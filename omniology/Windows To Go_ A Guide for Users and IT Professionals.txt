 CHAPTER 1  
 Introducing Windows To Go 
 Employees are becoming more and more mobile. On the road, they often work from 
personal devices, in a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) to work scenario. They might 
use company-provisioned laptops as well, and from home they may connect remotely 
to corporate desktop PCs. In these scenarios and others they connect through virtual 
private networks (VPNs) and virtual desktops. Beyond that, though, some users, while 
on company property, are required to roam from workstation to workstation to do their 
jobs. In the former situation, employees often have their own computers, laptops, or 
mobile devices. When users do have to roam from PC to PC, they often log in to a domain 
and have access to a roaming user profile to make their computing experience the same 
no matter which computer they log onto. There are other scenarios though where these 
types of solutions won’t work, and other solutions are required. 
 As an example, there are instances where certain employees aren’t assigned a specific 
computer, even when they are on company property. They might connect using a Virtual 
Private Network (VPN) or through the cloud. They can also use Windows To Go. Whatever 
the case, they need to access an operating system. Some users must have access to an 
operating system when in remote offices, even when they can’t or don’t have the ability 
to employ a laptop or other mobile device. Users might be consultants, too, and simply 
not have the authorization required to access a machine in an enterprise, although guest 
machines might be available for those contract workers. All of these scenarios, as well 
as others, present a problem for network administrators. These users need access to an 
operating system even when a personal computing device isn’t available. This is where 
Windows To Go comes in. 
 Windows To Go offers a way for mobile, corporate employees to work more 
efficiently by enabling them to access a personalized Windows workspace from any 
Windows-based PC that meets Windows To Go host requirements. These workspaces, 
which users carry with them, are stored on portable USB drives, and the users simply 
insert the drive and boot the PC to gain access. Of course, the host PC must be able to 
boot to the device, but most can be configured to do that without much effort. 
 
■ Tip  It’s important to note that Windows To Go is not meant to replace desktops, laptops, 
or other mobile devices, but equally important to understand is that it can provide an alternate 
workplace option when one is required. You’ll learn the pros and cons of when you’d opt to 
use Wiindows to Go as a solution (and when you wouldn’t) as you read through this book.  

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING WINDOWS TO GO
2
 Getting Started with Windows To Go 
 Network administrators create Windows To Go workspaces using the Windows To Go 
Creator from Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 Enterprise machines. Although many types of 
computers can serve as hosts, only Enterprise machines can be used to create Windows 
To Go drives. If you aren’t already aware, these versions of the Windows operating 
systems can only be acquired by corporations and enterprises that have signed on with 
Microsoft’s Volume Licensing agreement. Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 Enterprise are not 
available for download or on DVD to the general public. 
 For those companies that do opt for the Enterprise release and decide to provision 
USB drives to their employees, there is the option to customize the Windows image to 
match the needs of the environment. Network administrators can add device drivers, 
software packages like Microsoft Office, third-party products like Adobe Reader, 
proprietary applications, and they can even customize desktop backgrounds and 
screensavers, among other things. Larger corporations might have multiple images, one 
for each department or project group. 
 With regard to security, administrators can enable Bitlocker to protect the drives they 
commission with a password. I’ll suggest you always do that. If the drive is lost or stolen, 
it can’t be used without this information. Also, because all that’s physically lost is a USB 
drive, the cost of replacement is low. Reimaging a USB drive if it becomes corrupt is just 
as easy as making one as well, making Windows To Go an affordable and easy-to-manage 
alternative for those businesses that can use it. Figure  1-1 shows the Windows To Go 
Creator on a Windows 10 Enterprise computer. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING WINDOWS TO GO

■ Note   Windows To Go workspaces (USB drives) can only be created from Windows 
8-based and Windows 10 Enterprise computers. 
 The Differences Between Windows To Go and a 
Typical Windows Installation 
 For the end user, the Windows To Go experience is very similar to the "regular" Windows 
experience. It doesn’t matter how you achieve that experience; the user can run Windows 
on a desktop or laptop computer, or even from a pool of available virtual desktops in 
a domain. However, Windows To Go is not a replacement for an operating system in 
the long term, and there are limitations to what it can provide. Here are a few items to 
consider, at least in terms of an employee’s standpoint:
• 
  The host computer’s internal disks are offline 
• 
 Trusted Platform Module (TPM) isn’t used (Trusted Boot can be) 
• 
  Hibernation is disabled by default 
 Figure 1-1.  The Windows To Go Creator is a wizard-based application. Use it to create 
Windows To Go drives.  
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING WINDOWS TO GO

• 
 Windows Recovery Environment (RE) isn’t available 
• 
 The Store is available but with limitations 
• 
 Users can roam from computer to computer with a single 
Windows To Go drive 
 Let’s take a look at each of these items in more detail. 
 Internal Disks Are Offline 
 First, note that internal disks are offline. This means that the host computer’s data can’t 
be accessed by the Windows To Go user. Likewise, when a Windows To Go drive is 
inserted into a system while that system is running, the Windows To Go drive will not be 
listed in Windows Explorer. 
 TPM Can’t Be Used 
 In addition, a TPM chip can’t be used. That’s because TPM chips are associated with 
a single computer, and Windows To Go users access multiple systems. Because of this, 
BitLocker is used in its place. BitLocker Drive Encryption requires the user to input a 
password before Windows on the USB drive can be loaded, thus protecting the drive from 
unauthorized access. See Figure  1-2 . 
 Hibernation and Sleep Considerations 
 Hibernation is disabled by default to make sure that the Windows To Go workspace can 
be moved from computer to computer easily. Hibernation could slow down the process of 
removing the drive when the user is finished working. It’s possible to enable hibernation 
using Group Policy settings though. 
 There are additional Group Policy settings to consider, including modifying standby 
sleep states on the host PC when the computer has booted to a Windows To Go workspace. 
Sleep states could make the Windows To Go user think that the computer has shut 
 Figure 1-2.  BitLocker Drive Encryption protects the Windows To Go drive by requiring 
a password 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING WINDOWS TO GO

down, when in reality it’s only sleeping, and that user may simply remove his or her USB 
drive. When a USB workspace is removed without going through the proper shut-down 
procedures it’s possible for the drive to become corrupt. It’s possible that harm could come 
to the host computer as well. If you enable this policy setting ( Disallow standby sleep 
states (S1-S3) when starting from a Windows To Go  workspace) , the Windows To Go 
workspace cannot use the standby states to cause the PC to enter sleep mode.  
 Windows Recovery Environment Is Not Available 
 The next item to understand is that the Windows RE isn’t available to the end user. 
There’s no way to refresh or reset a Windows To Go drive. In cases where this is required, 
you should reimage the drive. This is because resetting to some manufacturer standard 
simply doesn’t work for a Windows To Go workspace. Thus, Windows RE is disabled. 
 Using the Windows Store 
 The Windows Store behavior differs somewhat for end users running Windows 8-based 
machines, depending on what operating system is on their Windows To Go drives. For 
those users with Windows 8.1, there is no difference; store apps can roam between 
multiple PCs. With Windows 8, the Windows Store is disabled by default. This has to do 
with how apps are licensed through the store and how they are associated with specific 
hardware. Through Group Policy though, the Windows Store can be enabled for a 
Windows To Go workspace for a single PC and Store apps can be used on that workspace. 
 Roaming with Windows To Go 
 
■ Note  When creating Windows To Go images, make sure the image contains all of 
the device drivers that could possibly be required by host PCs. You’ll learn about the 
requirements and the process for making images in various chapters in this book. 
 Finally, users can roam with Windows To Go. Windows To Go drives can be booted on 
multiple computers, as you know, but how this works is complex. Briefly, and there 
will be more in Chapter   2 , when a Windows To Go workspace is initially booted, that 
workspace detects all of the hardware on that host PC and loads the necessary drivers. 
The next time the same host is used, those drivers are ready and installed, and the host is 
identified easily. 
 
■ Caution   The applications that you want to add to the Windows To Go image (and 
workspace) need to support roaming. Some applications are bound to hardware and can 
cause problems when used on another machine. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING WINDOWS TO GO
6
 Hardware Requirements 
 Both the host and the USB drive must meet hardware requirements. USB drives must 
be “Windows To Go Certified” and host PCs must meet hardware, BIOS, boot, and 
architectural specifications among other things. When planning a Windows To Go 
deployment, hardware is of the utmost importance and one of the first areas to consider. 
 For end users, though, understand that their biggest concern and opportunity for 
failure is the actual process of booting to the device. You will give them a compatible USB 
drive, but in the end, the user is responsible for booting up the drive. Due to the nature of 
the process, differing firmware, BIOS settings, and so on, the boot process can go awry in 
many ways. Thus, it’s important to understand and possibly even educate your own users 
on how the boot process works, at least with regard to selecting compatible machines. 
 Selecting the USB Drives 
 The USB drives you select for Windows To Go workspaces must meet specific 
requirements. There is no specific brand or size that I will suggest, as the available 
options change as time passes and technology evolves. When purchasing these drives, 
though, make sure they are Windows To Go Certified; that’s all you need to do. Here’s 
what “certified” means, in a nutshell:
• 
 The drives are built specifically for high read and write speeds. 
They support thousands of random access input and output 
operation per second. The faster these specs are, the better 
Windows To Go will run. 
• 
 Certified drives are built to ensure they will boot and run on host 
hardware that meet host requirements put in place by Microsoft. 
Host requirements are detailed next, but they must run a 
compatible version of Windows 7, 8, or 10. 
• 
 Drives must be backed with a manufacturer warranty and should 
be built to last. 
 Selecting the Host PC 
 As with selecting USB drives to hold Windows To Go, you must select hosts that support 
it. Like USB drives, hosts go through a certification process as well. That process requires 
that the host run a compatible version of Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10. 
Windows RT won’t work, and Windows To Go can’t be used on Mac computers. 
 Beyond that, there are a few other things to understand about the host PC. First, 
the host computer must be capable of booting to a USB drive and USB boot up must be 
enabled. PCs that are certified for use with Windows 7 or later are capable of this, but 
settings might need to be changed in BIOS. There is a Windows To Go setting where 
administrators can enable this as well, as shown in Figure  1-3 . To find this, simply type 
Windows To Go at a Windows 8-based Start screen or search for it in the Windows 
10 search box on the Taskbar, then click Change Windows To Go Startup Options. If 
you’re using a Windows 7 host, you’ll want to take a look at the BIOS settings during 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING WINDOWS TO GO

startup. I usually opt for the newest and best machine I can find, which is often one 
running Windows 10. However, any compatible computer will do, provided it meets the 
requirements listed.

  You'll learn more about the processor requirements next, but for now note that 
the processor architecture must support the image on the Windows To Go drive. The 
processor must be 1 GHz or faster, and there must be at least 2 GB of Random Access 
Memory (RAM). DirectX9 graphics card with WDDM 1.2 or greater must also be installed 
in the machine. 
 Checking Architectural Compatibility 
 As noted earlier, the image on the Windows To Go drive needs to be compatible with 
the architecture of the host PC. Firmware must be compatible too. Table  1-1 shows the 
various scenarios and host PC requirements.  
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING WINDOWS TO GO

 One way to see the host processor’s specifications is to right-click This PC (on 
a Windows 10 machine) and click Properties. This opens the System window from 
Control Panel. There are multiple ways to get to this window from Windows 10 and 
other operating system versions. Once there, note what is available next to System 
Type. Figure  1-4 shows this PC is running a 64-bit operating system with an x-64 based 
processor. This host is also UEFI, so it can support a 64-bit Windows To Go image. 
 Figure 1-4.  Discover the host’s architectural specifications in the System window 
 Tips for Configuring the BIOS 
 If you’re sure you have a compatible host, and you want that host always to be able to 
boot to an inserted Windows To Go drive, for Windows 8 and up, use the Startup Options 
shown in Figure  1-3  to configure it. If you are using a Windows 7 machine or only want to 
allow the Windows To Go drive one time, you should make the change in the BIOS. 
 How you configure the BIOS isn’t the same for all computers. The manufacturer 
determines the method you’ll use to get into the settings and involves pressing a specific key 
during the normal startup process. That key could be F2, F9, F10, F12, or something else. 
Here are a few of the major manufacturer’s settings (although things can and do change):
• 
 Acer
• 
 BIOS F2 
•

 Summary 
 As users become more mobile it’s important to offer them a way to access an operating 
system while away from their own desktop or laptop. Windows To Go offers a way for 
these users to work in these scenarios and others by providing them with a personalized 
Windows workspace, which they can access from any compatible Windows-based PC. 
Windows To Go workspaces can be configured to meet any company’s needs and the 
image on them can be modified and personalized in hundreds of ways. These workspaces 
are stored on portable USB drives that users can take with them. In this chapter you 
learned what is required of both the physical drive that the workspace that it is configured 
to use, as well as the host that the drive is booted with. 
 In Chapter   2 you’ll learn how end users work with Windows To Go. You’ll learn more 
about the boot process, how to sign in, how to navigate Windows, and how to access 
resources, among other things.

 CHAPTER 2  
 Using Windows To Go 
 In Chapter   1 you learned quite a bit about Windows To Go, including the differences 
between a traditional installation of Windows and Windows running on a USB drive. You 
learned what is required of the host computer, which must meet specific certification 
requirements for both hardware and software. You learned that processor architecture 
has to match between the host and the Windows To Go drive, and that limitations 
exist with regard to the Windows Store for Windows 8 and access to local resources 
(specifically the host's internal hard drive) for all operating systems. In this chapter we’ll 
continue along that same path, keeping a focus on the end user and getting started with 
Windows To Go from an end-user perspective, including what problems can arise for 
them. Let’s look once more at the reasons an enterprise would employ Windows To Go 
before we get started, and let’s look at a few other ways you could use Windows To Go that 
you may not have thought of. 
 Additional Thoughts on Windows To Go 
 In a nutshell, Windows To Go offers users the ability to roam from machine to machine or 
building to building while maintaining access to an operating system, all without having 
to carry a laptop or tablet with them. All they need is access to a compatible PC running 
a compatible operating system. Companies can put their own image on a Windows To 
Go drive, and can easily replicate, provision, replace, and otherwise manage the drives 
once a system is put into place. Windows To Go is stored on a USB stick and protected 
by BitLocker, so loss is more easily handled monetarily when things go awry versus what 
happens when a user misplaces, damages, or otherwise loses a laptop. It can also be used 
to share PCs. In addition, traveling with a USB drive instead of other mobile hardware lets 
users travel lighter. 
 Beyond this, at least with regard to how you’d use Windows To Go, there are a few 
things that you might not have considered when thinking about Windows To Go. For 
instance, think about how Windows To Go could be used in a classroom setting or as a 
corporate training tool. Instructors can give students access to an operating system that 
they can work with and on while in class, and then take home with them to continue their 
studies when class is over. In many scenarios, there would be no need to set up a lab or 
have specialized software. In any training setting, users can move around easily, and can 
sit at any workstation they like, facilitating small group work and similar scenarios. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
12
 Additionally, think about how users in larger companies with domains could use 
Windows To Go effectively, specifically to access the domain when required. Although 
they could save to an external storage medium, like Dropbox or OneDrive, it is possible to 
direct users to save on the actual domain servers. In this instance, users are supplied with 
direct access to domain resources with a feature called DirectAccess. DirectAccess is only 
one of the ways Windows To Go users can work from a Windows To Go workspace and 
still maintain a corporate identity and be managed by administrators. 
 Finally, having a Windows To Go workspace in highly volatile environments, or 
those that simply aren't stable, enables users to get back to work quickly should their own 
laptops or PCs encounter problems. Getting users back to work quickly, perhaps even in 
a lab setting, enables them to work more efficiently. Of course, users could work inside 
their Windows To Go workspace from home and not have to worry much about how 
those systems work or how they should save data when necessary. 
 
■ Caution  Remember that Windows To Go isn’t always the best solution in many 
situations. It can’t be used in USB hubs, you should always enable Bitlocker, and it isn’t a 
long-term solution. 
 Creating a Basic Windows To Go Workspace 
 In this chapter you’ll start by building your own Windows To Go workspace that you can 
experiment with. Later in this book you’ll learn how network administrators do it using 
other tools, and how they create unique images and deploy workspaces to users, among 
other things. For now though, just having your own personal Windows To Go stick is a 
good place to start. 
 To create your own Windows To Go workspace you’ll need a few things. First, you’ll 
need a USB drive that is certified for Windows To Go use. When shopping for this drive, 
look for the appropriate labeling that defines it as such prior to the purchase. You should 
see something like what’s shown in Figure  2-1 , which specifically states that it supports 
Windows To Go. 
 Figure 2-1.    Choose a USB drive that specifically states that it supports Windows To Go. 
There are many manufacturers that make these drives as well as those that are already 
installed with Windows To Go.       
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
13
 With that in hand, you’ll need to acquire a copy of Windows 8, 8.1, or 10 Enterprise 
and install it on a computer, perhaps in a lab setting but, at least for now, on something 
other than a production machine. You don’t have to join a domain to get started here 
either, although you can should you desire. You will need administrator privileges once 
you have an Enterprise version of Windows installed, up, and running. Finally, you'll need 
a genuine copy of the operating system you want to place on the Windows To Go drive, 
complete with a valid license. Once that's all in order, continue here. 
 
■ Note  Once you’ve placed an operating system on a Windows To Go drive and created 
the workspace, you can’t upgrade that system. If you want to put a different operating 
system on the drive, you’ll have to reimage it. 
 When you’re ready, log on to your Windows Enterprise machine. From here you’ll 
access the Windows To Go Creator and create your first Windows To Go workspace. Here 
are the steps: 
 
 1. 
 Sign in with administrator privileges to a Windows 8, 8.1, or 10 
Enterprise PC. 
 
 2. 
  Locate a copy of the operating system you want to use for 
Windows To Go, and place the .wim file on the PC, a network 
share, USB drive, or DVD, or otherwise make it accessible. 
 
 3. 
  Locate the product identification number associated with the 
Windows image you want to use, as applicable. 
 
WHERE TO ACQUIRE WINDOWS ENTERPRISE
 Windows Enterprise isn’t available from a box store, and you can’t simply buy a 
copy of it from Microsoft either. Windows Enterprise is available through a volume 
licensing agreement from Microsoft or with a subscription to Microsoft Developer 
Network (MSDN). This means it is generally used for professional purposes in 
larger organizations, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be used elsewhere and in other 
situations. 
 Additionally, the Community Technology Preview (CTP) of Service Pack 1 for System 
Center 2012 Configuration Manager includes support for user self-provisioning 
of Windows To Go drives. You can download an evaluation copy of Configuration 
Manager 2012 SP1 CTP from the   Microsoft Download Center  . 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO

■ Caution  The USB drive you use should already be initialized and a volume created on it 
prior to provisioning the drive with Windows To Go. If you aren’t sure if your drive is or is not 
initialized, it likely is. Go ahead and try to run the wizard and address the situation only if the 
need arises. 
 
 4. 
 Insert the Windows To Go Certified USB drive you purchased 
into a USB 2.0 or higher port on the Windows Enterprise 
machine. 
 
 5. 
 Search for Windows To Go from a search window and in the 
results select Windows To Go Creator Wizard. If you don’t see 
this as an option:
 a. 
 Open Control Panel. 
 b. 
  Change from Category to Large Icons, if applicable. 
   c. 
   Click Windows To Go. See Figure  2-2 .

 6. 
  If applicable, in the User Account Control dialog box, confirm 
you want to use this program. 
 
 7. 
  When prompted to choose the USB drive you’d like to use 
for Windows To Go, select the drive and then click Next. If 
you encounter errors, as shown in Figure  2-3 , you’ll need to 
correct them.

media such as flash drives. If you want to perform advanced partitioning functions with a 
USB drive, consider reading about DiskPart   here  before you start.

BEST PRACTICES: PASSWORDS
 Keep this in mind when creating passwords:
• 
 Use a combination of words, symbols, numbers, and upper- and 
lower-case letters. 
• 
 Don’t use your name, your dog’s name, kids’ names, and so on. 
Avoid words like “Password” and “User.” 
• 
 Avoid including personal information such as social security 
numbers or addresses. 
• 
 Try to use made-up words, and avoid words in the dictionary. An 
example of such would be ILuvCatz54!x. 
• 
 Avoid consecutive numbers and letters. 
• 
 Don’t use a password you use for other places, like web sites, 
e-mail accounts, bank accounts, and so on. 
 
 13. 
 Wait for the process to complete, which could take up to 
30 minutes. 
 
■ Note  Using BitLocker to encrypt your Windows To Go USB drive will protect the drive 
with a password, also called a key. 
 
 14. 
 Configure the Windows To Go startup options as desired. 
 
 15. 
 Once completed click Yes or No to boot to the new drive now 
or to wait. See Figure  2-6 . 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
19
 
 16. 
  Click Save and Restart or Save and Close, as desired.      
 
■ Note   The first time you boot to the Windows To Go drive you’ll be prompted to set up 
Windows, just as you would with any brand-new operating system. You might want to do that 
before giving the drive to an end user. Unless you’re using an Enterprise image, you’ll also be 
prompted to input a product ID. In all instances you’ll need to activate the operating system.  
 Troubleshooting BitLocker in the Windows To Go 
Creation Process 
 Like anything, there are several reasons why the Windows To Go creation process could 
fail. As noted in the first few steps of the tutorial, sometimes the Windows To Go Creator 
wizard simply won’t appear in the search results. As noted, in this instance you can open 
the wizard from Control Panel using one of the other icon views. It’s also possible that 
the USB drive you’ve selected isn’t compatible for one reason or another. You saw this in 
Figure  2-3 . Perhaps it’s not a large enough drive or isn’t Windows To Go certified. Whatever 
the case, you’ll be informed and will need to remedy the situation before moving forward. 
 Figure 2-6.  At the end of the process, choose whether or not to boot to the drive now or wait       
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
20
 Some problems are a little more complex though. For instance, at least in our 
scenario where we’re using the wizard to create a single drive, you might not be able to 
enable BitLocker during the creation process. This can be caused by restrictions that have 
been applied to your computer, set by Group Policy in an enterprise or with local policies 
on a local machine. These policies are located in the  Computer Configuration \ Policies \ 
Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ BitLocker Drive Encryption folder 
of the Group Policy editor. See Figure  2-7 . 
 Figure 2-7.  BitLocker Drive Encryption can be restricted in Group Policy 
 The reason why this happens is that the Windows To Go drive is considered a 
removable drive, and often policies are set to restrict what can be done with those types of 
drives by end users. Those restrictions can limit the use of BitLocker for you, too. Here are 
a few things to consider should you find yourself in this position:
 Open the Removable Data Drives folder in Group Policy, 
shown in Figure  2-8 , and check the setting for Control use 
of BitLocker on removable drives . If this setting is disabled 
BitLocker cannot be applied to removable drives, and thus, 
the Windows To Go Creator wizard fails to add a BitLocker 
password at this point. Remove the restriction to resolve this 
problem. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
21
 In the same Removable Data Drives folder, check the 
setting for Configure use of smart cards on removable 
data drives . If enabled along with the option to  Require use 
of smart cards on removable data drives, the BitLocker 
configuration step might fail if you did not sign on with your 
smart card credentials before starting the Windows To Go 
Creator process. 
 In the same folder, check the status for Configure use 
of passwords for removable data drives. If this setting is 
enabled and the password is required to be complex, the 
computer must be able to contact the domain controller to 
verify that the password you’ve typed meets set requirements. 
If it can’t access this controller, BitLocker drive encryption will 
not succeed. 
 Figure 2-8.    Windows To Go is considered a removable drive, so any Group Policy settings 
applicable to these drives will apply here 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
22
 Completing and Troubleshooting the 
Boot-Up Process 
 You learned in Chapter   1 how to use Windows to allow a computer to boot from a 
Windows To Go drive. There’s a graphical user interface just for that purpose. If you 
haven’t yet configured your computer to allow booting to Windows To Go, do that now:
 
 1. 
 Click Win+W or open a Search window.  
 
 2. 
 Type “Change Windows To Go startup options” and click enter.  
 
 3. 
 Select Yes. 
 
 4. 
 Click Save Changes. 
 Make sure to also set the firmware to boot to USB first, also outlined in Chapter   1    . 
When you’re ready, continue on to boot to your Windows To Go workspace for the first time. 
 Booting Your Windows To Go Workspace 
 Now it's time to see how the new Windows To Go drive works. Follow these steps to boot 
to your Windows To Go workspace:
 
 1. 
 Wake up or turn on the host PC.  
 
 2. 
 Insert the Windows To Go USB drive directly into a USB 3.0 or 
USB 2.0 port on the PC; it won’t work if you plug it into a USB 
extender. 
 
 3. 
 Turn on or restart the PC. 
 
 4. 
  If your Windows To Go drive is protected with BitLocker, when 
prompted type the password. 
 When you boot your Windows To Go drive for the first time, it’ll look like and act like 
you’re booting to a brand-new operating system that’s never been used. You’ll be required 
to work through the normal setup process, just as you would with any new machine. The 
Windows To Go workspace will take inventory of the host machine and load any necessary 
drivers, and you’ll be prompted to input a product ID, configure settings, and do all of 
the other necessary setup tasks required of any new Windows installation. Once that’s 
done, it’s done. You won’t have to do it again. However, there might be a small delay when 
booting to a computer you’ve never booted to before, while the applicable drivers load. 
There will be more on setting up a new Windows To Go drive later in the section entitled 
Working With a New Installation of Windows To Go, later in this chapter.   
 Explore Common Boot Problems 
 Like anything, more than a few things can go wrong when trying to boot to a Windows To 
Go drive. Most of the time it’s a problem with the firmware, which has not been configured 
to boot to a USB drive. Problems occur when the PC ignores the Windows To Go drive, 
for whatever reason. Other times it’s a mismatch between the host and the drive. Refer to 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
23
Table   1-1  in Chapter   1   for compatibility information. However, sometimes the problem is 
more complex. On occasion you’ll run across a drive that will boot but won’t work properly 
because it isn’t imaged with a genuine copy of Windows. However there are other things 
that can go awry. Here are few things to look at should you still have problems:
• 
 Make sure the most up-to-date BIOS is installed. 
• 
 Verify the drive is inserted into the host and not into an external 
USB hub. 
• 
 If the drive won’t boot while inserted into a host’s USB 3.0 port, 
try a USB 2.0 port. 
 Explore Hardware Issues 
 If your troubleshooting techniques prove that the problem doesn't stem from a BIOS 
or port issue, perhaps you’re trying to boot to an incompatible host like a Mac. Mac 
computers don’t support Windows To Go. Additionally, you can’t use Windows To Go on 
devices with ARM processors, such as those found in the older Windows RT machines. 
So, explore that next and verify the host is compatible and is of the right type and 
architecture. 
 Finally, you might see errors that state that Windows is “installing devices” even 
though devices were installed the last time you connected Windows To Go to a specific 
host. This sometimes happens when third-party drivers for different hardware use the 
same device IDs or service names, and when Windows To Go is used to roam among 
these devices. Problems occur when conflicts occur. This is a more complicated error and 
will require the services of a network administrator to straighten out, and it is beyond the 
scope of this chapter. 
 Explore Group Policy Boot Parameter Settings 
 You learned earlier that problems can occur when creating Windows To Go drives 
with regard to trying to enable BitLocker when Group Policy settings prohibit such 
configurations. Likewise, Group Policy can be used to allow or disallow booting to 
portable operating systems. If you are having boot issues and you think this is the case, 
from the host or from the domain controller as applicable, navigate to \\ Computer 
Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ Portable Operating 
System \ Windows To Go Default Startup Options and take a look at the settings. See 
Figure  2-9 . 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
24
 If the policy is disabled, you need to enable this policy to let Windows look for a 
connected USB Windows To Go drive. Even when disabled though, note that a user can 
still configure the option to boot to USB in the firmware settings. If you do not configure 
this policy setting, Administrators can use the Windows To Go Startup Options to enable 
or disable booting from a USB drive, as outlined in Chapters   1 and   2 . 
 Working with a New Installation of Windows To Go 
 The first time you boot to a new Windows To Go workspace you’ll be prompted to work 
through the required setup tasks, just as you would with any new Windows installation. 
You’ll want to be patient through this first experience, as it might take a little more time 
than you think it should for Windows to start, and the Windows To Go workspace might 
even reboot before the setup screen appears. 
 Setup tasks include but are not limited to the following:
• 
 Setting your country, language, keyboard layout and time zone.  
• 
 Accepting the terms of volume licensing for Windows Enterprise 
editions or inputting a product ID for other versions.  
• 
 Choosing to use Express settings or configuring setting manually. 
• 
 Connecting to a wireless network (Ethernet will be automatically 
connected) 
 Figure 2-9.    If boot problems persist, consider Group Policy Windows To Go Startup 
Options settings 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
25
• 
  Waiting while updates are applied. 
• 
  Choosing how you’ll connect, perhaps joining an Azure AD or a 
domain, or none. 
• 
  Creating an account and entering a password and password hint.    
 Once it’s set up, the Desktop will appear. Figure  2-10 shows a Windows 10 Windows 
To Go Desktop. If you open File Explorer you won’t see the host’s hard drive, although you 
will see shared resources if you opt to set your network to Private when prompted, if you 
join a home group, or if you turn on File and Printer Sharing manually.  
  Figure 2-10.  A Windows To Go desktop looks exactly like a regular Windows desktop 
 Now, find out if Windows has been activated. You can do that from any compatible 
computer, but on a Windows 10 machine you do it by clicking Start and then Settings. 
Click Update and Security, and then Activation. If necessary, work through the process to 
activate your new workspace. 
 
WINDOWS TO GO WORKSPACES CAN’T BE ACCESSED 
BY THE HOST PC
 By default, when Windows To Go workspaces are created, drive letters are not 
automatically assigned to the new workspace. That’s why you can’t see the 
Windows To Go drive when it’s plugged into a running computer. However, if you 
really need to access the files on the Windows To Go drive from a host, you can use 
diskmgmt.msc or DiskPart to assign a drive letter to the workspace. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
26
 Accessing Personal and Local Resources 
 You can access some local resources when logged into a Windows To Go workspace, 
and there are ways to access your personal files. However, when you’re logged in to a 
Windows To Go workspace, it as if you are working only from that operating system and 
appears as though no host is involved. Thus, you can’t access files and folders that are 
stored on the host, and you can’t access the host’s hard drive. 
 Here’s an example. Take a look at Figure  2-11 . Notice that you can only see Local Disk 
(C:) and the host’s DVD drive. You can’t access or see the host’s hard disk. You can access 
some local resources though. For instance, you can see and use the host’s DVD drive. You 
can install software from that drive onto your Windows To Go workspace, provided Group 
Policies don’t prevent it. You can access printers and other resources that are connected 
to a network you’ve joined and have appropriate permissions for, perhaps those available 
in a home group or those made public on the local network. 
 Figure 2-11.  Use the host’s DVD drive to install hardware onto the Windows To Go drive 
 With regard to personal files and folders, there are several ways to work and to store 
data using a portable workspace. Users can store data to a SharePoint site, for instance, 
or to a third-party online solution, like Dropbox. Corporations might put something else 
into effect like DirectAccess. You’ll learn about this in Chapter 3. 
 For small business or home users, roaming technicians, or independent contractors 
(among other things), something simpler might be in order. One solution is to use 
OneDrive. It’s easy to log on to OneDrive from the Windows To Go workspace, and is 
the solution I use most often (as an independent contractor). Avoid saving data to the 
Windows To Go workspace though; if the drive is lost, so is your data.

 6. 
  If prompted to complete additional tasks, such as receiving 
and inputting a confirmation code, do so.  
 
 7. 
 Set a PIN (personal identification number) if desired, when 
prompted, or opt to skip this step. 
 
 8. 
  Open File Explorer by clicking the folder icon on the Taskbar

 10. 
 If you have files saved there already, you’ll have access to 
them, as shown in figure  2-13 . 
 To sign in with a Microsoft Account from a Windows 8-based Windows To Go image:
 
 1. 
  Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, and 
then tap Change PC settings. 
 (If you’re using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the 
screen, move the mouse pointer up, click Settings, and then 
click Change PC settings.) 
 
 2. 
  Tap or click Accounts, and then tap or click Your account.  
 
 3. 
 Click Connect to a Microsoft Account. 
 
 4. 
 Select the desired option. You will need to choose among these:
 a. 
 Connect to an existing Microsoft Account 
  b. 
  Sign up with the e-mail address you use most often  
 c. 
 Get a new e-mail address 
 
 5. 
  Work through the resulting prompts to complete the process. 
 Figure 2-13.  OneDrive offers a place to save your work while using Windows To Go 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
29
 
■ Caution   It isn’t a good idea (or a Best Practice) to save files to the Windows To Go 
workspace. If the USB drive is lost, so is the data. Save instead to OneDrive or something 
similar, using folder redirection, or another, similar, enterprise solution. 
 Note that other local resources might exist, like printers or scanners. Figure  2-14 
shows two things. The first is a locally attached printer. This particular printer is attached 
to the host that the Windows To Go drive has booted with. The Windows To Go user can 
print to that printer. The second is a printer on the local area network attached to another 
computer. This is available via the Web and is accessible because, in this instance, the 
Windows To Go workspace has been enabled to use File and Printer Sharing and has 
been joined the local home group. This won’t always be the case of course, but do note 
that some local resources will be available to your end users. 
 
■ Note  When you sign into your Microsoft Account, even on a Windows To Go drive, 
language settings, keyboard preferences, wallpaper, themes and various other settings will 
be applied. Once this happens, you’ll feel a sense of familiarity, and once you set up all of 
you applications you might find it hard to tell if you’re working on a real host or a USB stick. 
 Figure 2-14.    Some local resources are available to Windows To Go users, like printers 
directly attached to hosts and wireless or Internet printers 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
30
 Accessing Domain Resources 
 In the previous section I talked about how to access local resources while using a 
Windows To Go drive on a host, on a local area network. I enabled File and Printer 
sharing, and I joined the available home group to get to all of these resources. Local 
networks are a lot different from domains though. When you use Windows To Go with 
domain credentials, a different set of things occurs. 
 Before continuing here, if you are in a position to join a domain by connecting to a 
domain server, you can do so by following these steps. Note that these are instructions for 
a Windows 10 Windows To Go workspace:
 
 1. 
 Click Start and click Settings. 
 
 2. 
 Click System. 
 
 3. 
 Click About. 
 
 4. 
 Click Join a Domain. 
 
 5. 
 Input the domain credentials. See Figure  2-15 .  
 Much of the time though this isn’t how joining a domain works for the end user. The 
Windows To Go workspace is generally already set and users connect to the domain using 
the same tools they’d use from a laptop or other mobile devices. There are likely even 
shortcuts on the Desktop to facilitate these connections, so that there is similarity and 
familiarity to lessen support calls and technical issues, especially if VPNs are involved. 
 Beyond leaving users to their own devices (so to speak), there are other ways to 
manage domain users and give them access to domain resources. One is Offline Domain 
Join. This feature lets administrators join workspaces to the domain without the devices 
 Figure 2-15.  If you need to join a domain, do so from the System window 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
31
being connected to the company intranet. This is one way to enable access. However, with 
users connecting from so many different devices, other options might be used instead. 
 One other option is to use DirectAccess. The intranet will have to be configured 
to support it, but once in place DirectAccess provides easy access to resources on the 
company domain. When users log on to the workspace using their domain credentials, 
they can access the domain resources as if they were directly connected to the intranet. 
 Best Practices for End Users 
 It’s important to educate users as well as network administrators on Microsoft’s Best 
Practices list for Windows To Go. This list summarizes the most important things to keep 
in mind:
• 
  Always shut down Windows To Go like you would any machine.  
• 
  Wait for Windows To Go to completely shut down before 
removing the drive. 
• 
  Although you can, it’s best not to insert the Windows To Go drive 
into a running computer. Turn off the computer, insert the drive, 
and turn the computer back on. 
• 
 Plug the Windows To Go drive directly into a USB port. Don’t use 
a USB hub. 
• 
  If you can, use a USB 3.0 port with Windows To Go. If that doesn't 
work, use USB 2.0. 
• 
  Avoid installing non-Microsoft core USB drivers onto a Windows 
To Go workspace. 
• 
 In a large environment, select and use a standard USB drive that is 
certified for Windows To Go and deploy it across the organization. 
Consistency is the key to management happiness. 
• 
  Plan how users can use Windows To Go, and set Group Policies 
appropriately. 
• 
  Offer information on how to enable booting on host computers, 
and educate your IT department or help desk on how to help 
users who have problems with the boot process. 
 Troubleshooting Additional End-User 
Experience Issues 
 Your end users will likely have issues that haven’t been addressed here, and while there is 
no way to address everything, there are a few common questions users ask and mistakes 
they make that can cause problems. One of the most common is when the user makes a 
habit of removing the Windows To Go drive while the operating system is running. When 

CHAPTER 2 ■ USING WINDOWS TO GO
32
this happens the host computer could stall or freeze. In this case, and if the user reinserts 
the drive within a minute of removing it, it should pick up where it left off. If not, or if the 
user inserts the drive into a different port on the host, problems will likely ensue. It might 
be that the host computer turns itself off, or the Windows To Go drive becomes corrupt. 
 Users might also run into issues where they want Windows To Go to hibernate or 
go to sleep, and they express concerns about why it does not. Windows To Go doesn’t 
support hibernation by default. Although network administrators can change this default 
behavior through Group Policy settings, they often do not, because when a Windows To 
Go workspace hibernates, it will only resume successfully on the exact same hardware. 
Since this likely won’t happen, and because the user state will be lost during the 
transition, hibernation is disabled. 
 If you are positive that you will use a specific Windows To Go drive on the same 
computer it uses to hibernate with, you can enable hibernation using the Windows 
To Go Group Policy setting, Allow hibernate (S4) when started from a Windows 
To Go workspace that is located at \\ Computer Configuration \ Administrative 
Templates \ Windows Components \ Portable Operating System \ in the Local Group 
Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) 
 Another problem users run into is with applications installed on a Windows To 
Go drive. Although installed applications should work most of the time, issues arise on 
occasion. If an application uses a specific hardware binding for licensing reasons (or 
digital rights) those applications might not run on different hardware. In this case the user 
will only be able to run the applications on the same host on which it was first installed. 
 Finally, and along those same lines, for Windows 8 users, note that Windows Store 
apps use a similar hardware binding for managing licenses. When a user tries to run 
store apps on more than one machine, problems ensue. That's why the Windows Store 
is disabled by default in Windows To Go on Windows 8. If it were enabled there would 
be licensing issues when using apps purchased in the Store. With Windows 8.1 and up 
though, the licensing used by the Windows Store has been updated. These problems have 
been resolved. 
 Summary 
 Getting a Windows To Go drive up and running and using it to experiment while learning 
is an excellent place to start your Windows To Go studies. You did that in this chapter. 
Learning how the system boots and what to expect is also important. You certainly need 
to know what your end users will experience and what problems they might encounter. 
In the rest of the chapters we’ll look at Windows To Go from an administrator’s point of 
view, starting with Chapter   3  , where we begin to prepare the enterprise for Windows To Go.

 CHAPTER 3  
 Prepare Your Small Business, 
School, or Enterprise for 
Windows To Go  
 You learned in the last two chapters that the Windows To Go Creator is available in 
Windows 8-based and Windows 10 Enterprise editions and that Windows To Go USB 
drives are generally provisioned in larger enterprises. Those drives are offered to mobile 
employees to provide an operating system when a laptop or tablet isn’t available. Small 
businesses also use Windows To Go, though, as do educational institutions. As long as an 
Enterprise edition is available, a solution is available. 
 In this chapter I’ll touch on three scenarios (business, education, and enterprise), 
and what kinds of things must be considered before any Windows To Go solution is put 
into place. Before we start though, note that when I mention small business, I’m thinking 
along the lines of a company that has fewer than 20 or so computers. There are midsized 
businesses too, perhaps up to 500, and enterprise businesses have more than that, and 
can range up to the thousands. If you’re still wondering if Windows To Go will suit your 
specific needs though in whatever scenario you have, let’s recap some ways Windows To 
Go can be used before we get started. 
 
■ Note  Even if you are planning to use Windows To Go in an enterprise, I suggest reading 
the entire chapter anyway, even the parts aimed at small businesses or single users. Create 
a few drives, configure Folder Redirection, and see what it’s like to use the drives too. 
 Possible scenarios you might run across include enabling users to work at home 
while also maintaining a corporate desktop experience. This is a common one. You might 
also want to enable sole proprietors or small business contractors to work away from the 
office without having to worry about carrying a laptop or tablet, or to enable all users to 
travel lightly when they are headed somewhere a host computer is available to them on a 
temporary basis, and where the work is short term, perhaps as little as an hour or a single 
afternoon. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
34
 With regard to education, teachers can use Windows To Go to provide a workstation 
that students can use both at school and at home, provided they can find a computer they 
can use to boot with. Students can save their work to a cloud drive, and whatever laptops 
are available for students can be used sparingly and only for those students for whom 
Windows To Go won’t work. 
 
■ Note  Although Windows To Go isn’t meant to replace desktops or mobile devices, it can 
provide a short-term solution to unique problems that enterprises encounter with users who 
roam from computer to computer or travel from job site to job site. 
 In this chapter you’ll learn how to get started with Windows To Go in various 
scenarios. You’ll inventory your current enterprise infrastructure, as applicable to your 
situation, to see if you have everything you need. When appropriate, you’ll learn how to 
put necessary measures in place to make these technologies work, such as redirecting 
a folder on a Windows To Go workspace to a cloud drive and configuring Folder 
Redirection on a server. You’ll learn how to configure Group Policy in specific scenarios 
and explore various ways to enable users to save data and user profiles. You’ll also learn a 
little about DirectAccess in an enterprise. 
 It’s important to note, also, before we get too far into this, that Windows Enterprise 
editions are only available through Volume Activation licensing. You’ll learn about this 
in the next chapter. You can get personal copies of Windows Enterprise if you have a 
Microsoft Developer Network account (MSDN) though, but these aren’t copies that are 
valid in a workplace. However, if you have an MSDN account and would like to follow 
along here, or if you’re only going to use the software for personal use, you can get a copy 
of it for testing. 
 Verify Your Domain Enterprise Infrastructure 
Is Ready 
 There are three scenarios I’ll cover in this chapter, Windows To Go in an enterprise, 
Windows To Go for small businesses, and Windows To Go for educational purposes. This 
part of the chapter deals with preparing your enterprise for Windows To Go, or perhaps 
more specifically, verifying that your enterprise is ready. Note that this is an extremely 
high-level overview; if you plan to deploy Windows To Go in an enterprise you’ll need to 
read a lot more about Windows To Go than this and there will be a lot of planning and 
testing involved before you can actually implement a solution. 
 If your company already has a system in place to create, modify, manage, and deploy 
operating system images to desktop computers, you likely have all you need to create and 
provision Windows To Go workspaces. That’s a lot easier said than done though. Quite a 
bit goes into making that possible, including planning, resources, manpower, software, 
and physical hardware, among other things. If your infrastructure already has a system 
in place to enable remote access to corporate resources, note that Windows To Go also 
works well and is compatible with those technologies. Windows To Go works well with 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
35
DirectAccess, folder redirection, and Remote Desktop, among other things. You’ll learn a 
little more about that in this chapter, and I’ll explore a few of these technologies. 
 Although all of these items are compatible and can function well with Windows To 
Go workspaces there are a few changes you might want to make, and I'll address that 
here too. Many enterprises create a separate image for the Windows To Go workspaces, 
images that are unique to the enterprise and specific to Windows To Go. Some create 
special groups of users and make appropriate changes to Group Policy for those groups 
as well. Do note though that if the infrastructure is already set for Windows To Go, these 
are minor issues. Let’s take a look first at what you’ll need to create your own images and 
deploy them as Windows To Go workspaces. 
 Infrastructure for Deploying Custom Windows Images 
 If you are a large enterprise and want to, or need to, create a Windows operating system 
that is unique to your environment, you can do that by creating custom Windows images. 
You certainly would not want to do this if you are a small business. It would take a lot less 
time to manually make changes to each computer in your workgroup than it would to set 
up a system that would enable you to do that. 
 There’s a lot that has to be put in place to create a custom Windows image though, 
such as one you might want to put on a Windows To Go drive, and what you’ll need to 
have it all configured before you can start. I’m not going to walk you through any specific 
deployment tasks in this section, such as how to set a specific server up to provide this 
functionality, that’s not the scope of this chapter, but I do want to mention the tools you’ll 
need to look into. 
 Since Windows 10 is the latest available operating system available, for the most 
part I’ll address Windows 10 in this chapter and beyond. However, you can create images 
with Windows 7 or 8, or others, to meet whatever your needs are. In that vein then, one 
of the first things you’ll want to do if you’re going to deploy Windows 10 on to Windows 
To Go drives and you’re going to want to be able to also manage upgrades beyond that, is 
to have a look at the Assessment and Deployment Toolkit (ADK). There is a new release 
to support Windows 10. Of course, there’s an older release for Windows 8 and 8.1. In this 
chapter, though, and throughout the book I’ll focus on what’s required to perform these 
tasks with Windows 10. Thus, make sure you understand that you’ll need the newer ADK 
for Windows 10 if that’s what you want to deploy. It’s backward compatible though; you 
can also use it to deploy Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1. Figure  3-1 shows the 
installation options. For good measure I’ll check all of them. You should too, if you’re 
new to ADK. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
36
 Windows ADK has existed for quite a while, as you likely know. However, 
improvements have been made to previous versions. Here’s a short list of the 
improvements you’ll find in this version of Windows ADK compared to older versions:
• 
 New runtime provisioning capabilities 
• 
 Contains the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer 
(Windows ICD) 
• 
 Incorporates updates for Deployment Image Servicing and 
Management (DISM) 
• 
 Includes updates for the User State Migration Tool (USMT) 
• 
 Includes updates for Windows Preinstallation Environment 
(Windows PE) 
 
■ Note  You’ll read a lot here about what needs to be upgraded and updated to support 
Windows 10. However, for mobile devices that you manage with Windows Intune (and other 
technologies) what was supported by Windows 8.1 is still fully supported in Windows 10. 
Keep in mind though that the new Windows 10 Mobile Device Management (MDM) settings 
will require updates to the MDM services. 
 Figure 3-1.  Install the Windows ADK for Windows 10 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
37
 You’ll need more than this though to get started, if you’re starting from scratch. You’ll 
need the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2013 Update 1, available from Microsoft. For this 
software and others, simply search for what you want, and browse to it from the results. 
As with the ADK, this has also been updated to support Windows 10, and again, note that 
older versions have not. 
 System Center Configuration Manager has also been updated for Windows 10 
support for both management and deployment. For more information about System 
Center Configuration Manager support for Windows 10, search at   www.Microsoft.com for 
Deploy Windows 10 with System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager. 
 The Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP) has also been updated to support 
Windows 10. To support specific aspects of management and deployment consider these 
minimum requirements, shown in Table  3-1 .  
 Table 3-1.  Product and Required Versions

 You’ll also need to update Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). If you need to 
update your server, here’s how to do it:
 
 1. 
 Select Options, and then click Products and Classifications. 
See Figure  3-2 . 
 
 2. 
 Expand the Products tree, and select at least Windows 10 and 
Windows 10 LTSB products. You can select others. 
 
 3. 
 Click OK. 
 
 4. 
  Expand the Synchronizations node, right-click, and choose 
Synchronize Now. 
 Figure 3-2.  Select the desired products 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
39
 There are other items you need to consider, and I suggest you do a lot of reading 
before you continue in your enterprise. However, I believe that if you are in a position to 
need custom Windows To Go images, you are also in a position to create them, once you 
update your current infrastructure to support it. 
 Verify your Small Business or Educational Setting 
Is Ready 
 If you have a small business that consists of a workgroup of say, fewer than 20 or 30 
computers, work in a small private school, or are a sole proprietor and use a workgroup 
or peer-to-peer network to share resources, all you really need to get started is a copy of 
Windows Enterprise and a few Windows To Go-compatible USB drives. You can use 
the Windows To Go Creator to create the workspaces and use an unaltered image of 
whatever Windows version you want to use. There’s no need to try to create a custom 
image just for a few people. Consider if you want to deploy Windows 7 or Windows 
8.1 workspaces, though, perhaps making that choice if you or your users are more 
comfortable with the older technology, but note that it’s certainly possible to create those 
workspaces with Windows 10. 
 Once the drives are created, and note that you’ll need a valid product ID for each, you 
and your employees can use the drives to do work. You’ll want to put some sort of solution 
in practice for users to save the data they create while using those drives though, so make 
sure to read the next few sections that have to do with folder redirection and offline files. 
You do not want users saving data to those USB workspaces. If the drive is lost, so is the 
data. Also, make sure to enable BitLocker on all of the drives as outlined in Chapter   2  .  
 Consider Folder Redirection, Offline Files, 
and UE-V 
 After you’ve met your infrastructure requirements, you need to consider how you are 
going to manage users and their data once you have the drives in place and users utilizing 
their Windows To Go drive. You can’t very well have users save data to their USB stick. 
You’ll need to make sure they are saving their data to a safe place each and every time. 
This can be difficult if users share a single computer, but it’s not that difficult to do for a 
Windows To Go drive. It’s also imperative that they have access to their data and personal 
user profiles from wherever they are too, so they’ll need some way to access the domain 
and enterprise resources. 
 
■ Note  A User Profile is a collection of settings that includes desktop backgrounds, 
screensavers, mouse preferences, sound settings, and other features. The general 
population, like users in home or small business settings, manages their own profiles. In an 
enterprise, the user profile settings can be managed by group policies. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO

 Folder Redirection for a Single Workspace and User 
 There are a few options available to you, as a network administrator, to manage user data. 
One of the most important things is to make sure that users don’t save data to their USB 
drives. That data would be lost if the drive were lost. Data must be stored elsewhere. To 
do that you configure Folder Redirection. This feature lets you forward the data users save 
to a network location on your domain servers, a SharePoint site, or even a public site like 
OneDrive or GoogleDrive. On an end user’s workspace, folder redirection is achieved 
from the Properties tab of the folder you want to redirect. 
 In this example I’ll redirect a folder for a Windows 10 workspace to OneDrive. Folder 
redirection hasn’t changed much so if you are using Windows 8 or 8.1 the directions are 
basically the same. If you’re following along at home, say, are part of a small business, 
and don’t have a domain to work with, you can perform these steps to get an idea of what 
folder redirection is like:
 
 1. 
 Open File Explorer. 
 
 2. 
 Locate the Documents folder or other folder to redirect.  
 
 3. 
 Right-click the folder and click Properties. 
 
 4. 
 Click the Location tab. See Figure  3-3 . 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
41
 
 5. 
 Click Move. 
 
 6. 
  Browse to the location of the drive to save to. 
 
 7. 
 Click Select Folder as shown in Figure  3-4 . 
 Figure 3-3.  Redirect a folder 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
42
 
 8. 
 Click OK. 
 Now, any data saved to the Documents folder for this user will be saved to the 
OneDrive folder instead. Users won’t notice any difference though, and there’s nothing to 
teach them to do to make it happen. Folder redirection is seamless to the user. 
 Offline Files for a Single Workspace and User 
 With folder redirection, users need to be able to access their files to work on them. This 
can be achieved through any Internet connection. But when users don’t save files to 
an Internet server like Google Drive or OneDrive, and instead save their files to a local 
network share, things get a little more complicated. 
 So one of the main problems that needs to be addressed with users working remotely 
on Windows To Go drives is that users won’t be able to access the personal files stored 
on network shares from just anywhere. If the files they need to access are stored, say, on 
a computer at their office, and there’s no domain or other solution in place to access that 
desktop computer remotely, they are simply out of luck. With offline files, users can access 
their personal data even when they aren’t connected to the network where the data resides. 
That’s because files are copied to the drive and are available to them when needed. This has 
several advantages:
• 
 Copies of important files are saved to the Windows To Go 
workspace, so they are available even when users can’t access 
their files via a network. 
• 
 Even if users have a way to access their files from a network share, 
if there’s no Internet connection and there is need for it, those 
files are still available to users from their drives. 
 Figure 3-4.  Select the desired folder to redirect data to 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
43
• 
 Users are not affected when a local network “goes down.” Users 
can continue to work without interruption. 
• 
  It’s easy to sync files once a network becomes available. Users 
simply need to click the Sync button if they are using Sync Center 
to perform this task. 
• 
 It’s possible to work with offline files when a network is slow and 
cumbersome. 
 Enable Offline Files and Folders 
 Before you can configure and use Offline Files you need to enable Offline Files. Here’s 
how to do that in Windows 10, and as noted before, performing these steps in other 
operating system versions is similar:
 
 1. 
  Open Control Panel and, if applicable, click Category under 
View by and click Large icons. See Figure  3-5 . 
 Figure 3-5.  Open Sync Center 
 
 2. 
 Click Sync Center. 
 
 3. 
 Click Manage offline files. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
44
 
 4. 
 Click Enable offline files. See Figure  3-6 . 
 
 5. 
 Click OK. 
 
 6. 
 Save any open work and restart the computer. 
 Once you’ve enabled this feature you’re ready to configure the files you want to make 
available offline. So now, connect to the local network that contains the files you want to 
copy, and locate the network resource. If you’re setting up offline files in a workgroup:
 
 1. 
 Open File Explorer. 
 
 2. 
 Expand Network. See Figure  3-7 . 
 Figure 3-6.  Enable offline files 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
45
 
 3. 
  Navigate to the applicable folder. 
 
 4. 
  Right-click the folder and click Always available offline. 
 
 5. 
 Wait while the process completes. 
 Manage Offline Files and Folders 
 Users might be concerned about how offline files work or what they need to do to make 
sure that there are no problems with versioning when working offline. You can assure 
your users that they’ll work with offline files just as they would any file. They navigate to it, 
open the file, do their work, and then save the changes. It’s possible to work offline even 
if you are connected to a network too, though, perhaps because the connection is slow or 
you know you’re going to encounter network issues while working. 
 To opt to work offline even if you are online in a Windows 10 workspace, keep in 
mind that this feature has been available for years and performing these steps with other 
operating system versions is similar:
 
 1. 
  Navigate to the file or folder. 
 
 2. 
 Click it one time to select it. 
 
 3. 
  From the toolbar under the Home tab, click Easy access.  
 Figure 3-7.  Choose the folders to configure as offline files 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
46
 
 4. 
 Click Work Offline. (If it says Work Online, you’re already 
working offline). See Figure  3-8 . 
 Figure 3-8.  You can opt to work with offline files even if you are connected to a network 
 
 5. 
 To sync files after you’re finished, right-click the file or folder 
and click Sync, then Sync selected offline files. (If there’s a 
conflict, you’ll be informed. More on this later.)     
 If you want to see all of your offline files, review their status, and see if there are any 
sync conflicts, open Sync Center. From here you can:
• 
 Browse to synced files 
• 
 Sync all files 
• 
 View and set up new sync partnerships 
• 
 View conflicts (older and newer versions of files) 
• 
 Manage synced files 
 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A SYNC CONFLICT?
 When you opt to enable offline files and folders and choose a folder to sync, a copy 
of that data is stored on your computer. You can work on those files there, and when 
you reconnect to the network, Windows starts the sync process automatically. When 
working online, sync is seamless. When working offline, Windows syncs when you 
reconnect. If you’ve made changes to the file on your computer and someone else 
has made changes to the original on the network drive Windows detects that conflict 
and prompts you regarding how you’d like to handle the situation. You can opt to 
create a second copy, or you can choose which of the two versions you’d like to keep.    
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
47
 Consider UE-V with Folder Redirection for Educational 
Institutions or Small Businesses 
 UE-V (User Experience Virtualization) technology lets users access their user profile from 
virtually anywhere. As noted earlier, a user profile holds the settings that a user configures 
on a computer, such as a screensaver, desktop background, and sound schemes, among 
other things. 
 Generally the user profile is stored on a user’s computer, such as a desktop or laptop. 
When Windows To Go is used independently of other solutions, the profile is stored on 
the USB drive. A user profile can also be stored in OneDrive, so that when a user logs on 
with his or her Microsoft account, the user profile is loaded. 
 UE-V with Folder Redirection and Offline Files is a common solution for all kinds of 
scenarios, though, and proves quite valuable for the end users as well as for the network 
administrators. In fact, it is the recommended method for providing access to data and 
settings with Windows To Go, because it delivers the best combination of flexibility and 
manageability for practically any infrastructure. 
 With UE-V, Folder Redirection, and Offline Files in place, your employees will always 
have a desktop they recognize, no matter where they log on. The consistency helps users 
feel comfortable right away, because the Windows To Go experience can be tailored to 
suit their needs. If they do have a desktop at work, the workspace can be configured to 
mimic that look too. 
 These three components are summarized here, as it relates to the network 
infrastructure:
• 
 UE-V can be used to synchronize users’ settings with a network 
file share. Changes made to Windows To Go settings while a user 
roams are synced with the file share when it becomes available. 
• 
  UE-V can sync application settings. Like users’ settings, changes 
made to application settings are synchronized with the file share 
when that share becomes available. 
• 
  Folder Redirection uses a file share too. Data is stored on the file 
share so that the user can access the data no matter where they 
log on. 
• 
  Offline Files copies configured files and folders to the Windows To 
Go workspace so that they are accessible even if the device isn’t 
connected to the network. Configuring Offline Files is essential if 
users are required to take their Windows To Go workspaces home 
with them, or are expected to work while using the Windows To 
Go drive. 
• 
 All of this works together. UE-V settings, application settings, and 
data are all stored to applicable redirected folders.    
 Of course, Windows To Go workspaces can be configured to redirect these settings 
and data to the cloud instead of network shares. OneDrive and Office 365 are just two 
solutions. Anyone can get OneDrive storage, so OneDrive is a viable solution for sole 
proprietors and small businesses. Users only need a Microsoft account to get started. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
48
 OneDrive can be used to store:
• 
 Data. 
• 
 Internet Explorer favorites. 
• 
 Desktop settings. 
• 
 Application settings. 
 Office 365 is another option. Office 365 offers cloud storage as well as a full version of 
Microsoft Office. While this solution can work for larger enterprises, it’s important to note 
that Office 365 offers educational institution plans for schools and institutions. Beyond 
that, there are free plans for students and faculty. While the options offered so far are 
common solutions, note that other solutions are available. SharePoint, GoogleDrive, and 
DropBox are just a few.

Administrators 
 So far I’ve introduced options for saving data off the Windows To Go drive for small 
businesses and sole proprietors. If you are a network administrator in a larger enterprise 
and you are interested in setting up folder redirection and offline files for your domain, 
that’s a different setup, and you have a lot of work to do before you can make that happen. 
While I can’t walk you through that entire process, I can guide you through the steps 
you’ll need to take to put the process into place. 
 Before we start, note that you’ll need to have administrator privileges. You can be 
a member of the Domain Administrators security group, the Enterprise Administrators 
security group, or the Group Policy Creator Owners security group. Client computers can 
run just about anything, including Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO

Windows Vista, and Windows XP. If you’re interested in using servers, Windows Server 
2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, 
or Windows Server 2003 are compatible. 
 All of the computers you want to manage need to be part of an Active Directory 
domain. Although it seems obvious perhaps, you’ll need to have a file server to start. 
That file server will hold the data for the folders you want to redirect. 
 
■ Note  Folder Redirection and Offline Files are not available for Windows RT. 
 Step 1: Create a Folder Redirection Security Group  
 You must create a group that contains users you want to apply folder redirection policy 
settings for. The way you do that varies depending on the Microsoft server version you 
are running. Because of this, these are fairly generic steps here to get you started, but I 
wanted to offer something to guide you through the process. So, if you don’t already have 
this process in place, here are some basic guidelines:
 
 1. 
  Open Server Manager. It must have Active Directory 
Administration Center installed. 
 
 2. 
  Click Tools, and click Active Directory Administration Center. 
 
 3. 
  Right-click the domain or OU (organizational unit), click New, 
and then opt to create a new group. 
 
 4. 
  Type a name for the group and make it a global group.  
 
 5. 
  Select the appropriate entities to add to the group. 
 
 6. 
  Type the names of the users or groups to which you want 
to deploy. 
 
 7. 
 Complete the process as applicable. 
 Step 2: Create a File Share for Redirected Folders  
 You need a file share on a server running Windows Server 2012. To create this share, and 
as was mentioned before these are fairly generic steps:
 
 1. 
 Click File and Storage Services from the Server Manager 
Navigation pane. 
 
 2. 
 Click Shares. 
 
 3. 
 Click Tasks. 
 
 4. 
 Click New Share. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
50
 
 5. 
 Using the wizard to complete the process: 
 a. 
  Click SMB Share - Quick if you have File Server Resource 
Manager installed. 
 b. 
 Click SMB-Share Advanced if you do not. 
 c. 
 Select the server where you want to create the share.  
 d. 
 Name the share. (You can put a $ after the name to hide 
the share.) 
 e. 
 Clear the Enable continuous availability checkbox, 
if applicable. If desired, select Enable access-based 
enumeration and Encrypt data access. 
 
 6. 
 Click Customize Permissions. 
 
 7. 
 Click Disable inheritance. Click Convert inherited 
permissions into explicit permission on this object. 
 
 8. 
 Set the permissions as follows, see Figure  3-9 :
  a. 
  SYSTEM – Full control for folders, subfolders, and files 
  b. 
  Administrators – Full control for this folder only  
  c. 
 CREATOR OWNER – Full control for subfolders and files 
  d. 
 Folder Redirection Users – List Folder/Read Data, Create 
Folders/Append Data this folder only 
 e. 
 Other groups – no permissions 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
51
 
 9. 
  Complete the wizard by setting the User Files folder usage 
value or the quota value, as applicable. 
 
 10. 
 Click Create. 
 Step 3: Create a GPO for Folder Redirection  
 If you do not already have a Group Policy Object (GPO) created for Folder Redirection 
settings, you’ll need to create one. You do this in Server Manager, from Tools, and Group 
Policy Management. You’ll create a new GPO, set the scope, and add the new security 
group. 
 Step 4: Configure and Enable Folder Redirection with 
Offline Files  
 Now, you’ll configure Group Policy. Here’s how:
 
 1. 
 In Group Policy Management, right-click the GPO you just created.  
 
 2. 
  Expand User Configuration, Policies, Windows Settings, and 
Folder Redirection. 
 
 3. 
  Right-click the folder to redirect and click Properties. 
 Figure 3-9.  Set security permissions 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ PREPARE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, SCHOOL, OR ENTERPRISE FOR WINDOWS TO GO
52
 
 4. 
  Click Basic – Redirect Everyone’s Folder To The Same Location.  
 
 5. 
 Click Create a folder for each user under the root path, and 
then in the Root Path box type the path to the file share. 
 
 6. 
 From the Settings tab, click Redirect the folder back to the 
local user profile location when the policy is removed.  
 
 7. 
 Click OK and then Yes. 
 
 8. 
 Now, from Group Policy Management, right-click the GPO 
you created and click Link Enabled. 
 
■ Note  Have users log on regularly to their Windows To Go drives to keep Active 
Directory (AD) computer account objects from becoming stale. 
 Considerations for DirectAccess 
 There’s one more issue I’d like to address before I close out this chapter. It has to do with 
how users can connect to your domain resources remotely. These are external users such 
as contractors or corporate users who need to access your network remotely. 
 We’ve talked about what has to be put into place with regard to storing data on 
domain servers, but how will users connect, exactly? One way is to use Windows 
2012 DirectAccess. With DirectAccess, client computers are always connected to your 
organization. You don’t have to worry about users initiating connections or closing 
connections, or even about connectivity problems. Additionally, IT administrators can 
manage DirectAccess client computers whenever they are running and connected to the 
Internet. 
 The following server operating systems support DirectAccess. You can deploy:
• 
 all versions of Windows Server® 2008 R2 as a DirectAccess client or 
a DirectAccess server. 
• 
 all versions of Windows Server® 2012 R2 as a DirectAccess client or 
a DirectAccess server. 
• 
 all versions of Windows Server® 2012 as a DirectAccess client or a 
DirectAccess server. 
 The following client operating systems support DirectAccess.
• 
 Windows 10® Enterprise 
• 
 Windows 10® Enterprise 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB)  
• 
 Windows® 8 Enterprise 
• 
 Windows® 7 Ultimate 
• 
 Windows® 7 Enterprise

 Summary 
 In this chapter you learned how to inventory your current enterprise network 
infrastructure to see how you can best utilize Windows To Go now, and what upgrades 
you’ll need to put into effect to provision Windows To Go drives if you want to do so with 
Windows 10. If you own a home or small business you learned how to use Windows To Go 
to roam effectively, exploring various storage options for users and their user profiles and 
data. In Chapter   4  you’ll learn about activation and volume licensing.

 CHAPTER 4  
 Understand Single 
Activations, Volume 
Licensing, and Software 
Assurance 
 Before you finalize a plan to create and provision Windows To Go drives in your enterprise, 
small business, or educational setting, you need to put a plan into place to activate them. 
There are several options, and you’ll want to compare those options to find out which one 
works best for you. Note that if you already have a volume license, you can use what you 
have in place. This chapter is for those who do not yet have an activation solution. 
 Activate a Single Windows To Go Workspace 
 The simplest activation option is the one that applies to single drives created for personal 
use. You have a copy of Windows Enterprise, you’ve purchased a compatible Windows To 
Go drive and you’ve installed an operating system on it using the Windows To Go Creator. 
These types of Windows To Go workspaces require an activation key just like any copy 
of Windows would. To input this key, boot to the Windows To Go drive, walk through 
the setup process just as you would with any Windows installation, and when prompted 
input the applicable product key. You’ll be required to activate the operating system too, 
once it’s up and running, just as you would with any OS. 
 You will see the prompt to activate in various ways, depending on the operating 
system installed. For instance, in Windows 8 and 8.1 you could be prompted when you 
open the Settings charm and try to make configuration changes. You might simply see a 
prompt that pops up in the bottom right corner of the screen, near the notification area. 
You can also navigate to the activation area manually. In Windows 8 or 8.1, go to the Start 
screen and type Activate Windows and select the appropriate result. With Windows 10, 
you can navigate to the options as shown in the steps that follow. Figure  4-1 shows an 
activated Windows installation and how to get there.  

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
56
 To activate Windows To Go for Windows 10:
 
 1. 
 Click Start. 
 
 2. 
 Click Settings. 
 
 3. 
 Click Update & Security. 
 
 4. 
 Click Activation. 
 
 5. 
 If applicable, enter a valid product key. 
 For any Windows to installation you can view the product key from the Control 
Panel, as shown in Figure  4-2 . You can change the key here should you need to, as well as 
in Settings shown in Figure  4-1 .

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
57
 What Is Volume Licensing? 
 It’s easy to manage the product ID codes associated with a handful of desktop computers 
in a small business. It’s equally easy to maintain those copies of Windows, reset or refresh 
computers when necessary, and even troubleshoot problems when they arise. Imagine 
though if you had, say, 250 computers to manage, or perhaps even thousands. Large 
businesses that have this kind of environment need a better way to manage their software 
and licenses, and that’s where volume licensing comes in. 
 Types of Programs 
 Microsoft Volume Licensing offers lots of licensing programs that businesses can choose 
from and Microsoft offers several web pages dedicated to choosing the ideal licensing 
option for specific scenarios. There are multiple solutions, and the right one depends 
on your company’s size and needs. The Volume Licensing solution is an online service. 
The nice thing about this type of solution is that when businesses acquire software and 
licenses through the program, there’s no need for physical disks or boxes of software 
to deal with. This, combined with purchasing licenses in volume, reduces the cost for 
acquiring the software too. 
 Most of the volume licensing programs that are available come with Software 
Assurance. This is an additional feature that provides support and maintenance for the 
software you purchase. Businesses with volume licenses and software assurance can 
access training and IT tools for administrators, and they have access to partner services 
and telephone support.

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
58
 The program you choose depends on several factors, and some thought should go 
into selecting a program. You’ll want to address the size of your organization first and 
foremost, but you’ll also need to consider what type of organization you have. There are 
many types from small business to large enterprises, as well as educational settings. 
 You’ll also need to consider what kind of software you’ll be acquiring licenses for. 
In this book we’re mainly focused on the Windows operating system and perhaps some 
Microsoft Office software, but there are lots of other pieces of software to consider. Some 
of those include server operating systems, cloud services, and so on. 
 Let’s look at three types of scenarios: small businesses, midsize and large businesses, 
and specialized organizations. 
 
■ Note   Once you’ve selected a program and signed up, you’ll use the Volume Licensing 
Service Center (VLSC) to download your products and product keys, and manage what 
you’ve purchased. You’ll learn more about that later. 
 Small Business 
 Small businesses that need five or more licenses, and these can include Windows To Go 
licenses, can select a version of the Open Value program that meets their needs. There 
are three options. Two of the three types of these programs include Software Assurance, 
detailed later in this chapter, and as mentioned already, they offer training and planning 
support, among other things. This program offers the lowest initial costs and makes it 
possible to add licenses one at a time if need be. One of the programs waives the five-PC 
minimum requirement, which makes it more affordable for very small businesses. Let's 
take a look at the three open license options. 
 Open License 
 This program is available for businesses that need to purchase five or more licenses 
initially, but the regular five licenses is waived in this program to meet the needs of 
startup companies and extremely small businesses. The Open License program allows 
businesses the option to add Software Assurance if desired, for an extra fee. 
 These licensing and assurance options apply to full packaged products and some 
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) software packages. Pricing is based on the 
product pools and not on desktop PCs. The agreement term is two years and business 
have no other option than to pay upfront, and unlike other options, this program option 
is not renewable. Online Services is offered, which is cloud service that offers productivity 
software such as Office 365 and Azure. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
59
 Open Value 
 Open Value has similar features as Open License but with a few changes. Software 
Assurance is included in the price, whereas in the previous program it was an add-on 
feature. There are no renewal options for OEM software, but renewals are available for 
licenses and Software Assurance. Unlike the previous program, the five-PC-minimum 
applies, although discounts are available for companies that apply the program to their 
entire organization. 
 This plan’s agreement is for three years and is renewable. Both Office 365 and 
other software are payable annually or upfront in full. As in all three Open plans, Online 
Services is available. 
 Open Value Subscription 
 This final subscription option for small businesses has all of the features of the Open 
Value program with a few minor changes. The agreement term is only one year for 
government and educational organizations, and payment is made annually; thus there is 
no requirement to pay upfront. 
 
■ Note   To buy or renew one of these program services in the United States, call (800) 
426-9400, or find an authorized reseller. In Canada, call the Microsoft Resource Centre at (877) 
568-2495. For other countries, visit the Microsoft Volume Licensing web site for your country.  
 Midsize and Large Businesses 
 There are more robust solutions for businesses that need more than 250 licenses, such 
as those found in midsize and large businesses. There are three areas to look at here: the 
Enterprise agreement, the Microsoft Products and Services agreement, and Select Plus. 
 Enterprise Agreement 
 The first of the additional volume licensing agreements to select from is the Enterprise 
agreement. When compared to buying software using traditional methods, buying in this 
manner can save a company anywhere from 15 to 45 percent initially. It’s a three-year 
agreement though, so that is certainly something to consider when selecting it; however, 
you can pay for it annually. You don’t have to pay for it all upfront. 
 With this package you subscribe to Microsoft products instead of owning them. You 
lease them, so to speak. The same is true of Microsoft services. One of the features of 
this program is that you can add or remove licenses annually, as the need arises for your 
particular environment. 
 There are two types of enrollments: Enterprise and Server and Cloud. Enterprise 
enrollment offers the best pricing if you’re looking to enroll users and devices. Server 
and Cloud enrollment offers the best pricing if you need to purchase server products and 
cloud technologies. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
60
 
■ Note   There is a new option for licensing Windows with regard to Software Assurance, 
with the emphasis on the user. With this option, all of a user’s devices are covered, even 
those running iOS or Android operating system. The only requirement for the user is that the 
user’s primary work PC has to be installed with a valid Windows operating system. 
 Microsoft Products and Services Agreement 
 The Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA) is a broader agreement that can 
be tailored to three types of organizations: commercial, government, and academic. You 
can obtain the greatest variety of Microsoft software and services through this type of 
agreement, and this, like others, includes licenses for Windows To Go drives. The MPSA is 
the best solution for organizations that want to buy cloud services but don’t want to have 
to buy a license for every person in their company. 
 Additionally, with this option companies can quickly provision cloud services such 
as Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Dynamics CRM Online, among other 
things. This agreement is flexible, and you can add users and services at any time. You 
can choose from one-, two-, and three-year agreement durations too. 
 
■ Note   Microsoft does not yet provide a specific document where all prices are listed for 
the MPSA offerings, but prices are provided based on servers, applications, and systems as 
applicable for a specific organization. 
 Select Plus 
 Select Plus is being retired and being replaced with MPSA. However, for companies that 
still have it, it’s available to renew through its next renewal date, starting July 1, 2016. This 
does not apply to government or academic Select Plus users.   
 Additional Information about Volume Licensing and 
Windows To Go 
 Windows To Go uses volume licensing activation, unless you’ve acquired an Enterprise 
edition of Windows and used the Windows To Go Creator to create a single Windows To 
Go workspace. In an enterprise you can either use Active Directory or Key Management 
Service (KMS) activation. See the note about KMS. No matter what you select, though, 
the Windows To Go drives count as a regular installation of Windows and apply to all 
licensing agreements. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
61
 
■ Note   KMS enables organizations to activate Windows systems using their own 
network. Individual computers don’t need to connect to Microsoft to activate when KMS 
is leveraged. KMS requires a specific number of physical or virtual computers in the 
company’s network environment, which are called minimums or activation thresholds. 
 If you add software to your Windows image, such as Microsoft Office, and distribute 
it to Windows To Go workspaces, those pieces of software must also be activated. The 
same is true of any third-party software you add to the image. Keep this in mind when 
creating the drive image; purchase licenses as needed. 
 
■ Caution    It’s important to note that Multiple Activation Key (MAK) activation isn’t 
supported with Windows To Go. It shouldn’t be used to activate Office or any other software 
on a Windows To Go drive either. 
 Software Assurance 
 You learned earlier that Software Assurance is an option for the Open License plan 
and included in other volume licensing programs. But what is Software Assurance? 
Software Assurance is a set of benefits that help you deploy, manage, and use the 
Microsoft products you own or lease efficiently, and this includes support and training for 
provisioning and using Windows To Go drives. With regard to Windows and Windows To 
Go, Software Assurance enables a large business to deliver Windows Enterprise editions 
across all kinds of devices from virtual machines to Windows To Go workstations. 
 With Software Assurance you’ll also have access to training for your administrators 
and users. And, of course, you'll have specific Windows and Windows To Go rights, which 
are discussed next. There are a lot of perks to having Software Assurance, certainly more 
than are applicable for discussion here, but let’s take a look at a few of these in depth as 
they might apply to Windows To Go. 
 Windows Version Rights 
 There are several types of rights associated with Windows and Windows versioning 
that come with Software Assurance. For one, every license that is covered is available to 
upgrade to a new version of Windows at no additional cost. You already learned that you 
can’t upgrade a Windows To Go workspace, though, but as it applies to creating those 
Windows To Go drives, having the ability to upgrade the Windows images you apply is 
applicable here. 
 Note that there’s no additional cost applied to upgrading Windows when Software 
Assurance is involved, as there would likely be with an upgrade using a familiar, 
packaged, off-the-shelf version of Windows. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
62
 There are also Virtual Desktop Access rights that enable users to use virtual versions 
of Windows in an assortment of situations. Of course, there are Windows To Go use 
rights too. Your employees can use Windows To Go on any device that is licensed under 
Software Assurance and Volume Licensing. 
 Additionally, because users roam, Roaming User Rights for Windows enables a 
user of any Software Assurance licensed device to access a virtual instance of Windows 
running in a data center. Users can leverage Windows To Go from noncorporate devices 
too, including their own PCs, public computers, and any other device that allows 
for booting to the workspace. Having this ability is central to using Windows To Go 
effectively, as you well know. 
 Technical and End-User Training 
 Software Assurance benefits include training for Windows software and services, cloud 
services, deployment and management, and more, from a benefit product catalogue 
available at the web site shown in Figure  4-3 . Training is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week for Software Assurance customers. 
 As you might imagine, there are lots of kinds of training available. You can get 
classroom training from a live instructor through your local Microsoft Learning Partner. 
The instructors are Microsoft Certified Trainers (MCT). These trainers have to undergo 
rigorous training themselves, as well as pass applicable tests to earn this certification and 
ultimately teach courses. 
 To find a learning partner, visit the web site shown in Figure  4-4 , type your criteria, 
and click Search. 
 Figure 4-3.  Access Software Assurance training 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
63
 With regard to classroom training, users enroll for training using training vouchers. 
Eligible courses are those that are deemed Microsoft Official Courseware (designed for IT 
professionals or developers) and do not include training for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint 
or hands-on labs, first-look clinics, or Microsoft Press books. 
 
■ Note   You must access training vouchers before your Software Assurance coverage 
expires. The voucher remains valid for 180 days after the date you acquired it, and it needs 
to be used within that time frame. 
 Users can also access training with self-paced training delivered over the Internet, 
or if applicable, over a company's own intranet. This is called e-Learning. Because the 
training is available from Microsoft via Software Assurance, training won’t impact a 
company’s budget. There are as many options for e-learning as there are users with 
Software Assurance licenses, and those users can access training for the product they use 
(such as Windows 10 Enterprise).

 How to Use the Volume Licensing Service Center 
 One you’ve acquired the desired level of volume licensing, with or without Software 
Assurance, you manage those licenses from the VLSC, shown in Figure  4-5 . You can also 
download software here, view the details of your account, and even grant permissions. 
 To use the VLSC you must first sign in. You can see the sign-in link in Figure  4-5 . 
Once you’re in, you’ll see various tabs across the top including but not limited to Home, 
Licenses, Downloads and Keys, Software Assurance, Administration, and Help. 
 Figure  4-6  shows the Home tab. As you can see, there are quick links to software 
downloads and keys, online activation, and license summary, and a link to add an open 
license, as applicable.  
 Figure 4-5.  Use the Volume Licensing Service Center to manage volume licenses 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ UNDERSTAND SINGLE ACTIVATIONS, VOLUME LICENSING, AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
65
 
■ Note   Microsoft will require both a Windows Live ID and a valid business e-mail address 
to ensure secure access to licensing data. 
 Here are a few other quick tips for using this portal:
• 
 Use the Licenses tab to view license versions and quantities. 
• 
  From the Downloads and Keys page, you can access your 
products. 
• 
  From the Software Assurance page, review your benefits.  
• 
  From the subscriptions page access MSDN or TechNet 
subscriptions, among other things. 
• 
 From the Help tab access help. 
 Summary 
 To use Windows To Go in an enterprise you’ll need to manage the licenses for it using 
the same techniques you use to manage regular Windows licenses. You do this through 
volume licensing. There are many licensing programs to choose from, and you’ll choose 
the one that is right for you based on the size of your company and type of organization. 
Once signed up you’ll use the VLSC to manage licenses as well as any Software Assurance 
benefits you own. In Chapter   5 you’ll learn how to deploy Windows To Go drives.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Deploy Windows To Go Drives  
 So far you’ve learned about provisioning single Windows To Go drives for exploration and 
single-use scenarios, you’ve looked at the requirements for creating and offering those 
drives in a small to medium-sized business, and you’ve explored a little about how it all 
works in an enterprise, including some steps to take on your servers to start the planning 
and prepping process. In this chapter you’ll learn more about how it all works in an 
enterprise, including what needs to be considered and how to actually create the images 
you’ll use once you have all of the pieces in place. 
 You might use a Windows Deployment Services server to do this. You might opt to 
automate the process for self-provisioning using System Center. Or, you might use what 
you already have in place to create and modify images, such DISM, and then deploy those 
images using PowerShell. There are lots of ways to go, and I suggest looking at what’s 
already in place in your enterprise before you commit to any one solution. 
 That said, you likely won’t put what’s required to create, capture, and deploy drives 
in place just to create 20 or 30 Windows To Go drives. You could create each manually 
using other options, including third-party cloning tools. It’s far more likely you already 
have a process for creating and managing Windows images, and you need to add this 
to your existing Windows program. With that in mind, then, know that I won’t walk you 
through the entire process here, from start to finish. That’s a book all in itself. However, 
I can guide you through the general steps you’ll need to navigate to get from where you 
are now to provisioning Windows To Go drives in your enterprise, giving you lots of 
options in the process. 
 
■ Note   Before we dive in, make sure you understand that in an enterprise you capture 
and create the images that you’ll use on Windows To Go drives the same way you capture 
and create regular Windows images for your laptops and desktops. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
68
 Considerations for Deployment 
 The initial need for Windows To Go came about as users in medium- to large-sized 
businesses started to become more mobile, both in the field and in the office. There 
needed to be a solution to let these users work even when a computer wasn’t available. 
As this need expanded and technologies started forming around these new scenarios, 
enterprises embraced Windows To Go as a valid option for solving some of their mobile 
problems. What they wanted and needed, though, was for their users to have the same 
experience on their Windows To Go drives as they would have if they were actually sitting 
at a corporate machine, at a desk, in a cubicle, doing traditional work. This had to be part 
of the solution. 
 Thus, from the onset, Microsoft created Windows To Go to mimic a user’s corporate 
desktop experience. Microsoft wanted to make the drives easy to provision too, and 
to allow companies to use the infrastructure already in place to minimize additional 
costs or training. To make this happen, Windows To Go drives had to be able to be both 
compatible with existing deployment workflows and have the ability take on corporate 
Windows images that had already been created by corporations. Of course, limiting cost 
is a factor too, and thus Windows To Go drives had to be both available and affordable. 
Compatible drives are inexpensive, adding to the Windows To Go solution. 
 In this part of the chapter I’ll offer information about some things to consider as you 
get ready for your capture and deployment tasks. Let’s start with some basics of using 
Windows images.  
 Windows Images 
 As noted, if you’re in an enterprise environment, you likely already have a plan in place 
to create and modify your own custom Windows images. Before you start the process 
though, let’s take at the requirements to make sure you have met them. The process will 
go a lot more smoothly if you don’t have to stop and put something new into place. 
 If you’re planning on performing these tasks with Microsoft products using an in-
house workflow, you need, among other things:
• 
 An existing deployment infrastructure that includes 
administrative rights to the computers and servers you’ll use 
to create and manage images, the Windows Application and 
Deployment Toolkit (ADK), and a Windows Preinstallation 
Environment (Windows PE) disk. 
• 
 System Center 2012 Configuration Manager SP1 or later to enable 
users to self-provision Windows To Go drives. 
• 
 Blank USB drives that are Windows To Go compatible and are at 
least 32 GB. 
• 
 A basic or custom .WIM or .iso image. 
• 
 Applicable device drivers. 
• 
 A way to copy the image to the physical Windows To Go device, 
which can include USB ports, USB duplicators, and so on. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES

 Once you’ve created the image, and you’ll learn how in this chapter, you can 
duplicate that image as many times as you like, provided you select an applicable type of 
image. Image types are outlined in the section Leverage Existing Infrastructure later in 
this chapter. Note that although images are reusable from the creator standpoint, once 
an image is deployed to a specific USB drive, that image is “used up.” You can’t reuse that 
image again; you’ll always use the original Windows image you create employing the 
tools outlined in this chapter. 
 
■ Note   If you use a USB drive duplicator to duplicate Windows To Go drives, do not 
configure offline domain join or BitLocker on the Windows To Go drive image. 
 Driver Considerations 
 A device driver is a piece of software that lets software talk to hardware. In the case of 
Windows To Go, you need the applicable device drivers to allow the Windows To Go 
device to communicate with the host computer. Because there are so many different 
computer manufacturers and hardware combinations, though, some thought needs to 
go into adding the required drivers to the Windows To Go images you create. As you’d 
suspect, you add those drivers prior to deployment and during image creation. 
 You might know that Windows includes a driver store that holds device drivers 
that can support a variety of computers and peripherals already. When you connect a 
computer to a new piece of hardware such as a printer, or when you boot a Windows 
To Go drive with a computer you’ve never booted to before, drivers are automatically 
loaded for all of the new devices it discovers. The drivers available in the default Driver 
Store that comes with Windows might work just fine. Most of the time the files required 
by computers and Windows To Go are in this repository. However, if they aren’t, 
Windows will look to Windows Update, again providing a safety net should you not 
include everything you need. This is true for both external and internal devices. In both 
Windows and Windows To Go, the driver store is located under  \Windows\System32\
DriverStore\File Repository  as shown in Figure  5-1 . 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
70
 With regard to images you create for Windows To Go drives, you’ll want to add any 
images to Windows that aren’t included here that you think you might need. For instance, 
if you know you’ll be using the Windows To Go workspaces on a specific set of computers 
that has specialty hardware not normally found inside a computer tower, you can 
incorporate the drivers for those computers into the image you create. 
 You should make a special effort to also add any network-related drivers too, 
including Wi-Fi drivers. It’s very important that Windows To Go drives be able to connect 
to the Internet through their host. They need access to Windows Update as well as to your 
corporate domain, they need access to the Internet to activate successfully on first use, 
and so on. 
 Domain Join 
 You will either deploy the Windows To Go drives to users while they are on company 
property (at work) or you will give a Windows To Go drives to users to set up when they 
are away from the office. However you decide to do it, the user needs some way to join 
the domain, and this needs to be set up beforehand as part of the image you create. How 
the user joins this domain varies, but there are a few options you should consider and put 
into practice prior to actually handing over a drive to a user. 
 At work, joining a domain is generally achieved the same way it is when a laptop or 
desktop is provisioned to a new user. The user with the Windows To Go drive first works 
through any setup processes and then connects to the enterprise network. Generally, a 
user receives an IP (Internet Protocol) address via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol). Once connected, the user’s group policies are applied (at least those that aren’t 
 Figure 5-1.  The Driver Store is included in all Windows images 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES

included in the image), BitLocker keys are stored in the applicable Active Directory Domain 
Services area, and the user is connected to network resources. If there’s anything else that 
needs to happen, like getting software, accessing online applications, updating the software 
installed, and accessing personal data online or in the domain, it happens after this. 
 If you plan to deploy a Windows To Go drive to a user who isn’t going to be at work 
when he or she initializes the drive, you’ll need to make sure that you configure offline 
domain join and BitLocker. You’ll also need to consider how the user will actually connect, 
perhaps via a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or DirectAccess. This and other initialization 
tasks should be considered and incorporated before giving the drive to the user. 
 
■ Note   To learn more about Remote Access options review the document   Deploy Remote 
Access in an Enterprise, available at TechNet  . 
 Install Applications 
 If you have an infrastructure in place that you can use to create unattended Windows 
installations, you can create your Windows To Go drives so that end users don’t have 
to do much of anything the first time they use them. With Windows To Go there is 
something similar called self-provisioning, which is detailed later in this chapter in 
the section titled Use System Center. However, most enterprises don’t have this type of 
infrastructure, so the first time a user initializes a drive he or she will have a bit of work 
to do. This can include more than just working through a short setup process and joining 
the domain. It can also include installing applications or, at least, updating them. 
 Figure  5-2 shows a prompt a user might receive after booting Windows To Go the first 
time. It states that updates are available. This is a common prompt so you’ll want to train 
your users appropriately before you hand over a drive. As with any Windows deployment, 
you’ll have to put a plan in place to incorporate installations or updates. If possible it’s 
best to put the updates into the image prior to creating the drives.  
 Figure 5-2.  A user might be prompted to perform his or her own updates 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
72
 If users need to get something at the Windows Store, it’s certainly possible with 
Windows 8.1 and 10. There are limitations on the store for Windows 8, as noted in 
Chapter   1 . You’ll need to teach users how to do that, and, you’ll need to allow them to 
get to the store. So, you’ll want to enable the Windows Store during the image creation 
process; if you don’t know, it’s disabled by default. You can enable this in your domain 
Group Policy or in Local Group Policy. 
 Here’s how to enable the Store using a Local Group Policy editor:
 
 1. 
 Use the Windows +R key to open a Run box. 
 
 2. 
 Type gpedit.msc and hit Enter on the keyboard. 
 
 3. 
 Navigate to  Computer Configuration\Administrative 
templates\Windows Components\Store. 
 
 4. 
 Double click “ Allow Store to install apps on Windows To Go 
workspaces ” policy. 
 
 5. 
 Click Enable. 
 
 6. 
 Click Apply, then OK. 
 
 7. 
 Click the Windows key + R to open a Run dialog box. 
 
 8. 
 Type CMD and press Enter. 
 
 9. 
 Type  gpupdate/force and click Enter to apply the changes 
immediately. See Figure  5-3 . 
 Figure 5-3.    Apply the new policy immediately using the  gpudpate /force  command; if you 
don’t, the policy won’t be applied until Group Policy updates again on its own 
 
 10. 
 Close the command prompt window. 
 Finally, although you might host applications on site and let users access 
applications remotely, they could instead be in charge of working through an installation 
process themselves from a startup script or through the actual application. Figure  5-4 
shows a prompt users could see after installing and then updating Microsoft Office.  
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
73
 However you opt to get software to users, make sure to train them in installation 
and update procedures. Make as much of it as possible user-friendly too. In a best-case 
scenario users would not need to install anything, but this isn’t often possible.   
 Apply Group Policy 
 You already applied Group Policies to your domain enterprise users, and you can apply 
the same policies to your Windows To Go users. You learned about this in Chapter   3 . 
However, there are a few policy settings that are Windows To Go-specific. Although we 
touched on these in an earlier chapter, let’s take one more look to refresh your memory, 
and look at them in a little more depth. 
 The specific Windows To Go Group Policy settings are located at  \\Computer 
Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Portable Operating 
System\  in the Local Group Policy Editor. See Figure  5-5 . 
 Figure 5-4.  Users might need to work through an update process

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
74
 Allow Hibernate (S4) When Started from a Windows To Go 
workspace 
 This policy setting specifies whether the PC can use the hibernation sleep state (S4) when 
started from a Windows To Go workspace. By default, hibernation is disabled when using 
a Windows To Go workspace because when a computer enters hibernation, the contents 
of memory are written to disk. When the disk is resumed, the hardware must still be 
available to provide the information to the operating system. Oftentimes, the Windows 
To Go drive would not be booted to the same host it would have hibernated to; this 
would ultimately cause a loss of data. Also, the Windows To Go drive would have to be 
connected to the same USB port it was connected to when it went into hibernation. Even 
if the same host is used, it is possible that a different USB port would be used, and that 
would imply that the Windows To Go drive had been removed anyway, and reinserted. All 
of this would cause data loss if the drive were configured to go into hibernation on a host. 
 For these reasons and others, hibernation is not recommended for Windows To Go 
drives. Hibernation should only be used when you are positive that the Windows To Go 
workspace is always used on the same PC and does not roam. 
 Disallow Standby Sleep States (S1-S3) When Starting from a 
Windows To Go Workspace 
 This policy setting specifies whether the PC can use standby sleep states (S1–S3) when 
started from a Windows To Go workspace. The sleep state is not enabled by default, 
because when a computer goes to sleep, it appears as though the computer and Windows 
To Go are both shut down. A user might think that both were shut down properly, when 
in reality they were not. Because shutting down a Windows To Go drive incorrectly by 
removing it before it has been properly shut down can harm or corrupt the drive, it’s best 
to leave this feature disabled. 
 Windows To Go Default Startup Options 
 This policy setting controls whether the host computer will boot to Windows To Go if 
a USB a Windows To Go drive is connected. It also controls whether users can make 
changes to the Windows To Go Startup Options settings dialog. Note that if you enable 
this setting it will cause PCs running Windows to attempt to boot from any USB device 
that is inserted into the PC before it is started, not just Windows To Go devices. 
 Bios and Firmware 
 Speaking of host computers and Windows To Go startup options, you learned earlier, 
and it makes sense, that the biggest problem users have with Windows To Go is the 
boot process. That process depends on the type of machine, its configuration, how its 
BIOS and boot order are configured, and so on. If a computer hasn’t previously been 
configured to boot to Windows To Go a user might attempt to enter the BIOS options 
himself to change it. This could result in many types of failures, including making the host 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
75
computer completely unbootable. Because of this it’s necessary that you try very hard 
to reduce the number of situations during boot that users might experience and try to 
fix themselves. With that in mind you should always enable the Windows To Go startup 
options to allow for Windows To Go boot-ups beforehand. With this done there’s no need 
to worry about firmware or BIOS or users trying to configure these options themselves. 
 You learned how to perform this task in Chapter   1  and you can enable it in Group 
Policy as outlined previously. Figure  5-6 shows the dialog box for making the change on a 
single PC using the graphical end-user interface. 
 Figure 5-6.    Configure Windows To Go startup options on a Windows 10 computer 
 Regarding firmware, Windows supports two types: Unified Extensible Firmware 
Interface (UEFI) and legacy BIOS firmware. BIOS was used frequently with Windows 7 
PCs and earlier, and most Windows 8 and windows 10 PCs use UEFI. Windows To Go 
supports both, and when you create a Windows To Go drive using the Windows To Go 
Creator or using any existing infrastructure for applying images in an enterprise, that 
support is built in. However, if you are planning to use Windows To Go drives manually 
you must use the ALL parameter to provide the Windows To Go drive the ability to boot 
on both types of firmware. For example, on volume F: (your Windows To Go USB drive 
letter), you would use the command  bcdboot C:\windows /s F: /f ALL . 
 Enable BitLocker 
 You know about BitLocker and how it protects the Windows To Go drive. You’ll want to 
enable BitLocker on your drives to protect them. You can choose to enable BitLocker 
protection on Windows To Go drives beforehand as part of the provisioning process, 
which ensures the process completes successfully and enables for a faster encryption 
process, or you can allow your end users to apply BitLocker protection themselves, 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
76
during their own initialization processes. If you opt to apply BitLocker beforehand, you’ll 
need some way to get that BitLocker password to the user and tell him to change his 
password immediately at first use. 
 You’ll also need a plan in place to store and recover BitLocker recovery keys. These 
keys can unlock the drive when the user forgets the passcode or some other problem 
arises. You should back up these keys to Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), 
although you can have users store keys in the cloud, on a USB drive, or on a network 
drive. They’ll be prompted to do so during the creation. 
 There are also a few Group Policy settings to consider prior to making decisions 
about BitLocker, which I’ll detail next. 
 \Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating 
System Drives\Require Additional Authentication at Startup 
 You have to enable this policy if the computer does not have a TPM chip, which USB 
drives do not. You must enable this setting and select Allow BitLocker without a 
compatible TPM check box and then enable the Configure use of passwords for operating 
system drives setting. See Figure  5-7 . 
 Figure 5-7.  Enable the option to allow BitLocker without a TPM 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
77
 \Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating 
System Drives\Configure Use of Passwords for Operating 
System Drives 
 This policy setting enables passwords to be used to unlock BitLocker-protected operating 
system drives. See Figure  5-8 . You can also configure complexity and length requirements 
on passwords for Windows To Go workspaces. If you enable these settings you should 
also enable the Group Policy setting “Password must meet complexity requirements” 
located in  Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account 
Policies\Password Policy\ .

 This policy setting allows users to enable authentication options that require user input 
from the preboot environment even if the drive doesn’t provide preboot input capability. 
You must enable this setting if you want passwords to be used to unlock BitLocker-
protected operating system drives. See Figure  5-9 .

 Deploy Windows To Go with PowerShell 
 If you only need to create a few Windows To Go drives you can use the Windows To Go 
creator to create them one at a time. If you have say, 100 drives to create and already 
have a workflow and infrastructure in place for creating Windows images, you can us that 
workflow to create the drives. If the latter is the case, there’s no need for me to rehash 
what you already have and know, especially if you already have an IT department that’s 
knowledgeable about such things. However, if you’re looking for something new or you 
are just getting going with Windows To Go, you might be interested in creating drives 
using PowerShell scripts. That’s what I’d like to talk about here. 
 
■ Note   PowerShell administrators generally deploy Windows To Go to multiple devices 
using the technique outlined here. 
 As you might imagine, it would be difficult for me to create and type a script here that 
could be applied to scenarios to create drives and deploy them that work for all readers, 
but lucky for us, Microsoft offers sample deployment scripts free of change at its TechNet 
web site. To see this script and information about how to use it, locate the web page 
shown in Figure  5-10 . You can find it by searching for Deploy Windows To Go, Technet, 
from any web browser. 
 Figure 5-10.    Use the sample deployment scripts available from TechNet to deploy 
Windows To Go 
 Once at the page, scroll down to the Advanced Deployment Sample Scripts area. 
Note that although this webpage applies to Windows 8, you can adapt it to work for 
Windows 10 and your environment where applicable. You learned in the last chapter 
what needs to be updated in any infrastructure to create Windows To Go drives, so if you 
have any questions return there before copying the scripts here. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
80
 From the sample script area you can locate and copy a script to use in PowerShell 
to provision multiple Windows To Go drives and to also configure offline domain join. 
Before you start to use this script, note these requirements:
• 
 From a domain-joined computer, open a Windows PowerShell 
session as an administrator. 
• 
 The administrator account you use must have permission to 
create domain accounts. 
• 
 You can only provision half as many drives as you have drive 
letters, which is a limitation of the sample script you’re learning 
about here. 
• 
 If you are using DirectAccess you’ll need to modify the djoin.
exe command to include policy names and potentially the 
certtemplate parameters. 
 To run the advanced deployment sample script:
 
 1. 
 From this   web page  , locate and then copy the entire the code 
sample titled “Windows To Go multiple drive provisioning 
sample script” into a PowerShell script (.ps1) file. 
 
 2. 
  Paste the file into Notepad or something similar. 
 
 3. 
  Make the required modifications to make it an appropriate 
script for your deployment and save the file. 
 
 4. 
  From an elevated PowerShell prompt type Set-
ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned. 
 
 5. 
 Run the script. 
 During this process, the PowerShell script will try to detect the drives that are 
connected to the machine you’re working on, specifically USB drives that can be 
provisioned with Windows To Go that are larger than 20 GB. (As with other parameters, 
you can modify this number before running the script.) After that you’ll verify that you 
want to clear the contents of these drives, which means any existing data will be removed. 
There will be two partitions created to support both UEFI and BIOS host machines during 
this process and all soon-to-be Windows To Go drives will be formatted. 
 During the process as outlined in this script, BitLocker encryption will be applied 
and unique recovery keys will be created. You’ll need to decide where to store those keys, 
and Active Directory is the best option; however, you can use other options. Whatever the 
case, you’ll need to copy the key during this process. BitLocker applied in this manner 
is a great way to go because only the used space on the drive is encrypted during this 
process, which makes the process go a lot faster. As data is added by the user, that data 
will subsequently be encrypted as well. 
 Now you’ll apply your image. You’ll need to select the enterprise image that you want 
to use for Windows To Go. You might need to change the Index entry here. You do this by 
modifying the provided DISM command. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
81
 Finally, you’ll add the boot files. If you want to roam with the drive you’ll want to put 
all available files there. If you want to, you can now append other files like unattend files, 
additional policy files, and so forth. 
 Note that you can get more information about this sample script and locate others on 
TechNet, MSDN, and other Microsoft-supported areas of the Web. There are third-party 
scripts available too, and often you can reach out to the manufacturers of your Windows 
To Go compatible drives for help as well. 
 Leverage Existing Infrastructure 
 In this section I’ll go over a few items related to existing infrastructure. You know already 
that Windows To Go makes it possible to use existing infrastructure to work with these 
workspaces. So, in this part of the chapter I’ll talk a little about the types of images you 
might already have and want to work with, including disk, sector, file, and Windows 
Image Format files. I’ll include information about how those files come to be, and their 
advantages and disadvantages. The idea here is that if you have existing infrastructure in 
place, you can use it with Windows To Go. 
 Types of Images 
 If you already have images available to you that you’d like to use on Windows To Go 
drives, you can certainly opt to use them. However, if you think you might want to 
consider other options, there are four types of images to contemplate: disk images, sector-
based images, file-based images, and Windows Imaging Format (WIM) images. 
 Disk and Sector-Based Images 
 A disk image is a single file that contains an entire disk structure and thus includes a lot 
more data than just a single copy of Windows. It can also include applications, drivers, 
Windows updates, software updates, and even settings like desktop backgrounds and 
screensavers. The image is generally created in enterprises by installing Windows on a 
reference computer, configuring it to one’s liking, and then making a copy of the disk. 
This image is then saved to a network location as a complete installation package that can 
be used to install computers. 
 Disk images can be used to create VHDs. These images can also be burned to a CD 
or DVD. They can also be used as system backups and data recovery (if created in the 
appropriate manner). Because the disk image is a copy of an entire disk, though, the file can 
be quite large. You can see an example of a disk image file in Figure  5-11 .  

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
82
 Here I’ve navigated to the Downloads folder and am viewing by Details. This figure 
also shows the properties sheet for a Windows 10 disk image file, and note that this one 
has an .iso extension. 
 ISO images are sector-based. When you use a sector-based image to deploy Windows 
you have to take care to remove the original computer name and the security identifier 
(SID). These two items uniquely identify the computer on which is was created. Sector-
based images can be a bad choice if you want to use the image on computers with varying 
hardware that might conflict with the image created, unless you have an option available 
to remove this information. 
 File-Based Disk Images and WIM 
 A file-based image is one that is captured based on actual files on a disk and is thus not 
a complete copy of the disk itself. These images are not based on any sort of hardware; 
they are only based on actual files. Thus, they are hardware-independent and can be 
deployed to almost any Windows-compatible computer hardware. This is also a single file 
  Figure 5-11.  A disk image file is often quite large 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
83
like a sector-based file, and it remains intact after use, so it can be used over and over and 
deployed to hundreds of computers. 
 File-based images are often created as WIM files. You used to use ImageX, part of the 
Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK) and the ADK, to create WIM files. ImageX 
has been deprecated now though, and has been replaced with DISM. Administrators use 
DISM to install, uninstall, configure, modify, and update Windows features, packages, 
drivers, and so on in an existing .wim file or VHD. To make these modifications they use 
the available DISM servicing commands, some of which are detailed in the section titled 
Manually Capture the Image with DISM later in this chapter. DISM was introduced in 
Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2. 
 WIM files offer the following advantages over other file formats as they relates to 
enterprises and Windows To Go:
• 
  You can include multiple images. 
• 
  You can compress the file. 
• 
  The components of the file are hardware independent. 
• 
  The file supports offline servicing (you can open a .WIM file and 
add or remove folders, files, drivers, and so on).  
• 
 You can use DISM to modify the file. 
 Capture Images 
 To create an image that you can use to deploy to Windows To Go devices you must 
first configure an image. To do this, you create a reference computer that incorporates 
everything you want to include with the image. It should contain the operating system, 
of course, but it might also contain applications and drivers. It can also contain specific 
settings and even policies you want applied on first use. 
 Once the computer is set up exactly as you want it, you use the Sysprep command-
line tool to prepare it for cloning. Sysprep is outlined next. 
 Use Sysprep.exe 
 Sysprep prepares a computer for imaging by removing unique identifiers from the image 
before creation. You have to do this to be able to reuse that image on different computers. 
Specifically it’s the  sysprep /generalize  command that removes this information, which 
is data that is on the computer that is specific to the reference computer’s installation like 
the security indentifier, system restore points, event logs, and so on. This is a required 
step in preparing the Windows installation so that it can be successfully imaged. After 
applying this command with other applicable parameters, on reboot, a new security 
identifier is created, activation is reset, and other tasks are performed. 
 The sysprep.exe command has other parameters beyond /Generalize though. They 
are shown in Table 5-1. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
84
 
■ Note  A Sysprep command might look like this:  sysprep.exe [ /oobe |  /audit ] 
[ /generalize ] [ /reboot |  /shutdown |  /quit ] [ /quiet ] [ /unattend: answerfile ]. 
 Manually Capture the Image with DISM 
 After you’ve run the Sysprep command you are ready to capture the image. You can do 
that with DISM (among other ways), which is available in the Windows ADK. You’ll need 
a Windows PE disk, which you can create with the Windows ADK as well. 
 To create a Windows PE disk:
 
 1. 
 Open the  Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment as 
an  administrator . See Figure  5-12 . 
 Table 5-1.  Sysprep.exe Parameters 
 Command 
 Description 
 /audit 
 Lets you add additional drivers or applications to Windows. 
 /OOBE 
 Restarts the computer in Windows Welcome mode to let users 
customize their own OS with user names and other settings. 
 /Reboot 
 Restarts the computer to ensure everything works properly. 
 /Shutdown 
 Shuts down the computer after Sysprep completes. 
 /Quiet 
 Use if you automate Sysprep; it stops any display of messages and 
confirmations. 
 /Quit 
 Closes Sysprep after running commands. 
 /Unattend 
 Applies settings specified in an answer file, if one is created. You must 
specify the path.

 With the PE disk created, you can now work through the following steps, which are 
detailed broadly:
 
 1. 
  Put the Windows PE disk in the applicable drive or port.  
 
 2. 
  Restart the computer and boot to the Windows PE disk.

  Use DISM to capture the system partition, if it’s been 
customized. Note the DISM command listed below.

WHAT IS WINDOWS PE?
 Windows PE is a Windows operating system with limited capabilities that was 
originally developed to help original equipment manufacturers boot machines that 
had no functioning operating system. It can also be used to prepare a computer for 
Windows installation. It can be used to copy disk images from a network share or 
mapped network drive, or a file service. It can also be used to initiate Windows Setup. 
 Windows PE is not to be used as the primary operating system on a computer, and it 
has built-in limitations to prevent that—including limited resources and a scheduled 
reboot after a specific amount of time has passed. It can also be used to initiate the 
Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE). 
 There are several commands you’ll need to become familiar with to use DISM 
effectively. Some of the commands include:
• 
 DISM /Capture-Image — with applicable parameters that name 
the image file and location for all applicable partitions. 
• 
 DISM /Capture-Image — with applicable parameters that specify 
the location of the configuration file, whether to compress the file, 
to make a volume image a bootable image, to check for errors, 
and so on. 
• 
 Net Use — to create a network share to store the image and to 
access that image later. 
• 
 Copy — to copy the image files to the network share. 
 With the image created, you are now ready to deploy. You can use your existing 
infrastructure to do that, if you already have a plan and workflow in place. You can deploy 
with PowerShell, detailed earlier, and you can use System Center, detailed next, if your 
enterprise supports this technology. 
 Use System Center 
 You can let users self-provision their own Windows To Go drives if you have access 
to System Center. Using this technology, administrators can create task sequences to 
support automating Windows To Go deployments and allow those deployments to 
be initiated by end users. You do this by prestaging the media using System Center’s 
Configuration Manager. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
87
 In broad terms, the process goes like this:
 
 1. 
  An administrator sets up System Center Configuration 
Manager to create the content for the deployment package.  
 
 2. 
  The Configuration Manager offers a wizard to assist in the 
process. The wizard helps you create a deployment package 
that contains the operating system package, boot images to 
support all architectures, applications, drivers, and so on. 
 
 3. 
  The package can contain a BitLocker pin, BitLocker 
requirements, BitLocker policies, and so on. 
 
 4. 
  The wizard assists in naming a place where recovery keys will 
be stored. 
 
 5. 
  The wizard helps you to name a distribution point to hold the 
completed package. 
 
 6. 
  Toward the end of the wizard you are prompted to add device 
drivers as applicable. 
 
 7. 
  The wizard lets you point to any answer files you’ve created to 
further automate the process and require as little from the end 
user as possible. 
 
 8. 
  Finally, the wizard helps you create the prestaged WIM file 
and also attach the Creator tool. All of this is collected in a 
single source directory. 
 With the entire package available in an online store or application portal as 
applicable to your enterprise, users now visit the specified area to create their own 
Windows To Go drives. They insert the drive into their own computer, navigate to the 
store, and click Install, and the Windows To Go Creator starts. It looks like the Windows 
To Go Creator you’ve already seen, and users only need to work through a few clicks to 
create a drive. If you’ve forgotten what that tool looks like, it’s shown in Figure  5-13 . 
 Figure 5-13.  The Windows To Go Creator 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ DEPLOY WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
88
 It’s not a simple process to get System Center and an application portal up and 
running, though, so you won’t want to do that unless you have good reason to. Use this 
option only if you want to let users self-provision their own Windows To Go drives and 
you have additional uses for it. 
 Summary 
 After all of the planning, considerations, and purchasing to get to a place to create 
Windows To Go drives, you can then choose exactly how you want to do it. You can use 
existing technologies and infrastructures already in place to leverage what you already 
own and use. You can use basic Windows images and provision drives using PowerShell. 
You can even use something like System Center Configuration Manager to allow users to 
self-provision their own drives. In Chapter   6 you’ll learn how to secure the Windows To 
Go drives you create.

 CHAPTER 6  
 Secure and Protect Windows 
To Go Drives 
 You’ve learned a lot thus far about creating and deploying Windows To Go drives, and 
you’ve learned about using BitLocker, but I haven’t talked at length about any other 
security-related topics. In this chapter that’s what I’ll cover. Although some of this will be 
highly technical, it’s important to understand the underlying technologies that go into 
protecting and securing data. You need to be aware of what’s available and how those 
technologies can be used in your network to protect users’ data and transmissions, and 
you need to have at least a basic understanding of the options available. 
 Because one part of securing and protecting Windows To Go drives deals with 
protecting the data that is created by users who employ those drives, I’ll start off the 
chapter with additional options for managing the data users create, and data you’d like 
them to have access to. You'll learn about some storage options and server roles you can 
add to assist. Following that, I’ll cover more about BitLocker, including how to manage 
recovery keys. Additionally, there are a few more technical items to discuss, such as 
combining DirectAccess with Domain Join and what's required in an enterprise to use 
the technologies together. Finally, I’ll address the various VPN protocols and what those 
protocols provide in the way of secure, VPN connectivity for your Windows To Go clients. 
 
■ Note  Remember that one of the biggest concerns for businesses is when users bring 
their own devices to work. Make sure to address any issues that are likely to arise in your 
organization preemptively. 
 File and Storage Options and Services 
 You know not to save data to a Windows To Go drive and you know to encourage others 
not to either. Data should always be saved off the drive, preferably to a domain server, 
perhaps using a technique like folder redirection or offline files, or using a cloud option 
like OneDrive, a hosted SharePoint site, or even GoogleDrive. I discussed these few of 
these options in earlier chapters. Here I’d like to discuss some additional file and storage 
options and introduce you to some terms you might see as you continue to work with 
Windows To Go in an enterprise environment. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES

 Microsoft Azure 
 Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and cloud infrastructure that enables 
enterprises to build their own applications and configure and manage their own services 
in the cloud, using a worldwide group of secure, managed, datacenters. Because we are 
concerned mostly with Windows To Go clients, Microsoft Azure might provide enterprises 
another solution for storing data in the cloud. 
 Of course, with any cloud option, security is one of the most important things to 
consider. In that vein it’s important to note that Microsoft Azure incorporates redundant 
and numerous safeguards to protect your enterprise data. The technologies used to 
do this continue to evolve too, and you can be sure that any improvements will be 
implemented where applicable. 
 The security practices and technologies available with Microsoft Azure include:
• 
 Azure Active Directory — Active Directory in the cloud ensures 
that only users who are fully authenticated and authorized can 
access data stored in Azure datacenters. Microsoft Azure offers 
multifactor authentication as well, to further protect sensitive 
enterprise data. 
• 
 Encryption — Microsoft Azure uses encryption to protect data as 
it moves among devices and datacenters. This encryption uses 
industry-standard protocols over all types of connections. You'll 
learn more about protocols later in the chapter, when we talk 
about securing VPNs. 
• 
 Secure Networks — Microsoft Azure uses only trusted networks 
and proven protocols to provide secure networks for data 
transmissions. The technology behind it is built on trusted 
security practices. The protocols ensure that the traffic you want 
to pass gets passed, and the traffic you don’t want is blocked. 
• 
 Virtual Networks — Microsoft Azure uses virtual networks to 
connect your enterprise network to the datacenters to extend 
your on-premises network effectively and easily. You’ll learn more 
about how virtual networks are secured toward the end of this 
chapter. 
• 
 Microsoft Antimalware — This software protects virtual machines 
as well as all Azure services. It protects against all kinds of threats, 
both internal and external, including viruses, worms, Trojan 
horses, denial-of-service attacks, and more. 
 In addition, you have control over your enterprise data. You control who sees what, 
and who can access what data. It's also important to note that Microsoft engineers do not 
access your data. Engineers do have access to manage the data, but only when necessary, 
and during the management processes they never actually look at your data. The same 
is true of the subcontractors they employ. Likewise, when a government entity requests 
access to stored data in hosted datacenters, Microsoft limits what it discloses. There is no 
direct access given to any government agency, and any and all requests are redirected to 
the customer. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES

 To try Microsoft Azure, visit the   web page  shown in Figure  6-1 . You can review videos 
and set up a free account and get a 30-day free trial. At the time this book was written, you 
could also get a $200 credit to spend on Azure services, allowing you to try out the entire 
enterprise solution for free. 
 File and Storage Services 
 Windows servers can be configured to serve in various capacities. You might already 
have a print server, data server, e-mail server, and so on in your network. With regard to 
Windows To Go clients, it can be useful to create a file and storage server as well. A file 
and storage server provides a central location where you can store users’ data securely, 
back it up on your own terms, and manage data access. You can also put data there you’d 
like your users to access, such as company handbooks, forms, and so on. 
 To turn a Windows server into a file and storage server you’ll incorporate the File 
and Storage Services role (it's installed by default) and then install the appropriate role 
services. Some specific applications you can consider when planning a file and storage 
server are outlined next. 
 Work Folders 
 Work Folders is a new feature only recently made available in Windows Server 2012 R2. 
Work Folders lets users store and access their work files on their own devices, as well 
as on corporate computers, for the purpose of allowing users to work from virtually 
 Figure 6-1.  Get a free trial account to explore Microsoft Azure 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
92
anywhere and from almost any type of device, even when they are offline. Their files are 
stored on network file servers, which are managed by network administrators, so they 
are secure and protected just like all other enterprise data. Like other technologies, it’s 
possible to specify device policies (such as requiring encryption) for those users you 
allow to access the server and incorporate work folders on their own machines. 
 If you put Work Folders into place in your enterprise, and if it’s not enabled on your 
Windows To Go workspaces during deployment, Windows To Go users can enable Work 
Folders from inside Control Panel. Figure  6-2 shows this. 
 Figure 6-2.  Windows users can enable Work Folders from Control Panel 
 As far as the end user goes, Work Folders should stay up to date automatically, 
provided it has online access for syncing when necessary. However, users can sync 
manually in the Work Folders window by clicking Work Folders and Sync Now.  
 Data Deduplication 
 Another server feature to consider is Data Deduplication. You might know that data is 
stored in blocks. Blocks are provided by hard drives and similar hardware, and you only 
have a limited amount of blocks to work with, no matter the scenario. Data Deduplication 
can help reduce the disk space requirements of the files you need to manage by reducing 
the number of duplicate blocks of data you store. 
 By incorporating Data Deduplication into your enterprise, you can save space on 
file storage, which, in turn, can save you money. In general terms you can reduce storage 
needs by half. 
 
■ Note  There is redundancy built in to data deduplication technologies using checksums 
and similar algorithms to protect data that has been modified to reduce the storage required.  
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
93
 iSCSI Target Server 
 iSCSI Target Server is another server role to consider because you can use it to manage 
storage much better than you can with other, existing technologies. Enterprises add this 
role to create consolidated, software-based, and iSCSI disk subsystems that they use 
in large storage area networks (SANs). Combined with other technologies and by also 
incorporating differencing virtual hard disks, enterprises can save up to 90 percent of the 
storage space necessary to hold the images they use for desktops, laptops, and Windows 
To Go drives. If you’re planning on very large deployments of identical Windows To Go 
drives, desktops, or even servers, it’s something to consider. 
 In addition, for applications that require raw storage that can be accessed remotely, 
the iSCSI Target Server role can provide continuously available block storage to those 
applications that need it (like Hyper-V). iSCSI Target Server also supports iSCSI on 
operating systems other than Windows, so you can incorporate other operating systems 
and devices where applicable. 
 Storage Spaces 
 Storage Spaces is another option for managing storage that's available in various 
Windows editions. Storage Spaces lets you group any spare disks you have and aren’t 
using or disks you’ve purchased (perhaps inexpensively just for this purpose) into pools 
of virtual hard disks. Storage spaces that you create are scalable, which means you can 
add disks as more storage is needed. 
 Once you've created a storage space, you manage the pooled disks as one virtual 
disk, which makes management of these disks easier than managing multiple disks 
separately. If you’d like to experiment with storage pools and don’t have an edition of 
Windows Server available to you, you can configure Storage Spaces in Windows 10. 
Figure  6-3 shows the applicable window in Control Panel. 
 Figure 6-3.  Storage Spaces is available in Windows 10 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
94
 Unified Remote Management 
 Prior to Windows Server 2012, if you needed to manage multiple file servers you had 
to incorporate Remote Desktop to connect to each server, or you had to open various 
instances of the applicable administration console for every computer you needed to 
manage. In Windows Server 2012, things changed, and it became possible to use Server 
Manager to perform a lot of everyday administrative functions from a single console, 
reducing the need to use these older methods of management. The technology that was 
added is Unified Remote Management. 
 You use Unified Remote Management on a Windows server that runs File and 
Storage Services. Unified management lets you perform tasks on remote servers such as 
restarting servers, launching administrative tools, and managing storage pools, as well 
as managing single volumes and even scanning for errors. You can even configure Data 
Deduplication and manage network shares. You can also create new iSCSI virtual disks 
and work with existing iSCSI virtual disks. In addition, Server Manager’s Tools menu 
offers access to even more options, including but not limited to File Server Resource 
Manager, DFS Management, and Services for Network File System (NFS). 
 Windows PowerShell 
 If you haven’t explored Windows PowerShell as an option to manage and protect data 
and network shares, it’s time to do so. You can use PowerShell to automate many tasks 
by creating or using existing PowerShell scripts. You can use PowerShell to manage these 
items and more:
• 
 Branch Cache 
• 
 Data Deduplication 
• 
 File Server Resource Manager 
• 
 iSCSI Target 
• 
 Server for NFS 
• 
 Storage 
• 
 Storage Spaces 
• 
 Work Folders 
 You can learn how to script with PowerShell from Microsoft’s TechNet site, as well as 
other places. You can also open a PowerShell window from Windows 10 and type Help to 
learn more inside the shell itself. See Figure  6-4 . 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
95
 BitLocker in More Technical Terms 
 You know that BitLocker uses encryption to protect the system files stored on operating 
system drives, and that BitLocker protects computer hard drives from being accessed if 
they are removed from one computer and connected to another. It does this by checking 
the integrity of the system files prior to offering the logon screen. You know further that 
BitLocker can be used on Windows To Go drives, providing additional protection there 
if the drive is lost or stolen. And while I’ve talked a lot about why to use BitLocker and 
how to enable BitLocker already in this book, I’ve yet to discuss how BitLocker works 
with a TPM, how to store BitLocker keys, and the various other ways you can work with 
BitLocker in an enterprise. 
 Figure 6-4.  Learn more about PowerShell 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
96
 BitLocker and TPM 
 BitLocker performs best and offers the most protection to the user and device when it’s 
used on a desktop or laptop PC that is also installed with a TPM, a physical chip that is 
contained on the motherboard. This chip, in conjunction with BitLocker, ensures the 
computer and the hard drive haven’t been compromised since last use. There is no access 
to the hard drive or logon screen until this is verified. 
 With a TPM, BitLocker provides the following:
• 
 Protects against boot sector viruses as well as rootkits by ensuring 
that no modifications have been made to the boot files since 
the last check (boot). If a breach is found, BitLocker won’t allow 
access to the drive. 
• 
 Lessens the likelihood of software attacks. Rogue software won’t 
have access to the decryption keys it needs to access the operating 
system. 
 On computers and devices that don’t include a TPM, BitLocker can still encrypt 
the drive and provide protection if there is some other kind of additional verification 
included. For a computer user, additional authentication often means inserting a USB 
startup key smart card, or a similar mechanism. Additionally, without a TPM, BitLocker 
can’t provide any system integrity verifications as it would on a computer with one. It 
is the TPM that provides this verification, so it makes sense that can't happen if a TPM 
doesn't exist. 
 If a USB startup key, smart card, or similar device won’t work as a security 
mechanism, such as is the case with a removable drive, the user can input a PIN. 
Windows To Go workspaces use a PIN. 
 Note that a computer with a TPM must also have a compatible BIOS that can 
communicate with the TPM and startup system. What’s required is a Trusted Computing 
Group (TCG)-compliant BIOS. Computers that come with a TPM will likely come with 
the required BIOS; I've never heard of an instance where it doesn't, at least not with 
computers from major manufacturers. For all computer systems, the BIOS must support 
the USB mass storage device class. 
 BitLocker and Recovery Keys 
 When you enable BitLocker on a Windows To Go drive, the BitLocker process creates 
a recovery key. The recovery key, sometimes called a recovery password, is a 48-digit, 
randomly generated number. If you ever need to access a drive that is BitLocker enabled 
and you don’t know the PIN or password, or have access to any other mechanism to 
unlock that drive, you’ll need to have that key handy to recover the drive. Thus, having a 
plan to store the recovery keys for your users is extremely important. 
 There are lots of ways to store the key, including writing it down, storing it to a cloud 
drive, storing it on a domain server, and more. You could even save it to the Windows To 
Go drive, although that would not be any help if the drive wasn't accessible. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
97
 If you haven't backed up your key, from your Windows To Go drive, access the option 
to back up an existing recovery key from the BitLocker area of Control Panel. Figure  6-5 
shows this option.  
 Figure 6-5.  You can back up a recovery key from Control Panel 
 In an enterprise, backing up recovery keys isn’t left to the end user. Instead, a Group 
Policy setting is configured to automatically back up those keys to an Active Directory 
domain server. You can review the Group Policy Setting on a Windows 10 computer by 
following these steps:
 
 1. 
  Log on to the computer as an administrator.  
 
 2. 
 Use the Windows key + R combination to open a Run dialog box.  
 
 3. 
 Type gpedit.msc and click OK. 
 
 4. 
 Navigate to  Computer Configuration\Administrative 
Templates\Windows Components . 
 
 5. 
 Click BitLocker Drive Encryption. 
 
 6. 
  Double-click Store BitLocker recovery information in Active 
Directory Domain Services (Windows Server 2008 and 
Windows Vista). 
 
 7. 
  Note the setting is enabled by default. 
 
 8. 
 Close all dialog boxes and windows. 
 How BitLocker Works 
 You know BitLocker can be configured for use with a TPM to protect a drive. In a device 
with a TPM, the encryption keys are locked until the TPM verifies system integrity. This 
works as follows:
 
 1. 
  During startup, the TPM compares a hash it has already 
collected during the last successful computing session with 
the one that exists now. 
 
 2. 
  The two values are compared. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
98
 
 3. 
 If the values are the same, the TPM releases the decryption 
key. If the values do not agree, no key is offered and the boot 
process stops. 
 
 4. 
 If TPM is combined with another authentication requirement, 
like a PIN, that must be input before boot-up continues. 
 If there’s no TPM, the user is required to input the proper credentials to unlock the 
encryption key and thus enable access to the drive. 
 Secure Access Between the Host and a Windows 
To Go Workspace 
 If you’ve ever used Windows To Go and tried to access the host’s internal hard drives, 
you know that you can’t (or you’re not supposed to be able to). This is part of the built-
in security that comes with Windows To Go. The same is true of the host. If the host is 
running and a Windows To Go drive is inserted, that drive should not be accessible either. 
But this isn't always the case; with the right knowledge and a few clicks of the mouse, a 
host can access a Windows To Go drive. 
 Because it is possible to access a Windows To Go drive from a host if you are really 
tech-savvy, it's best to use the NoDefaultDriveLetter attribute when provisioning the USB 
drive. If the user does know how to assign a drive letter, the drive will display in Windows 
Explorer once it's mounted. The attribute you need to apply is applied automatically if 
you create the drive using the Windows To Go creator. 
 With the proper security mechanisms in place, when a Windows To Go drive is 
inserted into a running host, the host will not be able to see the Windows To Go drive but 
will still be able to see other drives attached as applicable. Figure  6-6  shows a computer 
with various drives and partitions, but notice that you can’t see the attached Windows To 
Go drive. 
 Figure 6-6.  The host can access all of its attached drives and partitions but can’t, by 
default, see an attached Windows To Go drive. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
99
 Now, if you are the host and have a Windows To Go drive attached and you need 
to access the contents of that drive, you can mount the drive in the Disk Management 
Console and then access that data from File Explorer. 
 To mount a Windows To Go drive using the Disk Management Console:
 
 1. 
 Use Windows key + R to open a Run dialog box. 
 
 2. 
  Type diskmgmt.msc and click OK. 
 
 3. 
  In Disk Management, right-click the drive (it might be in the 
Disk 2 section) and select Change Drive Letter and Path. 
 
 4. 
 In the resulting dialog box, shown in Figure  6-7 , click Add, and 
select a drive letter. 
 Figure 6-7.  You can mount a Windows To Go drive in Disk Management to enable access 
to its contents 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
100
 
 6. 
 Finally, note what’s on the drive. You can access the files on 
it by double-clicking in File Explorer. See Figure  6-9 . (Here 
I’ve drilled down to the User’s files, and into the Joli Ballew 
account. I’ve input administrator credentials to get to these 
personal files.) 
 Figure 6-8.  Once you’ve mounted the Windows To Go drive you can access it from File Explorer  
 Figure 6-9.  A host can access a Windows To Go drive if it’s been mounted in Disk Management  
 
 5. 
 Note that the drive letter is assigned; open File Explorer to see 
the mounted drive. See Figure  6-8 (as compared to Figure  6-6 ).   
 
 7. 
  To remove the drive letter, repeat the process above, only click 
Remove in Step 4. 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
101
 
■ Caution   Know that without the proper safeguards in place, an unattended Windows 
To Go drive might be accessible if the host’s user is tech-savvy and knows how to mount a 
drive in Disk Management. 
 DirectAccess and Domain Join 
 I’ve mentioned both DirectAccess and Domain Join in this book but I’d like to go 
into a little more depth here. DirectAccess is an additional role service of the Remote 
Access server role and it enables users to access the network and the resources on it 
without using a VPN connection. With this technology, clients are always connected to 
the enterprise, provided they're online. This isn’t a solution where users need to start 
a connection or stop one. If a client is running and Internet-connected, the client is 
connected to your enterprise. 
 DirectAccess is a pretty new technology, though, and isn’t supported on all clients. 
This list shows what editions of Windows can use DirectAccess as either a server or a client:
• 
  All versions of Windows Server 2012 R2 
• 
  All versions of Windows Server 2012 
• 
  All versions of Windows Server 2008 R2 
 This list shows what editions of Windows clients support DirectAccess:
• 
 Windows 10 Enterprise 
• 
  Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB)  
• 
 Windows 8 Enterprise 
• 
 Windows 7 Ultimate 
• 
 Windows 7 Enterprise 
 Domain Join was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2. This feature lets computers 
join a domain without ever actually contacting a domain controller. You can perform 
this task during the provisioning process and join computers or Windows To Go drives 
to the domain immediately after installation completes, to make the provisioning and 
deployment process for efficient. 
 
■ Note  When Domain Join is used it establishes a trust relationship between a compatible 
Windows computer or Windows To Go drive and an Active Directory domain.  

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
102
 Offline Domain Join is an extension of Domain Join and can provide the following 
enhancements to your network infrastructure:
• 
 When large numbers of computers or drives are provisioned, 
during a normal Domain Join process the computer would need 
to be rebooted. With Offline Domain Join you can input the 
Domain Join information on the production computer, and make 
it part of the deployment and provisioning process. Done this 
way, no additional restart is required. 
• 
 When you use Domain Join with a read-only domain controller 
you reduce the number of steps previously required to complete 
the process. 
• 
 If you use deployment tools such as Windows System Image 
Manager, you can perform an unattended Domain Join. You 
provide the information in your Unattend.xml file. Again, doing so 
saves both time and resources. 
 Once you’ve decided to use Domain Join, you use the command-line utility 
Djoin.exe to get started. The general steps for using Djoin.exe are:
 
 1. 
 Run  djoin /provision . This creates the computer account 
metadata. 
 
 2. 
 Note the resulting text file. 
 
 3. 
 Run  djoin /requestODJ . Insert the computer account 
metadata from the .txt file into the Windows directory of the 
destination computer. 
 
 4. 
 Reboot the destination computer. 
 
 5. 
 Wait while the computer joins the domain. 
 For more information on DirectAccess and Domain Join, refer to the articles 
available at Microsoft TechNet’s site. 
 Securing Data Transmissions via VPN 
 VPNs are networks that provide connections that are used to join two computers across 
a private or public network, such as the Internet. VPNs use a variety of TCP/IP tunneling 
protocols to secure these connections. 
 So how does this work? To start, the VPN client works within the protocol parameters 
to call to and connect to a virtual port on a VPN server, which ultimately authenticates the 
caller and allows access to the network. In many of our scenarios in this book, a Windows 
To Go client would use a VPN to connect to a Windows-based virtual server on an 
enterprise network, for the purpose of gaining access to network resources, storing and 
accessing data, and so on. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
103
 To secure connections, a virtual point-to-point link is established between the 
client and server. Data that is sent is encapsulated and encrypted for security. The 
encapsulation includes information, in the form of a header, about where the data comes 
from and where it’s going, among other things. The data also incorporates encryption 
information, including encryption keys. If the data is breached on its way to the 
destination, it won’t be readable. Only a computer with the proper decryption keys can 
unencrypt the data. 
 There are two types of VPNs. One is a VPN connection where users who are away 
from the office access network resources over the Internet. This is a remote access VPN 
and is what your Windows To Go users will employ. The other is a connection where 
two routers are involved instead of a client and a server. The two routers often connect 
separate facilities in the same organization, or two organizations that form a trust. When 
routers are connected, data packets are forwarded from one to the other and back. 
 
VPNS AREN'T RIGHT FOR EVERY ENVIRONMENT
 Here are a few reasons why you would not opt for a VPN:
• 
 If the organization is using an Internet-based VPN, reliability and 
performance will be not under the business's direct control. 
• 
 Despite what it sounds like in the real world a VPN isn't particularly 
easy for a business to create or deploy since a lot of cases and 
scenarios must be considered. 
• 
 VPNs can pose a security risk when used with wireless devices. 
 VPN Protocols 
 VPN protocols are often referred to as tunneling protocols. Tunneling is what enables the 
encapsulation of packets, and it is also what secures them. Tunneling technologies are 
what allows for data to be transmitted over and through different types of networks too, 
such as data that comes from a private enterprise to and through the Internet to another 
private enterprise or client. 
 A protocol is a set of rules and standards that allows systems to communicate 
effectively. Computers use protocols to define how transmissions occur and under what 
circumstances. The protocol used depends on what’s required of the transmission. It also 
depends on the client. Because protocols evolve over time, a computer running Windows 
XP doesn't always support all of the protocols that a computer running Windows 10 will. 
The same is true of servers. A Windows 2000 Server has far fewer capabilities than, say, 
a Server 2008 R2 or a Server 2012 computer does, and this includes protocol support. 
 In the upcoming sections I’ll introduce you to some common protocols including 
PPTP, L2TP, and SSTP. If you’d like to see how to configure a specific protocol prior to 
reviewing the options you can do so by creating a VPN on an applicable client machine 
and then looking at the properties for that connection. Here’s how to do that on a

 Click the arrow under Type of VPN, shown in Figure  6-12 . 
Note the protocol options. 
 
 11. 
 Click Cancel and close all open windows. 
 Now that you’ve seen where to configure protocols for VPN connections, let’s take a 
closer look at what these protocols offer. You can use all three for VPN connections too. 
However, they do have differences. 
 PPTP 
 You’ll use this protocol to send multiprotocol traffic across a private IP intranet network or 
a public one, like the Internet. When data transmissions occur over the Internet, the VPN 
server incorporates two network interfaces. The first connects to the Internet, the second the 
intranet. You can use this protocol for remote access and site-to-site VPN connections too. 
 
■ Caution  Note that PPTP has its own set of risks because the protocol is no longer 
secure, as cracking the initial MS-CHAPv2 authentication can be reduced to the difficulty of 
cracking a single DES (Data Encryption Standard) 56-bit key. 
 Figure 6-12.  Locate the protocol options including PPTP, L2TP, and SSTP 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
107
 The encapsulation process uses IP datagrams for transmission and encapsulates 
PPP frames. These frames can be encrypted or compressed, or both encrypted and 
compressed. The PPP frame uses Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE). 
Encryption keys are created from either the MS-CHAP v2 or EAP-TLS authentication 
process. MS-CHAP v2 is user-level authentication. This prevents unauthorized users 
from calling the router. EAP-TLS is a more secure than MS-CHAP v2. It’s also user-level 
authentication and can be used on a dial-up, PPTP VPN, or L2TP/IPSec VPN connection. 
EAP-TLS requires the enterprise have a certificate infrastructure, because it requires a 
user certificate to call the router. It also requires a computer certificate for the server 
performing the authentication. 
 Virtual private networking clients like those who use Windows To Go must use the 
MS-CHAP v2 or EAP-TLS authentication protocol if they need their PPP frames to be 
encrypted. PPTP-based VPN connections do not provide data integrity though. Data 
integrity is what verifies that the data wasn’t tampered with during the transmission 
process, but it doesn’t verify that data was sent by a user who had been previously been 
authorized.  
 PPTP can be used with Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, 
Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, and Windows 10 as well as all editions of Windows Server 2008 
and 2012. PPTP does not require the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which 
enterprises would need to incorporate if they wanted to create, and manage, use and 
store, and revoke digital certificates, among other things.   
 L2TP 
 You’ll use this protocol to send encrypted, multiprotocol traffic over any type of network, 
provided it supports point-to-point delivery. L2TP provides IPSec encryption and 
encapsulation. The combination of L2TP and IPsec is referred to as L2TP/IPsec. There 
are some concerns here as well, though, such as getting around firewalls. Use L2TP over 
PPTP though, when more secure protocols can't be implemented. 
 To use this protocol both the VPN client and server have to support it. Almost all 
Windows computers in use today do and L2TP is installed by default with the TCP/IP 
protocol. Support is built in Windows XP and Vista clients, as well as those after. Any 
server that’s Windows Server 2003 and beyond is supported too. 
 With L2TP, data packets are encapsulated with two layers of protection. The PPP 
datagram is wrapped with appropriate header information and wrapped again with an 
IPSec header and trailer. The entire message is encrypted with either DES or Triple DES 
(3DES). The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is used to generate the encryption keys. 
 With this protocol some sort of authentication method is required. These can be 
computer certificates (recommended) or preshared keys. If you opt for certificates you’ll 
need access to a PKI to issue them. The protocol when used correctly provides more 
protection than PPTP because it provides data integrity and confidentiality, among other 
things. Like PPTP, L2TP can be used with clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or 
Windows Vista, as well as Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. Windows Server 2003 and later are 
compatible too. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SECURE AND PROTECT WINDOWS TO GO DRIVES
108
 SSTP 
 This is a newer protocol than the previous two, and it encapsulates PPP datagrams 
through the SSL protocol and uses certificates to verify identities. It uses the HTTPS 
protocol over TCP port 443 to transfer the data. It can pass data through firewalls that 
might otherwise block the previously discussed protocols. 
 Data is encapsulated with PPP over the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) channel of the 
HTTPS protocol. Thus it’s possible to incorporate better security, key negotiation, and 
encryption because it supports authentication protocols like EAP-TLS. 
 Because SSTP is a newer protocol, it can only be used with client computers running 
Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) and higher or Windows Server 2008 and higher. Like 
L2TP with IPSec, this protocol provides data integrity, data confidentiality, and data 
authentication. 
 Summary of VPN Connections 
 VPN connections that use any of the three protocols outlined here provide some form of 
encapsulation, encryption, and authentication of data and transmissions. Encapsulation 
wraps the datagrams with a header that contains routing information. The information 
added depends on the protocol selected. 
 The data is encrypted by the sending computer and decrypted by the receiving 
computer. Encrypting and decryption depend on shared encryption keys. Both the sender 
and receiver must recognize and have the required keys to complete the transmission. 
Because data is encrypted with keys, anyone who intercepts packets can’t read them 
without the proper decryption key. 
 Authentication can be user-level authentication, where the VPN server authenticates 
the client using PPP, or it can be computer-level authentication, where IPSec is used in 
combination with preshared keys or computer certificates. The latter type of connection 
is available with L2TP/IPSec communication. 
 Summary 
 It's important to understand the available security mechanisms and protocols used to 
protect Windows To Go drives, so that you can make educated decisions during planning 
processes. Once those decisions are made, it's important to know how you'll manage 
the data your Windows To Go users create while on their drives. There are many options 
for that, including in house, in the cloud, or hybrid solutions. In Chapter   7 you'll learn 
about using Windows 10 in a business scenario, focusing on your end users and practical 
applications.

 CHAPTER 7  
 Windows 10 for Business 
 It’s likely that your employees have been using Windows 8/8.1, or possibly even Windows 7, 
prior to your giving them a Windows To Go workspace running Windows 10. If that’s the 
case, you’ll need to provide some training on how to use the new operating system prior 
to sending them out into the field with it. In this chapter I’ll outline what they need to 
know to get on board with Windows 10 as quickly as possible. 
 To get you started, I’ll address the newer features first, for those employees who are 
familiar with Windows 8/8.1, including how to use the new Start menu, the Store (if it’s 
enabled), Cortana, the Microsoft Edge web browser, and Virtual Desktops. I’ll introduce 
you to Settings, a new, unified place to configure how you want Windows to behave and 
perform. After that I’ll address how to work with various networks, how to connect, how 
to modify network adapter settings, and so on. I’ll address local accounts, Microsoft 
accounts, and domain accounts too, so that all possible usages for Windows To Go 
get some screen time here. I’ll talk about File Explorer too, and how users incorporate 
OneDrive, Google Drive, and so on, for those users who don’t belong to a domain and 
need some way to save files off the drive. 
 The Start Menu 
 Windows 10 has a new Start menu. Part of this and the reasoning behind creating 
Windows 10 the way Microsoft did was to try to unify the various software platforms 
across all of the available Windows devices. So, this Start menu replaces the Start screen 
introduced in Windows 8/8.1 and gives users a more familiar look and feel no matter 
what device they are on. There’s a Start button in the bottom left corner that users can 
click to get to familiar places like Control Panel, the Documents folder, Network settings 
and so on. Users can right-click the Start button to access a sort of “power” menu which 
includes links to the Command prompt and Device Manager, among other things. The 
Start menu also offers access to the installed apps, like Mail and Maps. Figure  7-1 shows 
what my Start menu looks like. Note that you can configure the menu to look just about 
any way you like. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
110
 You can also see in Figure  7-1 that there’s an option to search directly from the 
Taskbar. This is how your users will likely opt to find things like files, folders, applications, 
and settings. You can type anything there, and the results generally offer what you’re 
looking for. 
 You can also right-click any item you see on the Start Menu or in the tiles area (that’s 
the right side of the Start menu) to edit it. For instance, you can right-click an item in the 
list on the left to remove it from the list, uninstall it from the computer, or pin it to the 
Start menu, among other things. When you opt to pin an item to the Start menu it appears 
as a tile in the left pane. Figure  7-2 shows some of these options. 
 Figure 7-1.    The Windows Start menu looks quite a bit different from what users are likely 
familiar with, and offers two panels side by side, with the left column showing pinned 
items, recently added items, and most used apps 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
111
 You can edit how the Start menu looks by dragging and dropping the tiles on the 
right side as well. Figure  7-3 shows this in action. To do this, simply hold down the left 
mouse button as you drag, and once the item is where you want it, let go of that button. 
After you try this, right-click any tile to see options to resize, turn a live tile off (that’s a tile 
that changes as information does, like e-mail or the weather), and more.  
 Figure 7-2.  Right-click any item on the left side of the Start menu to edit it 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
112
 Finally, at the bottom of the Start screen, on the left side, is the option All apps. Click 
All apps to see a list of the applications installed on your computer. If you find an app you 
never use, you can access the uninstall option by right-clicking. You can also pin any app 
to the Start screen or Taskbar among other things. 
 Figure 7-3.  Drag and drop any tile to move it 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
113
 
■ Note   Windows 8 and 8.1 offered apps that opened in their own special window in full 
screen mode and were not available on the desktop, nor could they be specifically resized 
by the user (although they could be snapped to one side or the other). Universal apps now 
available in Windows 10 can be used in traditional windows on the desktop. 
 Figure 7-4.    Use the All apps view to access and manage additional apps 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
114
 The Microsoft Store 
 You may or may not have access to the Microsoft Store from your Windows To Go drive, but 
if you do, you can explore it now to see what’s available. To access the Store, click the Start 
button and then the Store tile. If you don’t see the tile, type Store in the Search Windows box 
on the Taskbar and select it from the resulting list. Figure  7-5 shows the Store.  
 Figure 7-5.  The Store offers a place to obtain apps 
 To obtain an app that is free, you simply click the app you want and click Free. 
The app will install and be ready to use within a few seconds. The first time you try to 
purchase an app, you’ll be prompted to input credit card information, a gift card, or 
similar form of payment. Once that’s done you won’t have to do it again until your card 
expires or you want to change payment options. 
 Cortana 
 Cortana is Microsoft’s digital voice assistant, which is Microsoft’s voice-controlled 
addition to Windows. It hopes to make it easier to interact with Windows without using 
a keyboard or moving a mouse. You can talk to Cortana the same way you likely already 
talk to your phone, by asking questions, saying commands, and asking Cortana to remind 
you of things or tell you about the weather or traffic conditions. The first time you use 
Windows Search on the Taskbar you’ll probably be prompted to set it up, but if you miss 
that or want to do it later, there is a small circle available after you click inside the Search 
Windows area that will let you pick up where you left off. Figure  7-6 shows this. From the 
screen shown here, just work through the setup process. Cortana will get to know your 
voice, where you live, and so on, and then you can use it effectively.  
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
115
 To use voice commands you address Cortana using the “Hey Cortana” feature. With 
this on, you say “Hey Cortana,” and Cortana will ask you how she can help. You need to 
enable this feature though, as follows:
 
 1. 
  Type “Cortana settings” in the Search area of the Taskbar. 
 
 2. 
  Click Cortana and Search Settings in the results.  
 Figure 7-6.    Set up Cortana so that you can incorporate the built-in digital assistant in 
Windows 10 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
116
 
 3. 
 Switch the toggle from Off to On under “Cortana can give you 
suggestions, ideas, reminders, alerts and more.” See Figure  7-7 .      
 Figure 7-7.  Enable Cortana to recognize your voice 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
117
 
■ Note   Windows 10 provides a new way to access all notifications from a single place. 
It collects alerts from all of your devices and from all installed apps and provides 
notifications in real time. 
 
 4. 
  Configure other options as desired. 
 
 5. 
  Opt to use Cortana if prompted and follow any additional 
setup suggestions. 
 Here are some commands and questions you can ask Cortana once it’s up and running:
• 
 What’s the weather like? 
• 
 What’s my schedule look like today? 
• 
  Is my flight on time? 
• 
  Give me directions to . . .. 
• 
  What’s traffic like today? 
• 
  Hey Cortana, create an appointment. 
• 
  When is my next appointment? 
• 
 Set an alarm for . . .. 
• 
  When is Memorial Day? 
• 
  What’s on TV tonight? 
• 
 What time is it in France? 
• 
  Where can I go to eat tonight? 
• 
  What’s in a Long Island Ice Tea? 
 And so on . . .. 
 Remember too that Cortana can search your hard drive for specific folders and 
files, and can even send e-mails while you’re doing something else, like working on a 
spreadsheet, which makes multitasking all that more efficient. 
 Microsoft Edge 
 Microsoft Edge is a new web browser available from Microsoft and included with 
Windows 10. There’s an icon for it on the Taskbar. It has an app-like feel to it, but it’s a 
desktop application. It’s streamlined, so it’s a good browser for tablet users, or those 
with smaller monitors. You use it as you would any web browser, and configure settings 
by clicking the ellipsis and clicking Settings in the results. Figure  7-8 shows this option. 
From Settings you can configure home pages, block pop-ups, use Adobe Flash Player, and 
more. As far as security goes, ActiveX is gone and the AppContainer Sandbox is always on. 
Flash is still enabled by default though; something to keep in mind if you’re planning to 
use it out of the box. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
118
 
■ Note   Microsoft has been working on the Spartan Project, a new web browser that will 
offer instant sharing, distraction-free reading, built-in PDF support, better ways to search 
and with more efficiency, and more ways to work than ever before. 
 Multitasking with Virtual Desktops 
 Virtual Desktops is a new feature of Windows 10 that enables users to create more than 
one desktop and switch among them easily. It’s like having multiple versions of Windows 
open at the same time. The default setup is one desktop, which is what users know and 
use now, no matter what operating system they have experience with. But it’s possible to 
add another desktop, and, in fact, multiple desktops. 
 Some users find that they enjoy Windows 10 more if they use their default desktop 
for things they do for work, such as open applications, spreadsheets, web browsers, 
documents, and so on, and keep another desktop for personal items like personal e-mail, 
photos, their favorite web browser, and so on. Figure  7-9 shows how to create a virtual 
desktop. 
 Figure 7-8.  Microsoft Edge is a new web browsing experience available in Windows 10 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
119
 Here are the steps:
 
 1. 
  Click the Virtual Desktop icon on the Taskbar. It’s next to the 
Search window on the Taskbar. 
 
 2. 
 Click the + sign in the bottom right corner of the screen. 
 
 3. 
 Click the new desktop, named Desktop 2. 
 
 4. 
  Note that there is nothing on that desktop. Open apps and 
such as desired. 
 
 5. 
  To switch to the previous desktop, click the Virtual Desktop 
button again, and select the desired desktop. 
 Once you have at least one virtual desktop configured, explore the Virtual Desktop 
settings. You can find those settings by searching for them in the Search window of the 
Taskbar. There are only two settings to configure:
• 
  On the Taskbar, show windows that are open: Only on the desktop 
I’m using or All Desktops. 
• 
  Pressing Alt + Tab shows windows that are open: Only on the 
desktop I’m using or All Desktops. 
 
■ Tip    You can use Snap Assist with the virtual desktops you create just as you can when 
working in a single desktop. Snap Assist lets you “snap” two windows next to each other on 
the screen and pin up to four different apps onto one screen. Snap Assist works differently 
in tablet mode but should work great for Windows To Go users. 
 Figure 7-9.  Create a virtual desktop 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
120
 Settings 
 Windows 7 offered Control Panel for making configuration changes to Windows. 
Windows 8 and 8.1 offered that as well (as does Windows 10) but a new feature was 
added, called Settings. That was available from the Charms bar. In Windows 10, Settings 
still exists but the Charms bar is gone. You open Settings from the Start menu. This opens 
a Control Panel-like area where you can make changes to how your computer functions. 
Figure  7-10  shows the Settings window. If you don’t see this screen when you open 
Settings, you’ve previously navigated away from it, so you’ll need to click the Settings icon 
in whatever window appears, to return to this home screen for the Settings window. 
 There are several sections: System, Devices, Network and Internet, Personalization, 
Accounts, Time and Language, Ease of Access, Privacy, and Update and Security. It’s 
important to know what’s available in each section, so I’ll introduce each briefly here. 
 System 
 The System area of Settings offers a place users can personalize their system settings, at 
least those that aren’t managed by a domain administrator through Group Policy or a 
local administrator using Local Group Policy. Users might want to configure how many 
notifications they receive from Windows with regard to, say, Microsoft OneDrive, Skype, 
and things like “Get Office” reminders. They can configure Power options too, at least as 
they are applicable to Windows To Go workspaces. They can configure their default apps 
as well, perhaps to make Microsoft Outlook their default e-mail application instead of the 
Mail app, or Internet Explorer as the default instead of Microsoft Edge. 
 Figure 7-10.    Settings offers a place to make system-wide changes in lieu of using Control Panel 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
121
 Figure  7-11 shows the System window with Multitasking selected. Here users can 
decide if they want to use features such as Snap (Snap Assist was mentioned earlier in 
a Note), and how they want to configure the virtual desktops they create (more on this 
later). Like other areas of Settings, the changes they make here are saved to their user 
profile and are applied no matter what host they use. 
 Figure 7-11.    The System window offers users a place to customize system settings 
 
■ Note   To return to the main Settings window after navigating away from it, click the 
wheel icon next to Settings in the top left corner of the screen, or click the Back button. 
 Devices 
 The Devices area of Settings lets users configure settings for the devices attached to their 
device, and in the case of Windows To Go, these devices might include attached printers, 
but more likely users will come here to configure things like AutoPlay and Typing settings. 
Figure  7-12 shows the typing settings, and as with other settings the changes made here 
become part of the Windows To Go user’s profile. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
122
 Network and Internet 
 Users will come to the Network and Internet area of Settings to manage networks and 
network settings. Here they can connect and disconnect from networks and enable and 
disable Airplane Mode (although they can also do that from the Taskbar), connect to and 
manage VPNs, and view data usage among other things. Figure  7-13 shows the VPN options.  
 Figure 7-12.  Change settings that have to do with devices under the Devices area of Settings       
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
123
 Personalization 
 This is the area of Windows where users can configure personalization options such 
as desktop backgrounds and screensavers. They can configure the Lock screen too 
including what’s shown on it, although with Windows To Go this isn’t something users 
employ that often. Users can apply themes too, which are groupings of backgrounds, 
screensavers, sounds, mouse pointers, and so on. Anything you can do here you can also 
do in Control Panel, as is the case with most of the Settings options. Figure  7-14 shows the 
Personalization area of Windows 10 with Start selected. Here is where you configure the 
Start menu options. 
 Figure 7-13.    Users configure VPN settings in the Network and Internet area of Settings 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
124
 Accounts 
 You use the Accounts area of Settings to configure user accounts, account profiles, 
and work access and to configure Family Settings and more. A unique feature here for 
Windows To Go users is the Work Access area. Here, as shown in Figure  7-15 , users can:
• 
  Sign in to Azure AD — Azure AD is the option you can guide your 
users to if they need to sign in to Office 365 using an existing 
work or school account. You might preconfigure this during the 
provisioning process. 
• 
 Enroll in to device management — Device Management is a feature 
of larger enterprises where the network administrator manages the 
devices user bring to work and limits what they can do with those 
devices while connected to the corporate network. Administrators 
can deploy certificates, Wi-Fi, VPN, and e-mail profiles 
automatically using this technology and allow users to access 
corporate resources with the appropriate security configurations.  
 Figure 7-14.    Configure how the Start menu looks in the Personalization area of Settings 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
125
• 
  Join or leave an organization — Clicking this feature opens 
the About page in System Settings, allowing a user to leave an 
organization, join an Azure domain, and so on. 
• 
  Add or remove a management package — Used to manage the 
packages installed on the Windows To Go drive, specifically those 
used with Device Management features. 
 Figure 7-15.    Use the Work Access area of Accounts, in Settings to configure access to 
work-related resources 
 Time and Language 
 Here is where users can change, as applicable to them as allowed by Group Policy, 
settings related to time and language. You can change the time zone here, as well as date 
and time formats. Changes to language and country can be defined here too, and you can 
configure speech recognition settings. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
126
 Ease of Access 
 From Ease of Access users can configure, enable, and use features like Magnifier and 
Narrator, configure high contrast, and make other system changes that make it easier for 
people with disabilities to use Windows To Go. There are options for Closed Captioning, 
Keyboard, and Mouse as well. Figure  7-16 shows the setting High Contrast #1, which I’ve 
applied, which can be enabled for users who have trouble viewing the computer screen. 
 Figure 7-16.    High contrast settings are available to assist users who have trouble viewing 
the screen 
 Privacy 
 The Privacy settings offer more options than any other area of settings. As you can see 
in Figure  7-17 , there are lots of ways to configure privacy options. One of these options 
is Location Services. Location Services is necessary when using Cortana, as well as apps 
like Maps and Weather. In fact, you’ll be prompted to enable Location Services when you 
use these apps and features for the first time. You can make changes to Location Services 
here, including choosing what apps can have access to your location.  
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
127
 Other features here that Windows To Go users might want to configure include:
• 
  Speech, inking, & typing — Lets users allow Windows to learn 
their speech habits, access contacts, and even review handwriting 
samples to better understand how they use Windows.  
• 
  Contacts — Users can choose which apps can access their 
contacts list. 
• 
  Calendar — Users can choose which apps can access their 
calendar entries. 
• 
  Email — Users can configure which apps can access their default 
e-mail account to send e-mail from it. 
 Figure 7-17.    Location Services uses your location to make your Windows Experience 
more useful 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
128
• 
 Other devices — Users can configure which devices can 
communicate with Windows to sync with. These include Xboxes, 
projectors, and so on. Users will have access to an Xbox app soon 
too, which will enable them to play games on a PC or a tablet and 
not just on an Xbox console. 
• 
 Background apps — Users can configure which apps run in the 
background. Users might want to turn off unnecessary apps here 
like Microsoft Jigsaw or Get Office, as shown in Figure  7-18 . 
 Figure 7-18.  Users can configure what apps run in the background 
 Update and Security 
 Although users might be prohibited from making too many changes here, especially 
those in an enterprise, users of single Windows To Go drives will find plenty to work with. 
In Update & Security, shown in Figure  7-19 , users can:
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
129
• 
  Access Windows Update, check for, and install updates.  
• 
 Turn on or off Windows Defender and Cloud Protection. 
• 
  Configure File History, Windows 10 backup program.  
• 
 Activate Windows. 
 
■ Note   Although Recovery is an option here, Windows To Go drives can’t be recovered. 
They must be reprovisioned. 
 Networks 
 Windows To Go users will connect to lots of networks over the life of the workspace. In 
fact, they’ll connect to a network virtually every time they use the drive. It’s important to 
teach users the ways they can access network settings and how to use those settings not 
only to connect but also to troubleshoot when necessary. 
 There are three main ways users will work with networks and network settings: the 
Taskbar, the Network and Sharing Center, and the Network and Internet area of Settings. 
Let’s take a closer look at some of the available options. 
 Taskbar Settings 
 There’s a network icon on the Taskbar. Users might already be familiar with this from 
other editions of Windows. However, when you click the network icon in Windows 10, a 
new type of menu appears that’s much different from previous versions. As you can see 
in Figure  7-20 , all nearby networks are shown, as well as any configured VPNs. Users can 
click any item in this list to connect, provided they have the required credentials.

They can also disconnect from networks here. As you can see, they can also enable and 
disable Airplane mode. 
 
■ Note   If you click the icon that is blue at the bottom of the network list, the one the user 
is connected to, Wi-Fi is disabled. If a user can’t connect to a network make sure he or she 
knows to click this icon to enable Wi-Fi. It could have been accidentally turned off. 
 Manage Wi-Fi Networks 
 If your users have had experience with Windows 8, they’ll notice they are missing a 
few features. In Windows 8 users could right-click the networks shown to access other 
options, such as Forget this Network. That’s no longer available. To manage networks in 
that manner, the user will need to access the Network and Internet options in Settings. 
 Figure 7-20.    The Network icon on the Taskbar offers available networks

 To access these settings:
 
 1. 
  Click Start and click Settings. 
 
 2. 
 Click Network and Sharing. 
 
 3. 
 Click Wi-Fi. 
 
 4. 
 Click Manage Wi-Fi Settings. 
 
 5. 
 Scroll down to Manage Wi-Fi Networks. 
 
 6. 
  Click a network you’ve connected to. In Figure  7-21 , I’ve 
selected a hotel network.

 Click Forget. 
 While you’re here, click the Back arrow to return to the Network and Internet 
settings, and from Wi-Fi note that there are links to other areas of Windows where you can 
configure and manage networks. As shown in Figure  7-22 , you can access the Network 
and Sharing Center here, change adapter settings, set up a HomeGroup, and more.

 Network and Sharing Center 
 The Network and Sharing Center offers a more comprehensive, and possibly familiar, 
place to configure network settings. You can open this from the Network and Internet 
settings options shown earlier in Figure  7-22 or by right-clicking the Network icon on the 
Taskbar. Once you are there, notice these options, shown in Figure  7-23 :
• 
  View your active networks — to see if you are connected to a 
private, public, or domain network. 
• 
 Access type — to see if you are connected to the Internet or only a 
local network. 
• 
  Connection — to access the active connection to troubleshoot or 
view its properties. 
 Figure 7-22.    The Network and Sharing settings offers links to other network options 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
133
• 
 Set up a new connection or network — to configure a new 
connection, including VPNs. 
• 
  Troubleshoot problems — to access troubleshooting wizards to 
help resolve network problems. 
• 
  Change adapter settings — to see available network interface 
cards and view or manage their properties. 
• 
  Change advanced sharing options — to view settings for private, 
public, and domain networks. Access to these settings and others 
might be restricted by Group Policy. 
 Figure 7-23.  Use the Network and Sharing Center to manage networks 
 Troubleshoot Networks 
 For the most part, when problems arise, even if they are with networking, restarting 
the computer and reconnecting to the network is a good first step. And as with other 
operating systems, other viable solutions include updating device drivers, uninstalling 
and reinstalling network adapters, checking adapter settings, and so on. But for the 
average end users on a Windows To Go drive, perhaps the best place for them to start is to 
run the available Windows troubleshooters. 
 If problems arise with a network, users can access the troubleshooting wizards 
available by clicking Troubleshoot problems as shown in Figure  7-23 . There, users can 
select from the following options. They can let Windows automatically troubleshoot:
• 
 Internet Connections 
• 
 Shared Folders 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
134
• 
 HomeGroup 
• 
 Network Adapter 
• 
 Incoming Connections 
• 
 Connections to a Workplace using DirectAccess    
 If running a wizard doesn’t resolve the problem a user can click Change adapter 
settings to view more about the connected network (which they might discover is sending 
data but not receiving it, or vice versa). As you can see in Figure  7-24 , a user might see lots 
of networks. 
 Figure 7-24.    Adapters are available by clicking Change adapter settings in the Network 
and Sharing Center 
 Here there’s a virtual private network, a wireless network, Bluetooth options, and 
even Ethernet options. There’s also a Hyper-V adapter available. Users can right-click any 
network to connect or disconnect. Users can also click Properties to access additional 
information, such as their IP address or gateway. 
 Accounts 
 You saw earlier where you can access account options in Settings. I didn’t go into much 
detail about account options there though. For the most part, with Windows To Go 
workspaces, users will use one of three account types: Local, Microsoft, and Domain. 
 A local account is an account that is only associated with the Windows To Go drive. 
The user profile is stored on the drive, and the profile exists only when the drive is in 
use. You can create a local account by clicking Start, Settings, Accounts, and then Your 
email and accounts. Figure  7-25 shows that I’m connected to this drive with a Microsoft 
account; thus, the option to sign in with a local account instead exists. To create a local 
account or switch to an existing one, click this link. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ WINDOWS 10 FOR BUSINESS
135
 Figure 7-25.  Switch accounts using the Accounts area of Settings 
 As you might expect, if you’re signed in with a local account already the option to 
switch to one changes. (You can create additional local accounts as well.) It changes to 
Sign in with a Microsoft Account instead. A Microsoft account is another way to sign in. 
When you sign in with this kind of account you can access OneDrive from inside File 
Explorer, and your user profile is stored in the cloud. This means that as you log on to any 
other machine directly using the account, your profile follows you and is applied. This 
makes all of your computing sessions the same, because the user account is what applies 
settings like background, privacy, and so on each time you log on. 
 Finally, there’s a domain account. You’ll use a domain account to connect to 
your enterprise network. Users won’t have much control over that account or settings 
associated with it; a domain administrator manages the account in the enterprise. 
Group Polices are applied when the user logs on too, and they often prevent the user 
from accessing or modifying system settings like the Firewall or Windows Defender, and 
Windows Updates, and might even prevent them from changing thing like screensavers 
and backgrounds. 
 File Explorer 
 File Explorer hasn’t changed much over the years, except for the addition of the Ribbon 
and a link to OneDrive. Users might be thrown a little when they find out they can’t right-
click the Start button to get to it, but it’s easy enough to access by clicking Start with the 
left mouse button. File Explorer can look like what’s shown in Figure  7-26 on first use, but 
if you expand your favorite sections it’ll look more like what’s shown in  7-27 . Teach your 
users how to get the most from File Explorer by teaching them this trick. I especially like 
Quick Access, as it offers links to the folders I use most often.

 If users incorporate OneDrive, iCloud, or Google Drive to store their documents, 
inform them there are links in File Explorer that work just like local folders. You can work 
inside these folders just like you would with any folder that’s stored on the Windows To 
Go drive, and you can use the ribbon to do it. Make sure you let your users know that 
it’s important to save any data they create using their Windows To Go drive either to the 
cloud or to a domain or local network share. 
 Summary 
 Windows 10 is quite a bit different from Windows 7 or 8/8.1 and it’s important your users 
know about these changes prior to giving them a Windows To Go workspace. Make sure 
they know how to connect to networks, change personal settings, and use File Explorer 
so they can get the most possible out of their drive. Also let them know that Windows 10 
is meant to unify desktop PCs, Windows tablets, and Windows smartphones with one 
interface, using one account and one operating system.
