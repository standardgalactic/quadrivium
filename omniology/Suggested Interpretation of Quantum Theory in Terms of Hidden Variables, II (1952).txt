A Suggested
Interpretation
of the Quantum

I'Received July 5, 1951)
In this paper, we shall show how the theory of measurements
is
to be understood
from the point of view of a physical
interpreta-
tion
of the
quantum
theory
in terms
of
hidden
variables
developed
in a previous
paper. We find that in principle,
these
"hidden" variables determine
the precise results of each individual
measurement
process.
In practice,
however,
in
measurements
that
we now know
how to carry out, the observing
apparatus
disturbs
the observed
system
in an unpredictable
and
uncon-
trollable
way, so that the uncertainty
principle
is obtained
as a
practical
limitation
on the possible
precision
of measurements.
This limitation
is not, however,
inherent
in the conceptual
struc-
ture of our interpretation.
We shall see, for example, that simul-
taneous
measurements
of position
and
momentum
having
un-
limited
precision would in principle
be possible if, as suggested
in
the previous paper, the mathematical
formulation
of the quantum
theory
needs to be modined
at very short distances
in certain
ways that are consistent
with our interpretation
but not with the
usual interpretation.
We give a simple explanation
of the origin of quantum-mechan-
ical correlations
of distant objects in the hypothetical
experiment
of Einstein,
Podolsky,
and Rosen, which was suggested
by these
authors
as a criticism of the usual interpretation.
Finally,
we show
that
von
Neumann's
proof that
quantum
theory is not consistent
with hidden
variables
does not apply to
our interpretation,
because
the hidden
variables
contemplated
here depend
both on the state of the measuring
apparatus
and
the
observed
system
and
therefore
go beyond
certain
of von
¹umann's
assumptions.
In two appendixes,
we treat the problem oi the electromagnetic
field in our interpretation
and answer certain additional
objections
which have arisen in the attempt
to give a precise description
for
an individual
system at the quantum
level.
1. INTRODUCTION
' 'N a previous paper, ' to which we shall hereafter refer
~ - as I, we have
suggested
an interpretation
of the
quantum
theory
in terms
of "hidden"
variables,
We
have shown that although
this interpretation
provides
a conceptual
framework
that is broader
than that of
the usual
interpretation,
it permits
of a set of three
mutually
consistent
special assumptions,
which lead to
the
same
physical
results
as are obtained
from
the
usual
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory.
These
three special assumptions
are: (1) The P-field satisfies
Schroedinger's
equation. (2) U we write it =Eexp(is/5),
then the particle momentum
is restricted
to y= VS(x).
(3) We have a statistical
ensemble
of particle positions,
with a probability
density, I'= ~P(x) ~'. lf the
a,bove
three
special
assumptions
are not
made,
then
one
obtains
a more
general
theory
that
cannot
be made
consistent
with
the usual
interpretation.
It was sug-
gested in Paper I that such generalizations
may actually
be needed for an understanding
of phenomena
associ-
ated with distances
of the order of 10 "cm or less, but
may produce
changes
of negligible
importance
in the
atoInlc domain.
In this paper,
we shall
apply
the interpretation
of
the quantum
theory
suggested
in Paper I to the de-
velopment
of a theory of measurements
in order to show
that
as long
as one makes
the
special
assumptions
indicated
above, one is led to the same predictions
for
all measurements
as are obtained
from the usual inter-
pretation.
In our interpretation,
however,
the uncer-
tainty principle
is regarded,
not as an inherent
limita-
tion
on the
precision
with
which
we
can
correctly
conceive of the simultaneous
definition
of momentum
and position, but rather as a practical limitation
on the

precision
with
which
these
quantities
can simultane-
ously
be measured,
arising
from
unpredictable
and
uncontrollable
disturbances
of the observed
system by
the measuring
apparatus.
If the theory
needs
to be
generalized
in the ways suggested
in Paper I, Secs. 4
and
9, however,
then
these
disturbances
could
in
principle
either be eliminated,
or else be made subject
to prediction
and control, so that their e6ects could be
corrected for. Our interpretation
therefore demonstrates
that measurements
violating
the uncertainty
principle
are at least conceivable.
2. QUANTUM
THEORY OF MEASUREMENTS
We shall
now
show
how
the
quantum
theory
of
measurements
is to
be
expressed
in
terms
of our
suggested
interpretation
of the quantum
theory. '
In general,
a measurement
of any
variable
must
always be carried out by means of an interaction
of the
system
of interest
with a suitable
piece of measuring
apparatus.
The apparatus
must be so constructed
that
any given state of the system of interest
will lead to a
certain
range
of states
of the apparatus.
Thus,
the
interaction
introduces
correlations
between
the state
of the observed
system and the state of the apparatus.
The range of inde6niteness
in this correlation
may be
called the uncertainty,
or the error, in the measurement.
Let us
now
consider
an
observation
designed
to
measure
an
arbitrary
(hermitian)
"observable"
Q,
associated with an electron. Let x represent
the position
of the
electron,
y that
of the
significant
apparatus
coordinate
(or coordinates
if there are more than one).
Now,
one can show'
that it is enough
to consider
an
impulsive
measurement,
i.e., a measurement
utilizing
a
very strong interaction
between
apparatus
and system

of how the theory
of measurements
can be
carried out with the usual interpretation,

R time that

can be neglected. Thus, at least while the
interaction
is taking place, me can neglect the parts of
thc Hamiltonian
RssoclRtcd with
thc RppRrRtus
Rlonc
and with the observed system alone, and we need retain
only the part of the Hamiltonian,
HI, representing
the
interaction.
Moreover,
if the Hamiltonian
operator
is
chosen to bc R function only of qURntltlcs
thRt commute
with
Q, then
the interaction
process
will produce
no
uncontrollable
changes in the observable,
Q, but only in
observables
that do not commute
with Q. In order that
the apparatus
and the system
under
observation
shall
be coupled,
however,
it is necessary
tha, t BI shall also
dcpcnd on operators
involving
y.
For the sake of illustration
of the principles
involved,
we shall consider the following interaction
Hamiltonian:
Hl
—aQp„—

(1)
where a is a suitable constant
and p„ is the momentum
conjugate to y.
Now, in our interpretation,
the system
is to be de-
scribed by a four-dimensional
but objectively real wave
field that is a, function of x a.nd y and by a, corresponding
four-dimensional
representative
point, specihed by the
coordinates,
x, of the electron and the coordinate,
y, of
the apparatus.
Since the motion
of the representative
point is in part determined.

Equation
(8) indicates
already
that the interaction
has introduced
a correlation
between
q and the appa-
ratus coordinate,
y. In order to show what this corre-
lation
means
in
our
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory,
we sha, ll use some arguments
that have been
developed
in more detail in Paper I, Sec. 7, in connection
with a similar problem
involving
the interaction
of two
pRx'tlclcs
ln
R scat tcx'lng
pl occss. Flx'st
%'c note that
while
the electron
and the apparatus
are interacting,
the wave
function
(8) becomes
very
complicated,
so
that if it is expressed as
4'(x, y, t)=R(x, y, t) CxpLiS(x, y, t)/A j;
then E and 5 undergo

that the "quantum-mechanical"

where R is

and that the particle momenta,
y= V',S(x, y, t)
and p„=8S(x, y, t)/By,
also
undergo
corresponding
vlolcnt
Rnd extremely
complicated
Quctuations.
Even-
tually,
however,
if
the
interaction
continues
long
enough,
the behavior of the system
mill become simpler
because
the packets
go(y—aqt/It' ), corresponding
to
diGerent
values of g, will cease to overlap
in y space.
To prove
this,
wc note that
the
center
of the
qth
packet in y space is at
y= aqt/f'I';
or
q= Py/at.
If wc denote the separation
of adjacent values
of g
by bq, wc then obtain for the separation
of the centers
of adjacent packets in y space
by= atbq/5'.
It is clear that
if the product
of thc strength
of
interaction
u, and the dux'a, tion of interaction,
$, is large
enough,
then
by can be made
much
larger
than
the

values of q will cease to overlap

Because the probability
density
is equal to
~ 4'~', we
deduce
that
the apparatus
variable,
y, must
6nally
enter one of the packets and remain
with that packet
thereafter
(since it does not
enter
the
intermediate
space between packets in which the probability
density
is practically
zero). Now,
the packet
entered
by the
apparatus
variable y determines
the actual result of the
measurement,
which the observer
will obtain when
he
looks at the
apparatus.
The
other
packets
can
(as
shown
in Paper I, Sec. 7) be ignored,
because
they
RQect neither the quantum-mechanical
potential
acting
on the particle
coordinates
x and y, nor the particle
mornenta,
p,=V'Q
and p„=BS/By.
Moreover,
the
wave function
can also be renormalized
without
RGect-
ing any of the above quantities.
Thus, for all practical
purposes,
we can replace the complete
wave function,
Eq. (8), by a new renormalized
wave function
+(», y) =4.(x)gp(y —as~/&'),
where
q now corresponds
to the packet actually
con-
taining
the
apparatus
variable,
y. From
this
wave
function,
we can deduce, as shown
in Paper I, Sec. 7,
that the apparatus
and the electron
will subsequently
behave
independently.
Moreover,
by
observing
the
approximate
value of the apparatus
coordinate
within
an error hy((By, we can deduce with the aid of Eq. (9)
that

lf the
product,

in Eqs. (8), (9), (10),

ment of Q would
have been possible,
because packets
corresponding
to di6'crent
q would
have
overlapped,
and the measureDIent
would not have had the requisite
RccurRey.
Finally,
we note that even if the apparatus
packets
are
subsequently
caused
to overlap,
none
of those
conclusions
will be altered. For the apparatus

As
shown
in Paper I, Sec. 7, interference
between
packets corresponding
to diGerent values of q would be
possible
only if the packets overlapped
in the space of
y~, y~,
y„as well as in y space. Such an overlap,
however, is so improbable
that for all practical purposes,
we can ignore the possibility
that it will
CV'er occur.
3. THE ROLE OF PROBABILITY IN MEASUREMENTS-
THE UNCERTAINTY
PRINCIPLE
In principle,
the final
result
of a measurement
is
determined
by the initial form of the wave function
of

is obtained
in the usual interpretation.
See reference 2, Chapter 22, Sec. 8.
the combined
system, 4 (x, y), and by the initial posi-
tion
of the
electron
particle,
xo, and
the apparatus
variable,
yo. In practice, however,
as we have seen, the
orbit Quetuates
violently
while interaction
takes place,
and is very sensitive
to the precise initial
values
of x
and y, which
we can neither
predict
nor control.
All
that we ean predict in practice is that in an ensemble of
similar
experiments
performed
under
equivalent
initial
conditions,
the probability
density
is
~ +(x, y)
~ . From
this information,
however,
we are able to calculate only
the probability
that
in an individual
experiment,
the
result of a measurement
of Q will be a specific number
q. To obtain the probability
of a given value of q', we
need only integrate
the above probability
density
over
all x and over all values of y in the neighborhood
of the
qth packet. Because the packets
do not overlap,
the
0'-field
in this region
is equal
to c,f,(x)g (ypaid/I'IP—)
[see Eq. (8)].Since, by definition,
P,(x) and gp(y) are
normalized,
the total probability
that a particle
is in
the qth packet is
The above is, however,
just what
is obtained
from
the usual
interpretation.
%e conclude
then
that
our
interpretation
is capable
of leading
in
all
possible
experiments
to identical predictions
with those obtained
from the usual interpretation
(provided,
or course, that
we
make
the
special
assumptions
indicated
in
the
introduction).
Let us now see what a measurement
of the observable,
Q, implies
with
regard
to the state
of the
electron
particle and its 0'-6eld. First, we note that the process
of interaction
with an apparatus
designed
to measure
the observable,
Q, effectively
transforms
the electron

It WRS bcfolc tlic IilcRslilciIlcllt
took place into an eigenfunction f,(x) of the operator
Q. The precise value of q that comes out of this process
is as we have
seen, not,
in general,
completely
pre-
dictable or controllable. If, however,
the same measure-
ment is repeated after the tP-field has been transformed
into P,(x), we can then predict
that
(as in the usua, l
interpretation),
the same value of g, and therefore
the
same wave function,
iP,(x), will be obtained
again. If,
however,
we measure
an observable "I'"that does not
commute
with Q, then the results of this measurement
are not, in practice, predictable
or controllable.
For as
shown in Eq. (8), the 4'-field after interaction
with the
measuring
apparatus
is now transformed
into
+(», », &)=Z.a.,.4.(x)gp(» —ap&/&'),
(»)
where
p~(x) is an eigenfunction
of the operator,
I',
belonging
to an eigenvalue,
p, and
where
a~, , is an
expansion
coefficient defined by
0.(x)=Z. a.,.4 n(x)
Since the packets
corresponding
to different
p ulti-
mately
become
completely
separate
in s space,
we
deduce,
as in the case of the measurement
of Q, that

for all practical
purposes,
this wave function
may be
replaced by
@=a~,y„(x)gp(s
aPt/—A'),
where p now represents
the packet actually
entered by
the apparatus
coordinate,
y. As in the case of measure-
ment of Q, we readily
show that the precise value of p
that comes out of this experiment
cannot be predicted
or controlled
and that the probability
of a given value
of p is equal to
~ a„,~ . This is, however,
just what is
obtained
in the usual interpretation
of this process.
It is clear that if two "observables, "P and Q, do not
commute,
one cannot carry out a measurement
of both
simultaneously
on the same system. The reason is that
each measurement
disturbs
the system
in a way that is
incompatible
with
carrying
out the process necessary
for the measurement
of the other. Thus, a measurement
of P requires
that
wave
field,
P,
shall
become
an
eigenfunction
of P, while a measurement
of Q requires
that it shall become an eigenfunction
of Q. If P and Q
do not commute,
then by definition,
no f-function
can
be simultaneously
an eigenfunction
of both. In this
way, we understand
in our interpretation
why measure-
ments,
of complementary
quantities,
must
(as in the
usual
interpretation)
necessarily
be limited
in
their
precision by the uncertainty
principle.
4. PARTICLE POSITIONS
AND
MOMENTA
AS
"HIDDEN VARIABLES"
We have seen that in measurements
that can now be
carried
out, we cannot
make precise inferences
about
the particle position, but can say only that the particle
must
be
somewhere
in
the
region
in
which
~f~
is
appreciable.
Similarly,
the momentum
of a particle that
happens
to be at the point, x, is given by p= Vs(x), so
that since x is not known,
the precise value of p is also
not, in general,
inferrable.
Hence,
as long
as we are
restricted
to making
observations
of this
kind,
the
precise values
of the particle position
and momentum
must,
in general,
be regarded
as "hidden, " since we
cannot at present
measure
them. They are, however,
connected
with real and already
observable
properties
of matter
because
(along with the f-Geld) they deter-
mine
in principle
the actual
result
of each individual
measurement.
By way of contrast,
we recall here that
in the usual
interpretation
of the theory, it is stated
that although
each measurement
admittedly
leads to a
definite
number,
nothing
determines
the actual
value
of this
number.
The result
of each measurement
is
assumed
to arise somehow
in an inherently
indescrib-
able way that
is not subject
to a detailed
analysis.
Only the statistical
results
are said to be predictable.
In our interpretation,
however,
we assert that the at
present
"hidden" precisely
definable
particle
positions
and momenta
determine
the results of each individual
measurement
process,
but
in a way
whose
precise
details are so complicated
and uncontrollable,
and so
little known,
that one must for all practical
purposes
restrict oneself to a statistical description
of the connec-
tion
between
the
values
of these
variables
and
the
directly
observable
results
of measurements.
Thus, we
are unable
at present
to obtain
direct
experimental
evidence for the existence of precisely de6nable particle
positions
and momenta.
5. "OBSERVABLES"OF USUAL INTERPRETATION
ARE
NOT A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION
OF SYSTEM
IN OUR INTERPRETATION
We have seen in Sec. 3 that in the measurement
of
an "observable, " Q, we cannot obtain enough
informa-
tion to provide a complete
specification
of the state of
an
electron,
because
we
cannot
infer
the
precisely
defined values of the particle momentum
and position,
which
are, for example,
needed
if we wish
to make
precise
predictions
about
the future
behavior
of the
electron.
Moreover,
the process
of measuring
an ob-
servable does not provide any unambiguous
information
about
the state that
existed
before the measurement
took place; for in such a measurement,
the f-Geld is
transformed
into
an
in practice
unpredictable
and
uncontrollable
eigenfunction,
P,(x), of the
measured
"observable"
Q. This means
that the measurement
of
an "observable"
is not really
a measurement
of any
physical
property
belonging
to the
observed
system
alone. Instead,
the value of an "observable"
measures
only
an
incompletely
predictable
and
controllable
potentiality
belonging
just as much to the measuring
apparatus
as to the observed
system
itself. 4 At best,
such a measurement
provides unambiguous
information
only at a classical level of accuracy,
where the distur-
bance of the f-field by the measuring
apparatus
can be
neglected.
The usual
"observables"
are therefore
not
what we ought to try to measure at a quantum
level of
accuracy. In Sec. 6, we shall see that it is conceivable
that we may be able to carry out new kinds of measure-
ments, providing
information
not about "observables"
having a very ambiguous
significance, but rather about
physically
signihcant
properties
of a system, such as the
actual values of the particle position and momentum.
As an example
of the rather indirect and ambiguous
significance
of the "observable, " we may consider
the
problem
of measuring
the momentum
of an electron.
Now, in the usual interpretation,
it is stated that one
can
always
measure
the
momentum
"observable"
without
changing
the value
of the momentum.
The
result
is said, for example,
to be obtainable
with
the
aid of an impulsive
interaction
involving
only operators
which
commute
with the momentum
operator,
p . To
represent
such
a
measurement,
we
could
choose
H&
—ap,p„ in Eq. (I)—
.—In our interpretation,
however,
we cannot in general
conclude that such an interaction
will enable us to measure

interpretation,

with a probability
~a~~
that a given
value of P, will
be obtained.
When
the f-field
is altered
in this way,
large quantities
of momentum
can be transferred
to the
particle
by
the
changing
f-fiel,
even
though
the
interaction
Hamiltonian,
H~, commutes
with the mo-
mentum
operator,
p.
As an example,
we may consider a stationary
state
of an atom, of zero angular
momentum.
As shown
in
Paper I, Sec. 5, the f-field for such a state is real, so
that we obtain
y= v'5=0.
Thus, the particle is at rest. Nevertheless,
we see from
Eqs. (14) and (15) that if the momentum
"observable"
is measured,
a large value of this "observable" may be
obtained
if the P-field happens
to have a large fourier
coeKcient, a~, for a high value of p. The reason is that
in the process of interaction
with the measuring
appa-
ratus,
the P-field is altered
in such a way that it can
give
the
electron
particle
a
correspondingly
large
momentum,
thus
transforming
some of the potential
energy of interaction
of the particle with its g-field into
kinetic energy.
A more striking
illustration
of the points
discussed
above is aGorded
by the problem
of a "free" particle
contained
between
two
impenetrable
and
perfectly
reQecting
walls,
separated
by a distance I.. For this
case, the spatial part of the P-field is
f= sin(2m. ex/1.),
where e is an integer and the energy of the electron is
E= (1/2m) (nh/L, )'.
Because the f-field is real, we deduce that the particle
is at rest.
Now, at erst
sight,
it may
seem
puzzling
that a
particle
having
a high energy
should
be at rest in the
empty space between
two walls. Let us recall, however,
that
the space is not really
empty,
but contains
an
objectively
real f-field
that
can act on the particle.
Such
an action
is analogous
to (but
of course
not
identical
with)
the action of an electromagnetic
field,
which could create non-uniform
motion of the particle
in this apparently
"empty" enclosure. We observe that
in our problem,
the P-field is able to bring the particle
to rest and to transform
the entire kinetic energy into
tion, a measurement
of particle
momentum
that does
not
change
the value
of this
momentum
is possible
only
if the
P-field
initially
takes
the
special
form,
exp(iy x/5). If, however,
P initially
takes
its most
general possible form,
P=P„giy exp(ip x/Ii),
(15)
then as we have seen in Secs. 2 and 3, the process of
measuring
the "observable" p, will
effectively
trans-
form the f-field of the electron into
potential
energy
of interaction
with
the
P-field. To
prove
this,
we
evaluate
the
"quantum-mechanical
potential" for this f-field
—O'V'R
—5'PP
1 (eh~'
U=
2m
R
2m f
2m(1)
and note that it is precisely equal to the total energy, E.
Now,
as we have
seen,
any
measurement
of the
momentum
"observable"
must
change
the f-field
in
such a way that in general
some (and in our case, all)
of this
potential
energy
is transformed
into
kinetic
energy. We may use as an illustration
of this general
result a very simple
specific method
of measuring
the
momentum
"observable, " namely,
to remove
the con-
6ning walls suddenly
and then to measure
the distance
moved by the particle after a fairly long time. We can
compute
the momentum
by dividing
this distance
by
the time of transit. If (as'in the usual interpretation
of
the quantum
theory)
we assume
that
the electron
is
"free," then we conclude that the process of removing
the walls should not appreciably
change the momentum
if we do it fast enough,
for the probability
that
the
particle
is near a wall when
this happens
can then in
principle
be made arbitrarily
small. In our interpreta-
tion,
however,
the
removal
of the
walls
alters
the
particle
momentum
indirectly,
because of its effect on
the f-field, which acts on the particle. Thus, after the
walls are removed,
two wave packets moving in opposite
directions
begin to form, and ultimately
they become
completely
separate
in space. Because the probability
density
is ~f~', we deduce that the particle
must
end
up in one packet or the other.
Moreover,
the reader
will readily
convince himself that the particle momen-
tum
will be very close to &eh/I,
the sign depending
on which
packet
the particle
actually
enters.
As in
Sec. (2), the packet not containing
the particle
can
subsequently
be ignored. In principle,
the Anal particle
momentum
is determined
by the initial
form
of the
g-field and by the initial particle position. Since we do
not in practice know the latter, we can at best predict
a probability
of
—, that the particle
ends up in either
packet. We conclude
then
that
this measurement
of
the momentum
"observable"
leads to the same result
as is predicted
in the usual
interpretation.
However,
the
actual
particle
momentum
existing
befog
the
measurement
took place
is quite
diferent
from
the
numerical
value
obtained
for
the
momentum
"ob-
servable, " which,
in the usual interpretation,
is called
the "momentum. "
6. ON THE POSSIBILITY OF MEASUREMENTS
OF UNLIMITED
PRECISION
We have
seen that
the so-called
"observables"
do
not measure
any very readily
interpretable
properties
of a system. For example,
the momentum
"observable"
has in general
no simple relation
to the actual particle
momentum.
It may
therefore
be fruitful
to consider

QUANTUM
THEORY
IN
TERMS
how we might try to measure
properties
which, accord-
ing to our interpretation,
are (along with the P-field) the
physically
significant
properties
of an electron, namely,
the actual
particle
position
and
momentum.
In con-
nection
with
this problem,
we shall
show
that
if, as
suggested
in Paper I, Secs. 4 and 9, we give up the
three mutually
consistent
special assumptions
leading
to the same results as those of the usual interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
then in our interpretation,
the
particle
position
and
momentum
can in principle
be
measured
simultaneously
with unlimited
precision.
Now, for our purposes,
it will be adequate
to show
that
precise
predictions
of the future
behavior
of a
system are in principle
possible. In our interpretation,
a sufficient
condition
for precise predictions
is as we
have seen that we shall be able to prepare
a system
in
a state
in which
the
P-field
and
the
initial
particle
position and momentum
are precisely
known. We have
shown
that it is possible,
by measuring
the "observ-
able, "Q, with the aid of methods that are now available,
to prepare
a state in which
the
lt-Geld
is effectively
transformed
into a known. form, P,(x); but we cannot
in general
predict
or control
the precise position
and
momentum
of the particle. If we could now measure
the position
and
momentum
of the particle
without
altering
the P-field,
then precise predictions
would
be
possible. However,
the results of Secs, 2, 3, and 4 prove
that as long as the three special assumptions
indicated
above are valid, we cannot measure the particle position
more accurately
without
effectively
transforming
the
f-function
into an incompletely
predictable
and con-
trollable
packet
that
is much
more
localized
than
f,(x). Thus, efforts to obtain more precise definition
of
the state of the system
will be defeated. But it is clear
that the difhculty
originates
in the circumstance
that
the potential
energy
of interaction
between
electron
and apparatus,
V(x, y), plays two roles. For it not only
introduces
a direct interaction
between
the two parti-
cles, proportional
in strength
to V(x, y) itself, but it
introduces
an indirect interaction
between
these parti-
cles, because this potential
also appears in the equation
governing
the f-field.
This
indirect
interaction
may
involve
rapid
and
violent
fluctuations,
even
when
V(x, y) is small. Thus, we are led to lose control of the
eGects of this interaction,
because no matter how small
V(x, y)
is,
very
large
and
chaotically
complicated
disturbances
in the particle motion may occur.
If, however,
we give up the three special assumptions
mentioned
previously,
then it is not inherent
in our
conceptual
structure
that
every
interaction
between
particles must inevitably
also produce large and uncoD-
trollable
changes
in the f-field. Thus, in Paper I, Eq.
(31), we
give
an
example
in which
we postulate
a
force acting on a particle that is. not necessarily
accom-
panied
by
a
corresponding
change
in
the
f-field.
Equation
(31), Paper I, is concerned
only with a one-
particle
system,
but similar
assumptions
can be made
for systems of two or more particles. In the absence of
any
specific
theory,
our
interpretation
permits
an
infinite
number
of kinds of such modifications,
which
can be chosen to be important
at small distances
but
negligible
in the atomic domain. For the sake of illus-
tration,
suppose that it should
turn out that in certain
processes
connected
with
very
small
distances,
the
force acting on the apparatus
variable
is
where a is a constant. Now if "u" is made large enough
so that the interaction
is impulsive,
we can neglect all
changes in y that are brought
about by the forces that
would have been present in the absence of this interac-
tion.
Moreover,
for the
sake
of illustration
of the
principles
involved,
we
are permitted
to make
the
assumption,
consistent
with
our interpretation,
that
the
force on
the
electron
is zero. The
equation
of
motion of y is then
The solution
is
y—yo —
—(axt2/2m)+ jot,
where jo is the initial velocity of the apparatus
variable
and
yo its initial position.
Now, if the product, at, is
large
enough,
then
y—yo can be made
much
larger
than the uncertainty
in y arising
from the uncertainty
of yo, and the uncertainty
of j'0. Thus,
y—yo will be
determined
primarily
by the particle
position,
x. In
this
way,
it is conceivable
that
we
could
obtain
a
measurement
of x that
does not significantly
change
x, x, or the P-function.
The particle
momentum
can
then
be obtained
from
the relation, p= V'5(x), where
S/jt
is the
phase
of the
P-function.
Thus,
precise
predictions
would in principle
be possible.
'7. THE ORIGIN OF THE STATISTICAL ENSEMBLE IN
THE QUANTUM
THEORY
We shall now see that even if, because of a failure of
the three special assumptions
mentioned
in Secs. 1 and
6, we are able to determine
the particle positions
and
momenta
precisely,
we
shall
nevertheless
ultimately
obtain a statistical
ensemble
again at the atomic level,
with a probability
density
equal to
~ P~'. The need for
such an ensemble
arises from the chaotically
compli-
cated character
of the coupling
between
the electron
and classical systems,
such as volumes
of gas, walls of
containers,
pieces of measuring
apparatus,
etc., with
which this particle must inevitably
in practice interact.
For as we have seen in Sec. 2, and in Paper I, Sec. 7,
during the course of such an interaction,
the "quantum-
mechanical"
potential
undergoes
violent
and
rapid
fluctuations,
which
tend
to make
the particle
orbit
wander
over the whole
region
in which
the P-field
is
appreciable.
Moreover,
these Quctuations
are further
complicated
by the eGects of molecular
chaos in the
very large number
of internal
thermodynamic
degrees
of freedom
of these
classically
describable
systems,
which are inevitably
excited in any interaction
process.

Thus,
even if the initial
particle
variables
were
well
dined,
we should
soon in practice lose all possibility
of following
the particle motion and would be forced to
have recourse to some kind of statistical
theory. The
only question
that remains
is to show why the proba-
bility
density
that ultimately
comes about
should
be
equal to
~ P
~ ' and not to some other quantity.
To answer this question,
we first note that a statistical
ensemble
with
a probability
density
~P(x) ~' has the
property
that under
the action of forces which prevail
at the atomic level, where our three special assumptions
are satisfied,
it will be preserved
by the equations
of
motion
of the particles,
once it comes into existence.
There
remains
only
the problem
of showing
that
an
arbitrary
deviation
from this ensemble
tends, under the
action of the chaotically
complicated
forces described
in the previous
paragraph,
to decay into an ensemble
with a probability
density
of
~ P(x) ~'. This problem
is
very similar to that of proving Boltzmann's
H theorem,
which
shows in connection
with a diferent
but analo-
gous problem
that
an arbitrary
ensemble
tends
as a
result of molecular
chaos to decay into
a,n equilibrium
Gibbs
ensemble.
We shall
not carry
out a detailed
proof here, but we merely suggest that it seems plausible
that
one could
along
similar
lines prove
that
in our
problem,
an arbitrary
ensemble
tends to decay into an
ensemble
with a density
of ~P(x) ~'. These arguments
indicate
that
in our interpretation,
quantum
Quctua-
tions and classical Quctuations
(such as the Brownian
motion)
have basically
the same origin; iiz., the cha-
otically complicated
character
of motion at the micro-
scopic level.
P= b(xi

In the
usual
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory,
pi—
p& and xi+x2 are completely
undetermined
in a
system having
the above wave function.
The whole
experiment
centers
on the fact that an
observer has a choice of measuring
either the momentum
or the position of any one of the two particles. Which-
ever of these quantities
he measures,
he will be able to
infer a definite
value of the corresponding
variable
in
the other particle,
because of the fact that the above
wave
function
implies
correlations
between
variables
belonging
to each particle. Thus, if he obtains a position
xj for the
first particle,
he can infer
a position
of
' Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, Phys. Rev. 47, 777 (1933).
8. THE HYPOTHETICAL
EXPERIMENT OF EINSTEIN,
PODOLSKY, AND ROSEN
The hypothetical
experiment
of Einstein,
Podolsky,
and Rosen' is based on the fact that if we have two
particles,
the sum of their momenta, p= pi+p2, com-
mutes with the difference
of their positions, )=xi—x~.
We can therefore
define a wave function
in which p is
zero, while
$ has a given value, a. Such a wave function
is
x2 ——a—xj for the
second
particle;
but
he
loses
all
possibility of making any inferences about the momenta
of either particle.
On the other hand,
if he measures
the momentum
of the first particle and obtains a value
of pi, he can infer a value of p2 —
——pi for the momentum
of the second particle;
but he loses all possibility
of
making
any
inferences
about
the position
of either
particle.
Now, Einstein,
Podolsky,
and Rosen believe
that this result
is itself probably
correct, but they do
not believe that quantum
theory as usually
interpreted
can give a complete description
of how these correlations
are propagated.
Thus, if these were classical particles,
we could easily understand
the propagation
of correla-
tions because
each particle
would
then
simply
move
with a velocity
opposite
to that of the other. But in
the usual interpretation
of quantum
theory, there is no
similar
conceptual
model
showing
in detail
how
the
second particle,
which
is not in any way supposed
to
interact
with
the first particle,
is nevertheless
able to
obtain either an uncontrollable
disturbance
of its posi-
tion or an uncontrollable
disturbance
of its momentum
depending
on what kind of measurement
the observer
decided to carry out on the erst particle. Bohr's point
of view
is, however,
that
no such
model
should
be
sought and that we should merely accept the fact that
these correlations
somehow
manage to appear. We must
note, of course, that the quantum-mechanical
descrip-
tion of these processes
will always
be consistent,
even
though
it gives
us no precisely
definable
means
of
describing
and analyzing
the relationships
between
the
classically
describable
phenomena
appearing
in various
pieces of measuring
apparatus.
In our suggested
new interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
however,
we can describe
this experiment
in
terms of a single precisely
de6nable
conceptual
model,
for we now describe
the system
in terms of a combi-
nation
of a six-dimensional
wave field and a precisely
definable
trajectory
in a six-dimensional
space
(see
Paper I, Sec. 6). If the wave function
is initially
equal
to Eq. (17), then. since the phase vanishes,
the particles
are both at rest. Their possible positions are, however,
described
by an ensemble,
in which
xi—x2=a. Now,
if we measure
the position
of the first particle,
we
introduce
uncontrollable
fluctuations
in
the
wave
function
for the
entire
system,
which,
through
the
"quantum-mechanical"
forces, bring about correspond-
ing
uncontrollable
fluctuations
in the momentum
of
each particle. Similarly,
if we measure
the momentum
of the first particle,
uncontrollable
Quctuations
in the
wave function for the system bring about, through
the
"quantum-mechanical"
forces,
corresponding
uncon-
trollable
changes
in the position
Of each particle. Thus,
the
"quantum-mechanical"
forces
may
be
said
to
transmit
uncontrollable
disturbances
instantaneously
from one particle
to another
through
the medium
of
the f-field.
What does this transmission
of forces at an infinite
rate mean? In nonrelativistic
theory, it certainly causes

no diKculties.
In a relativistic
theory,
however,
the
problem is more complicated.
We first note that as long
as the three special assumptions
mentioned
in Sec. 2
are valid, our interpretation
can give rise to no incon-
sistencies
with relativity,
because it leads to precisely
the same predictions
for all physical
processes
as are
obtained
from the usual interpretation
(which is known
to be consistent
with relativity).
The reason
why
no
contradictions
with relativity
arise in our interpretation
despite
the instantaneous
transmission
of momentum
between
particles
is that
no signal
can be carried
in
this way. For such a transmission
of momentum
could
constitute
a signal
only if there
were
some practical
means of determining
precisely what the second particle
mould
have
done
if the first particle
had
not
been
observed; and as we have seen, this information
cannot
be obtained as long as the present form of the quantum
theory is valid. To obtain such information,
we require
conditions
(such as might
perhaps
exist in connection
with distances of the order of 10 "cm) under which the
usual
form of the quantum
theory
breaks
down
(see
Sec. 6), so that
the
positions
and
momenta
of the
particles
can be determined
simultaneously
and pre-
cisely. If such conditions
should
exist, then
there are
two ways
in which
contradictions
might
be avoided.
First, the more
general
physical
laws appropriate
to
the new domains
may be such that they do not permit
the transmission
of controllable
aspects of interparticle
forces faster than light. In this way, Lorentz covariance
could
be preserved.
Secondly,
it is possible
that
the
application
of the usual criteria of Lorentz covariance
may not be appropriate
when the usual interpretation
of quantum
theory
breaks
down. Even in connection
with
gravitational
theory,
general
relativity
indicates
that
the limitation
of speeds to the velocity
of light
does not necessarily
hold universally.
If we adopt the
spirit of general relativity,
which is to seek to make the
properties
of space dependent
on the properties
of the
matter
that moves
in this space, then it is quite con-
ceivable
that
the metric,
and
therefore
the
limiting
velocity,
may depend
on the f-field as well as on the
gravitational
tensor
g&". In the
classical
limit,
the
dependence
on the P-field could be neglected,
and we
would
get the usual
form of covariance.
In any case,
it can hardly be said that we have a solid experimental
basis for requiring
the same form of covariance at very
short distances that we require at ordinary
distances.
To sum up, we may assert that wherever
the present
form of the quantum
theory is correct, our interpreta-
tion cannot
lead to inconsistencies
with relativity.
In
the domains
where
the present
theory
breaks
down,
there are several possible
ways in which
our interpre-
tation could continue to treat the problem of covariance
consistently.
The attempt
to maintain
a consistent
treatment
of covariance
in this problem
might perhaps
serve as an important
heuristic
principle
in the search
for new physical
laws.
9. ON
VON
NEUMANN'S
DEMONSTRATION
THAT
QUANTUM
THEORY IS INCONSISTENT
WITH
HIDDEN VARIABLES
Von Neumann'
has studied
the following
question:
"If the present mathematical
formulation
of the quan-
tum theory and its usual probability
intepretation
are
assumed
to lead to absolutely
correct results for every
experiment
that
can
ever
be
done,
can
quantum-
mechanical
probabilities
be understood
in terms of any
conceivable
distribution
over
hidden
parameters?"
Von Neumann
answers
this question
in the negative.
His conclusions
are subject,
however,
to the criticism
that in his proof he has implicitly
restricted
himself to
an excessively
narrow
class of hidden
parameters
and
in this way has excluded
from consideration
precisely
those
types
of hidden
parameters
which
have
been
proposed
in this paper.
To demonstrate
the above statements,
we summarize
Von Neumann's
proof briefly. This proof (which begins
on p. 167 of his book), shows that the usual
quantum-
mechanical
rules of calculating
probabilities
imply that
there can be no "dispersionless
states, " i.e., states
in
which the values of all possible
observables
are simul-
taneously
determined
by physical parameters
associated
with the observed
system. For example,
if we consider
two
noncommuting
observables,
p and
q, then
Von
Neumann
shows that it would be inconsistent
with the
usual
rules of calculating
quantum-mechanical
proba-
bilities
to assume
that
there
were
in
the
observed
system a set of hidden parameters
which simultaneously
determined
the results of measurements
of position and
momentum
"observables. " With
this
conclusion,
we
are
in
agreement.
However,
in
our
suggested.
new
interpretation
of the
theory„
the
so-called
"observ-
ables" are, as we have
seen in Sec. 5, not properties
belonging
to the observed
system
alone, but instead
potentialities
whose precise development
depends
just
as much on the observing
apparatus
as on the observed
system.
In fact,
when
we
measure
the
momentum
"observable, " the final result
is determined
by hidden
parameters
in the momentum-measuring
device as well
as by
hidden
parameters
in
the
observed
electron,
Similarly,
when we measure
the position "observable, "
the final result is determined
in part by hidden param-
eters in the position-measuring
device. Thus, the sta-
tistical distribution
of "hidden" parameters
to be used
in calculating
averages
in a momentum
measurement
is different
from the distribution
to be used in calcu-
lating
averages
in a position
measurement.
Von Neu-
mann's
proof
(see p. 171 in his book) that no single
distribution
of hidden
parameters
could be consistent
with
the results
of the
quantum
theory
is therefore
irrelevant
here, since in our interpretation
of measure-
ments
of the type that
can now be carried
out, the
distribution
of hidden
parameters
varies in accordance
with
the
different

arrangements

that must be used in making

In this point,
we are
in agreement
with Bohr, who repeatedly
stresses
the
fundamental
role of the
measuring
apparatus
as an
inseparable
part
of the
observed
system.
We differ
from Bohr, however,
in that we have proposed a method
by which
the role of the apparatus
can be analyzed
and described
in principle
in a precise
way,
whereas
Bohr asserts that a precise conception
of the details of
the measurement
process
is as a matter
of principle
unattainable.
Finally,
we wish to stress that the conclusions
drawn
thus far refer only to the measurement
of the so-called
"observables" carried out by the methods that are now
available. If the quantum
theory needs to be modified
at small distances,
then, as suggested
in Sec. 6, precise
measurements
can in principle
be made of the actual
position
and momentum
of a particle. Here, it should
be noted
that
Von
Neumann's
theorem
is likewise
irrelevant,
this time because
we are going beyond
the
assumption
of the
unlimited
validity
of the present
general
form
of
quantum
theory,
which
plays
an
integral part in his proof.
10. SUMMARY
AND
CONCLUSIONS
The
usual
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory
implies
that
we must
renounce
the possibility
of de-
scribing
an
individual
system
in
terms
of a single
precisely
defined conceptual
model. We have, however,
proposed
an alternative
interpretation
which
does not
imply
such a renunciation,
but which instead
leads us
to regard a quantum-mechanical
system as a synthesis
of a precisely dehnable particle and a precisely dehnable
P-6e1d which exerts a force on this particle. An experi-
mental choice between
these two interpretations
cannot
be made in a domain in which the present mathematical
formulation
of the quantum
theory
is a good approxi-
mation;
but such a choice is conceivable
in domains,
such as those associated
with
dimensions
of the order
of l0 " cm, where
the extrapolation
of the present
theory
seems to break down and where
our suggested
new
interpretation
can
lead
to completely
diferent
kinds of predictions.
At present, our suggested
new interpretation
provides
a consistent alternative
to the usual assumption
that no
objective and precisely
de6nable
description
of reality
is possible at the quantum
level of accuracy. For, in
our description,
the problem
of objective reality at the
quantum
level is at least in principle not fundamentally
different
from that at the classical level, although
new
problems
of measurement
of the properties
of an indi-
vidual
system
appear,
which
can be solved
only with
the aid of an improvement
in the theory,
such as the
possible modifications
in the nuclear
domain
suggested
in Sec. 6. In this connection,
we wish to point out that
what we can measure
depends
not only on the type of
apparatus
that
is available,
but also on the existing
theory, which determines
the kind of inference that can
be used to connect the directly
observable
state of the
apparatus
with the state of the system
of interest. In
other words, our epistemology
is determined
to a large
extent by the existing
theory. It is therefore
not wise
to specify the possible forms of future theories in terms
of purely
epistomological
limitations
deduced
from
existing theories.
The development
of the usual
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory
seems
to have
been
guided
to a
considerable
extent by the principle
of not postulating
the possible existence of entities
which
cannot
now be
observed.
This principle,
which
stems from a general
philosophical
point of view known during the nineteenth
century
as "positivism"
or "empiricism"
represents
an
extraphysical
limitation
on the possible kinds of theories
that we shall choose to take into consideration.
~ The
word "extraphysical"
is used here advisedly,
since we
can in no way deduce,
either
from
the experimental
data of physics,
or from its mathematical
formulation,
that it will necessarily
remain forever impossible
for us
to observe
entities
whose
existence
cannot
now
be
observed. Now, there is no reason why an extraphysical
general principle
is necessarily
to be avoided, since such
principles
could
conceivably
serve as useful
working
hypotheses.
The particular
extraphysical
principle
de-
scribed above cannot,
however,
be said to be a good
working hypothesis.
For the history of scientific research
is full of examples
in which it was very fruitful
indeed
to assume
that
certain
objects or elements
might
be
real,
long
before
any
procedures
were
known
which
would permit them to be observed directly. The atomic
theory
is just such an example.
For the possibility
of
the actual existence of individual
atoms was first postu-
lated in order to explain various
macrophysical
results
which
could,
however,
also be understood
directly
in
terms of macrophysical
concepts without
the need for
assuming
the existence
of atoms.
Certain
nineteenth-
century
positivists
(notably
Mach)
therefore
insisted
on purely philosophical
grounds that it was incorrect to
suppose that individual
atoms actually existed, because
they
had
never
been
observed
as such. The atomic
theory,
they
thought,
should
be regarded
only as an
interesting
way of calculating
various observable
large-
scale properties
of matter.
Nevertheless,
evidence
for
the existence
of individual
atoms
was ultimately
dis-
covered
by people
who
took
the
atomic
hypothesis
seriously
enough
to
suppose
that
individual
atoms
might
actually
exist,
even
though
no
one
had
yet
observed
them.
We may have
here, perhaps,
a close
analogy
to the
usual
interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
which
avoids
considering
the possibility
that
the wave function
of an individual
system
may repre-
sent objective
reality,
because
we cannot
observe
it
with the aid of existing experiments
and theories.
A leading
nineteenth-century
exponent
of the positivist
point
of view was Mach. Modern
positivists
appear
to have retreated
from this extreme position,
but its reflection
still remains
in the
philosophical
point of view implicitly
adopted
by a large nu~bep
of modern
theoretical
physicists,

Finally, as an alternative
to the positivist
hypothesis
of assigning
reality
only
to that
which
we can now
observe,
we wish to prevent
here another
hypothesis,
which
we believe
corresponds
more closely to conclu-
sions that
can be drawn
from
general
experience
in
actual
scientific research.
This hypothesis
is based
on
the simple
assumption
that
the
worM
as a whole
is
objectively real and that, as far as we now know, it can
correctly be regarded
as having
a precisely
describable
and analyzable
structure
of unlimited
complexity.
The
pattern
of this structure
seems
to be rejected
com-
pletely
but
indirectly
at every
level,
so that
from
experiments
done at the level of size of human
beings',
it is very probably possible ultimately
to draw inferences
concerning
the properties
of the whole structure
at all
levels. We should
never
expect to obtain
a complete
theory
of this
structure,
because
there
are
almost
certainly
more elements
in existence
than
we possibly
can be aware
of at any particular
stage
of scientific
development.
Any
specified
element,
however,
can in
principle
ultimately
be discovered,
but
never
all of
them.
Of course,
we must
avoid
postulating
a new
element
for each
new
phenomenon.
But an
equally
serious mistake
is to admit into the theory
only those
elements
which can now be observed. For the purpose
of a theory is not only to correlate the results of obser-
vations that we already know how to make, but also to
suggest
the need for new kinds of observations
and to
predict their results. In fact, the better a theory is able
to suggest
the need for new kinds
of observations
and
to predict
their results
correctly,
the more confidence
we have that this theory is likely to be good represen-
tation of the actual properties
of matter and not simply
an empirical
system especially
chosen in such a way as
to correlate a group of already
known facts.

APPENDIX A. PHOTOELECTRIC
AND
COMPTON
EFFECTS
In this
appendix,
we
shall
show
how
the electro-
magnetic
field is to be described
in our new interpre-
tation, with the purpose of making possible a treatment
of the
photoelectric
and
Compton
sects. For our
purposes, it is adequate
to restrict ourselves
to a gauge
in which divA=O,
and to consider
only the transverse
part of the electromagnetic
field, for in this gauge, the
longitudinal
part of the field can be expressed
through
Poisson's
equation
entirely
in
terms
of the
charge
density. The Fourier analysis of the vector potential
is
then
the volume
of the box, which
is assumed
to be very
large.
We
also
introduce
the
momenta
gq, „=Bqq„*/Bt,
canonically
conjugate'
to the
q&, „. We have
for the
transverse
part of the electric field
and for the magnetic
field
@(x)= V&&A=
(47—
r/V) 4+g„(k,X eg, „)qk,„e'"'*. (A3)
Now,
in our interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
the quantity
qz „is assumed to refer to the actual value
of the k, p Fourier component
of the vector potential.
As in the case of the electron, however,
there is present
an objectively
real superfield
that is a function
of all
the electromagnetic
field coordinates

(A6)
The function R(.
qk,„)has
two
interpretations.
First,
it
defines
an
additional
quantum-mechanical
term
appearing
in Maxwell's
equations.
To see the
origin of this term, let us write the generalized
Hamil-
ton-Jacobi equation
of the electromagnetic

Since Maxwell's
equations

space
follow
when
the
right-hand
side
is zero,
we
see that
the
"quantum-mechanical"
terms
can profoundly
modify
the behavior
of the electromagnetic
field. In fact, it is
this modification
which
will contribute
to the explana-

The Hamiltonian
of the radiation
field corresponds

tion of the ability of an oscillator,
gk, » to transfer large
quantities
of energy and momentum
rapidly
even when
qk, „is very small, for when
qk, „is small, the right-hand
side of Eq. (AS) may become very large.
The second interpretation
of E is that as in Paper I,
Eq. (5), it defines a conserved
probability
density
that
each of the
qk, „has a certain
specified
value.
From
this fact, we see that although
large transfers
of energy
and momentum
to a radiation
oscillator can occur in a
short time when R is small,
the probability
of such a
process is (as was also shown
in Paper I, Sec. 7) very
small.
In the lowest
state
(when
no quanta
are present)
every
oscillator
is in
the
ground
state.

In nonstationary
states,
however,
Eqs. (A7)
and (Ag) imply that the energy of each oscillator may
fluctuate
violently,
as was also true of nonstationary
states of the hydrogen
atom (see Paper I, Sec. 7).

interest
in the
photoelectric

We are now
ready
to treat
the photoelectric
and
Compton
effects. The entire treatment
is so similar to
that of the Franck-Hertz
experiment
(Paper I, Sec. 7)
that
we
need
merely
sketch
it here.
We begin
by
adding to the radiation
Hamiltonian,
H(~&, the particle
Hamiltonian,
H(p) = (1/2ni) Lp—(e/c) A(x)]'
(A17)
By solving
Schroedinger's
equation
for the combined
system,
we obtain an asymptotic
wave field analogous
to Paper I, Eq. (26), containing
terms
corresponding
to the photoelectric
effect. These terms,

must
be added
to 4;, to yield the complete
superfield,

an

is

pletely

tion, Pp(x). If the electron happens
to enter the outgoing

wave function
can subsequently
be

as if its wave field were given by Zq. (A9), from which
we conclude
that the radiation

to the matrix

in which
the k, p-radiation
oscillator falls from the erst excited state, to the ground
state,
while
the k', p'-oscillator
rises from the ground
state to the first excited state. This matrix
element
is
determined
mainly
by the term (e'/Smc')2'(x)
in the
hamiltonian.
It is easily
seen that
the outgoing
electron
packet
eventually
becomes
completely
separated
both
from
the initial
wave
field, 4,(x,

packet for the photoelectric
effect, 84', Ldefined
in Eq.

should
happen
to enter
this
packet, then the others can be ignored,
and the system
acts for all practical purposes
like an outgoing
electron,
plus
an
independent
outgoing
light
quantum.
The
reader
will readily
verify that the probability
that the
light
quantum
k', p,' appears
along
with
an electron
with
angles
0, p is precisely
the same as in the usual
interpretation.
APPENDIX B. A DISCUSSION OF INTERPRETATIONS
OF THE QUANTUM
THEORY PROPOSED
BY DE BROGLIE AND ROSEN
After
this article
had
been prepared,
the author' s
attention
was called to two papers
in which
an inter-
pretation
of the quantum
theory
similar
to that
sug-
gested here was proposed, erst by L. de Broglie, ' and
later by N. Rosen." In both of these papers, it was
suggested
that if one writes P=R exp(is/k),
then
one
can regard
R' as a probability
density
of particles
having
a velocity, v= Vs/m.
De Broglie regarded
the
P-field as an agent "guiding" the particle, and therefore
referred
to iP as a "pilot wave. " Both of these authors
came to the conclusion
that
this interpretation
could
not consistently
be carried
through
in those cases in
which
the field contained
a linear
combination
of sta-
tionary
state wave functions.
As we shall
see in this
appendix,
however,
the difhculties
encountered
by the
above authors
could have been overcome
by them,
if
only they had carried their ideas to a logical conclusion.
De Broglie's suggestions
met strong objections on the
part
of Pauli, " in
connection
with
the
problem
of
inelastic
scattering
of a particle
by a rigid
rotator.
Since this problem
is conceptually
equivalent
to that of
inelastic
scattering
of a particle
by a hydrogen
atom,
which
we have already
treated
in Paper I, Sec. 7, we
shall discuss the objections raised by Pauli in terms of
the latter example.
Now,
according
to
Pauli s argument,
the
initial
wave
function
in
the
scattering
problem
should
be
4'=exp(ipo
y/k)iPO(x). This corresponds
to a stationary
state for the combined
system,
in which
the particle
momentum
is
po, while
the hydrogen
atom
is in its
ground
state, with a wave function, fo(x). After inter-
action between
the incident particle and the hydrogen
atom, the combined wave function can be represented
as
(B&)
where f„(x) is the wave function
for the eth excited
state of the hydrogen
atom, and f„(y) is the associated
expansion
coefficient. It is easily
shown"
that
asym-
ptotically, f„(y) takes the form of an outgoing
wave,
f (y)
g (8 y)e'"""/r,
where
(kkm)'/2m=[(kko)'/2im5
+E„Eo.Now,
if we wr—ite iP=R exp(iS/k),
we find
that
the
particle
momenta,
p, = V,S(x, y)
and
p„
= V'„S(x, y), fluctuate
violently
in a way that depends
strongly
on the position
of each particle. Thus, neither
atom nor the outgoing
particle
ever seem to approach
a stationary
energy. On the other hand,
we know from
experiment
that both the atom and the outgoing particle
do eventually
obtain
definite
(but presumably
unpre-
dictable)
energy values. Pauli therefore
concluded
that
the
interpretation
proposed
by
de Broglie
was
un-
tenable.
De Broglie
seems
to have
agreed
with
the
conclusion,
since he subsequently
gave up his suggested
interpretation. '

Our answer to Pauli's objection is already
contained
in Paper I, Sec. 7, as well as in Sec. 2 of this paper.
For as is well
known,
the
Use of an incident
plane
wave of in6nite extent is an excessive abstraction,
not
realizable
in practice. Actually,
both -the incident
Rnd
outgoing
parts of the f-field will always take the form
of bounded
packets. Moreover,
as shown
in Paper I,
Sec. 7, all pa,ckets corresponding
to different
values of
e v;ill ultima, tely obtain
classically
describable
separa-
tions, The outgoing
particle
Qlust enter
one of these
packets, and it vriH remain
with that particular
packet
thereafter,
leaving the hydrogen
atom in a definite but
correlated
stationary
state. Thus, Pauli s objection
is
seen to be based on the use of the excessively abstract
model of an infinite plane wave.
Although
the above constitutes
a complete answer to
Pauli s specihc objections to our suggested
interpreta-
tion, we wish here to amplify
our discussion
sonnewhat,
in order
to anticipate
certain
additional
objections
that
might
be made
along
similar
lines, For at this
point,
one might
argue

though
the
wave
packet is bounded,
it can nevertheless

dis-
cussed

In his book, ' de Broglie raises objections to his own
suggested
interpretation
of the quantum
theory,
vrhich
are very similar to those raised by Pauli. It is therefore
not
necessary
to answer
de
Broglie'8
objections
in
detail here, since the answer is essentially
the same as
that which has been given to Pauli. We vrish, however,

NEUTRONS
FROM
0 I SI NTEGRATION
OF SI
to add one point. De Broglie assumes
that not only
electrons,
but also light
quanta,
are associated
with
particles. A consistent
application
of the interpretation
suggested
here requires,
however, as shown in Appendix
A, that light
quanta
be described
as electromagnetic
wave packets. The only precisely
definable
quantities
in such a packet are the I"ourier components,
ql, ,„,of the
vector
potential
and
the
corresponding
canonically
conjugate
rnomenta,
g1,,„. Such packets
have
many
particle-like
properties,
including
the ability to transfer
rapidly
a full
quantum
of energy at great distances.
Nevertheless,
it would not be consistent
to assume the
existence of a "photon" particle,
associated
with each
light quantum.
We shall now discuss Rosen's paper briefly."Rosen
gave up his suggested
interpretation
of the quantum
theory, because of difFiculties arising in connection
with
the interpretation
of standing
waves. In the case of the
stationary
states of a free particle
in a box, which
we
have
already
discussed
in Sec. 8, our interpretation
leads to the
conclusion
that
the particle
is standing
still.
Rosen
did not
wish
to accept
this
conclusion,
because it seemed to disagree with the statement
of the
usual interpretation
that in such a state the electron is
moving
with
equal
probability
that
the motion
is in
either direction. To answer Rosen s objections, we need
merely
point
out again
that
the usual
interpretation
can give no meaning
to the motion
of particles
in a
stationary
state; at best, it can only predict the prob-
ability
that
a given
result
will
be obtained,
if the
velocity is measured.
As we saw in Sec. 8, however,
our
interpretation
leads to precisely
the same predictions
as are obtained
from the usual interpretation,
for any
process which
could actually
provide
us with a meas-
urement
of the
velocity
of the
electron.
One
must
remember,
however,
that the value of the momentum
"observable" as it is now "measured"
is not necessarily
equal to the particle
momentum
existing
before inter-
action with the measuring
apparatus
took place.
We conclude
that
the objections
raised
by Pauli,
de Broglie, and Rosen, to interpretations
of the quan-
tum
theory
similar
to that suggested
here, can all be
answered
by carrying
every
aspect
of our
suggested
interpretation
to its logical conclusion.

The neutron
spectra from deuterons
on silicon have been studied
by the method
of recoil protons
and
photographic
plates. Thick isotopic targets
of the three separated
isotopes of silicon were irradiated
by
deuterons
of energy 1.4 Mev, supplied
by the Bartol Van de Graaff statitron,
observations
being carried
out at angles of zero and ninety
degrees with the incident
deuterons.
Q-values,
from which
energy
levels
in the residual
nuclei of phosphorous
may be calculated,
are as follows:

Si»(d,n)P"
4.92, 4.59, 3.73, 2.70, 1.51
The estimated
probable
error in the Q-values is 40 kev.
'HERE are three
stable
isotopes
of silicon, Si",
Si ', and Si", having
respectively
relative
abun-
dances of 92.28 percent, 4.67 percent, and 3.05 percent.
When
these
elements
are
irradiated
by
deuterons,
neutrons
are emitted
in the following
three reactions.
(1) Si"+d—+P"+n'+Q
(2) Si"+d—+P"+n'+Q3,
(3) Sj30+d~P31+nl+ Q

Naturally
occurring
silicon has been previously
bom-
barded
with deuterons
to observe the neutron
spectra. '
However,
because
of the element
of ambiguity
intro-
duced by the presence
of the mixture
of isotopes, the
data
are difficult
of interpretation.
To reinvestigate
the above three reactions,
quantities
of the separated
isotopes,
in the form of silicon dioxide,
were obtained
from the Y-12 plant,
Carbide
and Carbon
Chemicals
Division,
Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation,
Oak
Ridge,
Tennessee.
The mass
analyses
of the various
targets are shown in Table I.
