Digital Photo Projects For Dummies 

Introduction
I
f you browse the shelves of your local bookstore, you can find many books
about digital photography, including several by yours truly. As a smart
consumer, you’re probably wondering what makes this book different from
the rest and, more important, how those differences can benefit you.
Well, for one thing, most digital photography books go into more detail than
you may want (or need) to know right now. In-depth coverage is great for
photography enthusiasts, but if you’re just getting your digital legs, it also
can be overwhelming, not to mention time consuming. In addition, most digi-
tal photography books don’t say much about all the ways you can use photo
software to manipulate your pictures after you get them out of your camera
and onto the computer. For help with that aspect of digital imaging, you need
another book altogether — especially if you’re interested in working with
your old film photos as well as those from your digital camera.
Digital Photo Projects For Dummies, however, gives you the best of both worlds.
It gives you the basics you need to get good results from your digital camera,
without overloading you with lots of technical background. And when you’re
ready to fire up your photo software, you get step-by-step instructions that
show you exactly how to retouch and enhance all your pictures, whether
they started life in digital or film form.
Here’s just a sampling of what this book can help you do:
 Find the right camera, printer, scanner, computer, and software for all
your digital photo projects.
 Take better digital photos by gaining control over image quality, expo-
sure, color, and focus.
 Use simple photo-editing tools to correct just about any photo flaw.
 Retouch portraits by removing red-eye, covering blemishes, and whiten-
ing teeth.
 Scan and restore fading, discolored, or damaged prints and slides.
 Get creative with your pictures, turning them into digital collages, post-
cards, screen savers, and more.
 Add text, digital frames, special effects, and other enhancements.
 Produce great prints, share your photos online, and safeguard your digi-
tal files for the next generation.

Digital Photo Projects For Dummies 
At the risk of sounding like one of those late-night infomercials — but wait,
there’s more! — this book offers one other important feature that sets it apart
from its cousins on the store shelves. Glued into the back of the book is a
DVD that contains video tutorials in which I demonstrate how to accomplish
some of the projects in this book as well as a few additional ones. The DVD
also contains free trial versions of a variety of photo-editing software, includ-
ing the program featured in this book, Adobe Photoshop Elements.
To sum up, Digital Photo Projects For Dummies shows you how to get the shot,
edit the shot, and create something extra special with the shot. And here’s
the best part: Because it’s a For Dummies book, you don’t need any experi-
ence to join the fun.
About the Project Software
To provide you with step-by-step guidance for the photo-editing projects, I
had to choose a specific photo-editing program. I selected Adobe Photoshop
Elements, one of the few programs available for both Windows and Macintosh
computer systems. Elements also offers a great assortment of easy-to-use
tools at a reasonable price (under $100), which is one reason why it’s among
the most popular consumer photo-editing programs. (And no, I don’t get paid
by Adobe to sing its products’ praises.)
Specifically, the steps and figures feature Photoshop Elements 5.0 For
Windows. However, where version 5.0 differs significantly from version 4.0,
the latest version available for Macintosh users, I include alternative instruc-
tions in the steps.
For readers who don’t own Elements, the DVD included with this book con-
tains a tryout of version 5.0 for Windows. If you prefer some other software,
that’s fine, too. The basic concepts apply no matter what software you use,
and most programs offer similar retouching and editing tools, so you should
be able to translate the instructions to your program without much trouble.
How This Book Is Organized
The Table of Contents at the front of the book spells out exactly what topics
are covered in each chapter. But here’s a quick preview of what each part of
the book contains.

Part I: Digital Demystified
Few creative endeavors involve more confusing jargon and technical stuff
than digital photography. So you have good reason to feel a little lost at first.
But no worries: This part of the book helps you sort through all the mumbo
jumbo and gives you a firm footing in the digital landscape.
Chapter 1 guides you through the process of choosing the right camera,
photo software, and other imaging tools. Chapter 2 shows you how to get the
best results from your camera, discussing such baffling options as resolution,
file format, ISO, and white balance. And Chapter 3 explains how to transfer
your pictures to your computer, prepare them for print and online use, and
protect them from possible digital destruction. 
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs
The term digital darkroom refers collectively to computer software and hard-
ware that you can use to do the kinds of things that film photographers do in
a traditional darkroom — and then some. This part of the book shows you
how to use those tools to fix the most common picture problems.
Chapter 4 details how to correct exposure and focus, and Chapter 5 shows
you how to retouch portraits. Chapter 6 tells you what you need to know to
restore and repair old film photographs; correct colors; and cover up dust,
scratches, and other photo flaws.
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit
When you’re ready for some real creative fun, turn to this part of the book.
Chapter 7 introduces you to the art of photo compositing, which is the process
of combining photos to produce an entirely new image. You can use the tech-
niques found there to create a digital collage of your vacation pictures, for
example. Chapter 8 presents a variety of additional creative possibilities, from
surrounding a photo with a digital frame to turning a color photo into a black-
and-white or sepia-toned image.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Like all For Dummies books, this one concludes with chapters that each pro-
vide ten easy-to-digest tidbits of information. Chapter 9 offers up ten more
ways to use your digital photos, along with step-by-step instructions for tack-
ling those projects, and Chapter 10 offers my top ten tips for improving your
digital photos.

Digital Photo Projects For Dummies 
On the DVD: Bonus Content
In the introduction to this introduction, I mention that this book ships with a
DVD containing some extra goodies. To get a little more specific, here’s a par-
tial list of what the DVD holds:
 Video tutorials: In these digital movies, which you can play on any 
computer that has a DVD drive, you hear my voice as I show you how
to step through some of the book’s projects and also how to use some
Photoshop Elements tools not covered in the book. For your added
viewing pleasure, the DVD also contains a couple of additional tutorials
by my friend, the noted photographer Rick Sammon.
 Photo software: The DVD contains a free, 30-day trial version of
Photoshop Elements so that you have everything you need to complete
the book’s projects. But so that you can experiment with other options,
the DVD also offers trials of an assortment of other leading photo-editing
and photo-organizing programs. As with Elements, you can use most of
these trial versions free for 30 days — a great way to try before you buy.
 Demo images: I include copies of many of the images used in the book
so that you can use them as you follow along with the steps if you want.
For details on how to access all this stuff, see the DVD appendix at the back
of the book. 
Icons, Symbols, and Other Stuff to Know
One goal of For Dummies books is to make it as easy as possible for you to
find the information you need. To that end, the following icons call your
attention to certain types of information:
Tip icons highlight techniques that enable you to accomplish a task more
easily, in less time, or with better results.
If you see a Warning icon, the text points out a potential pitfall to avoid.
This icon labels information that provides you with background details that
can prove especially handy for one-upping the techie types in your life.

When I think it’s really, really important for you to retain some piece of infor-
mation, I mark it with this icon.
This final icon alerts you to related content that’s provided on the DVD.
You also need to know that in parts of the book that cover photo editing, the
little arrows in the text indicate that you need to choose commands from the-
program menus. For example, if you see the phrase “Choose Enhance➪Adjust
Colors➪Remove Color Cast,” you click the Enhance menu, click Adjust Colors
to open a submenu, and then click Remove Color Cast.
Finally, this book is designed, as much as possible, to enable you to dip in and
out of chapters as you please — you don’t need to read Chapter 4 to under-
stand Chapter 5, for example, or even read the first part of Chapter 4 to make
sense of the last part. If a project in a later chapter requires some knowledge
found elsewhere in the book, I point you to that information. Of course, the
index at the back of the book also helps you navigate to specific topics.
With those details out of the way, it’s time for me to stop introducing so you
can start reading. Flip through the book, find a project that interests you, and
enjoy!

Digital Photo Projects For Dummies 

Part I
Digital Demystiﬁed

D
on’t know a pixel from a poundcake? A ﬁle
format from a ﬁle drawer? Relax, you’re not
alone — everyone feels like a clueless outsider
when they’re getting started with digital photogra-
phy. But the chapters in this part help you get up
to speed in no time.
Chapter 1 provides the background you need to
set up a digital photography studio that matches
your creative interests, explaining how to deci-
pher the product ads and giving you the inside
scoop on what features are critical and which you
can do without. Chapter 2 helps you understand
and troubleshoot the most common digital pho-
tography problems, explaining which camera 
settings to change to produce the results you
want. And Chapter 3 guides you through the part
of the process that’s often the most confusing of all:
transferring your pictures to your computer and
then preparing them for print and online sharing.

Going Digital: Gearing Up 
for a Great Ride
In This Chapter
 Choosing the right digital camera
 Assessing your computer’s photo-readiness
 Looking at home printers and scanners
 Picking photo software
 Getting more help along the way
I
magine trying to dance the tango wearing oversized, steel-toed work
boots, playing a Beethoven sonata on a piano that has only 25 working
keys, or painting a portrait with a 12-inch-wide roller. You might be
able to get the job done — eventually — but working with the
wrong equipment would quickly turn what should be an
enjoyable pursuit into a frustrating chore.
To make sure that your experience with digital pho-
tography doesn’t become a similar headache, this
chapter helps you assemble the best equipment for
the kind of projects that you want to do. If you’re in
the process of shopping for a digital camera, you
can read my take on what features are “musts” and
which ones you can do without. I also spell out what
you need for a decent digital darkroom, discussing the
minimum computer specs and offering advice about
buying photo software, printers, and scanners. 
Finally, because even the best-equipped digital photography
studio can sometimes suffer minor breakdowns, this chapter con-
cludes with a list of online resources where you can get help with questions
that are beyond the scope of this book.

10
Part I: Digital Demystified 
Choosing the Right Digital Camera
When I wrote the first edition of Digital Photography For Dummies, way back in
1997, only a few digital cameras existed, and most offered the same set of fea-
tures, making shopping fairly easy. All you needed was cash — and lots of it.
The good news is that prices have come way, way down. The bad news is that
choosing the right camera has gotten pretty complicated, with every manu-
facturer offering a broad lineup of styles, models, and feature sets. And your
job is made all the more headache-inducing by the geekspeak used in camera
ads and brochures: “Captures 8-megapixel images in Raw or JPEG!” “Built-in
image stabilization!” “More than 20 scene modes!”
To help you narrow your choices, the following sections explain the most
important digital camera features and how they impact your picture-taking
possibilities. With this knowledge under your scalp, you can select a few top
candidates for your purchase and then seek out detailed reviews to help
finalize your decision. (See the list of online resources at the end of the chap-
ter to track down reviews.)
When you’re ready to buy, I suggest that you go to a camera store rather than
a big-box electronics store. Salespeople in camera stores tend to be photog-
raphy enthusiasts, which makes them better able to guide you to a camera
that will suit your needs. In addition, most big-box stores charge a “restock-
ing fee” — that is, you pay a percentage of the purchase price if you return
the camera. Traditional camera stores are usually more reasonable (although
you should ask to be sure). This return policy is especially important if
you’re buying the camera as a gift for someone else.
Megapixels: How many are enough?
In most camera ads, the feature that gets the most play is resolution, which is
measured in megapixels. Pixels are the tiny squares of color used to create a
digital image; Figure 1-1 gives you a close-up view. One million pixels add up
to 1 megapixel, often abbreviated as 1 mp. (Pixel is short for picture element,
if you care.)
Pixel count is directly related to picture quality. If you have too few pixels,
your picture is lousy, as shown in Figure 1-2. I shot this photo with a first-
generation digital camera, and the pixel population in those early models
simply wasn’t sufficient to produce good prints except at a thumbnail size.
Note especially the jagged appearance of curved and diagonal lines, such as
the edge of the girl’s face.
So how many megapixels do you need? Well, for a good-quality print, you need
at least 200 pixels per linear inch. For example, a 4 x 6-inch snapshot requires
800 x 1200 pixels, or a total of 960,000 pixels — just under 1 megapixel. Pictures
for e-mail and Web pages require significantly fewer pixels; a pixel count in the
450 × 400 pixel range is appropriate for e-mail photos, for example.

Figure 1-1: Digital images are created out of tiny blocks of color known as pixels.
Figure 1-2: An inadequate pixel count causes poor picture quality.

Chapter 1: Going Digital: Gearing Up for a Great Ride

12
Part I: Digital Demystified 
With the exception of cell phone cameras and toy cams for kids, all new digi-
tal cameras offer a minimum resolution of 3 megapixels, so, again, you’re set
for snapshot prints and even 5 x 7-inch prints. For reliable 8 x 10 and 11 x 14
prints, move up to the 4- to 6-megapixel range.
An even greater pixel count comes in handy when you want to crop your orig-
inal and then produce a large print of the remaining image area. For example,
the top image in Figure 1-3 contains 3008 x 2000 pixels, or 6 megapixels. That
high pixel count gave me the flexibility to crop away a huge portion of the
image and still have enough pixels to produce a quality print of the cropped
area, as you see in the lower image. 
Figure 1-3: Starting with a high-resolution original enables to you crop the image tightly
without sacrificing picture quality.

Unless you routinely crop photos or make large prints, though, don’t spend
extra for a super-megapixel camera. Put your savings into other camera 
features, such as a longer zoom lens, or invest in a high-capacity picture-
storage card.
A look at lenses
Too many people get so caught up in megapixels and other digital specs that
they don’t pay enough attention to the camera’s lens. But just as with a film
camera, a good lens is critical to the camera’s picture-taking capabilities, so
the next few sections offer some lens-shopping guidance.
Focal length: What does the camera “see”?
Focal length, measured in millimeters, determines how much of a scene a lens
can capture as well as how large and how far away the objects in the scene
appear. Here’s the scoop:
 Short versus long: With a short focal length, you get a wide angle of
view, and subjects appear smaller and farther away. As you increase
focal length, the angle of view narrows, and subjects appear closer and
larger. As an example, I stood at the same spot to shoot the images you
see in Figures 1-4 and 1-5 — bravely ignoring the impending thunder-
storm in the name of art, I might add. But I took the first image at a focal
length of 42mm; the second, 97mm. 
 Categories: Lenses are commonly grouped into three categories based
on focal length: 
• “Normal”: A focal length of 50mm is considered “normal” and is
standard on most point-and-shoot cameras. This focal length is
good for capturing the type of snapshots that most people enjoy
shooting.
• Wide-angle: A lens with a focal length under about 35mm is consid-
ered a wide-angle lens. A wide-angle lens is great for shooting land-
scapes and also comes in handy for photographing a group of
people from a short distance away. (The wide-angle perspective
enables you to fit more people in the shot.)
• Telephoto: A focal length of about 80mm or longer is referred to as
a telephoto lens. A telephoto lens enables you to get close-up pic-
tures of distant subjects, making it a favorite of travel, wildlife, and
sports photographers.
 Depth of field: Focal length also affects the apparent depth of field, or
the range of sharp focus. At a long focal length, objects near your sub-
ject appear sharp, but faraway objects appear blurry. At a short focal
length, distant objects are more sharply focused. You can explore this
issue more in Chapter 2.

appear smaller and farther away. 
Figure 1-5: Zooming to a longer focal length narrows the angle of view and 
makes objects appear larger and closer.
97mm
42mm

 Zoom: A zoom lens enables you to capture an image at a range of focal
lengths. For example, I own a zoom lens that offers a range of 28 to
200mm. In everyday lingo, we use the term zooming in when we shift to
a longer focal length and zooming out when moving to a wider-angle
view (shorter focal length). A few cameras instead offer a choice of two
or three specific focal lengths — say, 35mm and 80mm.
Speaking of a zoom lens, if that feature is important to you, be sure that
the camera offers a true optical zoom and not just a digital zoom. Digital
zoom is nothing more than some software manipulation that crops your
image and enlarges the remaining area. The result is always lowered
image quality.
A camera’s focal length is usually printed around the outer band of the lens
or, in some cases, elsewhere on the front of the camera body. Focal length is
also stated in the camera manual. Be sure to see the nearby sidebar, “Focal
lengths: Digital versus film,” for some important information about the num-
bers you see.
If you have trouble remembering all this focal-length stuff when you’re shop-
ping, most camera stores have charts that offer a visual representation of
what a lens sees at various focal lengths.
15
Chapter 1: Going Digital: Gearing Up for a Great Ride
Focal lengths: Digital versus film
Lens focal length is determined by measuring
the distance between the center of the lens and
the recording medium — the film negative in a
film camera or the image sensor in a digital
camera. But the results you get from a particu-
lar focal length depend not just on that distance
but also on the size of the recording medium.
With a camera that uses 35mm film — the kind
you’ve been putting in your film cameras for
years — the size of the recording medium is
consistent, as is the position of the film in the
camera body. So a lens with a particular focal
length provides the same view on one film
camera as it does on another. This standard
enables photographers to predict the capabili-
ties of a lens based on its focal length.
The digital world is different, however. Image
sensors vary widely in size, as does the location
of the sensor. And because of these variations,
a particular focal length on one camera may
produce completely different results on another
camera.
To address this issue, digital camera manufac-
turers describe lenses by using both the actual
(digital) focal length and the equivalent focal
length on a 35mm film camera. For example, a
camera manual might state the lens specifica-
tions as: “5.8–23.2mm; 35mm film equivalent:
35–140mm.” Don’t get confused by the “35mm
film” part; again, that number refers to the size
of the film negative, not the focal length. And
you thought computers were complex. . . .

16
Part I: Digital Demystified 
Lens quality: More important than megapixels?
In my opinion, yes, considering that all current digital camera models now
offer enough megapixels for the average user, but lens quality varies greatly.
A low-grade lens can cause all sorts of image defects, including:
 Vignetting: Often a problem with telephoto lenses, vignetting causes the
corners of a picture to appear darker, as in Figure 1-6.
 Barrel and pincushion distortion: The former gives your subject a
bloated look, as if it were wrapped around a barrel; the latter does the
opposite, pinching the subject inward.
 Color fringing: Also known as chromatic aberration, this defect creates
little halos of solid color around the edges of objects. Because the halos
are usually purple, this defect is sometimes referred to as purple fringing.
Figure 1-6: Vignetting causes light falloff at the corners of an image.
Unfortunately, the monitors on digital cameras aren’t large enough or clear
enough to give a good indication of lens quality, although you may be able to
spot serious distortion or vignetting. Theoretically, you could bring your own
camera memory card to the store, shoot some test pictures, and then review
the images on your computer — but that presumes that you already own the
right type of memory card and that you can find subjects suitable for evaluat-
ing lens quality.

For a simpler solution, trust this aspect of your purchase decision to the pros
who review cameras for a living. Read the latest issues of respected magazines
such as Shutterbug and Popular Photography and also check out the Web sites
listed at the end of the chapter. I probably shouldn’t admit it, but that’s
exactly what I do when I’m in the market for new equipment.
How much control do 
you want?
If you’re a casual photographer,
you’re probably used to working with
a fully automatic camera. You frame
the shot, press the shutter button,
and rely on the camera to set the
focus and exposure. And that’s a per-
fectly legitimate approach; the auto-
focus and autoexposure systems on
most cameras work amazingly well.
However, if you’d like to develop your
photography skills, consider a camera
that enables you to better manipulate
exposure and focus. By investing just
a little more in your camera, you can
enjoy the following features, which
fall in the “semi-manual” category (or
“semi-automatic,” depending on how
you look at it): 
 Aperture-priority autoexposure:
This feature enables you to
specify the aperture setting, or 
f-stop, an exposure control that
also affects depth of field, or the
range of sharp focus in a pic-
ture. After you set the aperture,
the camera selects the other key
exposure setting, shutter speed
(explained next).
 Shutter-priority autoexposure:
This feature enables you to speci-
fy shutter speed, an exposure
control that also affects whether
moving objects appear blurry or
sharply focused. For example, I
took the top picture in Figure 1-7
17
Chapter 1: Going Digital: Gearing Up for a Great Ride
1/120 second
1/500 second
Figure 1-7: By adjusting shutter speed, you
can control whether moving objects appear
blurry or frozen in time.

18
Part I: Digital Demystified 
at a shutter speed of 1/120 second, which wasn’t fast enough to freeze
my frolicking snow baby in mid romp. To capture the action without a
blur, I upped the shutter speed to 1/500 second. In shutter-priority AE,
the camera selects the appropriate aperture to properly expose the
image.
 Flexible (or variable) autofocus: This feature enables you to choose
from a variety of autofocusing schemes, with each option locking focus
at a different distance or on a different area of the frame.
For even more creative flexibility, you can move up to a model that offers
complete manual exposure and focus control. Of course, that level of control
adds to the camera price.
Before you pay more for
manual focusing, find out
how the feature is imple-
mented. With an SLR (single-
lens reflex) camera, you
adjust focus by twisting the
lens barrel, as you might
expect, and with some prac-
tice, you can focus in no
time. But with most point-
and-shoot models, you must
select a specific focusing dis-
tance from a camera menu,
as illustrated in Figure 1-8.
This system is a little cum-
bersome, to say the least.
Here’s one more bit of poten-
tial money-saving advice:
Most cameras now offer something called creative shooting modes or scene
modes. With this feature, you choose a type of picture — portrait, landscape,
action, and so on — and the camera then selects the aperture, shutter speed,
and, sometimes, focus mode that is considered appropriate for that type of
shot. For many people, scene modes provide the best of all worlds: a little
more creative control without the necessity of becoming a photography
expert or spending more for the camera.
Figure 1-8: On most point-and-shoot cameras, manual
focus mode requires you to select a focusing distance
from a scale displayed on the monitor.

Usually, scene modes are repre-
sented by little symbols like the
ones you see in Figure 1-9. Some
cameras offer more than a dozen of
these scene modes, giving you
everything from a fireworks mode
to a museum mode (which disables
flash and mutes all camera sounds).
Most cameras provide access to the
main modes via a camera dial or
button on the camera body; you
have to dig through menus to
choose the other modes. The more
modes you can get to without going
to menus, the better.
Chapter 2 provides more details
about manipulating focus and 
exposure.
Raw capture: Worth the hype?
Are you the type of photographer who would enjoy going into a darkroom
and developing your own film negatives? Do you demand the absolute top
image quality? If so, you may want a camera that offers Raw capture.
A little background: The data in a digital camera file, as in any computer file,
is nothing more than a series of numbers. In the case of a digital photo, those
numbers represent the pixel brightness values that the camera records when
you snap the picture.
At some point, those numbers have to be translated into an actual photo.
Traditionally, this work is done by software built into the camera. Think of
this system as the equivalent of in-camera developing of film negatives, if
such a thing were possible. After the camera processes the data, the final
image file is recorded to the camera memory card. In most cases, the data is
stored using a file format known as JPEG (say it jay-peg).
File format simply refers to a type of computer data file. Many formats have
been developed for storing digital art, but JPEG is the most prevalent for 
photographs.

task of shooting better portraits, landscapes, and
action shots.

Part I: Digital Demystified 
A few years ago, camera manufacturers introduced another alternative,
known generically as Raw capture, Camera Raw, or simply Raw. With this
system, the camera writes the original, unprocessed — uncooked — data
onto the memory card. Then the photographer opens the file on a computer,
using special software known as a Raw converter, and takes over the process
of translating the image data into a picture. Figure 1-10 offers a look at the
Photoshop Elements Camera Raw converter. This process takes some time
but gives the photographer the ultimate control over how the picture ingredi-
ents are baked into an image pie.
Figure 1-10: Photoshop Elements offers its own tool for processing Camera Raw files.
One other important distinction exists between Camera Raw and JPEG: JPEG
uses a process known as lossy compression, in which some image data is
dumped in the name of creating smaller files. Shrunken files are good because
they eat up less space on your camera memory card. But when too much com-
pression is applied, so much image data can be lost that you can wind up with
an ugly, blocky-looking image like the one you see in Figure 1-11.

Figure 1-11: Heavy JPEG compression results in a small image file, but horrible 
picture quality.
Don’t panic and assume that you must have Raw capture to get good digital
images, though. All cameras that record JPEG photos offer a high-quality
JPEG option. At this setting, the camera applies a minimum amount of com-
pression, providing a good trade-off between image quality and file size.
Whether your eyes can tell the difference between a lightly compressed JPEG
and a Raw image depends on the image, how much you enlarge the photo,
and of course, how well you see. For snapshots, you’re not likely to be able 
to tell the two apart. In fact, even when enlarged, you may not be able to spot
any quality loss in the JPEG version. As proof, Figure 1-12 shows a lightly
compressed JPEG image together with an uncompressed version created
from a Raw capture; Figure 1-13 offers a closer inspection of both images.

22
Part I: Digital Demystified 
Figure 1-12: Most people can’t see a quality difference between a lightly compressed JPEG image and an
uncompressed Raw image.
My take: If you answered “yes” to the two questions posed at the start of this
section, Raw capture is a worthwhile feature, assuming that you’re willing to
put in the extra time to process all your Raw files. Otherwise, you’ll be per-
fectly happy with JPEG. (And don’t listen to the photo snobs who insist that
Raw is the only way to go.)
A few other points on the issue:
 Each manufacturer has its own flavor of the Raw format, so the file for-
mats have different names. Nikon Raw files go by the moniker NEF;
Canon, CRW; and so forth.
 As an alternative to Raw capture, some cameras offer a third format
option, called TIFF (tiff, as in a little spat). In this format, the data goes
through the in-camera picture processing like a JPEG photo, but lossy
compression isn’t applied. So there’s no possibility of JPEG compression
defects, and you don’t have to run your files through a Raw converter
but your picture files are much larger.
Uncompressed
Light compression

 Before you can share a Raw or
TIFF file online, whether via
e-mail or on a Web site, you
must convert it to a JPEG file.
Chapter 3 shows you how.
 You can, however, immediately
use TIFF files in word-processing
programs, publishing programs,
and so on. (In fact, TIFF is the
preferred format for pictures
destined for publication.)
 Some high-end cameras offer a
handy option known as
JPEG+Raw. In this mode, the
camera creates both a JPEG file
and a Raw file every time you
press the shutter button. This
option is a nice convenience;
you can share your JPEG files
online immediately and then
process your Raw files when
you have time. Of course, saving
two copies of each image
requires more storage space on
your camera memory card, but
the JPEG files don’t create a
huge burden because of their
small size.
Viewfinder, monitor, 
or both?
Many digital cameras sold today
don’t have a viewfinder; instead, you
frame your picture by using the
camera’s monitor.
Using the monitor to compose your pictures can present two problems. First,
you have to hold the camera away from your body to take the picture, as
shown on the left side of Figure 1-14. This posture increases the odds that
your hands — and, by extension, the camera — may move slightly during the
exposure, which leads to blurry photos. With a viewfinder, you can brace the
camera against your face and tuck your elbows into your sides to steady the
camera, as shown in the right image in the figure.

Figure 1-13: Here you can see a close-up

24
Part I: Digital Demystified 
Figure 1-14: Framing shots via a monitor (left) can lead to camera shake; using a viewfinder enables you
to brace the camera against your face (right).
What’s more, some monitors wash out in bright light. So if you’re considering
a viewfinder-less camera, take the camera outside for a test run so that you
know that composing pictures in bright sunlight won’t be too much of a chal-
lenge. If you do decide you want a viewfinder — which is my recommenda-
tion, in case you couldn’t guess — be aware that viewfinders come in two
forms, optical and electronic. Here’s the scoop: 
 Optical viewfinder: An optical viewfinder is a standard viewfinder, the
kind you have on your old film camera. On most point-and-shoot cam-
eras, an optical viewfinder doesn’t show you exactly what the lens is
seeing. Instead, the viewfinder’s perspective is slightly above and to the
left of the lens. So the image that the camera records doesn’t exactly
match what you see through the viewfinder.
To deal with this issue — called parallax error — you can look for a
through-the-lens (TTL) viewfinder, which puts viewfinder and lens much
more in sync, although no optical viewfinder is 100 percent accurate.
Note that the camera monitor does provide an accurate preview, which
is the one upside of using it to frame your shots. Most digital SLRs, how-
ever, do not enable you to frame shots via the monitor; the monitor is
for reviewing pictures only.

 Electronic viewfinder: An electronic viewfinder is like a miniature moni-
tor; it displays the current camera settings along with the scene in front
of the lens. In other words, you see everything you would if you were
using the monitor to compose your shot. Unfortunately, the clarity of
the display on some electronic viewfinders isn’t so hot; all cameras are
not created equal in this regard. In addition, you can’t see anything
through an electronic viewfinder while the camera is powered off. For
this reason, I prefer optical viewfinders, but this is a personal choice.
One final note about viewfinders: Be sure that the viewfinder isn’t so tiny that
you have to work hard to even see through it. On cameras that have tiny
bodies, I find that the viewfinders are often way too small for easy viewing.
Still more features to consider
After sorting through the camera qualities covered so far, use the following
feature list to narrow down your camera choices even more. These features,
presented in no particular order, may seem insignificant now but can play a
big role in your long-term satisfaction:
 Physical fit: Hold the camera and take some test shots to try out the
position of the shutter button, viewfinder, and so on. Also be sure that
the camera is a comfortable size and weight. Those pocket-sized cam-
eras are great for portability, but if they’re too small, using them can be
difficult. The dials and buttons are by necessity also small, and it’s easy
to inadvertently cover a bit of the lens or flash with your finger. On the
other hand, some models are so bulky and heavy that you wouldn’t want
to carry them around on a long day of sightseeing.
 Ease of use: Are the controls that you’re likely to use most often easily
accessible? Having a bunch of buttons and dials on the outside of the
camera seems intimidating at first, but they actually make life simpler in
the long run. Features accessible only via menus take more time to
implement, which means that you’re less likely to use them.
 Image stabilization: This feature, which goes by different names
depending on the manufacturer, is designed to eliminate the blur that
can occur if you move the camera slightly during the image exposure.
If you choose a camera without a viewfinder, this feature is especially
helpful; see my earlier rant about this issue in the “Viewfinder, monitor,
or both?” section. But find out how the manufacturer implements the
feature. In some cases, turning on image stabilization simply shifts the
camera to a faster shutter speed, which shortens the time you need to
keep the camera still.
25
Chapter 1: Going Digital: Gearing Up for a Great Ride

26
Part I: Digital Demystified 
 Speed: Some cameras take several seconds to come to life after you
press the power button. Others are slow to record an image to the
memory card, requiring you to wait several seconds after you take one
shot before you can take another. And on some cameras, the autofocus
and autoexposure mechanisms are slow operators. Take some test shots
at various picture settings, with and without the flash, to be sure that
you won’t be frustrated with the camera’s speed, especially if you enjoy
sports or action photography.
 Battery type: Some cameras use proprietary batteries, whereas others
accept standard, rechargeable AA- or AAA-size batteries. Either is fine,
but with a proprietary battery, you can’t carry spare batteries with you
(unless, of course, you buy a second battery from the manufacturer,
which can be expensive).
Checking Your Computer Setup
You don’t need the latest greatest computer to do the kind of projects pre-
sented in this book. But you do need a relatively fast processor, a healthy
Memory cards: “Film” for the digital age
Instead of recording images on film, digital cam-
eras store your picture data on small cards
known generically as memory cards or picture
cards. Here are a few important factoids about
your so-called “digital film”:
 Type: Cards come in several flavors:
CompactFlash (CF), Secure Digital (SD),
Memory Stick, and xD are the most common.
No one type is better than the other —
they’re all based pretty much on the same
concept. But most cameras can accept only
one type of card, so check your camera
manual before buying more cards. Note, too,
that if you own a media player or other
device that uses the same type of card as
your camera, you can use your cards for
both purposes.
 Capacity: Cards also come in different
capacities, with the most common sizes
ranging from 512MB (megabytes) to 2GB
(gigabytes). How many pictures you can
store on a particular size of memory card
depends on the size of the picture file,
which in turn is dependent on the file format
(JPEG, TIFF, or Camera Raw) and image res-
olution (pixel count) that you use when you
take the picture. See Chapter 2 for more
details about these settings.
 Speed: Some cards are advertised as high-
speed cards, which means that they enable
your camera to record and access picture
data more quickly. However, before you pay
more for a high-speed card, be sure that
your camera can take advantage of this
feature; many can’t.

supply of system memory (RAM), and a hard drive that has plenty of free
storage space. Otherwise, your computer may run your photo software at a
pace that’s frustratingly slow or, if you’re working with very large digital files,
be unable to handle the load at all.
Here are my recommendations for the minimum computer requirements:
 Processor: The processor, or CPU (central processing unit), is the part
of your computer that does the, er, computing. The faster the processor,
the better. If you run Windows, I suggest a Pentium 4 or Celeron 1.3 Ghz
processor or better; on the Mac side, a PowerPC G3 or better.
 System operating software (OS): To work on a Windows-based machine,
most new photo programs require Windows XP (with Service Pack 2) or
later. On a Mac, most programs require OS 10.4 or later. Again, check the
system requirements for the software you want to use, especially if your
computer runs the very latest operating system; some software may not
yet be fully compatible with Windows Vista, for example. 
 System memory (RAM): At a bare minimum, you need 512MB of RAM.
The more, the merrier; adding RAM typically increases the speed of all
your programs.
 Hard drive: The hard drive is the internal storage device that holds
your programs and data files. The computer also needs some empty
hard drive space to use as a temporary data-storage tank when you
work on your pictures.
If you see an alert box saying that your scratch disk is full, as shown in
Figure 1-15, you don’t have enough free hard drive space. You’ll need to
delete some files or programs in order to go forward. (You may see the
term virtual memory instead of scratch disk depending on the program
you’re using.)
Figure 1-15: The scratch disk is empty space on your hard drive 
that your software needs to operate properly.
27
Chapter 1: Going Digital: Gearing Up for a Great Ride

28
Part I: Digital Demystified 
If needed, you can add a second hard drive to your system. Adding an
internal drive isn’t hard, but if you’re squeamish about opening up your
computer case, you can get an external drive that connects via a USB or
FireWire cable.
I do not recommend using a hard drive, either internal or external, for
long-term archiving of your important picture files. Hard drives do fail,
and when they do, your data is usually lost. Instead, look at your hard
drive as temporary storage for your working files; back up important
pictures to a CD or DVD (see next bullet).
 CD or DVD burner: At present, the best way to safeguard your image files
is to “burn them” — that is, record them — to a CD or DVD. My personal
preference is CD because the jury is still out on which DVD-recording
format will be around ten years from now. However, a CD-ROM holds
only 650MB of data, which isn’t very much in the modern era of high-
resolution digital photos, whereas a DVD holds about 4.7GB.
The good news is that most computers now ship with a DVD burner,
which can produce either DVDs or CDs, so you have choice. Personally, I
burn my most precious family pictures to a CD-ROM and copy my other
photos to a DVD.
Chapter 3 offers more tips on protecting your picture files.
Selecting a Photo Printer
In the market for a new printer? As with cameras, you have a wide range of
choices. Your first decision relates to the print technology. You have three
options: dye-sub, laser, and inkjet. Here’s my take on each: 
 Dye-sub: Most dye-sub (short for dye sublimation) printers can produce
only snapshot-size prints. More important, you must use special, dye-
sub compatible paper, usually sold together with the actual dye ribbons
or cartridges. You can’t print on plain paper, textured photo papers, and
other specialty papers, as you can with a laser or inkjet printer. So if you
want to print greeting cards, advertising flyers, and the like, a dye-sub
printer isn’t a good solution.
 Laser: If you need to print large volumes of regular documents as well
as photos, a laser printer is a good choice. For plain-paper printing,
laser printers usually are cheaper and faster than inkjets. On the down-
side, laser printers tend to be bulkier than inkjets, and you need to read
reviews carefully because not all lasers do a great job with photos.

 Inkjet: Inkjet printers are the best all-around choice for most digital 
photographers, offering excellent photo printing and the capability for
printing on a wide variety of paper stocks. The printers themselves are
usually inexpensive, but you need to factor the cost of ink into your 
purchase decision. You can save money by choosing a model that has
separate ink cartridges for each color. With models that use a single car-
tridge, you often wind up throwing away ink because not all colors are
depleted at the same rate.
Whichever print technology you choose, give extra points to models that
offer slots that can read your camera memory cards, as shown in Figure 1-16,
which features a model from HP. This feature gives you the option of printing
directly from the card; you don’t even have to fire up your computer. In addi-
tion, you can transfer image files to your computer via the card slot instead
of cabling the camera to the computer. See Chapter 3 for more on this topic.
If you need a scanner as well as a printer, look at an all-in-one inkjet or laser
machine. In the old days — a few years ago — all-in-ones didn’t do a great 
job on photos, but now many manufacturers use the same print heads in
their all-in-one machines as in their photo printers. (Again, it pays to read
reviews to ensure top quality.) Check out the next section, which offers 
scanner-buying tips, to make sure that both the printer and scanner part 
of the machine offer the specs you need.

No fuss, no muss: Retail photo printing
When you have more than a few images to print,
consider letting the local photo pros do the job.
You can drop off your camera memory card at
any retail photo lab and pick up your prints as
soon as an hour later, just as you used to do with
your film pictures. In most cases, you’ll get
better prints than you can make at home, with
less hassle, less time, and for less money. 
If you have a high-speed Internet connection
and are computer-comfortable, you can even
send your image files directly to the lab via the
Web, and then pick up your prints when you’re
ready. To find a lab in your area, check out the

Considering Your Scanning Options
Before you can work with your existing film prints or slides, you need to have
them digitized, or, in layman’s terms, scanned. You can go about this in two
ways: You can take your prints, slides, or negatives to a local lab for scan-
ning, or you can buy a scanner and do the job yourself.
If you’re new to the whole imaging game, to computers, or both, I highly
recommend letting a professional handle the job. Yes, you’ll pay for the 
service, but the results are likely to be much better than you can produce
yourself because the equipment is better than what’s found in home scanners.
Most labs also do the job of cleaning your originals before scanning, which is
essential to a good result. In most cases, your scanned images are put on an
archival CD or DVD.
If you want to tackle the job yourself, Chapter 6 has scanning guidelines, and
the following tips will help you buy a good scanner:
 Flatbed versus sheetfed scanners: For scanning prints, get a flatbed
scanner rather than a sheetfed scanner. The latter takes your original on
a curved path past the scanner head, which can damage photographic
prints. With a flatbed, you lay the original on a flat sheet of glass, and
the scanner head moves underneath the print.
Memory Card
slots

 Film scanners: To scan film negatives, slides, or transparencies, you have
two choices. You can get a flatbed scanner that offers an adapter for those
originals, or you can get a dedicated film scanner. Film scanners typically
produce better results than the flatbed-with-adapter setup, but they’re
pricey and can’t scan prints.
 Optical resolution: Like a digital camera, a scanner creates pixel-based
images. And just as with a digital camera, pixel count determines how
large you’ll be able to print your scanned image and still enjoy good
image quality. To determine the pixel capabilities of a scanner, look for a
specification called optical resolution. 
Most scanners state resolution using two numbers, such as 2400 x 1200.
Without going into detail, the “real” resolution number is the lower of
the two. All other things being equal, higher is better. But again, be sure
that you pay attention only to the optical resolution; claims such as
“maximum resolution up to 9600” usually indicate a resolution that’s
achievable only through a software process called interpolation, which
doesn’t add to image quality.
 Bit depth: One other scanner spec to consider is bit depth, which deter-
mines how many possible colors the scanner can reproduce. Look for a
model that delivers between 36 and 48 bits. Technically, 48 is better, but
you’re not likely to see a difference with most pictures, and your photo
software may not be able to open 48-bit files. See Chapter 6 for more
details on bit depth.
As with buying a printer or digital camera, you should check out print and
online reviews of the scanner models you’re considering. Image quality varies
greatly, and just knowing the resolution and bit depth isn’t enough to ensure
that you’re buying a good machine.
Choosing Photo Software
To complete your digital darkroom, you need some capable photo software.
This book features the leading consumer photo software, Adobe Photoshop
Elements. I chose this program because it’s reasonably priced, it’s one of the
few options available for both Windows and Mac computers, and it offers all
the tools that most digital photographers need. Elements also has a user-
friendly interface, offering you on-screen guidance, as shown in Figure 1-17.
The figure shows you Elements 5.0 for Windows; if you use another version of
the program, it appears much the same. (As I write this, the most current ver-
sion available for Mac users is 4.0.)

Figure 1-17: Photoshop Elements offers on-screen help for the novice.
Elements isn’t the only good product on the market, however. If you haven’t
yet invested in photo software, you may also want to consider programs such
as Corel Snapfire Plus and ArcSoft PhotoImpression. Like Elements, these pro-
grams are aimed at the novice user and offer lots of on-screen help. If you
watch the sale ads, you can get any of them for under $100.
What about that granddaddy of all photo programs, Adobe Photoshop? It’s the
program the pros use, so shouldn’t you? Well, assume for a moment that price
is no object: Your budget can easily handle the $650 price tag. (Will you adopt
me?) I still encourage you to start your photoediting career with something a
little less intense. As you can see from Figure 1-18, Photoshop isn’t designed for
beginners — you won’t find the friendly, helpful interface you get in Elements
and other entry-level programs. In addition, you’ll likely be paying for a lot of
high-end features that you’ll never use: tools for creating CMYK separations,
manipulating image channels, drawing clipping paths, and so on. Wait, you say
that you don’t know what any of that means? Now you get my point.

Figure 1-18: Photoshop is a great program, but it’s not designed for beginners.
So that you can do your own software evaluations, the DVD that comes with
this book offers tryout versions of a variety of photo-editing programs.

hen you first unpacked your new digital camera,
you no doubt sat right down and read the
manual. So you know, for example, that you’re using
the correct batteries, that you have the memory card
inserted properly, and that you understand the
basics of how to snap and review your pictures.
But even after your best efforts, many of your pic-
tures aren’t so great. Maybe they’re a little blurry.
Maybe they’re underexposed or overexposed or
slightly off in the color department. Or maybe the
sharpness and clarity of your images is disappointing.
Projects in later chapters show you how to correct these
and other issues in your photo editor. But I’m guessing that
you’d just as soon avoid problems in the first place and spend less
time cleaning up your pictures after the fact. To that end, this chapter helps
you troubleshoot the most common photographic problems encountered by
digital photographers.

Part I: Digital Demystified 
What’s that? You say you haven’t read your camera manual? Well, I can’t
encourage such behavior, but given the miniscule type and dry prose found
in most manuals, I can’t blame you, either. So I’ll make you a deal: Just get the
manual now, and as you read this chapter, tab the pages that tell you how to
access the features I mention. Unfortunately, all cameras are different in this
regard, so I can’t give you the specifics. (If you lost the manual, most manu-
facturers offer downloadable versions on their Web sites.)
Also check out Chapter 10, which offers some additional tips for improving
your digital photos.
Improving Picture Quality
First, a definition: by picture quality, I don’t mean the artistic composition,
color, exposure, or focus, but rather how finely the camera renders the image. 
The quality of the camera lens plays a large role in determining the clarity
and sharpness of the photo, of course. But three digital camera settings —
resolution (pixel count), file format, and ISO — also impact picture quality. 
If you choose the wrong settings, your pictures may be grainy, exhibit odd
color defects, or appear jagged or blocky. The following sections tell you
what camera settings to use to avoid these problems.
Preventing pixel pitfalls
Most cameras enable you to choose from several resolution settings. As I
describe in Chapter 1, this setting determines how many pixels the camera
uses to record the image. Pixels are the tiny squares of color from which digi-
tal images are built.
Depending on the camera, you may specify resolution through a single con-
trol, or you may select a resolution and file format in combination. Cameras
that offer a single setting may name the control picture size or something sim-
ilar; models that lump resolution and format together often name the setting
picture quality. Check your manual for specifics.
Regardless of how your camera handles the matter, pixel count is critical to
the quality of printed digital photos. In short, the number of pixels deter-
mines how large you can print your photo without your image becoming 
a mess.

Figures 2-1 and 2-2 offer an illustration of the impact resolution makes. In the
first image, a healthy pixel population results in a great-looking picture. But in
the pixel-poor second photo, details aren’t clear, color transitions are choppy,
and diagonal and curved lines have a stair-stepped appearance — a problem
that imaging pros refer to as the jaggies.
Figure 2-1: An adequate pixel supply ensures that details are finely rendered.
The number of pixels required to produce an optimal print varies depending
on the printer. Figure 2-1 has a resolution of 300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi,
which is the norm for commercial printers like those used to produce this
book. Figure 2-2 has a resolution of just 50 ppi, which might be appropriate
for printing bird-cage liners, but only for undiscriminating birds.
I suggest that you aim for at least 200 ppi. Remember, that’s pixels per linear
inch, not square inch. Table 2-1 lists the approximate pixel count needed to
meet the 200 ppi threshold for standard print sizes. Some printers may need
more pixels — even as many as 360 ppi — so check the manual for the manu-
facturer’s recommendation or make some test prints to experiment. Most
retail and online photo labs offer guidance as to the recommended print size
indicated by the pixel count of your image file, too.

Of course, most people don’t know at the time they take a picture how large
they’ll wind up printing it. So should you just max out your camera’s resolu-
tion setting and leave it there? Well, that depends. First, understand that a
very high-resolution setting does have some disadvantages:
50 ppi

 The higher the resolution, the fewer pictures you can store on a
camera memory card. File size increases as the pixel count grows, so
each picture takes up more storage space. Your manual should offer a
chart that shows you how many pictures you can fit on a given capacity
memory card at each resolution setting.
 High-resolution pictures take longer to record to memory. Your camera
needs more time to process a larger image file than a smaller one. 
 High-resolution pictures are too large for on-screen use. Chapter 3
explains the details, but for now, just understand that for on-screen pic-
tures, pixel count doesn’t affect image quality, only the size at which the
picture appears. For e-mail picture sharing, anything larger than about
450 pixels wide or 400 pixels tall is too large to allow the entire picture
to be viewed without scrolling the display on most monitors. (Keep in
mind that the e-mail browser eats up a good portion of the monitor
space.)
So here’s my best advice: A maximum resolution setting is appropriate if your
main concern is being able to make large prints or substantially crop your
images.
On the other hand, dial down resolution if 
 You’re running out of memory card space.
 You’re trying to shoot action pictures and the speed at which the
camera is recording images is hampering your efforts.
 You know without a doubt that the picture is solely for on-screen use
and you’ll never print it.
Note, however, that even if you capture an image at the camera’s lowest reso-
lution, you still may need to dump some pixels to size the picture appropri-
ately for on-screen use. Chapter 3 shows you how.
One last critical note: Although you can easily dump excess pixels in your
photo program, don’t expect to be able to add pixels after the fact. Doing so
doesn’t improve the photo quality and in fact can degrade it, as illustrated by
Figure 2-3. I added enough pixels in my photo editor to bring the picture reso-
lution up to 300 ppi, and as you can see, the quality is nowhere near that of
the 300 ppi original shown in Figure 2-1.
Digital gurus refer to the process of adding or deleting pixels as resampling,
by the way. Adding pixels is also sometimes called upsampling, and deleting
pixels is called downsampling.

The evil truth about digital zoom
Most digital cameras offer a feature known as
digital zoom, and many manufacturers make a
big deal about it, highlighting the digital zoom
power in camera advertisements. But In fact,
digital zoom does nothing but crop away the
perimeter of your picture and enlarge the
remaining area. Usually, pixels are then added
to the image to make it appear as though the
scene was recorded at the original pixel count.
The end result is the same as enlarging and
resampling a low-resolution picture: reduced
image quality. Also, digital zoom doesn’t offer
the same shift in perspective and depth of field
as a real, or optical zoom lens. For more on that
subject, see the Chapter 1 section related to
focal length. In the meantime, disable digital
zoom on your camera if possible. Otherwise,
check the manual to find out whether the
camera alerts you when digital zoom kicks in so
that you can avoid shifting into that mode. And
if you’re shopping for a new camera, pay atten-
tion only to the specifications related to optical
zoom — that’s the feature that matters.

Avoiding JPEG artifacts
By default, most digital cameras record picture files using the JPEG (jay-peg)
file format. You typically can choose from two or more JPEG capture settings,
each of which results in a different image quality. Often, the setting names are
vague, such as Basic, Fine, and Superfine or Low, Normal, and High.
As Chapter 1 explains, the JPEG format creates smaller files by applying lossy
compression, a process that eliminates some picture data. At the lower-
quality JPEG settings, file sizes are very small, so you can fit more pictures
on your camera memory card but so much data gets dumped that those 
pictures look awful.
Symptoms of a highly compressed JPEG include random color defects and an
overall blocky or tiled appearance – problems that imaging pros refer to col-
lectively as JPEG artifacts. Figure 2-4, which shows a portion of architectural
photo featured in the resolution discussion, offers an example. The left image
was produced using minimal JPEG compression; the right example, extreme
compression.
Figure 2-4: For best results, stick with the highest-quality JPEG setting.

Heavy JPEG compression

Chapter 2: The Digital Photographer’s Troubleshooting Guide

42
Part I: Digital Demystified 
At the size shown in Figure 2-4, the
difference between the two images
appears minimal, although you can
see some odd color artifacting in the
heavily compressed version, and
details aren’t as sharp. But as the
print size increases, compression
artifacts become more apparent, as
illustrated by the enlarged examples
shown in Figure 2-5.
Notice that the tiled look that you get
from heavy JPEG compression
appears slightly different from the
blocky appearance that’s caused by
too few pixels. Because of the way
that JPEG processes images, your
entire photo appears to have been
divided into equal blocks. With low
resolution, the blockiness typically
occurs along diagonal and curved
lines. Keep that difference in mind if
you have trouble deciding whether
your quality problems stem from too
few pixels or too much compression.
JPEG artifacts are extremely difficult to
remove or even diminish in a photo
editor, so always stick with your
camera’s highest-quality JPEG setting
for important pictures. Stock up on
additional memory cards if needed to
accommodate the larger file sizes. And
of course, remember that if you com-
bine heavy compression — 
your camera’s lowest-quality JPEG 
setting — with low resolution, your
quality problems are multiplied.
To avoid any possibility of artifacting, you also can consider shooting in the
TIFF or Camera Raw format, if your camera offers those options. See Chap-
ter 1 for more information on the pros and cons of those formats as com-
pared to JPEG.

Figure 2-5: JPEG defects become more
apparent when you enlarge your image.

Deadening noise
Your digital camera likely offers an ISO control, which adjusts the camera’s
sensitivity to light — and, in turn, determines how much light is needed to
expose a picture. At a high ISO setting, the camera is more sensitive, so you
can capture an image with less light.
Film is also assigned an ISO rating based on its light sensitivity. The ISO
rating, sometimes referred to as the film speed, is marked on the film box.
Consumer film usually comes in ISO 200, 400, 800, and 1600; the range of ISO
settings on digital cameras varies.
Although raising the ISO enables you to capture a brighter image, it has a
pretty serious downside. At higher ISO settings, digital pictures often exhibit
a defect known as noise, which makes your photo look as though it was sprin-
kled with sand. You usually get a similar defect, called grain, when you shoot
with high-speed film.
Figure 2-6 illustrates the pros and cons of raising the ISO on a digital camera. 
I shot this little guy inside a dimly lit nature museum. I used the same aper-
ture and shutter speed — which control how much light can strike the
camera’s image sensor — for each exposure. (See the upcoming section,
“Understanding exposure,” for more about aperture and shutter speed.) At 
a low ISO, the image quality is superb, but the exposure is too dark. Raising
the ISO produced a brighter exposure but at the cost of increased noise,
which is especially visible in areas that contain little detail, such as the back-
ground in this photo. Figure 2-7 offers a close-up comparison of all three
images.
The amount of noise produced at a given ISO setting depends on the camera,
so experiment to find the acceptable noise threshold on your model. And
whenever possible, keep the ISO at its lowest setting for pictures where
image quality is critical.
In very dark lighting, you may not be able to capture the image without rais-
ing the ISO, but know that you do so at a price. Usually, in fact, you’re better
off keeping the ISO down and then brightening the image in your photo editor
if needed. See Chapter 4 for a look at this process. 
If your camera offers an Auto ISO setting, which allows the camera to adjust
the ISO as needed based on the light conditions, I suggest that you disable
the feature. Because of the impact of ISO on image quality, you should be the
one to control it.

Part I: Digital Demystified 
Figure 2-6: Raising the ISO makes the camera more light sensitive but also increases noise.
Note, too, that noise also tends to increase as you reduce the shutter speed,
which results in a longer exposure time. Balancing ISO and shutter speed can
be tricky because a low ISO often means that you need a longer exposure —
so the noise reduction you get from a lower ISO can be offset by that longer
exposure. When all is said and done, simply adding more light to the scene is
the best solution. With more light, you can use a lower ISO, a faster shutter,
or both. Again, see the upcoming discussion about exposure if you’re new to
the concept of shutter speed.

Getting Good Results in Automatic Mode
Your camera probably arrived from the factory set to fully automatic mode.
All you have to do is frame the shot and press the shutter button, and the
camera automatically sets the focus and selects the right exposure settings.
Because today’s autoexposure and autofocus systems are so refined, they
produce good results in most photographic situations. However, the auto-
everything systems can’t do their jobs unless you use the proper shutter-
button technique.
Yes, you read that correctly. How you press the shutter button determines
whether the camera can accurately set both focus and exposure. You need to
take the following approach, illustrated in Figure 2-8:
1. Frame the picture and then press and hold the shutter button
halfway down.
You may hear the camera innards whirring or buzzing as the autofocus
and exposure mechanisms do their thing.
2. Wait for the signal that the focus and exposure are set.
On some cameras, a small light appears near the viewfinder. On others,
the camera emits a beep. And some models give you both a light and 
a beep.
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down.

Figure 2-8: Depress the shutter button halfway, wait for the 
“okay” signal, and then press the button the rest of the way 
to capture the image.
One note on this process: It’s critical that you frame your shot so that your
main subject is within the frame area that your camera considers when set-
ting exposure and focus. Most cameras base their calculations either on the
center of the frame or on the entire frame, for example. And many cameras
use one frame zone for setting focus and another for setting exposure. Your
manual should offer a diagram indicating the available focus and exposure
zones, as well as information about whether you can select a different zone
from the camera’s default.
If your camera bases focus or exposure on the center of the frame and you
want to compose the picture so that your subject is off-center, use this tech-
nique, illustrated in Figure 2-9: Frame the picture so that your subject is
within the center of the frame. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to
lock the focus and exposure on your subject. After you get the “go ahead”
signal from the camera, reframe the picture to the composition you want —
don’t let up on the shutter button — and then press the shutter button the
rest of the way down.

on your main subject, you can reframe the picture

Solving Exposure Problems
Even if you use the picture-taking technique outlined in the preceding section,
some subjects and lighting situations can give your camera’s autoexposure
system fits. In fact, even in manual mode, which gives you complete control
over the exposure settings, getting a proper exposure isn’t always easy.
When your camera monitor indicates that your picture is overexposed
(too bright) or underexposed (too dark), the next sections offer ways to 
correct the problem.

Chapter 2: The Digital Photographer’s Troubleshooting Guide

Part I: Digital Demystified 
Understanding exposure
To better grasp the troubleshooting techniques offered in the following sec-
tion and elsewhere in the book, you need a brief primer on exposure.
A photograph is created when light is gathered by a lens and then is allowed
to strike a light-sensitive recording medium. Whether that medium is a film
negative or a digital camera’s image sensor, the brightness, or exposure, of
the picture depends on three factors:
 The light sensitivity of the film or image sensor
 The size of the beam of light that strikes the negative or image sensor
 The duration of the light
On your digital camera, these factors are determined by the following controls:
 ISO (light sensitivity): The section “Deadening noise,” earlier in this
chapter, introduces ISO ratings, which indicate the light sensitivity of
film and digital image sensors. As ISO goes up, so does light sensitivity.
 Aperture (size of light beam):
The aperture is a hole in an
adjustable diaphragm that lies
between the lens and the shut-
ter, as illustrated in Figure 2-10.
Adjusting the aperture size con-
trols the size of the light beam
that can strike the recording
medium.
Aperture size is measured in 
f-numbers, more commonly
referred to as f-stops, and stated
as f/2, f/5.4, and so on. The
higher the f-stop number, the
smaller the aperture. For exam-
ple, an aperture setting of f/2
allows more light to enter the
camera than an aperture of f/8.
 Shutter speed (duration of
light): The shutter is positioned
between the aperture and the
recording medium, as indicated by Figure 2-10. When you press the shut-
ter button on your camera, the shutter opens so that the light that funnels
through the aperture can strike the film or image sensor.
The shutter speed control determines how long the shutter remains
open, typically for a fraction of a second. Shutter speeds are expressed
in seconds, as in 1 second, 1/400 second, and so on.
Lens

Image sensor
Shutter
Figure 2-10: Aperture and shutter speed
together control the amount of light that strikes
the image sensor (or film).

So, in theory, you can tackle an exposure problem by adjusting the three set-
tings either alone or in combination, as follows:
 For a brighter exposure: Select a lower f-stop number (open the 
aperture), choose a slower shutter speed, or raise the ISO. 
 For a darker exposure: Select a higher f-stop number (stop down the
aperture), choose a faster shutter speed, or lower the ISO.
I say “in theory” for a few reasons:
 Because raising the ISO often has the side effect of creating noise, a
defect introduced earlier in this chapter, I suggest that you avoid that
option and rely on aperture and shutter speed to adjust exposure.
 If your model offers only autoexposure, you can’t specify an aperture or
shutter speed. You can, however, tweak exposure by using the alterna-
tive techniques outlined in the upcoming section, “Tweaking exposure in
automatic mode.”
 Some cameras offer one or both of two semi-automatic autoexposure
(AE) modes, aperture-priority AE and shutter-priority AE. In aperture-
priority mode, you select the f-stop, and the camera sets the appropriate
shutter speed to produce a good exposure. In shutter-priority mode, you
set the shutter speed, and the camera selects the f-stop.
Although these modes enable you to select a specific aperture or shut-
ter speed, changing either control doesn’t result in a different exposure.
Instead, the camera simply adjusts the other setting to produce what-
ever exposure it thought was correct in the first place. For example, if
you open the aperture, the camera increases the shutter speed to com-
pensate. Again, use the workarounds presented in “Tweaking exposure
in automatic mode” to solve your exposure problems.
 Changing the aperture also affects depth of field, or the range of sharp
focus in the image. And the shutter speed determines whether moving
objects appear blurry or sharply focused (and whether any small
camera movements result in a blurry image). For these reasons, chang-
ing the aperture may not be as appropriate in some situations as adjust-
ing shutter speed, and vice versa. Read the next section for a more
thorough explanation.
Affecting focus with aperture and shutter speed
Technically, I probably shouldn’t say that you can affect focus by adjusting
aperture or shutter speed. Without going into the science, changing either
setting doesn’t actually shift focus in the purest sense of the word. But you
can manipulate the apparent focus of the image — in other words, what most
ordinary folks would describe as focus.

Chapter 2: The Digital Photographer’s Troubleshooting Guide

Part I: Digital Demystified 
Here’s the scoop:
 Aperture (f-stop) also affects depth of field. Depth of field refers to the
distance range within which objects are sharply focused. A photo in
which the main subject is sharply focused, but distant objects are not,
has a shallow depth of field. Pictures in which both near and distant
objects are sharply focused have a large depth of field.
Opening the aperture — that is, choosing a lower f-stop number —
decreases depth of field. Stopping down the aperture — selecting a
higher f-stop number — increases depth of field. Experienced photog-
raphers typically open the aperture when shooting portraits so that 
the background is diminished, as illustrated in Figure 2-11. But for land-
scapes or other shots in which you want to keep a greater area in sharp
focus, a higher f-stop usually works better.
Figure 2-11: Opening the aperture from f/22 to f/4 softened the focus of the background, making it less
distracting.
f/22
f/4

 Shutter speed also affects the appearance of moving objects. At slow
shutter speeds, moving objects appear blurry; fast shutter speeds can
“freeze” motion. How high a shutter speed you need depends on how
fast the object is moving. In Figure 1-7 in Chapter 1, for example, I needed
a shutter speed of 1/500 second to catch my flying furball in midstride.
A slower shutter speed left him blurry.
That’s not to imply, however, that a faster shutter speed is always desir-
able. Sometimes, blurring a moving object can create a heightened sense
of motion or other special effect. For example, many photographers
shoot waterfalls using a slower shutter speed to blur the water, which
gives it that soft, misty look. I took that approach to capture the right
image in Figure 2-12, slowing the shutter speed to 1/15 second. Using a
tripod is critical for slow-shutter shooting, however; otherwise, camera
shake is likely, making the entire scene blurry.
Whatever your creative goals, keep these side effects in mind when you
decide whether to tackle an exposure problem by adjusting aperture, shutter
speed, or both. Then pick the path that delivers both the exposure you want
and the focusing effects that best suit your subject.

Also note that aperture and shutter speed aren’t the only ways to manipulate
focus; for other possibilities, see the upcoming section, “Fixing Focus Flubs.”
Tweaking exposure in automatic mode
Even if you’re shooting in autoexposure mode or the two semi-automatic
modes (aperture-priority and shutter-priority AE), you have some control
over image brightness. You can tweak exposure using a feature called EV
compensation and, on some cameras, by changing the camera’s autoexpo-
sure metering mode. The next two sections discuss these controls.
Adjusting exposure with EV compensation
Almost all digital cameras offer an EV compensation setting, which enables you
to tell your camera that the exposure it produced is out of line. (EV stands for
exposure value.) Usually, you can increase or decrease the EV setting in incre-
ments of one-half or one-third step: EV +0.3, +0.7, +0.1, and so on. 
A setting of EV 0.0 is the default and results in no exposure adjustment. Raise
the value for a brighter exposure; lower it for a darker exposure. In Figure 2-13,
the original exposure produced in autoexposure mode left the statue too dark,
so I raised the EV setting to +0.7.
Figure 2-13: Use EV compensation to adjust exposure when you shoot in autoexposure mode.
EV 0.0
EV +0.7

Changing the autoexposure metering mode
The autoexposure metering mode refers to the method that the camera uses
to calculate the proper exposure. Some cameras offer a choice of modes; the
three most common work as follows:
 Full-frame metering: Referred to by many names, including matrix, 
average, multispot, and pattern, this mode sets exposure based on the
average brightness of the entire frame. This mode typically is used by
cameras that don’t offer adjustable metering modes.
 Center-spot metering: In this mode, exposure is based on the center of
the frame.
 Center-weighted metering: This mode calculates exposure based on the
entire frame but gives added emphasis to the center.
Full-frame metering is typically the default setting and works well for most
pictures. But if your subject is significantly darker or lighter than the back-
ground, switching to center-spot or center-weighted metering may produce
better results because the camera then assigns less importance to the back-
ground when calculating exposure.
In Figure 2-14, I switched to center-weighted metering because I wanted the
camera to pay more attention to the fountain than to the sky. Because the foun-
tain was darker, the camera increased the exposure accordingly. The result is a
brighter image that makes the figures at the bottom of the fountain more visible. 
Figure 2-14: Switching from full-frame metering (left) to center-spot metering 
(right) brightened the exposure.

If you want to use center-spot or center-weighted metering but you don’t
want your subject to be in the middle of the frame, use the workaround sug-
gested earlier: Frame the shot so that the subject is in the center of the
frame, lock in exposure by depressing the shutter button halfway, reframe
the picture, and then press the button the rest of the way. However, you also
may find it just as easy and efficient to instead use EV compensation to alter
the exposure.
Adding flash: Use it outdoors, too!
Sometimes, you can’t get a bright enough exposure no matter how much you
fiddle with your camera’s exposure controls. In dim lighting, you simply may
need to add artificial light, which makes the built-in flash found on most cam-
eras such a helpful feature.
Most cameras offer at least three flash settings: automatic mode, which fires
the flash when the camera thinks the light is inadequate; fill flash, also known
as force flash, which fires the flash no matter what; and no flash, which dis-
ables the flash. Some cameras also offer a red-eye reduction mode, which is
designed to reduce the chances of that all-too-familiar problem in portraits
taken with a flash. Table 2-2 offers a look at the symbols that typically indi-
cate these flash modes.
Table 2-2
Standard Flash Modes
Symbol
Mode
What It Does
Auto
Fires flash when camera thinks more light is 
needed.
Fill or Force
Fires flash regardless of available light.
No flash
Disables flash regardless of available light.
Red-eye reduction
Emits preflash before primary flash to
reduce red-eye.

Automatic flash mode works fine in many situations, but in some scenarios
you can get better results by taking the flash reins yourself. Here are my tips
for when to shift to manual:
 Use fill flash for better outdoor portraits and close-ups. Even when
skies are very bright, a flash makes a dramatic difference, as illustrated
by Figures 2-15 and 2-16. I took the first picture using autoflash mode,
and the camera didn’t fire the flash because it sensed enough ambient
light to expose the image. The background is fine, but the subject is 
too dark because the strong overhead light cast shadows on the face.
Adding the small pop of light from the flash solved the problem while
keeping the background properly exposed. Adding flash can also
improve close-ups of flowers and other small subjects.
 Disable the flash for indoor portraits whenever possible. I know, this
advice seems backwards: Use flash in bright sunlight, but turn it off
inside? But you probably already know the usual result when you take
indoor portraits with a flash: red-eye. So if possible, position your sub-
ject near a sunny window, turn on as many room lights as you can find,
and try to work without flash. Not only do you eliminate the chance of
red-eye, you get softer, more even light than a built-in flash typically 
produces.
55
Chapter 2: The Digital Photographer’s Troubleshooting Guide
Evaluating exposure on your camera monitor
Many digital cameras enable you to adjust the
brightness of the camera monitor. If you do,
keep that adjustment in mind when you evalu-
ate exposure on the monitor. For example, if you
set the monitor to a very bright setting, a picture
that’s actually underexposed may look just fine
on the monitor. The reverse is also true.
Some cameras offer a histogram display, a fea-
ture that provides a more accurate reflection of
exposure. A histogram is a graph that plots out
the brightness values in the image, from white
to black. (You can read more about histograms
in the Chapter 4 discussion about exposure cor-
rection.) If your camera doesn’t offer a his-
togram, take some test shots and then compare
the brightness of the images on your camera
monitor with what you see on your computer
monitor. Then you’ll better know how to inter-
pret exposure when reviewing pictures on your
camera. Of course, this assumes that your com-
puter monitor is properly calibrated, too.
Chapter 10 talks more about this issue.

56
Part I: Digital Demystified 
Figure 2-15: In autoflash mode, the flash didn’t fire because of bright 
ambient light, leaving the subject underexposed.
Figure 2-16: Setting the flash to fill (or force) flash mode adds just the 
right pop of light to illuminate the face.

 Switch to red-eye reduction mode when using flash is unavoidable.
Red-eye occurs when the light from the flash is reflected back from the
subject’s retinas. In red-eye reduction mode, the camera emits a small
burst of light prior to firing the real flash. The idea is that the subject’s
pupils constrict in reaction to the prelight, lessening the amount of 
light that can enter said pupils and then be reflected by the main 
flash. (Now you know why you rarely get red-eye when using flash 
outdoors — the pupils are already constricted to accommodate the
ambient daylight.)
A couple of comments about red-eye flash mode: First and foremost,
warn your subjects not to move or stop smiling until after the second
flash of light. Most people see the preflash and think that the picture 
has just been taken. Second, don’t expect this mode to eliminate all red-
eye; it just can’t. If you do get red-eye, see Chapter 5 to find out how to
quickly eradicate it in your photo editor.
Fixing Focus Flubs
Poorly focused pictures can occur for a number of reasons. The following
section offers solutions for the most common causes of the blurs. After that,
you can find out how to manipulate depth of field to bring more or less of
your scene into sharp focus.
Shooting sharper pictures
You can capture a sharper image by using the following strategies:
 Lock in autofocus correctly. Frame the picture and depress the shutter
button halfway, wait for the camera to signal that focus has been set,
and then depress the shutter button the rest of the way. (For more
details about this technique, see the earlier section, “Getting Good
Results in Automatic Mode.”)
Also be sure that your subject is within the selected focusing zone. Your
camera manual should illustrate all the focus-zone options that are avail-
able on your model.
 Stay within the camera-to-subject focusing distance. Every lens has a
certain focusing limit. Your manual should tell you the minimum dis-
tance at which you can focus on your subject. Most point-and-shoot
camera lenses are limited only at the close-focusing range — meaning
that they’re designed to focus on anything from a short distance away 
to infinity.
57
Chapter 2: The Digital Photographer’s Troubleshooting Guide

58
Part I: Digital Demystified 
For close-up shots, you may need to switch your camera to macro mode,
which is usually indicated by a little flower symbol. Again, check your
manual for the specifics on using this mode.
 Keep the camera still during the entire exposure. Any camera move-
ment during the time that the shutter is open may result in a blurred
image. When you shoot at a slow shutter speed, use a tripod or some
other method to steady the camera to avoid camera shake.
If you don’t want to carry a full-size tripod with you, consider one of the
more portable solutions shown in Figure 2-17. The left image shows the
Gorillapod (www.joby.com), which has twisty legs that can wrap around
almost any surface; and The Pod (www.bogen.com), a beanbag-like
device that can steady the camera even on non-level surfaces.
 Enable image stabilization, if available. Some cameras offer this fea-
ture, which is designed to compensate for small amounts of camera
shake. This feature is also known as anti-shake, steady shot, and other
such names depending on the manufacturer. Be sure to read your
manual to find out how the feature is implemented. With some cameras,
turning on this feature simply increases the shutter speed so that you
need to hold the camera still for a shorter period of time. Depending on
your subject matter, a faster shutter may or may not be appropriate.
And on some cameras, turning on image stabilization may increase the
possibility of noise because the camera automatically raises the ISO set-
ting to allow for that faster shutter. (See the earlier section “Deadening
noise” for more details on this image defect.)

Figure 2-17: Small, portable gadgets like the Gorillapod (left) and The Pod (right) provide
convenient alternatives to a full-size tripod.

 Press, don’t jab, the shutter button. A jerky shutter-button press can
create just enough shake to cause image blur. If you want to avoid this
possibility altogether, you can set the camera to self-timer mode, which
enables you to take a hands-free picture. Some cameras also offer a
remote shutter-button release that serves the same purpose.
 Increase the shutter speed if the subject is moving. As illustrated in
the earlier section, “Affecting focus with aperture and shutter speed,”
you need a fast shutter speed to freeze a moving subject in place. 
If your camera doesn’t offer manual shutter control or shutter-priority
autoexposure, look for a sports or action creative scene mode. This
mode is designed to produce the camera’s fastest shutter speed.
Controlling the range of focus
Expert photographers work not just to keep their subjects in focus, but also
to manipulate depth of field to their creative advantage. Depth of field, again,
refers to the range of distance that is sharply focused.
You can manipulate depth of field in three ways:
 Adjust the aperture (f-stop). As illustrated earlier, in Figure 2-11, a smaller
aperture — higher f-stop number — produces a greater depth of field,
bringing more of the scene into focus. 
Don’t have an aperture control on your camera? Try using the portrait
scene mode, if available, when you want a short depth of field. And
switch to landscape mode for a long depth of field.
 Zoom in or out. With an optical zoom lens — not a digital zoom — 
zooming in increases the lens focal length, which shortens the apparent
depth of field. (Chapter 1 introduces you to focal length.) So if you want
more of your scene to be in focus, zoom out. Of course, changing the
focal length also affects the angle of view and the size relationship of
objects in the scene.
 Change the camera-to-subject distance. The closer you get to your sub-
ject, the shallower the depth of field. In Figure 2-18, I used the same focal
length (zoom setting) and aperture for both images; I simply got closer
to the water lily to capture the second photo. Notice that the red stems
behind the flower appear much more softly focused in the close-range
photo.
59
Chapter 2: The Digital Photographer’s Troubleshooting Guide

60
Part I: Digital Demystified 
Figure 2-18: For the right picture, I moved closer to the water lily to shorten depth of field.
Putting it all together, then — and believe me, I know this is all overwhelming
at first, but pretty soon it’ll be second nature:
 To maximize depth of field: Zoom out, move farther from your subject,
and choose a higher f-stop (smaller aperture).
 To minimize depth of field: Zoom in, get closer, and open the aperture
by choosing a smaller f-stop number.
Solving Color Miscues
Are your whites looking dingy yellow — or maybe an odd shade of blue,
green, or pink? Well, assuming that we’re talking about your digital photos
and not your should-be-tidy whities, the problem is related to a feature
known as white balancing.
Like video cameras, digital cameras use a white-balancing system to compen-
sate for the color tints that are emitted by various light sources. Fluorescent
light emits a bluish cast, for example, and incandescent bulbs create a slightly
warm cast. Without white balancing, your image colors would be influenced
by the color tendencies of the light source.

Usually, the automatic white balance setting on your camera handles its task
well, keeping your whites white and all your other colors true as well. But
some light situations can confuse the camera.
A subject that is lit by multiple types of lights is probably the most common
white-balance culprit. For example, when I shoot still-life pictures in my
studio, I light the scene with photography lamps that use tungsten bulbs
(similar to incandescent bulbs). But enough daylight filters through the win-
dows to throw the camera off. As a result, the automatic white-balance set-
ting results in a yellowish cast to my pictures, as shown in the left example 
in Figure 2-19.
For times when automatic white balancing doesn’t work, most cameras
enable you to select from several manual settings, each designed for a spe-
cific type of light. Check your manual to discover the white-balance options
available to you and how to implement them. In my case, changing the white-
balance control to the Incandescent setting removed the yellowish color cast.
Figure 2-19: Multiple light sources confused the white-balance system in automatic mode (left); manually
setting the white balance fixed the problem (right).

very creative endeavor involves a little less-than-exciting prep work.
Before you can cook a gourmet vegetable stir fry, for example, you have
to stand in line at the grocery store, clean and chop the vegetables, and mea-
sure out all the herbs and spices.
Likewise, you need to take some preliminary steps to prepare
your digital picture files for the various creative uses you
have in mind. First, of course, you have to get those picture
files off of your digital camera memory card and into the
computer — probably one of the more confusing
aspects of digital photography. Then you need to
open the photos in a photo editor and set their print
dimensions and resolution or, if the images are des-
tined for the Web, their display size. Finally, you
must save your edited files in the appropriate image
format.
Just as mindlessly adding cayenne pepper instead of
paprika can ruin a stir-fry, inattention to detail during
this picture-prep process can affect the quality of your
finished project, so this chapter walks you through each of
the critical steps. In addition, the pages to come offer some
advice about the best ways to archive your digital pictures to
ensure that they survive for generations.

Transferring Pictures to Your Computer
Getting pictures from a digital camera to a computer isn’t difficult, but the
software tools for the job vary so widely that it’s impossible for me to pro-
vide you with very specific instructions on what to click and when to click it.
However, I can give you a generic overview of the two main options for photo
transfer: connecting your camera directly to your computer and using a
memory-card reader. My hope is that this background will enable you to
adapt these steps to whatever transfer software you use.
Linking camera and computer via USB
All digital cameras sold today ship with a USB cable, shown in Figure 3-1,
and all computers sold within the past few years have at least one USB port
(the slot where you insert the end of the cable).
USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. You don’t really need to know that, but
you can drop it into a conversation with your computer-geek friends if you
want to impress them.
Figure 3-1: You can connect the camera to the computer via a USB cable.
USB plug
USB port

When those geek friends aren’t around, dig out your camera manual if you plan
to use this method of image transfer. (Really, you’ll save time and frustration
in the long run if you don’t just wing it.) Look for specifics on the following:
 Camera software installation: You may need to install software that
shipped with the camera before the computer and camera can communi-
cate. The piece of software in question is sometimes referred to as a
TWAIN driver. Note that the driver usually is provided as an independent
installation option, so you don’t have to install any photo-editing soft-
ware that also shipped with the camera if you don’t want to.
 Transfer setting: You must set the camera to
the computer-transfer function, typically
accessed via a camera dial and often indicated
by the little two-way arrow icon you see in
Figure 3-2. After you select this setting, the
camera menus may display further options for
transfer.
 Connection order: Usually, you plug the cable
into the camera, turn on the camera, and then
plug the other end of the cable into the com-
puter. But this step varies, so double-check.
To save battery life, power the camera via an
AC adapter, if your camera came with one.
After you connect the camera to the computer, a window may pop up auto-
matically, providing you with tools and options for transferring your photos.
This offer to help may come from your photo editor, your camera’s software,
or a utility provided with your computer’s operating system.
For example, if you use Photoshop Elements for Windows, you may see the
window shown in Figure 3-3. Windows users may instead see the window
shown in Figure 3-4, from which you can access the Windows Camera
and Scanner Wizard. (A wizard, for the uninitiated, is a little program that
walks you step by step through a particular process.) On the Mac side, a pro-
gram called iPhoto usually comes to life and offers to handle your picture
downloads.
With any of these programs, you typically just specify where you want your
picture files stored (write down the folder you choose so you can find it
later), and the software takes things from there. Be on the alert for these two
additional options, though:
 Delete after downloading: If the software asks whether you want to
delete pictures from your memory card after downloading, say no.
Always check to make sure that the pictures have made it to your 
computer in good shape before dumping them from your memory card.
65
Chapter 3: Working with Your Picture Files
Computer transfer setting
Figure 3-2: The image-transfer
setting is often represented by
this double-arrow icon.

66
Part I: Digital Demystified 
And delete files by using the camera, not your computer, which some-
times can mess things up.
 Automatic red-eye correction: The Adobe Photo Downloader, for one,
offers this option. Automated red-eye fixers work fine sometimes, but
other times they mess up your image. So instead, use the technique dis-
cussed in Chapter 5 to remove red-eye in your photo editor.
Don’t panic if nothing happens after you connect your camera. Your com-
puter just may not be set up to let you know automatically that it found your
camera. Move on to the next section and follow the same steps but look for
your camera to appear as a drive or drive icon instead of the card reader in
Step 3. If the camera doesn’t show up, something’s amiss with your connec-
tion, camera setting, or both; double-check the manual for troubleshooting
ideas.
If you don’t want Elements to pop up the photo downloader automatically,
you can disable this feature. Open the Elements Organizer window and then
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Camera or Card Reader. In the dialog box that
appears, you can find options that both turn off the autolaunch and the auto-
matic red-eye fix.
Figure 3-3: The Adobe Photo Downloader appears automatically 
if you use Photoshop Elements for Windows.

Figure 3-4: Windows may display this list of options 
when you attach your camera to a computer.
Using a card reader
The main drawback to transferring pictures directly from your camera is that
you consume battery power because the camera must be turned on during
the entire transfer process. As an
alternative, you can buy a memory-
card reader and attach it to your
computer via a USB connection.
When you want to transfer pictures,
you take your memory card out of
the camera and pop it into the slot in
the card reader. Then you just drag
and drop the files from the card to
your hard drive, much like you may
have done eons ago to transfer files
from a floppy disk.
Card readers are inexpensive; you
can buy a reader that accepts multi-
ple types of memory cards, such
as the SanDisk model shown in
Figure 3-5, for about $30, or a single-
format reader for about $10. But if
your computer is fairly new, you
may not need to spend anything —
many systems now offer built-in
card readers. Many photo printers

Figure 3-5: This SanDisk card reader accepts
several types of camera memory. 

68
Part I: Digital Demystified 
also offer this convenience. Just be sure that the built-in readers accept
the type of memory card that your camera uses (SD, CompactFlash, and
so on).
To transfer pictures using a card reader, first install whatever software came
with the reader. Then take these steps:
1. Start your computer.
2. Insert the memory card into the card reader.
Be gentle! Jamming or forcing the card into the slot can damage both the
card and the reader. Check the instruction manual to make sure that the
card is oriented in the proper direction.
Depending on what software is installed on your computer, inserting a
memory card may launch a picture-transfer wizard; see the preceding
section to find out what to do next. If you don’t see a wizard, move on to
Step 3.
3. Using Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder, locate the card reader’s
drive (or drives).
Your computer considers your card reader to be just another drive on
your system. (If your camera is connected to the computer, it should
also appear as a drive.) To locate the drive, take these steps: 
• Windows: Click the Windows Start button and then choose All
Programs➪Accessories➪Windows Explorer. Or, if you see a My
Computer icon on your desktop, right-click the icon and choose
Explore from the pop-up menu. You should see a window that
looks something like the one in Figure 3-6. A drive letter appears
for each of the card reader’s slots. For example, my reader has
four slots, and Explorer displays them as drives F, G, H, and I.
(The drive letters vary depending on how many other drives exist
on your computer.) You may or may not see the camera name dis-
played with the drive as in Figure 3-6.
If you don’t see the window in Figure 3-6, be sure that you launched
Windows Explorer and not Microsoft Internet Explorer, which you
use to browse the Web. Hey, you wouldn’t want them to make
things so obvious that you could do without my help, would you?
(Be kind.)
• Mac: Navigate to the Finder level. Your memory card should
appear as an icon on the desktop, as shown in Figure 3-7. The drive
may or may not be assigned a specific name or show your camera
name, depending on the reader and camera.

Figure 3-6: Windows Explorer displays a drive letter for each slot on the card reader.
4. Navigate to the folder on the reader drive that holds your images and
then open that folder.
Normally, the images are stored inside a folder labeled DCIM, as shown
in Figures 3-6 and 3-7. 
In Windows, choose View➪Thumbnails to display thumbnails of your
image files, as you see them in Figure 3-6.
Card reader drives

Chapter 3: Working with Your Picture Files

Part I: Digital Demystified 
Figure 3-7: On a Mac, the card reader appears as a drive icon on the Finder desktop.
5. Drag and drop the image files to a folder on your hard drive, as
shown in Figure 3-8.
Where you store your picture files is completely up to you. I created a
folder called Images on my main hard drive to hold all my pictures. I
then created subfolders to hold different types of pictures, as you see in
Figure 3-8. Windows users may instead prefer to use the My Pictures
folder, which is where most photo-editing programs look first to locate
image files. But it really doesn’t matter, so use the organization system
that makes sense to you. 
To select all files on the memory card, click in the list of image files and
then press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A (Mac). To select several, but not all
files, click the first file and then Ctrl-click (Windows) or Ô-click (Mac)
the other files one by one.
When you drag your files, you should see a little plus sign next to your
cursor, as shown in Figure 3-8. The plus sign indicates that you’re copy-
ing your files, not moving them — which means that the originals will
remain on your memory card.
Card reader icon

Figure 3-8: Select the files you want to copy and drag them to the folder where 
you want to store them.
6. In Windows, shut down Explorer and then remove the memory card
from the card reader.
Removing the card while Explorer is still running sometimes causes the
program to crash.
On a Mac, drag the card icon to the Trash icon to eject the drive and
then remove the memory card from the reader.
If you don’t, your Mac will chastise you for not following the ejecting
procedure.
Never remove the memory card while the computer is still accessing it.
Doing so can ruin the card and destroy any files on it. The same applies to
disconnecting your camera from the computer, if you go that route.

Opening Picture Files
To open a digital photo in most photo-editing programs, you choose the
Open command, usually found on the File menu. This command displays
the Open dialog box, which, again, looks and works the same as all the other
Open dialog boxes you’ve probably encountered. Figure 3-9 shows the
Windows XP version of this dialog box. Click the name of the picture you
want to open and then click the Open button.
In some photo programs, however, the Open command may instead be
named something such as Get Photos. Or, you may need to navigate to a sec-
ondary menu off the File➪Open command to access pictures. Check your
software’s Help system for details if you can’t find the right command.
If you’re brand new to computers as well as to digital imaging, the whole topic
of opening, moving, and managing files can be pretty confusing. Unfortunately,
that’s a subject beyond the scope of this book, so I highly recommend that
you get a beginner’s guide to your operating system (Windows or Mac) so
that you can get a better understanding of how your computer thinks. 
Figure 3-9: You open picture files just as you do any computer file.

In the meantime, here are a few additional file-opening tips that relate just to
opening pictures in a photo program: 
 Helping your computer work faster: You can open pictures directly
from your camera, a memory-card reader, or a CD. However, if you plan
to edit your photos, copy the pictures to your computer’s main hard
drive and work on those copies instead. A computer usually can process
files located on an internal hard drive more quickly than it can work with
files on an external drive or storage device. Follow the instructions in
the preceding sections to copy the files to your hard drive.
 Linking your photo organizer program and editing program: While
browsing your pictures in most photo-organizing programs, you can
instruct the organizer program to open a selected picture in your photo
editor. In the Organizer program provided with the Windows version of
Photoshop Elements, for example, you can click the Edit button on the
toolbar and then choose Go to Full Edit to open the photo in the Elements
workspace, as shown in Figure 3-10. Depending on the organizer, you
may need to specify in the program preferences which program you
want to use to edit your photos.
Figure 3-10: In Elements, you can send a picture from the Organizer to the editing workspace
by choosing Go to Full Edit.

 Converting Camera Raw files: If you set your digital camera to capture
images in the Camera Raw format, clicking the Open button in the Open
dialog box takes you to an intermediate file-opening step. You must use a
Raw converter utility to specify how you want to translate the Raw image
data into a common picture-file format. (See Chapter 1 for an introduction
to Camera Raw.) Some photo programs provide their own Raw converter;
Figure 3-11 shows the Photoshop Elements version. You can also use the
camera manufacturer’s own converter, usually provided on the software
CD that ships in the camera box.
The DVD included at the back of this book contains a QuickTime tutorial
that explains how to use the Adobe Camera Raw converter provided
with Photoshop Elements.
Figure 3-11: Opening a Camera Raw file in Elements takes you to the Adobe Camera Raw
converter window.

Protecting Your Digital Images
The preservation of digital files is a hot topic in the photo industry these
days. Many experts are concerned that because of the fast-changing nature of
technology, the imaging equipment of the future may not be able to open the
picture files that digital photographers create today. (Think Betamax video-
tapes and 8-track audio cassettes.)
What’s usually overlooked in this discussion is that film photography pre-
sents just as much, if not more, risk to the lifespan of a picture. After all, most
people aren’t exactly careful about how they store photos and negatives —
can you even find the negatives of your most precious pictures? And do
you have all your family photographs archivally framed and hung in a light-
controlled environment to guard against fading?
That’s not to suggest, however, that you don’t need to take steps to protect
your digital image files. The following sections tell you how to ensure the
long life of your digital originals as well as how to save any changes you make
to those pictures in your photo editor. 
Archiving your picture files
Let me start by warning you away from data-storage devices that are not reli-
able for long-term safekeeping of your picture files:
 Your camera’s memory card (or any memory card)
 A removable flash drive, like those tiny USB key drives that are all the
rage today
 Your computer’s hard drive
 An external hard drive
 A multimedia player such as one of those flashy portable devices that
can play movies, MP3 audio files, and pictures
 Zip disks, a Microdrive, or any of the other high-capacity removable
storage drives and disks that may be hanging around your office
All these devices use storage technology that is simply too prone to failure,
breakage, and accidental erasure to provide long-term protection for your
important pictures.

So what’s the solution? Here’s my best advice:
 For picture files that you absolutely, positively want to give the best
chance of survival, go with non-rewritable CD-ROMs. They’re labeled 
CD-R, not CD-RW. (The RW means that you can overwrite the files on the
disc with other files.) And buy high-quality, gold-coated discs, not the
cheapo store brands. Yes, there is a difference, and it’s worth paying for.
 For all your other picture files, you can also copy the pictures to a DVD.
Again, a non-rewritable DVD (that’s either DVD-R or DVD+R) ensures that
you don’t accidentally erase the pictures on the disc.
I don’t recommend DVD yet for critical-image storage because the industry
hasn’t settled on a single DVD format. So there’s a chance that the DVDs you
burn on your current computer may not play on next year’s model. When a
clear winner emerges, however, DVDs probably will replace CDs as the media
of choice because they offer a much greater storage capacity. The good news
is that most DVD players can play CDs as well as DVDs.
If you don’t want to mess with burning your own CDs or DVDs, most retail
photo labs and online photo services can do it for you.
Saving works in progress
When you make changes to your pictures in a photo editor, you must remem-
ber to save the altered file before closing the image. (Most programs prompt
you do to so.) If you’re making a lot of changes, you should also save the file
periodically so that if your system crashes, you don’t lose your work.
Here are the critical facts to know about saving your photo files:
 Save versus Save As: Both commands are typically found on the File
menu, but they approach the save process differently. With File➪Save,
you overwrite the open picture file, usually without being presented
with any dialog box or other message. (This assumes that you’re work-
ing with an existing file rather than one you just created anew or
scanned into your photo editor.)
With Save As, the program opens a dialog box in which you can specify a
new name, file format, storage location, and so on. Figure 3-12 shows the
Save As dialog box that appears when you use the Windows version of
Photoshop Elements.
 File format: You can save a picture file in many different formats, but
you should always save your works-in-progress in the TIFF format or, if
you use Elements (or Photoshop), the Photoshop format, PSD. Both for-
mats are lossless, which means that they preserve all your picture data.

Never resave an edited photo in the JPEG format because doing so
results in data loss that can damage your image. (Merely opening, view-
ing, and closing the file doesn’t do any harm, however.) If you need a
JPEG file for online use, create a copy of your finished image by follow-
ing the instructions later in this chapter.
 Program-specific save options: Your Save As dialog box may contain
some options that relate just to your photo software. In Elements, for
example, you see the Layers check box as well as a few additional
options, as shown in Figure 3-12. Because the options vary widely among
photo software, I must direct you to your program’s Help system for
details on these options. For Elements users, Chapter 5 contains some
information about the Layers option, however.
Figure 3-12: Some file-saving options are specific to the photo software.

Undoing mistakes
Up to the time that you save or close an edited picture, you can undo almost
any change you made. Use these go-back options:
 Edit➪Undo: This command takes you back one step in time, undoing
whatever you just did to your picture. In many programs, including
Elements, you can keep choosing the command to undo a series of bad
moves. For times when you change your mind about your undo, Elements
and most other programs offer an Edit➪Redo command, which restores
the most recent change that you reversed. 
 Revert: This command, found on the Edit menu in Elements and some-
times on the File command in other programs, restores the picture to
the way it appeared immediately after you last saved it.
 Close without saving: If you simply close the image and don’t save your
changes, you undo any changes made since the last time you saved the
file. In other words, this step does the same thing as Revert except that
Revert leaves your picture file open.
If you use Elements, also check out the Undo History palette, where you can
view a list of your most recent changes and then undo multiple steps more
quickly than you can by choosing the Undo command repeatedly. The Elements
Help System tells you what you need to know to take advantage of this feature.
Preparing a Picture for Print
Whether you need to take any preparatory steps before printing your pic-
tures depends on how you plan to put those puppies on paper. No prep work
is necessary if you’re taking your files to a retail photo lab for printing; just
be sure that you follow the lab’s recommendations for how large you can
print your photo, given the number of pixels in the image file. (See Chapter 1
for an introduction to pixels and their relationship to print quality and size.)
If you want to print your own photos or use them in a print publishing pro-
gram, however, prepare the files as outlined in the next two sections. 
Setting print dimensions and resolution
Before you choose the Print command in your photo-editing program, you
should set the output dimensions and resolution (pixels per inch) of your
image. To do so in Photoshop Elements, take these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
You see the Image Size dialog box, shown in Figure 3-13.

Figure 3-13: To avoid degrading your image, turn off resampling.
2. Turn off the Resample Image check box.
This step prevents you from adding or deleting pixels to or from your
photo, a dangerous option that you can explore in Chapter 2.
3. Enter your desired print height or width.
When you type a value in the Width box, the Height value changes 
automatically, and vice versa. This restriction maintains the original 
proportions of your photo.
Additionally, you see the Resolution value change as you adjust the
width or height because changing the dimensions of the photo changes
the number of pixels per inch. Remember, for a good quality print, you
should aim for at least 200 pixels per inch (ppi).
What if the Resolution value is lower than 200 ppi at your desired print
dimensions? Unfortunately, there is no magic fix. You simply have to
decide whether print size or quality is more critical to your project.
Don’t try to add pixels to make up the difference — as illustrated in
Chapter 2, you don’t gain anything and you may make the picture
quality worse.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.

Chapter 3: Working with Your Picture Files

Part I: Digital Demystified 
Now you’re ready to ship that picture file off to the printer, which you can do
by choosing the Print command, usually found on the File menu. The dialog
box that appears next varies depending on what photo software you use and
whether your computer is a PC or a Mac, so again, I must refer you to your
program’s Help system for detailed explanations.
Whatever software you use, don’t take advantage of any options that scale
your photo — change the print size, in everyday lingo. Otherwise, you
change the output resolution of the photo, undoing all the work you did in
the preceding steps. Whether the resolution change resamples the image
depends on the photo software.
Saving a TIFF copy for publication
When you’re asked to submit a
photo for use in a newsletter,
magazine, or other print publi-
cation, you may be required to
provide the image file in the
TIFF format. You also need to
create a TIFF copy of your image
to use it in most desktop pub-
lishing programs (such as
Microsoft Publisher).
To do so, use the File➪Save As
command that I explain in
the “Saving works in process”
section, earlier in this chapter.
When you save the file, you
may see a second dialog box
similar to the one shown in
Figure 3-14.
Some TIFF options can affect the
file’s compatibility with some
publishing programs. So follow
these guidelines:
 Turn off file compression, if
available.
 For Pixel Order, choose
Interleaved. Trust me, you don’t want to know the details.
Figure 3-14: Save TIFF files with no compression and
no layers to avoid conflicts with some publishing
programs.

 Set the Byte Order according to whether the person who requested the
file uses a Windows PC or a Mac computer. If you don’t know, stick with
the one that matches your operating system. 
 If your picture contains layers, also choose the option that merges all
the layers into one. (In Elements, choose Discard Layers and Save a
Copy.) Many publishing programs can’t open layered TIFF files.
Preparing Photos for the Web
Getting pictures ready for online use — or for any on-screen use, really —
involves two steps: setting the picture display size and saving the resized file
in the Web-friendly JPEG format. The next section explains some background
about sizing pictures for screen display; following that, I show you how to
use a tool called a JPEG optimizer to set the picture size and create your JPEG
file at the same time.
Understanding screen display size
A computer monitor can display a limited number of pixels. For most 
monitors, the maximum screen display size is around 1600 x 1200 pixels —
and that’s much higher than most people use. I run my 19-inch monitor 
at a setting that displays 1024 x 768 pixels, for example. (As you lower the
display setting, text and other on-screen objects get larger and easier to
view.) 
Unless you’re dealing with a very low-resolution original, you probably need
to dump pixels to properly size the photo for screen display. For example,
Figure 3-15 shows you how a 6-megapixel image appears when attached to
an e-mail message and viewed on a monitor set to the 1024 x 768 display.
The picture, which has a pixel count of more than 3000 x 2000 pixels, is much
too large to be viewed without scrolling. In addition, all those pixels make for
a large file and a long download time.
To stay within safe viewing limits, follow these size guidelines:
 E-mail photos: For pictures that you want to share via e-mail, use a 
maximum size of 450 pixels wide and 400 pixels tall. This size ensures
that the entire image can be viewed without scrolling, as shown in
Figure 3-16, and also significantly reduces the time required to download
the picture.
81
Chapter 3: Working with Your Picture Files

82
Part I: Digital Demystified 
 Web site photos: For a picture that you plan to use on a Web site, size
the picture according to the page layout. If you aren’t the one designing
and maintaining the page, call the person who plays that role to find out
what size to use.
 Presentation photos: If you’re preparing a picture for a multimedia 
presentation that will be given via a digital projector, find out the res-
olution of the projector. Then set the image display size accordingly.
For example, if the projector has a resolution of 1280 x 1024 and
you want your picture to fill the entire screen, set the picture size to
1280 x 1024 pixels.
Finally, remember that pixel count has no effect on the quality of on-screen
pictures, only on the size at which the image appears on-screen. In other
words, the rules are different for screen images than they are for prints.
However — and this is an important however — if you’re sending a picture
file to someone who needs to produce a good print from the file, size the
photo according to the print guidelines I provide earlier in the chapter, in the
section “Setting print dimensions and resolution.” The same holds true if
you’re uploading pictures to an online album site from which you want to
order prints.
Figure 3-15: This 6-megapixel image is much too large for on-screen viewing.

Figure 3-16: I reduced the pixel count significantly so that the entire picture is visible in the
e-mail window.
Saving your JPEG copies
Many photo programs offer something that geeks like me refer to as a JPEG
optimizer. With this tool, you can set your image display size and make a
JPEG copy of the image all at once. But the more important benefit of a JPEG
optimizer is that it contains previews that enable you to see how your image
will appear at different JPEG quality settings.
Chapters 1 and 2 explain the JPEG format fully so I won’t go into it all again
here. Just remember that saving a picture in the JPEG format results in some
of your picture data being dumped in order to create smaller files. This process
is called lossy compression. And if you toss lots of picture data, your image
quality becomes, well, stinky. So your goal when preparing Web images is to
find the optimum balance between file size and image quality — hence, the
term JPEG optimizer.
The following steps show you how to use the Photoshop Elements version of
this tool. If you don’t use Elements, the controls in your optimizer should be
very much the same, although how you access them may vary.

1. Open the picture that you want to prepare for the Web.
2. If you made changes to the image that you haven’t yet saved, do so now.
Save the file in a lossless format such as TIFF or, in Elements, PSD.
3. Choose File➪Save for Web.
You see the Save for Web dialog box shown in Figure 3-17. The dialog
box contains two previews: On the left, you see the original image, and
on the right, you see how the image will appear if you save it at the cur-
rent dialog box settings. Below the second preview, you see the approxi-
mate file size and download time for the “after” images.
Figure 3-17: The Save for Web tool enables you to preview your image at different JPEG quality settings.
Click to open Preview menu
Hand tool
Zoom tool

You can adjust the preview setup as follows:
• Adjust the preview magnification: Click either preview with the
Zoom tool, labeled in Figure 3-17. To zoom out, hold down the
Alt key (Windows) or the Option key (Mac) as you click with the
Zoom tool.
• Scroll the preview display: Drag inside either preview with the Hand
tool, also labeled in Figure 3-17.
• Adjust the modem speed for the download time preview: The down-
load speed value shown beneath the right preview relates to a spe-
cific modem speed. By clicking the little triangle button labeled in
Figure 3-17, you open a menu from which you can select a different
modem speed.
Unless you’re preparing a picture that you plan to share only with
people who have a high-speed Internet connection, set the preview
to a modem speed of 56.6 Kbps (kilobytes per second). Currently,
this is the slowest modem speed of most dial-up connections —
the lowest common denominator, if math terms help.
4. Set the image display size in
the New Size area of the dialog
box, featured in Figure 3-18.
Before you do anything else,
turn on the Constrain
Proportions box so that you
retain the original proportions
of the image when you resize it.
Then enter either the new
width or height — measured
in pixels — into the Width or
Height box. When you enter
either value, the other updates
automatically to keep the image
proportional.
5. Click the Apply button under-
neath the Width and Height
boxes to make the change in pixel count official.
After you click the button, the file size and download time shown for the
after preview should both go down. If they don’t, you forgot to click that
Apply button. (I do it all the time, which is why I bring it up.)

6. Select JPEG from the format
drop-down list highlighted in
Figure 3-19.
The list contains choices of all
the available Web image for-
mats; JPEG is the best option, so
don’t stray from the plan.
7. Set the image quality by using
the two controls shown in
Figure 3-19.
You can either select a quality
range from the drop-down list
on the left or select a specific
quality value from the Quality
option to the right. As you
adjust the quality settings, the
image preview updates to show
you the effect on file size and picture quality. You may want to zoom in
on the image so that you can spot any serious degradation, which may
not be visible at a long view.
8. Deselect the Progressive and ICC Profile boxes.
Both options can cause problems for certain browsers and don’t offer
benefits worth the risk.
The Matte setting has no impact unless the bottom layer of your photo
contains transparent pixels. That’s an advanced option that I don’t cover
in this book, but if your photo does have transparent pixels, use the
Matte option to select a color to fill the transparent areas. The JPEG
format can’t handle transparency.
9. Click OK to close the Save for Web dialog box.
You see a standard Save As dialog box.
10. Choose a filename and storage location as usual.
The format, JPEG, is already selected for you.
If your original image is also in the JPEG format, be careful not to use the
same name, or you will overwrite that original. I add the word Web to
the end of my filenames so that I know that a picture file has been pre-
pared for online use.
11. Click Save to close the dialog box.
You return to the Elements main window, where your original picture
remains on-screen. Close the picture without saving it (assuming that
you saved the image in Step 2, as instructed). To view your JPEG copy,
open it from the location where you just stored it.

In addition, the beginning of the chapter explains select-
ing, which is a step you can take to limit the effects of any
corrective filters or tools to a specific part of your image.
Selecting the Area to Alter
All the examples in upcoming sections of this chapter assume that your entire
photo needs adjusting. But often, you need to correct only a portion of your
picture. To apply a correction filter or tool just to that area, leaving the rest
of the image untouched, you must perform a preliminary step called selecting.

This process is similar to using your cursor to highlight a word you want to
edit in a word-processing program. But in photo-editing programs, you use a
selection tool to draw a dotted selection outline around the pixels you want to
alter.
Photoshop Elements, like most photo-editing programs, offers you a variety
of tools for creating a selection outline. The following steps show you how
to use the most flexible and capable of these tools, the Selection Brush.
(Don’t be intimidated by the length of the steps; it takes lots of words to fully
describe this tool, but it’s actually very easy to use.)
1. Choose the Selection Brush, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1: To open a tool flyout menu, press and hold on the little triangle.
Flyout menu triangle
Mode control

The tool shares a toolbox slot with the Magic Selection Brush. If you see
the Magic Selection Brush instead of the Selection Brush in the toolbox,
put your cursor over the little black triangle in the lower-right corner of
the tool icon and then hold down your mouse button. This action reveals
a flyout menu. Click the Selection Brush as shown in Figure 4-1 to make
it the active tool.
2. On the options bar, set the Mode control to Selection, as shown in
Figure 4-1.
The Selection Brush offers two modes, Selection and Mask. I suggest
that you start in Selection mode to draw a rough outline (as explained in
Steps 3 through 5) and then switch to Mask mode to refine the outline if
you need to precisely select an object or area. (See Steps 6 through 9.) 
3. Open the Brushes palette and choose any round brush.
To open the palette, labeled in Figure 4-2, click the brush icon on the
options bar, also labeled in the figure. Inside the palette, make sure that
the Default Brushes option is selected from the Brushes drop-down list.
Then click any of the first several brushes in the palette, as shown in the
figure. You don’t need to worry about a specific brush size or hardness
yet; just be sure to select a round brush and not one of the specialty
brushes found near the end of the brush list.
The figure shows the default palette display. If you changed the display,
your brush icons may look different from what you see in the figures in
this book.

4. Adjust the Hardness control on the options bar if necessary.
When you work with the Selection Brush, the Hardness control deter-
mines whether the edges of the selection outline you create are feathered,
which in turn impacts the results of the filter or other change you then
apply to the selected area. Here’s the scoop:
• Use a low Hardness value for a feathered outline. With a feathered
outline, pixels become only partially selected near the edges of the
outline. When you then apply your correction filter or other change
to the image, that alteration fades out gradually at the edges of the
selected area. A Hardness value of 0 gives you the most feathering. 
• Set the Hardness value to 100 for a non-feathered outline. Now when
you apply your filter to the selected area, all pixels within the
selection outline receive the full impact of the change.
What Hardness value you should use depends on what you’re trying to
accomplish. For example, to apply a blur just to the background of the
example photo, use a non-feathered, or fully hard, outline so that no part
of the flower or butterfly receives the blur. But to apply an exposure
filter to brighten the center of the image more than the outside edges,
a feathered outline creates a more natural result because there is no
abrupt transition between the lightened and non-lightened areas.
When you use a feathered outline, you may need to experiment to find
the right feathering amount; no one value works for all projects and
images. Note that the selection outline appears the same whether you
use a feathered or unfeathered outline; you can’t see the difference until
you apply your subsequent filter or other correction.
5. Drag over the area you want to select.
As you drag, a dotted outline emerges from your cursor, as shown in
Figure 4-3. You don’t have to complete the entire outline in one drag —
you can stop and start as needed. You also can use the Size control on
the options bar to adjust the brush size as needed.
Keep dragging with the Selection Brush until the area you want to select
is entirely enclosed by the outline. In Figure 4-3, I drew a rough selection
outline around the flower and the butterfly.
If you need just a rough selection outline, you’re done. But if you need a
very precise outline, move on to Step 6.
6. To refine the outline, switch the tool’s Mode control to Mask.
This mode enables you to more precisely place the edges of the selec-
tion outline than the Selection mode.

Figure 4-3: Anything inside the dotted selection outline is selected and ready for editing. 
As soon as you switch to Mask mode, your selection outline disappears,
and the options bar controls change to those you see in Figure 4-4.
Anything that was formerly outside the selection outline you created
is covered by a red, translucent overlay, or mask. Think of this overlay
like the masking tape you put down over your baseboards before 
painting your walls — it protects the pixels it covers from being
changed.
If the color or opacity of the mask makes it difficult for you to distin-
guish the mask from your image pixels, use the Overlay Color and
Overlay Opacity controls on the options bar to adjust the mask 
appearance.

Figure 4-4: In Mask mode, you paint a red mask over areas that you don’t want to select.
7. Paint with the Selection Brush to perfect the mask.
Your goal is to extend the red mask over the pixels that you don’t want
to select and to remove it from those you do. You do this by painting
with your tool brush, as follows:
• To apply the mask paint: Click the Apply Paint icon labeled in
Figure 4-4 and then drag over areas that aren’t covered by the mask.
• To remove the mask paint: Click the Erase Paint icon and drag over
the masked areas.
Anything that’s covered by the red mask becomes deselected — or, more
accurately, will become deselected when you complete this process in
Step 9. And remember that you don’t see the dotted selection outline in
this mode.

8. When painting the borders of the mask, adjust the Hardness value if
needed.
The Hardness value that you set while painting the borders of your
mask determines whether you create a feathered or nonfeathered 
outline. As with Selection mode, use a value of 100% if you want a non-
feathered outline; a lower value produces a feathered outline. You can
adjust the Hardness for different parts of the outline; in this way, you
can create a selection outline that’s feathered in some areas and not in
others. In Figure 4-5, you can see me painting the border using a fully
hard brush.
I recommend that you paint the interior areas of your mask with the
Hardness value set to 100%, however; using a feathered brush tends to
leave some stray pixels selected even if they appear to be masked.
Figure 4-5: For a nonfeathered mask, paint the mask borders with the 
Hardness value set to 100%.

9. When you’re happy with
the mask, set the Mode
control on the options
bar back to Selection.
Now the mask disappears
and the blinking selection outline reappears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
Anything that was formerly covered by the red mask is outside the selec-
tion outline; anything that was formerly unmasked appears inside the
selection outline and is then ready for your next edit.
If the selection outline doesn’t look quite right, however, you can switch
back to Mask mode to further refine the mask. Keep switching between
the two modes until you’re sure the outline is where you want it.
Figure 4-6: My finished mask precisely covers only
the photo background, leaving the flower and butterfly
unmasked.
Customizing your Elements tool cursor
By default, the cursors for Photoshop Elements
tools resemble the tools’ icons in the toolbox.
You see a little paint brush when you work with
the Brush tool, for example. These cursors don’t
offer any indication of the brush size and shape,
so you don’t know what pixels your next brush
stroke will affect.
For a better option, visit the Display & Cursors
panel of the Preferences dialog box. In
Windows, open the dialog box by choosing
Edit➪Preferences➪Display & Cursors. On a Mac,
choose Photoshop Elements➪Preferences➪
Display & Cursors. Then set the Painting Cursors
option to Full Size Brush tip. Now your tool cursor
reflects the actual size and shape of your brush. 
I also set the Other Cursors option, found on the
same dialog box panel, to Precise. With this set-
ting, tools that don’t have adjustable brushes
display a simple crosshair cursor instead of the
icon-based cursor. Again, the crosshair cursor
makes it easier to see exactly what area you’re

Again, the Selection Brush is much easier to understand when you try it for

Just work through the steps one or two times using the sample image on the
DVD, and all should become clear.
In addition to the sample images, the DVD that comes with this book contains
QuickTime movies that show you how to use the Selection Brush and some of
the other Elements selection tools. The movie titled “Selection Basics” also
talks more about selection feathering and explains how to adjust an existing

Straightening a Crooked Photo
If you’ve ever traveled to Venice, Italy, you probably shot your first pictures
of that canal-laced city while riding in a water taxi to your hotel, as I did when
shooting the scene in Figure 4-8. And so you can appreciate my excuse for the

tilting horizon line in that picture — it’s not easy to keep the camera and
horizon level while bobbing along the waves.
Whether you have a good excuse or not, you can easily straighten your image
by rotating it slightly in your photo editor. Here’s how to do it in Photoshop
Elements:
1. Choose Select➪All to select your entire image.
You see the blinking selection outline around your picture.
2. Choose Image➪Rotate➪Free Rotate Selection.
The blinking outline is replaced by a solid outline that has little boxes,
called handles, around the perimeter, as shown in Figure 4-9. (If you
don’t see the outline or handles, maximize your image window or zoom
out by choosing View➪Zoom Out.) The options bar also changes to
show you the controls you see in the figure.
Figure 4-8: A crooked horizon line ruins my original Venice shot (left) but is easily repaired (right).

Figure 4-9: Drag outside a corner handle to rotate the photo.
3. Place your cursor outside one of the corner handles, as shown in
Figure 4-9.
The cursor should change into a curved, double-arrow handle, as you
see in the figure. 
4. Drag up or down to rotate the picture until the horizon is level.
If you have trouble getting the rotation right, try this trick: Double-
click inside the Rotate box on the options bar (labeled in Figure 4-10).
Then press the up-arrow key to nudge the picture clockwise; press the
down-arrow key to nudge it counter-clockwise. 
As you rotate the image, you reveal parts of the image canvas — the vir-
tual background on which every photo rests in Elements. In Figure 4-10,
the canvas is white.

Cropping to a Better Composition
Trimming away excess background can dramatically improve many pictures.
Figure 4-11 offers an example: The bright blue pool water in the background
distracts the eye from the subject, as does that turquoise frozen-treat thing
she has in her hand. Cropping the image tightly eliminates those flaws and
restores emphasis to the face, where it should be.
Before you crop, however, check your original pixel count and be sure that
you have enough pixels to even allow the crop. If you plan to print the image,
you need at least 200 pixels per linear inch of your print to get good print
quality. So if you start with a low-resolution image and then crop it to a small
area, you’re going to be disappointed with the resulting print. Chapter 3
shows you how to set print output size and pixels per inch (resolution).
Figure 4-11: Cropping can improve your image by eliminating distracting background elements.

If you also need to straighten the horizon line in your photo, tackle that job
first. (See the preceding section.) You lose some of your original image area
in the process of straightening the horizon, so you want to start that task
with an uncropped photo to give yourself the most flexibility.
With those caveats in mind, follow these steps to crop your picture in
Elements:
1. Grab the Crop tool, labeled in Figure 4-12.
2. On the options bar, set the Crop tool behavior by choosing an option
from the Aspect Ratio drop-down list, as shown in Figure 4-12.
Figure 4-12: You can use the options bar controls to establish the desired dimensions of your cropped image.
Swap
Crop tool

These options enable you to crop your photo to a specific size or to spe-
cific proportions, as follows:
• No Restriction: Choose this option if you don’t care whether your
cropped image has specific proportions. You then can crop the
image to any width or height you choose.
• Use Photo Ratio: Avoid this option. It crops your image in a way
that retains the original proportions of your photo; for example, if
your original was 3 units wide by 4 units tall, your cropped image
will also take on those proportions. The problem is that the pro-
gram then adds as many pixels as needed to take you back to the
picture’s original pixel count. Adding pixels, or resampling, nearly
always reduces picture quality. If you need to crop to a specific
proportion, use either of the next two options instead.
• Standard Frame Size (4 x 6, 5 x 7, and so on): If you want your
cropped photo to fit a spe-
cific frame size, select that
size from the menu. Leave
the Resolution box empty; if
you enter a value, the pro-
gram resamples the image.
• Custom Size: If you don’t see
the size you want on the
menu, select No Restriction
and then type the dimensions
into the neighboring Width
and Height boxes. Enter the
unit of measurement after
the values you type: For
example, type 5 inches or 10
picas in the box. Again, leave
the Resolution box empty.
I chose the 4 x 6 option for my
image.
3. Drag with the Crop tool to create
an initial crop boundary, as
shown in Figure 4-13.
After you complete your drag and
let up on the mouse button, the
area outside the crop boundary
appears dimmed, as shown in
Figure 4-13. You also see two but-
tons beneath the boundary: a green
check mark and a red cancel sign.

4. Adjust the crop boundary if needed.
You can resize and relocate the boundary as follows:
• Resize the boundary: Drag one of the square boxes that appear
around the perimeter of the boundary. (These boxes are known
as handles.) Elements restricts the boundary to maintain the 
proportions you set in Step 2.
• Move the boundary: Place your cursor inside the boundary and
drag it. Or, for precision moves, press the arrow keys on your key-
board: Press the up arrow to nudge the boundary up, the right
arrow to nudge the boundary to the right, and so on.
• Change the boundary orientation: Here’s a cool one: Want to see
how the picture would crop using a horizontal orientation instead
of a vertical, or vice versa? Click the Swap arrows between the
Width and Height boxes on the options bar. (See Figure 4-12.) Now,
instead of a crop boundary that’s, say, 4 inches wide by 6 inches
tall, you get a boundary that’s 6 inches wide by 4 inches tall.
Should you need to get rid of the boundary altogether and start over,
click the red cancel button, labeled in Figure 4-13.
5. Click the green Apply check mark underneath the crop boundary to
crop the image.
I labeled the check mark in Figure 4-13. (Exactly where the check mark
appears depends on the size of your photo.) My cropped portrait appears
on the right in Figure 4-11.
Adjusting Exposure
Achieving the right exposure is one of the trickiest aspects of photography,
which is why entire books have been written on the subject. The good news
is that because it is so easy to wind up with a photo that’s too dark or too light,
most photo-editing programs offer several tools for correcting exposure.
The next sections show you how to use the best of these tools to brighten an
underexposed photo, darken an overexposed image, and add impact by
adjusting contrast.
Which exposure tool is best?
Photoshop Elements, like many photo-editing programs, offers a number of
tools for correcting exposure. I address just two of these tools, the Levels
filter and the Shadows/Highlights filter, both found on the Enhance➪Adjust
Lighting menu. I picked these two filters because they offer the best combina-
tion of good results and ease of use.

Before I explain these filters, a little lingo lesson is needed to help you better
understand the filter options and exposure correction in general.
Photographers describe exposure in the following terms: 
 Highlights are the brightest areas in the image. The term blown highlights
refers to areas that should contain a range of light colors but are instead
completely white because of overexposure.
 Shadows are the darkest areas of a photo. Photographers often discuss
hidden shadow detail or blocked shadows when referring to photo details
that are severely underexposed and thus obscured.
 Midtones are areas of medium brightness.
 Contrast refers to the range of brightness values in an image, from shad-
ows to midtones to highlights. A high-contrast image consists mainly of
strong shadows and highlights, with few midtones. In a low-contrast
image, the range of brightness values is limited; for example, everything
is of medium brightness, with few shadows or highlights.
Now that you have the basic terminology sorted out, look at Table 4-1,
which suggests the appropriate filter for the exposure problem you’re
facing. Some pictures, by the way, may need an application of both Levels
and Shadows/Highlights. (Remember, if you use software other than
Elements, you likely can find similar tools in your program, but the names
may vary.) For specifics on how to use these filters, read the next two 
sections.
Also check out the DVD that accompanies this book. It contains a QuickTime
movie titled “Adjusting Exposure and Focus,” in which I demonstrate the
Levels and Shadows/Highlights filters.

Applying the Shadows/Highlights filter
At first glance, the photo in Figure 4-14 appears to be a throw-away. The left
side of the image is way too dark, whereas the clouds and buildings on the
right are overexposed.
Figure 4-14: Details are lost in too-dark shadows and too-bright highlights.
But not so fast: You may be surprised at just how much you can tweak this
kind of lopsided exposure. In Elements, for example, the Shadows/Highlights
filter does an amazing job of revealing details formerly lost in the shadows
and toning down too-bright highlights.
Before I show you how to use this filter, though, I want to point out that it
doesn’t affect any areas that are absolute black or absolute white. It works
only on shadows and highlights that are almost black or almost white. No cor-
rection filter, in fact, can create highlight or shadow detail out of fully white
or black pixels — the filter can’t simply make up those details out of thin air.
That said, I still think the Shadows/Highlights filter will quickly become one
of your favorites. Here’s how to use it:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights.
The Shadows/Highlights filter dialog box opens. 

2. Select the Preview check box, as shown in Figure 4-15, so that you can
see the results of the filter in your image.
Figure 4-15: The Shadows/Highlights filter automatically 
brightens shadows by 25%.
3. Brighten shadows by dragging the Shadows slider to the right.
When you first open the filter, Elements automatically lightens the dark-
est parts of your image by 25%. To brighten shadows more, drag the
slider farther to the right; to darken shadow areas, drag the slider to the
left. I set the slider to 71% for my image.
4. Darken highlights by dragging the Highlights slider to the right.
For my image, I uncovered a little additional highlight detail by setting
the slider to 17%. Notice, again, though, that the filter doesn’t alter
areas that are completely white — in my image, the brightest cloud
areas.
5. Adjust midtone contrast by dragging the Midtones slider.
Drag the slider to the right to increase contrast; drag left to decrease
contrast.
6. Click OK to close the filter dialog box and apply the changes to your
photo.
Figure 4-16 shows you my final filter settings along with my corrected image.
The picture still has some blown highlights and blocked shadows, but it’s
greatly improved from the original.

Chapter 4: Performing Photo First Aid

108
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Figure 4-16: I used the filter settings shown in Figure 4-15 to produce this improved version of
the image in Figure 4-14.
So what do you do about those highlight and shadow areas the filter can’t fix?
Well, you have two options. You can either use your paint brush to simply
paint in the correct colors, or you can clone (copy and paste) properly
exposed areas over the bad spots. Chapter 5 gives you an introduction to
painting; Chapter 6 explains cloning.
Adjusting exposure and contrast with Levels
Think of the Levels filter as the opposite of the Shadows/Highlights filter — sort
of. With Shadows/Highlights, you can brighten shadows and darken highlights.
In addition, you can increase or decrease contrast in the midtones. 
With Levels, you can deepen shadows and brighten highlights. When you do
so, you also increase overall image contrast. In addition, you can make mid-
tones either brighter or darker.
To recap, turn to the Levels filter if you want to
 Adjust the brightness of midtones.
 Add “pop” by increasing contrast.
 Darken the darkest areas of your picture.
 Lighten the lightest areas of your picture.

(Don’t worry; all this begins to become second nature after you get some
experience evaluating and repairing your photos.)
The image in Figure 4-17 offers a good example of an image that can be
improved by the Levels filter. Most of the picture is of medium brightness,
and there aren’t any deep, rich blacks or bright whites. In other words, it just
doesn’t have any “oomph,” if you want my professional term. On top of that,
the midtones are a little too dark overall.
Figure 4-17: This fall scene is underexposed in the midtones and also lacks contrast, with no
strong highlights or shadows.
To correct images that suffer from one or all of these issues, apply the Levels
filter like so:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels.
You see the Levels dialog box, shown in Figure 4-18. Don’t freak out —
I know it’s initially overwhelming, but you really need to worry only
about the area enclosed in the red box in the figure. Also turn on the
Preview check box so that you can preview the filter changes on your
image. (Any time you want to compare your “before” and “after” image
while the dialog box is open, just click the check box on and off.)

Figure 4-18: Drag the sliders to adjust the brightness of shadows, 
highlights, and midtones separately.
That graph in the middle of the dialog box is called a histogram. A his-
togram plots out the brightness values of all the pixels in your image,
with absolute black at the left end of the graph and absolute white at the
right end. The height of the graph at any one spot reflects how many
pixels you have at that brightness value.
For example, the histogram you see in Figure 4-18 shows that my original
park image has almost no pixels that are very light or white, and only a
smattering that are pure black. The big hill indicates that most of the
pixels are clustered toward the darker side of the midtones range.
2. To darken shadows, drag the Shadows slider, labeled in Figure 4-19,
to the right.
Elements takes all the pixels at the new position of the Shadows slider
and makes them black. Then it reassigns other pixels accordingly along
the brightness spectrum.
Notice that as you move the Shadows slider, the Midtones slider moves
in tandem. You can adjust the midtones values later if needed.
3. To brighten highlights, drag the Highlights slider to the left.
Histogram
Shadows
Midtones
Highlights

Now Elements finds all the pixels at the new position of the Highlights
slider and makes them white. Then it redistributes the other image
pixels along the brightness spectrum as needed. Again, the Midtones
slider moves in tandem when you drag the Highlights slider.
4. Drag the Midtones slider as needed to tweak midtone brightness.
Drag the slider to the right to darken midtones; drag it to the left to
lighten midtones.
5. Click OK to apply the filter and close the dialog box.
I dragged the sliders to the position you see in Figure 4-19 to achieve the
corrected image.
Adjusting exposure sometimes creates an apparent loss of color vibrancy. If
this happens, you can bump up color saturation with the Hue/Saturation
filter. See Chapter 6 for details.

of good.

Sharpening Focus
Those high-tech spy-thriller movies and TV shows are starting to annoy me.
For one thing, I don’t believe that in real life, a size two beauty wearing a
leather bustier and high-heeled boots kicks the stuffing out of the bad guys
on a weekly basis and that she emerges from these battles with lipstick and
mascara unsmudged.
More to the point of this chapter, I especially hate it when the techies in the
spy guy’s imaging lab take a totally out-of-focus photo and magically trans-
form it into a picture that’s so sharply focused that you can read the license
plate number on a car that was a block away from the photographer. I’m sorry
to disappoint you, but that kind of focus correction simply isn’t possible.
You can, however, take an image that’s slightly soft, like the left portrait in
Figure 4-20, and create the illusion of sharper focus, as I did for the right por-
trait. And just so you know, even removing the amount of blur you see in the
original portrait is pushing the limits of focus-sharpening.
Figure 4-20: Applying the Unsharp Mask filter to a slightly blurry photo (left) creates the
illusion of sharper focus (right). 

Why do I say illusion of sharper
focus? Because a sharpening filter
doesn’t really change the focus of
your picture. What it does is increase
contrast along the boundaries where
light areas meet darker areas. To do
that, the filter creates sharpening
halos along those boundaries, as
shown in the close-ups in Figure 4-21.
The light side of a color boundary
gets lighter, and the dark side
gets darker. From a distance, this
contrast shift tricks the eye into
thinking that the picture is more
sharply focused.
In Elements, the sharpening filter I
prefer is called the Unsharp Mask
filter. (The name stems from an old
darkroom technique that involves
using a blurry negative to create
sharpening halos, if you care.)
Follow these steps to apply it:
1. Set the output size and resolu-
tion of your image, following
the Chapter 3 instructions.
You should always take this
step first because changing the
size and resolution can affect
how much sharpening an image
needs.
2. Select the area you want to sharpen.
The section at the beginning of this chapter shows you how. If your
whole image needs help, as mine does, skip this step.
3. Choose Enhance➪Unsharp Mask (Elements 5.0 only).
If you use an earlier version of Elements, choose
Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask instead. The filter is the same; Adobe
just moved it to another menu in Version 5.0.

114
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Either way, you next see the
Unsharp Mask dialog box, which
is shown in Figure 4-22.
4. Adjust the dialog box preview if
needed.
Select the Preview check box so
that you can see the effects of
the sharpening filter both in the
image window and in the smaller
preview window inside the
dialog box.
To zoom the preview in the
dialog box, click the plus and
minus buttons underneath the
preview. To display another area
of the image in the preview,
place your cursor in the preview
and then drag when you see
the cursor change to a little
hand icon.
Try keeping your image window
preview zoomed out so that you
can see the entire image. Then zoom in on the most critical areas of your
image inside the dialog box preview. This way, you can monitor the
sharpening effect both at a distant and close-up view.
5. Adjust the sharpening effect by using the three dialog box sliders.
Each slider affects the sharpening effect in a different way:
• Amount controls the overall strength of the effect; the higher the
value, the more intense the sharpening halos become.
• Radius controls the width of the sharpening halos. Typically, I use a
value below 0.5 for on-screen images — pictures destined for the
Web or a multimedia presentation — and between 0.5 and 2.0 for
print images. Print images usually require more sharpening than
on-screen images, especially if you print on textured paper.
• Threshold controls whether the halos appear along every color
boundary in your image or just along boundaries where very-
bright pixels meet very dark pixels — in other words, high-contrast
areas. Digital imaging gurus refer to those high-contrast bound-
aries as edges. At a value of 0, all boundaries get the sharpening
halos; raise the value to limit the effect to just the image edges.
Figure 4-22: Click the plus and minus buttons
to zoom the dialog box preview.

I usually raise the Threshold value to anywhere from 1 to 5 when
retouching portraits. This setting helps to keep the sharpening
effect from making skin texture look rough.
6. Click OK to apply the filter and
close the dialog box.
For my sharpened image, I used
the following filter settings:
Amount, 150; Radius, 1.3;
Threshold, 1.0.
Be careful not to oversharpen your
images. If you do, your picture can
take on a sandpaper-like texture,
with visible sharpening halos along
image edges. Figure 4-23 shows an
example of an oversharpened pic-
ture. The larger you print your
photo, the more subtle you need to
be with sharpening, as halos and tex-
turing become more apparent at
large print sizes.
Watch the QuickTime movie titled
“Adjusting Exposure and Focus,”
found on the DVD accompanying this
book, for a look at the Unsharp Mask filter in action and for some additional
sharpening tips.
Blurring a Busy Background
A good photographer makes sure that the picture background doesn’t dis-
tract from the subject. But sometimes, posing a subject against a good back-
ground just isn’t possible. Try as I might, for example, I couldn’t convince the
giraffe you see in Figure 4-24 to move to a better spot for his portrait. And as
a result, the animal is almost lost amidst the tree branches and flowering
trees in the background.
When you face a similar situation, you can downplay a distracting back-
ground by throwing it into soft focus. You can do this in two ways: First, when
taking the picture, use camera settings that result in a short depth of field, or
range of sharp focus. Chapter 2 explains this technique.
115
Chapter 4: Performing Photo First Aid
Figure 4-23: Oversharpening leads to grainy
images and distracting sharpening halos.

116
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Figure 4-24: The trees in the background distract from the subject (left); blurring the
background in my photo editor improved the image (right).
If you need to blur the background even more, you can do so easily in just
about any photo editor. Here’s how to do it in Photoshop Elements:
1. Select the area that you want to blur.
The first section in this chapter shows you how. For my picture, I
selected everything but the giraffe.
Be very careful when creating your selection outline; otherwise, you may
wind up with a noticeable border of unblurred pixels around your subject.
2. Choose Filter➪Blur➪Blur More.
This filter has no user-controlled options — just choosing the command
applies a small amount of blur to the selected area. If you want more
blur, just keep choosing the command until you get the effect you want.
I applied the filter about ten times to produce the “after” image on the
right in Figure 4-24.
In Elements, you can quickly reapply the last filter you used by select-
ing it from the top of the Filter menu. Or just press Ctrl+F (Windows) or
Ô+F (Mac).

E
ver notice how many infomercials and TV-shopping shows feature
beauty products these days? Gone are the days of Ginsu knives and the
Popeil Pocket Fisherman. Now the screen is filled with celebrities hawking
products that promise to erase all blemishes, turn teeth blindingly white, and
generally morph ordinary humans into the perfect specimens shown on the
pages of the fashion magazines. 
I’ve never bought any of these miracle gels and goos, so I
can’t say that none of them live up to their claims. But I
can tell you with some assurance that the flawless
models/movie stars/heiresses you see on magazine
covers owe their perfect appearance not to the latest
beauty product, but to the skills of a talented photo
retoucher who has carefully eradicated every zit,
wrinkle, and age spot. 
Well, I see no reason why everyone else shouldn’t
benefit from the same helping hand, so this chapter
shows you how to remove all sorts of portrait flaws,
including red-eye. In addition, the first section of this
chapter introduces you to layers, a feature that’s essential
to getting good retouching results.
For a “live look” at techniques presented in this chapter, grab the
DVD that accompanies this book and watch the QuickTime movies titled
“Retouching Eyes and Teeth,” “Repairing Skin,” and “Introduction to Layers.”

Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Discovering Layers: Don’t Retouch without Them!
As you explore this chapter, you may notice that many projects involve a fea-
ture known as layers. The next several sections introduce you to this impor-
tant photo-retouching tool. Layers aren’t just a Photoshop Elements feature,
by the way. If you don’t use Elements, check your software’s Help system to
find out whether the program offers layers and, if so, how you access them.
Generally, programs that offer layers offer similar layer features to those
found in Elements.
What are layers, anyway?
Image layers have no real-life equivalent, but you can start by thinking of
them as the sheets of clear plastic, similar to the transparencies used with
overhead projectors, if you’re old enough to remember that presentation
technology. Your virtual transparencies, however, hold image pixels, those
squares of color that make up a digital photo.
All images in Elements begin life with one layer, which is called the
Background layer and holds all your original image pixels. The Background
layer is fully opaque throughout.
On top of the Background layer, you can stack new layers, which I refer to as
editing layers. Pixels on an editing layer can be opaque, transparent, or some-
where in between (translucent, in technical terms). Wherever an editing layer
is transparent, you see the pixels on the underlying layer. In areas where a
layer is translucent, the underlying pixels are partially visible.
For an example of how layers work, take a look at my original, unretouched
photo in Figure 5-1. Next to the photo, you see the Layers palette, which is
command central for layers in Elements. The palette displays thumbnail
views of all the layers in your photo and also contains controls that offer the
quickest ways to accomplish most layer tasks. To open the palette, choose
Window➪Layers.
When retouching my photo, I added four layers atop my Background layer:
 First, I added a layer on which I used the Clone tool, described in
Chapter 6, to remove the chocolate stain near the neckline of the shirt.
 Next, I created another new layer on which I cloned away the necklace,
which I thought was a little distracting.
 To quiet my inner perfectionist’s voice, I added another layer on which I
painted the phone with a new color that didn’t clash as much with the
subject’s lips.
 On the top layer, I created a digital frame using the technique outlined in
Chapter 8.

Figure 5-1: Every image starts life with one layer, called the Background layer.
Figure 5-2 shows you the final, retouched image. To the right of the photo, the
Layers palette shows the order of the retouching layers.
In the Elements Layers palette, transparent areas of a layer are represented
by the gray-and-white checkerboard pattern you see in Figure 5-2.
Of course, I could have done all this work directly on the Background layer.
But keeping each change on a separate layer makes life easier. The next two
sections spell out the main benefits of retouching with layers.
One quick side note: In this book, I show the Layers palette as an individual
window. By default, it is instead part of the Palette Bin. If you want to take
your Layers palette out of the Palette Bin — which frees up additional screen
space for working on your photo — see the QuickTime movie “Getting
Started with Photoshop Elements,” on the DVD that accompanies this book.
You can also find a QuickTime movie that provides an on-screen introduction
of basic layer concepts.

Use layers for safer, easier retouching
If you make your changes on an editing layer and then mess up or later
change your mind about what you’ve done, you can simply remove the 
editing layer. This makes experimenting both easier and safer. For example,
when I finished my picture, I decided that I liked the necklace after all. So I
just trashed the layer that held the pixels I used to cover it up, as shown in
Figure 5-3. If I worked solely on the Background layer, I could get the necklace
back only by choosing Edit➪Undo, and I first would have to undo all the
changes I made after I removed the necklace.

Figure 5-3: To restore the necklace, I just removed the layer that contained the patch I made to cover it up.
Alternatively, you can make the offending editing-layer pixels transparent —
invisible, if you prefer — by dragging over them with the Eraser tool. For exam-
ple, when painting the phone, I spilled paint onto the surrounding area. So I
just dragged over the spilled paint with the Eraser, as shown in Figure 5-4. You
also can make layer pixels transparent by selecting them and deleting them.
You can’t, however, erase or delete pixels on the Background layer. The
Background layer can contain only opaque pixels, so any pixels that you try
to erase or delete instead take on the background paint color. In Figure 5-5,
the background paint color was set to white, so my attempt to erase the
spilled paint just resulted in replacing the colored pixels with white ones.
Here’s one more way that layers give you an editing safety net: Most tools
and filters affect only the currently selected layer, so you can’t accidentally
alter an element on another layer. (You select a layer by clicking it in the
Layers palette.)

Gain more creative control with layers
By using the Opacity and Blending mode controls in the Layers palette, you
gain a great deal of control over how the pixels on your editing layers blend
with the pixels on layers below, as follows:
 Layer opacity: This setting controls whether your layer pixels com-
pletely obscure the pixels below. At 100 percent opacity, the editing
pixels completely cover pixels on the layer below. At a lower opacity,
your original image pixels remain partially visible. For example, I often
paint at a lowered opacity when covering up blown highlights, a topic
explored near the end of this chapter. That way, instead of completely
eliminating the highlights, which would reduce contrast, I can simply
tone them down.
 Layer blending mode: This setting enables you to mix editing pixels and
original pixels in special ways. Some blending modes create special
effects, but others are useful in the retouching room. For example, when
painting the phone in my image, I set the blending mode for the paint
layer to Color. This mode retains the natural shadows and highlights of
the original pixels but uses the color data from the editing layer, produc-
ing a natural result.
Some tools, such as the Brush tool, also offer opacity and blending mode con-
trols, so you could accomplish the same results by working directly on the
Background layer. But again, doing so makes changing your mind difficult —
you have to undo all your work and start again. With editing layers, you can
change the blending mode or opacity any time the mood strikes. 
In addition, you can use the Move tool to relocate, rotate, and otherwise
manipulate anything on an editing layer. This benefit is especially helpful
when building collages or otherwise combining photos. You can experiment
freely until you arrive at a composition you like. If you instead paste all the
elements onto your Background layer, you lose that flexibility because
moving an object on the Background layer produces the same result as using
the Eraser tool — you get a hole that’s filled with the background paint color.
For more on collage building, see Chapter 7.
Layer control 101
You can explore a variety of layer techniques throughout this book. But so
that you have a one-stop reference as well, the following list explains how to
accomplish the most common layer tasks in Photoshop Elements:
 Display and hide the Layers palette: Choose Window➪Layers.
 Add a new, empty layer: In the Layers palette, click the layer that’s
directly below where you want to put the new layer. (You can skip this
step if your image contains only the Background layer.) Then click the
New Layer icon in the Layers palette, labeled in Figure 5-6.
123
Chapter 5: Retouching Portraits

124
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Elements automatically assigns your
new layers the names Layer 1,
Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on. If you
want to rename a layer to remind
you what it holds, double-click the
layer name, type the new name, and
press Enter.
 Copy part of an image onto a new
layer: Select the area you want to
copy and then choose Layer➪
New➪Layer via Copy. (Chapter 4
introduces the selection process.)
Use this command only for copying
selections within the same image.
If you copy and paste an object from
another photo into the image,
Elements automatically places the
pasted object onto a new layer.
 Duplicate an entire layer: In the
Layers palette, drag the layer name
to the New Layer icon.
 Hide/display a layer: Click the little
eyeball icon to the left of the layer
thumbnail to hide the layer. Click in
the now-empty eyeball column to redisplay the eyeball and the layer
contents.
 Select a layer: Just click the layer name in the palette.
 Select a portion of a layer: If you want to select only some pixels on the
layer, click the layer name and then create your selection outline.
You can quickly select all the nontransparent areas of a layer — in other
words, the parts of the layer that contain visible pixels — by Ctrl-clicking
(Windows) or Ô-clicking (Mac) the layer thumbnail. 
 Delete a layer: Click the layer name in the palette and then click the Trash
icon, also labeled in the figure. Or just drag the layer to the Trash icon.
 Erase part of a layer: To erase a large area — or, to be technically accu-
rate, to make the layer pixels transparent — select the area and then
press Delete.
For smaller areas, select the Eraser tool, labeled in Figure 5-7. Choose
Brush from the Mode menu, adjust the brush size and shape as needed,
and then drag over the area you want to erase. If you set the Opacity
control on the options bar to 100%, the tool completely erases the pixels
it touches, as illustrated in Figure 5-4, in the preceding section. At a
lower opacity, the Eraser makes pixels translucent.

Figure 5-7: To fully erase pixels on an editing layer, set the Eraser tool’s 
Opacity value to 100 percent.
Don’t try to erase or delete pixels on the Background layer. If you do, the
pixels don’t become transparent; instead, they take on the background
paint color.
 Adjust layer opacity: Drag the Opacity slider located near the top of the
Layers palette.
 Adjust layer blending mode: Select the mode from the Blending Mode
drop-down list, labeled in Figure 5-6.
 Shuffle the order of editing layers: You can change the stacking order of
your editing layers — that is, the order in which they appear in the layer
list — by simply dragging a layer up or down in the palette. You cannot
move the Background layer, however.
 Combine layers: To fuse one layer with the layer directly beneath it, click
the uppermost layer of the two in the layers palette. Then choose Layer➪
Merge Down. To combine all layers in the image, choose Layer➪Flatten. 
Why merge layers? Because every layer adds to the image file size,
which puts more strain on your computer. So whenever possible, you
should merge layers. Just remember, after you do so, you can no longer
manipulate the layer pixels independently.

 Preserve layers when saving your image: In Elements, you must save
your photo in either the PSD (Photoshop) or TIFF file format and you
must select the Layers check box in the Save As dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-8. Otherwise, all your layers are merged when you save the photo.

format and select the Layers check box.
Removing Red-Eye
Even if you take advantage of your camera’s red-eye reduction flash mode,
some of your portrait subjects will wind up with red-eye. Fortunately, this
phenomenon, which lends a gleaming red tint to the eyes, is usually easy to
remove.
The next section explains how to use the type of automated red-eye removal
tool found in many photo-editing programs. For eyes that don’t respond to an
automated tool, the second section offers an alternative technique.

I demonstrate both processes in the QuickTime movie titled “Repairing Eyes
and Teeth,” included on the DVD that accompanies this book.
Using automated red-eye removal
Most photo editors offer a red-eye removal tool, and the one in Photoshop
Elements is particularly adept. I was able to repair the red-eye problem you
see in the left image in Figure 5-9 in just a few seconds, in fact.
Figure 5-9: Using a flash often causes red-eye (left); you can fix the problem easily in your photo editor (right).
You apply the tool as follows:
1. Using the Zoom tool, magnify the image so that you get a close-up
view of the first eye you want to repair.
The Zoom tool is labeled in Figure 5-10. Just drag around the eye area to
fill the screen with that portion of the image.
2. Select the Red-Eye Removal tool, also labeled in Figure 5-10.
When you select the tool, the options bar offers two controls — Pupil
Size and Darken Amount — plus an Auto button.
127
Chapter 5: Retouching Portraits

128
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Figure 5-10: Drag around the eye with the Red-Eye Removal tool.
3. Set the Pupil Size and Darken Amount options both to 50%.
These are the default settings, so this step may be unnecessary.
4. Click the Auto button on the options bar.
When you click the button, Elements tries to locate and repair the
offending red-eye pixels. But you need to be careful, because the tool
sometimes replaces red pixels that aren’t actually in the eyes.
If you get good results, great — you’re done! If not, choose Edit➪Undo
and move on to Step 5.
5. Drag with the Red-Eye Removal tool to enclose the eye plus some sur-
rounding area in a selection outline, as illustrated in Figure 5-10.
After you release the mouse button, Elements again attempts to replace
the red-eye pixels with properly colored pixels. In the case of my exam-
ple image, the tool worked well; the results appear in the right photo in
Figure 5-9.
Usually, if the Elements Red-Eye Removal tool is going to work, it does so on
your first or second try. But if you still don’t get results, you can undo your
initial attempts by choosing Edit➪Undo and then adjusting the tool’s perfor-
mance as follows: 
Red-Eye Removal tool
Zoom tool

 Affect a larger or smaller area. To alter a larger area of eye pixels, raise
the Pupil Size value and drag around the eye again. Or, to affect a smaller
range of pixels, lower the value.
 Make the replacement pixels darker or lighter. Raise the Darken
Amount value if you want the replacement pixels to be darker. Lower the
value if the replacement pixels are too dark.
You must adjust the tool settings before dragging; neither the Pupil Size
nor Darken Amount option have any effect after the fact.
 Click instead of drag in Step 5. Instead of dragging around the entire
eye, try simply clicking on one of the red-eye pixels. Sometimes, this
technique produces better results than dragging.
Still no luck? Don’t waste any more time on the automated tool. Instead, use
the eye-repair technique outlined in the next section.
Painting out red-eye (and glowing animal eyes)
Not all red-eye removers are as adept as the one in Elements. And if the red
pixels are very bright, even the Elements version of the tool may not fully
eliminate the problem.
In addition, no red-eye removal tool works on animal eyes. Red-eye tools know
how to replace only red pixels, and animal eyes usually take on a yellow, white,
or green glow in response to a flash, as shown in the left photo in Figure 5-11.
Figure 5-11: Red-eye removal tools can’t fix most animal eyes, but you can simply paint in 
the correct eye colors.

You can approach the problem in
a number of ways, but the easiest
solution is simply to paint in the new
eye colors, as outlined in the following
steps. (It’s not as hard as the length of
the steps makes it appear — I just need
to spell out some brush settings in
detail.) 
1. Open the Layers palette by choos-
ing Window➪Layers.
2. Create a new empty layer by click-
ing the New Layer icon, labeled in
Figure 5-12.
3. Press D to set the foreground paint
color to black.
Or click the Default Colors
swatch, labeled together with
the foreground paint color swatch
in Figure 5-13.

4. Select the Brush tool, labeled in Figure 5-13.
If the Brush tool isn’t visible, click and hold on the little black triangle in
the lower-right corner of the visible tool’s icon to display a menu of
related tools. Then click the Brush tool’s icon to choose it.
5. Select a round brush from the Brushes palette.
To open the palette, just click where indicated in Figure 5-14. Then click
any of the first several brushes. Any brush size will do for now; just be
sure to select a round brush.
If your cursor looks like a little paint brush icon, visit the program’s
Preferences dialog box to change it to a cursor that reflects the actual
brush size and shape. See Chapter 4 for details.
6. Open the More Options palette and set the Hardness value to 0, as
shown in Figure 5-14.
A low Hardness value causes your paint to fade out at the edges of your
brush stroke.
7. Using the Size control on the options bar, set the brush size to about
one tenth the size of the area you need to paint.
Figure 5-14: Select a round brush and set the Hardness value to 0.

8. Set the other tool options as shown in Figure 5-14.
Set the Mode to Normal; Opacity to 100 percent; Airbrush, off (the icon
should appear as in the figure); and all Tablet Options, off.
9. Using small, swirling strokes, paint over the damaged eye area, as
shown in Figure 5-15.
Try to avoid painting the same pixels repeatedly. That way, the fuzziness
of your brush creates some tonal variations, as shown in Figure 5-15,
because the paint fades at the edges of the cursor. Keep painting until all
the problem pixels are replaced. (If the problem pixels are very satu-
rated and using the feather-painting technique doesn’t fully cover them,
just go ahead and keep swabbing them until the color is hidden. You can
paint some tonal variations back in later if needed.)
Figure 5-15: Use small, circular strokes to cover the bad pixels.
10. Create another new layer.
Your next task is to recreate the natural white highlights that appear in
the eye — assuming that you covered them in Step 9. (If not, move on to
Step 14.) Your second new layer will hold the paint you use to create the
highlights. 
11. Press X to swap the foreground and background paint colors, so that
white is the foreground color. 
Or click the Swap Colors icon in the toolbox, labeled in Figure 5-16.
12. Reduce the brush size if needed to match the size of the highlight you
want to create.

Figure 5-16: Add a few dots of white to recreate the specular highlights in the eye.
13. Click in each eye to add the highlights.
For this step, I like to zoom out so that I can see both eyes and the face,
as shown in Figure 5-16; the wider view gives me a better idea of the
right size and placement of the highlights.
If the highlights appear too bright, lower the Opacity value for the highlight-
paint layer in the Layers palette. For my dog image, an Opacity value of
68 percent created a better result than full-on white. (Of course, you can
always just repaint the highlights using a light gray instead of white.)
14. View the eyes at the size you plan to print or display the finished
image.
At this point, you may want to use the Brush tool to create some addi-
tional tones or colors to the eye. If you do so, create a third new layer
to hold your new paint. But don’t sweat this step too much — unless
you’re going to print or display the image at a very large size, no one is
likely to be able to notice the difference.
15. When you’re happy with the eyes, choose Layers➪Flatten Image to
merge the paint layer with the original image.
You can see my repaired dog eyes on the right side of Figure 5-11.

Whitening Teeth
Every time I teach por-
trait retouching, I have to
fight the urge to “forget”
to bring up the subject
of teeth whitening.
Personally, I think the
whole obsession with
bleaching our choppers
is a little bizarre — I
mean, the expression is
pearly whites, not glow-
in-the-dark whites, yes?
But of course, I, too, have
succumbed to the pres-
sure and even have
touched up my own teeth
in pictures now and
again. So it would be
unfair not to share the
secret with you, I guess.
Just promise that you’ll
go for a subtle effect like
what you see in the lower image in Figure 5-17. As a rule, if the first thing you
notice when you look at a portrait is teeth, you’ve gone too far.
Alright, I’ll step down off my bleach box now and explain how the process
works:
1. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers palette.
2. Create a rough selection outline around the teeth.
The Selection Brush works great for this task. Chapter 4 offers specifics
if you need help, but don’t worry about getting the selection outline per-
fect. Just make sure to include all the teeth in the outline.
3. Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy to copy the selected teeth area to
a new layer.
4. Zoom in for a close view of the teeth.
Just drag around the mouth area with the Zoom tool (refer to Figure 5-10
to see the tool).
5. Select the Dodge tool, labeled in Figure 5-18.
The Dodge tool, which both lightens and desaturates colors, shares a
toolbox slot with the Burn and Sponge tools. 
Figure 5-17: When whitening teeth, aim for a subtle effect!

Figure 5-18: The secret to whitening teeth is the Dodge tool.
6. Select a soft, round brush from the Brushes palette.
See the preceding section if you need help using the Brushes palette.
7. Adjust the Size value until the brush cursor is slightly smaller than the
smallest tooth.
8. Set the Range value to Midtones and the Exposure value to 30%.
With the Dodge tool, you can lighten shadows, midtones, and highlights
independently. For tooth whitening, start with the midtones.
The Exposure value affects how much change you get with a single swipe
of the tool. The results you get from the default value, 50%, usually are
too intense, so lower the value to at least 30%.
9. Drag over the surface of each tooth once or twice.
Each time you pass over the same area, the pixels get progressively
whiter and brighter. Remember that teeth toward the back of the mouth
would naturally be darker than those in front.
Dodge tool
135
Chapter 5: Retouching Portraits

136
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
To remove dark stains between teeth, change the Range value to Shadows,
reduce the brush size, and drag once or twice over the stained areas.
Don’t select Highlights as the Range value. Dodging the highlights in
teeth nearly always produces unrealistic results.
To watch me perform this dental magic on-screen, see the QuickTime
movie titled “Retouching Eyes and Teeth,” included on the DVD that
ships with this book. That same movie also demonstrates the technique
covered in the next section, which features the Dodge tool’s cousin, the
Burn tool.
10. When you’re happy with the teeth, choose Layer➪Flatten to merge the
whitening layer with the Background layer.
Emphasizing Eyes
In the preceding section, I show you how to use the Dodge tool to whiten
teeth. The Dodge tool’s opposite, the Burn tool, also comes in handy in por-
trait retouching. This tool both darkens and desaturates colors and, when
applied with a light touch, can give the eyes additional impact. You can see
the difference the tool can make in Figure 5-19. The left image shows the unre-
touched portrait; the right image, the results of applying the Burn tool.
Figure 5-19: You can draw attention to the eyes and make a subject appear more sharply
focused by applying the Burn tool to the lashes and pupils.

Notice that in my before and after portraits, the change I made is very subtle,
yet it not only draws more attention to the eyes but also makes the whole
image appear more sharply focused. Making the dark areas of the eye darker
increases contrast, and adding contrast creates the illusion of sharper focus —
a fact you can explore in the focus-correction section of Chapter 4. So if your
portrait suffers from soft focus, try the following burning technique before you
apply a sharpening filter. That way, you can avoid adding unwanted texture to
the skin, which is often a side effect of sharpening filters.
Here’s how to perform this trick:
1. Copy the eye area to a new layer.
Just create a rough selection outline around the eyes by using the
Selection Brush or any other selection tool you prefer. Then choose
Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
2. Select the Burn tool, labeled in Figure 5-20.
The tool shares a toolbox slot with the Dodge tool, covered in the pre-
ceding section.
Figure 5-20: The Burn tool darkens and desaturates the pixels it touches.

Chapter 5: Retouching Portraits

138
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
3. Select a small, soft brush from the Brushes palette on the options bar.
4. Set the Range value to Shadows and the Exposure value to 15%.
The Exposure value determines how much change the tool produces
each time you click or drag. It’s best to use a low value and then apply
the tool multiple times if necessary; at the default value, 50%, you can
easily produce garish results with just one stroke.
5. Drag over the pupils and along the lash line.
Be careful about burning the iris of the eye — the Burn tool also desatu-
rates colors, so you run the risk of making a blue-eyed somebody a 
gray-eyed somebody. And if you’re retouching a male portrait, don’t go
overboard with the lashes, either, unless you want that male to be a little
annoyed with you.
6. Also apply the tool to darken the eyebrows if desired.
For this step, you may need to switch the Range value to Highlights or
Midtones, depending on the color of the subject’s brows. Experiment to
find the best setting.
7. Choose Layer➪Flatten to merge the burned layer with the original.
The Burn and Dodge tools are named after traditional darkroom tools that
are used to selectively lighten and darken areas of a photograph. If you’ve
never worked in a darkroom and have trouble remembering which tool does
what, just remember that when toast burns, it gets darker.
Repairing Skin
Retouching skin is one of the most difficult tasks you can tackle in the digital
darkroom. You can easily destroy the skin’s natural texture and color varia-
tions in the process of covering up blemishes, boo-boos, and other flaws.
So take your time and don’t be surprised if you need to try several different
tools or approaches to find one that works. 
The next two sections explain how to remove small blemishes and cover up
shiny spots on the skin. For larger repairs, you may need to use the alterna-
tive retouching techniques explored in Chapter 6. In particular, you should
investigate cloning, a process that comes in handy for some skin repairs as
well as for the photo-restoration projects covered in Chapter 6.
In addition, see the QuickTime movie “Repairing Skin,” on the DVD that ships
with this book, for a demonstration of the techniques in this section as well
as information on how to give skin a sun-kissed glow.

Healing blemishes
For tiny blemishes like the one you
see in the top image in Figure 5-21,
you can simply copy and paste a bit
of surrounding skin over the flaw.
Chapter 7 explains the copy/paste
routine in detail, but in brief, you
simply select the pixels you want to
use as a patch, choose Edit➪Copy,
and then choose Edit➪Paste. Then
you just use the Move tool to drag
the patch over the flaw.
If you use Photoshop Elements (or
Photoshop), however, you have an
easier and faster option: You can
cover up the flaw using the Spot
Healing brush. This tool hides flaws
by automatically replacing the pixels
under your cursor with pixels that
blend with the surrounding area.
I used the tool to repair the skin in
Figure 5-21.
You apply the Spot Healing Brush
like so:
1. Select the Spot Healing Brush, labeled in Figure 5-22.
The Spot Healing Brush shares a toolbox slot with the Healing Brush, so
be sure to select the correct tool. The options bar should show the con-
trols you see in Figure 5-22 when the Spot Healing Brush is active.
2. Select any soft brush from the Brushes palette, as shown in Figure 5-22.
A soft brush helps the repaired pixels blend in better with the surround-
ing area. Remember that the fuzzy brush icons in the palette represent a
soft brush.
3. Set the Type control on the options bar to Proximity Match.
4. Select the Sample All Layers box on the options bar.
5. Open the Layers palette and create a new layer to hold your repair.
With the Sample All Layers option turned on, the Spot Healing Brush can
see through layers. So you don’t need to copy the blemish to a new
layer, as you do with most of the other projects in this chapter. Just
create a new, empty layer by clicking the New Layer icon in the Layers
palette (see Figure 5-23).

6. Using the Size control, adjust the brush size until your cursor is
slightly larger than the blemish.
The tool works best when you include a little margin of “good” skin
around the edges of the cursor, as shown in Figure 5-23.
7. Click to heal the spot.
After you click, Elements attempts to replace the blemish pixels with
good skin pixels. If the entire blemish isn’t repaired on your first click,
either click again or drag over the remaining area that needs help.
8. When you finish your repairs, merge the repair layer with the
Background layer by choosing Layer➪Flatten Image.
This tool can work magic when the blemish is surrounded by a perimeter of
pixels that are pretty similar in color. But if the blemish is bordered by a vari-
ety of different shades, you’re not likely to get good results because Elements
doesn’t know exactly what color to make the repair pixels.
If you can’t get a natural repair after one or two tries, undo your work
(choose Edit➪Undo) and then rely on the Clone tool, covered in Chapter 6, to
do the job.
The Spot Healing Brush isn’t just for skin retouching. You can also use it to
remove almost any tiny flaw, from stray bits of lint on clothing to dust specks
on scanned photos.
Painting over shiny spots
When you shoot portraits with a flash or in very bright sunlight, light reflect-
ing off the skin can cause overexposed areas — blown highlights, in technical
terms, or just shiny spots, if you prefer plain talk. You can see an example in
the forehead area of Figure 5-24.
If the spots are small enough, you can cover them using the Spot Healing
Brush, described in the preceding section. The Clone tool, discussed in
Chapter 6, is another possibility; that tool simplifies the job of patching an
area using pixels from another part of your photo. Of course, cloning requires
that you have some good, matte skin areas to use as a patch.
In my experience, however, the easiest fix is simply to paint over the shiny
spots. But you have to use a special technique for the repair to look natural.
I used this approach to produce the retouched portrait you see in Figure 5-25.

Here’s the drill:

Choose Window➪Layers to open the palette, and click the New Layer
icon to create your empty layer. (Refer to Figure 5-23, in the preceding
section.)
2. Select the Eyedropper tool, labeled in Figure 5-26.
Set the tool mode to Point Sample, as shown in the figure.
3. Click on a “good” skin pixel in the area surrounding the shiny spot, as
shown in Figure 5-26.
Your click establishes the color you click as the foreground paint color —
the color you apply with the Brush tool.

edly over the same area until you get a good color match.
Don’t try to completely lose the shiny spot — your goal is just to tone it
down. Otherwise, you eradicate the natural mix of shadows, midtones,
and highlights that should be present.
Also, don’t worry that your new skin looks flat at this point. The next
step takes care of that problem, so just work on getting the skin tones
correct for now.
If you spill paint where you don’t want it to go, remember that you can
use the Eraser tool, introduced at the beginning of this chapter, to wipe
away the mess.
8. When you finish painting, choose Filter➪Texture➪Grain.
This special effects filter adds back the texture that you eliminated by
painting over the skin. When you choose the command, you see the
Filter Gallery dialog box, shown in Figure 5-28.
The preview on the left side of the dialog box shows you only the 
contents of your paint layer, as shown in the figure. (Remember, in
Elements, the checkerboard pattern indicates empty areas of the layer.)
You can use the controls at the bottom of the preview to zoom the dis-
play if needed; drag inside the preview to scroll the display.

9. Select Enlarged from the Grain Type drop-down list.
You can experiment with other options, but this one typically produces
the best results for me.
10. On the right side of the dialog box, set the Intensity and Contrast slid-
ers to 10.
The sliders control the look of the grain texture; the higher the values,
the more dramatic the result. Because you can’t see the textured pixels
atop the underlying image in the preview, it’s best to start with low
values at first.
11. Click OK to close the dialog box and then evaluate the results.
If the grain effect is too strong, choose Edit➪Undo. Then reapply the
filter, this time using even lower Intensity and Contrast settings. 
If the effect isn’t strong enough, just keep reapplying the filter until you
build up the texture you want.
12. Merge the paint layer with the Background layer by choosing Layer➪

You can use this same technique to cover up any blown highlights, by the
way. And don’t worry if the texture produced by the Grain filter isn’t a 100-
percent match for the surrounding area — unless you’re printing the photo
very large, the discrepancy shouldn’t be noticeable.
Tackling Other Portrait Problems
In addition to the techniques I cover in this chapter, some tools covered 
elsewhere in the book come in handy for certain portrait-retouching tasks.
So here’s a handy quick-reference guide to help you find the right tools to
solve other common portrait problems: 
 Diminishing a distracting background: Use the technique explained in
Chapter 4 to blur the background so that it takes less attention away
from your subject.
 Enhancing or adjusting skin tones: Try the color correction techniques
explored in Chapter 6.
Also take a gander at the QuickTime movie titled “Repairing Skin,” on this
book’s bonus DVD, for a look at another option for refining skin tones.
 Removing clothing stains, tattoos, and other large flaws: Head to
Chapter 6 for these problems, too. See the section related to the Clone
tool, with which you can hide almost any unwanted object in a photo. 
 Adjusting exposure and focus: Chapter 4 covers these topics. Don’t
forget, though, that using the eye enhancement technique discussed in
this chapter can make a slightly soft portrait appear in sharper focus.
 Opening closed eyes: Oh, boy, do I wish I had a good, automatic solu-
tion for this one. Unfortunately, the only answer is to find a picture in
which the subject’s eyes are open and then copy and paste those eyes
onto the closed eyes. See the section on collage building in Chapter 7 to
find out how to copy and paste the eyes and also how to position and
size the pasted eyes.

H
ere’s a tip you can use the next time conversation lags at a family gath-
ering: Just dig out the old photo albums. Before long, everyone will be
sharing stories about the people and places in those pictures. “Remember how
wonderful that rose garden smelled?” “That was the day that we found out we
were pregnant with you!” And, of course, “Hey, nice mullet, dork!”
When you finish mocking each other’s style gaffes and
speculating about whatever happened to the crazy
cousin who convinced you to get that mullet, don’t just
put those family photos away. Instead, work through
the projects in this chapter, which show you how to
get your photos into digital form and then use your
photo editor’s tools to solve the problems that are
likely to plague old photos.
Among other things, this chapter shows you how to
restore faded photos, correct colors, and remove
dust, stains, and other flaws. (For tips on sharpening
focus and adjusting exposure, see Chapter 4.) I also
explain what steps to take to create the best possible digital
originals of your film slides, prints, and negatives.
While you’re at it, go ahead and digitize important images that are still in
good shape, too. Those pictures will deteriorate sooner or later, so scanning
them now saves you the trouble of having to restore them later.

Scanning Your Photos
How well you can restore an old photo depends largely on the quality of the
original. You can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear, as they say. But you
can produce the best possible purse by following the guidelines in the next
two sections, which explain how to create high-quality scans of your original
photos.
Go pro or scan it yourself?
For the most painfree way to a good scan, I recommend taking your pictures
to a photo lab for scanning. The lab will scan your photos and put the result-
ing digital image files on a CD or DVD.
Professional scanning offers a couple of advantages:
 Time savings: Do-it-yourself scanning can be a time-consuming process,
with each scan taking several minutes — not a big deal if you’re scan-
ning only one or two photos, but a huge chore if you’re digitizing a
whole shoebox full of memories.
 Better scanning equipment: The equipment at professional labs typi-
cally is of higher quality than what you and I can buy for home or office
use, so the scans tend to be better. (This presumes that the person run-
ning the equipment is a qualified technician, which you’re more likely to
find at a pro imaging lab than at your local drugstore’s photo counter.)
Of course, the downside is cost. Depending on the type of scan you need, you
can pay anywhere from $1 to $8 a photo. When you’re placing your order, talk
with the lab technician about the ultimate print size, image file format, and
scan quality you want to ensure that you get the type of scan that works for
your intended use.
If you already own a scanner, you may want to order a few test scans from the
lab to determine whether the time and quality difference you gain from pro-
fessional scanning is worth the price. The next section offers tips to help you
get the best results for those times when you do tackle the job yourself.
Getting a good scan
The quality of consumer-level scanners varies widely, so if you’re in the
market for a new model, search out reviews before you buy. Photography
magazines and Web sites offer the best evaluations of a scanner’s abilities;
computer and electronics magazines sometimes worry more about scan
speed and other business-related functions than image quality. 

Whatever scanner you buy, follow the guidelines laid out in the next few sec-
tions to generate the best possible digital originals from your prints, slides,
and negatives.
In addition, dig out your scanner manual and give it a read. No two scanners
work the same way, so only your manual can provide specifics on critical
topics such as orienting your originals and setting up your system for the
fastest, best scans.
Cleaning your originals
Before scanning, make sure that your print, slide, or negative is as free of
dust and other dirt as possible. Use a soft, dry cloth or brush to gently clean
the original. Even better, visit your local camera store, where you can find
cloths, cleaning sprays, and other supplies specially made for this purpose. If
you’re using a flatbed scanner, make sure that the scanner bed is clean, too.
Don’t try to clean your prints, slides, or negatives with water, window
cleaner, or anything else not specifically designed for working with photo-
graphic media. Also, wear a pair of white, cotton gloves to avoid getting fin-
gerprints and skin oils on your originals.
Calculating the scan resolution
This option, which you set via your scanner software, determines how many
pixels your original scan contains. Chapter 2 explains resolution, but in short,
a good print requires at least 200 pixels per inch (ppi). However, 200 is a mini-
mum, and because most scanners can deliver more pixels, I suggest that you
aim higher and use 300 ppi as your scan resolution.
Scanner software varies in terms of how you specify resolution. Most scanners
enable you to select a print size plus an output resolution, but some offer only
a resolution setting. In the latter case, you need to do some math if your origi-
nal photo size is different than your intended print size. For example, to scan a
4 x 6-inch print and print it at double that size, set the scan resolution at 600 ppi,
not 300 ppi. (If you’re scanning a very tiny original and have a very large print
size in mind, you may have to compromise on resolution.)
One more note about resolution: Every scanner has a stated optical resolu-
tion, which is its true resolution capability. Most scanners enable you to go
beyond that optical resolution, however. When you do so, the software 
interpolates — makes up — additional pixels after scanning and adds them to
the scan file. This process is the same thing as resampling, which is the term
more commonly used when discussing changing the pixel count in your
photo software. Whatever you call it, adding pixels after an image is scanned
or captured by a digital camera diminishes picture quality.

Choosing the bit depth setting
Most scanners offer a choice of bit
depth settings. Here’s the scoop on
this setting, also controlled via your
scanner software:
 More bits means more colors. A
bit is a unit of computer data; bit
depth refers to how many units
are available for storing color
information in an image file. The
more bits, the more colors your
scan can contain.
 More bits also result in larger
image files and longer scan
times. The scanner simply needs
more time to capture all those
bits. And the larger the image
file becomes, the more time and
power your computer and photo
software need to process your
pictures.
 Scan color photos at 24 bits (or
8 bits per channel). Most scan-
ners offer you a choice of bit
depth settings; common options
are 8 bits, 24 bits, and 48 bits.
With 8 bits, your scan can con-
tain only 256 colors, which typi-
cally creates the blotchy,
unacceptable result you see in
the top example in Figure 6-1.
Moving up to 24 bits gives you
more than 16.7 million colors,
which is more than enough for
most color photos, as illustrated
by the middle example.
Note that some scanner and
photo-editing programs —
including Photoshop Elements —
designate bit depth in terms of
bits per channel instead of total
bits. In an RGB (red-green-blue)
digital image, which contains
three channels, a bit depth of
8 bits per channel is the same
thing as 24 bits.
8-bit
24-bit
48-bit
Figure 6-1: Bit depth determines how many
colors a scanned image can contain.

 More than 24 bits is probably overkill. Many scanners can scan at a bit
depth higher than 24 bits, but whether you gain anything from so-called
high-bit scanning is questionable. In most cases, you won’t see any differ-
ence in your photo, as illustrated by the 24- and 48-bit examples in
Figure 6-1. See the sidebar “Should you go high bit?” for information
about when high-bit scanning can come in handy and the price you pay
for those added bits.
 For black-and-white photos, 8 bits is fine. A black-and-white image con-
tains only one color channel, and the 256 shades you get with an 8-bit
image are sufficient. See the next section for more on this topic.
Scanning black-and-white photos
In digital imaging, what most of us
know as a black-and-white photo is
called a grayscale image. A grayscale
image can contain 256 colors —
black, white, plus shades of gray. A
true black-and-white image, on the
other hand, can contain only two
colors: black and white. Figure 6-2
shows you the difference.
Refer to your scanner manual to find
out how it deals with this issue. On
some models, choosing the black-
and-white scan setting produces a 2-
bit scan; on other models, a setting
with the same name produces an 8-
bit scan. Remember: The bit setting
determines how many colors the
scan can generate. With 2 bits, you
can have only two colors (black and
white); with 8 bits, you get 256 colors,
which, again, works just fine for
black-and-white photos.
Saving your scan files
When you scan directly into
Photoshop Elements, the first thing
to do after the scan is created is to
save the new file; Elements doesn’t
do it automatically for you. When you
save, set the file format either to the
Photoshop format (PSD) or TIFF.
These two formats are the only

2 bit

standard formats that retain all your original image data. Do not save your
original files in the JPEG format, which produces smaller files but tosses some
picture data. (See Chapters 1 and 2 for more information about file formats.)
This same advice applies if you aren’t scanning directly into your photo soft-
ware but instead are using your scanner’s software alone. The software
should offer an option that enables you to choose which format you want to
use when storing your scans; JPEG and TIFF are common options.
Applying dust removal and other correction filters
Although the software provided by most scanners offers tools for adjusting
exposure, focus, and color, you can get better results and more control over
these corrections in your photo editor. The tools found in scanning software
are less sophisticated than those offered in photo-editing programs. And
when you apply corrections through your scanner software, you can’t limit
them to just the problem areas, as you can in a photo editor.
The pros and cons of high-bit images
Some digital cameras and scanners can pro-
duce high-bit images, which are generally
defined as having a bit depth of more than 24 bits.
Bit depth, as described earlier in this chapter,
determines how many colors an image can con-
tain. A 24-bit image can contain more than 16.7
million colors, which is standard — and usually
perfectly acceptable — for color photographs.
So why the option for more bits? Well, if you
make really extreme adjustments to a 24-bit
image, you can introduce banding, also known
as posterization. This defect creates abrupt
breaks in areas where you should have smooth
color transitions, giving the image a somewhat
splotchy look. The 8-bit image in Figure 6-1 has
this problem, which also occurs when you scan
a photo at a low bit depth — there simply aren’t
enough colors to produce a quality image.
Theoretically, starting with a higher-bit original
enables you to apply more severe corrections
to your photo before banding starts to appear,
but in the real world, all those extra bits are no
guarantee against the problem. And adding bits
has several disadvantages: Scanning takes
longer; the size of the scan file is larger; and,
most important, many photo-editing programs
either can’t open high-bit files or don’t offer the
full range of tools for high-bit images. (Elements
falls in the latter camp.)
If you opt for high-bit image capture and you
use Elements, do your exposure and color cor-
rections inside that program first. Then convert
the file to a 24-bit image (by choosing Image➪
Mode➪8 Bits/Channel) so that you regain the
use of the program’s entire suite of tools.

The one exception to this rule is the dust removal filter provided by some 
scanners, which goes by different names depending on the manufacturer.
You may be able to save yourself some image-cleanup time by turning on
this feature. (Even if you clean your original carefully, some dust specks are
inevitable.) But understand that these tools usually work by applying a slight
blur to your image, so do some tests to see how much difference the dust-
removal option makes.
Adding Density to Faded Photos
Sunlight, environmental pollution, and plain old passing time can cause
photographs to fade. Your first instinct when restoring a faded photo like
the one in Figure 6-3 might be to try to increase color saturation, using the
Hue/Saturation filter discussed later in this chapter, or to increase contrast
by using the Levels filter, introduced in Chapter 4. Both approaches can
help — although the saturation filter has no effect on a black-and-white
photo, of course.
Figure 6-3: The colors in this old photo have faded over time.
153
Chapter 6: Bringing Back Lost Memories

154

But before you use either filter, try this alternative trick, which involves a
special layer-blending mode called Multiply. (If you’re new to layers, check out
Chapter 5.) This mode actually multiplies the pixel values on two layers,
which increases color density and pro-
duces slightly better results than using
either Levels or Hue/Saturation.
Here’s how it works:
1. Open the Layers palette, shown in
Figure 6-4.
Choose Window➪Layers to display
the palette.
On the DVD, see the QuickTime
movie “Getting Started with Adobe
Photoshop Elements” if you want
your Layers palette to appear as a
free-floating window, as shown in
the figure.
2. Duplicate the Background layer.
You can do this by simply dragging
the layer to the New Layer icon, as
illustrated in Figure 6-4. I’m assuming
that you haven’t added any other
layers to your image; if you have,
duplicate whatever layer holds your
original image pixels.
3. Choose Multiply from the Blending
Mode drop-down list in the Layers
palette.
The Blending Mode control is
labeled in Figure 6-5. You see an
instant increase in color density, as
illustrated in my multiplied photo in
Figure 6-6.
Blending Mode
Figure 6-5: Select Multiply as the
blending mode for the duplicate layer.
New Layer icon
Figure 6-4: Duplicate your original image
layer by dragging it to the New Layer icon.

Figure 6-6: Multiplying my original image once was enough to restore color density.
4. To increase density even more, duplicate the Multiply layer.
Just drag the multiplied layer to the New Layer icon. You can duplicate
the layer as many times as needed to achieve the desired change.
If duplicating the layer produces too strong a shift, just lower the opac-
ity of the duplicated layer by using the Opacity control in the Layers
palette. You also can use your Eraser tool on the top Multiply layer to
erase areas that become too dark. See Chapters 5 and 7 for more about
the Eraser tool.
5. Merge the original and multiplied layers by choosing Layer➪Flatten
Image.
After you beef up the photo density using this technique, you may be able
to improve things even more by next applying the Levels or Hue/Saturation
filter to adjust contrast and saturation, respectively.
As you can see from my multiplied image in Figure 6-6, the technique also
makes any dirt or scratches more visible. You can remove these flaws using
the Clone tool and Dust & Scratches filter, which I cover near the end of this
chapter.

Shining Light through Dense Scans
Some types of slide film are very
dense and thus a challenge for most
scanners. The image in Figure 6-7,
scanned from a decades old
Kodachrome slide, is a case in point.
Although I could boost the scan
exposure to get a brighter image
than what you see in the figure, I
couldn’t lighten the shadows suffi-
ciently without blowing out the 
highlights. Recovering blown high-
lights in a photo editor is pretty
much impossible, so it’s best to
set up the scan to capture the high-
lights appropriately and then try to
dig out shadow detail after the fact.
You can try brightening the scanned
photo by applying the Shadows/
Highlights filter, which you can read
about in Chapter 4. If your photo
editor doesn’t have such a tool, you
may be able to get some benefit from
the Levels filter, also explored in
Chapter 4, or its equivalent. But for
really dense scans like the one in
Figure 6-7, I sometimes get better
results by using this alternative approach:
1. Duplicate the original Background layer by dragging it to the New
Layer icon in the Layers palette.
Refer to Figure 6-4 if you need a reminder of this technique.
2. Set the blending mode of the new layer to Screen, as shown in
Figure 6-8.
This blending mode has the opposite impact as the Multiply mode dis-
cussed in the preceding section — that is, Screen mixes the layer pixels
in a way that results in an immediate brightening of your image. You can
see the results on my example image in Figure 6-8.
If this step produces good results, skip to Step 4. Otherwise, move on to
Step 3.
Figure 6-7: There’s hidden detail lurking in the
shadows of this old, too-dark photo.

Figure 6-8: Screening a duplicate of the Background layer brightens the image.
3. Apply the Shadows/Highlights filter to the new, screened layer.
First, make sure that the screened layer — your duplicate layer — is
selected, or highlighted, in the Layers palette, as shown in Figure 6-8. If
not, click that layer. Then choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/
Highlights to apply the filter.
I used the filter settings shown in Figure 6-9 to produce the result shown
to the left of the dialog box. In addition to lightening the shadows, I used
the Darken Highlights control to tone down some of the brightest areas
of the picture, which became too bright after Step 2. (You can also apply
the Eraser tool on the screened layer to rub away any areas that remain
too bright.)
If necessary, you can brighten the image even more by duplicating your
Screen layer.
4. When you’re happy with the photo, choose Layer➪Flatten Image.
This step merges the screened and filtered layer with the original
Background layer.

Figure 6-9: Applying the Shadows/Highlights filter to the screened layer further improved the image.
Why not just keep reapplying the Shadows/Highlights filter multiple times to
the image? Because doing so tends to produce some weird color variations.
As always, your mileage may vary, so it never hurts to experiment — but
keep an eye out for odd color distortions if you apply Shadows/Highlights
with a heavy hand.
You may find that very dense scans also suffer from too-saturated colors, in
which case you can apply the Hue/Saturation filter, explained later in this
chapter, to pull the colors back a little. Also, brightening a very dark image
tends to introduce noise, a defect that looks like tiny grains of colored sand.
You can improve things somewhat by applying a blur filter to the noisiest
areas; see Chapter 4 for an introduction to one common blur filter.
Correcting Colors
If your photo collection is anything like mine, it’s rare to come across a color
photo that’s more than a decade old and still showing its original colors.
Back in my day — shall we say, before the turn of the current century —
people didn’t know that the plastic sleeves used by some photo albums were
going to wreak havoc on pictures, causing all sorts of color shifts. Old slides,
too, often exhibit color fading, color shift, or both.

Most photo-editing programs offer tools for correcting colors, and they usu-
ally produce pretty good results or at least enable you to make noticeable
improvements to your photos. The next two sections discuss two common
color-fixer tools: a one-click tint remover and a more sophisticated option
known as a color-balance filter.
You also can use these tools for color correction of digital photos. But if pic-
tures from your digital camera exhibit a color cast, the cause is likely related
to the camera’s white-balance setting. Visit Chapter 2 to find out how to
adjust the setting to prevent the problem.
Removing a color cast with one click
Being the second of three children, I share the same fate as all middle kids:
The family album contains loads of pictures of the first-born child, plenty of
the last baby, but precious few of, well, me. So you can imagine my delight
when I came across the picture in Figure 6-10, even though I had to dig
through my grandparents’ photo stash to find it. Ah, life was good that Easter
Sunday. Little sister had not yet arrived, and for a brief, shining moment,
yours truly was the center of attention. Too bad that this rare piece of history
is spoiled by an ugly red color cast.
Figure 6-10: Like many old photos, this one has a color problem.

Chapter 6: Bringing Back Lost Memories

Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Fortunately, many photo programs offer a tool that can eliminate a color cast
with a single click of a mouse. The tool works pretty much the same way in
every program: You click on a pixel that you think should be white, black, or
gray, and the software shifts the color values as needed to neutralize the
color cast.
To apply the tool in Elements, follow these steps:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast.
Be sure to choose the Remove Color Cast command, not the Remove
Color command. The dialog box shown in Figure 6-11 should appear
after you choose the command.
Figure 6-11: The Remove Color Cast filter can correct colors with a single click.
2. Click an area in the photo that should be white, black, or gray.
After you click, Elements shifts all the image colors in attempt to remove
the color cast. For my image, I clicked the curtains in the background,
which memory told me were light gray.
Don’t simply click another pixel if your first click doesn’t remove the
color cast. Instead, click the Reset button in the dialog box and then
click a new pixel in your photo. And note that if you click a pixel that’s
absolutely black or white, you don’t get any color shift. (The tool wants
you to click something that should be white or black, but isn’t.)
3. When the color cast is gone, click OK to close the dialog box.
When this type of tool works, it works well; you can see my corrected tribute
to myself in Figure 6-12. But if you can’t neutralize the color cast after a few
tries, click Cancel to close the Remove Color Cast dialog box and turn to the
alternative filter discussed in the next section.

Figure 6-12: Clicking the curtains produced the correct colors.
Balancing colors
In addition to a simple, one-click
color remover, your photo software
may offer a color-balance filter. This
tool is based on the RGB color
wheel, which you can inspect in
Figure 6-13.
This color wheel is different from
the one you learned about in grade
school, where you were taught that
red, yellow, and blue are the color
primaries and orange, green, and
violet are the secondaries. On the
RGB wheel, which is the one used in
digital imaging, the primaries are red, green, and blue — hence, RGB — and
cyan, magenta, and yellow are the secondaries. I bring all this up because the
RGB color wheel serves as the basis for many photo-editing tools, not just
the color-balance filter, and keeping it in mind will help you understand how
those tools work.

Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Anyway, a color-balance filter enables you to add more of one color and 
subtract its opposite. For example, increasing blue results in an equal dimin-
ishing of yellow. Some color-balance filters, including the one in Elements,
enable you to make these color shifts in the highlights, shadows, and mid-
tones independently. Either way, you get more control than with a color-cast
removal tool, which seeks only to neutralize colors.
As an example of how color balancing works, take a look at Figure 6-14. I shot
this picture so long ago that I can’t quite remember what the actual colors
were, but I’m pretty sure they didn’t look like they do in the figure — too
heavy in the reds, magentas, and yellows. By subtracting those colors, which
in turn adds cyan, green, and blue, I can get things more in balance.
Figure 6-14: This landscape has a serious color-balance problem.
In Elements, the color-balance tool is called the Color Variations filter, and
you apply it like so:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations.
The dialog box shown in Figure 6-15 appears. At the top of the dialog
box, you get a Before and After preview.
2. At the bottom of the dialog box, click the Shadows, Midtones, or
Highlights button.
Again, Elements enables you to adjust each brightness range individu-
ally. I generally start with the midtones.

Figure 6-15: Click a color-shift thumbnail to add more of that color and subtract its opposite.
3. Click the color-shift thumbnails to adjust the color balance for the
selected brightness range.
You get three pairs of color-shift thumbnails, highlighted in Figure 6-15.
When you click one thumbnail, you add more of that color and subtract
an equal amount of the color that’s opposite on the RGB color wheel.
The thumbnail labels, though, can be a little confusing. The lower
thumbnails are labeled Decrease Red, Decrease Green, and Decrease
Blue, but they could just as easily be labeled Increase Cyan, Increase
Magenta, and Increase Yellow. Remember, adding one color subtracts its
color-wheel opposite.
4. If you don’t like the results of your last change, reverse it by clicking
the Undo button on the right side of the dialog box.

how much change occurs with each thumbnail click. Drag the slider to
the right to produce a more intense color change. (The slider setting
affects your next thumbnail click.)
If you get completely off track, click the Reset Image button, near the
Undo button, to go back to square one and start over.
5. Repeat the process with the remaining brightness ranges.
Stay away from the Saturation option and the Lighten and Darken
thumbnails. Instead, use the Hue/Saturation filter, discussed in the next
section, to adjust saturation. To adjust exposure, use the filters that I
discuss in Chapter 4. The filters give you more control than the options
in the Color Variations dialog box.
6. When you’re satisfied with your image colors, click OK to close the
dialog box.
Figure 6-16 shows you my corrected landscape image. 
Figure 6-16: A pass through the Color Variations filter corrected the image.
Adjusting color saturation
At the start of this chapter, I show you how to strengthen faded colors by
using the Multiply blending mode. That technique can work wonders when a
photo is significantly lacking in color. When colors are only slightly faded, as
in the left image in Figure 6-17, the Multiply technique typically produces too
strong a result.

Figure 6-17: A slightly faded Christmas memory (left) is good as new after an application of the
Hue/Saturation filter (right).
To apply a subtle saturation boost, instead turn to a Saturation filter, found in
most photo-editing programs. In Elements, you apply this tool as follows: 
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation.
The dialog box shown in Figure 6-18 appears.
2. Select a color range from the Edit drop-down list at the top of the
dialog box.
If you select Master, as shown in Figure 6-18, the filter affects all colors in
your image. As an alternative, you can adjust six individual color ranges
by selecting a range from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 6-19. In
case you’re curious, these six color ranges represent the three primary
and three secondary colors on the RGB color wheel, which I introduce in
the preceding section.
3. Drag the Saturation slider to adjust color intensity.
Drag to the right to increase color saturation. Drag left to decrease 
saturation. For my holiday photo, I increased the saturation of all colors
first. Then I gave a small extra boost just to the reds and the yellows.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.

Figure 6-18: Set the Edit option to Master to adjust saturation 
of all image colors.
Figure 6-19: You also can adjust the saturation of a single 
color range.

One final word about saturation: Increasing saturation won’t bring color back
to areas that are so faded that they’re white or very light gray. If you want to
restore color to such areas, try the painting technique that I discuss near the
end of Chapter 5.
Cloning Over Holes and Other Defects
Almost every photo-editing program offers a Clone tool, which enables you
to duplicate good areas of your photo and then paint the copied pixels onto
areas you need to cover up. This tool, although a little hard to understand at
first, is an invaluable photo-restoration weapon. You can use it to rid your photo
of scratches, holes, water stains, and just about any other type of damage.
For example, I used the Clone tool to repair the stained area in the top-right
corner of the image you see in Figure 6-20. I also cloned away the scratch
that runs diagonally through the photo. You can see the results in Figure 6-21.
Figure 6-20: This image is marred by some discoloring in the sky as well as a long scratch.

Chapter 6: Bringing Back Lost Memories

168
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Figure 6-21: I used the Clone tool to copy neighboring pixels over the problem areas.
Here’s how to wield the Elements version of this tool:
1. Open the Layers palette and create a new, empty layer to hold your
cloned pixels.
You can open the palette by choosing Window➪Layers. Then click the
New Layer icon, labeled in Figure 6-22.
2. Select the Clone Stamp tool, labeled in Figure 6-22.
Be sure to select the Clone Stamp, and not the Pattern Stamp, which is
on the same flyout menu in the toolbox. (Most people refer to this tool
simply as the Clone tool, and I do the same from here on.)
3. Select a brush from the Brushes palette, labeled in Figure 6-22.
To help your cloned pixels blend with the original area, match the brush
softness to the area you need to repair. If the area features soft focus,
choose a soft brush. If you’re fixing a sharply focused region, use a hard-
edge brush instead. Remember that in the Brushes palette, the brush
icons with the fuzzy edges indicate a soft brush. 

Figure 6-22: Always do your cloning on a separate layer.
4. On the options bar, set the Mode control to Normal and the Opacity
control to 100%.
At these settings, your cloned pixels completely cover the original pixels
you want to hide.
5. Turn on the Aligned option.
This option enables you to perfectly duplicate a large area without
having to complete the whole process with one drag. (More about
aligned and non-aligned cloning later.)
6. Turn on the Sample All Layers option.
Now the tool can duplicate pixels from your original image but paste the
duplicates onto your new layer. As discussed in Chapter 5, doing your
retouching work on layers gives you extra safety and flexibility.

7. Set the clone source by 
Alt-clicking (Windows) or
Option-clicking (Mac) at the
spot where you want to begin
duplicating pixels.
Wow, that’s a mouthful. To break
it down: First, press and hold
down the Alt key or the Option
key, depending on whether you
use Windows or Mac. As soon
as you press the key, you see
the target-cursor shown in
Figure 6-23. Move the cursor
over the spot where you want to
begin lifting good pixels — your
clone source pixels, in tech lingo.
Click to set the clone source and
then release the Alt or Option
key. In the example image, I set
my clone source on the good sky
pixels that lie just to the left of
the stained area and the scratch.
8. Drag over the defect you need
to cover.
As soon as you begin to drag,
you see two cursors, as shown
in Figure 6-24. The crosshair
cursor represents the current
clone source — the pixels
you’re copying — and the round
cursor indicates your clone
brush. The two cursors move 
in tandem as you drag, and
Elements paints the copied
source pixels over the pixels
you touch with your tool brush.
In the figure, I’ve cloned some of
the good sky pixels over part of
the scratch and stain.
If you let up on your mouse
button, the crosshair cursor dis-
appears. But as soon as you
begin a new drag, it reappears,
and you continue cloning from
the area you left off. 
9. Keep cloning until the defect is completely hidden.
Target cursor
Figure 6-23: The first step is to set the initial
clone source position.

Clone tool brush
Figure 6-24: The crosshair represents your
clone source; the round cursor, the tool brush.

At any time, you can reset the clone source as needed by Alt- or Option-
clicking again. You may need to do this many times in the course of
making a single repair.
10. Merge the clone layer with the original image layer by choosing
Layer➪Flatten Image.
Now your cloned pixels are permanently set in place over the flaw.
That’s the basic cloning process. Trust me, it won’t make much sense until
you actually try it for yourself, and even then, most people need a few run-
throughs to completely get the hang of this tool.
In the meantime, here are a few cloning tips to keep in mind:
 If you don’t want your cloned pixels to fully cover the original area,
adjust the Opacity of the Clone tool via the control on the options bar.
For example, you may want to do this when cloning over blown high-
lights. Cloning at a lower opacity enables you to tone down the highlights
without completely obliterating them.
 You can use the Eraser tool on the clone layer to wipe away any badly
cloned areas. Chapters 5 and 7 explain more about the Eraser tool.
 If you have only a few good pixels to use as the clone source, turn off the
Aligned option. Then, every time you let up on your mouse button at the
end of a cloning pass, the clone source resets to its original position, so
you can keep cloning those original pixels without having to keep Alt- or
Option-clicking.
To be honest, though, you don’t need to worry too much about whether
the Aligned option is on or off because you can always reset the clone
source at any time as needed. I tell you in Step 5 to turn the option on
because that setting makes understanding the tool easiest on the first
go-round. After that, use whichever setting appeals to you or works best
for the task at hand. 
 For small defects, such as spots of dust, you may be able to repair the
problem more quickly by using the Spot Healing Brush, covered in 
Chapter 5. Or, depending on the severity of the defects, you may be able
to eradicate them by using the Dust & Scratches filter, explained in the
next section.
 If you use Elements, also investigate the regular Healing Brush tool,
which works almost exactly like the Clone tool, except that after you
complete a cloning drag, the program adjusts the brightness, color, and
texture of the cloned pixels in an attempt to make them blend in more
naturally with their new surroundings.
 The DVD that accompanies this book contains a video lesson that gives
you a look at the Clone tool in action.

Removing Dust and Scratches
To remove specks of dust, tiny scratches, and other minor blemishes, you
can use either the Clone tool, explained in the preceding section, or the Spot
Healing Brush, introduced in Chapter 5. This type of cleanup work isn’t diffi-
cult, but it is tedious and time-consuming, especially when you’re looking at
an image as dusty as the one you see in Figure 6-25. So before you pick up
either the Clone tool or the Spot Healing Brush, try applying a dust-removal
filter.
Figure 6-25: You could spend all day zapping each dust spot individually.
This type of filter, found in many photo editors, searches for the type of color
and brightness changes that typically indicate dust, scratches, and so on.
Then the filter applies a slight blur just to those areas, which can make the
flaws appear to fade into the background.
To use the Elements version of this filter, called the Dust & Scratches filter,
take these steps:

1. Choose Filter➪Noise➪Dust &
Scratches to display the dialog
box shown in Figure 6-26.
2. Set the Radius value to 1 and
the Threshold value to 0.
The Radius value controls the
strength of the blur effect. The
Threshold value determines how
much color or brightness differ-
ence must exist between neigh-
boring pixels before Elements
applies the blur to them. At a
Threshold setting of 0, even a
slight difference between pixels
results in the blur.
3. Raise the Radius value until
most of the dust disappears.
You usually need to stay in the
1–3 range; otherwise, you create
an unacceptable amount of blurring.
4. Raise the Threshold value as far as you can without reintroducing the
dust or other defects.
By raising the value, you limit the blur just to the dirtiest areas of the
photo. You may need to play with both the Radius and Threshold values
to find the optimal tradeoff between image blurring and dust removal. 
I used the values you see in Figure 6-26 to produce the cleaned image in
Figure 6-27. The large scratch in the coat remains partially visible, but
the majority of the dust has disappeared.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Remove any remaining dust or scratches by using the Clone tool or Spot
Healing Brush.
Keep in mind that you probably won’t be able to completely remove intense
flaws with this filter, but you can at least spare yourself the chore of cleaning
up every speck of dust. After you apply the filter, you may want to apply the
Unsharp Mask filter to bring back some of the details that the Dust &
Scratches filter may have blurred. Chapter 4 explains how to use the Unsharp
Mask filter in a way that keeps the filter from making dust visible again.
(Raise the Threshold value slightly in the filter dialog box.)
173
Chapter 6: Bringing Back Lost Memories
Figure 6-26: The Dust & Scratches filter can
speed up your clean-up work.

174
Part II: Easy Digital Darkroom Repairs 
Figure 6-27: A light application of the filter removed most of the dust, leaving just a 
little touch-up work to do with the Clone tool.
If the dust and dirt are isolated in one area, follow the Chapter 4 instructions
to select just that part of the photo before you apply the Dust & Scratches
filter. That way, you don’t run the risk of destroying image detail in the rest of
the picture.

If you are, check out the projects in this part
of the book. In Chapter 7, you ﬁnd out how to
paste pictures together and then manipulate the
bits and pieces to create a collage, a digital scrap-
book page, or just about anything else you have in
mind. I also show you how to combine pictures
in a way that leaves no evidence of your creative
input behind — a neat trick if you want to put an
object into a new background, for example. To fur-
ther expand your artistic possibilities, Chapter 8’s
projects explore all sorts of photo embellishments,
including text and special effects.

I
have in my bedroom one of those photo-collage frames — the ones that
have a matte precut with holes of different shapes and sizes so that you
can display a bunch of photographs together. Most of the images are
pretty dated, but I’ve put off swapping them out because it’s
such a pain. In most cases, you have to tape or glue the
photos into place when putting the arrangement together,
so you run the risk of tearing your original prints, the
matte, or both if you want to change things. Besides,
now that I’ve gone digital, I can create a new photo
collage with a lot less effort and mess.
This chapter explains the art of photo compositing,
which is a fancy way of saying “pasting pictures
together.” Whether you want to build a collage,
blend two photos to create a fantasy image — putting
your head on someone else’s body, for example — or
simply paste a group of pictures together so that you
can print them on the same sheet of photo paper, you can
use the techniques in this chapter to get the job done.
To find out how to add text and other embellishments to your creation, see
Chapter 8. And be sure to check out the DVD that accompanies this book, too.
It offers QuickTime movies that demonstrate most of the techniques I cover in
this chapter. (See the movies titled “Gluing Photos Together with Digital Paste,”
“Advanced Image Blending,” and “Creating Cool Backgrounds.”)

Building a Photo Collage
When most people hear the word collage, they think of something like the
image in Figure 7-1. But the collage techniques I explain in this chapter apply
to any creation that involves pasting one picture into another — even some-
thing as simple as the two-picture combo featured in the left example in
Figure 7-2. The approach is the same no matter how many pictures you want
to combine and whatever creative design you have in mind.
Figure 7-1: Creating a digital collage or scrapbook page is easier than you 
may imagine.
Figure 7-2: Thanks to digital magic, you can combine two photos in all sorts of creative ways.

If your goal is to join portions of multiple photos to create a scene that
appears to be a single photograph, as I did with the dog image at the end of
this chapter, you also start with the same basic collage-building steps. After
you join your photos, see the section “Blending Images into a New Reality” to
discover a few additional secrets to that kind of photo trickery.
Preparing a canvas for your creation
Always begin a collage by creating a new image file. A new file provides you
with a blank piece of virtual photo paper to serve as the foundation for your
creation, similar to an empty page in a scrapbook or photo album.
Even if you plan to use a photograph as your collage background, as I did in
Figure 7-2, starting with a new file is still a good idea in Elements and in other
programs that take a similar approach to layers. Here’s why: As I explain fully
in Chapter 5, every image in Elements starts life with one layer, the Background
layer, which is immovable and fully opaque. Atop that, you can add more
image layers that can be freely manipulated and can contain pixels of varying
opacity.
When you open an existing photograph, the immovable, inflexible
Background layer contains the original image pixels. If you simply paste
another picture into the image, your creative options are limited because you
can’t do much of anything with the pixels on the Background layer. You can
create something like the first example in Figure 7-2, but that’s about it.
But if you create a new image, you get a Background layer that’s filled with
solid color — white, by default. You then can paste your photos into new
layers atop the Background layer, in which case all the photo pixels are fully
movable and open to opacity adjustments. So you could, for example, reduce
the opacity of the bottom photo so that it appears faded and less visually
dominant than the jack-o’-lantern image, as I did for the middle image in
Figure 7-2.
You also can blend the bottom photo layer with the Background in some
interesting ways by taking advantage of layer-blending modes, as I did in the
right image in the figure. To create that version, I filled the Background layer
with brown and then set the blending mode of the lower pumpkin layer to
Saturation. (The upcoming section, “Playing with opacity and blending
modes,” shows you how to work with layer opacity and blending modes.)
If all this doesn’t quite make sense yet, don’t worry — it’ll become clear as
you start experimenting with collage building. So just trust me on this one for
now and take these steps to create a new image file in Elements:
1. Choose File➪New➪Blank File.
You see the New dialog box, shown in Figure 7-3.
179
Chapter 7: Copy, Paste, Create!

180
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
Figure 7-3: Creating a new canvas for your composition provides extra 
creative flexibility.
2. Type a name for your collage in the Name box.
3. Set the image dimensions.
You can either select one of the standard photo sizes from the Preset
drop-down list — I chose 5 x 7 in Figure 7-3 — or type in custom dimen-
sions in the Width and Height boxes.
If you plan to print the image, set the unit of measurement via the drop-
down lists adjacent to the Width and Height boxes. You can select
inches, picas, or whatever traditional measurement unit strikes your
fancy. If the image is destined only for the screen, set the unit of mea-
surement to pixels and follow the Chapter 3 guidelines regarding setting
the display size of an on-screen picture.
4. Specify the image resolution in the Resolution box (for print only).
I repeat: This setting is relevant only for print purposes. It determines
the number of pixels per inch in your printed photo, which affects your
print quality. A resolution of 300 pixels per inch is appropriate for most
purposes, but if you’re preparing an image for use in a publication such
as a newsletter or magazine, ask the publication’s art director for
guidelines.
5. Select RGB Color from the Color Mode drop-down list.
This assumes that you want your collage to contain color elements. If
not, you can instead select Grayscale for a black-and-white image. Don’t
select Bitmap, which restricts your picture to only black and white, with
no shades of gray.

6. Set the Background Contents option to White.
Your new image will contain one layer, the Background layer, which
Elements will fill with the color you select here. For now, just choose
white; you can fill the layer with another color later if desired. See the
next section for details.
7. Click OK.
Your new, empty canvas appears in its own image window. And, as
promised, the image contains one layer, the Background layer, which is
filled with solid white. You can view the layer by displaying the Layers
palette (Window➪Layers).
To find out how to add color or texture to your new background, see the next
two sections.
Changing the canvas color
Replacing the original, white background that you create in the preceding
steps with a colored or textured background can make a significant impact
on your composition. Compare the image in Figure 7-4, for example, with the
original in Figure 7-1. The white background gives the collage a more conserv-
ative look than the yellow background.
Figure 7-4: Changing the background color gives the collage a warmer look.

Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
The following steps show you how to change the color of your Background
layer in Elements:
1. Open the Layers palette by choosing Window➪Layers.
You can see the bottom three layers of my updated Boston collage in
Figure 7-5. Your Background layer will appear white in the palette thumb-
nail if you haven’t yet adjusted its color.
Figure 7-5: Fill the Background layer with color with the Fill Layer command.
2. If your image contains multiple layers, select the Background layer by
clicking it in the Layers palette.
You don’t need to take this step if you haven’t added any photos to your
background yet.

3. Choose Edit➪Fill Layer.
The Fill Layer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
4. Select Color from the Use drop-down list to open the Color Picker,
shown in Figure 7-6.
To set up the color picker so that it appears as in the figure, click the H
option button. Now click or drag in the vertical color bar to select a
basic hue. Adjust saturation and brightness by dragging or clicking in
the larger color field next to the color bar.
Figure 7-6: Set the main hue via the slider bar and adjust saturation 
and brightness in the large color field.
The top color preview, labeled New Color in Figure 7-6, shows you the
color you’ve selected. The lower preview shows the color you chose on
your last trip to the Fill Layer dialog box.
When you find a color you like, click OK to close the dialog box and
return to the Fill Layer dialog box.
5. Set the Blending Mode option to Normal and the Opacity option to 100%.
These are the default settings, so you probably won’t need to adjust them.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and fill the Background layer with
your selected color.

Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
You don’t have to stick with the color that you originally set via the Fill Layer
box. You can change the color at any time by simply repeating these steps.
However, there’s an even easier option:
1. Click the Background layer in the Layers palette to select it.
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Colors➪Adjust Hue/Saturation to open the
Hue/Saturation dialog box, shown in Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7: After setting the initial canvas color, adjust it via the Hue/Saturation filter.
3. Adjust the background color by dragging the Hue, Saturation, and
Lightness sliders.
If you select the Preview check box, you can monitor the color change
in the image window, a benefit you don’t get when you use the Fill Layer
command. 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
You can use this trick to alter the color of any selected object or layer, by the
way. (Unfortunately, the filter has no effect on white or black pixels, which is
why you can’t use it to change the color of your initial white background.)
However, don’t use the Lightness slider for anything but changing the color
of a background or other solid color element; to adjust the brightness of a
photograph, apply one of the exposure filters discussed in Chapter 4.
Creating a textured background
To add even more spice to your background, you can fill it with a texture,
as I did for the collage variation shown in Figure 7-8. The result is similar
to a textured matte that you can buy in your local framing store. Here’s how
you create this effect in Elements:

Figure 7-8: Two shades of yellow serve as the basis for a subtly textured background. 
1. Click the Background layer in the Layers palette to select it.
2. In the toolbox, click the Foreground Color swatch, labeled in Figure 7-8,
to open the Color Picker.
This swatch represents the current foreground paint color.
3. In the Color Picker, select the main color for the textured background
that you want to create.
For the example photo, I stuck with the original golden yellow I used in
the earlier version of the collage.
4. Now click the Background Color swatch, also labeled in the figure,
and select a slightly darker or lighter color to serve as the secondary
texture color.
I chose a paler shade of yellow for my background paint color.
5. Choose Filter➪Texture➪Texturizer.
You see the dialog box in Figure 7-9. On the left side of the dialog box,
you see a preview of the texture effect. Use the controls on the right to
adjust the texture design.
6. Click OK to apply the texture and close the dialog box.

Figure 7-9: The Texturizer filter produces some great background textures.
If you’re not happy with the results, you can easily adjust the color, intensity,
and brightness of the textured background by applying the Hue/Saturation
filter as outlined at the end of the preceding section.
I demonstrate how to create this textured background as well as other back-
ground designs on the QuickTime movie titled “Creating Cool Backgrounds,”
included on the DVD that ships with this book.
Resizing your canvas
If you find that your original background isn’t large enough to hold all the
photos in your composition, you can change its size at any time. You don’t do
this through the Image Size command that you use to set print dimensions —
that command resizes your entire composition. Instead, you use the Canvas
Size command.
Note that I use the term canvas in this chapter to describe the white
Background layer that you create as the first step in collage building —
a metaphor for a real artist’s canvas, if you will. But in Elements, the word
has an official meaning. In Elements, the canvas refers to the virtual piece
of paper on which every photo lives. When you open a photograph, you
don’t see the canvas because your photo pixels completely cover it. And if
you create a new image file, Elements covers the canvas with white, opaque
pixels by default. The canvas becomes visible only when you enlarge it or
if you delete or erase something on the Background layer.

At any rate, you adjust the official canvas — which also extends your
Background layer, or metaphorical canvas — like so:
1. Choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size.
Figure 7-10 shows the Canvas Size dialog box that appears when you
choose the command.
Figure 7-10: Choose the Canvas Size command to enlarge 
an existing canvas.
2. Set the new canvas size.
You can do this in two ways:
• Deselect the Relative check box, as shown in Figure 7-10, and enter
the new dimensions in the Width and Height boxes.
• Select the Relative check box and then type the amount of canvas
that you want to add. For example, if you want to add 2 inches to
the width of the canvas, enter 2 in the Width box and set the
Height box to 0.
3. Click an Anchor square to position the image on the new canvas.
The empty square — the one without an arrow — represents where your
existing image will be placed on the new canvas. If you click the center
square, as shown in the figure, your image will appear centered on the
enlarged canvas.

Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
4. Select a color from the Canvas Extension Color drop-down list.
The new canvas area will take on this color. You can set the color to the
current Background or Foreground paint color (the ones represented by
the swatches in the toolbox), white, black, or gray. Or, by choosing
Other from the drop-down list, you can open the Color Picker dialog box
and select some other color.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
The enlarged canvas becomes visible in the image window.
You use the same process to reduce the canvas size. After you click OK in
Step 5, Elements displays a message warning that some of the image will be
clipped away. Click Proceed to finish the resizing process. (You also can
simply use the Crop tool to trim away the entire perimeter of the canvas.)
Adding photos to the collage
Pasting photos into your collage background is pretty simple. Well, okay,
nothing’s simple when you’re first starting with digital photography, but com-
pared to, say, understanding file formats and resolution, combining photos is
a lot less brain frazzling.
In fact, if you’ve ever copied and pasted text in a word processor or your
e-mail program, you already know the two commands involved in this bit of
digital magic: Copy and Paste.
 Copy: With the Copy command, you can duplicate an entire photo or a
portion of a photo.
 Paste: You choose this command to glue the copied photo into the
active image.
The following steps show you how to copy and paste in Elements. Things
work much the same in every other photo editor, although the location of the
Copy and Paste commands may differ. The QuickTime movie titled “Gluing
Photos Together with Digital Paste,” on the DVD that accompanies this book,
demonstrates this process.
1. Open the pictures that you want to paste together.
For clarity’s sake, I’ll refer to the picture that you want to copy and paste
into the collage Picture A and call the background image Picture B.
2. Make Picture A the active picture.
In Elements, just click the image window or choose the image name from
the bottom of the Window menu.
3. Select the portion of Picture A that you want to copy and paste.

Chapter 4 gives you an introduction to selecting in Elements. If you want
to select the entire picture, choose Select➪All. You should see the
dotted selection outline around the image.
4. Choose Edit➪Copy.
The program copies the selected pixels and puts them in a temporary stor-
age tank known as the Clipboard in computer lingo. (Note that no dialog
box or other message appears after you choose the Copy command.)
5. Make Picture B the active image.
Again, just click the image window or choose the picture name from the
bottom of the Window menu in Elements.
6. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The copied portion of Picture A appears inside Picture B.
In Elements, as well as in some other programs, you also can copy and
paste by simply dragging a selected area from one image to another.
Here’s how:
1. Display both image windows side by side, as shown in Figure 7-11.
You can choose Window➪Images➪Tile to display the windows for all
open images in the work area. Then drag the windows by their title bars
(tops) to arrange them.

2. Click the window for Picture A and then select the portion of the pic-
ture you want to copy.
If you want to copy the entire picture, you can skip this step.
3. Select the Move tool, labeled in Figure 7-11.
I cover the Move tool in more detail in the upcoming section “Moving
photos and objects with the Move tool,” but for now, don’t worry about
the settings of the options bar controls.
4. Click and drag the selected area into Picture B, as illustrated in the
figure.
A little plus sign appears next to your cursor, as shown near the tip of
the red direction arrow in the figure. The plus sign indicates that you’re
copying a selection. (You don’t see the red arrow; I added that for illus-
trative purposes.)
As you begin to drag, the selected area or photo appears to be moving
out of its original window, but don’t panic. As soon as you let up on your
mouse button, Picture A returns to its original state, and the copy
appears inside Picture B.
Whichever copy-and-paste method you choose, a pasted photo or object
automatically appears on its own layer in Elements. You can view and
manage your image layers by choosing Window➪Layers, which displays the
Layers palette, shown in Figure 7-12. Layers are a critical part of photo com-
positing, so if this is your first encounter with this feature, make a quick side
trip to the beginning of Chapter 5 for an introduction.
Figure 7-12: In Elements, a pasted photo or object 
appears on its own layer.

To bring the rest of your photos into the collage, just repeat the copy-and-
paste process. Or, if you prefer, head into the next section to find out how to
resize and reposition your newly pasted photo and take that step before
adding more pictures.
Resizing pasted photos
When you paste a photo or selected area into another image, it may appear to
change size in its new home. It really doesn’t; its size simply reflects whatever
difference exists between the pixel dimensions of both images. For example, if
your collage background has dimensions of, say, 1000 x 1000 pixels, and you
paste in an image that measures 3000 x 2000 pixels, the pasted photo fully
covers the background and then some. On the other hand, if your pasted
photo has a small pixel count, it may be tiny compared to your background.
You can easily resize any pasted photo as long as it remains on its own image
layer. But beware: Enlarging a digital image lowers quality. You can usually
get away with a little enlarging, but if you go too far, expect to seriously
degrade the picture. (See Chapter 2 for details on this issue.)
The steps for scaling — the image-geek term for resizing — the contents of a
layer in Elements are as follows:
1. Select the layer by clicking it in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Image➪Resize➪Scale.
Little boxes called handles appear around the perimeter of the selected
photo, as shown in Figure 7-13. You also see the options bar controls
shown in the figure.
3. Make sure that the Constrain Proportions check box on the options
bar is selected.
This option ensures that you don’t distort your photo as you resize it.
4. Drag any corner handle to resize the photo.
Don’t try to drag a side or top handle. If you do, the Constrain
Proportions option is automatically disabled, and you change only the
photo width or height, respectively, distorting the photo. If you mistak-
enly grab one of those handles, just select the Constrain Proportions
box again to automatically restore the original proportions.
If you have trouble sizing the picture by dragging a handle, you also
can type a value into the W (width) or H (height) box on the options bar.

5. Click the green check mark button to accept the size change.
Or, if you need to cancel out of the operation, click the neighboring red
cancel button instead. I labeled both buttons in Figure 7-13 (but note
that they may appear to the side of your photo instead of directly under-
neath, depending on the size of the image window).
Figure 7-13: Drag a corner handle to resize the pasted photo.
Rotating collage elements
To rotate the contents of a layer, first click the layer name in the Layers
palette. Then choose any command from the middle section of the Image➪
Rotate submenu. Be sure to select a command that has the word layer in its
name; the other commands, at the top of the Rotate menu, rotate the entire
image.
Handle
Accept
Cancel

If you choose the Free Rotate Layer command, you see the same handles and
options bar controls that appear when you choose the Scale command, dis-
cussed in the preceding section. Place your mouse pointer outside a corner
handle until you see a curved, double-headed arrow cursor like the one
labeled Rotate cursor in Figure 7-14. Then drag up or down to rotate the
layer. You also can enter a specific degree of rotation into the Rotate box on
the option bar, labeled in the figure. Either way, click the green check mark to
complete the rotation.
Figure 7-14: Drag outside a corner handle to rotate a collage element.
Positioning the collage photos
In Photoshop Elements, you have two ways to arrange the photos that you
place into your collage background. You can reposition a photo within its
own layer, or you can change the layer’s position in the stack of layers that
make up your collage. The next two sections provide details.
Moving photos and objects with the Move tool
To position a photo within the confines of its layer, just drag it with the Move
tool, labeled in Figure 7-15.

Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
Figure 7-15: Use the Move tool to drag a photo to a new position.
Here are a few details about the Move tool options:
 Auto Select Layer: When this option is enabled, Elements automatically
selects whatever layer contains the object on which you click, saving
you the trouble of clicking the layer name in the Layers palette to select
it. This feature is great unless the layer contains only a very small
object, in which case clicking the right spot to select the layer you want
can be tricky. If that occurs, just deselect the option and then select the
layer by clicking its name in the Layers palette.
 Show Bounding Box: This feature, when enabled, surrounds the layer
contents with a box similar to the one you get when you scale or rotate
the layer. You then can immediately shift into scale or rotate mode by
dragging one of the handles around the perimeter of the box. Because
it’s easy to inadvertently grab a handle, I suggest that you turn off the
option, however. Note that if part of your layer is hidden because the
photo on that layer is larger than your background, the bounding box
indicates the actual span of the photo, which can be helpful at times.
 Show Highlight on Rollover: This feature displays a bold outline around
the contents of layers that aren’t selected when you pass your cursor over
them. If the highlight helps you, turn it on; if it distracts you, disable it.
 Arrange: Click this drop-down list to access options that change the
layer’s placement in the layer stack. Or, to save time, see the next sec-
tion to find out how to do the same thing by using the Layers palette.
 Align and Distribute: With these options, you can align two or more
layers or space them evenly across a given area. To select the layers you
want to manipulate, click the first layer in the Layers palette and then
hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) as you click the other layers that
you want to align or distribute. Then choose the alignment or distribu-
tion option you want from the drop-down list on the options bar.
Move tool

Note that the last three options are new to Elements 5.0; in Version 4, you
must align and arrange your photos using the Move tool and the Layers
palette method described next.
After you select the Move tool, you can nudge a photo one pixel in any direc-
tion by pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard. Add the Shift key to nudge
the layer ten pixels in the direction of the arrow key.
Shuffling the layer stacking order
The position that a pasted photo occupies in the Layers palette determines
its stacking order in the composition. If two photos overlap, the one on the
upper layer appears to rest atop the one on the layer below. For example, in
Figure 7-16, you can see the stacking order for the Boston collage. Notice that
the crab photo is above the pond photo, so it obscures part of the pond. The
same thing applies to the other pairs of overlapping images. Where images
don’t overlap, the stacking order doesn’t matter.
Figure 7-16: When two photos overlap, the one on the upper layer hides a portion of the one below.
195
Chapter 7: Copy, Paste, Create!

196
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
In Elements 5.0, you can select a layer and then change its position in the
layer stack by using the Arrange drop-down list that appears when you select
the Move tool. (See the preceding section for details.) But an even faster solu-
tion is to simply drag the layer up or down in the Layers palette. When you
begin to drag, your cursor changes into a little fist to let you know you
grabbed the layer successfully. Figure 7-17 shows me in the process of drag-
ging the pond layer above the crab layer; in Figure 7-18, you see close-ups of
the result in the image and the Layers palette.
Figure 7-17: Drag a layer up or down to change 
its position in the stack.
Note that I renamed the layers in the figures in this chapter so that you can
more easily see what each one contains. By default, Elements names the
layers in the order you create them: Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on. The layer
number doesn’t restrict you in any way — you can move Layer 1 above Layer
2, for example. But if you want to change a layer name, double-click it in the
palette, type the new name, and press Enter.
Removing all or part of a pasted element
Suppose that you decide that you want to get rid of part of a layer in your col-
lage. For example, the left photo in Figure 7-19 shows one of the variations of
my pumpkins collage. To create the right image, I erased the background of
the jack-o’-lantern image.

Figure 7-18: After I moved the Pond layer above the Crab layer, the pond image hides part of 
the crab image. 
Figure 7-19: I erased the background of the jack-o’-lantern photo to 
create the variation on the right.
You can erase part of a layer in two ways:
 Select the area that you want to eliminate and press Delete on your key-
board. Chapter 4 offers an introduction to selecting if you need one.
 Grab the Eraser tool, labeled in Figure 7-20, and drag over the area you
want to remove. For best results, set the Mode control on the options
bar to Brush mode. Set the Opacity control to 100% to completely erase
the pixels you touch with the tool. At a lower opacity, erased pixels
remain partially visible.
197
Chapter 7: Copy, Paste, Create!

198
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
Figure 7-20: Set the tool Opacity to 100% to completely erase layer pixels.
If you select a hard brush from the Brushes palette, your Eraser strokes
have precise edges. If you select a soft brush, the strokes fade at the
edges. Which option works best depends on the effect you want to
create. In Figure 7-20, I chose a hard brush because I wanted a clean
edge between the jack-o’-lantern and the background photo. Remember
that the fuzzy icons in the Brushes palette represent soft brushes.
To completely eliminate a layer, just drag it to the Trash icon in the Layers
palette, labeled in Figure 7-20. Away goes the layer and everything on it.
Playing with opacity and blending modes
By using the Opacity and Blending Mode controls in the Layers palette, you
can create endless variations of your layered collage. In fact, I encourage you
to play around with these options — you’re bound to discover some creative
results that you wouldn’t otherwise imagine, which is part of the fun of digital
compositing.
Eraser

To get you started, here are the recipes I used to create the two variations of
the original pumpkins collage (refer to the right image in Figure 7-19):
 To produce the variation shown in Figure 7-21, I simply lowered the
Opacity value to 50% for the layer that holds the pumpkins image.
Because the underlying layer (the Background layer, in this case) is
white, the result is a faded version of the photo.
 To produce the version shown in Figure 7-22, I started by filling the
Background layer with brown. (See the earlier section “Changing the
canvas color” for details.) Then I set the Blending Mode option for the
pumpkins layer to Saturation. For this variation, I set the layer’s Opacity
value back to 100%.
The results you get from any blending mode using this recipe varies
depending on the colors in your photo and in the Background layer.
So after filling the Background layer with a solid color and choosing a
blending mode, use the Hue/Saturation filter to play with the color of the
Background layer. You can find details at the end of the earlier section,
“Changing the canvas color.”

To see an on-screen demonstration of working with layer opacity and blend-
ing modes, watch the QuickTime movie titled “Advanced Image Blending,”
on the DVD that accompanies this book. That same movie also includes a
demonstration of the techniques discussed in the following section. 
Blending Photos to Create a New Reality
If you weren’t reading a chapter about combining photos, you probably
wouldn’t be able to tell that something in the photo in Figure 7-23 isn’t
exactly as it appears — aside from the text effect, of course, which I added
using the Elements type tool, covered in the next chapter. The base photo of
the dog sitting next to a tree branch actually is a blend of two photos, which
you can see in Figure 7-24.
The idea for the photo, which provided the basis for a holiday greeting card,
was to make it look as though the dog had written the message in the snow
with the stick, a concept that my dog-owner friends thought was hilarious
Blending Mode control

and my “cat people” friends didn’t get. Anyway, I tried for some time to get
my dog to pose next to the stick, but if you’ve ever seen a Wheaten Terrier in
the snow, you know that it’s rare that they even sit still, let alone do it where
directed. So, I followed him around the yard and offered treats until he was
willing to cooperate and then quickly snapped the shot you see on the top in
Figure 7-24. Then, while he went off for another romp through the white stuff,
I took a second shot of just the stick. (I suspect that I keep my neighbors well
entertained with these little backyard adventures.)
Figure 7-23: The dog image actually is a blend of the two images in Figure 7-24.

shot of my dog.

Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
To create a seamless photo composite such as this, you follow the same
process as when building a collage. But depending on the two subjects that
you’re joining, you may need to add one or all of the following additional
steps:
 Match the color, sharpness, and tonal qualities of the images. For
example, the color and brightness of the snow in my original dog and
stick images weren’t exactly the same. So I adjusted the stick image to
match the dog image, using the filters and techniques covered in
Chapter 4. Because I used the same focus setting for both shots, they
were similar enough in that department that I didn’t need to adjust
sharpness.
 Blend the edges of the pasted object by erasing with a soft brush and
lowered opacity. Your goal is to fade the pasted object at the perimeter
so that the pixels gradually blend with the underlying background. For
example, I dragged the Eraser tool along the edge of the stick layer at
half opacity, as shown in Figure 7-25, resulting in snow pixels that
were half from the stick photo and half from the dog photo. (I hid the
underlying layers so that you can see just the stick layer in the figure.
The checkerboard pattern represents transparent pixels.) You may need
to adjust the Eraser tool opacity as you work; some areas may call for an
abrupt transition between the two images, and others may call for lower
opacity.
You can alternatively create a feathered selection outline before you
copy and paste the object. As detailed in Chapter 4, a feathered outline
also creates a pasted object that fades at the edges. However, sometimes
you don’t know in advance how much feathering will produce the best
blend with the destination photo, so I typically use a nonfeathered out-
line for copying and pasting and then use the Eraser tool to fuzz up the
edge of the pasted object.
 Recreate shadows, don’t copy them. If an object casts a shadow in its
original photo, don’t include that shadow when you copy and paste the
object. Why? Because the color and texture of a shadow in a photograph
usually reflects the surface on which it’s cast. So unless the background
into which you paste the object is very similar to its original back-
ground, that shadow may look odd. Instead, recreate the shadow using
the special effect option discussed in the next chapter.
 Be sure that both photos are of similar image quality. If the two are
very different in quality, the transition between them will be visible no
matter what other steps you take. For more on image quality, visit
Chapter 2.

Figure 7-25: I erased the edges of the stick photo with the Eraser tool set to 50% opacity so 
the snow pixels would be a blend of both images.
Merging or Preserving Collage Layers
I touch on this subject in Chapter 5, but it’s important enough to mention
again here. As you’re working on your collage, remember that you must save
the image file in either the TIFF format or the PSD (Photoshop) format and
you must enable the Layers check box in the Save As dialog box. Otherwise,
all your independent layers are merged together, and you can no longer freely
manipulate the collage elements.
When you’re finished with the collage, however, you can choose to merge all
the layers so that you can’t accidentally move something out of place. To do
so in Elements, choose Layer➪Flatten Image. Or you can simply save a copy
of the file with the Layers feature disabled in the Save As dialog box.
For more about saving files, see Chapter 3.

S
ome aspects of working with digital photos can be classified as, well, not

part of many photo projects, but I hardly consider it an entertaining
endeavor. 
This chapter, on the other hand, is all about Fun (with a capital F,
even). The projects you find here help you unleash your creative
side and add all sorts of embellishments to your pictures:
text, borders, special effects, and more. You also can find
out how to turn a full-color photo into a black-and-white
or sepia-toned image and how to create a faux frame or
matte.
I offer only one gentle word of caution before you enter
the playground: Don’t try to cram all your creative urges
into one photo. The photo, after all, should always be the
focal point of your creation, so be sure that whatever text
or effects you add work with the image rather than compete
with it for attention.

206
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
Writing on Your Pictures
Figure 8-1 shows you an unadorned photo along with a text effect that I cre-
ated in Photoshop Elements. Whether you want to create a fancy effect such
as this or just a plain headline such as the one I added to the Boston collage
in Chapter 7, you can do so easily in most photo programs.
I should qualify the “easily” part of that last sentence, though: Although cre-
ating short bits of text is simple, adding long blocks of text can be cumber-
some in a photo editor. So if your project involves more than a very short
paragraph, take the opposite approach to combining words and pictures.
Open whatever word-processing program you use — Microsoft Word, Corel
WordPerfect, or any of their lesser-known rivals — and create your text in
that program. Then add your pictures to the text document, instead of the
other way around. (You can find the steps for adding a picture to a Microsoft
Word document in Chapter 9.)
That caveat out of the way, the next section walks you through the basics of
using the Photoshop Elements Text tool. Following that, I show you how to
create text effects like the one in Figure 8-1 and how to position and other-
wise manipulate your text.
Figure 8-1: Simple images provide the best backdrop for complicated text effects.

Creating basic text
To add text in Elements, follow these steps:
1. Open the Layers palette by choosing Window➪Layers.
Elements creates text on its own layer, and you may need the palette
controls to manipulate your text after you create it. (For an introduction
to layers, see Chapter 5.)
2. If your image contains more than one layer, click the layer that’s
directly below where you want the text to go.
For example, if your image contains three layers and you want the text
layer to be above Layer 2, click that layer. If your image contains only
one layer, you can skip this step.
3. Select a Type tool from the toolbox.
Photoshop Elements gives you four tools for creating text:
• Horizontal Type tool: Use this tool to add regular text — that is,
type that reads from left to right, as in Figure 8-1.
• Vertical Type tool: If you want your type to read from top to
bottom, choose this tool instead.
• Horizontal and Vertical Type Mask tools: These tools enable you to
create a selection outline that’s in the shape of your type. The proj-
ects in this book don’t call for that particular task, but you can see
an example of one use of the feature in the Elements Help system.
You can convert a line of horizontal type to a vertical orientation
easily, so if you’re not sure which layout you want, just start with the
Horizontal Type tool, labeled in Figure 8-2. 
4. To add a single line of text, click the spot where you want to place the
first letter.
In addition to the tool cursor, you see a blinking insertion mark cursor,
similar to what you see in a word-processing program. This cursor shows
you where the next character you type will appear. You can reposition
your text later, so don’t worry about precise positioning when you click.
Move to Step 6 after you click.
5. To create a paragraph, drag to create a text box.
After you release the mouse button, you see a dotted outline that repre-
sents your text box, as shown in Figure 8-2. Again, you see both the tool
cursor and the insertion mark cursor, which indicates the position
where the next character you type will appear.
You can resize the text box if needed by dragging the square boxes, or
handles, that appear around its perimeter.

Figure 8-2: To create normal text, use the Horizontal type tool.
6. Set the initial text color.
After you click with the Horizontal or Vertical Type tool, the options
bar offers the controls you see in Figure 8-2. Click the Color swatch to
open the Color Picker and set the text color. (You can change the color
later also.)
With the Color Picker open, you can click in your image to select a color
that’s featured in the photo. For example, I clicked the rust-colored area
of my leaf photo to set my type color.
If you click the drop-down arrow instead of the Color swatch, you
display a palette of color swatches. You can either click one of those
swatches or click the More Colors button to open the Color Picker.

7. Select a font, type style, and type size.
Figure 8-3 shows a close-up view of the options bar controls that enable
you to establish these characteristics of your text. Note that some fonts
don’t offer variations in type style (bold, italic, and so on) but you can use
the “faux” style options to give the font a bold and italic look. (The official
styles are created by the font designer; the faux ones simply darken or
slant the text.) You also can add an underline or strikethrough using the
two icons to the right of the bold and italic faux style icons. And, yes, you
can adjust these properties of your text after you create it as well.
Figure 8-3: Set the font, size, and style through these controls.
8. Turn on the Anti-aliased feature, labeled in Figure 8-3.
Anti-aliasing smooths the jagged edges that can occur when you create
objects that have diagonal or curved lines in a photo program. Unless
you’re going for that jagged look for some reason, turn on the Anti-aliased
option.
9. Type your text.
The standard rules of computer-typing apply:
• To create a line break, press Enter.
• In a text box, press Tab to indent the line. (You don’t get any con-
trol over the position of the indent, however.)
• To delete a word, drag over it to highlight it and then press Delete.
You can also delete characters by using the Delete and Backspace
keys just as you do in a word processor. (Some Mac keyboards
don’t have a Backspace key, however.)

10. Adjust the text alignment, line spacing, and position if needed.
Use these techniques:
• Alignment: For type inside a text box, use the Alignment controls
labeled in Figure 8-4 to align the text with respect to the margins of
the box. Note that if you pressed Enter to create line breaks within
your text, you must align each line of type separately. Click inside
the line and then click an alignment option to do so.
Figure 8-4: Use the Leading option to adjust the spacing between lines.
• Line spacing (leading): To adjust spacing between lines, select the
text and then select a value from the Leading control, labeled in
Figure 8-4. If you select Auto, the program sets the leading (line
spacing) it deems appropriate for the current type size.
• Orientation: To change horizontal type to vertical and vice versa,
click the orientation icon, labeled in the figure. This feature works
best on single lines of type; if you swap the orientation of a text
box, the type is likely to get jumbled.
• Position: To relocate the text, move your cursor outside the text
box or, if you clicked to create a single line of text, away from that
line until the cursor changes into the Move cursor, as shown in
Figure 8-4. Then you can drag the text to a new position. For more
ways to reposition text, see the next section.
11. When you finish typing, click the green Accept check mark on the
options bar.
I labeled the check mark in Figure 8-4. If you instead want to escape out
of the text-creating process, click the Cancel button.

Notice that as soon as you start to create
text, Elements creates a new layer to hold
your words. After you click the Accept
check mark in Step 11, the layer name
changes to reflect the first few words in
the text, as shown in Figure 8-5. If you
create additional text, you get another
text layer. 
Editing text
You alter existing text in Elements differ-
ently depending on whether you want to
change all the text or just selected letters.
By “all” the text, I mean everything that’s
on the current text layer.
Either way, your first step is to click the
text layer in the Layers palette. Then use
these editing techniques:
 Change the formatting of an entire text layer: Select the Type tool but
don’t click with the tool. As soon as you select the tool, the options bar
changes to give you the controls shown in Figure 8-6. Any settings you
select from those controls affect the entire text layer. In addition to the
standard formatting options (font, size, and so on), you get a new con-
trol, Style, near the right end of the options bar. This control is your
ticket to special effects; see the upcoming section, “Creating text
effects,” for details. 
Enlarging characters on a text layer doesn’t damage picture quality, by
the way. To find out why, see the upcoming sidebar “Pixels versus vec-
tors, and why you should care.”
 Move all text on the current layer: Select the Move tool, labeled in
Figure 8-7, and then use the techniques discussed in Chapter 7 to relo-
cate the text. With respect to the Move tool, a text layer operates like
any other image layer.
 Remove a text layer: Drag the layer to the Trash icon in the Layers
palette. Again, see Chapter 7 for details on this layer operation.
 Alter only selected words or characters: Select the Horizontal or
Vertical Type tool (depending on which one you used to create the text)
and click in the line or text box that you want to edit. Then select the
characters that you want to change by dragging over them. A highlight
appears over the selected text, as shown in Figure 8-7.

You can’t add special effects via the Style control shown in Figure 8-5 to
just a portion of a text layer. If you want different effects for different
words, create the words separately so that they wind up on individual
layers.
Bending, distorting, and rotating text
You don’t have to stick with
plain ol’ horizontal or vertical
text; you can bend, distort, and
rotate your words to suit your
photo, as I did in Figure 8-8.
You can use a few different con-
trols to manipulate your type in
this way:
 Rotate text: Click the text
layer in the Layers palette
and then choose any of the
commands in the middle
of the Image➪Rotate sub-
menu. (Be sure to choose
a command that has the
word layer in its name.) For
details on the Free Rotate
command, see Chapter 7.
 Bend and warp text:
Click the text layer in the
Layers palette, select the
Horizontal or Vertical Type
tool, and then click the
Warp Text button on the
options bar, labeled in Figure 8-9. You then see the Warp Text dialog box,
also shown in the figure. Select a basic warp shape from the Style drop-
down list and then drag the sliders to customize the effect. Note that
you can’t warp just selected characters in a text box or line.

Creating text effects
In Elements, you can create a virtually endless variety of text effects via the
Style control on the options bar. I used this feature to create the effects
shown in Figures 8-1 and 8-8.
Note, though, that you can apply effects only to all characters on a text layer.
So if you want to give different looks to different words, create each text
object separately. Also, the effects aren’t available until after you create your
text as spelled out in the earlier section, “Creating basic text.”
Here’s how to explore and apply the available effects:
1. In the Layers palette, select the text layer by clicking it.
2. Select a Type tool but don’t click in your image.
You then see the options bar controls shown earlier in Figure 8-5. The
Style control, featured in Figure 8-10, resides at the far right end of the
options bar.
3. Click the Style button to open a palette that shows thumbnails of avail-
able effects, as shown in Figure 8-10.
Warp Text icon

Figure 8-10: Access text effects via the Style control on the options bar.
4. Click the arrowhead labeled in Figure 8-10 to display a palette menu
and choose a category of effects.
After you select a category, the thumbnails in the palette update to show
you the available effects.
5. Click the thumbnail of the effect you want to apply.
If you don’t like the result, choose Edit➪Undo. Or move on to Step 6 to
find out how to modify the effect.
6. To modify an effect, double-click the Effects icon in the Layers palette.
The Effects icon in Elements 5.0, labeled in Figure 8-11, appears as soon
as you apply an effect from the Style palette. In version 4.0, the icon
looks like the letters fx (for effects). When you double-click the icon, you
see a box that enables you to adjust various characteristics of the effect,
as shown in Figure 8-11. (The available controls depend on the initial
effect, and again, the dialog box design is slightly different in Elements 4.0
than what you see in the figure.) Click OK to close the dialog box when
you’re happy with the result.

If you later decide to remove all effects from a text layer, open the Style
palette menu as indicated in Figure 8-10 and then choose Remove Style.
Preserving text
If you choose certain commands or try to use certain tools on a type layer,
Elements may ask permission to simplify the layer. This converts your text
from a vector object to a pixel-based object, the ramifications of which are
spelled out in the sidebar titled “Vectors versus pixels, and why you should
care.” Be sure that you’re really ready to make the shift to the pixel lane
before you take that step.
Additionally, when you save your photo, be sure to use either the TIFF or PSD
file format and enable the Layers option in the Save As dialog box. Otherwise,
not only do your vectors turn into pixels, the type pixels and image pixels are
forever fused.
Effects icon

Casting Shadows
When you layer images, as I did with the two-photo pumpkin composition in
Figure 8-12, adding a shadow behind the top photo can help set it apart from
its background.
Most photo programs offer a shadow special effect, making this an easy
enhancement to apply. In Elements, take these steps to cast a shadow behind
the contents of an image layer:
1. Display the Layers palette and the Artwork and Effects palette.
In Elements 4.0, the second palette is named Styles and Effects. In either
version, you access the palettes via the Window menu.
2. In the Layers palette, click the layer to which you want to add the
shadow.
217
Chapter 8: Finishing Touches
Vectors versus pixels, and why you should care
Digital art comes in two forms: vector-based
objects and raster objects. A vector object is
made up of lines and curves that can be defined
by mathematical equations. Raster objects are
created out of pixels, those square tiles that
make up your digital photos.
The most important point to remember about
these two digital life forms is that you can
enlarge vector objects indefinitely with no
reduction in picture quality. Enlarging a photo or
other pixel-based being degrades the image, as
illustrated in Chapter 2.
I bring up this tedious technical fact because
most photo-editing programs actually incorpo-
rate both types of graphics. Photographs, of
course, are pixel-based. But most Text tools and
Shape tools (used for creating simple shapes)
typically create vector objects. Clip-art embell-
ishments usually are vector based as well.
The two types of objects, however, exist
together only inside your photo program and
only if you save your file in the program’s own
format (PSD, in Elements). Some programs also
offer a special flavor of the TIFF format that can
retain both vectors and pixels independently.
Either way, you must also turn on the file-saving
option that retains image layers. If you save in
another format or without enabling layers, not
only do vectors become pixels, but all the image
layers are fused together.
In some programs, including Elements, you can
also convert vector objects into pixel objects by
choosing Layer➪Simplify Layer. Why would you
do so? Because some Elements editing com-
mands aren’t available for vector objects. The
downside of simplifying vector objects is that
you can no longer adjust their color, shape, and
so on as easily as you can when they’re in the
vector state.

218
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
You must apply the shadow to the entire layer; you can’t cast a shadow
behind only selected areas on a layer.
3. In the Artwork and Effects palette, click the Special Effects icon,
labeled in Figure 8-12.
In Elements 4.0, you can skip this step.
4. Select Layer Styles and Drop Shadows from the drop-down lists in the
palette, as shown in the figure.
The palette then displays icons representing several styles of drop
shadows.
5. Click one of the shadow icons and then click the Apply button at the
bottom of the palette.
Select the shadow icon that looks closest to the effect that you want to
create; you can fine-tune the result later. As soon as you choose an icon,
the shadow appears in the image.
6. To adjust the shadow effect, double-click the Effects icon in the Layers
palette.
The icon appears to the right of the layer name.

In Elements 4.0, choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer Style. Note that the
command removes all styles currently applied to the layer; you can’t remove
individual styles in Elements 4.0.
Adding a Border
To add a solid-colored border around a picture, as shown in Figure 8-13,
follow these steps:
Figure 8-13: Use the Stroke command to add a border inside the existing image boundaries.
1. Select the entire photo by choosing Select➪All.
2. Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection to display the dialog box
shown in Figure 8-13.
3. Enter the border size in the Width box.
Be sure to include the unit of measurement — pixels, inches,
whatever — as shown in the figure.
4. Click the Color box to open the Color Picker and set the border 
color.
Chapter 7 provides details about the Color Picker if you need help.
219
Chapter 8: Finishing Touches

220
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
5. Select the Inside option in the Location area of the dialog box.
You can stroke a selection — that is, paint a solid line along the selection
outline — in three ways in Elements. You can put the line entirely inside
the outline, center it on the outline, or position it outside the outline.
But the Center and Outside options work only if you select just a portion
of your photo in Step 1. When you select the entire image, there’s
nowhere for Elements to put the border pixels except inside the selec-
tion outline. If you select Center, you simply get a border that’s half as
thick as you specify in the Width box.
6. Set the Blending Mode control to Normal and the Opacity value
to 100%.
These are the default values, so you’re probably already good to go.
7. Click OK to close the dialog box and apply the border.
8. Choose Select➪Deselect to get rid of your selection outline.
If you want to add a border outside your existing image area, follow the
Chapter 7 instructions for increasing the image canvas size. When you
enlarge the canvas, set the canvas extension color to the color of the border
you want to create. Remember, though, that this technique enlarges the over-
all dimensions of your image. In this case, the enlargement doesn’t affect
your photo quality because you’re not altering the photo itself, just adding
some solid-colored pixels.
Here’s one more tip about borders: For extra flexibility, you can create a new
layer before you take Step 1. Putting your border on a separate layer enables
you to more easily adjust the border down the road. You can change its color
by applying the Hue/Saturation filter (see Chapter 7 for how-to’s). You also
can apply special effects to create faux frames such as the one featured later
in this chapter, in Figure 8-16. 
Creating a Vignette Effect
Many consumer-level photo programs offer a special effect that creates the
“fading frame” look you see in Figure 8-14 — known as a vignette, in official
photo lingo. But because the available vignette effects can be limiting in
terms of the softness of the frame edge or the size of the frame opening, the
following steps show you how to create your own custom vignette frames.
All you need is a rectangular or oval selection tool that offers the option
of creating a feathered (or fading) selection outline, which is found in most
photo programs.

Figure 8-14: This soft vignette effect takes only seconds to create.
Here’s how I create this effect in Elements:
1. Create a new image that is either larger than or the same size as your
photo.
Use the File➪New➪Blank File command, which I detail in Chapter 7. Set
the Resolution (ppi) option in the New dialog box to match that of your
photo. Set the photo dimensions to the final print or display size you
have in mind and set the Background Contents option to white.
2. Open your photo and then copy and paste it into the new image.
Again, Chapter 7 spells out how to complete this step. But here’s the
quickest option: Select the Move tool and then drag the photo into the
new image.
If you open the Layers palette (Window➪Layers), you should see that
your photo now rests on its own layer atop the white Background layer
of the new image. You can close the original photo image if you want.
3. Select the Rectangular Marquee or Elliptical Marquee tool from the
toolbox.
These two tools share a slot near the top of the toolbox, labeled in
Figure 8-15. Choose the Rectangular Marquee tool if you want a rectangu-
lar or square vignetted frame like the one in my example image; choose
the Elliptical Marquee for an oval or circular frame.
221
Chapter 8: Finishing Touches

222
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
Figure 8-15: A feathered selection outline is the secret to the vignette treatment.
4. On the options bar, set the Mode to Normal and be sure that the New
Selection icon is selected, as shown in Figure 8-15.
Or, if you want to create a circular or square frame, set the Mode control
to Fixed Aspect Ratio and enter 1 into both the Width and Height boxes.
(The boxes become available after you change the Mode setting.)
5. Enter a Feather value other than 0.
The higher the value, the more gradually the vignette effect will fade at
the edges and the more the effect will eat away the perimeter of the
photo. Usually, a value between about 5 and 20 works well, depending
on the size of your photo. Finding the right value takes some experimen-
tation, so just enter a guesstimate for now.
For more information about feathering and other Marquee tool options,
watch the QuickTime movie titled “Selection Basics,” found on the DVD
included with this book.

6. If you’re using the Elliptical Marquee, enable the Anti-alias feature on
the options bar.
This option smooths any jagged edges that can otherwise occur around
the edges of the selection outline that you’re about to create.
7. Drag to create a selection outline around the portion of the photo that
you want to frame.
When you release your mouse button, the dotted outline represents
your selection outline, as shown in Figure 8-15. The outline isn’t accurate
in terms of how much feathering will result, however, so don’t pay any
attention to that aspect of the outline.
If you don’t get the outline just right, either start over and try again or
use these tricks to refine the outline:
• Move the outline. Put your cursor inside the outline and drag. Or
press the arrow keys on your keyboard to nudge the outline into
place.
• Enlarge the outline. Choose Select➪Modify➪Expand and then
specify how many pixels you want to add to the outline in the
resulting dialog box.
• Shrink the outline. Choose Select➪Modify➪Contract and specify
how much you want to reduce the outline size, in pixels.
8. Choose Select➪Inverse to reverse the selection outline.
This command swaps the selection outline so that whatever was previ-
ously selected becomes not selected, and vice versa. So your photo back-
ground is now selected instead of the photo area that you want to keep.
Why not just select the background in the first place? Because no selec-
tion tool automatically creates an outline in the shape needed for this
project — the space outside the rectangular or elliptical area of the pic-
ture. When approaching selecting, always select the area that’s easiest to
tackle first, knowing that you can inverse the resulting outline if needed.
9. Press Delete to erase the selected background area.
The remaining photo area now fades out according to the shape of the
outline that you created.
If the edges of the vignette aren’t to your liking, choose Edit➪Undo and
try again using a different Feathering value.
10. If desired, fill the Background layer with color or a pattern.
Ah, now it may become clear to you why I suggest the two-layer approach
to this effect. Because your photo floats above the Background layer,
you’re free to fill that Background layer with a solid color, texture, or 
anything else that comes to mind. I filled the layer with a soft yellow to
produce the image in Figure 8-14. Chapter 7 provides details on this step.
See the sections related to filling the image canvas.
223
Chapter 8: Finishing Touches

224
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
11. When you’re happy with the effect, merge the photo and background
layer by choosing Layer➪Flatten Layers.
Don’t take this step if you think you may want to alter the background
later. After you merge the two layers, you can’t easily change the color
or texture of the background.
Placing a Photo in a Digital Frame
By combining the border technique explored earlier with some techniques
covered in Chapter 7, you can create a faux matte and frame effect like the
one shown in Figure 8-16. This effect is a great solution if you need a print
that has proportions different from those of your photo. For example, sup-
pose that you cropped a photo to a size of 4 x 4 inches. But you want to
frame the picture in a standard, 11 x 14-inch frame, behind a matte that
has an 8 x 10-inch opening for a photo. You can surround your image with a
“digital matte” to fill out the rest of that 8 x 10-inch opening.
Figure 8-16: Adding the digital matte around the photo enabled me to put the picture in a 
standard rectangular frame.

The following steps show you how to create the effect shown in the figure.
After you build this matte, you can use the same basic recipe to create count-
less variations on the idea.
1. Create a new canvas by choosing File➪New➪Blank File.
Set the canvas size to match the final print dimensions and resolution
(ppi) you have in mind. Chapter 7 has details if you need help. 
2. Fill the canvas with color and texture as explained in Chapter 7.
Keep the texture and color subtle, so that they don’t visually overwhelm
the photo.
3. Copy and paste your photo into the new canvas.
Again, Chapter 7 explains this process, but here’s a quick recap: Just open
the photo and then use the Move tool to drag it into the new canvas.
4. Open the Layers palette and create a new image layer above the
photo layer.
To do so, first make sure that the photo layer is highlighted in the
palette. (If not, click the layer name.) Then click the New Layer icon,
labeled in Figure 8-17.
The new layer will hold the frame effect that you’re about to create.
Figure 8-17: After creating a border on the top layer, I applied a special effect to 
create the illusion of a metal frame.

Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
5. Hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) as you click the thumbnail that
represents your photo layer in the Layers palette.
This trick creates a selection outline that encompasses the contents of
the photo layer — which becomes the basis for your border in the next
step. Note that you aren’t selecting the photo layer itself; you’re simply
creating a selection outline based on that layer’s contents. The new
layer you created in Step 4 is still the active layer, or should be. If that
layer isn’t highlighted in the palette, click it in the palette.
6. Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection and add a simple border.
See the earlier section, “Adding a Border,” for details about the options
inside the Stroke dialog box that appears. Set the border size to match
the thickness of the frame you want to create. In this case, you can posi-
tion the border inside, outside, or centered on your selection outline, so
choose which option works best for your photo. 
7. Choose Select➪Deselect to get rid of the selection outline.
8. Decorate the border with a special effect.
In Elements 5.0, choose Window➪Artwork and Effects to display the
palette shown on the right in Figure 8-17. Click the Special Effects icon at
the top of the palette (it’s just to the left of the T icon). In Elements 4.0,
choose Window➪Styles and Effects to display a similar palette.
In both versions, select Layer Styles from the left drop-down list, select
an effects category from the right drop-down list, and then click one of
the specific effects icons that appear. Click the Apply button to add the
effect to the border. I selected an effect from the Wow Chrome category
to create the frame effect you see in Figure 8-16.
If you don’t like the results of the effect, choose Edit➪Undo and try
again. Or tweak the effect as explained in Step 8.
9. To adjust the effect, double-click the Effects icon for the border layer
in the Layers palette.
The icon appears to the left of the layer name in the palette. You also
can choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Style Settings. This opens the Style
Settings dialog box, where you can control many different characteris-
tics of the effect. Click OK to close the dialog box after you’re satisfied
with your creation.
10. Save the image in the PSD (Photoshop) or TIFF format, with the Layers
box enabled.
This step preserves your image with independent layers so that you can
easily change the matte color and texture as well as the frame effect at any
time. If you need a flattened image — that is, one with all the layers merged
together — either disable the Layers box or save in a format that doesn’t
support layers, such as JPEG. But save this flattened image under a dif-
ferent name so that you don’t overwrite your original, layered version.

Creating Black-and-White Photos
Converting a color photo to black
and white can dramatically change
the impact of the subject. Consider
the color portrait in Figure 8-18, for
example. It’s nice enough, but the
blue background really draws the
eye away from the model, who
should be the primary point of
interest. Removing the color dimin-
ishes the prominence of the back-
ground and redirects the eye to the
subject’s face.
Before I show you how to make
this conversion, I need to point
out one bit of imaging terminology:
Technically speaking, what most
people refer to as a black-and-white
photo is called a grayscale image in
the world of digital imaging. A true
black-and-white image can contain
only black and white, with no
shades of gray.
In addition, you need to know about
an official color mode called the
Grayscale mode. This type of image
can contain just 256 colors —
black, white, and shades of gray
in between. But in Elements and in
many other programs, you can
suck the color out of a photo —
desaturate the image, in other
words — but leave the picture 
in the RGB, or full color mode.
(Remember, RGB stands for red-
green-blue, the primary colors in a
digital image.)
227
Chapter 8: Finishing Touches
Figure 8-18: Converting the color image to
grayscale restores emphasis to the subject’s
face.

228
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
This distinction is important for two reasons:
 If you’re asked to submit a black-and-white photo to a publication, you
most likely need to send the image in the official Grayscale mode. (Ask
the publication designer for guidance.) 
 If you leave the picture in the RGB mode, you can add new color ele-
ments to the photo. For example, you can add red text on top of your
black-and-white photo, or you can paint with color atop the image to
create the look of a hand-tinted image.
With those bits of business out of the way, use these techniques to convert
your image:
 To convert the photo to grayscale but keep it in the RGB color
mode: The fastest option is to choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Remove Color. But this command doesn’t give you any input into
how the conversion is made. So in version 5.0, Elements also provides
the Enhance➪Convert to Black and White command, which provides
you with the more sophisticated conversion controls shown in
Figure 8-19. Start by selecting a basic photo type from the Select a Style
list. Then fine tune the results by clicking the thumbnails to the right.
Drag the Adjustment Intensity slider to control how much change you
get from each click of a thumbnail.
If you have trouble getting the look you want, remember that you can
always apply the Levels filter to tweak image brightness and contrast
after you make the conversion. In fact, you’re probably better off adjust-
ing contrast with that filter than with the contrast controls provided
with the Convert to Black and White dialog box. Chapter 4 covers the
Levels filter.
 To convert to the Grayscale color mode: Choose Image➪Mode➪
Grayscale. Elements may ask permission to dump the image colors;
click OK to proceed. If you later change your mind and want to add
colored text or some other color element to the photo, just choose
Image➪Mode➪RGB Color. Doing so does not bring back your original
image colors; it simply allows you to add new colors.
Always save your converted image under a new name from the original in
case you ever need the full-color version again.

Figure 8-19: Elements 5 offers a new tool that offers more control over color to grayscale
conversions. 
Creating a Sepia-Toned Image
A so-called sepia tone (tint) such as the one you see in Figure 8-20 is another
nice portrait effect. You can easily go from a full-color original to this result in
Elements; the secret lies in the Hue/Saturation dialog box, also shown in the
figure.
To access the dialog box, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/
Saturation. Inside the dialog box, select the Colorize box. After you do so,
your original colors disappear, and you get a tinted image. Drag the Hue
slider to adjust the tint color; use the Saturation slider to adjust the intensity
of the tint. If you need to adjust overall image brightness and contrast, how-
ever, I suggest that you bypass the Lightness slider in this dialog box and
instead work with the exposure filters covered in Chapter 4.
229
Chapter 8: Finishing Touches

230
Part III: Beyond the Frame: Project Idea Kit 
Figure 8-20: Enable the Colorize box and then drag the Hue slider to adjust the tint color.
Note that this technique works only on images that are in the RGB color mode.
If your image is in the Grayscale color mode, choose Image➪Mode➪RGB to
send the photo to the RGB color planet. (See the preceding section for an
explanation of the Grayscale mode.) You then can create your tint by using
the Hue/Saturation filter.
Playing with Artistic Effects
Without a doubt, the most entertaining (and addictive) way to spend time
with your digital photos is to play with the special effects filters offered by
most photo-editing programs. With just a click or two, you can make your
photo look as though it was created with watercolors, pastels, or about any
other traditional art media you can imagine. You also can add wacky special
effects that have no real-life equivalents.
As fun as they are, however, special effects also have a practical use. If your
photo suffers from irreparable focus problems or other serious issues, a spe-
cial effects filter can disguise the defects. The example in Figure 8-21 is a case
in point. Despite my best efforts, the retouched scan (left) of an old color slide
remains pretty softly focused. In addition, the image is a little grainy — the
original slide was very dark, and brightening it brought forth that unfortunate
side effect — and the background isn’t what you would call exactly appealing.
Applying a watercolor effects filter softened the background elements, and

the grain and focus problems are hidden by the “brushstrokes” of the paint.
This, in the computer biz, is called “turning a bug into a feature.”
Figure 8-21: Adding a watercolor filter to this photo gave it a softer, more artistic look.
Every photo program that I’ve seen offers a good selection of artistic filters,
so check the Help system or manual to find out how to access them. In
Elements, you select the effects filters from the Filter menu. After you choose
an effect, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 8-22, where you can adjust
various aspects of your selected effect. You can monitor your changes in the
preview pane on the left side of the dialog box; use the controls at the bottom
of the preview to zoom and scroll the display. If you don’t like the effect, just
choose a different one from the pane in the middle of the dialog box.
For even greater creative control, apply the effects filter to a duplicate of
your original Background layer. Open the Layers palette and then drag the
Background layer to the New Layer icon (refer to Figure 8-17). Apply the
effect to the duplicate layer. Then you can adjust the impact of the effect by
changing the Opacity value for the layer in the Layers palette. You also can
mix the filtered layer with the original layer in new ways by playing with the
layer blending mode in the palette. (The Blending Mode control is the drop-
down list to the left of the Opacity control.)

Help potential clients put a face with a name by adding your picture to your
business card, as shown in Figure 9-1. You can take your finished design to
any quick-print shop for reproduction on business-card paper stock.
Figure 9-1: Adding a photo to your business card makes it easier for people to 
remember you.
I created the card in Figure 9-1 in Photoshop Elements, but the basic steps
are the same in any photo program:
1. Create a new image file and set the image dimensions to business-card
size (2 x 3.5 inches is standard).

In Elements, choose File➪New➪Blank File. Set the Width and Height
values to 2 x 3.5 inches or vice versa, depending on how you want to
orient the card. Set the image resolution to 300 ppi and set the
Background Contents option to white. (Chapter 7 provides details
about the Blank File command; see the section about creating an
image canvas.)
2. Open your photo and crop and retouch it as needed.
3. Copy the photo into the new image you created in Step 1.
If you place the two image windows side by side, you can use the Move
tool to drag the photo into the blank image. (Again, Chapter 7 shows
you how.)
4. Follow the instructions in Chapter 8 to add the text to the card.
It’s best to create each line of text separately rather than putting it all in
a single text box. Having single lines makes positioning the text elements
easier.
5. Use the Shape tools to add lines, boxes, or bullets.
The Shape tools share a flyout menu near the bottom of the toolbox, as
shown in Figure 9-2. I used the Line tool to add the horizontal rule (line)
to the business card. You simply drag with the tool to create the shape,
setting the shape formatting with the controls on the options bar. (For
bullets, try using the Ellipse tool.)
Shapes appear on their own layers and work similarly to text layers,
explained in Chapter 8. You can find specifics in the Elements Help
system. (Choose Help➪Photoshop Elements Help.)
6. When you’re finished with the card, choose File➪Save As and save a
layered version of your file.
You must select either the PSD or TIFF format and enable the Layers
check box in the Save As dialog box. By retaining your individual
layers, you can easily alter the text or replace the photo in the future
if needed.
Chapter 3 discusses these and other details of saving files.
7. Create a single-layer version of the file to take to the copy shop for
reproduction.
With the original file open, choose File➪Save As. Give the file a new
name and then save it in the TIFF format with the Layers option disabled.
This creates a flattened (single-layer) copy of the image file that you can
take to your quick-print shop for reproduction. (Check with the shop
first to find out about any special file-prep requirements.)

Add Pictures to a Text Document
Chapter 8 shows you how to add captions and other bits of text to an image
in Photoshop Elements. But the text tools found in Elements and other photo-
editing programs aren’t very sophisticated, so if your project calls for more
than a line or two of type, you’re better off creating it in a word-processing
program such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect. After you enter and
edit your text, you can then add a photo to the page, as I did for my profes-
sional bio, a portion of which appears in Figure 9-3.

Figure 9-3: You can insert digital photos into any text document.
The following steps show you how to insert a picture into a Microsoft Word
document. Note that as I write this, Microsoft is introducing a new version of
the program (Word 2007). The basic steps for inserting pictures are the same,
but the way you access the controls varies. The figures and steps here relate
to earlier versions of Word, but I added notes within the steps to point you in
the right direction if you use the new version. If you use some other word
processing program, the basic process is the same, too, but check your soft-
ware’s Help system for specific command names and formatting options.
1. In your document, click the spot where you want to insert the picture.
2. Choose Insert➪Picture➪From File.
In Word 2007, click the Insert tab and then click the Picture icon. Either
way, you then see a variation of the standard file-opening dialog box.
3. Locate and select the picture you want to use and then click Insert.
Your picture appears in your document.

4. Click the picture to select it and then choose Format➪Picture to set
the initial formatting options for the picture.
You see the Format
Picture dialog box,
shown in Figure 9-4. 
You can skip this
step in Word 2007;
the Format tab
should pop into view
as soon as you insert
your picture. (If not,
click the tab.) All the
options for format-
ting your picture
appear on the tab, so
you can skip Steps 5
and 6 also.
5. Click the Layout tab
and set the Wrapping
Style option. 
This setting deter-
mines text wrapping,
which affects how
the program positions your photo with respect to the text.
6. Visit the other tabs of the dialog box to continue formatting your text
and then click OK to close the dialog box.
In addition to formatting text through the dialog box, you can click the pic-
ture to display little boxes around its perimeter, as shown earlier around the
picture in Figure 9-3. Your picture is now selected, and you can manipulate it
as follows:
 To move the picture, click and drag it.
 To resize the photo, drag a corner handle. Remember that enlarging the
photo significantly can reduce image quality.
In Word 2007, other controls for adjusting your picture appear on the Format
tab. In earlier versions, you can access other controls via the Picture toolbar,
labeled in Figure 9-3. To display the toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars➪Picture.
For details on the toolbar controls as well as other aspects of working with
graphics in Microsoft Word, check the program’s Help system.
Figure 9-4: Options on the Layout tab control how text flows
around the picture.

These same steps work for adding pictures to documents that you create in
other Microsoft Office programs, including Excel and PowerPoint.
Turn a Portrait into a Coloring Book Page
Here’s a fun project to do with children: Photograph your subject against a
white backdrop, as shown in the left image in Figure 9-5. Then turn the photo
into a coloring book page by applying a special-effects filter in your photo
editor, as shown on the right.

To create the effect in Elements, follow these steps:
1. Press D to set the foreground paint color to black.
The D stands for default colors — black for the foreground paint color
and white for the background paint color.
2. Choose Filter➪Sketch➪Photocopy.
The dialog box shown in Figure 9-6 appears. 
3. Adjust the sliders on the right side of the dialog box to produce an
outline effect you like. Then click OK to close the dialog box.
4. If needed, use the Eraser tool to clean up the image.
When used on the Background layer, the Eraser tool applies the back-
ground paint color, which you set to white in Step 1. On the options bar,
set the tool mode to Brush and the Opacity to 100% and then drag to
erase any lines that you don’t want in your coloring-book image.
If a large portion of the background needs help, select it by using the
selection tools, introduced in Chapter 4. Then just press Delete to make
the selected area white.
5. Print the image on white paper.
See Chapter 3 to find out how to establish the print size and resolution
before you print.
Figure 9-6: The Photocopy filter creates a black-and-white outline of your image.

As a variation on the theme, you can create a watercolor page by printing the
image on watercolor paper, assuming that you own an inkjet printer that can
accept such specialty papers.
Shoot and Stitch a Panoramic Image
Can’t get your entire subject to fit in the frame, even if you use your camera’s
widest-angle setting? Record the scene in pieces and then stitch them together
in your photo editor to create a panoramic image. For example, because of the
location of the house shown in Figure 9-7, I wasn’t able to move far enough
away to capture it all in one shot. So I shot two images, capturing different
portions of the house, and then fused the images into the panoramic version
shown in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-7: Frame the segments of your panorama so that they overlap by at least 30%.
Figure 9-8: The stitched panorama appears to be a single image.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Most photo programs offer a tool that automates the process of stitching
multiple photos into a panorama. In Elements, just open the photos that you
want to seam and then choose File➪New➪Photomerge Panorama. You then
see a dialog box that contains a preview of the stitched image, as shown in
Figure 9-9. You can use the dialog box controls to tweak the stitching job if
needed.
Figure 9-9: A panorama-stitcher simplifies the job of seaming multiple images.
For the most part, automated panorama stitching programs work very well
and are easy to use if — and this is a big if — you shoot your original pictures
correctly. Follow these guidelines:
 Maintain the correct axis of rotation as you pan the camera. When you
pan (rotate) the camera to shoot each piece of the panorama, keep the
optical center of the lens on the same axis of rotation, as shown in the

left illustration in Figure 9-10. Contrary to what you may expect, putting
the camera on a tripod isn’t a good solution. The center stem of the
tripod then becomes the axis of rotation, and when you mount most
cameras on a tripod, the lens is positioned in front of that axis of rota-
tion, as shown in the right illustration in the figure.
You can buy fancy (and expensive) panoramic tripod heads that solve
this problem, but an easier option is just to align the lens visually with
some stationary point. For example, have a friend hold up a finger and
align the lens so that it is directly above that finger for each shot. Or
place a quarter or some other small marker on the ground and use that
as your axis reference marker.
Note that although this trick should alleviate major stitching problems,
it’s still pretty crude. The steps involved in precise positioning are too
complex to cover here, but you can find good tutorials online if you’re
interested. Just use Google or your favorite Web search tool to look for
sites that discuss panorama nodal points.
 Keep the camera on the same level for each shot. If you’re shooting a
landscape, for example, make sure that the horizon line appears at the
same position in each frame.
Figure 9-10: Keep the lens centered on the same axis of rotation for each shot.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 Maintain the same focus distance, aperture, and exposure for each
frame. Otherwise, visible breaks may appear in your stitched photo due
to shifts in depth of field (zone of sharp focus) and changes in the
brightness of areas found in both frames — the sky, for example. This
shooting dilemma is tricky if you shoot in fully automatic mode because
the camera may choose different focus points, f-stops, and exposure set-
tings for each frame, especially if one part of the scene is brightly lit and
another is in the shadows. If possible, switch to manual mode so that
you can use the same settings for every frame. Some cameras also offer
a feature that enables you to lock in a particular autoexposure setting.
As a workaround for getting the job done in automatic mode, pick one
object that is of average brightness and distance and set the focus and
exposure on that same area for each frame. Remember, you can lock in
focus and exposure in auto mode by pressing and holding the shutter
button halfway down. While continuing to hold the button halfway,
reframe the picture to take the shot.
 Overlap each shot by at least 30 percent. For example, in my
panorama, both original images include the front porch area and a por-
tion of the garage. This overlap gives the stitching program reference
points that it needs to assemble the images correctly.
 Watch out for people moving through the scene. If people are walking
through the area you’re shooting, be sure that each person appears only
in a single frame. Otherwise, when you stitch the photos, you may wind
up with the same person appearing multiple times in the image. Ditto for
cars, boats, and other moving vehicles.
If you follow these guidelines, your stitching program should be able to pro-
duce a seamless composite with very little trouble. Because each program
works a little differently, check your software’s Help system or user manual to
find out exactly how to use the stitching function if you don’t work with
Elements.
Change the Color of an Object
Suppose that you have a product shot that features, say, a blue background,
like the one on the right in Figure 9-11. But then for some reason, you need a
differently colored background — perhaps the image is going on a Web page,
and your original background clashes with the page background, or you just
decide on another color scheme for aesthetic reasons.

Figure 9-11: To change the background, I selected it and filled it with a new color in my photo-editing
program.
You can make this change easily in
most photo editors. Here’s the most
efficient way:
1. Select the area that you want
to change.
Chapter 4 shows you how to
create a selection outline if you
need help.
2. Open the Layers palette
(Window➪Layers) and create a
new, empty layer.
Just click the New Layer icon,
shown in Figure 9-12.
3. Select Color from the Layer
palette’s Blending Mode con-
trol, labeled in Figure 9-12.

Chapter 9: Ten More Projects for Home and Office

Blending Mode control
Figure 9-12: The Color blending mode is the
secret to realistic color changes.

248
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
4. Fill the selected area with paint.
The quickest way to fill the selection with your new color is to choose
Edit➪Fill Selection, which opens the Fill Layer dialog box. Inside the
dialog box, choose Color from the Use drop-down list to open the Color
Picker and select your paint color. Click OK to close the Color Picker and
click OK again to close the Fill Layer dialog box. (Chapter 7 details this
process; see the section related to changing the canvas color.)
Keep in mind that after you paint, you can adjust the opacity of the paint if
needed by using the Opacity control in the Layers palette. And you can
easily experiment with other paint colors by using the Hue/Saturation
filter as explained in the aforementioned section of Chapter 7.
5. Merge the paint layer with the underlying image by choosing
Layer➪Flatten Image.
Unfortunately, when you use the Color blending mode, pixels that are com-
pletely white or black don’t change. If you need to recolor black or white
pixels, follow the same steps but set the Blending Mode control to Normal.
Then lower the layer opacity (by using the Opacity control in the Layers
palette) as needed to produce the results you want.
Create a Web Photo Gallery
Have a bunch of photos that you’d like to share online with friends and
family? Don’t waste your time (and that of your recipients) by attaching the
images one by one to an e-mail message. Instead, create an online gallery of
your photos.
You can create and post a gallery in several ways:
 Join a free online photo-sharing site such as Kodak Gallery (www.
kodakgallery.com) or Snapfish (www.snapfish.com). You use the site’s
software to upload your images and arrange them into albums. Then you
can send e-mail invites to everyone you want to be able to view the
photos. Visitors can order prints of their favorite images — saving you
the time and expense of doing so.
Note that most sites that provide free photo sharing require that you
buy a print or some other photo product during the year. If you don’t,
your pictures are usually deleted.

 Purchase a membership in an album site such as Phanfare, at www.
phanfare.com. (A one-year membership to Phanfare is currently about
$55.) The advantage to a paid site is that you usually get more storage
space for your pictures, which means that you can upload full-resolution
pictures to your gallery, an option not available on all free sites. If you
need a convenient way to get high-resolution photos to clients or col-
leagues, this type of site is a great option. Paid sites also aren’t cluttered
with the advertising common on free sites.
 If you have a Web site or have access to free pages via your Internet
provider, you can create your own custom image gallery. Most photo-
editing programs offer templates for creating galleries; Figure 9-13 shows
a look at a screen found in the gallery-maker in Photoshop Elements.
To get started in that program, choose File➪Create➪Photo Galleries.
In Elements 4.0, the command is slightly different: File➪Create➪HTML
Photo Gallery. The dialog box was also redesigned in version 5.0, but the
basic options are the same in both versions.
Figure 9-13: You can quickly turn a batch of pictures into an online gallery via automated tools 
such as the one in Elements.

Create a Slide-Show Screen Saver
When your computer is turned on but not in use, the monitor probably dis-
plays a screen saver, a series of graphics or images that move across the
screen. You can replace the prefab screen savers that ship with the Windows
and Mac operating systems with one that features your favorite images. The
next two sections give you the steps.
Putting together a screen saver in Windows XP
To create a screen saver in Windows XP, take these steps:
1. Put the images that you want to feature in the screensaver in a sepa-
rate folder.
If you don’t want to move the pictures out of their current folders for
organizational purposes, just make copies to use for the slide show.
Then put the copies in a new folder.
To really do the job correctly, you should resize all the photos to the res-
olution of your monitor, as explained in Chapter 3. Okay, so you don’t
absolutely have to — Windows will adjust the size of the pictures on the
fly in the screensaver — but you didn’t hear it from me.
2. Right-click an empty area of the Windows desktop and choose
Properties from the pop-up menu that appears.
You see the Display Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 9-14.
3. Click the Screen Saver tab to display the options shown in Figure 9-14.
4. Open the Screen Saver drop-down list and choose My Pictures
Slideshow.
5. Click the Settings button to open the dialog box shown in Figure 9-15.
6. Click the Browse button to open a second box from which you can
select the folder that contains the images you want to use in the slide
show.
Click OK to close the box after you choose the folder.
7. Adjust the other settings in the My Screen Saver Options dialog box
and then click OK to return to the Display Properties dialog box.
8. Select the Wait time and password option as desired and then click
Apply.
If you enable the password control, be sure to write down your pass-
word or choose one that’s easy to remember! If you forget the password,
you won’t be able to stop the screen saver to access your normal com-
puter functions.

Creating a photo screen saver on a Mac
If you use a Macintosh computer, follow these steps to create a slide-show
screen saver:
1. Open the System Preferences dialog box by choosing System
Preferences from the Apple menu.
2. Click the Show All icon and then click the Desktop and Screen Saver
icon to display the dialog box shown in Figure 9-16.
3. Click the Screen Saver button to display the options you see in
Figure 9-16.
4. From the Screen Savers list on the left side of the dialog box, choose
the folder that contains the images that you want to include in the
screen saver.
If the folder you want isn’t visible, click the Choose Folder option to
access additional folders on your system. Click Choose after you find the
folder you want to return to the dialog box shown in Figure 9-16.
5. Use the other controls in the dialog box to customize the screen saver
timing and display.
Figure 9-16: On a Mac, create your screen saver via the Desktop and Screen 
Saver panel of the System Preferences dialog box.

Blur Your Way to an Abstract Image
Want to give a collage or other photo
composition an interesting back-
ground? You can play around with
special effects filters or fill your
canvas with prefab patterns or tex-
tures (see Chapter 7), but here’s
another idea: First, find a colorful
object to photograph. Then, when
you take the picture, simply move
your camera slightly back and forth
during the exposure. The result will
be a blurry pattern featuring the
colors in the subject. I used this tech-
nique to create the pattern you see
on the bottom in Figure 9-17; the
image on the top shows a close-up of
the hand-painted plate that served as
my subject.
To achieve a significant blur, you
need a slow shutter speed. I used a
shutter speed of 1 second for my
image, for example. If your camera
doesn’t offer manual exposure or
shutter-priority exposure — meaning
you have no direct control over shut-
ter speed — try using Nighttime
scene mode, if that’s available, or check your camera manual to discover
other scene modes that may produce a slower shutter.
Of course, if you can’t produce the
extent of blur you like in camera, you
can increase the blur in your photo
editor. For example, I applied the
Radial Blur filter in Elements to the
original plate image to create the
variation shown in Figure 9-18.
To apply the filter, choose Filter➪
Blur➪Radial Blur. This particular
filter offers no real-time preview of
the resulting effect, so just experi-
ment until you get the look you like.
To create the effect in Figure 9-18,
I set the filter Amount slider to 100,
selected Spin as the Blur Method, and set the Quality option to Best.

while exposing the picture of the plate, I created
the cool abstract image on the bottom.

Print a Contact Sheet
A contact sheet, in photography lingo, is simply a page that contains thumbnails
of a batch of images. You can print a contact sheet that shows thumbnails of
all the photos that you copied onto a CD or DVD, for example. I take this step
every time I archive my images onto a CD, in fact, so that when I’m searching
for an image, I can just scan my contact sheets instead of loading CDs into my
CD drive.
Most photo-organizer programs offer a command that prints contact sheets.
In the Windows version of Elements, for example, you open the Organizer,
select the folder or images that you want to include on the contact sheet, and
then choose File➪Print. In the resulting dialog box, shown in Figure 9-19, select
Contact Sheet from the Select Type of Print drop-down list, as shown in the
figure. You can then specify various aspects of the contact sheet, including
the number of thumbnails per page and what data prints with each thumbnail.
The center of the dialog box shows a preview of the contact sheet.
Figure 9-19: You can print a contact sheet showing thumbnails of selected images.

If you use iPhoto, the free organizer provided with recent versions of the Mac
operating system, you create a contact sheet in much the same way. Select
the images to include on the sheet, click the Print button, and then select
Contact Sheet from the Style drop-down list in the resulting dialog box.
Creating One-of-a-Kind Photo Gifts
You probably already know that you can use your digital photos to create
custom greeting cards, calendars, and other standard print products. Most
photo programs offer templates that simplify the process, and, if you’re short
on time or energy, just about any quick-print shop, online print service, or
local photo lab can do the job for you.
You may not be aware, though, of some of the more unusual types of gifts
that you can create from your photos. Here are some of my favorites:
 Photo postage stamps: That’s right, you don’t have to be famous and dead
to get your picture on a postage stamp. One online company offering
this product is PhotoStamps (http://photo.stamps.com). Some digital-
print kiosks found in photo labs also enable you to produce your own
stamps. And, yes, the stamps are accepted as standard postage by the
post office.
 Notebook skins: A notebook skin is a self-sticking vinyl cover that you can
adhere to your laptop computer case — think grade-school book jacket
done up for the digital age. Companies such as Skinit (www.skinit.com)
enable you to upload a favorite photo and turn it into your own, per-
sonal notebook skin. You can also create skins for mobile phones, MP3
players, and other digital devices.
 Pillows and other home décor items: By printing your images on fabric
transfer paper, available for most inkjet printers, you can create pillows,
blankets, baby bibs, and any other type of fabric-based gift or decorator
item you can imagine. For example, I recently turned a collage of family
images into a “memory pillow” for my grandmother. The top image in
Figure 9-20 shows you the original collage, which I created using the
techniques spelled out in Chapter 7; the lower image shows the finished
project. Don’t sew? You can order a variety of similar items from most
photo labs and some scrapbooking stores.

Ten Steps to Better Digital Photos
In This Chapter
 Pressing the shutter button properly
 Taking advantage of creative scene modes
 Thinking differently about flash
 Paying attention to the background
 Composing your photo according to the rule of thirds
 Framing loosely to allow for flexible cropping and framing
 Using the right resolution, format, and ISO settings
 Avoiding “cheese-y” photos
 Saving edited photos in a lossless file format rather than JPEG
 Calibrating your computer monitor for better color accuracy
F
or most folks, getting started in digital photography is a
pretty confusing prospect. Even technically savvy
people spend a lot of time saying, “huh?” when they go
digital.
Earlier chapters of this book break down all the stuff
you need to know to master your camera and digital
darkroom. But until you have time to digest all that
information, don’t settle for mediocre pictures.
Instead, give this chapter a quick scan during your
afternoon coffee break. Just by taking the ten simple
steps outlined herein, you can immediately get better
results from your digital camera.
Lock in Exposure and Focus Properly
If you use an autofocus, autoexposure camera and haven’t taken any photog-
raphy classes or read other books on the subject, you may not be aware that
you need to press the shutter button in a certain way for the automatic mech-
anisms to work properly.

258
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can’t just jab the shutter button down in one quick press. Instead, frame
the shot and press and hold the button down halfway. Wait until the camera
signals you — usually with a beep or a light in or near the viewfinder — that
it has locked in the exposure and focus. Then press the button the rest of the
way down.
Chapter 2 offers more tips about solving exposure and focus problems.
Take Advantage of Automatic Scene Modes
Experienced photographers adjust two main camera controls, aperture (f-stop)
and shutter speed, to manipulate focus and exposure. For example, when
shooting a portrait, many photographers throw the background into soft
focus by using a large aperture (low f-stop number).
For people who don’t have the time or inclination to dig into this area of 
photographic science, most digital cameras offer automatic scene modes or
creative modes. You tell the camera the type of picture you want to take —
portrait, action photo, and so on — and it automatically chooses the best
aperture, shutter speed, and other options to capture that type of image.
Scene modes typically are indicated by icons like the ones listed in Table 10-1.
(The symbols in the table are generic; check your manual to find out how the
symbols look on your model.) Note that some cameras have dozens of scene
modes to discover; start by getting acquainted with the four standard modes
listed in the table. Usually, you can select the major modes via a dial or button
on the back of the camera and choose other modes through the camera menus.
Table 10-1

What It Does

focus by reducing aperture size

Use Flash Outdoors; Go Without Indoors
That’s right, if you’re outside, shoot with flash. If you’re inside, shoot without
flash. I know, that advice is probably the exact opposite of what you’ve
always believed about using your camera’s flash. But because the built-in
flash on most cameras produces strong, narrowly focused light, it often
results in uneven lighting and harsh shadows like the one you see in the left
portrait in Figure 10-1. Flash can also mar the skin with tiny hot spots — areas
of glare — and red-eye. With still-life shots, flash can produce flares in metal,
glass, and other reflective objects. So whenever possible, set your camera to
“no flash” mode for indoor pictures.
To light the scene, turn on lots of room lights. You also can pose your subject
by a window if you’re shooting during the daytime. For my example photo, I
posed the subject in the front hallway of his home, which was flooded by sun-
light coming through a large window. If lighting is dim, put the camera on a
tripod to ensure a blur-free shot; the exposure time required may be longer
than you can handhold the camera. Also note that you may need to switch to
manual white balance when the room is illuminated both by household lights
and daylight; Chapter 2 covers this issue.
Figure 10-1: A built-in flash creates harsh shadows (left). For better results, turn off the flash
and shoot by available light (right).

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
For outdoor shots, on the other hand, the small burst of light from a built-in
flash helps eliminate shadows that often occur when your light source — in
this case, the sun — is above the subject. Chapter 2 also offers an illustration
of the difference a flash can make to outdoor portraits, even on a sunny day.
Pay Attention to the Background
A busy background can draw the eye
from your subject and spoil an other-
wise great shot, as illustrated by the
top image in Figure 10-2. So before
you press the shutter button, scan
the frame for distracting objects and
reposition your subjects if necessary.
Look for a plain or subtly patterned
background — curtains, a couch
cushion, or large floor pillow can
work for candid snapshots around
the house, as illustrated in the lower
image in Figure 10-2.
For my images, taken in a window-
less basement where I was forced to
use my flash, the change in back-
ground had a side benefit, too. In
the first image, the flash bounced
off the bookshelves, creating a halo
of reflected light. And at the original
camera angle, the subjects were look-
ing almost directly into the flash, a
sure path to red-eye. Posing the pair
on the floor pillow and changing the
camera angle solved both problems.
The fabric didn’t reflect light, and
the eyes were angled upward instead
of directly at the flash, eliminating
red-eye.
If you take lots of product shots or business portraits, visit a fabric store and
paw through the remnant table to find inexpensive backdrops. That was my
source for the backdrop in Figure 10-1, in fact; I paid all of $2 for it. A canvas
drop-cloth from the hardware store also makes a good, neutral background.
For times when you absolutely have no control over the background, visit
Chapter 4 to find out how to make it less distracting by applying a blur filter
in your photo editor.
Figure 10-2: A change in background and
camera angle produced a nicer portrait.

Follow the Rule of Thirds
For more interesting pictures,
imagine that your viewfinder
or LCD monitor is divided into
thirds horizontally and verti-
cally, like a tic-tac-toe board.
Then place your subject or
focal point at one of the spots
where those lines intersect, as
shown in Figure 10-3.
At first, you’ll need to remind
yourself to follow this time-
honored compositional 
technique, known as the rule
of thirds. But after a while,
you’ll instinctively frame your
pictures this way.
Notice one other aspect of the
photo in Figure 10-3: The com-
position is arranged to create
movement — that is, lead the
eye from one side of the frame
to the other, providing addi-
tional visual interest. In this
case, the eye is drawn from the
rocks in the lower right corner
to the boats in the upper left
corner.
Frame Loosely to Allow for Flexible Cropping
Most digital cameras create images with an aspect ratio, or proportions, of 4:3.
Those proportions stem from the fact that digital cameras were originally
designed to create photos for viewing on computer monitors, which until
recently had screens that were four units wide by three units tall.
The problem is that our standard photo print size, 4 x 6 inches, was created
for reproduction of film negatives, which have an aspect ratio of 3:2. So if you
want a 4 x 6-inch print of a digital original, you have to crop away part of the
photo. Ditto for a 5 x 7 or 8 x 10. The same problem arises, of course, when
you enlarge a 3:2 film negative to either of those larger print sizes.

Figure 10-3: Divide the frame into thirds and position
your subject at a spot where the lines intersect.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
To give yourself the flexibility of cropping your photos to any traditional
print size, frame your pictures loosely, leaving a good margin of background
around your subject. For example, the image in Figure 10-4 shows a 4:3 digital
original. The white border inside the image shows the amount of the compo-
sition that will remain if the picture is cropped to a 4 x 6-inch photo.
Figure 10-4: Leave a margin of background around your subject so that you can crop the
image to standard frame sizes.
Check Your Camera’s Quality Settings
Three settings affect the quality of the images that your digital camera can
capture. Chapter 2 explains the details, but here’s the short story:
 Resolution (megapixels): Set your camera to capture enough pixels to
generate prints that contain at least 200 pixels per inch (ppi). For exam-
ple, if your end goal is an 8 x 10-inch print, your resolution setting
should be 1600 x 2000 pixels or more. Up the pixel count if you plan to
crop the image in your photo editor.
 ISO: As you raise the ISO, you increase the camera’s light sensitivity,
enabling you to snap a picture in less light. But a higher ISO usually

translates into a defect called noise, which gives your picture a speckled
look, so keep the ISO as low as possible. (Also avoid Auto ISO, which
adjusts the setting without your input.)
 File Format (JPEG, TIFF, or Camera Raw): JPEG, the standard picture
format, applies lossy compression, which removes some image data in
order to create smaller files. JPEG produces excellent pictures if you
select the highest-quality JPEG setting that your camera offers. (Check
your manual for instructions.) TIFF and Camera Raw, available on some
cameras, don’t apply lossy compression and so offer the highest picture
quality. But both TIFF and Camera Raw create large files, and you must
convert those files to JPEG in your photo editor before you can share
them online.
Say “Cheese”? Please Don’t!
For more captivating people pictures, resist the urge to line up everyone
into a formal grouping and photograph them standing at attention, shouting
“cheese!” Instead, capture people interacting or doing activities they love.
Not only will your pictures be more interesting, they’ll reveal more of your
subjects’ personalities. I offer up the photos in Figure 10-5 as an example.
After capturing the traditional, side-by-side pose, I asked the brother-and-
sister team to “go crazy and have fun!” The right image, taken during that
part of the shoot, perfectly captures the playful but loving nature of this duo. 
Figure 10-5: This brother-and-sister team looks fine in the formal shot (left), but the unposed version is more
engaging (right).

264
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Save Edited Photos in the JPEG Format
If you open a photograph in your photo editor and then make changes to the
picture, don’t save your edited photo in the JPEG format. Every time you
resave in the JPEG format, you apply more lossy compression, dumping more
image data and degrading picture quality. (Merely opening and viewing the
photo doesn’t do any damage.)
Always save your edited photos in a lossless format, such as TIFF or, in
Photoshop Elements, the PSD (Photoshop) format. If you want to share
your edited photo online, make another copy of the finished picture in the
JPEG format.
Chapter 3 talks about saving photos; Chapter 2 explains more about file
formats.
Calibrate Your Monitor for Color Accuracy
For you to properly assess your photos on your computer monitor, the moni-
tor must provide an accurate display. Unfortunately, most monitors are slightly
out of whack in that department, adding a slight red, green, or blue color cast
to everything you see on-screen. And if your display colors are off base, you
can’t make good decisions about whether your photo needs any color correc-
tion in your photo editor. You also increase the likelihood that your on-screen
colors won’t match your printed colors. In many cases, the printer is actually
on target, and the monitor is to blame for color-matching problems.
To avoid these problems, calibrate your monitor every few months (or more
often, if you can). If you use Photoshop Elements for Windows and have a
CRT monitor — in other words, not an LCD monitor — a free calibration tool
called Adobe Gamma is available to you. In Windows XP, click the Start
button, click Control Panel, set the Control Panel to Classic View, and then
double-click the Adobe Gamma icon. You see the screen shown in Figure 10-6.
Click the Step By Step button and then click Next to start the calibration
process. (Note: You may need to install Adobe Gamma separately from the
program installation CD, depending on the version of Elements you use.)
If you use an LCD monitor, you can buy a third-party calibration tool from
companies such as Gretag-Macbeth (www.gretagmacbeth.com) and
Colorvision (www.colorvision.com). But note that LCD monitors aren’t the
best choice for color-correction projects because the colors vary so much
depending on the angle of viewing.

Figure 10-6: Elements for Windows provides a calibration tool 
called Adobe Gamma.
On the Mac, the System Preferences dialog box offers a similar tool, provided
with the operating system itself. Navigate to the Displays section of the
dialog box to get to the panel shown in Figure 10-7. Click the Color button,
choose your monitor, and then click Calibrate.
Figure 10-7: On a Mac, the System Preferences dialog box 
contains a calibration tool.

T
his book ships with a DVD that contains all sorts of goodies, including trial
photo software plus video lessons in which I show you exactly how I
created some of the photo projects. Before I detail exactly what’s on the DVD,
though, I need to emphasize a couple of critical points about this type of DVD:
 The DVD is a data disc, not a movie DVD. That means that the DVD
plays only in the DVD drive on your computer, not on the player you
may have hooked up to your TV or on a portable DVD movie player. 
 To play the tutorial movies, you need Apple QuickTime Movie Player.
If you don’t already have the player, you can download a free copy from
the Apple Web site, www.apple.com. See the upcoming section “Using
the DVD” for more information about viewing the tutorials.
 If your computer has a separate CD drive and DVD drive, be sure to
use the DVD drive. I don’t say this to insult your intelligence — they look
exactly the same from the outside, and it’s easy to get them mixed up.
Or is it just me? At any rate, a CD drive won’t be able to read the DVD.
 Keep the DVD in its protective sleeve when not in use. Otherwise,
the disc may become scratched or otherwise damaged, and thus
unplayable.
With that bit of housekeeping out of the way, the rest of the appendix
explains how to install the trial software, adds a few notes about viewing
the video tutorials, and provides a complete list of the DVD contents.

268
Digital Photo Projects For Dummies 
System Requirements
In order to access and use all the content on the DVD, your computer needs
to meet the following system requirements: 
 A PC with a Pentium or faster processor; or a Mac OSX computer with
a G3 or faster processor
 At least 512MB of system memory (RAM) and enough empty hard drive
space to hold the programs that you want to install
 Microsoft Windows 2000 or later; or Mac OSX system software 10.1 or later
 A DVD-ROM drive
Also note that to run Adobe Photoshop Elements, the software featured in
this book, your system must offer a monitor resolution of at least 1024 x 768.
If your computer doesn’t match up to most of these requirements, you may
have problems using the software and files on the DVD. For the latest and
greatest information, please refer to the ReadMe file included on the DVD.
If you need more information on the basics of computer systems, check out
these books published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.: PCs For Dummies, by Dan
Gookin; Macs For Dummies, by Edward C. Baig; Windows Vista For Dummies or
Windows XP For Dummies, both by Andy Rathbone.
Using the DVD
To get starting using the content on the DVD, take these first steps: 
1. Insert the DVD into your computer’s DVD-ROM drive.
The license agreement appears.
Note to Windows users: The interface won’t launch if you have autorun
disabled. In that case, choose Start➪Run. In the dialog box that appears,
type D:\start.exe. (Replace D with the proper letter if your DVD-ROM
drive uses a different letter. If you don’t know the letter, see how your
DVD-ROM drive is listed under My Computer.) Click OK.
Note for Mac users: The DVD icon will appear on your desktop. Double-
click the icon to open the DVD and then double-click the Start icon.
2. Read through the license agreement, and then click the Accept button
if you want to use the DVD.
The DVD interface appears.
3. On the left side of the window, click the Software, Video Tutorials, or
Sample Images button, depending on what you want to do.

To install the trial software, follow the on-screen instructions. To view the
movies or work with the sample images, see the further instructions laid out
in the next two sections.
Viewing the tutorial movies
To view the movies, you need a copy of the Apple QuickTime Player. If you
don’t have the player, visit the Apple Web site, www.apple.com, to download
a free copy of the player. Follow the instructions at the Web site to install and
start the player.
To ensure that the movies play smoothly, I recommend that you copy the
movie files to your computer’s hard drive before attempting to play them.
The movie files are large, so many computers may have trouble playing them
directly from the DVD. If your hard drive is limited in space, copy and watch
a single movie at a time, deleting the movie after you view it to make room for
the next one.
Here’s the process for copying and viewing the movies: 
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding section and then click the Video
Tutorials button.
2. Click the category of the movie that you want to view.
See the upcoming section “Video tutorials” for a complete listing of what
each category contains. After you choose a category, a window appears
showing you the contents of the folder. The window follows the standard
Windows or Mac operating system design, depending on which type of
computer you use.
3. Copy the movie files to your hard drive as you would copy any file.
Windows: Select the movie file and then choose Edit➪Copy to Folder to
start the copying process.
Mac: On a Mac, drag the file to the folder where you want to store the
movie, following the normal Finder techniques. 
4. Exit the DVD interface by clicking the Exit button at the top of the
window. 
5. Start QuickTime Player.
Follow the same procedure you use to start any program on your system.
6. Choose File➪Open File to display the standard Windows or Mac file-
opening dialog box.
7. Navigate to the spot on your hard drive where you copied the movie
files.
8. Select the movie you want to view, and click Open.

From this point forward, just click the Play button in the player window. If you
need help using the player, choose Help➪QuickTime Player Help in the pro-
gram window.
Working with the sample images
As with the video tutorials, I suggest that you copy the sample images to
your computer’s hard drive before opening them. Your photo-editing soft-
ware can process images located on your hard drive faster than images
located on a CD or DVD.
To copy the images, just follow Steps 1 through 4 in the preceding section.
You then can open the pictures from inside your photo editor as you do any
photo.
What You’ll Find on the DVD
The following sections are arranged by category and provide a listing of the
DVD contents. If you need help with installing the items provided on the DVD,
refer to the instructions in the preceding section.
For each photo program listed, I include the Web address where you can find
more information and purchase the full retail product. I also provide the pro-
gram platform (Windows or Mac) plus the type of software. For future refer-
ence, programs fall into one of the following categories (although not all are
represented on this DVD): 
Shareware programs are fully functional, free, trial versions of copyrighted
programs. If you like particular programs, register with their authors for a
nominal fee and receive licenses, enhanced versions, and technical support. 
Freeware programs are free, copyrighted games, applications, and utilities.
You can copy them to as many computers as you like — for free — most of
them offer no technical support.
Trial, demo, or evaluation versions of software are usually limited either by
time or functionality (such as not letting you save a project after you create it).
Photo-editing programs for beginners
The following programs are aimed at the novice digital photographer, provid-
ing lots of on-screen help and easy-to-use tools. Some programs also offer
tools for organizing your pictures; see the later section “Photo organizing

Sample images
You probably already have lots of your own digital photos, but you may find
it easier to understand the project steps if you work through them the first
time using the same images that you see in the book. So I’ve included as
many of those photos as possible on the DVD. (I don’t include most portraits,
to protect the privacy of the people who appear in them.)
273

274
Digital Photo Projects For Dummies 
The photos are located on the DVD in a folder called Sample Images. You can
either copy them directly from that folder to your hard drive or open them
directly from the DVD. 
Please remember that all the sample photos are copyrighted, so you may not
reproduce them either in print or online without the publisher’s permission.
See the earlier section “Using the DVD” for specifics.
Troubleshooting
I tried my best to compile programs that work on most computers with the
minimum system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and some
programs may not work properly for some reason. The two most common
causes of problems are that your computer doesn’t have enough memory
(RAM) for the programs you want to use, or that other programs are running
that are affecting installation or running of the software. If you get an error
message such as not enough memory or setup cannot continue, try one or
more of the following suggestions:
 Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation
programs sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer
incorrectly believe that it’s being infected by a virus.
 Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the
less memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typi-
cally update files and programs; so if you keep other programs running,
installation may not work properly.
 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer.
This is, admittedly, a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However,
adding more memory can really help the speed of your computer
and allow more programs to run at the same time.
