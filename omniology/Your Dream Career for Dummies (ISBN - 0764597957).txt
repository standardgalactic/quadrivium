clients, students, and readers discover more fulfilling careers and lives.
Carol believes a good career is one in which you can be yourself at work, live your life fully,
and feel engaged by the work you do. She guides people from all walks of life to create careers

spective and her career-change programs, visit her site, www.careerclarityprogram.com,

Carol’s unique understanding of the emotional aspects of changing careers grew from her
professional and personal experiences. She became interested in transitions in 1983 while
completing her PhD in industrial/organizational psychology at Purdue University. As an orga-
nizational consultant within a major insurance company, Carol facilitated various corporate
transitions and mentored new employees while dealing with her grief surrounding her father’s
death and a period of severe burnout that led to her own career change.
Carol shares her ideas about the emotional side of career changes and other life changes 
in The Seasons of Change: Using Nature’s Wisdom to Grow through Life’s Inevitable Ups and
Downs (Conari Press, 1998). To find out more about The Seasons of Change and her retreats
and programs on this topic, visit her site, www.seasonsofchange.com, and her blog,

In 2002, Carol began training other Transition Professionals to use her Career Clarity Program

programs are described on the sites listed earlier.

University, Carol presents at conferences and meetings and is a guest on radio talk shows
nationwide.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Revising my original For Dummies book, Changing Careers For Dummies, has been a true joy.
The opportunity to enhance and update the book has been inspiring, exciting, and gratifying.
I hope you find your dream career in your journey through this book.
I want to begin by thanking my acquisitions editor, Kathy Cox, for taking the time for lunch in
October 2004, where the idea for this revision came to light. I’m grateful to Carol Susan Roth,
my agent, for stepping in to finalize the deal. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working with my edi-
tors, Alissa Schwipps, Tina Sims, and Marilyn Maze, who each provided key thoughts that
strengthened this book. Although I haven’t worked with them directly, I appreciate the graph-
ics and layout teams who transformed my Word documents into the book you hold in your
hand. And finally, I’m grateful to the marketing and publicity teams for the work they do to
bring this book to those who need it most — career changers everywhere.
My Career Clarity clients and my Career Clarity Coaches have each contributed to this revi-
sion with their questions, requests, suggestions, and experiences. I thank each of them and
several specific Career Clarity Coaches, Brenda Davis, Jeremy Castilino, Rebecca Kieler, and
Juanita Mast, who reviewed and strengthened several lists in this book. I continue to be
indebted to those who contributed so graciously to the first book.
I’ve been blessed to have a wonderful support team while I divided my time between my
writing, my work with clients, and my training classes for professionals. I’m grateful to Jean
Hansen, Lynda Nuremberg, Sherry Grantham, and Vilma Guevara for taking on the adminis-
trative tasks that lightened my workload. I couldn’t have kept my business functioning and
growing without their help. Aleta Cooper and Susan Goodwin, with joy in their hearts, helped
me keep my physical world functioning smoothly. A special thanks goes to Veronica Conway,
Gloria Balcom, Ellen Silva, the eWomen Publishing Network, and Kelley Falk for the work we
did between deadlines to enhance my overall business.
My family continues to be one of my greatest sources of support. As always, I find great
joy in the connection I have with my Mom; my brother, Tom; his wife, Amy; and the McKids.
I’ve been thrilled this year to reconnect with my grandmother’s cousin, Lorraine Phillips,
and to meet her nieces. It’s been quite an experience to learn about my great-grandfather’s
career aspirations during the 1920s. I also want to thank Karen and Mark, and Vicky and Tony
(welcome to the family!) for welcoming me into the family with open arms.
My favorite memory while writing this book was the last-minute road trip my husband, Kent
Fields, and I took to see the once-in-a-lifetime spring bloom in Death Valley. It’s an amazingly
freeing feeling to know that I can be in the middle of nowhere and open my laptop in a tent 
to enter the editing changes I’ve made while waiting for a ranger talk to start. The ultimate
flextime/flexplace work experience. Have laptop, will travel!
To my husband, Kent: Your ever-present love, continuous support, creative input, and
patience over the last six months have been invaluable. Here’s to our next road trip escape! 
I can’t wait!

Foreword
M
ost forewords are written to urge you to read the book. But I know you are going to
like this book, so you need no urging there.
What I want to urge in this foreword is something else, and that is the importance of career
change, and more particularly, the importance of considering a career change in your own life.
Experts tell us that the average person goes through the job hunt eight times. I have observed
that each time we go through a job hunt, we face a crossroads: Should we do a mechanical job
search, or should we do a life-changing job search?
The mechanical job search is basically a matching process. It is so mechanical, even the
Internet can do it for us. Your resume. All the employers’ job openings. Is there a match?
The site’s “robot” will give you the news by morning. That’s the mechanical job search.
The life-changing job search is different. If the mechanical job search starts with the labor
market as “the given,” the life-changing job search starts with you as “the given.” The mechan-
ical job search assumes that you’re going to go on doing basically what you were doing before,
but the life-changing job search assumes that all bets are off. You have certain transferable
skills. They can be used anywhere. So, where would you most like to work? What would you
most like to do for the rest of your life? Dream, dream, dream. More often than you can imag-
ine, those dreams can be turned into reality!
A life-changing job search is, of course, just another phrase for “career-change.” But I call it
life-changing, because it involves so much more than just changing your career. In fact, there
are four things that inevitably get weighed in a life-changing job search.
The first is the center of your life, which involves a reconsideration of what you want your
life to revolve around. If it’s currently work, do you want it to be family instead; or if it’s cur-
rently making money, do you want it to be God instead? That sort of thing.
The second is the constants in your life. What about you has remained constant through all
these years? Your skills, your values, your friends, what? Do an inventory, and then put these
in their order of importance.
The third is the context of your life. What gives you perspective about your life? How do you
measure how well you’re doing in life? For many, this context of their life is God. If that’s not
yours, what is?
The fourth (and final) one is alternatives. You need to ask yourself how many alternative
ways you have of describing what you most enjoy doing. How many alternative ways do 
you have of describing your target organizations or plans? How many alternative ways do
you have of searching for that? A life-changing job search is a search for alternatives, so as 
to have more freedom.
If it’s a life-changing job search you’re weighing, that is to say, a career-change, plus, you 
can do no better than to read this book. It’s one of the best I’ve ever read on career change.
Carol has really done her homework, and she offers very many helpful ideas to guide you 
on your way.

Your Dream Career For Dummies 

Introduction
W
hether you’re changing careers by choice or due to circumstances beyond your con-
trol, you stand on the brink of an awesome experience.
Thanks to advances in technology and added ﬂexibility in the workplace, more employment
options exist today than in any other time in history. Take advantage of this opportunity to
create a new career for yourself that not only taps your favorite talents but also lets you live
the life you want to live.
Although it’s normal to have some concerns about how your career change will unfold, walk
into this opportunity with an open mind. The chapters in this book show you, step by step,
how to gain clarity about your next career move. Giving yourself the gift of exploration allows
you to discover previously unexplored options and solutions.
If you want, or need, to make a career change, don’t let a shaky economy or a personal situa-
tion stop you from looking to the future. The ﬁrst stages of a career change involve imagining,
thinking, exploring, and planning. You can embark on these steps now — without disrupting
your current employment situation. After you know more about your new direction, you can
decide when to make your move.
About This Book
A dream career is more than a career that allows you to use your talents and skills in a satis-
fying and fulﬁlling way. A dream career also allows you to express who you are and to live
the life you want.
Many career change programs focus on what you want to do in your work — the passions
and skills you want to use. As a result, you sometimes end up in a situation where you have
a great job that’s at cross purposes with who you are and how you want to live. Try as you
might, you can’t ﬁnd a way to include your needs and desires in the picture.
Rather than have you squeeze your personal life in around the edges of a great career, Your
Dream Career For Dummies has you start by understanding who you are and what you want
at a personal level. Then, by using that information as a foundation, you build a career that
enables you to thrive in all areas of your life — not just at work.
Some sections of this book may be more relevant to you and your situation than others. You
can dip in and out wherever you like because, like all For Dummies books, each chapter is a
stand-alone module. That said, identifying your next career is a process that unfolds one step
at a time. As a result, there’s a thread that ties all the chapters together, as the worksheets
you do in the early chapters help you gain clarity in the later chapters.
In this book, you won’t ﬁnd text that drones on and on. Instead you ﬁnd short, concise, 
get-right-to-the-point explanations about worksheets that walk you through the process 
of understanding your own situation in more depth. During your journey, you may access
other resources as well to help you research your career ideas and explore your options.

Whether you want to make a change in the next couple of months or the next few years, the
information, worksheets, and examples in this book help you do the following:
 Open your mind to creative exploration
 Deepen your sense of your personal style and lifestyle needs
 Deﬁne what you need in your work environment
 Transform your passions and interests into viable career options
 Explore numerous career ideas
 Blend your ideal career with the realities of your life
 Outline your action plan to ﬁnd a job, start a business, or return to school
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things consistent and easy
to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by a clear deﬁnition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that some of the following statements apply to you, in which case you’ll ﬁnd this
book especially helpful in your quest to ﬁnd a new career:
 You absolutely dread getting up in the morning to go to work, but you keep on keeping
on because you have no idea how to identify your next career.
 You have an idea for your next career, but no matter how hard you try, you can’t seem
to get from here to there.
 You may be facing a layoff and want to plan ahead.
 You need to make a good living, and you want to spend more time with your family or
enjoying your hobbies.
 Your job isn’t so bad, but you wish it had more meaning or made a contribution.
 You’ve worked hard for years at a job that wasn’t especially satisfying, and now you
want a career you thoroughly enjoy, or you’ve retired and ﬁnd that you are bored or
need an infusion of cash.
 You’ve graduated recently, and your work isn’t what you thought it would be.
I assume that if you’re currently out of work, you may want to focus ﬁrst on ﬁnding an
interim job. Then, after you have some income coming in, you can come back to sort out
your dream career options. As you might expect, thinking creatively and exploring your
options freely is difﬁcult when you aren’t sure how you’re going to pay this month’s mort-
gage or rent. Another beneﬁt of this strategy is that you can use your interim job as a
laboratory to clarify what you know you want in your next career.

Your Dream Career For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
I divide Your Dream Career For Dummies into ﬁve parts. A quick review of the Table of
Contents and the following description of the parts gives you a solid overview of the entire
book. If you want information about a particular topic, the Index can also help you locate it.
Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change
The chapters in Part I help you explore what is and isn’t working in your current career and
life so that you can determine what you need and want for yourself and your family in your
next career.
Part II: Finding Your Passions
Use the extensive checklists, worksheets, and brainstorming techniques in this part to 
discover your passions and interests and then parlay them into a list of up to 40 viable
career ideas. Chapters toward the end of Part II help you trim your ideas down to your
two best ideas.
Part III: Exploring Possible Career Directions
The chapters in this part describe career ideas that may intrigue you if you have a certain
skill, talent, or interest. For each career area, I provide a description of the career area that
spells out what the career entails and what it takes to be in the career, related jobs and 
specialties that show you professional alternatives, and links that take you to the primary
professional association for the career area so that you can further your exploration. Use
the diverse information in this part as a springboard to brainstorm ways to weave your 
talents into careers that satisfy you and ﬁt your life.
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life
After you have a career idea or two that you want to pursue, Part IV helps you blend your
dream career ideas with what you know you need for your life to run smoothly. Through
exploration, conversation, and experimentation, you reﬁne your ideas until you have enough
conﬁdence in your direction to take action. Depending on your situation, your next step
may focus on getting more training, launching your job search, or starting a business.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Changing careers can be a roller coaster of emotions because, for a time, you’re between
two lives. You can’t go back, and yet you don’t know enough to fast-forward to your new life.
The chapters in this part guide you through two of the toughest hurdles: convincing your-
self, with good reason, that the idea you’re contemplating is indeed a good move for you and
showing you creative ways to get from where you are now to where you want to be — living
the life your dream career enables you to live.

moving forward as smoothly as possible. Whether the tip is a time saver or a step saver,
paying attention to these hints helps you move forward.
Any information next to this icon is something you want to be wary about. Watch your step
when you see a Warning.
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover to gain valuable insights about your
next career. Each chapter covers some part of the career change puzzle, and some chapters
may be more relevant to your situation than others. If you launch into a chapter that builds
on something from a previous chapter, the text points you to the precise section or work-
sheet you need to complete to make the most of the current chapter.
If you are just beginning your quest for a new career and aren’t sure where to start, I suggest
going through the book chapter by chapter to build your picture of what you want one layer
at a time.
If you’ve already done some thinking about your next career, read the following options to
choose your best next step:
 If you hear a voice inside that questions whether you can change careers, I encourage
you to use Chapter 2 as a resource to open your mind to possibilities and discover how
to help yourself move forward when you feel stuck.
 If you know that your personal life is a key factor in deﬁning your dream career, spend
some time reading Chapters 3 and 4.
 When your work environment and work community are a crucial part of your dream
career, Chapters 5 and 6 help you articulate what you want out of your work setting.
 If you’re anxious to discover what you’ll do in your dream career, the activities in
Chapters 7 and 8 are a key to your success. After you have some ideas about what you
want to do in your work, use Chapters 9 and 10 to brainstorm a set of viable career
ideas for yourself.
 When you have a career idea or two in mind, use Chapters 14 and 15 to expand what
you know about your ideas.
By setting your sights on your dream career, you’re embarking on a journey. As with any
kind of travel, you won’t reach your destination instantaneously or effortlessly, but in a way
the travel itself is part of the adventure. Enjoy the paths, discoveries, and even the detours
that unfold as you move toward your next career.

Your Dream Career For Dummies 

Part I
Setting the Stage for 
Your Career Change

In this part . . .
F
inding your dream career is like searching for a hidden
treasure. The more clues you have in hand, the more
likely you are to track down the prize. This part assists you
in identifying the clues to what truly works for you in terms
of your personal style, your lifestyle, and your work style.

Chapter 1
Evaluating Your Current Situation
In This Chapter
 Checking in with yourself and your life
 Assessing your current work situation
 Evaluating the work you do
 Getting a sense of your priorities
D
id you know that you’re sitting on a gold mine? The very same job that frustrates you
or bores you to tears holds a number of valuable clues about your future career. In the
same vein, the points of stress in your life can, with a little thought, prove to be enlighten-
ing, as well.
This chapter helps you assess where you are today. Taking some time to get a sense of 
yourself and your life at this point in time creates a foundation for building your next career.
The more you know about what you want and need in your life, the more you can create a
new career that ﬁts you and enhances your life. To make this process as easy for you as pos-
sible, a series of worksheets walks you through this discovery process one step at a time.
If you aren’t working, use your last job as your frame of reference for this chapter. Or if you’ve
been at home raising your children, recovering from an illness, or caring for a relative, think
of your current experiences as your “job” in the following worksheets.
Making the Worksheets Work for You
Each worksheet in this chapter consists of a list of elements in the left-hand column that are
relevant to your personal life or your current job. When you rate each element, put an X
into the appropriate box:
 Good: This element enhances your life or work.
 Okay: This element could be better or it could be worse. It either ﬂuctuates or is gener-
ally mediocre.
 Not So Good: This element in some way diminishes your quality of life or your enjoy-
ment of your work.
After you make your rating, note the reasons why you rated each element the way you did,
using the following guidelines:
 If you marked an element “Good,” explain what’s working.
 If you marked an element “Okay” or “Not So Good,” indicate what’s not working in this
area of your work or life.

If you see any elements that aren’t listed but are relevant to you, add them in the blanks at
the bottom of each table.
In Worksheet 1-8, you have an opportunity to review your responses to Worksheets 1-1
through 1-7 to get an overview of yourself and your life. At that point you identify the ele-
ments of your life that are most important to take into account as you create your new
career.
As Sarah, a photography studio manager from Connecticut, completed Worksheet 1-1 later
in this chapter, she discovered some very important information about how her personal
life impacts her career. Review Figure 1-1 to see her responses. As you can see, Sarah is feel-
ing stretched to the limit right now as she juggles her family responsibilities and her work
tasks. Her time is so limited that she rarely has time for herself and her needs. What she
takes away from this worksheet is that she deﬁnitely needs to take her new family situation
into account as she envisions her next career.
Looking at Your Personal Life
Because you’re reading this book to create a new career, you may question why I start out
by asking about your personal life. The way I’ve always looked at it, a career works best
when it ﬁts with your life. The more you know about yourself and how you want to live, the
more you know about your new career.
If you’ve been working too hard or totally focusing on how frustrated you are with work,
you may have lost track of yourself in the process. To make clear decisions about your
future career, you must reach in to ﬁnd the true you again. Looking at your life through 
different lenses can help you see yourself more clearly.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

 Take a moment to think about the last time you really let go of work. Perhaps you took
a long weekend or an extended vacation. How did it feel to relax and enjoy life?
 Now, think about how you feel at the end of the day or after a week at work. Do you feel
like yourself or does it take you a while each night to re-ﬁnd yourself?
Rate the elements of how and who you are in Worksheet 1-1 to take stock of how you are
these days. Evaluating this information helps you clarify what’s working and not working in
your current situation. Later you use this information to verify that your new career idea is
a good ﬁt for you.
Before you can focus clearly on the future, you must also take a close look at your current
lifestyle. If some aspects of your life work well, you want to keep those aspects intact. If 
certain areas of your life are not satisfying, you can ﬁnd ways to alleviate the problems by
making different decisions about your future.
Put your career and time at work on the back burner for a moment and think about your
personal life. As you scan your life, answer these questions for yourself:
 How do you live your life? What do you like about it? What could be better?
 How do you socialize with others?
 What do you do for fun?
 How do you and your family spend time together?
 How is your ﬁnancial situation?
 How happy are you with where you live?

Assess how you’re living by rating the elements listed in Worksheet 1-2. Later, this informa-
tion helps you know that your new career not only supports you but also enhances the life
you want to live.
Sizing Up Your Current Work Arrangement
It’s Sunday night. In ten hours, you have to get up and go to work. On a scale from 1 to 10,
how would you rate the intensity of your Sunday Night Blues? Are you looking forward to
returning to your ofﬁce, seeing your colleagues, and using your creative skills? Or do you
once again dread the thought of another ﬁve days stuck at work doing tasks that bore you,
interacting with people who bug you, and dealing with ofﬁce politics?
What about the intensity of your Monday Morning Malaise? As you travel to work and pre-
pare to enter the doors, how do you feel?
Although these two questions serve as a quick barometer of how you feel about your work,
looking at the pros and cons of each element of your work arrangement gives you insights
about what you eventually need from your job to live the life you want.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

Think about your work and your life over the last month and ask yourself the following
questions:
 Does your current work arrangement allow you to live the life you want?
 Have you missed any opportunities due to the demands of your job?
 How has your schedule worked for you?
 How does your workload impact your life?
 What do you like or dislike about the way your work is structured, whether you work
full-time or part-time?
Worksheet 1-3 lets you clarify how you feel about how you work. Evaluating your current work
situation helps you pinpoint ways your new career can improve your satisfaction at work.
Your income and beneﬁts also impact how you live your life. Think about the past year, both
the high points and the low points. Ask yourself the following questions:
 What have you been able to do as a result of having the income you do?
 Did you use any of your beneﬁts this year? How did they work for you?
 Did your pay schedule meet your needs?
 Did the form of income you received (salary, commission, overtime pay, or stock
options) have any effect on your lifestyle?
 What haven’t you been able to do as a result of your income or beneﬁts?
Worksheet 1-4 gives you a space to jot down your thoughts about important issues regard-
ing your pay and beneﬁts. Being clear about your needs helps you set your sights on a
career that’s a good ﬁt.

Chapter 1: Evaluating Your Current Situation

For some people, the environment in which they work is more important than what they do
on the job. By looking at what does and doesn’t work for you in your work environment, you
gain valuable clues that help you evaluate the ﬁt of future work environments.
In your mind’s eye, think about your day at work — from the moment you leave your home
to the time you return. Ask yourself the following questions:
 What is your commute like?
 How do you feel arriving at work?
 How does your body respond when you enter the building?
 How do you feel while you are at work?
 What is your return commute like?
 How do you feel when you get home from work?
The sensations and impressions you feel as you answer these questions give you insights
about how speciﬁc elements of your work environment affect you on a daily basis.
Use Worksheet 1-5 to rate how happy you are with speciﬁc aspects of your current work
environment. In addition to noticing what doesn’t work in your current job, remember to
take note of elements of your work that you enjoy and want to re-create in your new work
setting.
At ﬁrst glance, you may feel as though you have little choice about whom you work with.
You can, however, choose a career that allows you to interact with the kinds of people you
enjoy most, whether they’re colleagues who share your interests or clients who receive
your services.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

To discover more about what does and doesn’t work for you in your current work commu-
nity, take an imaginary walk through the halls of your ofﬁce. Think about the people you
work with on a regular basis:
 Envision stopping at each ofﬁce or cubicle to get a sense of your interactions with each
person.
 Revisit the meetings you’ve attended this week.
 Take a mental look at your e-mail inbox. Whose names show up there?
 Who comes to mind when you scan your telephone log or messages?
With your impressions fresh in your mind, rate the following categories of people you inter-
act with at work in Worksheet 1-6. Your response to the question “Why?” may, in this case,
be a person’s name.
What’s Working and Not Working 
about the Work You Do
Obviously what you do on your job impacts how you feel about your career. Think about
the tasks and projects you’ve worked on this year and ask yourself the following questions:
 How do you feel when you do your work?
 What bores you?
 What excites and motivates you?
 When do you feel engaged by your work?
Take some time to write down your thoughts in Worksheet 1-7 regarding the elements that
make up your work tasks. Although you may be fed up with your current job, you may ﬁnd,
upon reﬂection, that you actually enjoy some pieces of what you do. Understanding your
current situation in detail gives you insights about what elements of your current work may
be worth carrying forward into a new career.

Chapter 1: Evaluating Your Current Situation

Recording Your Key Needs
Look over the worksheets in this chapter to get an overview of what’s going on in your work
and life. Then take it deeper. Identify ﬁve factors that, if resolved, would allow you to love
your life and your work more than you do now. By identifying these issues now, you know
what issues you’d like to resolve with your next career. In fact, in Chapter 16 you return to
this list to ﬁnd the right ﬁt between your personal needs and desires and your potential
career ideas.
Use Worksheet 1-8 to write down your key needs. If you can, state your needs in terms of
what you want rather than what’s lacking in your life right now. For instance, write down 
“I need more ﬂexibility” rather than “I don’t have enough ﬂexibility.” If you recognize that
something isn’t working for you but you don’t know exactly how you want to ﬁx the situa-
tion, don’t sweat it. Just record your observation the best you can. As you explore the
upcoming chapters, you may discover a new perspective that allows you to articulate your
needs more clearly.
Although you picked up this book to identify your next career, the worksheets in this chap-
ter may show you that another part of your life isn’t working very well. If you feel desperate
to leave your current job, living situation, or relationship, you may be in a toxic situation. If
you’re so worn out by the end of the day that you can’t think straight, you may ﬁnd it hard
to make progress on your career change. The fact is that just making it through the day takes
all you’ve got. You have two possible strategies: Minimize your exposure to the person, set-
ting, or situation that feels toxic or just get out in whatever way you can create. Reach out
for support from a friend or a professional if you don’t see an immediate way out. After you
feel safer, you can focus on your goal to change your career and make much more progress.

dentifying a new career is a journey of discovery. Along the way you experience the
twists and turns of new dreams, unexpected dead ends, and discoveries full of potential.
As with any journey, it helps to prepare yourself with skills you may need along the way.
Throughout this chapter, you experiment with the perspectives, skills, and processes that
help you make the most of your journey.
Appreciating the Benefits of Thinking Ideally
In Chapters 2 through 14, I ask you to think in ideal terms about various elements of your
personal life and your professional life. Your goal, in each chapter, is to describe the best
possible solution or situation for you and your family.
At ﬁrst these requests may seem like pie-in-the-sky ways to address your practical need
for a new career. After all, you need results sooner rather than later. In the end, however,
exploring your ideal vision leads you to more successful outcomes than focusing on the
practicalities of your situation. Here’s why this approach works:
 The journey you’re embarking on helps you create a career that fulﬁlls you profession-
ally, while allowing you to express yourself completely and live your life fully. If you
focus only on resolving the current frustrations you have about your career, you’re
likely to miss key pieces of the puzzle. For instance, you might not lift your vision high
enough to see that there are ways to improve both your career and your life substan-
tially without much extra effort.
 You’re also more likely to be creative when you think from an ideal perspective. From
this elevated vantage point, you think more expansively, take more risks, and see more
possibilities than when you focus on what’s realistic and feasible. Although ﬁnding
your most realistic path to your new career is an important part of Chapters 14
through 19, you can’t embark on that process until you have a clear vision of your
dream career.
 When you focus on your ideal situation, you’re likely to fulﬁll more of your needs and
desires than if you focus your attention only on reasonable next steps. A plan based on
reason, and reason alone, is likely to leave you wanting more. Incorporating your ideal
picture into your plans infuses your vision with life and excitement.

If you’re like most people, you may not spend much time in your daily life thinking of best-
case scenarios. In fact, this new perspective may take some getting used to. Take a moment
to practice thinking ideally in Worksheet 2-1.
If you had all the time, resources, and support you need, what three things would you do
with your time? Remember to think as ideally as possible here. Be expansive. Tap into your
wildest dreams and dearest hopes — even if you’ve never dared to express them before.
Your dream may be to work with animals, work part time, live in a warmer climate during
the winter months, or use your creative skills. Although your dream may feel impossible at
the moment, continue to keep your focus on your ideal.
Identifying What Attracts 
and What Repels You
Another key to discovering your next career rests on your ability to know what attracts you,
what draws you in, and what intrigues you. Throughout this book, you look at lists, recall
former jobs, and imagine yourself in various situations. In each case, I ask you to select the
elements that are most attractive to you.
By knowing what attracts you about a setting, a person, a profession, or a topic, you can
begin to develop an ideal picture of how you want to work and what you want to do on the
job. Furthermore, with this knowledge, you can begin to bring more of what you like into
your life on a daily basis.
Take a moment to record, in Worksheet 2-2, six things in your home or neighborhood that
attract you. There’s really no wrong answer here. Pay attention to what your eye is drawn 
to whether it’s a certain architectural detail, a beautifully designed landscape, a particular
paint color, or an artistic object. Later you apply this same skill to elements of your career,
but it’s often easier to practice using this skill while observing physical aspects of your 
environment.
Now look back at what you wrote and focus for a minute on how you feel when you notice
you are attracted to something in your life. Do you feel a warmth within you, an excitement,
or a sense of freedom? Whatever you feel is ﬁne. Try, if you can, to put your feelings into
words in the second section of Worksheet 2-2. Knowing how you feel when you’re attracted
or drawn to something is a wonderful asset when you’re trying to ﬁnd a career you enjoy.
Whenever you feel this feeling in the future, you know to pay attention because you’ve just
run across something that intrigues you.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

Knowing what repels you is just as important as knowing what appeals to you. When you
know something repels you, you do your best to avoid that thing or situation. If you aren’t
consciously aware of what repels you, you don’t turn away fast enough — you try to make it
work or you try to talk yourself into settling or making do. Force-ﬁtting yourself into an unsa-
vory situation is time consuming, distracting, and draining. The key is to know, as soon as
possible, that you’re repelled by a work environment, a job task, or a person — before you
get so involved in the situation or relationship that you’ll ﬁnd it hard to get out gracefully.
Take a moment to identify the things around you that repel you. Start with your physical
surroundings. Are you repelled by a spot on the carpet, clutter in a neighbor’s yard, a piece
of furniture that needs to be replaced, or a decorative style that’s too sterile or gaudy for
your tastes? In Worksheet 2-3, record the six things in your house or neighborhood that
repel you. Later, the ability to identify what repels you helps you make good decisions
about the work environments and job tasks that are best for you to avoid.
Just as you did with things that attract you, review what repels you and note how you feel
when you notice that something in your life repels you. If you can, put words to this feeling
as well in the second section of Worksheet 2-3.
As you progress through the book, pay attention to how you feel about various ideas and
options. When you feel the emotion associated with things that attract and intrigue you, pay
attention. That clue is as good as gold!
If you feel repelled by something in a list or from a previous experience, take note! Investing
in options that inherently annoy you is a big waste of time and energy. This fact is true even
if the solution makes logical sense, loved ones think it’s your best move, or you have con-
siderable training in the area in question. If just the idea of something turns you off, imagine
the misery you’d feel if you built your next career around this element.

Spotting Clues to Your Future
Although you’re no doubt anxious to discover “The Answer” to your current career dilemma,
that answer isn’t going to appear in a dream or announce itself in a ﬂashing neon sign.
Instead it’s going to unfold one layer at a time.
By being observant as you move through each chapter, you can see signs and clues that
you’re on the right track. Start training your senses to see the following signs that some-
thing is taking shape:
Repetition of words and ideas: If you notice that a certain word or idea shows up in a vari-
ety of worksheets, you know it’s important to you.
Grace, who up until now has been a stay-at-home mom, is looking at her options as she con-
templates going back to work. In her descriptions of her ideal lifestyle (Chapter 4) and her
preferred work environment (Chapters 5 and 6), she noticed that some phrases appeared
repeatedly: “ﬂexibility,” “time with my kids,” and “able to take care of family needs when
necessary.” She rather expected to see that trend. What surprised her was the number of
times the word “engaged” appeared. She realized that she’s ready to plug into a career that
engages her mind and challenges her to apply herself.
New insights: If you experience an Aha! moment while doing a worksheet, write down that
thought. New insights give you a new way to perceive your situation. Your new perspective
may open up new horizons to explore, or the new idea may narrow your focus by clarifying
your needs in a new way. Either way, follow through on your insights to see where they take
you and what else they reveal. Do an Internet search, talk to a friend, or read a relevant
book to learn more about your new discovery. When you know more, reﬂect on how this
information changes or enhances your opportunities.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

Sean, a marketing communications director from New York, decided to focus his job search
on a skill he’d used in his past jobs: producing. As he scanned various job postings, he dis-
covered that a number of interesting positions were freelance opportunities. Although they’re
consistent with his ultimate career dream, the unreliable nature inherent in that kind of work
runs counter to his current ﬁnancial goals and family responsibilities. As a result of this dis-
covery, he narrowed his current job search to full-time producing positions. Simultaneously,
he decided to set his long-term sights on the freelance world. With this information, he can
use his next job(s) to prepare himself to be a candidate for a great project when his respon-
sibilities shift in a couple years.
Increased excitement: If you get excited about anything as you complete the worksheets 
or you explore an idea, pay attention. Your excitement is a clue to your passions. Follow the
thread to see where it leads you. Making a life-changing decision based on just one clue is
risky, but it is a great piece of information about what intrigues you.
Jeannette, a pet food manufacturer from Maryland, already knew she was interested in foods,
the history of food, and ﬁnding creative ways to use food, but the conﬁrmation of her inter-
ests, as she worked through the exercises in this book, helped her stay committed to her
passion. Every time she moved away from the idea of working with food, she didn’t like how
she felt. Every time she refocused on food, she felt excited again. To ﬁnd her niche in the
food world, she networked, went to food-related trade shows, attended classes, hooked up
with a professor doing research on using food as medicine, and explored the work of vari-
ous food companies. In the end, she realized she wanted to use her knowledge and passion
to ﬁnd ways to use food to help people heal and be well.
Internal drive to investigate: If you have a question about what a term means or how it
might apply to you, take some time to quench your curiosity. If you wonder what a career
consists of, explore it in Chapters 14 and 15 to ﬁnd out more. Your desire to know more is
another important clue. Even if the idea you explore doesn’t pan out, you become clearer
about your needs as a result of your exploration.
As Mary, a human resource representative from Los Angeles, California, contemplated possi-
ble careers, she was drawn to learn more about being a physical therapist. In the process 
of reading about the job, talking to contacts, and exploring possible training programs, she
discovered a career she hadn’t known existed: occupational therapist. As a result of her dis-
covery, she switched gears and applied to schools with a master’s degree in occupational
therapy. Last time I talked with her she was completing her ﬁrst term in school.
Making the Most of Being Stuck
Discovering a new career that suits you and your life is a process. As I mentioned, you will
not get “The Answer” you’re looking for instantaneously. You can, however, expect to gain
new insights, ideas, and clarity at each step of the way.
One essential part of your journey involves feeling stuck. Yes, that’s right. I’m here to tell
you that you’re likely to feel stuck at some point or another during the process. Although
you may be tempted to get frustrated and back away from your goal, I encourage you to
stick with it. In the moment you feel stuck, you’re actually the closest you’ve been to a
breakthrough. Hang in there and use the following sections to ﬁnd your way through.
After a breakthrough comes and you shift your perspective of your circumstances, you may
ﬁnd a new way to combine your ideas, you may get a new piece of information that opens
up new opportunities, or you may meet someone who has the perfect contact for you. You
never know upfront what key moves you forward, so stay alert and follow through on any
clues that present themselves.
19
Chapter 2: Opening Yourself to Discovery

Whenever you feel stuck during the journey, come back to this section for ideas on how to
make sense of your situation.
Recognize warning signs
One key to making the most of the times when you feel stuck is to ﬁnd out how to recognize
what you do when you feel stymied. Do you avoid opening this book? Do you complain you
aren’t getting anything from the process? Do you hear a voice telling you to “give it up —
you’ll never ﬁgure this out”? Do you feel so overwhelmed or frustrated that you can’t make
any progress?
Most people tend to behave a certain way when they feel stuck. Take a moment to think of
other times you’ve gotten stuck while working on a personal project or a job assignment.
Then make a list of your behaviors that can serve as a warning that you’re feeling stuck.
Record your thoughts in Worksheet 2-4.
If you notice that you’re stepping into your usual stuck pattern, pay attention. Being stuck
isn’t a sign of failure; it’s a sign that you’re close to a breakthrough!
Claim your interests
One reason you may feel stuck is that you aren’t getting any new answers. You keep coming
up with the same needs or career interests no matter what worksheet you ﬁll out. If you
were expecting or hoping to come up with a completely new idea and your answers just
repeat what you already knew, you most likely feel frustrated.
When this happens, there’s a good chance that your answers are conﬁrming something
that’s true for you! Rather than ﬁght it, claim what you know to be true for yourself, and
move to the next step.

If you aren’t able to come up with any answers or conclusions at all, keep reading. The
process of ﬁlling out these worksheets may emphasize a different truth for you — that you
aren’t interested in much of anything these days or that you don’t enjoy things anymore.
If you’re feeling this disengaged and you continue working through the book, you’re likely 
to end up feeling very frustrated. You simply can’t create a career you love when you aren’t
interested in or attracted to activities, things, or people.
This news doesn’t mean that you must give up; it just means that you need to take a slight
detour to wake up your sense of interest. Sometimes, due to life situations, you may get into
such a rut that the range of topics and activities you consider shrinks to the point that you
get bored. After that happens, your excitement meter quits working. This doesn’t have to be
a lifelong sentence, however.
Here are some ideas you can act on to expand your horizons again. As you explore each of
the tactics, don’t worry about how your discoveries apply to your career. Just open your
mind to focus on exploring anything that excites you. After you’re awake again, you can turn
your attention back to your career.
 For the next couple weeks, keep an eye out for any ﬂicker of interest that occurs as 
you live your life. If you feel even the slightest bit of interest, notice what triggered
your attention. Then follow that thread, do an Internet search, read an article, or talk 
to others who share your interest. Keep going as long as your interest is piqued. If you
lose interest, drop that topic and shift your focus to something else.
 Prime the pump a bit by scanning the list of classes at a nearby community college 
or adult education program. You don’t have to take all the classes that appeal to you,
but by familiarizing yourself with the class list, you may discover something that inter-
ests you.
 Take a look at the events pages in your local paper. See if a book signing, performance,
or lecture catches your attention. Attend the event to ﬁnd out more about the subject
or to experience something new.
 Read newspapers and magazines with the sole purpose of ﬁnding topics that interest
you. Clip any articles you ﬁnd and put them in a ﬁle for later reference in Chapter 8.
 Glance through magazines and pull out anything — images, articles, or simply words —
that strikes your fancy. Start a ﬁle of such things for your collection. Later, when your
ﬁle is full, return and sort your items to see what themes show up. After you identify a
theme that particularly interests you, explore it to the fullest.
After you reconnect with things and activities you enjoy, begin taking steps to bring more of
these activities into your life. Continue exploring topics of interest, participate in things you
enjoy, and join a club or organization of people who enjoy what you like.
If you’re still not connecting with any interests, you may need to reach out for support.
Sometimes stress, depression, and medications can mute your interest level. Get support
from a professional if any of these things describe your situation.
Get creative
After you come up with an idea for your future, you may experience feeling stuck because
you don’t see any way to get where you want to go. No matter how you look at your dream
career idea or your dream work situation, you don’t see a way to pull it off.
21
Chapter 2: Opening Yourself to Discovery

First, don’t give up yet! Second, don’t invest too much time looking for a logical answer to
your dilemma. You’ve most likely tried the logical route, and that’s not giving you a work-
able answer. Going down that path again is just going to lead to more frustration. Instead
put on your creative thinking cap and try this brainstorming process.
1. Ask yourself where you’re feeling stuck in your life/career journey.
Do your best to articulate what the problem is. It may be something you crave, a dilemma
about how to get two parts of your life to work together, or a situation you’re tired of
putting up with.
2. Figure out the essence of what you want.
Step back from the speciﬁcs of your problem or situation and get to the true essence 
of your desire. When you resolve this issue, what feeling do you want to have? What’s
your bottom-line need when all is said and done? In the statement of your problem in
Step 1 you most likely focused on the elements of your situation and the circumstances
surrounding that situation that aren’t working. The key to ﬁnding the essence of what
you want in the situation is to shift your focus to how you want to feel. Do you want to
feel calm, powerful, conﬁdent, engaged, or some other emotion? Peel away all the cir-
cumstantial facts of the situation to discover your bottom-line need when all is said
and done. See Step 2 in Figure 2-1 to see some speciﬁc examples of essence statements.
3. List as many creative, outrageous, funny, or unexpected solutions as you can.
Boost your creative juices by putting any perceived or real constraints on your time,
money, and resources out of your mind for a time. You get the best results when you
step into your ideal mind-set as you do your brainstorming.
4. Create a list of possible solutions that might work.
Use the fun and ideal solutions you came up with in Step 3 as a springboard for identi-
fying possible solutions you can work with. As you review your ideas in Step 3 do you
see a theme? Do you see pieces or parts of solutions that might work well together? 
Do you see a solution you hadn’t noticed before? If so, write that one down.
5. Identify one thing you can do to move closer to getting the essence of what
you want.
Start thinking of something — an action, a perspective, a contact, or a research task —
that gets you one step closer to resolving the situation.
Do everything within your power to stay focused on creating the essence of what you want
as you described it in Step 2. The minute you step back into trying to solve the problem you
stated in Step 1, you start running into the speciﬁcs of the situation that keep you locked
into certain perspectives. By focusing on the essence of what you want, you keep a broader,
more ideal perspective that encourages creative thinking and uncovers new solutions you
hadn’t see before.
Patrick, a ﬁnancial planner from Illinois, used this method to brainstorm solutions to two
dilemmas in his life: First, he’s been craving a Hawaiian vacation for a couple years, but he
can’t seem to make it happen. Second, he has a three-hour round trip commute that’s wear-
ing him down. The commute has gotten so draining that it’s affected his relationship with
his family. Read through each step he took in Figure 2-1 to see the brainstorming method in
action. In both cases, he found that focusing on the essence of what he wanted helped him
open up to possibilities he hadn’t considered before.
22
Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

Before you try this brainstorming method to resolve a career-related dilemma, I encourage
you to use Worksheet 2-5 to get a new perspective on a dilemma from your life outside of
your job. Don’t start with an area of your life that you’ve been struggling with for years. 
Try something a bit more approachable, such as how to create more quiet time in your life,
entertain more often, or have more fun on the weekends. After you get familiar with the
process, you can use it for any situation, including dilemmas in your career situation.

s there anything about who you are and your personal style that’s absolutely non-
negotiable? Anything you refuse to give up or sacriﬁce for your job or your career?
As you think about your new career, it’s a given that you bring yourself to the party. In my
opinion, who you are is non-negotiable. For example, if you thrive on being outside and
using your artistic talents, you probably aren’t going to feel very happy sitting in a cubicle
in front of a computer all day. On the ﬂip side, if you love thinking about and working with
computers, the free-form life of an artist might drive you crazy. A career that forces or
requires you to be someone you aren’t is not the career for you. Although you may need
to disregard this advice temporarily if you need to take an interim, short-term position to
make ends meet, in the long run, that kind of job just drains the life right out of you.
In this chapter, you identify elements of yourself that are important to incorporate into
your future career decisions. In Worksheet 3-11 you combine the insights you gained in
Worksheets 3-1 to 3-10 so that all your information is at your ﬁngertips. With this summary
picture of yourself and your needs, you can immediately identify and side-step job opportu-
nities that may force you to give up being who you truly are.
Discovering Traits That Best Describe You
Who you are is comprised of any number of characteristics, traits, and qualities. Some are
likely to be more important to you than others. In fact, some of these qualities may be so
important that they deﬁne you.
Review the list of keywords in Worksheet 3-1 and put an arrow in front of any words that
describe aspects of who you are. This exercise helps you identify the traits that best describe
your personality, which, in turn, helps you solidify your view of yourself. The more you
know about yourself, the more likely you are to identify a career that allows, and even
encourages, you to be yourself at work. If you think of a trait that’s not on the list, be sure 
to add it to your list in Worksheet 3-1.
If you feel stumped, ask your friends and family members for their opinions about your inte-
gral traits. Because they don’t live in your skin and may be less biased, they may have a
better perspective on your personality than you do. But unless you have a really thick skin,
be sure to ask others only for your positive qualities!

After you’ve marked all the words that describe you, narrow the ﬁeld by identifying the six
traits that are essential for you to incorporate into a potential career. The best way to focus
your list is to think about the traits that best describe who you are or are most important
for you to express in your work. If you ﬁnd a couple of traits that seem similar to you, you
can combine them under one trait or come up with a new phrase that combines them. Write
down your choices in Worksheet 3-2 and record any thoughts you have about how you want
to express each trait in your work.
If you want to understand more about how you tick by exploring your personality and per-
sonal style, check out one or both of the following Web sites. The insights you gain can
enhance your list of personality traits in Worksheet 3-2.
 Kiersey Temperament Sorter II (www.advisorteam.com/user/kcs.asp): The

 Enneagram (www.9types.com/): At this site you ﬁnd two free tests to help you deter-
mine your personality type based on the Enneagram system, an ancient system built
on psychological research of high-functioning individuals. By understanding your type,
you gain an appreciation of your personal style, your blind spots, and how you can
interact more effectively with others.
Finding the Values That Mean the Most to You
Values are those beliefs, ideas, and elements of your life that are most important to you.
Depending on who you are, you may ﬁnd that your relationships with family and friends are
crucial to your happiness, or you may ﬁnd competition and adventure are the elements of
life that deﬁne who you are. The more aware you are of your values, the better your chances
of creating a career that truly ﬁts you.
Using the list in Worksheet 3-3, which was developed by Terry Karp, MA, and Mark Guterman,
MA, identify the values that describe the core of who you are. As you read the list, take a
moment to think about how each value does or doesn’t play out in your life. Some values are
likely to be more important to you than others. Put an arrow in front of the values that help
deﬁne who you are.
Review the values you’ve marked and then record your top six values in Worksheet 3-4.
Then next to each value, write a few words or phrases to explain why this value is impor-
tant for you to uphold in your career and life. If you have a value that isn’t part of the
original list, add it to this list.
Clarifying your values is an important step in creating a career that’s a good ﬁt for you.
Imagine the discomfort of ﬁnding a great career only to discover that one of your key
values is consistently violated in that industry. For example, if you love animals and your
life revolves around helping animals, you may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to use your biological training
in companies that test products on animals. Be aware of your own values so you don’t set
yourself up for that type of disappointment!

Chapter 3: Uncovering the Real You

Deciding What Success Means to You
While growing up, you probably relied on your family experience, media messages, and
your peers’ views to deﬁne success for yourself. But now you need to come up with your
own deﬁnition of success. Uncovering how you see success today provides important clues
about the best career for you.
Use the following questions to update and explore your personal deﬁnition of success and
record your thoughts about success in Worksheet 3-5.
 When you ﬁrst started working, how did you deﬁne success? What were you striving
to achieve? What made you feel successful?
 What makes you feel successful now? How has your deﬁnition of success changed
since you ﬁrst started working? What are you trying to create in your life now?

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

Read the answers you just wrote down. Is your deﬁnition of success primarily career-related,
or are you looking at life success — how successful you are as a person? If you value your
home life but base your sense of success solely on your career achievements, the mixed
messages you carry within yourself may create conﬂict, frustration, and feelings of failure
over time.
Bringing your deﬁnition of success into alignment with your true values and current goals
helps you move forward and create what you want in your life and career.
Tapping into Your Dreams and Longings
Another way to access your unique needs is to pay attention to your dreams, longings, and
cravings. Many people think that dreams are desires that never really materialize and that
cravings are a need for something they can’t or shouldn’t have — like chocolate, for instance.
But dreams and cravings are more than that. They are also a window to your desires and
longings, a gateway to understanding your true needs. Knowing your desires and needs
comes in handy when you’re building a dream career.
Whether you dream of traveling, long for a private place to think about your life, or crave a
less stressful schedule, your desires tell you something important about who you are and
what’s important to you. If you combine all three of these wishes together, you may realize
you would love to travel by yourself to a retreat center for a time. Or you might conclude
you want to create a career that allows you time to travel and time for your personal quests.
Although it’s not important to know how to interpret your dreams and desires right now, it
is important to record them as clues to understanding your personal needs. You can tap
into your longings in two ways:
 Pay attention to any craving or wish you have to improve your situation. For example,
you might see that a slight change in how your job works (such as the ability to work
at home one day a week) would make your life easier in some way.
 Notice when you complain or feel frustrated by a situation at work. A complaint pro-
vides a wonderful opportunity to shift your focus from what you don’t want to what
you do want.
The tricky part about describing what you do want is that it often triggers a bit of
worry. You may wonder why you should bother thinking of what you want if you can’t,
at the same time, also ﬁgure out how to get it. Do your best to stay out of this trap by
keeping your focus on what you want, not how you’re going to get there. Worry only
stiﬂes your creativity, buries your desires, and keeps you feeling stuck.
Take a look at Figure 3-1 to see the list that Sally, a computer programmer from California,
created when she described her dreams, longings, and desires. Notice that each of her
entries begins with the phrase “I want,” which helps her stay focused on the positive.
As you move forward in your quest for a new career, you want to make sure that you create a
career that enables you to fulﬁll your professional dreams as well as your personal longings.
Jot down your longings, cravings, and dreams in Worksheet 3-6 after you’ve truly listened to
yourself. If you ﬁnd it hard to tap into your dreams and desires on the spot, be more aware
of your thoughts, complaints, and wishes over the next week or so to see what surfaces as
you go about your daily life.

One more point: Don’t be concerned if one of your longings or dreams contradicts another
one in your list in Worksheet 3-6. Right now you’re recording a variety of things you long for,
which awakens you to what you want. Coming up with ways to create what you want in your
life ultimately evolves out of the thinking and planning you do in the remaining chapters of
this book.

Assessing Whether Your Health 
Impacts Your Career Choices
Working requires a certain degree of physical and mental well-being. If your health is com-
promised in any way, you need to make careful choices about your next career so that you
can be productive in your career and comfortable in your decision.
Does anything about your state of health impact your choice of career? For example:
 A prior illness or physical condition that limits your work activities in some way
 Work-related activities that cause you discomfort or that you must force yourself to do
 Sensitivities or allergies that impact the kinds of environments in which you can
safely work
Use Worksheet 3-7 to stimulate your thinking. Check off the elements that are relevant to
you and then describe how your health may impact your options at work. Being clear about
your body’s working parameters helps you identify the kinds of careers you can explore.

Chapter 3: Uncovering the Real You

Determining What Makes 
Work Meaningful to You
One way to discover meaning in your work is to ask yourself the question “Why do I work?”
At ﬁrst glance, you may say that you work for the money, and unless you’re independently
wealthy, your response is an absolutely viable answer.
If you take a second look, however, you may discover that you work for several other 
important reasons as well. Incorporating these elements into your next career increases the
likelihood that your job will be fulﬁlling and meaningful to you. To begin this exploration,
think about four jobs you have held during your years of employment. In Worksheet 3-8, jot
down what you received from these jobs besides money.
If you’re relatively new to the work world, think of what you’ve gained by doing volunteer
projects, personal projects, or school projects.
Fred, who most recently worked as a realtor in Chicago, found great value in this exercise.
Take a look at Fred’s answers in Figure 3-2 before you begin your own exploration. If you see
something you also gain from your work, feel free to borrow Fred’s phrases. I’m sure he’d be
delighted to help you out.
As you review your notes about various jobs, identify your top six reasons for working —
besides money — and record them in Worksheet 3-9. Take a moment to write why you value
each reason for working.
People who want a meaningful career often want to accomplish something through their
work. Take a look at the phrases in Worksheet 3-10 to spark your creative juices. Put an
arrow next to the statements in the list, or come up with your own phrase, that best com-
pletes the following sentence for you: “Through my work and life I want to. . . .”
Having a clear picture of what gives you meaning in your work allows you, in Chapter 16, 
to assess whether a potential career will successfully fulﬁll your desire for meaning. If, for
example, you want to improve the environment on a global scale, you may not be satisﬁed
working in a job that has a local impact. Knowing your needs allows you to evaluate
whether a particular ﬁeld or profession will be meaningful enough for you.
If you marked more than three phrases in Worksheet 3-10, see if you can come up with a
phrase that best summarizes the kind of meaning you’re looking for.

Envisioning Your Dream Lifestyle
In This Chapter
 Considering the important relationships in your life
 Detailing your ideal lifestyle
 Determining where you want to live
 Making a list of your top desires
A
s you begin building your new career, you want to make sure that the work you create
for yourself supports you in living the life you want. This chapter guides you in detail-
ing how you and your family want to spend time together, what you want to do with your
time when you aren’t working, and where you want to live.
To identify what you value most in life, you complete Worksheets 4-1 through 4-3 and then
summarize the key points in Worksheet 4-4. Having all your lifestyle desires in one place
helps you in Chapter 16 as you ﬁne-tune your priorities, search for work arrangements that
truly work for you, and evaluate possible dream career ideas as you discover them.
Don’t just think of your current life as you ask yourself the questions in this chapter. Think
instead of the life you’d create for yourself and your family if you could. The more you know
about your desired lifestyle, the more proactively you can work to create it.
Looking at How Important Relationships
Impact Your Work
As you consider the various relationships in your life, you most likely notice that in each
relationship you play a particular role that comes with certain responsibilities. As your rela-
tionships change or the individuals in the relationships change, your responsibilities shift 
in response. You’ll probably also realize that when you look at the most important relation-
ships in your life, you also want to spend time enjoying those you love. In some cases this
desire may be enough to inspire you to transform your career.
In this section, take a look at your relationships with the important people (and animals!) in
your life. Identify the kinds of support they need from you and the kind of time you’d like to
spend with them. Thinking this through helps you deﬁne what is non-negotiable for you when
it comes to ﬁnding a career that blends with your personal life.
Bill, a contractor from Indiana, realized that some recent changes in his family situation have
put new demands on his time at work. As part of the sandwich generation, his roles as father
and son are requiring him to rethink his schedule. In Figure 4-1, an excerpt of his worksheet,
you can see that he’s responsible for picking his ﬁrst grader up from after-school care at a

certain time each day. This responsibility means that he needs to arrange for someone to
cover for him at the work site at the end of each day. In addition, his father’s recent heart
attack means Bill is spending more time at his parents’ house, helping out his mother and
making sure the home health staff is providing adequate care for his father. Although this
situation is likely to improve over time, his parents are aging, so he realizes his involvement
is likely to increase over the next few years.
As you read each of the following sections, think about the key relationships in your life.
Then write down your thoughts in the Worksheet 4-1. If you don’t have a partner, a child, 
a strong support network of friends, or a pet now but you want to in the future, be sure 
to account for your desires in Worksheet 4-1. Spell out what is non-negotiable about each 
relationship when it comes to your future career. Be as speciﬁc as you can about how each
relationship inﬂuences how your career is structured.
You don’t have to have all the answers at this point. Your primary goal is to identify how
you’d ideally like to spend time with those you love.
Your partner
Whether you’re married or dating, your relationship requires a certain amount of time and
attention to ﬂourish. Does your work allow you to nurture your relationship? Ask yourself
these questions to ﬁnd out:
 Do you spend enough uninterrupted private time with your partner?
 Do you have enough energy after work to enjoy each other’s company?
 Do you get away together often enough?
 Do you get to have fun together?
 Does your partner have any special needs that require your attention?

 Do you spend the amount of time you’d like with them?
 How is your energy level when you see them?
 Do you take vacations together?
 Are you happy with the activities you share?
 Do your children require any special attention from you?

Chapter 4: Envisioning Your Dream Lifestyle

Time is ﬂeeting. If you want to spend time with your kids, now is the time. Don’t worry about
how you can pull it off. Just use the questions in this section to start thinking about your
true desires regarding your children. The clearer you are about your desires, the easier it is
to ﬁnd a way to create what you want.
Your parents and grandparents
Elder care is more and more of an issue as baby boomers age and their parents and grand-
parents live longer and longer lives.
Look down the road on this one. If you don’t support these members of your family right
now, count your blessings and enjoy the time you have with your parents or grandparents
while they’re thriving, knowing that you may be a caretaker at some point in the hopefully
far distant future. Think about the following questions:
 How do you keep in contact? Is it as frequent as you’d like?
 How frequently do you want or need to visit?
 Do you or might you have any caregiver responsibilities?
 Do you or might you need to move any family members at some point in the future?
 Who else can share in these responsibilities?
Your friends
Having a solid network of friends adds richness to life. Even when built on a good founda-
tion, all friendships need care and feeding to survive. If your friends have moved away or
moved on in different directions, you may need to set aside time to meet new people and
develop bonds with them. When thinking about your support network, consider the follow-
ing questions:
 Do you have a network of friends you can count on?
 Do you spend time with them on a fairly regular basis?
 Do you keep in touch?
 Do you enjoy your friends?
 Are you making new friends?
 Are you accepting social invitations?
Your pets
Pets are great companions, and if you share your life with animals, you know that they
require your time and attention. Think about how your pets affect your work life:
 How long can you be away from home at any one time?
 Does having a pet impact your business travel?
 Does your pet have any health needs that impact your work?
 What kind of exercise does your pet need?
 Do you spend the time you’d like with your pet?

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

Describing Your Desired Lifestyle
Although your relationships have a role in deﬁning your life, other factors may inﬂuence
your career choices and decisions as well. Each of the personal life factors in the ﬁrst column
of Worksheet 4-2 may impact your career in terms of the amount of time and money you want
to devote to these endeavors. In some cases, you may be able to ﬁt these activities around 
a full-time, 8-to-5 job and be perfectly satisﬁed. In other cases, you may wish you had more
time, more ﬂexibility, or more funds to enjoy the activity to the extent you dream of.
Now’s your chance! By ﬁguring out what you truly value, you can factor that activity into
your decisions about your next career and how it’s structured. Use the second column in
Worksheet 4-2 to describe your personal activities. Then in the third and fourth columns,
indicate how each activity is likely to impact your time commitments at work and your 
need for cash!
Think about your ideal here. Don’t get dragged down by what you think is feasible in your
current situation. Articulate your needs as clearly as possible. You return to them again in
Chapter 16 as you blend your ideal career with your ideal lifestyle.
 Your home: One source of pride and joy in life is often a place called home. How much
time do you want to devote to caring for and enhancing your home? Is it important for
you to take care of your home all by yourself or would you really like to bring someone
in to help you out on a weekly basis or on a project-by-project basis? If you don’t enjoy
where you live, is purchasing a new home or moving to a different place part of your
ideal picture? Remember that this exercise isn’t about what works now, but about how
you’d like it to be in the future.
 Your faith: Your devotion to your faith also deﬁnes your lifestyle. Depending on your
commitment to your beliefs, your activities may extend beyond your time of worship 
in the form of volunteering, committee work, and outreach. Consider how your com-
mitments might impact how your future career is structured.
 Your volunteer work: For some people, the time they spend helping others deﬁnes
them. Do you have a cause you feel strongly about? Are you able to devote the time,
money, and energy to helping others in the way you’d like? If you had more time, would
you contribute to a cause that’s meaningful to you? Would you volunteer through a
nonproﬁt, a church project, or your child’s school?
 Your hobbies and interests: Do you have a personal passion that is important to you?
Think about how you might structure your work so that you have more time and
energy to devote to your interests. Begin by thinking about whether your current
career allows you to pursue your interests to the degree you’d like. For example:
• If you’re a nature photographer, do you have the ﬂexibility in your schedule to
travel?
• If you love to water ski, can you get to the lake frequently enough to do what 
you love?
• If you like to quilt, do you have enough time after work to devote to your craft?
If you want to explore ways to transform your hobby or interest into a career, check
out Chapter 7, which is all about identifying your passions.
 Your fun time: No matter what you do for fun, you want to make sure you factor in
enough time for activities that relax and entertain you. Think going to the movies,
taking a vacation, entertaining, going out to eat, strolling through a park, or curling up
with a good book. Whether your needs for enjoyment are simple or extravagant, think
about the impact they have on your career.

Chapter 4: Envisioning Your Dream Lifestyle

Considering Where You Live
Sometimes the place you live has a huge impact on your career options. Although becoming
more conscious about how your location inﬂuences or limits your career choices may be
scary, in the end you have more power because you know the realities you face. For example,
if you realize that the career options in your current location are dismal, you may choose to
relocate or to create a multifaceted career that allows you to take advantage of what’s possi-
ble in your area.
Several factors may inﬂuence the economy in your area and your career options. Start by
thinking about the following issues:
 Weather: Do any cyclical weather patterns impact your work options? For example,
your area may experience dramatic highs and lows in weather, such as extremely cold
winters or fry-an-egg-on-the-sidewalk summers, that inﬂuence the economy of your
community during those times. Or you may live in a temperate climate that encourages
a well-balanced economy throughout the year.

 Economy: Does your local economy have any unique features that deﬁne or limit your
career options? For example, do any of the following characteristics seem to describe
your area?
• Limited variety of industries in the local area
• Slow economy
• Recreation or tourist economic base
• Rural area
• Small town
• Seasonal economy
 Cost of living: Does the cost of living in your area change your career choices at all?
For example, does your mortgage or the cost of fuel require that you make such a large
income that your career choices are limited?
 Travel: Does your commute or access to transportation inﬂuence your career choices?
For example, would you accept a tempting job offer even if it increased your commute
beyond reason? Are you far enough away from a decent airport that extensive business
travel is out of the question?
 Communications: Does your local phone system or Internet access have an impact on
your career choices? For example, if you live in a rural area, does the cost for high-
speed Internet connections and some voice communication options impact your
choice of career?
You may think of other local factors that limit or enhance your career options. Use the
space in Worksheet 4-3 to jot down the characteristics of your location that have an inﬂu-
ence on your career options.

Chapter 4: Envisioning Your Dream Lifestyle

After you consider the various characteristics that deﬁne the area where you live, take a
step back to look at the big picture for a moment. Think about why you live where you do.
For example, are you living there for one of the following reasons?
 By default: Because you grew up or went to school there and ended up staying
 By circumstances: Because your spouse relocated to the area, your elderly parent lives
there, or your child needs to attend a school in the area
 By choice: Because you absolutely love living where you do
Would you rather live in more than one place? Have you always dreamed of having two
homes, living in a RV and moving whenever you desire, traveling frequently, accompanying
your partner whenever and wherever he or she travels, or seeing your long-distance partner
more frequently and for longer periods of time? If you need this kind of ﬂexibility to make
the most of your desired lifestyle, consider a portable career, one that allows you to bring in
an income from wherever you are. You may want to explore being a writer or editor, running
an e-commerce site, or becoming a Web site or graphic designer. Another option may be to
create a career that capitalizes on the locations you visit. Perhaps you travel to an area with
a unique craft or product that you can import to your area.
If you aren’t happy with where you live, ﬁnding your dream career right now isn’t going to
help much. No matter how good that job is, you won’t enjoy it because you aren’t content
with your living situation. Your best bet is to shift gears for the moment to focus your atten-
tion on gaining clarity about where you want to live. Make a list of what isn’t working about
your current living location and another list of what you’d like to have. Do you have any ideas
about where you’d like to live? Talk with the other members of your family to determine
their needs and desires. Start investigating your target geographic areas by visiting the
Quintessential Careers Web site (www.quintcareers.com/researching_companies.html)
and scrolling down to the Key Tools for Conducting Country Research. After you have an
idea where you’d like to live, become familiar with the local economy and job market to
understand what opportunities exist there. Although it’s not time to make any sudden
moves, you’re ready to reconnect with the question of your next career. With your ideal
living location in mind, you have a much better chance of creating a career/life picture that
meets your needs.
Recording What’s Most Important 
to You at Home
Take a couple of minutes to review what you’ve written in the worksheets in this chapter:
 Worksheet 4-1: How Your Relationships Impact Your Work
 Worksheet 4-2: Factors That Deﬁne Your Personal Life
 Worksheet 4-3: Location Factors That Inﬂuence Your Career
Then write down ﬁve factors in your personal life that, if resolved, would allow you to love
your life and your work more than you do now. These ﬁve factors, which you should enter
into the relevant section in Worksheet 4-4, can help you evaluate potential career opportuni-
ties to see whether they’re a good ﬁt or whether they would produce too much conﬂict to
consider.
Be as upfront as you possibly can be about what you want and need to feel fulﬁlled. Even if
you don’t or can’t get all that you want, acknowledging and voicing what you truly want are
the best ways to move your life and career in the direction you desire. Chapters 16 and 17
help you integrate your ideal career ideas with your ideal lifestyle.

 Visualizing your perfect work schedule
 Figuring out how much money you need
 Deciding on beneﬁts
 Envisioning the ideal work arrangement
M
ore work arrangements exist now than in any other time in history. You can work as 
a full-time employee, a contract employee, or a sole proprietor. As an employee, you
may ﬁnd your employer offers ﬂextime or telecommuting options. As an entrepreneur, you
create your own schedule and workplace. Over time, you can create a blend of employment
and self-employment or switch back and forth between those options as opportunities knock.
In recent years, companies have come up with a variety of innovative, cost-effective work
arrangements to attract and retain talented employees, handle explosive growth, and weather
unpredictable downturns. Understanding and remaining open to the options allow you to
move into this ﬂuid economy with more conﬁdence and less fear.
The structure of your workweek and how you are paid impact how well your life and work
blend together. Understanding what’s now possible in the work world and gaining clarity
about what works best for you puts you in a good position to make informed decisions
about your future and to negotiate whatever you need to make your life work.
Making the Worksheets Work for You
Each worksheet in this chapter helps you explore and deﬁne what you want your work
arrangement to look like. I encourage you to approach each worksheet with a sense of dis-
covery. Explore what’s possible in the world of work in general while paying close attention
to what works best for you. As you work through each worksheet, check off the items that
seem to ﬁt your needs or that intrigue you in some way.
In some worksheets you may ﬁnd it easy to say, “Yes, that one works best for me.” Other
topics, however, may leave you saying, “Ho-hum” because they don’t appear, on the surface,
to matter that much to you. Even if you don’t seem to care one way or the other about a
topic, think it through the best you can and take a stand. You never know what clarity and
insight some additional thinking on the subject may bring you.

As you complete the worksheets in this chapter, if you hear yourself saying, “I guess I could
do that,” stop yourself on the spot. The second those words form in your mind, you’re get-
ting ready to settle, trying to force-ﬁt yourself into something that could work but is not the
best option for you. At this stage of the game, keep your focus on your ideal. Allow your
mind to explore as many new options, new combinations, and new avenues as you can.
Exploration brings to mind new solutions you haven’t yet dreamed of.
If you feel drawn to work for yourself, answer the questions in this chapter as thoroughly as
you can. Although the way you implement these ideas as a self-employed person may be a
little different than what happens in corporate or governmental settings, the concepts them-
selves are still relevant to you and may stimulate new ways of thinking about your business
structure. For additional thoughts on starting a business, see Chapter 19.
If you haven’t already done so, I recommend that you take a few minutes to ﬁll out the 
worksheets in Chapters 3 and 4 to help focus your thinking about the life you want your
job to support. If you’ve already worked through these chapters, take a quick look at
Worksheets 3-11 and 4-4 to bring your personal needs to mind.
Determining Your Ideal Work Schedule
If you think a 40-hour workweek is your only option, think again! Companies now offer a
variety of work arrangements that give employees the opportunity to take on more ﬂexible
work schedules. Flexible schedules help employees reduce the stress and strain of balanc-
ing work and home, which in the long run is good business for the company. By offering
ﬂexible work arrangements, companies are better able to recruit and retain good employ-
ees, reduce absenteeism, and increase shareholder returns through increased employee
productivity, creativity, and satisfaction.
Before you attempt to pin down which schedule options appeal to you, use the questions in
Worksheet 5-1 to help you deﬁne your ideal work schedule. Without calculating anything or
trying to ﬁgure out the right label for what you want, answer the questions in the worksheet
according to what works best for you and your body.
After you’ve taken one pass through Worksheet 5-1, take another look with a different ﬁlter.
Ask yourself how you may need to modify your ideal schedule to incorporate what works
best for your family, pets, and social life. (Not to mention that you’d like to be home in time
to watch Oprah every afternoon.) Note any conﬂicts or inconsistencies that arise as you
compare what you need for yourself and what your family needs from you and your sched-
ule. Don’t worry about resolving these conﬂicts at this point; you don’t yet have all the
information you need to do so. Chapter 16 helps you sort out these conﬂicts and create
workable solutions.
Based on what you discover about your needs and desires regarding time at work in
Worksheet 5-1, explore your scheduling options. As you review the options in Worksheet 5-2,
put a checkmark next to any scheduling options that help you meet your needs and those 
of your family.
Even if it doesn’t feel like the various options in Worksheet 5-2 are possible, don’t strike
them from your mind just yet. With some proper prior planning and a well-written proposal,
you can forge new trails in your company and community. If you want some assistance, visit
the WorkOptions.com Web site (www.workoptions.com), which can take you through the
step-by-step process of preparing your case.

In addition to a wider variety of work schedules to choose from, the new world of work also
offers a number of contract formats.
Read each option in Worksheet 5-3 and put a checkmark next to any that appeal to you.
Consider each of the possibilities, even if they seem out of reach to you at the moment.
The work world is far more ﬂuid than you may have expected when you started working.
Although you may be most comfortable with the stability of a full-time job, the realities of
the current economy may require you to step beyond your comfort zone to take on a short-
term contract or part-time job on occasion. Taking such opportunities allows you to get
your foot in the door — and you never know when the company’s budget or strategic plan
may open up to create a full-time opening. Even if a new position doesn’t open up, you’ve
had money coming in the door and you’ve acquired a new set of skills and experience to
strengthen your resume and keep it current.

Chapter 5: Figuring Out How to Structure Your Work

Your Contract Possibilities
❑ Full-time
Work 40 or more hours per week as a full-fledged employee of the company receiving full pay
and benefits.
❑ Part-time
Work less than 40 hours a week by shortening your days or your workweek. Expect your pay
to be commensurate with the hours you work and verify your workload is cut to match your
reduced hours. Depending on the company’s policies, you may or may not receive benefits.
❑ Job-share
Share a full-time job with another employee by splitting up the time worked each week, the
pay, and the vacation time. You may act interchangeably and share the duties equally or split
the duties according to each person’s expertise.
❑ Gradual
 retirement
Work a reduced number of hours as soon as you become eligible for retirement. Depending
on the arrangement, your reduced hours may be for a limited time or for an extended period
of time. 
❑ Temporary
 employee/
 contractor
Work through a staffing firm or temporary agency, which places you in companies to work as
long as they need you, whether it’s for a couple days or several months. You can expect the
staffing firm to take care of your taxes and to offer you benefits of some sort. At the end of
your stint, you may have the option to convert to a permanent status depending on the
company’s needs and your interest. This option allows you to check out a company and find
out whether you want to work there on a long-term basis. 
❑ Consultant
Contract with a company to work for a specified length of time or on a specific project. You
may be asked to sign up for another round if they like your work or the project is not yet
completed. As an independent, you’re required to handle your own taxes and provide your
own benefits. 
❑ Freelancer
Work independently doing projects for one company or several companies at once. You may
work very hard for several months and then have a few lighter months; it all depends on the
jobs and clients you find and take on, over which you have total control.
❑ Self-
 employed
You have no contract at all — except to yourself! Run your own business to provide a product
or service directly to your customers. Your tasks expand to include marketing, sales,
accounting, fulfillment, and shipping, which means you wear and juggle many hats every day.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

Getting Paid on Your Terms
Obviously, one of the key reasons you work is to make an income and have access to bene-
ﬁts that make your life easier and less stressful. As you consider changing careers, being
aware of your income and beneﬁt requirements puts you in a strong position to negotiate 
or create what you need in your next career.
One crucial number to know as you enter into your career change is the income you need to
live the way you want to live. This number isn’t necessarily the amount you live on now, but
includes the money you need to do the things you’ve always wanted to do — whether it’s
putting a ﬁsh pond in your backyard, taking an annual ﬂy-ﬁshing trip to Montana, or starting
the savings account you’ve been talking about for the last decade or so.
Use Worksheet 5-4 to make a ballpark estimate of what it takes for you to live comfortably.
As you develop various career options in Part IV, return to this calculation to assess whether
your target career provides you with an annual income that meets your needs.
After you ﬁgure out what your annual income needs to be, divide your estimated annual
income by 12 to determine your monthly income requirement. You’ll also probably want to
talk with your accountant to understand your tax situation and how that impacts your take-
home pay. If you’re interested in looking to the future, complete Worksheet 5-4 for each of
the next three years. This result shows you how your income needs are likely to change
over the years.
If you’re thinking of relocating, you may need to adjust your calculations for the cost of
living in the new area. To get an idea of these costs, visit the Salary.com Web site at www.
salary.com and look for the Cost-of-Living Wizard to determine the power of your salary 
in your new area.
Your Annual Income Needs
Your Estimate
1. What do you expect to spend to live your life next year? Base your calculations on what
 it cost you to live last year. If you use a bookkeeping program, this number should be
 easy to find. If not, scan your check register and credit card statements to see how
 much you spent. You can also look at your total income last year and add in credit card
 charges that you made but couldn’t pay off during the last year.
2. What amount of money do you need to save this year for large purchases you expect to
 make in the next few years?
 For example, think about any pending major purchases, like a car or a house, or other
 large cash outlays, like college tuition for yourself or your children.
$
$
3. How much debt would you like to pay off next year? 
 Consider outstanding credit card balances, loans from family members, car loans, and
 equity lines of credit.
$
4. How much would you like to be able to put away into a savings account or investment 
 account each year? Think about establishing an emergency fund, vacation account, 
 college funds for your children, investment account, and retirement plans. 
$
5. How much additional income do you need to enhance your life and fulfill your dreams 
 next year?
 For example, if you want a different day care situation, factor in the added cost. If you 
 want to travel more frequently, include a travel budget. If you plan to have a child, 
 estimate the additional costs for at least the first year or two.

Chapter 5: Figuring Out How to Structure Your Work

Another useful number to have in your back pocket is the least amount of money you could
live on for one year. I’m not suggesting that this number is helpful for everyone. However,
sometimes paring back your lifestyle and decreasing your need for income can open up inter-
esting options that give you the freedom to step into a new, more fulﬁlling life. For example,
knowing your minimal income gives you added decision-making power if you ever decide
you want to start a business (see Chapter 19), cut back your hours, return to school (see
Chapter 19), or take a sabbatical to travel. To determine your minimal income needs, care-
fully evaluate all of your monthly expenses and socializing costs to see what you could do
without while making a transition to a new career or lifestyle.
In addition to considering how much money you need to make, consider how often and in
what form you need to get paid. Receiving pay for the work you do is no longer always as
simple as earning an hourly wage or an annual salary. Companies use a variety of methods
to pay employees, temporary or contract workers, independent consultants, expert consult-
ants, and freelancers. Some methods of payment are more consistent and predictable than
others in terms of the dollar amount and the expected pay period. For example, you could
get paid by the project, by how much you sell, or based on the company’s proﬁts.
As you read each description in Worksheet 5-5, put a check mark next to any form of pay-
ment you would consider in your next career.

Advice on the home page to check out the base salary and stock options sections.
Matching Benefits to Your Needs
Although at this point you can’t know for sure what beneﬁts any future employer may offer,
you can determine the beneﬁts that are most important to you and your family. If you’re
considering self-employment or you plan to work for short-term stints at various compa-
nies, this exercise proves extremely important, because you won’t have a company providing
your beneﬁts. Instead, you must understand your needs thoroughly enough to search out
ways to provide for the beneﬁts that you and your family need.
Your Payment Options
❑ Hourly
Get a check for the hours you worked during the pay period.
❑ Salary
Get a check on a regular, dependable basis for a consistent amount each pay period.
❑ By project
Receive payment for work done on a project. May be paid at predetermined milestones
as progress is made.
❑ Commission
Earn a percentage of everything you sell. Sometimes combined with a base salary. 
❑ Royalties
Earn a percentage on the sale of something you wrote or created.
❑ Bonus
Receive an extra check as a reward after the completion of a big project, at the end of
the year, after cost-savings goals are met, when statistical improvements are made in a
project’s quality, or for signing on with a new company.
❑ Stock options
Have the option to buy company stocks at a fixed price. Your eligibility for this may be
influenced by your tenure in the company, your level, and the rules that govern the
company’s stock program. Do your research to understand how this complex payment
option works in the company.
❑ Profit sharing
Share in the profits of the company. The amount you receive depends on how well the
company did during the year.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

If you currently get your beneﬁts through your spouse’s employment, you may be tempted
to skip this worksheet. Think again. In the current economic landscape, you have no guaran-
tee that you’ll always have access to these beneﬁts. Your spouse could be laid off, or the
company could be sold to another company that changes the mix of beneﬁts. You need to
know exactly what beneﬁts are required to cover your family’s needs so that, if required,
you can cover these beneﬁts yourself.
In Worksheet 5-6, put a check mark next to any beneﬁts you feel are relevant to you and your
family. Don’t concern yourself with where the beneﬁts will come from. By having a clear pic-
ture of the beneﬁts you need, whether they come through a company or by purchasing them
directly, you can assess whether your target careers are a good ﬁt for you and your family.
Your Benefits
❑ Medical insurance
Covers visits to your doctor and catastrophic health problems.
❑ Dental insurance
Covers visits to your dentist.
❑ Eye care insurance
Covers visits to your eye doctor.
❑ Long-term and
 short-term disability
Provides replacement income if you should become incapacitated due to illness or
accident. This benefit is most important if you have children or a mortgage.
❑ Severance package Provides money that allows you to transition into your next job. Finding out whether
you have the benefit during the hiring process might seem awkward, but it’s better to
know how the system works before any sparks fly.
❑ Life insurance
Protects the financial well-being of your family in case of your death.
❑ Child care
Provides assistance to employees with children. Options vary by company, from an
on-site or near-site child care center that is run or supported by the company to
financial subsidies, resources and referral system, options for sick-child care,
summer programs, and back-up care.
❑ Elder care
Includes a combination of resources, referrals, seminars, support groups, and long-
term insurance for family members to help employees who must care for elderly or ill
parents or grandparents. This benefit is gaining popularity as employees take on
more and more caregiver responsibilities.
❑ Employee 
 assistance program
Refers you to a counselor if you’re wrestling with personal issues that are distracting
you from your work. After a few appointments, you may be referred to a counselor
who is covered through your medical insurance.
❑ Retirement
Establishes a retirement fund, such as a 401(k), that allows you to contribute pre-tax
dollars to your next egg. The company may match your contribution dollar for dollar.
If you’re close to retirement age and expect to be with the company when you retire,
ask about other benefits, such as health insurance, that come to you upon retirement.
Make sure to ask how long before you qualify to receive retirement benefits.
❑ Parking/commuting
Provides on-site parking, subsidized off-site parking, or tokens for commuters.
❑ Convenience or
 concierge services
Eliminates tasks from your to-do list and frees up your time and your mind to work
more productively. Independent contractors hired by your company provide a variety
of services that may include dry cleaning, housecleaning, take-home meals, pet care,
on-site chair massage, legal services, financial consulting, and social outings.
Although you generally pay for the services you use, the peace of mind and
simplification of your life may make them worthwhile. 
❑ Expense account
Gives you a per diem amount or charge card you use to handle expenses while
you’re away from the office. Depending on your work, you may be assigned a
company car, as well.
❑ Community service
 opportunities
Allows you to take off work hours to volunteer through corporate volunteer programs
or more informal arrangements.
❑ Health club
Gives you access to an on-site gym or a full or discounted membership to a
nearby gym.

Recording Your Ideal Work Arrangement
Now that you’re aware of the wide range of possibilities that exist when it comes to how
time and money can work in your career, start creating your ideal picture in Worksheet 5-7.
Take a look back at each worksheet in this chapter and pull forward the key features of your
ideal work arrangement. Factor in your needs and priorities and those of your family as you
describe each feature laid out in Worksheet 5-7.
If your ideal proﬁle looks like a stable, 8-to-5 job with a guaranteed two-week vacation, I
encourage you to take another look at this chapter to see how you might expand your
options a bit. The days of the secure, career for life are numbered. Even if you had a stable
career up until now, don’t expect the next ten years to look like the past. In the future, you
may have periods of time when you work as an independent consultant, a contract employee,
or in a virtual work situation where the majority of your contact with colleagues is long dis-
tance. To thrive in the new economy, you must build some ﬂexibility into your picture. If
you don’t, the current economic realities and trends may do it for you.
Expect to have some loose ends at this stage of the process. You don’t yet know enough to
tie up all the details. It’s okay. In fact, this is a good opportunity to practice sitting with your
confusion and allowing the pieces of your puzzle to fall into place as they come to you. If
you see obvious inconsistencies or conﬂicts, hang tight and sort them out in Chapter 16.

In This Chapter

 Looking at the purpose, reach, and location of your company
 Deﬁning your ideal workspace and dress code
 Identifying the kinds of people you enjoy working with
 Creating a proﬁle of your ideal workplace
You spend anywhere from 40 to 60 percent of your waking hours at work. With all the
time you spend working, you need to work in a place that aligns with who you are — 
at least you do if you want to be happy with your career. Each worksheet in this chapter
helps you discern the kind of company, work area, and work community that best ﬁt your
professional and personal needs and wants.
In Worksheet 6-13 at the end of the chapter, you review everything you’ve checked off in
Worksheets 6-1 through 6-12 to create a proﬁle that best describes your ideal workplace.
Even if a question in one of the worksheets doesn’t seem to matter to you one way or the
other, force yourself to take a stand on the question anyway. Doing so ensures that you
fully consider all of the issues that play a part in selecting a fulﬁlling career. At the same
time, mark only those choices that truly excite and intrigue you. “I could do that” is not a
valid response; thinking this way leads you off the path of ﬁnding out how you really want
to work.
The Kind of Company
When you think of working for a company, you probably think of large, publicly held compa-
nies, without realizing all the other options that exist.
As you read about the culture inherent in each kind of company listed in Worksheet 6-1,
check off the types of companies that appeal to you.

The Company Size
The size of a company also impacts its inherent culture. Typically, the larger the company,
the more layers of management and bureaucratic structure you must contend with to get
results. In this kind of setting, you probably work in a formal, more impersonal environment
than someone who works in a smaller company. Smaller companies often have a more
casual feel to them, allowing more access to the top brass and more ﬂexibility to try new
strategies.
As you read Worksheet 6-2, imagine yourself in each setting and check off the company
sizes that seem to ﬁt your needs. Use your prior experiences and what you know about
yourself from Chapter 3 to make these decisions.
Type of Company
❑ Not-for-profit
Fulfills its mission by supporting a cause in a way that makes the company exempt
from paying taxes. Because funding usually comes from grants and fundraising 
efforts, employees may need to be creative to accomplish the company’s goals.
❑ Education
Educates people of any age. Schools and academia have a culture that values 
learning and teaching above all else. The schedule matches the school year, which 
often means long interim breaks. 
❑ Government
Provides services to citizens through government agencies based on programs 
established by legislation. The culture is fairly stable, although changes may occur 
when leadership changes.
❑ Public company
Strives to satisfy the stockholders and customers by providing successful services
and products. All records are open to the public, which gives you a clearer under-
standing of how the company is doing before and after you start working there. 
Public companies tend to be mature and larger in size than other kinds of companies.
❑ Start up, pre-IPO
 (Initial Public 
 Offering)
Pushes to create a viable product, capture market share, and eventually go public. 
Start-ups by their very nature (being in the initial stages of building a business) tend 
to be very fast-paced with a fair amount of scrambling to stay ahead of the wave. 
Some have funding or venture capital support, which creates additional stability. 
❑ Virtual company
Run by a number of people in various geographic locations. Although they may meet
in person occasionally, the bulk of their interactions with each other and with
customers are done virtually through various forms of technology. 
❑ Privately-held
 company
Owned by an individual or a small group of private investors and has no intention of
going public. The company’s culture and product lines are likely to be fairly stable.
The degrees of flexibility, employee participation, and experimentation depend on the
owners and their relationships with the staff. 
❑ Family-owned
Owned and operated by one family that may have founded the business. Family
dynamics and traditions are usually a part of the in-house politics. 
❑ Partner-owned
Run by two people. Assessing the stability and sanity of their relationship gives you
an idea of the culture of the company. 
❑ Home-based
Run out of someone’s home. It’s likely to be comfortable and casual, though may be 
somewhat cramped and prone to family-related interruptions and crises.

best companies to work for in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.
Although a big company used to mean that your job was secure, shifts in the economic real-
ity mean that your job could be lifted out from under you regardless of the company’s size.
Keep your skills up-to-date, your network in place, and a clear picture of where your career
is headed. Sometimes a surprise departure from one company brings unexpected opportu-
nities from other corners.
Small businesses have an unbelievably large impact on the economy. Twenty-four million
small businesses in the United States make up 99.7 percent of the employers. These busi-
nesses employ over 50 percent of the people in the private work force and have generated
three-quarters of all new positions over the last decade. In addition to contributing the major-
ity of innovations created in the United States, they also are a great source of employment
for ﬁrst-time employees, older workers, and women. When you start looking at potential
employers, don’t count small businesses out.
The Company Culture
Although the company size has a hand in how your experience of work plays out, don’t
underestimate the impact that the overall company culture has on your life. Becoming
aware of the variables that make up a company’s culture allows you to ask your interview-
ers crucial questions to verify that their culture matches your career goals and personal
needs.
If you’re considering a future as a sole proprietor, you create your company culture from
scratch. Allow the characteristics in the following list to give you insights about how you
want to position your company culture for yourself, your clients, and your customers.
In Worksheet 6-3, place an arrow next to each characteristic you’d use to describe your
ideal company culture. This is not the time to restrain yourself. Be as idealistic and opti-
mistic as possible as you use this worksheet to identify the culture you want in your next
career.
Company Size
❑ Sole proprietor
One person runs the show — you. You play the roles of Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Bottle Washer and everything in between. Graphic designers, career 
counselors, and travel agents who work solo are examples.
❑ Partnership
Two individuals come together to form and run a business such as a restaurant, a 
retail store, or a consulting company.
❑ Micro business
Four or fewer employees run the business together. Typical examples are a 
gardening service, a cart-vending business, a booth at a farmers market, and an 
online business venture.
❑ Small company
Fewer than 1,000 employees. Scitor, Fenwick & West, and David Weekley Homes
are examples.
❑ Mid-size company
Between 1,000 and 10,000 employees. Examples are Genentech, Adobe Systems, 
and Pella. 
❑ Large company
Between 10,000 and 100,000 employees. Hewlett Packard, Southwest Airlines,
Deloitte and Touche, Merck, Four Seasons Hotels, and Wegmans Food Markets
are examples.
❑ Gigantic company
Over 100,000 employees. Examples are Wal-Mart, FedEx, and McDonald’s.

The Purpose of the Company
A company that manufactures products differs signiﬁcantly from one that conducts
research. A company’s purpose inﬂuences its culture, the kinds of jobs it offers, its orga-
nizational structure, and its language. As you think about your options, you may realize
that you feel at home in one company and like a ﬁsh out of water in another.
As you read Worksheet 6-5, notice how you may feel when you think about providing these
products and services to customers. Use check marks to indicate any company purposes
that match your interests. Even if you don’t know the speciﬁcs of each kind of environment,
pay attention to your initial response to each description. Those that seem interesting may
be worth exploring further (see Chapter 14 for more information). Feel free to mark as many
as work for you.

Client companies are helped in an intangible way through legal assistance,

The Company’s Reach
Each company reaches out to its customers, whether they’re local clients who come into
the shop or global customers whose main contact is over the Web. Think about the kinds 
of contact you wish to have with your customers or clients. Do you want face-to-face 
conversations? Would you prefer phone contact? Even if you don’t work directly with cus-
tomers, this question is important because the way the business reaches its customers 
may impact the work pace, the hours of operations, the technology used, and the extent 
to which you travel.
Look at the options in Worksheet 6-6 to get a sense of which kind of experience works for
you. Mark as many as you like.
The Location
The location of your company deﬁnitely impacts you, your commute, your ability to get
things done on your lunch hour, and your general comfort level. Next to each factor in
Worksheet 6-7, spell out your ideal picture for each element.
If you want to run your own business, the decisions you make about your location depend
on a number of additional factors, including zoning, foot trafﬁc, availability, and rents. If you
think you want to work from home, your answers to the questions in Worksheet 6-7 can help
you verify your desire. For more information on starting your own business, see Chapter 19.
Traveling for business, whether occasionally or constantly, can be exciting, disruptive,
exhilarating, and exhausting all at once. If you want travel to be part of your career, take
some time to think about how far and how often you want to travel. Clearly visualizing your
ideal travel schedule helps you make good decisions, when the time comes, about the ﬁt
between you and a prospective job. Consider your personal and family priorities as you set
your intentions.
Company Reach
❑ Local
Business focuses on local clients and their needs, which means someone working 
in this business is likely to have face-to-face interactions with clients. 
❑ Statewide
Business and operations are located in one state. 
❑ Regional
Company serves a particular geographic region. 
❑ National
Company focuses attention on one country. A company this large may have 
branches or departments across the country, which means you may have co-workers
you work with only online, by phone, or during brief visits. 
❑ Global
Company has a presence throughout the world with its products and services as 
well as its operations. Note: Any Web-based company has a global scope. Most if 
not all interactions with clients are likely to be via e-mail, fax, instant message, 
phone, and videoconferencing.

The Work Area
Productivity is the name of the game when it comes to work. Do you know what characteris-
tics you need in your personal work space to be efﬁcient, productive, and fulﬁlled? Although
you may not always get exactly what you want, knowing your ideal work area requirements
may help you steer away from a job with an ofﬁce space that is deﬁnitely counterproductive
for you. For example, if the thought of sitting in a cubicle ﬁve days a week makes your skin
crawl, you may need to look beyond the traditional work space to ﬁnd happiness.
Worksheet 6-8 lists elements of your personal work space that can enhance or detract from
your productivity and satisfaction. Check the ones that strike a chord in you and add any
notes to clarify and specify your needs in more detail.

If you notice as you ﬁll out Worksheets 6-7 and 6-8 that working in a closed building of any
variety stresses you out, this section may offer valuable clues about your next career. Would
you prefer to work outside? Do you need to move around at will? Would traveling to several
locations throughout the week help? Whatever you do, pay attention to your body’s response
to help you make the right decisions.
The Dress Code
If your comfort or ability to express yourself are tantamount to your happiness, how you
dress for work each day may prove to be very important to you. If not, you may consider
skipping Worksheet 6-9. Before you settle into thinking that you must wear what you’ve
always worn to work, think about what really makes you happy.
Place a check mark in Worksheet 6-9 next to the dress code that makes you most comfort-
able. If several options appeal to you depending on your tasks for the day, choose the three
that “suit” you best.
Working with the Right People
The people you interact with at work inﬂuence how much you enjoy your job, whether
they’re your co-workers, those who come in-house to perform tasks, or your manager.
Although you can’t always choose your colleagues, you can determine the kinds of relation-
ships that work best for you. After you know what you’re looking for, if you spot a problem
right off the bat in an interview, you know that job isn’t for you. For example if you ﬁnd the
hiring manager is overbearing when talking with his assistant or your potential co-workers
are a bit snobbish when interacting with you, you may want to think twice about joining this
work team. If they’re behaving this way when they should be on their best behavior, just
imagine what it might be like to work with them on a full-time basis!
If you want to work solo, the term co-worker may seem a little off base. In your situation,
your co-workers are your colleagues, professionals in your trade association, or people you
team up with to work on a particular project.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Your Career Change 

In an interviewing situation, evaluating your potential co-workers may be hard to do. You
may not meet all of them, and if you do, the interaction may be so superﬁcial that you 
can’t make a true assessment of the ﬁt. If you’re switching jobs or careers within the same
company, your prospective co-workers may play a bigger role in your decision-making
process because you may have had an opportunity to interact with them on prior occasions.
In either case, trust your intuitive gut sense of your prospective co-workers. Chapter 19
gives you pointers on how to evaluate a position based on the information you gain during
an interview.
In this day and age, the people who make up your work team may not be employed by the
same company you are. Understanding the various roles people have as they contribute to
a company helps you understand the interactions within the company.
The following roles are relevant whether you work in a large company or on your own:
 Expert consultants: Hired to use their expertise to resolve speciﬁc problems or situa-
tions. Often their role and the work they do is dictated by the proposal they themselves
create to land the job. Whether they’re self-employed or employed by a consulting
ﬁrm, they may work on other projects for other companies while working on a project
for your company.
 Freelancers: Complete their piece of the project independently and may submit their
work electronically, although they may interact with others to discover what they need
to know to get the job done. They typically work on a number of projects for different
customers simultaneously.
 Independent consultants: Come into the company for the duration of a project
as needed to provide a key skill or piece of knowledge that no one within the com-
pany has.
 Temporary employees/contract employees: Fill in on a short-term basis when a regu-
lar employee is out or there’s a project crunch and no one within the organization can
handle it.
 Vendors: Provide your company with key materials for projects and may offer support
for the piece they supply.
 Virtual assistants: Work from their own ofﬁces to provide you with the support you
need to get your work done. Great for entrepreneurs and small business owners who
don’t have the space or ﬁnancial resources to employ a full-time assistant. For more
information about virtual assistants, visit www.assistu.com.
You may talk with your prospective manager during your interview. By knowing the manage-
ment style that allows you to be most productive, you can ask direct, carefully worded
questions to discern whether each prospective manager is someone you can work with 
productively.
If you’re your own boss or planning to be, Worksheet 6-12 requires you to create a split 
personality for a moment. Answer the questions as accurately as you can as an employee,
thinking all the while about how you can better manage yourself.
Use Worksheet 6-12 to record what your manager can do to make you more productive and
fulﬁlled. Begin by putting a check mark next to all of the qualities and traits that your perfect
manager would have and then go back and circle the six that are most important to you.

After you read your proﬁle, you may feel a bit discouraged or doubtful. You may worry that
such a place doesn’t exist and that you’re wasting your time to even think about it. Don’t let
yourself drop into this downward spiral for too long. Instead keep your focus on what works

Determining Your Innate Areas of Intelligence
Each person possesses natural talents or intelligence in one or more areas. The trick is to
ﬁgure out in what ways you’re naturally gifted and to let your talents guide you to your
future career.
During your school years, you most likely thought that good verbal and mathematical skills
indicated intelligence, while other talents did not. Thanks to research by Howard Gardner,
author of Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, published by Basic Books, we
now know that intelligence encompasses a variety of talents from traditional signs of intelli-
gence to more creative demonstrations of intelligence such as interpersonal skills, musical
skills, athletic skills, and artistic skills. In addition, the fact that someone has limited abili-
ties in one area doesn’t mean that a person has limited abilities in other areas. In fact, most
people tend to excel in two or three areas of the intelligence.

To discover where your talents fall, complete Worksheet 7-1, which is based on seven of the
most common intelligences. As you read each section, place a check mark next to any skills
you know you have or enjoy. The items in the worksheet are grouped so that similar skills
are close together. If you ﬁnd that a skill you have isn’t listed, add it to the list in the extra
spaces provided.
Before you get started, take a look at a real-life example. Linda, a meeting planner from
Florida, has some skills using words, but she doesn’t consider this area to be one of her
best strengths. See Figure 7-1 for the ﬁrst section of Linda’s Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle, the
place to start when determining your own multiple intelligences.
As Linda completed this section of the checklist, she found skills she uses in her current
work (using proper grammar, editing, impromptu speaking, and using basic writing skills,
which she wrote in) and some skills she uses in her volunteer work at the library (dramatic
reading and storytelling). She also realized that within her stories she always includes vivid
descriptions of characters and locations. Before she read this list, she hadn’t realized she
had that skill.
As you complete Worksheet 7-1, you may ﬁnd that you check more items or fewer items
than Linda did. Your goal is not to check a speciﬁc number of items, but to know that each
item you select is a skill you have or enjoy in your work or your personal activities. You’ll
naturally have more skills in some areas than others.

While your Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle is fresh in your mind, use the following three steps
to reﬁne your list of skills even more:
1. Begin by eliminating skills you are good at but don’t enjoy.
Although you may be tempted to think that you should do whatever you’re good 
at, doing something you don’t enjoy is a drain whether you excel at the skill or not. 
Do yourself a favor and cross out any skills in Worksheet 7-1, whether they are 
checked or not, that you don’t enjoy. For example, if you are a skilled editor but 
now ﬁnd the process extremely tedious and no longer enjoyable, cross the skill off 
your list.

Chapter 7: Uncovering Skills That Make Time Fly

The skills you’d rather not pursue in the long run may, in the short run, help you move
into a new ﬁeld or industry. For example, you know you want to move out of bookkeep-
ing and accounting, but your ability to work the numbers may be just what you need 
to get your foot in the door of a new ﬁeld or provide you with a reliable income while
you start your own company. Don’t toss your long held skills away; put them on the
back burner for now until you begin plotting how to transition into your new ﬁeld or
position.
2. Remove the skills you want to use only in your personal life.
In certain cases, you may have a skill you thoroughly enjoy but know you want to use
only in your hobby or volunteer work. For instance, you may love to cook or build
steam engines, but you know that you don’t want to incorporate these skills into your
work. If you have no interest in or intention of using a talent professionally (you enjoy
cooking but not enough to slave over a hot stove for eight or more hours a day!), cross
the skill off your list in Worksheet 7-1.
Don’t talk yourself into crossing out something you really would love to incorporate
into your work. Although you may not know how or where it will ﬁt in, keep it on your
list so it can become part of the brainstorming you do in Chapter 9.
3. After you have ﬁne-tuned your list in Worksheet 7-1, count the number of items in
each section and record the totals in the middle column of Worksheet 7-2.
Where do you have the highest concentration of check marks? Recognizing your top two or
three areas of multiple intelligence gives you a broad sense of the kinds of careers that are
likely to match your skills. Later, when you review the careers listed in Chapters 11 through
13, focus your attention on the careers that mirror your areas of multiple intelligence.
Expanding Your List of Favorite Skills
Sometimes looking at how you live your life and do your work can illuminate skills you may

Part II: Finding Your Passions 

A skill you may overlook is one that is as natural for you as breathing. In fact, it’s such a
part of you that you assume all people can and do use it in their work.
If you’re a whiz at editing, speaking, playing an instrument, facilitating groups, or working
with animals and you have a tendency to discount your natural abilities, take a closer look.
You may ﬁnd a clue to your future in a skill that you always assumed everyone brought to
the party. (Doesn’t the fact that you’re the only person willing to give the toast at weddings
let you know that most people don’t enjoy public speaking?)
Begin by thinking about the situations listed in Worksheet 7-3. As you read each description,
focus on the skills and actions that come easily to you. In many respects, these talents are
second nature to you and are such a part of who you are that you may need to do some
detective work to tease them out.
In doing this worksheet, Sam, a community liaison ofﬁcer from Texas, discovered two skills
he’d never given himself credit for. He realized that his ability for impromptu speaking
meant he was often the person who put others at ease in uncomfortable social settings 
and work-related events. Because this is something he does naturally, he never considered
this to be a special skill until he did this activity. In addition, he discovered that this same
skill helps him defuse difﬁcult exchanges between co-workers, clients, volunteers, and even
friends. On many occasions, Sam has been the one to turn a potentially explosive situation
into a workable opportunity for clear communication. Sam was somewhat aware of this
skill, but until he took the time to do this activity, he hadn’t seen how pervasive this partic-
ular skill has been in his life at work and at home.
As you complete this section, take a moment to circle any new skills that surface. Do these
skills follow the pattern of your Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle or do they bring another ele-
ment of your skills to light?
If you have difﬁculty deciding how this exercise applies to you, ask a few trusted friends 
and family members for skills that they see as a natural part of you that you often take for
granted. Write down any additional skills you come up with in the space provided.
The ways in which you help others can also give you additional clues to your passions and
talents.
When individuals from each of the groups listed in Worksheet 7-4 call upon you for help,
which of your skills and talents do you use? Another way to think about this question is,
what do you enjoy doing for others?
If you notice any new skills in this worksheet, circle them so they’re easy to see later. 
Once again, compare these skills to your overall Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle to discover
whether they conﬁrm the pattern you’ve already seen or add to your knowledge about 
your skills.
If you just ﬁnd more conﬁrmation of a multiple intelligence you’ve seen before, don’t
despair. Seeing similarities in your answers is a wonderful sign that you are on track and
beginning to see a strong pattern. If you ﬁnd a new skill, rejoice in your discovery. At this
point, don’t spend time worrying about how to make sense of your diverse skills. It’s far 
too early in the process to be making ﬁrm decisions about your next career.

Considering the Processes You Enjoy Most
Another source for understanding your talents is to look at the processes you enjoy in your
work. A process is a sequence of tasks that remains the same even when the speciﬁc nature
of the project changes. For example:
 Whether you build a tree house or a house, the process of building is similar.
 Whether you write an article or a book, the basic process of writing is similar.
 Whether you’re organizing a drawer of ofﬁce supplies or a garage, the process of 
organizing is similar.

Chapter 7: Uncovering Skills That Make Time Fly

Take a look at the following list of processes:
 Creating
 Planning an event
 Designing
 Researching
 Inventing
 Producing
 Forecasting
 Starting up a project
 Managing a project
 Turning something around
 Composing
 Cooking
Do you see what they all have in common? Each and every process ends in “–ing” which
means they refer to an action. If you’re familiar with what it takes to fulﬁll one of these
actions, you know that several often complex tasks and skills are required to achieve
results. If one of these processes is calling your name, you probably enjoy the entire
sequence of tasks and want to be in the middle of this action whenever possible.
To uncover your key processes, use this ﬁve-step process:
1. List projects you have enjoyed throughout your life.
2. Identify the projects that currently excite you.
3. Categorize similar projects into project groups.
4. Discover the best theme for each project group.
5. Select the processes you enjoy most.
As you work through this process, pay attention to the real-life example woven into the
activity.
1. List projects you have enjoyed throughout your life.
Mike, a salesperson for construction supplies from Colorado, began this activity by
taking a tour of his home and taking a walk down memory lane to remember proj-
ects he enjoyed over the years. Take a look at part of his initial list of projects in 
Figure 7-2.
To prepare yourself for this process, take time to walk around your home for visual
cues of your favorite projects. Here are some ideas to get you started:
• Peer into your closets, attic, and basement for signs of your hobbies.
• Take a tour of your garage to uncover projects you enjoyed in the past.
• Look for half-ﬁnished projects you wish you had time to complete.
Your memories may hold clues as well:
• Think about past and present work projects to identify the parts you enjoy most.
• Review your volunteer projects.
• Reminisce about projects you enjoyed as a child.
In Worksheet 7-5, start listing the projects you’ve enjoyed at some point in your life.
They can be work related, school related, or part of your personal life. What matters
is that, when you participated in these projects, you felt excited, fed, and magnetized
by the process.

2. Identify the projects that currently excite you.
Return to Worksheet 7-5 and use an asterisk to mark the projects that continue to
intrigue and excite you to this day.
Take a look at the projects that still hold Mike’s attention by looking at the asterisks in
Figure 7-2.

3. Categorize similar projects into project groups.
Review Figure 7-3 to see what project groups Mike created. Note that Mike included
one project in two different project groups. What he noticed is that “Taking landscape
photographs” tapped into two different ideas: being in nature and photographing.
Now, sort your projects into project groups. As you look at your projects, do you see
any projects that are similar? Remember that there are no right answers here. Your
projects may in fact fall into several groups, as Mike’s did. Your job is to record each
grouping you discover in Worksheet 7-6.
If you have a hard time spotting the themes, write each of your projects on a separate
slip of paper. Then move the slips of paper around until you see similarities. You may
also ﬁnd it helpful to do this task with someone who is not as close to the projects as
you are.

4. Discover the best theme for each project group.
Think of a theme as a common thread or process that ties the projects together. You
may even ﬁnd that your group of projects illustrates more than one theme.
Refer back to Mike’s themes in Figure 7-3. Notice that Mike thought two themes were
relevant in his ﬁrst project group: writing and researching.
Notice also how all of Mike’s themes end in “–ing.” Search for a word or phrase with an
embedded “–ing” and you’re on the right track.
5. Select the processes you enjoy most.
Review all your themes to discover the processes you want to incorporate into your
next career. Circle the ones you like most.
As you think about your favorite processes, notice what they add to your knowledge of

After you feel comfortable with your list, record your Top 20 Favorite Skills in Worksheet 7-7.
After you complete your Top 20 Favorite Skills list, read it over to conﬁrm that everything on
the list feels like you. This list must not only be complete but also be a good representation
of who you are because it becomes one of the main building blocks for the brainstorming
activity in Chapter 9.
If you ﬁnd yourself resisting an item, consider leaving it off the list. If you included an item
that you think “should” be on this list because it’s the family business (embalming has
never been your cup of tea) or because you have a great deal of education in the area,
please reconsider. If you don’t enjoy the skill or if including the skill pressures you to be
something you aren’t, this skill is more likely to sabotage your happiness than help you
achieve it. Do yourself a favor and delete that skill before you start creating your future.

Discovering Topics That Make 
You Sizzle with Excitement
In This Chapter
 Recognizing topics that intrigue you
 Nailing down tools and equipment you like to use
 Figuring out which industries appeal to you
 Narrowing down your list of interests
Your expertise and interest in a certain area bring with it a particular language, focus,
and sense of humor that deﬁne your work.
Because you may be looking to take an entirely new professional direction, the questions
and worksheets in this chapter help you explore a wide range of interests in your profes-
sional life and your personal life. I include a variety of questions in Worksheets 8-1 through
8-4 because I want to trigger your imagination from as many angles as possible to help you
create a thorough list of your interests in Worksheet 8-5.
In Chapter 9 you combine the interests you discover in this chapter with the skills and 
talents you identify in Chapter 7 to brainstorm new career ideas.
Don’t be concerned if a particular worksheet doesn’t produce any ideas for you. Think
about the question a bit and then move on.
Finding the Topics That Always 
Draw Your Attention
When you read the paper, listen to the news, visit a bookstore, or talk with people, what
topics grab your attention? These topics provide valuable clues about your passions, which
may ultimately point you in the direction of a particular career. Don’t be concerned with
how it’s going to happen. Just know that identifying your interests opens the door to career
ideas that fascinate and delight you.
In Worksheet 8-1, I include a list of topics to get you started, but please don’t limit yourself
to just this list. Place a check mark next to any and all topics that intrigue, interest, or fasci-
nate you. If additional topics or subtopics come to mind as you read the list, catch them!
Don’t let them escape or fade away — write them down in the extra space provided at the
end of the list.

If you don’t feel inspired or interested in much of anything these days, the “muscle” that
helps you know you’re interested in a conversation, drawn to a ﬂavor of ice cream, or pulled
to read a book may have atrophied. Using it again reawakens that internal quickening that
happens when you enjoy something. Expand your horizons by experimenting — for exam-
ple, take a class, go to a museum, visit the library, or do things you used to love. Keep your
senses open for signs that you’re enjoying yourself. Chapter 2 includes some additional
strategies for you as well.

Listing Tools, Equipment, and Raw Materials
That Make Your Work Play
If you love the tactile experience of working with your hands, tools, equipment, and raw
materials may deﬁne the work you love.
The number of tools, equipment, and raw materials is inﬁnite, so use the following lists as a
starting point. Then personalize your list by looking around your home and ofﬁce for other
tangible things you enjoy using in your hobbies, projects around the house, your volunteer
work, and at work.
Place a check mark in front of any tools, equipment, or raw materials listed in Worksheet 8-3
that you would like to use in your next career. (If tangible things don’t ﬂoat your boat, don’t
worry about it. Just do the best you can and move on.) After you create your list, if you ﬁnd
that you have more than ten items listed, circle the ten you most want to use in your next
career.
You don’t have to know how these tools and materials will combine with your skills to
create your next career. For now just focus your attention on whether you’d like to use
these tools and materials in your work if given an opportunity.

Understanding the attributes of an industry helps you get a feel for whether that industry
and its occupations are a good ﬁt for you. After you narrow your focus to a particular indus-
try, turn to Chapter 14 for more information on how to research an industry.
Recording Your Favorite Interests
Take a moment to review all of the interests you identiﬁed in the following worksheets:
 Worksheet 8-1: Your Favorite Topics of Interest
 Worksheet 8-2: Uncovering More Topics of Interest
 Worksheet 8-3: Your Favorite Tools, Equipment, and Raw Materials
 Worksheet 8-4: Intriguing Industries
Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to identify your top 20 interests that you’d most like
to include in your work. As you record your favorite interests in Worksheet 8-5, you create a
valuable list of clues that consists of topics, equipment, and industries.
In Chapter 9 you combine this list (Items 21–40) with your favorite skills from Chapter 7
(Items 1–20) to stimulate your creativity as you brainstorm a variety of possible career
ideas.
Please note that if you don’t choose an item, you aren’t abandoning that interest com-
pletely. In fact, if you have an interest that you know is more of a hobby than a focus for
your next career, don’t include it in this list.
The key is that every entry in Worksheet 8-5 reﬂects the interests you’d like to incorporate
into your work. Keep in mind that you don’t, in this moment, need to know how the topic
ﬁts into your career picture. (Chapter 9 shows you how to combine your favorite interests
with your list of favorite skills from Chapter 7 to create a list of concrete career ideas.)
As you complete this worksheet, take the opportunity to ﬁne-tune your list by removing any
duplicate topics, adding any interests that are missing from your list, eliminating anything
you’ve listed only because your mother always thought you enjoyed it, and modifying the
wording to make each item as accurate and informative as possible.
When considering a career change, you need to focus on your present wishes, rather than
on what you’ve done in the past or what you think you should do. To help you break free of
restrictive thoughts, consider the following possibility:
If you knew you’d be well taken care of ﬁnancially no matter what career you chose, how
would you answer the following questions?
 Would you rethink any of the interests you listed in Worksheet 8-5?
 Would you drop a topic you dislike even though it’s practical?
 Would you delete an entry you’re tired of even though you spent years attaining that
expertise?
 Would you add an artistic and aesthetic passion to your list in Worksheet 8-5?
Make whatever changes necessary to make Worksheet 8-5 as true to your interests as 
possible.

Brainstorming Intriguing 
Career Ideas
In This Chapter
 Reviewing your top skills and interests
 Jotting down career ideas you already have
 Brainstorming possible dream careers
 Developing an expanded list of possible jobs
 Selecting your top ten career ideas
A
s you think about your next career, you may use what you’ve done in the past as your
guide to your next position. Although this linear approach may yield results, it may
also limit you if you’re at all frustrated with your current career. Focusing on only your recent
past, rather than on your true career passions, can severely limit your opportunities.
The fun, nonlinear creativity worksheets in this chapter help you use a broader range of
passions and interests as the basis for brainstorming potential career ideas. You’ll get the
most out of this chapter if you do the brainstorming activities after you’ve completed the
worksheets in Chapters 7 and 8, which help you create lists of your favorite skills and inter-
ests, or if you use other sources to create those lists.
Use this chapter to expand your career horizons. Have fun playing with the worksheets in
this chapter; the more you work with them, the more you get out of this chapter. Dream big.
Be outrageous. Give all of the ideas you come up with equal weight in your brainstorming
process. You have plenty of opportunities to evaluate and enhance the feasibility of your
ideas in Chapter 10.
Preparing the Way for New Ideas
Before you begin brainstorming, you may want to take a good look at your favorite skills in
Worksheet 7-7 and your favorite interests in Worksheet 8-5 (ideally, you’ve already ﬁlled out
those worksheets). Verify that you thoroughly enjoy every element on both of your lists. If
you feel any sense of hesitation, dislike, or dread associated with an item — no matter what
the reason — let that item go. You need to make your list as strong as you possibly can by
deleting or modifying elements that don’t quite work for you.
If you cross out an item on either list or you didn’t ﬁll out the worksheets completely the
ﬁrst time around, take another look. Do you see anything from the other worksheets in
Chapters 7 or 8 that you’d like to add to ﬁll in the empty spaces in these worksheets? If so,

now is the time. If you ﬁnd more than 20 skills or topics you absolutely love, don’t hold back.
Just add them to the end of the appropriate list.
If you list more than 20 skills or topics, you need to do one more step before you start brain-
storming. For the brainstorming activity to work properly, every item on your lists must have
a unique number. The skills on Worksheet 7-7 are numbered 1 through 20. The interests on
Worksheet 8-5 are numbered 21 through 40. Begin numbering your additions at 41 and keep
going until each item you’ve added has its own number. To retain the richness and depth of
your list, do not group or combine your items.
Recording Career Ideas Already on Your Mind
Before you begin brainstorming, record on paper any careers you may already be thinking
about. By jotting your ideas down in Worksheet 9-1, you don’t have to work so hard to keep
them in mind while you’re brainstorming. When you’re ready to assess which ideas are your
favorites in Worksheet 9-7, remember to include this list in your evaluation.
If, at this point, you don’t have any idea what your next career might be, don’t sweat it. Just
move on to the next section.
Dreaming Up New Career Ideas
Imagine that you have a deck of cards and each card in the deck represents one of the skills
or interests included in Worksheets 7-7 and 8-5. Imagine further that you can deal out the
cards from this deck in various combinations that represent different dream careers. As you
shufﬂe this deck in your mind, consider how many exciting combinations exist. The possi-
bilities are endless.
Although you may get some career ideas by scanning your lists, playing with various combi-
nations allows you to see speciﬁc ideas more easily. First read over this three-step approach.
Then take a look at the example in Figure 9-1. Use the steps and example to brainstorm your
own intriguing career ideas in Worksheet 9-2.
1. Choose four numbers at random between 1 and 40.
Write the numbers you choose on the blanks provided in the ﬁrst row of Worksheet 9-2.
Avoid reusing these numbers in a future worksheet.
If you added items to either worksheet, replace the number 40 with the largest number
you came up with when you numbered the new items on your worksheets.

Worksheet 9-2.
3. Brainstorm as many career ideas as you can that include at least three of the four
elements in your list. You might come up with a job title, a project, a job task, or a
business idea.
Stretch your mind. Think creatively. An idea may come to you in a ﬂash, or you might
try telling yourself a story, weaving in as many of the words as you can. Look at each
word from various angles to see what other directions your brainstorming can take. 
At this stage, any idea is a good idea! Don’t censure your ﬂow of creativity. Do what you
can to ﬁll in the ten career blanks provided in Worksheet 9-2. Chapter 10 can help you
reﬁne your ideas and narrow your focus.
Jill, a frustrated administrative assistant with artistic talents from Seattle, chose numbers
12, 14, 32, and 6. After writing down the numbers, she referred back to her worksheets and
learned they corresponded with the phrases listed under each number in Figure 9-1. In her
next step, she brainstormed some career ideas that incorporated the elements from her
original lists of favorite skills and interests. Notice that some of her ideas are job titles while
others are projects or job tasks. At this stage of the game, her main goal is to get her ideas
down on paper — the exact form isn’t all that important.
On your ﬁrst pass through each worksheet, plan to spend about ten minutes coming up
with possible career ideas; you can always come back later to round out your lists of career
ideas for each “hand.” Don’t fret if you don’t reach ten careers; the worksheets are helpful
even when you don’t ﬁll in all the blanks.

Chapter 9: Brainstorming Intriguing Career Ideas

If, after you work for a while with the hand you dealt yourself, you realize that one word
really doesn’t ﬁt with the others, choose another number at random and replace the
unworkable item with the new phrase.
Repeat the three steps listed earlier in this section as you work on Worksheets 9-3, 9-4, 
and 9-5.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to want to do the job to include it on your brainstorming
list. If a job comes to mind, put it on your list no matter how outlandish, kooky, or bizarre it
seems at ﬁrst glance. That very idea you consider leaving off the list may be the very one
that steers you in an exciting new direction.
Don’t worry about how much you know or don’t know about what’s out there. With what
you know right now, you can create the career ideas you need. In fact, you may surprise
yourself with the ideas you come up with! After you’ve had a chance to brainstorm, Chap-
ters 11 through 13 can help you expand your horizons even further.
Sometimes brainstorming for yourself is hard. You may get caught up in “this-is-never-
going-to-work” thinking. You may have convinced yourself that you aren’t any good at 
brainstorming. You may be so attached to how it’s all going to work out that you aren’t able
to stay in the moment to play around with your ideas. Don’t despair. Enlist the help of a
friend or two. Tell them that you are working on a project and need some help brainstorm-
ing. Just show them the four words or phrases you’re working with and ask them whether
they know of any careers that incorporate three or four of the ideas. Let them know that 
any ideas they come up with are worth writing down — even if they don’t think you’d like 
to do the job.

Chapter 9: Brainstorming Intriguing Career Ideas

Expanding Your Career Horizons
After people brainstorm possible career ideas, they often wonder whether they’re missing
something. They question whether they know enough about what’s out there to have made
an adequate attempt at coming up with a list of career ideas.
The number of jobs that exist today is inﬁnite and constantly growing. There is no way you
can know or research all the options that exist. Instead of being overwhelmed with all the
possibilities, shift your strategy to narrowing your options to high-potential career areas so
that when you begin your research, your explorations can be focused, thorough, and deep
in the ﬁelds that count.
Sometimes looking at a variety of careers can trigger your thinking. To help you explore
what is out there, Chapters 11 through 13 describe career ideas that correspond to the 
multiple intelligence charts in Chapter 7. Take a quick look at Worksheet 7-2 to recall the
two or three multiple intelligence categories that ranked highest for you. Focus your atten-
tion on the chapters that are most relevant to you. If you haven’t ﬁlled out Worksheet 7-2,
read the introductions to Chapters 11 through 13 to determine which group of careers inter-
ests you most.
 Chapter 11: Communicating careers
• Thinking in words
• Connecting well with others
 Chapter 12: Scientiﬁc/logical careers
• Thinking in a logical, organized fashion
• Appreciating nature and its creatures

• Having a good sense of your body
• Having an ear for music
As you read through the chapters, make note of any careers that intrigue you. You don’t
have to know how you’d move into these careers at this point. The most important thing is
that the description of the career area grabs your attention and makes you want to know
more. As you ﬁnd interesting careers, use Worksheet 9-6 to record the chapter, page number,
and heading of each ﬁnd. While you’re there, note any job titles you’d like to investigate 
further.

Chapter 9: Brainstorming Intriguing Career Ideas

George, a talented writer in his personal time, was intrigued by several job titles included in
the technical writing section in Chapter 11 on page 123. Follow this same pattern as you add
careers that interest you.
Don’t feel that you must look under every heading to search out career ideas or that you
must have the solution to your career dilemma before you can move on to Chapter 10. If an
idea is missing from the list you create in this chapter, the process in the next few chapters
can help you ﬁll in any gaps. Remember that you’re in the middle of the brainstorming
process at this point — not the end of it.
Recording Your Top Ten Intriguing Careers
To take your discovery process to the next level, review all the career ideas you’ve come up
with in this chapter.
 Worksheet 9-1: Ideas you had already thought of
 Worksheets 9-2 through 9-5: Ideas you brainstormed by using your favorite skills and
interests
 Worksheet 9-6: Ideas you found while exploring the careers listed in Chapters 11
through 13
Circle any careers or business ideas that appeal to you. Shoot for a total of ten ideas. Then
copy them into Worksheet 9-7. You don’t have to be sold on the feasibility or practicality of
your career ideas to include them in this list. You just need to feel interested in, drawn to, or
intrigued by the idea or some aspect of it.

Part II: Finding Your Passions 

You may end up doing one of the careers that you list in Worksheet 9-7. And then again, you
may not! You may ultimately choose a career that combines several of your ideas. As you
explore your intriguing career ideas, you may also be drawn in an entirely different direc-
tion. For now, don’t stress yourself out by trying to ﬁgure out which direction is right. Instead,
relax.
If you want to proceed directly to Chapter 10, that’s where you begin taking a deeper 
look at your top ten career ideas, reﬁning your focus, and identifying the themes that best 
describe your career interests. By the end of that chapter, you take your top ten careers 
and narrow your focus to your top two career ideas.

 Narrowing your focus to two careers
I
f you’ve been thinking about your career options, either by working through the previous
chapters of this book or on your own, you may be a bit overwhelmed with all of your
options. You aren’t sure which ideas are likely to work; you aren’t sure how to identify
your best ideas. The activities in this chapter help you narrow your top ten career ideas
(from Chapter 9) to the two career ideas you want to investigate in more detail.
This process works best if you’ve worked through Chapters 7 and 8 to create your lists of
favorite skills and interests and then used those lists in Chapter 9 to brainstorm your favorite
career ideas. Even if you haven’t done those chapters, you can still beneﬁt from this chapter
by sitting down now and making a list of the ten careers you’re considering.
Instead of looking at your Top Ten list and trying to ﬁgure out which one is going to be 
“it,” look at each career idea on the list as a clue to what you ﬁnd interesting and appeal-
ing. Instead of sitting right there in broad daylight, your next career may be waiting in the
shadows — a combination or a modiﬁcation of what’s on your list that you’ll have to do a
little searching to discover.
Making the Most of This Chapter
The process of converting your Top Ten list into your Top Two list is more like a logic
puzzle with multiple solutions than a simple equation with only one answer.
You begin this chapter by considering a wide range of possibilities. As you settle on each
piece of information and conﬁrm, “yes, that’s something I want,” another part of the logic
puzzle comes into focus. Until the entire solution is clear, ﬁnding a new clue may require
you to take a step back to reconﬁgure how everything ﬁts together as a whole.

To clarify your thinking and ﬁne-tune your career puzzle, you swing back and forth between
the speciﬁc aspects of your career list and the topics and skills your career ideas are built
on and the overarching themes and goals that begin to come into focus. Whether you’re
looking at broad themes or speciﬁc details, always keep your eye on the prize: your ideal
career.
Finding the solution to your career puzzle is likely to move forward in ﬁts and starts. You
may move along smoothly for a while and then notice a potential conﬂict between two
aspects of your puzzle. Perhaps you revel in the idea of working from home but know that
you’ll go a bit stir-crazy if you don’t have contact with other people each day, or you dis-
cover that working with your favorite population means your busiest times are when you
had hoped to be off the clock. When this happens, back away for a time to see the broader
picture again. Look for creative ways to get the two pieces to ﬁt together. You may need to
try several conﬁgurations before you ﬁnd the ones that are most promising.
As you explore your ideas, you may see that you’re attracted to careers with common job
titles, such as accountant, marketing communications specialist, software engineer, sales-
person. Or you may be attracted to careers that aren’t so easy to label, such as the job of
traveling around the world scouting for places to shoot movie scenes (is that all this person
does?). Although you may feel pressure to ﬁnd a job title for your new career right away,
don’t push too hard to ﬁnd one. The absence of a name doesn’t mean the opportunity 
doesn’t exist; it may just be that your career idea is on the cutting edge.
Exploring Your Career Ideas in Depth
The ﬁrst step in narrowing your focus to your top two career ideas is to record your cur-
rent thoughts about each of your top ten career ideas. To prepare for the worksheet in 
this section, copy your top ten career ideas from Worksheet 9-7 into the ﬁrst column of
Worksheet 10-1.
As soon as your list of careers is in place, begin your exploration by taking a closer look 
at the pros and cons of each career on your list. The more clues you uncover about what
intrigues you and what concerns you about each career idea, the more your future direction
comes into focus.
In the top section for each career listed in Worksheet 10-1, write down several phrases to
describe what excites you about each career idea on your list. It may be one or more of the
following:
 A feeling: It can be a feeling of freedom, independence, or responsibility.
 The work format: This can include working alone, part-time possibilities, or travel.
 The work itself: You can include tasks, topics, or roles.
 The lifestyle: You may want to include things like the vacation schedule, the ability to
get home early, or more time with friends and family.
Each career or business idea you list in Worksheet 10-1 has both an upside and a downside.
Based on what you know right now, what worries you about each of your career ideas? Jot
down the phrases that come to mind in the appropriate section associated with each career
listed in Worksheet 10-1. Again, think about the work tasks involved in this career and how
this career might impact your ideal work arrangements and your lifestyle.

If you ﬁnd the same issues surfacing again and again, don’t despair — celebrate, instead!
Repetitive clues are a gift because they illustrate what is truly important to you. Note any
repetitive clues you discover by recording them in Worksheet 10-2.
Don’t be overly concerned about the worries you record for each career on your list. By list-
ing the concerns that are circling in your mind, you discover more about what’s important
to you. In some cases, your worries help guide you to a new work arrangement or a new
angle on a profession. In other cases, your concerns become a catalyst for some deeper
thinking about trade-offs and your priorities. Any way you look at it, your worries are a rich
source of clues about you and your needs. Rather than brush them under the rug, bring
them out in the open for a frank look at your options. Keep in mind that some of your wor-
ries are likely to evaporate as you ﬁnd out more about each career in Chapters 14 and 15.
Searching for Themes
By looking at your list of top ten careers from a different perspective, you gain access to
another valuable window into understanding what intrigues you. Discovering the overlying
themes associated with your list gives you crucial information that simultaneously narrows
your focus and expands your options.
Because the process of working your list of top ten careers down to your top two career
options unfolds differently for each person based on the content of his or her Top Ten list,
I include two examples to demonstrate this process. You ﬁnd references to both of these
examples throughout this section.

After you read through the following steps to help you complete Worksheet 10-3, be sure to
study the two examples before searching for your own themes.
Step 1: Copy your list of top ten careers (from the ﬁrst column of Worksheet 10-1) into
the ﬁrst column of Worksheet 10-3. This is the last time I’ll ask you to do this, I promise! If
you’d like to add a new spin to this task, begin to group similar careers together as you go.
This step isn’t required. In the examples, Belinda sorted her list as she wrote them down,
while Joanne copied them directly from her Worksheet 10-1.
Step 2: Identify the themes that are represented in your list. Jot your themes in the second
column of Worksheet 10-3. A number of different kinds of themes may surface during this
process. Don’t worry about what category your themes fall into; just list as many themes
as you see. In the examples you ﬁnd the following:

Chapter 10: Sifting Out Your Most Intriguing Dream Careers
Use the categories I provide as starting points for your own theme exploration. If other
theme categories emerge from your list, go with them. You might ﬁnd themes that appear
around your target client or whether the work is indoors or outdoors. Don’t try to force-ﬁt
your list into the categories described in this example because that approach won’t work.
You must run with what your list is showing you.
If you have trouble seeing how to categorize your ideas, write each idea on a separate slip
of paper and move the papers around until you see similarities. You can probably sort the
careers in your list in several different ways — by skills you use, by work arrangement, by
ultimate customer — so don’t be concerned about doing it right. As you ﬁnd themes that
make sense, write them down in Worksheet 10-3 so you can study them later.
Step 3: Sort your careers according to the themes that make the most sense to you.
Grouping your career ideas helps you begin to see the patterns that are emerging. As you
see in the examples, all your ideas may fall under one broad category (Belinda), or they
may cluster around two or three distinct themes (Joanne).
 Belinda: For the most part, all the entries on Belinda’s list fall under one broad cat-
egory of helping others improve their lives. Within that category, Belinda identiﬁed
several useful clues to help her restructure her ideas.
 Joanne: Joanne organized her career ideas into three categories. Take a look at how
she structured her conclusions.
Sometimes you’ll ﬁnd careers that don’t really ﬁt the overall themes. That’s ﬁne. For instance,
Belinda’s list had one outlier (organization coach), while Joanne’s list had several (forest/
park ranger, working for a sports/running magazine, and being a teacher).
Step 4: Create an umbrella statement that describes your overriding mission or goal. This
step is easiest if all of your career ideas fall under one broad category or if your categories
are related. If you have a wide variety of themes, make an attempt at creating an umbrella
statement, but don’t force it.
 Belinda’s umbrella statement is “Supporting people in discovering different ways to do
what they do with the ultimate goal of improving, simplifying, and transforming their
lives.”
 Although Joanne didn’t state hers, she might have said her umbrella statement was
“Improving people’s relationship with their bodies and minds.” Notice that she came
to clear conclusions without stating her overall goal.
Step 5: Notice the careers that are ﬂoating to the top.
 Belinda: With her new level of clarity gained from Worksheet 10-3, Belinda can continue
playing with her ideas to deﬁne how she’d like to fulﬁll her purpose while working with
her favorite topics in these formats/settings. The fact that she didn’t have a clear-cut
career at the end of this process didn’t bother Belinda. In fact, because she’d never seen
her passions described in this way before, she was excited to explore possible positions
and business ideas.
 Joanne: From Worksheet 10-3, Joanne easily identiﬁed three areas she wanted to learn
more about: counseling, physical therapy, and teaching.
As you move through Steps 1 through 5, you may need to ﬂip back and forth between the
steps, the examples, and your Worksheet 10-3. Take it one step at a time. Sit with your own
list to discover the clues it has for you about your next career. There’s no hurry. Take the

time you need to feel comfortable with your themes, the way you categorize your careers,
and your umbrella statement.
In case you’re wondering, here’s what Belinda and Joanne decided:
 Belinda is in the process of creating a composite career — working full time as an 
organizational consultant and creating a part-time business on the side to work with
individuals as a career change/transition coach. (For an explanation of composite
careers, see the section “Contemplating Various Career Forms,” later in this chapter.)
 Joanne is in school working toward a degree in occupational therapy, a career that’s
similar to physical therapy.
Isolating Your Key Career Criteria
At this point, you’re quite familiar with your top ten career ideas. Something about each one
intrigues you. What you don’t know is how you’ll ever narrow down your options. The work-
sheet in this section helps you identify the criteria that are most important to you as you
make decisions about your next career.
For some people, one element or characteristic of their career or lifestyle is so important to
them that it is the cornerstone of their new career. For others, several characteristics play a
role in how they prioritize their career choices.
May, a former volunteer coordinator and a newly trained therapist in New Jersey, is embark-
ing on her third career. Although she knows that she wants to use her new skills in her work,
she’s not quite sure what form her work will take because her Top Ten career list includes
everything from working for social services to being a child advocate to having her own
practice. As she reads the key criteria in Worksheet 10-4, she is able to clearly articulate
what is most important to her as she makes decisions about the form her career takes. 
You see, May is a new grandmother. Suddenly her priorities have shifted. Although she still
knows it’s important to her that her work has meaning and makes a difference in the lives 
of those she works with and that she thrives when she does therapy with clients, her key
criteria is her lifestyle. Because her grandchildren live in Indiana, she places high priority
on being able to take time off to visit them for 10 to 14 days, several times a year. With this
new clarity, she suddenly ﬁnds it a lot easier to narrow down her choices to those that give
her the freedom to travel and possibly do her work from out of town if the need arises.
Think about your lifestyle, your style, and what you’ve written about your intriguing career
ideas in Worksheets 10-1 and 10-3. Do you see the key to making a decision about your career?
Are there any features of your career that must be in place for your life to work the way
you’d like it to? Use the questions in Worksheet 10-4 to help you sort this out.
Read through the questions and put one slash through the box if your answer to the ques-
tion is a strong, emphatic “yes.” Then look at all the statements with one slash and think
about what you value most about your life and your career. Choose the two or three state-
ments that best reﬂect what’s most important to you as you make your career decisions 
and make a slash in the opposite direction to create an X.
In May’s case, having a career that allowed her to travel to see her grandchildren was the
ﬁrst brick she needed to keep in mind as she built her new career. If she ignored that fea-
ture, the work format and the eventual career would run counter to her needs.

As you proceed with your discovery process, keep your “keys” in mind. They can help you
stay focused as you put the pieces of your career puzzle in place. In fact, by identifying your
keys, you may be able to identify, with more certainty, the cornerstones of your career puzzle.
After these important pieces are in place, you can begin to build your career around them.
Contemplating Various Career Forms
As you tie your career ideas and your key career decision criteria together, you may be
bumping into elements that don’t seem to work together. Although it’s too soon to ﬁnalize
your next career, it’s not too soon to begin broadening your perspective about how your
career ideas may take form. As you read this section, use the ideas to help you think outside
the box about how you might create a career that truly works for you. Take the ideas in,
work them around in your mind, but don’t feel you need to identify the ﬁnal form of your
career just yet. Instead, use the ideas to spark new creative options you may not have
known about before now.
As you begin to search for your next career, you can easily fall into the trap of thinking, and
hoping, that your career is going to have a simple title and a singular focus: pilot, nurse,
doctor, secretary, lawyer. You get the idea. The truth is that many careers are as diverse and
multifaceted as people are. Although these careers aren’t easy to cubbyhole, they are rich,
interesting, and amazing in their diversity. In fact, opportunities abound!
If you have several ideas you really like, you might consider combining your favorite themes
to create a unique career. The following examples show how people have found success in
their careers by combining a variety of talents into a single career:
Keys to Your Career Decisions
Is there a particular passion or interest you want to pursue in your work?
Are you enthralled by a particular industry?
Is there a certain company you want to work for?
Is there a distinct topic you feel drawn to incorporate into your work?
Do you thrive when you use a particular process?
Is your work environment the most important factor for you?
Are the people you work with a crucial piece of the puzzle?
Is your work format the clincher?
Is an aspect of your personal style/needs/desires the deciding factor?
Must your work have definite meaning?
Is there an aspect of your lifestyle that defines what you need?

Is there a specific task or function thats the ticket

Chapter 10: Sifting Out Your Most Intriguing Dream Careers

 A writer who is also a counselor combines his skills to create a practice that helps
clients break through their creative blocks.
 An artist with a postgraduate degree in forensics and physical anthropology combines
her talents to help a law enforcement agency reconstruct a face for a recently discov-
ered skull.
 A social worker with clowning talents works as a therapeutic clown in a health-care 
setting to bring laughter, play, and empowerment to hospitalized children and their
families.
 A biologist with advanced programming skills has his pick of jobs as companies search
for bioinformatics programmers to analyze the human genome for potential conﬁgura-
tions that can lead to drug discoveries.
Although ﬁnding the exact combination of skills to create a multifaceted career like this may
take some deep thought, begin the process by playing with your ideas. As you look at your
list of themes in Worksheet 10-3, daydream about how you might combine them. Don’t get
pulled down by the logistics or feasibility of your combinations — just explore the possibili-
ties. Have fun with it!
Another option to consider, if you have multiple interests, is a composite career, a term
introduced by William Bridges in his book JobShift: How to Prosper in a Workplace without
Jobs, published by Perseus Books. In a composite career, you weave several careers together
to create a fulﬁlling professional life that meets your personal and ﬁnancial goals. The format
of a composite career can be designed to meet your speciﬁc needs. For example, a compos-
ite career might have any of the following formats:
 A full-time job with occasional part-time projects on the side
 Two part-time jobs
 One part-time job and a business
 Two businesses
In addition to giving you added ﬂexibility and variety in your work, you also gain a surpris-
ing sense of security with this arrangement. With multiple sources of income, you’re no
longer dependent on one paycheck. If one income stream dries up, you aren’t a sitting duck
because you can always rely on the other one(s) to tide you over. Consider how a compos-
ite career could change how you think about structuring your new career.
Choosing Your Top Two Career Ideas
After reading this chapter and working through each section, what career ideas keep rising
to the top of your list? Your favorites may be careers you included in Worksheet 10-1, con-
clusions you made in Worksheet 10-3, a career you came up with by combining several of
your career ideas together, or a career that came into focus when you identiﬁed your key
career criteria (from Worksheet 10-4) or your umbrella statement (from Worksheet 10-3).
Focus on the two careers that seem the most interesting or promising to you at this time.
By identifying these two careers, you aren’t making a commitment to enter these ﬁelds;
you’re just highlighting these two careers as the ones you’re most interested in exploring.
Record your top two career ideas in Worksheet 10-5. Even if you don’t yet have a complete
picture of these careers, make an effort to describe them the best you can.
116
Part II: Finding Your Passions 

Are you frustrated that you’re being asked to choose only two careers from your list? Are
you disappointed that you must turn away from careers that really do interest you? If so,
you may ﬁnd some relief in the section “Contemplating Various Career Forms,” earlier in this
chapter, which shows you how to combine your favorite elements of various careers into
one workable idea. Also, keep in mind that if one of your ﬁrst career choices doesn’t pan out
as you explore it in more detail in Chapters 14 and 15, you’ll return to your Top Ten career
list again to choose another career to investigate.
Although you have a couple of promising career ideas on your list, you are, in actuality, still
in the middle of your creative process. Nothing is yet set in stone. Before you dive in and
activate your job search, use Chapters 14, 15, and 16 to verify that your career ideas are in
fact good matches for you. As soon as you conﬁrm that they’re viable options for you, you
can proceed to launch your job search, your business planning process, or your return to
school in Chapters 18 and 19.

A
fter you have a seed of a career idea, use this part
to help you convert your idea into any number of
creative career options.
Instead of seeing these chapters as complete lists of possi-
ble careers, think of them as springboards that trigger you
to think of your idea in entirely new ways. Use your Multiple
Intelligence Profile in Chapter 7 to determine which of the
chapters in this part align with your interests. As you scan
each career box, find the career areas that appeal to you.
After you identify a few intriguing options, use the related
job titles and professional associations as the first clues in

Chapter 11
Considering Communicating Careers
In This Chapter
 Checking out careers with a focus on the written word
 Finding careers that involve your ability to speak
 Tapping into careers with education potential
 Using your skills to help people heal physically and emotionally
 Exploring ways to help others enjoy life more
 Assisting others in the workplace
 Keeping people safe as your line of work
W
hether you’re in the process of brainstorming possible career ideas in Chapter 9,
investigating your top two career ideas in Chapter 14, or dipping into the book
right here just to take a look, you can use the career descriptions to expand your options.
Although this chapter can’t possibly list every single career, the descriptions that are
included serve as a launching pad for creative thinking and exploration.
All of the career categories described in this chapter involve communicating in some way.
The section “If You Thrive on Words” offers careers that capitalize on your desire and ability
to use written and spoken words in your work. The section “If You Connect Well with Others”
lists careers that tap into your ability to interact well with others.
If you’re unsure whether these two categories are a good ﬁt for you and your skills, refer
back to Worksheet 7-2 in Chapter 7 to see whether your Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle high-
lights these two career categories. Depending on your Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle, you may
also be interested in exploring the logical/scientiﬁc careers in Chapter 12 or the creative
careers in Chapter 13.
Don’t worry if you don’t ﬁnd a description of one of your ideal careers. The best way to
explore any career, whether it’s included in these pages or not, is to use the Internet.
Chapter 14 provides a number of resources to help you explore the careers you want to
learn more about.
Making the Most of This Chapter
Within each career category in this chapter you ﬁnd descriptions of various career areas.
See Figure 11-1 for an explanation of the career descriptions you ﬁnd in this chapter.
If you’re using this chapter to enhance your list of possible careers as you work through
Chapter 9, record all the career categories that catch your attention in Worksheet 9-6.
Although your exploration opens a number of possible avenues of discovery, don’t get dis-
tracted. For now, use these descriptions to build your list of possible careers. After you use
Chapter 10 to narrow your focus to your top two careers, you can return to this chapter to
explore those ideas in more depth.

If you’ve already identiﬁed your top two careers in Chapter 10 and are now working in
Chapter 14, use the career descriptions in this chapter to better understand your two
favorite options. The professional association contact information is your best source for
current information related to your target careers and industries. The list of related jobs
may open a window to an option you hadn’t considered before. After learning what you
can from the career descriptions, return to Chapter 14 to ﬁnd other ways to discover more
about the careers that interest you most.
Scanning the careers in this chapter may help you think of or discover other careers that ﬁt
your Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle and your interests. Keep track of ideas that come to mind
so that you can follow up on your discoveries later. And if an insight about a possible career
comes to you while you read, snag it! Get it in writing in Worksheet 9-6 as soon as possible
because spontaneous Aha! ideas have a way of fading fast if not acted upon in the moment.
If You Thrive on Words
If you think in words and enjoy expressing your thoughts, feelings, and knowledge with
words, check out the careers in this section. Whether you want to write or work with the
words that others have written, you can ﬁnd various ways to inform, entertain, and con-
vince others through the use of words.
Writing
Words are ubiquitous. Aside from words exchanged in personal correspondence, nearly
every word you read each day — from your cereal box to the daily newspaper to the park-
ing ticket so thoughtfully left on your windshield — has been crafted by a paid professional.
Indeed, words are the currency of the information age and the technology age. If you enjoy
writing, one of the careers in this section may intrigue you.

Counseling and supporting individuals
Related jobs
If you enjoy listening to people and helping them resolve
personal, family, relationship, educational, and mental health
situations, consider a counseling career. Regardless of the
setting, you begin by getting a picture of your client’s
situation and what isn’t working. From what they say, how
they say it, and what they don’t say, you discern their needs
and help them gain the perspective, the skills, and possibly
the medication they need to resolve their difficulties.
Confidentiality, trust, and objectivity are essential elements
of your work. Besides establishing a private practice,
consider working in hospitals, home health agencies, social
service agencies, employee assistance programs, and
rehabilitation settings.

As a chiropractor, acupuncturist, or other alternative
medicine practitioner, you combine your extensive
knowledge of the systems that make up the human body,
your compassion, and your ability to listen to find ways to
ease your patients’ pain. Using the diagnostic system and
devices preferred in your specialty, you evaluate your patient

Mathematics
You use mathematical theory and computational techniques to find 
solutions to practical problems in financial and business settings, the 
social sciences, or the hard sciences. Because so much of your work 
uses computers, knowledge of computer programming is essential, 
as are good reasoning skills and the ability to discuss and explain 
your solutions to others who may not have the extensive mathemati-
cal background that you do. Most employees using mathematics in 
their jobs do not have the word “mathematician” in their job titles. 
Look to engineering, computer science, statistics, physics, atmos-
pheric science, and economics for additional careers that use math 
extensively.

Chapter 12: Exploring Scientiﬁc/Logical Careers

Working in engineering and computer science
Careers in engineering allow you to use scientiﬁc ﬁndings to create viable products or ﬁnd
solutions to technical or structural problems. As a result, most of the work that engineers
and computer scientists do is quite practical and focused on solving speciﬁc problems.
Mechanical engineering
Mechanical engineering entails designing, manufacturing, and testing 
mechanical parts; machines that produce power, such as engines 
and turbines; or machines that use power to run, such as refrigeration 
and production equipment. Your ability to look at problems analytically 
and from different vantage points allows you to find new solutions to 
mechanical problems. As you gain experience, you may have greater 
independence, but remember that the overall project may be a team 
event, making good communication skills a must for success. 
Focusing on a specialty builds your expertise and boosts your 
employability.

project with preconstruction planning, which includes surveying, 
assessing needs, determining budgets, and designing. Then you 
coordinate all aspects of the actual construction, handling and 
making decisions about any problems on the spot. After the work 
is finished, you evaluate the project and maintain it. As you work to 
bring the project in on time, your patience may be tested as you 
encounter delays due to bureaucratic stalls, politics, and the weather.

Analyzing financial research
Whether you predict the performance of specific stocks, evaluate 
the impact of economic policies, or screen business plans for 
possible venture capital funding, expect to spend time studying 
financial trends, crunching numbers, and reading annual reports. 
To handle your intense workload and strict deadlines, you must 
prioritize, work well alone or as part of a team, and have an innate 
ability to work with numeric patterns. With the global economy, 
increased competition, and a greater reliance on analyzing financial 
data, people with analytical skills are in a fine position for employment 
in this career.

Investing
To succeed as an investment broker, you must use your mathematical 
aptitude to evaluate stocks based on research with the goal of making 
profits for your company and clients. You need a thorough under-
standing and gut sense of the market, and you must possess a high 
tolerance for risk. Be prepared to take the blame if your client’s 
portfolio takes a significant dive in value as a result of market moves. 
The investment landscape has changed tremendously over the last 
decade and is likely to continue with the advent of electronic trading, 
large discount brokerage operations, and changes to security 
exchanges.

Managing wildlife
You tend to the needs of wildlife, both game animals that are 
harvested for sport or for food and non-game species. Through 
research and careful data collection, you discover and solve 
problems for species in your area while striving to maintain the 
habitat that the species needs to survive. For the long-term survival 
of wildlife, you spend a considerable amount of time educating the 
public about animals and their needs. Translating scientific details 
into entertaining, everyday language that the public can understand 
is a key talent in your line of work. You may also spend a considerable 
amount of time lobbying, testifying, advocating, and creating 
legislation for wildlife.

If you have just turned to this chapter, without reading Chapter 9 or 14, scan the career
areas in this chapter to identify any that interest you.
All of the career categories described in this chapter involve creativity in some form. The
section “If You Have a Good Eye” offers careers that capitalize on your eye for beauty and
perspective. The section “If You Want Your Work to Be Physical” lists careers that use your
body in some way. The section “If You Have an Ear for the Sound of Music” describes
careers that put your musical abilities to work.
If you’re unsure whether these three categories are a good ﬁt for you and your skills, refer
back to Worksheet 7-2 in Chapter 7 to see whether your Multiple Intelligence Proﬁle high-
lights these three career categories. You may also ﬁnd you’re interested in exploring the
communicating careers in Chapter 11 and the logical/scientiﬁc careers in Chapter 12.
Making the Most of This Chapter
Each of the following sections contains descriptions of different careers related to that par-
ticular category. See Figure 13-1 for an explanation of the information you ﬁnd in each
section of the career description.

If you’re going through Chapter 9, and looking at the careers in this chapter to expand your
list of possible careers, record all the career categories that appeal to you in Worksheet 9-6.
Don’t stop to investigate every career that catches your eye. For now you just need to focus
on using these career descriptions to enhance your list of possible careers. After you’ve
reduced your options a bit in Chapter 10, you can return to this chapter to explore your top
two career ideas.
If you’re reading Chapter 14, and using this chapter to understand your top two careers in
more depth, you may ﬁnd the professional associations good sources of current information
about the profession. You can visit an association’s Web site or call or write for more infor-
mation. After ﬁnding out what you can from the professional association and list of related
jobs, head back to Chapter 14 to discover other ways to gain more information about the
careers that interest you most.
As you read the career descriptions in this chapter, you may be struck by a career area or a

Working on a two-dimensional “canvas”
Although visual images have always had a place in society, the explosion of new technologi-
cal media has caused a surge in the use of visual imagery. You see photographs, video clips,
and animation just about anywhere and everywhere you look. These visual images, which
you see in entertainment, education, and advertisements, were designed by a person with
artistic capabilities.
Working on a three-dimensional “canvas”
Not all creative design happens on a two-dimensional surface. Some people with artistic tal-
ents visualize and work in three dimensions. For example, artists and people in the fashion
industries are masters at thinking in and working in 3-D. If this form of creativity is in your
blood, you can’t ignore it!
Photography
Related jobs
You blend artistic sense with technical knowledge to capture
photographic images that evoke a certain mood or feeling about
a person, place, or event. No matter what your subject, being in
the right place at the right time is the name of the game. The
explosion of new media outlets in entertainment, education,
communication, and marketing creates a growing and constant
demand for more visual images. Digital cameras and scanners
allow photographs to be processed, manipulated, edited, and
enhanced more readily than ever before. This change impacts
the work process and the creative parameters of the work.
Photography has many niches. Choose a niche that appeals to
you and fits your lifestyle, and then build your expertise!

Chapter 13: Thinking Outside the Box with Creative Careers

Creating environments
One form of 3-D creativity takes a sense of design and mixes it with spatial reasoning and
building. Most people with this combination of talents work with buildings and structures in
some way, through design, construction, or decorating.
Fashion design
Related jobs
You translate the pulse of the culture, times, and trends into
clothing and accessories the public wants to buy. You have
strong technical training; a good eye for color, line, and style;
excellent pattern-making skills; and a sense of what is
functional for your customers. For the majority of designers,
the road to success starts with learning the ropes and paying
dues in low-paying assistant positions. If you aren’t interested
in the high-stakes game of fashion design, but love the
industry, look into some of the more stable careers within the
industry, including fabric buyer, textile designer, merchandiser,
sample maker, quality control specialist, and image consultant.

throughout their careers, with a coach you can continue to
enhance your skills, which helps you land bigger and better
assignments. Doing voiceovers can be a good element of a
composite career as long as your other work is flexible.

By mixing your vocal talent with determination and perseverance,
you can create a viable singing career. To do so, you must have a
versatile voice, be able to sing any style of music, have the ability
to sight read, and exude confidence while performing. The key to
success is building a reputation for excellence and dependability.
As with most music careers, the hours are irregular, and travel is
frequent. Many vocalists make singing part of a composite career,
which lets them stabilize their income while still allowing them to
utilize their greatest asset.

Part III: Exploring Possible Career Directions 

Part IV
Bringing Your Dream 
Career to Life

In this part . . .
A
fter you have a good career idea or two in hand, this
part tells you how to investigate your options, using
online resources, offline materials, and conversations with
those in your field of interest. When you have a clear under-
standing of what’s entailed in your dream career, it’s time
to blend your ideal vision with the realities of how you live.
The last two chapters in this part help you chart your
course to bring your dream career to life.

Chapter 14
Researching Your Top Two Career Ideas
In This Chapter
 Staying focused on your top career ideas
 Making a list of your questions
 Compiling job and industry proﬁles
 Noting your feelings about your career choices
A
fter you have an intriguing career idea or two in mind (see Parts I through III of this
book to help you formulate some ideas), it’s time to deepen your understanding of
each one of them. Having an accurate perspective of your target careers is essential to veri-
fying that the careers match your needs.
The world is far too complex and changing far too fast to rely solely on your assumptions,
written material, or one person’s opinion about a career. To get an up-to-date picture of a
potential career, you need to gather information about the job tasks and the possible indus-
tries where those job tasks are needed from several online or hard copy sources.
The job proﬁles you develop in this chapter help you get a sense of the tasks, educational
requirements, and salary related to your top two career ideas. The next step is to explore
and proﬁle the industries that hire people in your target ﬁeld. For example, if you want to
write, you might start by looking at job titles that involve writing, such as technical writer,
copy editor, public relations, or sitcom writer. Then to get a full sense of these jobs, you’d
turn your attention to understanding the industries you might work in. As you’ll see, each
industry has its own character and culture. For instance, the publishing industry has a dif-
ferent culture, different requirements, and different opportunities than the news industry or
the entertainment industry.
Building your job and industry proﬁles is also likely to open up new avenues of exploration.
As you read various job proﬁles, you may discover a job title you hadn’t seen before, or you
may run into information about a trend that highlights an industry you hadn’t considered
before.
In Chapter 15 you expand your investigation by conducting informational interviews with
those who are part of your target professions and target industries.
Although you may already feel like you’ve hit pay dirt with one of your career ideas, devote
the time required to verify that your career idea does in fact ﬁt you and your lifestyle. In the
long run, doing this double check before you launch your job search, accept a job offer, or
start a business saves you time and money. In reality, it’s much easier to make a course 
correction while you’re still exploring your options than after you’ve already started imple-
menting your idea.

Keeping Your Eye on the Prize
As you move through this chapter, you explore your top two career ideas from several
angles. In addition to exploring related job proﬁles, you examine salary information, indus-
try descriptions, and input from relevant professional associations.
The more information you take in, the more insights you gain about the true nature of 
your top two career ideas and their viability. On one hand, the information you ﬁnd may
absolutely conﬁrm your impressions about your target careers. On the other hand, you may
be in for the shock of your life when you discover your picture of a career was totally off
base. (At this point you’ll be thanking your lucky stars that you did the research before you
launched into that career.) A third middle option is probably more likely to occur: You dis-
cover some information that excites you about the possibilities within a career and some
information that leaves you feeling a bit concerned. This mixed bag is common and nothing
to be alarmed about at this stage of the game.
I’ll be honest with you. This exploration phase can be overwhelming for several valid rea-
sons. I describe those reasons here, along with an antidote so you know how to focus your
energy when you feel so overwhelmed that you want to give up.
 Reason 1: You’re introduced to a vast new world of information with an inﬁnite number
of side roads, dead ends, and scenic routes that lead nowhere.
Antidote 1: Keep your focus on your top two career ideas to start your exploration.
Know that you can come back later to dabble in side road excursions.
 Reason 2: You’re stepping into the big unknown. Somewhere, out there, is your career,
but you have no idea where it is or how to ﬁnd it.
Antidote 2: Have trust and faith that each consciously chosen click on a Web site link
takes you closer to the career of your wildest dreams. Paying close attention when
something inside you signals interest and excitement is a good way to stay on target.
Listening to yourself when you feel repelled by an aspect of a career is another impor-
tant element of your exploration process. Revisit Chapter 2 for more details about
these internal focusing tools.
 Reason 3: You’re bombarded with new tidbits of information constantly. Each piece
that comes your way may sway you this way or that. One minute you feel this is the
best career ever. The next moment you think it’s the worst idea possible.
Antidote 3: Remember that you’re in the beginning of your exploration phase.
Although you’d love to have the ﬁnal answer yesterday, you don’t know enough to
make a good decision yet. Your best bet is to stay in an observing and recording mode,
calmly and consciously taking in all of the information and writing it down. Feel free 
to start making connections and seeing patterns and themes, but don’t — I repeat,
don’t — jump to any conclusions in this chapter.
 Reason 4: You’re anxious to get on with things. You want to get your resume out there
and start talking to people — even though you aren’t at all clear about your direction.
This scenario is a recipe for disaster. What happens when you get a job interview or,
worse, an offer for a job that turns out to be exactly the wrong move for you?
Antidote 4: Don’t spin your wheels like this. The time you invest in your exploration
saves you huge amounts of time, energy, sweat, and tears later in the journey. When
you’re ready to take action, you’ll feel clear, focused, and conﬁdent about your 
direction.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Your ﬁrst pass through this chapter is exploratory in nature. Your goal is to get a broad
enough view of each career idea to assess whether it’s a viable possibility to consider. Stay
open and alert as you do your research. This isn’t just a school assignment — it’s the foun-
dation of your new life. Honor the mix of discomfort and excitement that you feel. That mix
of emotions is common at this stage, honestly reﬂecting where you are at this stage of the
process. Keep an open, curious mind and practice sitting in the space of the unknown. Very
soon the clues start coming together, and your future comes into focus.
If your top two career ideas are business ideas or project descriptions, you may not be able
to ﬁnd an online job proﬁle or industry proﬁle that spells out exactly what you want to do.
For example, you aren’t likely to ﬁnd a proﬁle for a business to help others through the nec-
essary paperwork after a loved one dies or for a business that uses horse training to help
managers develop their leadership skills. Yet both these businesses exist. Your best path is
to do a broader Web search using keywords to see whether you can ﬁnd anyone else doing
something similar to what you want to do. Piece together as much information as you can in
the sections of this chapter and then head to Chapter 15 to start talking with others.
You may need to change tracks midway through the chapter if you ﬁnd that one of your
target career ideas dead-ends or leads in a direction that won’t work for you or your lifestyle.
For example, if you discover that your ideal career requires you to travel 80 percent of the
time, you (and your toddlers) may quickly determine that this isn’t the job for you after all.
If that happens, draw another one of your top ten career ideas forward or follow the trail of
a job proﬁle or industry proﬁle you’ve already looked at. By the end of the chapter, your top
two career ideas may or may not be the same ones you started with. The key is that they’re
the most viable, exciting, interesting, and intriguing ideas you’ve found so far.
If you want, after you’ve selected your top two contenders, you can read more proﬁles and
industry information to get as thorough a foundation as possible. At some point, however,
the Web resources will get repetitive, telling you what you already know. At that point,
you’re ready for Chapter 15.
In Chapter 15, you do some more in-depth, hands-on research in the form of conversations
and observations. One beneﬁt of taking the time to explore your career ideas in this chapter
is that you have ample opportunities to acquaint yourself with pertinent profession-speciﬁc
terminology. This knowledge is a plus during the next phase of your exploration. The more
comfortable you become with the language and nuances of your career ideas, the more
credibility you have as you talk with people about your target professions in Chapter 15.
Jotting Down Your Unanswered Questions
As you complete the job and industry proﬁles throughout this chapter, pay close attention
to questions that pop into your mind. Use Worksheet 14-1 to record the following:
 Anything that’s confusing or contradictory
 Anything you aren’t ﬁnding enough information about
 Things you’ve heard about the profession but aren’t able to conﬁrm
Although you may ﬁnd answers to some of your questions before you complete your career
exploration, recording your questions gives you a jump-start as you build your questions
for informational interviews in Chapter 15.

Chapter 14: Researching Your Top Two Career Ideas

Creating Job Profiles for Your Top Career Ideas
As you spend time exploring your career ideas, your main purpose is to conﬁrm that you
have a clear idea what’s entailed in each profession. To do this, use the resources described
in the following sections to begin building your job proﬁles in the worksheets that I provide.
What to look for
As you build each proﬁle, focus on conﬁrming what you know and discovering what you
don’t know about your career ideas. Researching what you don’t know is an obvious strat-
egy, but to be successful, you must also admit to yourself what you don’t yet know. Dig deep
to get the full scoop. As you gather information about the ﬁeld, pay extra attention to any
new information that shows you angles you haven’t thought of before.
A number of elements go into building a proﬁle of your career ideas. Each resource you
access provides another layer of information. Keep adding details until you’re conﬁdent
that you have a full understanding of the job you’re researching. Here’s the info you’ll need
to research in order to complete the job proﬁles in Worksheets 14-2 and 14-3. You may want
to make a few extra copies of these worksheets in case your discovery path takes you to
other job titles.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

 What the job entails: Describe the main tasks and responsibilities of the job.
 Skills you need: Identify the skills required to do this job.
 Recommended training: Make note of the training requirements for this job.
 Employment outlook: Record whatever information you ﬁnd about the outlook for 
this profession. Note the date the forecast was written so you can evaluate its current
relevance. If questions arise about future trends, add these questions to your list of
unanswered questions in Worksheet 14-1.
 Related job titles: Track related job titles to get a fuller picture of your options.
 Salary information: Record what you learn about the salary potential for this job. 
(In addition to the salary information you ﬁnd in online job proﬁles, see the section
“Taking a closer look at salary information,” later in this chapter.)
 Professional associations and other valuable resources: Keep a list of professional
associations and other valuable resources as you do your exploration. New books,
people, Web sites, businesses, and conferences you just happen to hear about in pass-
ing may be just the things that open the door to your future.
 Your impressions of this job: When your job proﬁle is ﬁlled out, take a moment to spell
out your ﬁrst impressions. Be sure to articulate the good, the bad, and the ugly. This
isn’t the time to gloss over warning signs.
Don’t let any single piece of information ﬂip you out. You may run across salary information,
employment outlook projections, education requirements, or workload descriptions that
either don’t ﬁt your picture or make you very nervous. Always corroborate key information
through several current sources before you react. In addition, if you’re excited about almost
everything else about the job, hang in there. In Chapters 16 and 17, you ﬁnd creative ways
to resolve trade-offs and possible conﬂicts. Don’t try to resolve these issues now. Just note
how you feel and keep exploring the possibilities.
Dawn, an art teacher from Pennsylvania, wants to use her creative talents to design some-
thing. Her biggest quandary is that she’s not sure what she wants to design. Because she
has to start somewhere, she’s decided to begin her investigation with the job of architect.
As she explored the Web sites in the following section, “Where to ﬁnd job proﬁles,” she
started building a proﬁle of the profession. Take a look at Figure 14-1 to review the way she
summarized the research she did. Notice that Dawn referenced certain key sites in her
notes so that she could go back later for more detail if she decided to explore this path.
Based on how she expressed her impression of this profession, I suspect she’s going to keep
exploring her options before she makes a ﬁnal decision about her future as an architect.

Where to find job profiles
In the past, you had to go to a library or a career center to ﬁnd thorough job proﬁles. With
the Internet, you’re just a click away from many extremely valuable resources.
Although you may be tempted to click on all of the interesting links you come across in 
your research, focus your ﬁrst round of research on your top two career ideas. A scattered
approach to this exploration quickly leaves you feeling confused and overwhelmed. Record
jobs that really catch your attention, and the corresponding Web pages, in Worksheet 14-4
so that you can come back later to explore them in detail.
When you locate a useful job proﬁle, bookmark it or save it to your list of favorites so you
can go back to it at a later date. Other options include printing the proﬁles and putting them
in a binder or starting a log of the Web sites you visit. Nothing is more frustrating than
knowing you saw a key piece of information somewhere on the Web but not recalling where
you saw it or how to ﬁnd it again.
The following Web sites provide the best online job proﬁles. Read the description of each
site to discover what information is in the proﬁles. I encourage you to check out several
sites to compare and contrast what the various sources say about your target careers.
 Occupational Outlook Handbook (www.bls.gov/oco/): On this site, each career pro-
ﬁle includes a description of the nature of the work, working conditions, employment
options, training and education requirements, job outlook, earnings, related occupa-
tions, and sources of additional information. You can access career proﬁles on this site
using an alphabetical index, the occupational clusters, or the site’s search engine.
 Wetfeet.com (www.wetfeet.com): Click on the Careers Proﬁles link, under Career
Research, to ﬁnd the job title that best ﬁts your career idea, and click on it. Each proﬁle
consists of ﬁve separate pages: career overview, requirements, job outlook, career
tracks, and compensation. Use the links just under the job title to access these pages.
To the right of each proﬁle is a list of additional resources, including proﬁles of related
industries, associations, and discussion boards.

Chapter 14: Researching Your Top Two Career Ideas

 Princeton Review (www.princetonreview.com/cte/search/careerSearch.asp):
Although primarily a resource for students making decisions about their education,
this site has 180 detailed proﬁles that consist of an unusual mix of information. The
ﬁrst page of each career proﬁle gives you a day in the life of a career, paying your dues,
and associated careers. Use the links on the left-hand navigational bar to explore qual-
ity of life two years, ﬁve years, and ten years out; past and future of the ﬁeld; statistics
about who is in the profession; salary information; what professionals read; movies
and books that feature the career; major employers; who you’re likely to associate
with; and key professional associations. If you use the “Search Careers and
Internships” search engine to hunt for a particular job title, the results provide all
direct hits and other related possibilities. You can also access the proﬁles through the
alphabetical listings. If you sign up as a member of the site, you can save your proﬁles
for later reference.
 Monster.com (http://jobprofiles.monster.com/): This site has 120 different job
proﬁles that include a description of the job, the necessary skills, the education
requirements, employment outlook, related careers, relevant key words, and related
articles. Each proﬁle also includes some interesting, and often obscure, factoids.
 America’s Career InfoNet (www.acinet.org/acinet/): This site provides a tremen-
dous amount of information about various facets of career exploration. Begin by
clicking on the Occupation Information button on the home page. After clicking on the
Occupation Proﬁle link, you can use one of two methods to search for your target job.
You can identify the relevant job family, then the occupation, and your state, or you
can enter the ﬁrst few letters of the job title. From there you can check off the parts of
the report you want to view. Each proﬁle includes a description of the work; state and
national wage information; knowledge, skills, and abilities required to do the job; tasks
and activities performed on the job; education and training levels; related occupation
proﬁles; and Web resources, including proﬁles on other Web sites. Each proﬁle includes
a box that leads to related content, including trends and possibly a related video. In the
Occupation Information section, you can also access lists of the occupations with the
fastest growth, most openings, largest employment, declining employment, and highest
salaries. Use these additional lists with caution if you’re just starting your research.
Too much information can be distracting. After you’re clear about your potential 
direction, check each of these lists to see whether your target career is listed. If, for
instance, your targeted career is on the declining employment list, you certainly want
to know that.
 Jobstar (www.jobstar.org/tools/career/spec-car.cfm): This site is a little differ-
ent from the others in this list. When you reach this Web site, you ﬁnd a list of career
ﬁelds. Click on the one of interest to ﬁnd a list of relevant Web sites. Each link on the
list takes you to a Web site created by those in the profession. Some sites are more
detailed than others. Some sites include descriptions from individuals who currently
work in the ﬁeld.
 Cornell University’s Career Zone (www.nycareerzone.org): After you pass through
the opening screen, run your cursor over each icon to read a brief description of that
career cluster. Then click on the career cluster that best matches your interests to ﬁnd
a list of jobs. Under each career cluster you ﬁnd a list of anywhere from 100 to 500 jobs,
but you can make the review process more manageable by sorting the jobs by required
education or expected wages by using the Advanced Search link. Each job proﬁle
includes a job description, interests, tasks, skills, knowledge, education, school pro-
grams, wages, job outlook, additional resources, and similar jobs. Videos accompany
some of the proﬁles. Because this site highlights jobs in New York State, the wages
and job outlook are speciﬁc to that state, but don’t let that deter you. The detailed
descriptions of each job and what’s entailed are clear and informative no matter
where you live.
176
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Plugging keywords, such as job titles, commonly used equipment and supplies, or profes-
sional awards, into your favorite Internet search engine can also lead to additional
information about a career, such as job announcements (keep track of interesting opportu-
nities, but don’t let them seduce you into applying for a job just yet), the Web site or blog of
someone who currently does the work, additional professional groups, informative articles
about the profession, resources for the tools and equipment these professionals use in their
work, and job boards for future reference. If your ﬁrst set of keywords doesn’t give you what
you want, try another keyword. Sometimes just a slight variation in the words you use in
your search can pull up a different set of links.
The career section of your local bookstore or the reference section in your local library may
also have some useful resources to help you gain a more thorough perspective on your
career ideas. Look for the following:
 The Occupational Outlook Handbook: Published by the U.S. Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics. This book provides the same information as its Web site
(see the preceding list), but in a book format.
 The Dictionary of Occupational Titles: Provided by the U.S. Department of Labor,
Employment Training Administration. It includes short descriptions of 12,741 occupa-
tions, which are organized by occupational categories. Each occupation is also coded
according to the work functions performed in each job. If you know from your explo-
ration that you like to work primarily with people, data, or things, paying attention to
these codes may expand your horizons.
Cool Careers For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Marty Nemko and Paul and Sarah Edwards
(Wiley), also offers lots of information about great careers.
Locating key professional associations
Professional associations provide another valuable source of career information about
occupations and industries. Whether you visit an association’s Web site or send for more
information, you gain valuable insights about training and education requirements, salary
standards, education sources, conferences, and local chapters by connecting with relevant
associations.
Start by visiting the associations you’ve already identiﬁed in your exploration thus far.
Check out the sites to ﬁnd out what you can about the professions and industries they
serve. Use the information to supplement the job proﬁles and industry proﬁles you’ve been
developing.
You might also locate your target career ideas in Chapters 11 through 13 to see if those
descriptions point you to a professional association you aren’t aware of yet.
If you want to search out associations that are even more closely related to your target
career ideas, visit the following Web sites:
 Weddles (www.weddles.com/associations/index.cfm): Organized by category, this
list of associations provides active links to a wide range of professional associations.
 The Internet Public Library (www.ipl.org/div/aon/): This guide to professional
associations begins with a list of broad categories. Begin with the category that is of
most interest and keep drilling down through the various levels of subheadings until
you reach the list of relevant associations.
177
Chapter 14: Researching Your Top Two Career Ideas

 Jobweb.com (www.jobweb.com/Career_Development/prof_assoc.htm): In addition
to being able to access a list of professional associations by category, this site also serves
as an access point to a very useful list of associations: the Gateway to Associations.
A powerful search tool on the Gateway to Associations site allows you to pull up profes-
sional associations by the name of the association, keywords, location, and category.
If you don’t know the name of the association, scan the drop-down list of categories.
After you specify your search criteria, a list comes up on the screen, and you can click
through to the most relevant associations.
If you don’t have access to the Internet, or you want to do additional ofﬂine research, ask
the reference librarian in your local library to direct you to the following resources:
 Encyclopedia of Associations: Published by The Gale Group, this resource lists
22,000 national and international associations. Each entry provides contact informa-
tion, a description of the purpose of the organization, its publications and afﬁliations,
and convention information. If you’re interested in regional, state, or local organiza-
tions, look for the volume dedicated to these groups.
 National Trade & Professional Associations Directory: Compiled by Columbia
Books Inc. each year, this index provides information about 7,500 trade associations,
professional societies, labor unions, and technical organizations. You can use this book
to ﬁnd contact information and a description of an association even if you only know
the acronym, subject area, or location of the organization.
Taking a closer look at salary information
Estimating the salary associated with a particular job title is a very complex operation.
Generally, your salary depends on a number of factors, including your job responsibilities,
performance, tenure, training, experience, the company’s size, company pay scales, the
industry, and your geographic location.
Rather than piecing together a salary estimate on your own or depending on the industry
grapevine, use one of the following three Web sites to obtain accurate, reliable salary esti-
mates based on the compilation of salary surveys from various research organizations and
government sources:
 Salary.com (www.salary.com): Enter your target job title into the Salary Wizard on the
home page or click on the link to All Titles to select from a list. Then enter your zip
code or choose from a list of states and cities. Identify your target job title from the list
provided. If you need more information to make your choice, read job descriptions by
using the link provided under the box listing job titles. Click on View a Basic Report to
see a graph showing the base salary for your area. Scroll to the bottom of the report,
and with one additional click, you can see how that salary compares to the national
average, to the salary for the same job in a different location, or to a related job in the
same location.
 Salaryexpert.com (www.salaryexpert.com): Select a job title or paste in a job
description of your target career, enter your location information, and click on Search.
On the next page, select View a Basic Report. The page that opens provides a report
summary at the top and then more details about the location-speciﬁc wages and the
national average wages. Scrolling down, you ﬁnd a description of the job and additional
sources of information. You can obtain a more detailed salary survey for more speciﬁc
job titles, if you’re willing to pay for the report.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

 America’s Career InfoNet (www.acinet.org/acinet/): Begin by clicking on the
Occupation Information link on the home page. After clicking on Occupation Proﬁle,
you can use one of two methods to search for your target job. You can identify the rele-
vant job family, then the occupation, and your state, or you can search for the career
with a few letters or keywords. From there you check off the wages information option.
The page that opens up shows you wage information for the state you selected and the
nation. Below the table, look for several links that give you an even bigger picture. One
link shows you how the wages for this occupation rank by state. You can also compare
these wages to those of a different job or compare the wages across states you select.
Your best ofﬂine resource for researching compensation trends is the American Salaries and
Wages Survey, published by The Gale Group on an annual basis. This book, which you can
ﬁnd in your library or career center, pulls data from over 300 sources to create geographic-
speciﬁc salary data for 2,660 occupation classiﬁcations and 4,800 individual jobs.
Creating Your Industry Profiles
Another facet to knowing your options is gaining more insight about the industries where
your favorite job function may be used. In some cases, the ﬁt between the job and industry
may be immediately obvious. In other situations, you may need to do some detective work
to ﬁnd the right job/industry match. Furthermore, an industry proﬁle may open up a new
line of exploration by pointing out job titles you haven’t seen before.
As you explore possible industries by using the resources included in this section, record
your discoveries in Worksheets 14-5 and 14-6. (You may want to make extra copies of these
worksheets in case you explore more than two industries.) Your proﬁle is likely to include
the following pieces of information.
 Description of the industry: Make note of the key elements that describe this industry.
 Training requirements: Record the kind of training and experience recommended
within the industry.
 Employment outlook: Describe the employment trends expected for this industry.
 Related job titles: List job titles that surface in your research.
 Professional associations and other valuable resources: Keep track of any resources
that may extend your knowledge of the industry, whether it’s a professional associa-
tion, a Web site, or an annual conference. In addition to the associations listed in the
proﬁles you read, refer to the section “Locating key professional associations,” earlier
in this chapter, to identify professional associations for your target industry.
 Your impressions of this industry: While the information is fresh, make note of your
impressions of the industry and what you like and don’t like about what you’ve 
discovered.

Chapter 14: Researching Your Top Two Career Ideas

Use the following resources to familiarize yourself with industries that intrigue you. Explore
what looks interesting even if you don’t immediately see a way to blend it with your favorite
functions.
 America’s Career InfoNet (www.acinet.org/acinet/): Begin by clicking on the
Industry Information link on the home page. After clicking on Industry Proﬁle, you can
use one of two methods to search for your target job. You can locate the appropriate
industry sector or type in the ﬁrst few letters of the industry of interest. From there,
choose the most relevant subsector or industry listed. You may drill down through sev-
eral layers before you reach the proﬁle information. There you ﬁnd a description of the
industry and industry employment trends. At the bottom of the proﬁle you can follow
additional links to an occupation proﬁle. In the Industry Information section, you can
also access lists of the industries with the fastest growth, largest employment, and
declining employment. Use these additional lists with some restraint if you’re just start-
ing your exploration. After you’re clear about your potential direction, check each of
these lists to see whether your target industry is listed.
 Wetfeet.com (www.wetfeet.com): Click on the Industry Proﬁle link, under Career
Research, to reach the industry proﬁles. Each proﬁle consists of four separate pages:
industry overview, love-hate or the workplace, major players, job descriptions and tips
or job proﬁles and hiring. To the right of each proﬁle is a list of additional resources,
including proﬁles of related jobs, associations, and discussion boards.
 Career Guide to Industries (www.bls.gov/oco/cg/home.htm): Offered as a compan-
ion to the job proﬁles of the Occupational Outlook Handbook, this site provides
detailed career information by industry. You can browse through a list of industries on
the right side of the home page or use the CGI Search/A-Z Index in the upper right-hand
corner of the screen. Each industry proﬁle includes signiﬁcant points about the indus-
try, the nature of the industry, working conditions within the industry, employment
options, occupations within the industry, training and advancement, earnings, outlook,
and additional sources of information.
The career section of your local bookstore or the reference section in your local library may
also have some useful resources to help you gain a more thorough perspective on indus-
tries. Look for The Career Guide to Industries, published by the U.S. Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics. This guide describes careers from an industry perspective and
includes the nature of the work, job qualiﬁcations, job outlook, and income potential for 42
diverse industries. This resource provides the same information as the online counterpart.
Paying Attention to Your Gut Reaction
Now that you’ve researched your career ideas and written down your discoveries, how do
you feel when you think about working in this job or industry? Do you feel drawn to one
more than the other? Do you hesitate or pull away from one? Just notice how you feel and
write down your overall impressions in Worksheet 14-7.
Some feelings of trepidation and nervousness are natural. You are, after all, doing this
research to explore the possibility of changing your career. While you’re in the process of
discovering your future, you’re likely to feel a bit uncomfortable with all the unknowns still
in the equation. To keep your anxiety under control, stay focused on the step in front of
you. For instance, if you’re investigating your target careers, you aren’t ready to make any
decisions. In fact, you can’t make a good, solid decision about your future until you have a
good grasp of your target career.
182
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Use the following list to decide how to proceed from here:
 If something about one of your career ideas leaves you cold, bored, or annoyed,
return to your Top Ten list in Chapter 10 to decide what other career you want to
explore.
 If you’ve discovered something about a career idea that makes it completely
unpalatable to you, pull another career forward from your Top Ten list.
 If you aren’t sure about one of your career ideas but are still intrigued by it, keep
exploring. Don’t step away too early in the process. You may need to talk with people
doing the job to get a good sense of whether it works for you. Investigate the parts of
the job that intrigue you. Use Chapter 15 to gather more information about the career
by talking with others in the ﬁeld.
 If you’re curious about one of the job proﬁles or industry proﬁles that you stumbled
upon during your exploration, take some time to look it over. If it’s intriguing enough
to replace one of your top two career ideas, shift your priorities.

Chapter 15
Asking the Right Questions 
about Your Top Two Careers
In This Chapter
 Compiling a list of questions about your target career
 Coming up with names of people to interview
 Remaining objective
 Interviewing initial contacts and people in your ideal career
 Keeping notes about what you discover
 Changing your mind about possible careers
Your objective in this chapter is to expand your knowledge about your target careers,
work out any inconsistencies you’ve uncovered, resolve any mysteries you’ve run into,
and gather more ﬁrsthand information about the professions, jobs, and industries you are
most interested in. By the end of this chapter, you want to have as full a picture as possible
about your top two career ideas.
After you gain a basic understanding of your target careers by reading job proﬁles, exploring
industry descriptions, and ﬁnding relevant professional associations (Chapter 14 can help),
it’s time to bring a human touch to your exploration. The people who work in your target
profession or industry offer current, geographically relevant, and personalized information
that enriches how you see your target career.
You can use informational interviews for a number of purposes, including trying on a new
career, learning about a particular company, exploring a speciﬁc work structure, or ﬁnding
out what it’s like to work as a solo entrepreneur. How you approach your informational
interviews depends on where you are in your exploration:
 If you’re exploring whether a profession, occupation, or industry is a good ﬁt for you,
proceed with this chapter.
 If you think you’ve decided the direction you want to take, perhaps based on your
research in Chapter 14, I encourage you to continue with this chapter. Adding the per-
sonal perspective of your contacts gives you a richer, more realistic view of your goal.
Your informational interviews are going to be more successful and meaningful if you con-
duct them after you have a general base of knowledge about your targeted career interests.
If you haven’t worked through Chapter 14 yet, I encourage you to take some time to read
about your career ideas before you engage in any informational interviews. Those you 
contact will know whether you’ve done your homework prior to talking with them by the
questions you ask, the words you use, and the questions you don’t know to ask. Earn their
respect and conﬁdence by being prepared and informed before you approach them.

Later, in Chapters 18 and 19, you may also use informational interviews to ask questions
about the more speciﬁc aspects of your plan to ﬁnd a new job, start your business, or return
to school for more training.
Building Your List of Questions
The questions you include in your informational interviews depend on the research you’ve
done up to this point. As you begin creating your list of questions in Worksheet 15-1, con-
sider what you’ve already discovered about your top two careers.

 Do you need more information about what a job entails, the skills a job requires, 
the training you may need, or the outlook for salary or employment (refer to
Worksheets 14-2 and 14-3 in Chapter 14)?
 Do you need more information about the industry you’re interested in (refer to
Worksheets 14-5 and 14-6)?
 Has your research provided conﬂicting or confusing information about a job or indus-
try that you’d like to clarify?
 Do you have any unanswered questions about a job or industry (refer to Work-
sheet 14-1)?
 Is there anything else you’d like to know to help you answer this question: Is this
career a good ﬁt for me?
The following questions may also provide helpful ideas as you build your list of questions
for your informational interviews:
 The profession in general
• What is the outlook for this profession?
• What training or education is required?
• What sort of advancement possibilities exist?
 A speciﬁc job
• What is your day like?
• What are your key job responsibilities?
• What are your most favorite and least favorite parts of your job?
 The industry in general
• What is the long-term outlook for this industry?
• What is at the cutting edge of this industry?
• What are the pros and cons of working in this industry right now?
 The form of work
• What are the pros and cons of your schedule?
• How did you negotiate your ﬂexible work arrangement?
• Did you experience any unexpected surprises when you started this schedule?
 The lifestyle
• How does this job impact your life?
• How much ﬂexibility do you really have?
• How much travel should I expect?
 The contact’s career path
• How did you get into this ﬁeld?
• What jobs have you held?
• Do you know anyone who entered this ﬁeld with my background?
187
Chapter 15: Asking the Right Questions about Your Top Two Careers

Because each informational interview should last only 20 to 30 minutes, you won’t be 
able to ask each contact all of your questions. Instead, you’ll need to prioritize your 
questions and preselect the questions that each contact is likely to be best qualiﬁed to
answer.
As you gain more insight on your general questions about each profession, turn your 
attention to more speciﬁc elements of your target careers. When possible, ask each 
question in several informational interviews to obtain different perspectives on the 
same issue.
Creating a List of Contacts
With a list of questions in hand, you’re ready to start locating and talking with people who
work in the careers you’re investigating. But how do you ﬁnd those people?
To get the ball rolling, make a list of the people you know, using the prompts in Work-
sheet 15-2 to stimulate your thinking. As you scan your e-mail inbox and your address book
for ideas, think about current contacts, people you knew in the past, and people you know
through professional networking groups or social groups. Write down as many names as
you can. At this early stage, don’t worry about whether they know anything about your
target ﬁeld. Instead, keep your focus on those you know to be well connected, because
they’re the contacts that are most likely to put you in touch with the largest number of
people who can help you most.
Never underestimate who your friends know. For all you know, your friend’s uncle is the 
CEO of a company that specializes in the work you want to do. You never know until 
you ask!
Keep track of your contacts as your list grows. Later in your journey, you access your 
network again as you search for job openings or build your new business.

Chapter 15: Asking the Right Questions about Your Top Two Careers

Staying Objective in Your Quest
During your informational interviews, remember that you’re meeting with each person to
gather information to help you better understand a potential career. Follow this advice to
achieve your objective:
 Confront your worst fears: Remove your rose-colored glasses and ask the tough ques-
tions you don’t really want the answers to. Your goal must be to gather as accurate a
picture as possible about your target profession, job, or industry. If, for instance, you’re
worried about salary potential or the long-term outlook for the profession, ask the ques-
tion and face the truth. Now is not the time to play hide-and-seek from the truth.
 Test your assumptions: If you think something is true about your target career, based
on your prior investigations, ask questions to conﬁrm or disprove what you think you
already know. Perhaps you may have developed some assumptions about the level of
education required to do the job. Ask the question so you can conﬁrm your beliefs
before you’re set to take action.
Whenever possible, conduct at least two or three informational interviews before you make
any pivotal decisions about your career. Compare what you hear from different sources and
send a follow-up e-mail to your contacts to explore anything that doesn’t quite add up.
Stepping into Your First Round 
of Informational Interviews
Although the thought of asking people to talk with you about their professions may be a bit
daunting at ﬁrst, don’t let your fear or discomfort stop you. In my experience, people are
generally happy to talk with you as long as you’re genuinely interested in listening to them.
To keep from feeling overwhelmed by the process, choose ﬁve people from your list in
Worksheet 15-2 whom you feel comfortable just calling or e-mailing out of the blue. This ﬁrst
round of informational interviews tends to be quite informal and helps you build conﬁdence
in yourself and in the process.
When you reach out to your ﬁrst ﬁve contacts, explain that you’re exploring a new career
and you’d like to ask them a few questions. Assure them that even if they don’t know about
the career speciﬁcally, they can help you out by listening to you, giving you their honest
feedback about your interview style, and pointing you in the direction of contacts who are
familiar with your ﬁeld. Set up a time to meet in person, if possible, for coffee or a walk.
When you get together, open the conversation the same way you would if you were meeting
with a professional contact. If the person is familiar with your target career, ask a few ques-
tions from your initial list in Worksheet 15-1. In addition to paying attention to the answers,
notice how effectively you communicate what you’re looking for. If your contact seems con-
fused by anything you’ve said, reword your question or ask the person what was unclear.
The purpose of these interactions is not only to give you information but also to help you
practice and polish your spiel.
If your contact doesn’t know much about your target ﬁeld or industry, ask if she’ll role-play
with you so you have an opportunity to practice asking your questions.
At the end of your interviews, always ask your contacts whether they know anyone who is
familiar with your ﬁeld of interest or might know people in the ﬁeld. If you get a name, be sure
190
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

to obtain the person’s contact information as well as permission to say you were referred.
This one question makes the size of your network snowball. You can even be more direct and
ask whether your contact knows anyone who works in a particular company or is a member
of a speciﬁc association.
Record the results of your ﬁrst round of interviews in Worksheet 15-3. (Make extra copies of
this worksheet so you have one for each of your ﬁrst-round interviews.) Focus on the content
of what you discovered during the interview. Record your contact’s pertinent information, the
questions you asked, and the answers your contacts gave you. Make note of any contacts
they provided you as well.

After you complete your informational interview, write a thank-you note to your contact and
mail it — snail mail — within 48 hours. Later, as you shift your focus or make your ﬁnal deci-
sion about your career direction, send another note to keep your contact updated. Use the
bottom portion of the worksheet to track which notes you’ve sent and when you sent them.
One reason to conduct a ﬁrst round of informational interviews before you talk to your high
potential contacts is that you ﬁnd out what works and what doesn’t work with a bit of prac-
tice. Take some time to review your ﬁrst ﬁve interviews in Worksheet 15-4. Recording what
you learn means that you’re less likely to make the same mistakes in the next round of 
interviews.

Moving on to Your Second Round 
of Informational Interviews
After you smooth out the rough edges and feel more comfortable with the informational
interview process, begin your second round of informational interviews. At this stage, you
begin talking with people you don’t know well or at all.
Use the following steps to set up and conduct your informational interviews:
1. Think about the information you still need to discover about your target career.
Scan your contact list to identify those who are well connected or in a position to 
provide you with information relevant to your current objective, whether you’re
trying to ﬁnd out more about a profession, job, or industry. You can select names
from Worksheet 15-1 or begin to contact people whom your ﬁrst round of contacts
referred you to.
If your personal network doesn’t produce the kinds of contacts you need, consider
contacting people through an alumni group, sorority or fraternity, or career center.
These organizations often offer career networks as part of their services. In addition,
online networking systems, such as Ryze (www.ryze.com) or Linked In (www.
linkedin.com), may be of assistance.
2. Decide how you’ll introduce yourself to each contact.
Carefully craft your introductory sentence or paragraph so that it conveys who you are
and why you’re calling or writing. This statement must be clear and concise and tell
the contact who you are and why you’re contacting them. For instance, you could say,
“Jennifer Davey recommended that I contact you. I’m in the process of exploring a new
career in dune buggy construction. I understand from Jennifer that you have experi-
ence in this ﬁeld. Would it be possible to arrange a time for an informational interview
in the next two weeks?”
Of course your exact words will reﬂect your interests and be appropriate for the com-
munication channel you’re using to connect with your contact. If you’re calling your
contact, always have a concise phone message at the tip of your tongue. Nothing makes
a worse ﬁrst impression than a message full of stammers and uhs.
3. Make your initial contact with a letter, an e-mail, or a phone call.
If you’re contacting people you’ve known in the past, include a reference to the location
or event where the two of you met. With permission from your original contacts, use
their names in your initial communication with contacts they’ve given you (as in the
example in Step 2). If you do need to contact someone cold, be polite yet persistent.
Even if you run into what seems like an endless series of nos, just keep reaching out
on a regular basis. Your perseverance may pay off in surprising ways in the long run.
4. Set up a 20- to 30-minute appointment.
If given the choice, meet with your contact in person at her workplace. Getting the
experience of being in your contact’s work environment may provide you with informa-
tion you couldn’t get from asking a question. In fact, the setting may even stimulate a
question or two. If meeting in person isn’t possible, set up a phone appointment. As a
last resort, you can conduct an informational interview by e-mail if that’s the only way
to obtain the information you need.
193
Chapter 15: Asking the Right Questions about Your Top Two Careers

5. Prepare for your informational interview.
Take time before your appointment to lay out the questions you want to ask this partic-
ular contact based on her background, position, and training. Use Worksheet 15-5 to
plan and guide your interview. (Before you begin writing, make a number of copies
of Worksheet 15-5 so you can use the worksheet for subsequent interviews as well.)
Although you should plan to spend 20 to 30 minutes interviewing any one contact,
create a thorough list of questions so that you’re prepared if you ﬁnd that the person’s
expertise differs slightly from what you expected or you have the unexpected opportu-
nity to talk longer than originally planned.
6. Arrive early, dressed professionally for your informational interview (even if you
know your contact personally).
You don’t want to arrive rushed and harried, so plan extra time for trafﬁc tie-ups and
parking problems. Use your extra time to breathe and take in the environment.
7. Conduct your interview.
Upon meeting your contact, introduce yourself and thank her for agreeing to meet for
the informational interview. Your contact is likely to feel more comfortable if she knows
that you’re sticking to your word and not angling for a job. In one or two sentences,
describe the focus of the interview. For instance, you might say, “Thank you for meet-
ing with me to discuss interior design” or you might say “I appreciate the time you’ve
made in your schedule to meet with me. To make the most of our time together, I’d like
to focus our conversation on upcoming opportunities within the photography industry.”
Then begin asking the questions you developed in Worksheet 15-5. If your contact’s
comments bring up new angles you hadn’t considered before, fold a few new questions
into the conversation, but don’t abandon your original questions entirely. If you can,
add the new questions to the bottom of Worksheet 15-5 during the interview so it will
be easier to re-create the full content of the interview in Worksheet 15-6.
At the beginning of your interview, ask your contact if she minds if you take notes.
If you plan to take notes, come prepared with professional-looking paper and pen.
Focus on getting enough of the main points down on paper so that that you can ﬁll
in the details on Worksheet 15-6 after the interview. On the other hand, don’t take so
many notes that you slow the interview to a crawl. Focus on getting the key words or
phrases down on your pad of paper to serve as memory triggers.
Before your time runs out, ask your contact if she knows others who might provide you
with valuable information. Jot any contacts and their contact information at the bottom
of Worksheet 15-5.
If you’re still doing informational interviews, it’s too early to be making any binding
career decisions. Focus your attention on verifying that your target career is a good ﬁt
for you. If your contact mentions a job opening in conversation, tell her you’d like to
hear more about it after the informational interview is complete. Don’t allow the infor-
mational interview to become a job interview. Participating in a job interview when you
aren’t sure the career is a good ﬁt for you is like playing with ﬁre. (However, if you’ve
completed enough informational interviews to know that you’re leaning toward this
career, explore the opportunity with your eyes and ears wide open. If a fantastic job
offer does come your way, evaluate it very carefully before you make a ﬁnal decision.
Refer to Chapters 16 and 19 for help in thinking through whether the career is a good
ﬁt for you and your life.)
8. Complete the interview professionally.
Pay attention to the time so that you can bring the interview to a close at the agreed
upon time. Thank your contact for her time, shake hands if you’re meeting in person,
and leave the premises. If you happen to know someone at the location, don’t turn
194
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

your visit into a social call. Leave the location with the same professionalism with
which you conducted the interview. Remember to make time in your schedule to sit
down immediately to record as many details as possible in Worksheet 15-6 in the next
section.

9. Thank those who talk to you, even if your conversation only lasts ﬁve minutes.
Follow up with a handwritten thank-you note (not an e-mail) to your key contacts. Use
the note to thank them for taking the time to talk with you, for the information they
shared, and for the additional contacts they provided you. If you have progress to
report, let them know how they helped you move forward. (You can track whether
you’ve sent your thank-you notes at the bottom of Worksheet 15-6.)

If you refocus your goal, write another note to your contacts. Sharing your new direc-
tion may encourage your contacts to think of a new set of referrals for you.
Later, when you’re clear about your long-term goal, your informational interview 
contacts may be some of your best sources for job leads. Because you’ve already
established a pattern of communicating with them, sending a note that describes
the kind of position you’re looking for is a completely natural next step.
Recording Your Discoveries about Each Career
Immediately after your meeting, record your discoveries in detail in Worksheet 15-6. In your
summary include the following information:
 The contact you spoke with: At the top of Worksheet 15-6, record your contact’s par-
ticulars and something about the interview or interviewer that brings the conversation
right back to you. Perhaps it’s the fuchsia suit, a picture of the Rocky Mountains, or
your contact’s wild sense of humor that caught your attention.
 The questions you asked: Although it’s obvious in the moment what questions you
posed, your mind may not retain the actual content of each informational interview
several weeks later. Writing down the questions that you asked also helps you know
how to interpret what your contact said during the interview.
 The answers you heard: Immediately after your interview, you may not think that
recording everything your contact said is that important, but after you’ve talked to sev-
eral contacts, you’ll be happy to have a detailed summary of what transpired in each
interview. Using your contact’s own words, when possible, helps you compare and con-
trast what various contacts have said. If you run out of space on this worksheet, just
add an additional page to capture the thoughts and ideas expressed in the interview.
 The contacts you were referred to: Make a note at the bottom of your summary to
indicate what actions you need to take to obtain the contact information for the new
referrals. Do you need to send your contact an e-mail to receive the contact informa-
tion or do you need to call a company to track down the contact?
Fill out a new copy of Worksheet 15-6 for each person you talk with. Keep your summaries
in a folder or binder so you can review them after you’ve spoken with several contacts.

Synthesizing What You Know So Far
At a certain point, the information you receive from your contacts conﬁrms what you’ve
already discovered, and the time has come to consolidate what you know.
Set aside some quiet time to reread all of the informational interviews you’ve conducted
thus far. Record new discoveries in Worksheet 15-7 so you can see them all in one place.
As you review your newfound nuggets of information and your original job and industry
proﬁles, you should have a fairly good understanding of your target careers.
Take stock of how you feel about your options. Are you leaning toward one more than the
other, torn between the two ideas, or obsessing over a few lingering questions you have
about whether the career will really work for you?
Don’t rush into a ﬁnal decision, just yet. Instead move into Chapter 16 to look for the best
way to blend your ideal career idea with your preferred lifestyle and work environment

Shifting Gears Midstream
If you discover at some point during your informational interviews (or your online research
in Chapter 14) that the direction you’re moving in causes you to drag your feet, stop and
take a good look at what’s going on.
To make a successful career change, you must feel the inner drive to go after it, so don’t
stay committed to an idea just because you’ve been interested in it in the past.
If your career idea has lost some of its luster, ask yourself the following questions to deter-
mine what’s going on:
 What caused your interests to shift?
 Is there a subtle change you can make in your plan to bring it back to life?
 What catches your attention these days?
Can you do something to reignite your interest, or is changing your goal the answer?
Changing direction now is better than waiting until you’ve started a new career or quit your
current position. Furthermore, admitting that you want to change your direction doesn’t
mean you have to start from scratch! You’re already way ahead of the game. Based on what
you already know about yourself, your needs, your interests, and your ideas, you can easily
update your focus and ﬁnd a direction that better suits you.
If you feel uncomfortable about a particular part of your career puzzle, the best place to
start is to revisit the relevant chapter to rethink what you need.
 If something has shifted in your personal life, review Chapters 3 and 4.
 If you’ve discovered something new about your work environment needs, revisit
Chapters 5 and 6.
 If your passions or interests have modiﬁed or become clearer, return to Chapters 7 
and 8.
 If you need to expand your career options because your ﬁrst picks didn’t pan out, 
take another look at your brainstorming in Chapter 9 and your top ten careers in
Chapter 10.
Just a small, subtle shift in your approach may help you get back on track or point you
toward a new, more viable path.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Chapter 16
Merging Your Personal Life 
with Your Dream Career
In This Chapter
 Revisiting your personal needs
 Reviewing your work environment needs
 Comparing your needs with your dream career ideas
 Choosing the best career format
 Imagining yourself in your new career
 Identifying possible conﬂicts
 Finding the blend that works best
T
hroughout this book, I encourage you to focus on your ideal career and lifestyle, putting
aside thoughts of whether any particular idea is feasible or not. In your exploration of
potential careers, you’ve no doubt found aspects of your needs and desires that clash to
some degree. This chapter helps you identify where your needs and desires are compatible
and where they are in conﬂict, and then offers advice on how to blend all the pieces into a
career picture that works for you both professionally and personally.
One way to visualize this process is to imagine working on a 3D puzzle in which one dimen-
sion is your personal needs, another reﬂects your work environment needs, and the third is
the profession that best captures your passions and interests. Your goal is to discover how
these three dimensions intersect in a way that ﬁlls as many of your needs as possible.
In some cases, all the pieces of your dream career puzzle may fall into place relatively
easily. In other cases, you may have a harder time ﬁguring out how it all ﬁts together.
Chapter 17 helps you ﬁnd creative ways to blend your dreams and your reality when
pieces of your puzzle are in conﬂict.
Just as in doing a jigsaw puzzle, synchronizing your ideal with your reality may require you
to turn the pieces around several times to get them all to ﬁt. As you work the puzzle, stay as
open as you can to seeing solutions that may not be obvious at ﬁrst.

Updating Your Personal Must-Haves
Before you delve into how to move your ideal career into reality, take a moment to remem-
ber what you need for yourself and your family.
The best way to do this is to review what you recorded about your personal style in Chapter 3
and your personal life and needs in Chapter 4. Start with the summaries in the following
worksheets and then move to the individual activities in each chapter if you’d like a deeper
perspective.
 Worksheet 3-11 is your summary of all you discovered about what’s uniquely you from
your personality traits and your values to your reasons for working.
 Worksheet 4-4 is your synopsis of your wish list for your personal life and includes
descriptions of how you want to live and how you like to spend your personal time.
If you started this book at the beginning and have worked your way through to this point,
you’ve spent a lot of time reﬂecting on yourself and what you want, so you may know more
about yourself now than you did when you completed Chapters 3 and 4. As you review
Worksheets 3-11 and 4-4, add new discoveries, reﬁne the wording of existing comments, and
delete things you know aren’t true anymore so that the result is a current and complete pic-
ture of your needs.
With your needs fresh in your mind, begin creating a picture of how you want your life to
be. Your description should include elements of your lifestyle that you’ve found to be non-
negotiable — from an ideal point of view, you would not sacriﬁce these elements of your
lifestyle for your career because without them, life just wouldn’t work for you. Perhaps
you’ve discovered you want to be home with your children when they get out of school, you
want to travel extensively, or you want to split your time between two locations. Whatever
your dream, start sketching it out on paper. While you’re at it, include any non-negotiable
aspects of your personality, whether it’s your creativity, your desire to make a difference, or
your love of the outdoors. The more you know about what you really want, the more likely
you are to craft such a life.
Record your picture as best you can in Worksheet 16-1, using a paragraph format or a series
of bullet points. Taking the time to revisit and identify the elements of your personal life
that feel non-negotiable helps you update and deepen your understanding of what you 
want in life. Holding this picture as you proceed through this chapter helps you make good 
decisions.
For the best results, keep your ideal thinking cap on for this activity, even if you don’t think
what you want is possible. Chapter 17 helps you make sense of the parts of your picture
that seem to be in conﬂict. Say, for instance, you want to be home with your kids after
school and you want to travel extensively. Although these desires seem contradictory and
impossible to fulﬁll, don’t give up quite yet. With some creativity and ingenuity, you may
just ﬁnd a way to get the best of both lifestyles.
If you haven’t yet worked through Chapters 3 and 4, look at the categories listed in
Worksheets 3-11 and 4-4 to get a sense of the elements covered in those chapters. Then
describe, in Worksheet 16-1, your best picture of who you are and how you want to live.
Don’t eliminate or downplay any element of your ideal life at this point just because it seems
unlikely that you can create it. The truth is that if you back away from that ideal now, you’ll
never have an opportunity to experience what you want. If you keep your ideal in mind, you
may be surprised by the opportunities that take you a step closer to your dream life.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Refining Your Ideal Work Needs
The next piece of the puzzle is to understand the kind of work environment that supports you
at work. To do this, review how you described your ideal work arrangement in Chapter 5 and
your ideal workplace in Chapter 6. Start with the summaries in the following worksheets.
If you want to do a more thorough review, take yourself through those chapters again, updat-
ing and reﬁning your responses as you go.
 Worksheet 5-7 is your summary of all you discovered about your ideal work format,
from your schedule and contract to your pay and beneﬁts.
 Worksheet 6-13 is your synopsis of your wish list for your workplace, from the com-
pany and location to your colleagues and managers.
Begin to pull together an image of your ideal work arrangement and location in Work-
sheet 16-2. Again, feel free to express your thoughts in a paragraph or a series of bullet
points.
If you haven’t yet worked through Chapters 5 and 6, look at the categories listed in
Worksheets 5-7 and 6-13 to get a sense of the elements covered in those chapters. Then
describe, in Worksheet 16-2, your best picture of your ideal work arrangement and 
environment.

Chapter 16: Merging Your Personal Life with Your Dream Career

After you’re clear about the work environment that works for you, add your family’s needs
into the mix. Are there any subtle, or not so subtle, shifts you need to make to envision a
work format that enables you to ﬂourish and your family to thrive? Record these ideas in
Worksheet 16-3 in a paragraph or with bullet points.
If you ﬁnd a conﬂict between the environment you need for yourself and the work format
you need to meet your family’s needs, note your observation in Worksheet 16-6 at the end of
the chapter. Don’t let your observation of this conﬂict stop you. Identifying potential con-
ﬂicts is an inherent part of bringing your dream career puzzle into focus. In Chapter 17 you
discover how to work with such clashes.
Finding Compatibility and Conflicts between
Your Needs and Your Dream Career
The ﬁnal element of your dream career puzzle is the career itself. If you worked through
Chapter 10, you identiﬁed your top two career ideas, and if you read Chapters 14 and 15,
you explored those careers in detail to increase your understanding of the realities of your
target professions.
If you know the potential upside and downside to each of your career options, you can com-
pare how the two careers ﬁt your needs. (If you don’t have this information about your target
careers, then you may want to take a look at Chapters 14 and 15 before you proceed.) Use
Worksheets 16-4 and 16-5 to evaluate how well each career matches your personal needs and
work environment needs. In each worksheet, you ﬁnd a column for each target career and a
list of all the elements you reviewed to get a sense of your personal and your environment
needs. By the end of this section, you have a two-page proﬁle of how each career stacks up
regarding your needs.
To create a quick visual snapshot, use the following codes to identify the match potential:
 If you ﬁnd a point of compatibility, meaning that your needs and the realities of the
career are similar, put a + in the relevant box
 If you ﬁnd a potential conﬂict where your needs and the realities of the career clash,
put a – (minus sign) in the box

Make notes in each box if doing so helps you keep track of what you’re rating.
Be as honest as you can in assessing how well each career matches your needs. Inﬂating the

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

As you review Worksheets 16-4 and 16-5, begin by looking at the overall pattern. Does one
career seem more compatible with your life than the other? Are the two careers similar or
dissimilar in how they match up with your needs?
Then begin a more detailed review by looking at one career at a time. Take note of the conﬂicts
(the minus signs) and the areas where you aren’t sure (the question marks) how the career
might blend with your life. This is where you start working with individual pieces of the puzzle
to see how you might increase the likelihood of the career ﬁtting you and your needs.
Ask yourself the following questions about each target career to begin pulling your puzzle
pieces into place:
 Is your assessment accurate? Your assessment may be skewed by your assumptions or
misinformation. Do what you can to conﬁrm that your assessment is on target by doing
a bit more online research or talking with your informational interview contacts to
double-check the accuracy of your assumptions. For instance, sometimes my clients
are convinced that their target career won’t provide the salary they need and that
there’s no way to make that path work. With further investigation, they discover their
target career can be linked with another business to make it more proﬁtable, or they
ﬁnd that a particular niche has great income potential. Even if you think you’re right,
do your research to be sure. This advice holds true whether you’re convinced that
your target career is a brilliant idea or a questionable one. You really don’t know the
truth until you search for it.
 How critical is your need in this area? Is this need a must-have or a nice-to-have ele-
ment of your picture? Are you willing to deal with this trade-off to get the other results
that are a great ﬁt?
 Do you see a conﬂict arising between two parts of your pictures? Can you identify a
creative way to have the best of both worlds — having your needs met and working in
the career of your choice? For now, record any conﬂicts you ﬁnd in Worksheet 16-6.
Chapter 17 walks you through a brainstorming process to help you ﬁnd creative solu-
tions for just this situation.
After completing your detailed assessment of how well each career option ﬁts your lifestyle
and your work needs, are you coming to any conclusions? Have you narrowed the ﬁeld to
just one option, or are both options still in the running? Regardless of whether you’re look-
ing at one option or two (be assured it really doesn’t matter at this point), your goal in the
rest of this chapter is the same — to juggle the characteristics of each career idea and your
lifestyle to discover the best ﬁt. Although the following sections are written as though you’re
focusing on one career, you may do the same exercises with both of your options to help
you reﬁne your thinking on both careers at once.
Homing In on the Right Career Format for You
Now that you have an overall assessment of how well your career options meet your per-
sonal and work environment needs, you can see at a glance which areas are rubbing the
wrong way. One way to bring your dream career and your personal needs and desires into
better alignment is to expand how you think about the work format of your dream career.
Sometimes looking at your target career in a different work format alleviates some of the
conﬂicts between your work and your life.
207
Chapter 16: Merging Your Personal Life with Your Dream Career

Take a look at the following examples to get a sense of how this works:
 A scientist can work in a lab, the ﬁeld, a think tank, a research facility, a start up, or a
manufacturing setting. In addition to doing basic research, a scientist might develop a
product or process, serve as an expert witness, or assess the quality of the company’s
output.
 A writer may work as a freelancer, on staff at a newspaper or magazine, in a public 
relations ﬁrm, in house as a technical writer or editor, or as a marketing consultant
for small business owners.
In each case, the career has several work formats to choose from. Each format has inherent
pluses and minuses regarding factors such as the work schedule, the company characteris-
tics, and the pay structure. If two people have the same career interests, one might feel quite
at home in one setting and like a ﬁsh out of water in another, while the other person might
feel best in an entirely different setting. By fully exploring the various work formats associ-
ated with your target professions, you can choose the option that best ﬁts you personally.
Think about the format options that might be possible with your dream career. As you
entertain different formats, see whether one format alleviates more of the conﬂicts you
see in Worksheets 16-4 and 16-5 than the other.
If you base your answer to this question purely on assumptions you’ve made about your
dream career, do yourself a big favor and start talking with others and researching the for-
mats that are possible. Chapters 14 and 15 can provide pointers on how to proceed with
this research.
Trying Your Career On for Size
As your picture of your dream career begins to fall into place, don’t act on it immediately.
Take a couple days to look at your idea from several different angles and do the following:
 When you wake up in the morning, run your career idea over in your mind.
 As you daydream about a workday in your dream career, compare and contrast what
you do now with what you think you may do in the future. Notice how you feel.
 Write in your journal about your career idea and its impact on your life.
 Look at the changes that may happen in your life as a result of making this change in
your career. By being aware of how your career change may ripple through your life,
you can make some proactive choices to minimize any surprises for yourself and your
family.
 Continue evolving your career idea as insights strike you. For instance, trying on your
business idea in your imagination may show you that a particular work schedule or
ofﬁce layout would be better for you than what you’d originally envisioned. (By staying
aware of your needs, you can continue to improve your work/life mix even after you start
your new venture.)
 Talk your idea over with someone you trust. Someone else’s questions may spark new
issues to consider or new ways to resolve your concerns.
As you imagine being in your new career, notice how you feel. Are you excited, motivated,
surprised, nervous, or scared? Let your feelings guide you to the best way to move forward.
Don’t be surprised if you’re a little nervous by the magnitude of your vision. It’s quite normal
to be a bit taken aback as you take your ﬁrst steps into a new life.
208
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

If you come face to face with an idea or a concern you hadn’t considered before, talk it over
with someone doing the work. It’s not too late to do an informational interview to conﬁrm
your own ideas or get pointers that can save you time and effort during your transition.
Better to have the information you need to make a solid decision than to change your life
based on a shaky, unbalanced foundation.
Spotting Potential Conflicts
Throughout this chapter, you see references to Worksheet 16-6, asking you to record any
conﬂicts you ﬁnd as you think about how your dream career blends with your needs.
Although focusing on potential conﬂicts may be a bit troubling at this stage of the game,
facing them now helps you ﬁnd a way around, through, or over potential deal breakers.
Use the following list of questions to shine light on conﬂicts that exist in your picture that
you haven’t voiced as of yet:
 Are your personal needs conﬂicting with your family’s needs?
 Does your career idea clash with your ﬁnancial needs?
 Does your career idea disregard your family’s needs?
 Does your career idea make it impossible to do the things you love to do in your per-
sonal time?
 Are your environmental needs not in alignment with your career idea?
 Does your career idea cause a geographic challenge?
 Does your career idea run counter to the current economic trends in your area?
 Does your career idea ignore a key part of your personal style?
If you have one or more conﬂicts to resolve, jump to Chapter 17 before you try to describe
your best scenario in the next section.

Describing Your Dream Career . . . to Date
In this section, you create one sentence to describe your dream career as you know it today.
Your statement probably will continue to evolve as your direction becomes clearer and
clearer.
Pinpoint your must-haves from Worksheets 16-1, 16-2, and 16-3 and jot them down in the top
portion of Worksheet 16-7. Then string your ideas together in various ways until you ﬁnd
the clearest way to describe what you truly want. You may ﬁnd it helpful to start your sen-
tence with the words “I want to . . . “
You don’t have to have a speciﬁc job title for your desired work to construct a sentence that
says it all. Be as speciﬁc as possible as you voice your desires. Take a look at the following
examples to get started:
 I want to use my accounting skills in a part-time position while working from home.
 I want to use my creativity to teach children how to read in a way that is fun.
 I want to combine my interests in numeric modeling, tornadoes, and aircraft design in
an internal consulting role.
After you have your sentence, write it in the lower portion of Worksheet 16-7. Then try it out
by saying the sentence to a couple of friends. Notice how they react. Do they get it? Use the
questions they raise to tighten or clarify your statement.
With this sentence in your head, you can punch the internal play button whenever anyone
asks what you’re doing these days or what you’re looking for. Imagine how helpful it is to be
able to clearly articulate your goal to your network of professional associates, your informa-
tional interview contacts, and prospective employers, customers, or schools. After a while,
you may ﬁnd yourself emphasizing different aspects of your sentence depending on whom
you’re talking with. Then you know you’ve fully integrated what you want. You’re on a roll!
As you move into implementing your goal in Chapters 18 and 19, your one-sentence-that-
says-it-all helps you assess whether opportunities are in alignment with your mission.
Having this rudder within you helps you steer clear of opportunities that take you off
focus and turns you toward opportunities that take you closer to your dream career.

If you’re torn between two different career directions, create a sentence for each one. As
you talk about your interests with contacts, you may ﬁnd more opportunities associated
with one of your ideas, you may discover that your skills are better suited to one option, or
you may ﬁnd a way to weave the two ideas together after all. Don’t be concerned that you
have two ideas at this point. Just proceed along both tracks at once.
If this process of coming up with a concise statement is difﬁcult and you identiﬁed some
conﬂicts in Worksheet 16-6, spend time with Chapter 17 to ﬁnd creative solutions to allevi-
ate the conﬂicts before you try to come up with your statement.
If you ﬁnd that writing this one sentence about your goal is difﬁcult but you aren’t over-
whelmed by any speciﬁc conﬂicts, proceed to Chapter 18 to identify your next step and
create a personalized action plan for yourself.

W
hile searching for your dream career, you may discover that a couple elements you
want in your work and need in your life appear to be diametrically opposed. In fact,
you may have made this discovery if you worked through Chapter 16.
At ﬁrst you may feel stumped. The ideas you’ve come up with initially don’t seem feasible or
practical. Although you may be tempted to give up at this point, keep in mind that you can
probably ﬁnd a host of creative solutions for any conﬂicts you see. You just need to know
how to ﬁnd them.
In this chapter, you discover a brainstorming process that gets you beyond the details of
your situation that aren’t working and helps you focus your attention on the aspects of your
situation that are deeply important to you.
To guide you through each step of this process, you ﬁnd the brainstorming that John, 
a scientist from New Mexico, did as he wrestled with a key issue in his life. Although John’s
situation may be different than yours, use his example to see how to approach your dilemma
in a new way.
Focusing on the Pieces That Appear to Clash
Before you begin trying to ﬁnd a creative way to resolve the clash between your life and
your dream career, think about how to describe the key issues of your situation as concisely
and clearly as you can.
In Figure 17-1, you can read how John describes his dilemma. Notice that he deﬁnes his situ-
ation as he sees it, laying out the cause that leads to an untenable effect for him.

In Worksheet 17-1, describe the clash you feel. Be as speciﬁc as you can be about what 
doesn’t work for you about your picture. Begin by making notes in the top portion of
the worksheet, and then, as your ideas crystallize, create a sentence or two that clearly
describes your dilemma.
If you face a couple dilemmas, make several copies of the worksheets in this chapter. Rather
than trying to work on all your dilemmas at once, I recommend focusing your attention on
one dilemma at a time. Who knows? Finding a solution to one of your dilemmas may open
up new opportunities to help address the other clashes.

John’s Dilemma
John’s Preliminary Notes:
 
I hate coming home all stressed out from driving.
 
The best jobs in my field are in a city one hour away —
longer in rush hour traffic.
 
Driving stresses me out.
 
I love working in my industry.
John’s Concise Statement of His Dilemma:
To work in the industry of my choice, my commute may be a stress-
filled, three-hour round trip, which means I’m going to arrive
home exhausted and unable to enjoy my kids.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Stepping Back to Focus on the Big Picture
To ﬁnd new solutions, you need to step away from the speciﬁcs of your picture and focus on
the overriding truth of what you want. Regardless of the particulars of your dilemma, how
do you want to feel when all is said and done? When you discover the essence of what you
want, you may well feel a sense of relief as you realize that you’ve been focusing so much on
the details that you’ve lost track of the big picture. Lifting your point of focus allows you to
see other ways to reach the outcome you desire.
After thinking about his clash, John discovered that the essence of his desires was best
stated as shown in Figure 17-2.
Although John doesn’t know exactly how it’s going to happen, recognizing and articulating
his bottom-line desire — feeling relaxed when he gets home from work — opens John’s
mind to new solutions.
As you look at your bigger picture, don’t worry about how to make it all happen; just stay
focused on the essence of what you want to bring about. As you read the description you
wrote about your clash in Worksheet 17-1, what is the essence that shines through? If you’d
like, you can use the top portion of Worksheet 17-2 to jot down some thoughts and then
write the ﬁnal statement of the essence you’d like in the lower portion.

Having a Brainstorming Blitz
After you have your target essence in mind (see the preceding section), you begin brain-
storming a slew of solutions. As in all brainstorming situations, all of your ideas are viable.
Take a look at John’s brainstormed list in Figure 17-3 before you start your own, using
Worksheet 17-3.
Boost your creative juices by eliminating any perceived or real constraints on your time,
money, and resources. Be outrageous! Elements of outrageous ideas often can become
useful when looking for creative solutions. If you’ve had fantasies about how to handle 
similar clashes in the past, by all means, include them in your list.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see a workable solution right off the bat. Although you
may be tempted to hope that your answer is sitting among those on your list, you’re more
likely to realize that your list contains pieces and ideas that you can use in the next section
to create a viable solution.
Spotting Creative Solutions
As you review your brainstormed list, notice the elements of your list that are intriguing,
give you hope, or give you a new view of your situation. As you get a feel for your list, look
for any pieces that you can combine to create the essence you want.
See Figure 17-4 for John’s list of possible solutions. At the bottom of the ﬁgure, notice that,
with the list at hand, John was able to develop a short-term plan and a long-term plan to
resolve his dilemma. Now, instead of focusing on what’s not working, he can dedicate his
energy to putting his solutions into place.
As you build your own list of possibilities in Worksheet 17-4, feel free to take a little of this
idea and a little of that idea to come up with your possible solutions.
Keep your focus on the solutions that give you the essence you’re searching for. If a solution
doesn’t feel quite right, identify what doesn’t work about it. Can you make a change to one
element to make the pieces ﬁt together better?
If you feel blocked, you’re probably still too close to the situation and having a hard time
letting go of particular methods and outcomes. Ask a few friends to help you explore your
ideas. They may see something that you don’t because they aren’t attached to the details in
the same way you are.
After you have a list of possible solutions, step away. Let your ideas sit for a couple of days.
Due to the thinking you have done thus far, you may, in the course of living your life, come
across a solution that goes a long way toward resolving your clash.
When you return to your list, you may discover a few more angles to think about. Add any
additional solutions you’ve identiﬁed into Worksheet 17-4.

Chapter 17: Reconciling Differences between Your Life and Your Dream Career

Now look at your list of possible solutions with an eye toward deciding which one or ones
look appealing to you. Look for the ones that are relatively easy to implement in the short
term and are likely to be effective. Keep in mind you may need to tweak things a few more
times to work out all the kinks in your situation. At the same time, look for any long-term
solutions that might be useful to work toward. Record both your short-term and your long-
term plans at the bottom of Worksheet 17-4.
If your clash seems insurmountable (no matter which way you look at your situation, you
keep coming up with the same unworkable answers), you may be asking yourself the same
series of questions again and again — a tactic that ultimately gets you nowhere. Instead,
look for a new question you can ask yourself. Search the Internet for an article about the
topic, listen to a radio interview on a related topic, or ask a friend a hypothetical question
that’s related to your dilemma. Take the new information you read or hear and use it as a
new ﬁlter through which to understand your situation. Perhaps you learn about a new term,
a new resource, or a new perspective. Any of these experiences can trigger you to ask your-
self a new set of questions about your quandary. With new questions come new answers
because they shift your perspective just enough that you see new avenues you never could
have seen from your old position. With the right questions, perceived clashes often evapo-
rate into thin air.
Reconciling True Differences
On occasion, you may discover clashes between two desired elements that you can’t readily
resolve. In these cases, you may be able to do little to get the pieces to fall into place exactly
as you would like, in the time frame you desire.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

To resolve the conﬂict, lift your view even higher to look at aspects of the decision you
haven’t thought to look at before.
As you check out the following strategies to see whether you can ﬁnd a solution that is at
least workable, begin to discern how you can minimize the negative impact the clash has
on you and your family while maximizing the aspects of it that are most important to you.
 Use a delay tactic: Postponing what you want until your circumstances change may
cause the clash to lose its punch. Perhaps you need to wait until your kids start school,
your kids get out of college, or you move.
 Revisit your values: Which option allows you to live closer to your values? Does this
clarity help you discern which element of your clash must take priority?
 Talk it over with your family: Consider any way the family can adjust to allow you to
meet your needs. Be honest and creative. Don’t get defensive. If the words, “Yes, but”
come out of your mouth, stop in your tracks to see what idea you’re not allowing in.
 Take vacation time: Maybe you can relegate one element of the clash to your vacation
or ﬁnd enough satisfaction expressing this part of yourself off the job. For example, if
you want to build a jewelry-making business but you can’t afford to do it full time, you
could devote one week’s vacation to a jewelry-making blitz each year. If you time it
right, you could have pieces to sell to friends for the holidays. Although it’s not a full-
ﬂedged business, it’s enough to keep you engaged in your passion and learning what
you need to learn to start a full-time business in the future.
 Turn the ideal into a hobby: Perhaps you can get what you want through a hobby
instead of making it part of your daily, full-time work.
As you think about your clash from these angles, notice whether you can combine any of
these ideas to create a workable solution. For example, you may focus your energy on a
hobby basis until your children leave for college in two years. If you play your cards right,
by the time you have the time to devote to pursuing your ideal career, you may have also
gained the experience you need to break into the ﬁeld or saved enough money to start the
business you’ve been dreaming of.
Dealing with What Can’t Be Reconciled
If you can’t yet see a way to reconcile the conﬂict you feel, take some time to write out your
dilemma and as many of the particulars as possible in Worksheet 17-5.
Time may change your life circumstances in ways you can’t predict today. Instead of turning
away from your idea entirely, keep your radar up and notice any shifts in your world that
allow for movement toward your dream. I realize this may sound rather far-fetched to you in
this moment, but over the years, I’ve seen people create their dream career within a couple
years of telling me it would never work.
In each case, something shifted, and they noticed a new possibility opening up. As you live
your life, pay attention to the following:
 Something changing within you, whether it’s your interests, values, priorities, or needs
 Circumstances changing for your spouse or within your family
 Something shifting within your community
 Something happening at an economic level
 Changes occurring in the realm of technology
219
Chapter 17: Reconciling Differences between Your Life and Your Dream Career

As long as you’re passionate about your idea, claim your passion and stop banging your
head against a closed door. Accept that you can’t take the step you’d like to at the moment
and be willing to wait for a while, until you experience a shift that reopens the door you now
see as closed.
Every three to six months, take a new look at Worksheets 17-1 through 17-5 to notice
whether anything’s changed in your vision of your dream career or your needs.
If you can pursue even one piece of your passion, put your energy there and trust that when
the time is right you’ll ﬁnd a way to move in the direction you desire. Sometimes taking a
couple steps down the path changes your view signiﬁcantly. At this point you can’t know how
things will unfold as you step forward. All you can do is take the steps that most closely align
with your vision of your dream career. Stay alert for new clues and be agile if opportunities
arise that point in new directions.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Chapter 18
Moving Ever Closer to 
Your Immediate Goal
In This Chapter
 Doing more research
 Finding ways to sample the work you want
 Exploring your options for more training and experience
 Preparing to get a new job or start your own business
 Creating your own action plan
S
uppose that you’ve reached the point where you have some idea of where you’re headed
with your next career. (If you’ve been doing the worksheets in the earlier chapters in
this book, you’re probably clearer about possible directions than if you haven’t done the
previous chapters.) Depending on your situation, your career idea may be a bit sketchy,
crystal clear, or somewhere in between. This chapter helps you chart your next steps
regardless of whether you’re narrowing your options, searching for opportunities to test
your idea, looking for ways to increase your training and experience, or preparing to launch
your job search or business.
Begin by reading through each path described in the chapter to identify where you are in
the process and where you ultimately want to be. Use the appropriate section to guide you
in deﬁning and mastering your immediate goal. Achieving a certain degree of comfort in
your current path is essential before you move on to the next path.
If you aren’t sure about or comfortable with the results you’re getting in your current path,
don’t leap ahead to the next path, thinking that action will ﬁx things. For example, rushing
to test-drive a career when you haven’t done the research to be sure that the career ﬁts
your life is the equivalent of spinning your wheels. You make the best impression and get
the best results when you step into a test-drive, job search, or school setting with conﬁ-
dence that you’re comfortable with your target goal. No matter what your intentions are,
rushing forward to the next path isn’t going to resolve your discomfort. Instead use the 
recommendations included in each path to take the steps necessary to feel comfortable
moving on to the next path.
After you have your next steps mapped out and in progress, use Chapter 19 to create your
overall plan to go back to school, get a job, or start your own business.

Path One: Expanding Your Research
Your main objective at this point is to conﬁrm that your target career is a good ﬁt for you.
If you feel uncertain about your proposed direction, if some part of your picture has you
worried, or if you’re intrigued by a different career that caught your eye during your research,
continue your exploration.
There’s no way to rush this veriﬁcation process, so please don’t attempt to. If you must get
out of the job you’re in, think about ﬁnding an interim job that takes you out of the bad 
situation but doesn’t lull you into thinking it’s the end of your journey. After you get settled
in your new job, reactivate your exploration to clarify your ultimate career picture.
No matter what your reason for continuing your exploration, your next step is to revisit
Chapters 14 and 15 to deepen your understanding of your target career. Then use the infor-
mation you ﬁnd to reﬁne your picture in Chapter 16.
If your research on your top two careers isn’t working out the way you thought it might,
revisit your top ten career ideas to see whether anything new pops forward. If it does,
switch gears to explore your new idea. If a new idea isn’t immediately obvious, use the fol-
lowing list to trace your path back to where things became unclear.
 Because nothing in your Top Ten list is ringing your chimes, take another step back 
to look at your lists of passions and interests in Worksheets 7-7 (Chapter 7) and 8-5
(Chapter 8). Reacquaint yourself with your lists and update them as needed. Conﬁrm
that every item on the list aligns with your true interests. Remember that each item is 
a building block for your new career, so it must be solid for your career to withstand
the test of time. If you signiﬁcantly rebuild your lists of favorite passions and interests,
you may want to do a few more brainstorming rounds in Chapter 10 to see what new
career ideas surface.
 If you second guess the items you put on your lists of passions and interests, take
some time to review the activities in Chapters 7 and 8 to rebuild your list. If, in the
process, you realize that you aren’t sure what you truly enjoy, revisit Chapter 2 for
some ideas on how to connect with your interests.
 If you ﬁnd yourself ﬂitting from one possible career to another, wondering at each turn
whether “this” is the one, stop and take a deep breath. Find a quiet place and review
the last worksheet in each chapter to reconnect with your personal style, your lifestyle
needs, your work environment preferences, and your passions and interests. Reading
the lists in the same sitting allows you to integrate your ideal picture. With this infor-
mation fresh in your mind, review your top ten career ideas to refocus your attention
on the careers that are the best ﬁt for you.
 If you came up with your career idea without working through any of the worksheets 
in this book and you’re ﬁnding that the idea isn’t quite working out, take the time to
work through the chapters in order, so you can build your dream career layer by layer.
By having a clear picture of your needs and desires, you have a much better chance of
ﬁnding your dream career.
You don’t have to be 100 percent sure about your career idea before you move to Path Two
to test it out. In fact, you can’t possibly know the status of this career in absolute terms. What
you do need to know is that you’re attracted to the career, there are no immediate red ﬂags,
and you’re interested in knowing more about it. Keep in mind that some of your answers
can’t unfold until you move forward and test the waters.
222
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Path Two: Taking a Test-Drive
If you have a pretty good idea what you want to do next but wish you knew for sure, your
best next step is to ﬁnd a way to test-drive your career.
Most people wouldn’t think of buying a car without taking it for a spin ﬁrst, so why should 
it be different with a career? Although trying out the exact job you’re thinking about may 
be impossible, with some ingenuity, you can ﬁnd an opportunity that’s a close facsimile. 
The key is to ﬁnd a way to use the skills, perform the tasks, and interact with people as you
would in the real job. Check out Chapter 20 for some ideas about how to test-drive your
career ideas.
Even if your test-drive gives you a part-time venue, in a smaller company or a different 
environment, with a minimal salary, you can still gain a number of insights from the 
opportunity.
 You get to experience how you feel while doing the work. It’s one thing to think about
and talk about a profession but quite another to take a sample bite!
 You can discern whether it’s worth investing the time, energy, and resources required
to get the training and experience you need to enter the ﬁeld full time.
 You begin building your network.
 You get some face-to-face time with your cohorts in the profession. Pay attention to
your interactions and how comfortable you feel. One key clue is whether you get their
sense of humor or are turned off by it.
Due to the limits inherent in a test-drive, you may not feel as if a test-drive gives you a 
complete picture of the profession. However, if you evaluate your experience, keeping the
limited scope of your test-drive in mind, you’ll probably be able to come to several conclu-
sions, including whether you feel good doing the work or whether you feel uncomfortable,
frustrated, or bored in the ﬁeld. If the jury is still out, you may need a second test-drive 
with clearer parameters or a better understanding of the role you’d play if you took this 
job for real.
In each case, you want to combine what you know from your research with what you gain
from your test-drive experience to decide how to proceed. If you’re intrigued with the
career, move on to Path Three. If you aren’t sure whether the career is right for you, try
another test-drive or swing back to Path One to ﬁnd a more suitable niche.
Path Three: Assessing Your 
Need for More Training
After you’re comfortable with your career goal, it’s time to look for ways to gain the knowledge
and skills you need to succeed in your new career. Review the career proﬁles and informational
interview notes you collected in the course of your research. (See Chapters 14 and 15 for
tips on gathering this information.) Pay particular attention to the education requirements
and the discussion of any traits and skills you need to succeed in your target career. If you
have any questions about what’s required, check with your contacts.
223
Chapter 18: Moving Ever Closer to Your Immediate Goal

After you know what skills are essential, compare your education and the experience you
already have with what’s needed. Identify any hot spots you must target. Use the following
questions to focus your thoughts:
 Do you need to update your knowledge in a certain area?
 Is there a particular skill you must add to your repertoire?
 Do you need to work toward a certiﬁcate or license?
 Do you need to get a speciﬁc degree?
 Do you have any options in the amount of training you need, or does one standard hold
for everyone in the ﬁeld?
 Does making a slight change to your career goal impact the education requirements in
any way?
If the thought of going to school makes your skin crawl or your stomach sink, don’t give up
just yet! Depending on your situation, a class or two may put you in a great position to move
forward. If you do need more education or training, keep in mind that a number of new 
educational formats, such as online training or training by teleclasses (classes by phone),
expand your options far beyond the traditional classroom setting.
Before you decide the best way to get the training you need, take some time to assess your
own learning style in Worksheet 18-1. Use the questions and prompts in the worksheet to
guide you in thinking about your learning style. Record your thoughts in the right-hand
column. Knowing how you learn allows you to make better decisions when it comes to 
evaluating your various education options.
Even if taking on the challenge of additional training seems impossible right now, keep an
open mind until you have more information about your options. Who knows? You may dis-
cover something that works surprisingly well.
After you complete Worksheet 18-1, take some time to record any conclusions you come up
with in Worksheet 18-2. As you think about your best learning format, blend what you know
about your personal learning style with what you know about your lifestyle realities.
To make your training as productive and successful as possible, choose the educational
options that feel good to you. For example,
 If writing isn’t your forte, don’t take on a master’s program with a thesis requirement.
 If you don’t learn well on your own, don’t talk yourself into believing that a self-paced
course is going to be different.
 If you hate pure silence, don’t think that you can suddenly force yourself to go to the
library on a regular basis to study.
Learning is hard enough without adding the extra burden of force to the equation. Think about
your natural tendencies and leverage off those, so you can put your energy into learning
and studying rather than ﬁghting the learning format.
If part of your path includes a formal degree, look at Chapter 19 to discover how to locate
the best program to meet your needs and how to submit your application.

Path Four: Gaining Work Experience
After you have the knowledge you need, you’re ready to gain some experience in your ﬁeld.
Although you may be able to use an entry-level job in your new ﬁeld to obtain your real-life
experience, you may need to be a bit more creative.
Most companies are interested in hiring those who already have experience. Although this
position makes perfect sense from their point of view — low training investment and a high
return on what they do invest — it’s one of the most frustrating aspects of changing careers.
How can you get experience in the new ﬁeld if companies hire only people with experience?
Your ingenuity and determination come into play here. Start looking for ways to gain expe-
rience. At ﬁrst, you may need to work on a side project or in a volunteer position. Take
whatever targeted opportunities come your way. Choose experiences that build your 
case so that eventually you can apply to your desired job with ample evidence of your 
experience. Read Chapters 20 and 21 for ideas to get you started as you consider the 
stepping-stone experiences that will take you where you want to go.
Even if you plan to start your own business, increase your chances of success by getting
some experience in the ﬁeld or at least in a small entrepreneurial company ﬁrst. Although
you’re no doubt anxious to get started, you save time, money, and angst in the long run by
learning the ropes the easy way — with someone else’s money at stake.
If you enter into a working relationship with someone who may ultimately be a competitor,
pay close attention to the agreement you sign. You don’t want to sign a non-compete clause
and limit your ability to start your own business where you choose.
Path Five: Preparing Your Job Search
If you have enough related experience from your past jobs, you may be in a good position to
begin preparing for your job search. Please note that starting to prepare is not the same as
announcing your intentions to everyone you know. Take some time to get several key pieces
in place before you raise the ﬂag to signal that you’re off to search for your new job.

Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Reworking your resume
Of course, just about anyone you talk to about your new career direction is likely to ask for
a copy of your resume. Instead of stumbling your way through these conversations, take the
time to rework your resume before someone asks for it.
If you’re entertaining two similar, but different, career directions, you’re embarking on two
simultaneous job searches. Create a distinct resume for each one by listing your experi-
ences in a way that highlights the skills that are particularly relevant for each career.
To be effective, your resume must catch people’s attention and hold it long enough for them
to see that you’re a viable candidate for the job. To increase the readability of your resume,
make sure that the following crucial information is easy to spot:
 If you state your objective at the top of your resume, use the title of the job you’re apply-
ing for in the statement so that your resume is categorized correctly by those reading it.
Avoid meaningless, showy phrases about how you want to contribute to the company.
 Use a format that gives the reader a good sense of what you did in each job you’ve
held. Use paragraphs to describe your responsibilities and then list three or four 
bullets to illustrate your accomplishments in each job.
 Make your accomplishments more convincing by weaving quantiﬁable results, such as
creating a 50 percent increase in annual sales, managing a million-dollar project budget,
producing a 30 percent cost savings, or managing a team of 20 volunteers, into your
resume.
 If you’re changing careers, translate what you accomplished in your old career into the
terminology of the new industry. You want the reader to get the gist of your experience
without stumbling over unfamiliar terms.
 In the past, experts recommended limiting your resume to one page. Now, with career
changes and shorter job tenures, you may need more than one page to show all your
relevant experience. However, your resume should be as concise and easy to scan as
possible.
 If you gained experience in your new area through volunteer work, part-time work, or
project work in your job, incorporate the information straight into your resume. If the
information doesn’t ﬁt into your resume, include a paragraph or two in your cover
letter to highlight your experience.
 Use a carefully crafted cover letter to justify why you are the person for the job.
Producing a polished resume printed on high-quality paper used to be the job applicant’s
goal, but times have changed. In today’s world, you must have a high-quality resume that
can be e-mailed, faxed, scanned, posted on the Internet, and handed out in person. Before
you start your job search in earnest, test these various delivery methods to verify that your
resume comes across as intended.
For additional tips on writing an effective resume, consult Resumes For Dummies, by Joyce
Lain Kennedy (Wiley).

By this point in your career exploration, you probably have developed an extended network
of contacts. (If not, see Chapter 15 for more information on building your list of contacts.)
Your list may consist of friends, colleagues, informational interview contacts, and people
you have met through professional associations. Although you may have talked to some of
them fairly recently, reconnect with them to let them know exactly what kind of employment
situation you’re looking for.
227
Chapter 18: Moving Ever Closer to Your Immediate Goal

Be explicit in your request. Ask your contacts to forward your resume if they know of any
openings that ﬁt your description or of anybody who may know of openings in your ﬁeld.
The more clearly you can describe your ideal job, the better your contacts can assist you.
When you call your contacts, have a carefully thought-out description of what you’re look-
ing for. After your conversation, be prepared to forward your description as part of your
cover letter, whether in bullet or paragraph form, to them, along with your resume.
If you don’t already have a recruiter or two in your network, ask around to see whether your
friends can put you in touch with one. Recruiters are connected; networking is their business!
If they don’t place people in your area of expertise, they can refer you to someone who does.
Recruiters work in several ways under several different titles, including the following:
 Headhunters: They place qualiﬁed full-time applicants in a range of companies. They
often serve a particular industry or profession.
 Recruiters: They work within an agency to ﬁnd temporary or contract employees for a
variety of client companies.
 Staff or on-site recruiters: They search for applicants to ﬁll the stafﬁng needs for one
speciﬁc company.
Recruiters ﬁnd qualiﬁed people to ﬁll job openings. They talk with people constantly and
are extremely busy professionals. Don’t ask them to help you ﬁgure out what your next
career should be. Don’t expect them to be a walking job board either. Inform them of what
you want and then continue your search on your own.
Searching for job openings
In addition to tapping your network for openings, do your own footwork to ﬁnd potential
jobs. Start by brainstorming the places that are likely to post jobs in your ﬁeld. Consider the
following ideas:
 Check out the jobs listed by your professional association.
 Visit your local career center to review its lists of openings. Depending on your loca-
tion, you may be able to ﬁnd a career center on a local college campus, through a
governmental agency, or in a privately run business.
 Check to see whether your alumni organization has any career support services.
 Attend any relevant job fairs in your geographic area.
 Surf Web sites related to your industry or profession for sites that provide job listings.
 Scan the want ads in your Sunday paper.
 Target key companies in your area by visiting their Web sites or their on-site job boards.
Consider posting your resume on a Web-based job board so that recruiters and hiring person-
nel can ﬁnd you. Here are some tips on sites to check out if you want to pursue this option:
 At the Monster (www.monster.com) and Yahoo! HotJobs (http://hotjobs.yahoo.
com) Web sites, you can search jobs in a wide variety of locations and industries.
 Job-Hunt (www.job-hunt.org) and the Riley Guide (http://rileyguide.com/jobs.
html) provide lists of job search sites for various professions, industries, and regions.
 Visit your professional or industry association’s job boards.
228
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Companies pay a fee to gain access to many of these job boards, so don’t refer a recruiter or
contact to your posted resume unless you have veriﬁed that they have access to that partic-
ular board.
If you put all your eggs in one basket to ﬁnd your job through an online job board, you may
be disappointed in the end. There are estimates that only 10 percent of jobs are ﬁlled from
online job boards. As in the dark ages before the Internet, it still pays to network, network,
network!
If you’re currently employed, your employer may use these same job boards to ﬁnd quali-
ﬁed applicants. Think about the ramiﬁcations of your employer ﬁnding your resume posted
on one of these sites. To avoid this potential problem, you have two options:
 Some job boards provide a conﬁdential resume option in which your name and your
current company are hidden from view. Interested recruiters can send you a blind
e-mail, and then you can decide whether to release your identity to them.
 You can post your resume, along with articles or examples from your portfolio, 
on your personal Web page. Then, when you e-mail potential employers, you can
include your Web address in your e-mails. If you send recruiters to your site, think
through the personal information you reveal on your Web site. If you decide to keep
this site alive after you get a job, you can give the Web address to people who want to
know more about you.
Use Worksheet 18-3 to plan for your steps during your job search. Use the right-hand column
to make notes about your speciﬁc situation. As soon as you have a live job opening in sight,

Path Six: Refining Your Business Idea
If you’ve determined that you want to start a business, you have many steps to take before
you throw open your doors or launch your Web site. One of the ﬁrst steps is to start getting
clear about the product or service you plan to offer.
Although you’re likely to evolve your ideas as you do more research and talk to your pro-
spective clients, make a stab at describing your current business ideas on paper.
Many new businesses mistakenly think that if they offer anything and everything to every-
body, they’re more likely to be successful. Fortunately, just the opposite is often true. If your
offerings are so broad that no one can clearly describe what you do, people don’t become
customers, and more importantly, they can’t refer other people to you.
You need to focus your business so that it provides a particular product or service to a
deﬁnable target population. Then those who hear about your business know exactly what
you do and can send qualiﬁed leads your way. For more information about establishing a
viable niche, read Nichecraft: Using Your Specialness to Focus Your Business, Corner Your
Market and Make Customers Seek You Out, by Lynda Falkenstein (Niche Press) or visit her
Web site at www.falkenstein.com.
Describe your product or service as clearly and concisely as possible in Worksheet 18-4. 
Be sure to list the key features your product or service provides as well as the beneﬁts your
customers receive. While you’re thinking about it, list the characteristics of your target cus-
tomer as well. All of this information becomes the cornerstone of your marketing as you
move forward with your business idea. As you write the description of your products or
services, don’t be surprised if you notice gaps in your logic or ﬁnd that you have a difﬁcult
time putting it all down on paper. Although neither of these outcomes is likely to dash your
hopes of being a successful entrepreneur, you must take the time you need to sort it all out
long before you open your doors or launch your site.
As soon as you can articulate your offerings clearly in as few words as possible, you’re
ready for your next steps.
 Talk to potential customers about the products or services you have in mind. You
need to see how they respond. Listen to their questions and comments with both ears.
Don’t defend your idea. If they don’t get it, your clients won’t either, so take what you
hear to heart and revamp your product or service accordingly. Then try again. After a
few rounds of testing, you may ﬁnd that people are anxious to get their hands on your
product or service. After you have their attention, ask them how much they would pay
for a product or service such as yours.
 Check out your competition. As you clarify your products and services, keep an eye
out for others who offer something similar. When you visit their locations, read their
advertisements, scan their Web sites, and review their telephone book listings, notice
the key features of their offerings, how they price them, and what audience they target.
Use this valuable information to help you reﬁne your niche and decide how to run your
business.
If you have a hot new twist on a product or service that no one else has thought of, keep
it close to your chest for a while until you’re ready to launch your business. Do your
research and talk with a lawyer to determine whether a trademark or patent is in order
to protect your idea.
230
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

 Scout your location options. To run a successful business, you must choose a location
that ﬁts your needs. How are customers likely to interact with your business? Are they
likely to contact you in person, by phone, through other companies, or over the Internet?
Do you need a retail location, manufacturing space, ofﬁce space, or an online presence?
How do you intend to handle shipping and receiving? Do you need storage for supplies
or inventory, a waiting room, or any special equipment?
If you want to work from home, check with your city to determine how it regulates
home businesses.
 Think through your ﬁnancing options. One of the most important decisions you make
in the early stages of your business is how you’re going to ﬁnance your start-up costs
and living expenses while you’re building your business. You may decide to ﬁnance 
the venture yourself, look to friends and family members to invest in your business, 
or apply for a loan. To present a credible explanation of your business to possible
investors (including yourself), spend time developing a well-thought-out business 
plan. Refer to Business Plans For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Paul Tiffany and Steven D.
Peterson (Wiley) for the how-to details. Another option, if you aren’t in a position to
move your business into full gear from the start, is to ease into your business. Turn to
Chapter 21 for creative ways to transition into your new business.
Use Worksheet 18-5 to track the steps you take in beginning to plan your business. Look to
Chapter 19 for additional steps you can take to launch your business.

Preparing Your Personalized Action Plan
What’s your next step? And the one after that? By creating a clear picture of your next few
steps, you focus your energy on moving forward instead of spinning in circles wondering
what to do next.
Use Worksheet 18-6 to lay out your plan. Put an X next to anything you feel you’ve com-
pleted. Place a 1 adjacent to your next step and a 2 to indicate the next step after that.
Always keep your focus on your current step with an eye on what’s next in the pipeline.
After you have a sense of how to focus your attention, use Worksheets 18-7 and 18-8 to spec-
ify your actions for your 1 and 2 priority paths. Be as speciﬁc as you can and track your
progress as you go.
As you complete the tasks associated with your ﬁrst priority path, take stock to verify that
your second goal is still relevant. As that path becomes your top priority, take some time 
to look into the future to start sketching out your next priority. By keeping an eye to your
future goal, you minimize the risk of ﬁnishing a task and not knowing where to go next.
If you’re ready to begin searching for the right school, your job search is in full swing, or
your business idea is ready to go, proceed to Chapter 19 to develop your longer-term plan.

Chapter 19
Turning Your Dream Career 
into a Reality
In This Chapter
 Setting up your path to your education
 Landing your dream job
 Getting your business underway
 Deciding the best way to transition into your future
I
f you’ve identiﬁed your new career, tested it out, and taken some preliminary steps, now
you’re ready to get the show on the road.
To bring your dream goal to life, you must focus your attention, energy, and resources on
the steps required to achieve success.
If you have any lingering questions or doubts about your goal, swing back through Chapter 18
to identify what’s not falling into place. Reﬁning your goals so that you can stand behind it
100 percent is a crucial precursor to your success. Any doubts and questions act like a braking
system, keeping you from devoting all you have to your cause. Ever tried to reach a destination
with one foot on the gas pedal and one on the brake? Didn’t get very far, did you?
This chapter gives you pointers on how to reach your ultimate goal, whether you’re apply-
ing to your dream school, going for your dream job, or launching your dream business.
The last part of this chapter helps you choreograph your transition from where you are now
to where you want to be. In most cases, it’s not as easy as ﬂipping a switch and being in the
middle of your new life. How your transition unfolds depends on a number of factors and
can be, to some extent, orchestrated to ﬁt your needs professionally and personally.
Having a clear, committed focus doesn’t mean that you have complete clarity about how
each step of your journey will unfold. That kind of omniscience isn’t possible. The key is
having a strong enough commitment to your goal that you’re willing to hang in there when
the path isn’t clear, to ﬁnd creative solutions when stumbling blocks appear, and to follow
through on your plan until you reach your goal.
Goal One: Heading Back to School
If taking a class here and doing a project there doesn’t give you the training you need to
enter your new profession, you may need to get a degree or work toward licensure.

Going to school requires a commitment of your time, money, and attention for an extended
period. I don’t recommend making this decision lightly. Devote the time it takes to research
and think through your decision before you take action.
If you haven’t been in school in a while, take one course as a test run before you apply to a
full degree program. Although this goal isn’t insurmountable, knowing how much attending
classes, doing your homework, preparing for tests, and doing projects impacts your life and
your family gives you an opportunity to make some adjustments before your school work-
load tests your limits.
Enrolling in school because you don’t know what else to do or because someone told you
the degree is the ticket to more money is a bad idea. Go to school if and only if the degree
enables you to do the work that you want to do.
You may ﬁnd yourself shying away from your goals because you think that you’re too old
to go to school. News ﬂash! You will be that much older in several years whether you go to
school or not! Wouldn’t it be better to have options and feel fulﬁlled rather than be stuck in
a dead-end career going nowhere? People of all ages return to school to fulﬁll their dreams.
Don’t let your age become your excuse for passing up your dream of a satisfying career.
Locating potential programs
A vast number of educational programs exist these days. To narrow your initial quest for
appropriate programs, answer the following questions:
 To achieve your career goal, what level of education do you require? An undergradu-
ate degree? A certiﬁcate? A graduate degree?
 What geographic area are you willing to consider? In addition to the schools in your
area, include schools that have extension programs and distance-learning options.
Think carefully about your willingness to relocate in case the right program is located
out of your area.
 How much can you spend on your education? Don’t limit yourself before you do a pre-
liminary exploration of your ﬁnancial options. In doing a search, you may ﬁnd solutions
you didn’t know were available to you. For instance, did you know ﬁnancial aid is avail-
able to nontraditional full-time students at accredited schools? To understand how to
apply for scholarships or grants, visit the Free Scholarship Search Web site at www.
freschinfo.com/strategy-nontrad.phtml. In addition to valuable how-to informa-
tion, this site has a database of information about 169,000 scholarships provided by
over 2,000 organizations. If you’d rather look at a book, enter the term “scholarships”
into any online bookstore search engine to ﬁnd the latest scholarship compendiums.
You can uncover other creative ﬁnancing solutions by checking with your current
employer about educational reimbursement programs or scholarships, talking with
your accountant about tax credits for educational expenses, or investigating a home
equity loan. Knowledge about your ﬁnancial options gives you power and hope.
Each school you look at may have a slightly different name for the program you’re inter-
ested in. Don’t limit your search; explore several content areas and departments to make
sure that you ﬁnd all the relevant programs. The following advice may help you ﬁnd the
right program:
 Talk with your contacts to discover where they were trained and which programs they
recommend.
 Visit the Web sites for the schools in your area and search their online course catalogs
and offerings.
236
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

 Visit www.collegiate.net/infob.html on the Web, a collegiate information site, 
to ﬁnd links to numerous colleges, universities, community colleges, and speciﬁc
departments.
 Check your local bookstore or library for books describing schools with programs in
your ﬁeld.
 Investigate distance-learning options including Phoenix University (www.phoenix.
edu/general/index.html) and the United States Open University (www.open-
university-online.com), which are designed speciﬁcally for working adults pursu-
ing degrees. Distance learning refers to any learning situation in which the instructor
and student are not in the same place at the same time. Course work can be delivered
through the mail, video, cable television, interactive television, satellite broadcasts,
e-mails, message boards, Web sites, chat rooms, computer conferencing, telephone, or
some combination of these methods. Distance learning can be used to take an individ-
ual class or to earn a degree. You can learn more about distance learning and check 
out the accreditation status of possible schools at the Distance Education and Training
Council Web site at www.detc.org. Distance Learning Online For Dummies, by Nancy
Stevenson (Wiley), is also a valuable resource.
 If you don’t ﬁnd just the program you want, consider applying to a school that allows
you to design a degree program that ﬁts your interests and needs. Check the school’s
Web site for links entitled individualized learning, self-designed programs, interdiscipli-
nary studies, and joint degree programs. Although this option isn’t available at every
school, if you ﬁnd the idea intriguing, it never hurts to ask.
When you ﬁnd a program that interests you, print out the relevant pages and request an
informational packet from the school.
Choosing the right program for you
Depending on the number of schools you consider, selecting the best program may be a bit
overwhelming at ﬁrst. Between the amount of information you receive and the number of
possibilities you are trying on, your mind may spin in all sorts of directions trying to ﬁgure
out a workable plan of action. Take it one step at a time. Use the following step-by-step
process to keep focused and moving forward:
1. Get an overview of each program.
When you have a collection of possible programs in hand, read over the material in
detail to get a sense of each program. Pay attention to the program description while
taking note of any special features that are particularly relevant to your target career.
Keep track of the faculty research interests. This information is important because
most faculty members prefer to guide students who have interests similar to their own,
so if you expect to do research as part of your degree program, make sure that their
research is relevant to your goals. Double-check that the program prepares you for any
additional licenses or certiﬁcations you may need.
2. Compare and contrast the various programs.
Each school is likely to use a slightly different format to describe its program, so you
may want to make a chart for each program to keep the details straight. Determine
what you want to know about each program and then ﬁll in the details. Don’t be sur-
prised if your chart has some blanks. You can ﬁll in these answers in Step 4.
3. Get a sense of which programs interest you most.
Tune in to your intuition as you study each program. Which programs feel the best
to you? Your sense of excitement, or lack thereof, is a clue worth paying attention to.
Make note of what about your top picks appeals to you.
237
Chapter 19: Turning Your Dream Career into a Reality

4. Check out the interesting programs.
If you’re considering a traditional school, visit the school in person if at all possible.
Call ahead to make an appointment to meet with a professor or an admissions coun-
selor. Ask to talk with some current students. See whether you can sit in on a class
in progress. Be sure to prepare questions ahead of time based on the blanks in your
detail sheet. This is a good time to ask about prerequisites and any anticipated faculty
changes.
If you are considering a distance learning format and haven’t taken an online course
before, take a single course through the school to see what it’s like before you commit
to an entire program.
5. Apply to your top choices.
Be sure to leave yourself enough time to complete each application with thought and
care. For any required recommendations, choose people who have some clout in your
target ﬁeld or a related ﬁeld. The people you ask should also know you well enough 
to have knowledge of your talents and abilities, a sense of your ability to complete an
education program, and the conﬁdence to afﬁrm your character. Create a packet for
each reference that includes a description of what each school wants, including any
forms they must ﬁll out, a copy of your professional resume, a list of courses you’ve
taken with them, a list of projects you worked on with them, a list of extracurricular
activities that you’ve participated in (such as professional association memberships,
volunteer activities, related course work, and leadership roles), and an explanation of
why you’re applying to the program. Be sure to thank your references and keep them
posted of your progress.
Becoming a student at this point in your life is bound to be a transition. Ease into the lifestyle
and increase your chances of success by taking only one or two courses your ﬁrst term,
especially if you plan to work full time while you’re in school.
Making time for school
Because your time is at a premium while you’re in school, you may need to rearrange some
parts of your life in order to make the most of your schooling. Think about the following as
you prepare to start your studies:
 Adjusting your priorities: With school entering the picture, your life may change form.
Make a list of your three top priorities. By being clear about your new priorities, you
can make decisions in alignment with your current reality.
 Giving friends, family members, and co-workers a heads-up: Tell the people in your
life that you may not be as available as you have been and why. If you take care of this
in an upfront manner, you’re less likely to offend people who don’t understand why
you’ve pulled back or disappeared. Be sure to warn people when midterms and ﬁnals
roll around.
 Setting aside time to study: Create a system to stay on top of your schoolwork. Keep up
with reading assignments and begin thinking about projects as soon as they’re assigned.
You’re investing too much time, money, and effort to shortchange your learning by
cramming before tests and rushing to ﬁnish projects.
 Finding new ways to get things done at home and at work: Simplify wherever possi-
ble. For example, if doing your hair takes you a half-hour each morning, get it cut in a
way that takes you only ﬁve minutes. Eliminate tasks or delegate what you can by ﬁnd-
ing someone else who can accomplish the task.
238
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

You’re not alone. You’re part of the fastest growing segment of the student population 
in most colleges. To ﬁnd out how others are doing it, check out the Association for Non-
Traditional Students in Higher Education (www.antshe.org). Your time in school won’t 
last forever. While you’re there, focus as much as you can on enjoying the process.
Goal Two: Going for Your Dream Job
After you track down a qualiﬁed job lead, you must be ready to act. Following the guidelines
in this section gets you off on the right foot.
Preparing a stellar application packet
To have the opportunity to interview for the jobs that interest you, you must have a well
conceived set of documents that accurately describe your skills, experience, and interest in
the position and attract the attention of the hiring manager. Take the time to create a thor-
ough packet that you can customize for each lead you want to follow up on.
Your ﬁrst task is to rework your resume, which I discuss in Chapter 18. Next, write a cover
letter to demonstrate that you can do the job. Use phrases from the want ad or online listing
to strengthen your letter. If you can’t get your hands on a written description of the job, talk
with your contacts who have a working knowledge of the kind of job you’re applying for to
make sure that your cover letter is on the mark. For more info, check out Cover Letters For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Joyce Lain Kennedy (Wiley).
Pay close attention to all the details in the packets you send out, whether they go by mail,
e-mail, or fax. Remember to proofread everything, verify that your own contact information
is accurate and easy to locate, sign your cover letter, and check the overall presentation one
last time. If possible, ask a friend or family member to look over each packet before you send
it out. A second pair of eyes never hurts.
If appropriate for your profession, prepare a portfolio with samples of your work, such as
newsletters you’ve produced, articles you’ve written, photographs you’ve taken, or logos
you’ve designed. Talk with your informational interview contacts to determine whether it’s
appropriate in your dream career to prepare a portfolio to take to your interviews.
Making the most of your interview
Any interview is a two-way street. Just as your interviewer asks you pointed questions 
to verify that you’re a good ﬁt for the company’s culture and the position, you must ask
questions to determine whether the company suits you. After you get the call to set up an
interview, do the following two kinds of research and create a list of questions to ask during
your interview:
 Review what you know you need in a job. Pay particular attention to work environ-
ment issues and your personal lifestyle preferences. Develop questions you can ask to
verify that the job can blend well with your life.
 Increase your understanding of the company and the industry. Check out the com-
pany’s Web site and read about their products, technology, key players, and history.
Check the local press for information about the company and the company’s com-
petition. Visit Quintessential Careers (www.quintcareers.com/researching_
companies.html) for a variety of links for researching companies and industries.
239
Chapter 19: Turning Your Dream Career into a Reality

When you can, conduct your research several days before the interview to give yourself a
chance to think about what you read. Then the night before your interview, review the infor-
mation again so that it’s fresh in your mind.
The following list includes additional tips to help you prepare for your interview:
 Be prepared to talk with the recruiter or the in-house interviewer about any speciﬁc
expectations you have regarding your salary range, beneﬁts, vacation time, and stock
options. Be upfront about your needs and listen to the interviewer’s comments about
the likelihood of fulﬁlling them. Although you may not get everything you want, you’re
more likely to create a job that ﬁts your needs if you speak up at this early stage.
 Your ﬁrst interview may last about an hour, but be prepared to interview with a series
of people. If you have time constraints, make that clear when you arrange the interview.
Most companies are considerate about time limitations, but sometimes interviews start
later or run longer than anticipated. Take this into account when scheduling your time.
As you ﬁnish your interview, inquire about the next step. The interviewer’s answer gives
you some idea of when you may hear word.
 Know your resume inside and out because your resume is your interviewer’s starting
point. Be prepared to talk about speciﬁc jobs and particular projects in detail. In your
interview, you may be asked questions that require you to explain and defend your
experience and how it relates to the job that you’re interested in. This is especially
true if you’re changing careers.
If certain aspects of your resume make you feel uncomfortable, don’t expect to hide
them from your interviewer. Find a way to make peace with them. The more conﬁdent
you feel about your explanations, the less time your interviewer may spend digging
into the issue.
Come up with plausible explanations for the gaps and bumps in your employment his-
tory before the interview. Ask yourself the following questions to help you prepare:
• Were you in school, parenting, caretaking, recovering from an illness, or traveling?
• Were you laid off, ﬁred, downsized, or right-sized?
• Did you quit? If so, why?
 Give enough detail about your career history to adequately answer any questions, but
don’t ever speak about your former employer or manager in a petty, blaming, or vin-
dictive manner. If there was a problem, have a solution or an idea to share with your
interviewer to show that you have a proactive attitude about the situation.
 Fidgeting, breaking eye contact, or taking on an apologetic tone of voice while respond-
ing to these questions tips your hand. Recruit a friend to help you role-play your answers
to a few key questions. Practice until your response rolls off your tongue without 
hesitation.
Interviewing is like dating. Both parties purposely portray themselves in the best possible
light. Look and listen for clues to uncover the whole story. Does what the interviewer says
match what you read in the newspaper yesterday or saw on the newsgroup discussion last
night?
As you review your interviews, notice any gaps or inconsistencies in what you saw, heard,
and sensed in each job. Don’t side-step your intuition for any reason. If something doesn’t
add up, dig deeper to uncover the real story. Although no job is perfect, you want to go into
a new career with your eyes open, as aware of the whole story as possible.
In addition to asking questions, keep your eyes and ears open during your visit. You can 
discover a fair amount about the company culture by observing what happens around you.
240
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Take in as much information as you can by sensing the pace, checking out the décor, notic-
ing how work groups are laid out, and observing interactions among co-workers. Can you
imagine yourself working there?
After the interview comes the wait. This wait isn’t easy for anybody. While you’re waiting,
give your interviewer a reason to remember you. Send a note to those you interviewed with
to thank them for their time. Reiterate your interest in the position.
Depending on the job market, events at the company, the scheduling of other interviews,
and what you were told at the end of your interview, you may get a call immediately, or you
may not hear from the interviewer for a week or so.
If you don’t hear from the interviewer or your recruiter when you think you should, place a
call. Thank the person for the interview, reiterate your interest in the job, and, if the person
doesn’t have any news, ask when you should follow up again. Listen to what the interviewer
or recruiter says. A delay doesn’t necessarily mean bad news. The company may have more
people to interview, a key decision-maker may be out of town, or the company may have
had another job open up unexpectedly, which means the company’s interviewing resources
are spread over two candidate searches. If time passes and you still haven’t heard anything,
place another call.
Even as every cell in your body waits for the phone to ring, keep talking with contacts, keep
track of any openings that are available, and keep interviewing in case this job offer falls
through. Balance your job search activities with stress relievers such as exercising, socializ-
ing, and relaxing with a good novel.
Evaluating your options
Now that you feel fairly certain about what you want and need in your work life, don’t let
the excitement of ﬁnding a possible job make you forget everything you’ve discovered
about your needs.
Think about all you know about each job you’ve interviewed for so far. How well does each
job ﬁt your needs? To create an objective comparison, assess how well each position fulﬁlls
your personal needs in Worksheet 19-1 and your environmental needs in Worksheet 19-2.
Use the following symbols to rate each job on the elements in your list. Be as honest with
yourself as possible as you complete this assessment process using the following rating
system:
 +: I am likely to have this element in this job.
 0: I may have this element some of the time, but not all of the time.
 –: I’m unlikely to have this element in this job.
 ?: I’m not sure that this element is likely to be present in this job.
Sometimes, at ﬁrst blush, a potential job may appear great, but how does it really compare
to your current or most recent job? In the third column of Worksheets 19-1 and 19-2, evalu-
ate your prior job, using the same elements and scoring system. Doing so helps you see
whether your new options are a better ﬁt or not. If the new position is a better ﬁt, you’re on
your way. If it’s not, take a moment to evaluate how taking this job improves your situation.
Perhaps it gives you valuable experience in a new arena or is closer to home, which cuts
your commute. Whatever your rationale, be clear about why you want to take the job.

Chapter 19: Turning Your Dream Career into a Reality

Look at the overall patterns revealed in Worksheets 19-1 and 19-2.
 Do you see more +’s than –’s for one job than another?
 Are there too many ?’s or 0’s in one column for your comfort? Ask your recruiter or
other people who work at the company questions to gain the information you need
to resolve any crucial unknowns.
 Are any of the –’s deal breakers or trade-offs?
A deal breaker is an element of the job that directly conﬂicts with your needs or those of
your family. Taking a job with this kind of clash means that you sacriﬁce a crucial part of
your desired lifestyle. Depending on your lifestyle, deal breakers might be too much travel,
too long a commute, or too much required evening or weekend work.
A trade-off is something that you can give up or take on in order to have the rest of the job
which does suit you. For example, trade-offs may include more client interaction than you
would prefer, a more formal dress code than is ideal, or a location that’s too far from home
to walk to work.
If you come face to face with a deal breaker, share your concerns with your hiring manager
or your recruiter, if you’re working with one, immediately.
Don’t hide your concerns from your recruiter or hiring manager. Be upfront about what you
discover. Because bringing up concerns is always uncomfortable, there is no good time to
have this conversation. Yet have it, you must. If you’re clear enough about your concerns
during your interview, mention it then. If your concerns become clear after your interview,
place a call to the person you’ve been working with. You must do your best to share your
thoughts before you actually receive an offer.
When you share your perspective, listen to the recruiter’s or hiring manager’s explanation,
but hold ﬁrm if you feel the issue can’t be resolved. No matter how good the job looks, if 
a deal breaker lurks in the details, you face a no-win situation. Better to back off now than
after you’re fully involved in the position or lifestyle. If the job looks like a great oppor-
tunity, walking away won’t be easy, but then again, trying to work and live in a situation 
that you know from the get-go won’t work can be pure misery.
A trade-off is a different matter. In this situation, only you can determine whether you can
live with the consequences of taking a position that includes this particular element. Take
some time to brainstorm ways to minimize the impact the trade-off may have on your family
and your work life. Check in with your recruiter to see whether anything can be done to
align the job more closely with your needs.
Receiving an offer
When hiring managers extend an offer, they expect you to say yes with great enthusiasm. If
you feel confused or uneasy at the thought of receiving an offer from one of the companies
you interview with, take some time to think through the situation before the offer is pre-
sented to you. Is a deal breaker or trade-off bothering you (see the preceding section for
more information on deal breakers and trade-offs)? Are you afraid the job isn’t a good ﬁt?
Talk candidly with your recruiter or hiring manager to get to the bottom of the situation.
Go over the offer in detail. Ask the recruiter or hiring manager to clarify any points that
seem unclear. If everyone has communicated clearly, the offer should contain no surprises.
244
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. If the offer comes in with a lower job title, a lower
salary, or fewer beneﬁts than you expected, ask for some time to think over your situation.
Return to the section “Evaluating your options” earlier in this chapter to rate the elements
of the job with this new information in mind. Even if it’s not ideal, is this job still a good
opportunity to expand your experience in your target career area?
After you have a full understanding of exactly what the offer includes, give the recruiter or
hiring manager your answer:
 If the offer isn’t what you expected and doesn’t give you what you need to survive or
thrive, and you’ve tried to negotiate for what you want with no success, you must say
no. As hard as it is to do, walk away, especially if a deal breaker is part of the package.
Although this offer didn’t work out, keep in touch with the recruiter or hiring manager
in case other employment opportunities arise.
 If you determine that you feel comfortable with any trade-offs present in the offer, accept
the position. If you ﬁnd that you need help resolving a trade-off, you may decide to make
your acceptance of the job contingent on ﬁnding solutions together.
 If the offer matches what you were told during the interview process, you can take the
job with some conﬁdence in the communication channels.
After you accept and sign an offer, you need to give notice at your current company, if you
have one.
Although giving two weeks’ notice is customary, be prepared to leave sooner in some cases.
Some companies with sensitive data may walk you out as soon as you resign, giving you
only a moment to pack up your personal items. If you want to have closure with people you
worked with, create a list of phone numbers and e-mail addresses and take it home with you
before you give notice so that you can let these people know where you went.
If you remain for the full two weeks, continue to participate fully. Finish projects, leave
instructions for whoever takes over your active projects, and create closure with those you
worked with. Feel free to daydream about your future career to help the time pass. You may
also have to ﬁeld questions from every corner about where you’re going next. Depending
on the situation, these conversations may be fun because you get to talk about your next
adventure, or they can be a bit awkward if you’re going to a competitor or doing something
that seems like an unusual move to your co-workers. Share as much or as little detail as
feels comfortable.
As you leave one company to join another, share your news with all the people in your net-
work. Thank them again for their assistance and give out your new contact information so
that they can reach you if they ever need your help.
In the changing world of work, keeping in regular contact with your network makes sense.
Although you’re employed today, you may not be in the months and years to come. Having
a solid, active network can make all the difference in your job search.
Feeling at home in your new career
As you walk in the doors of your new career for the ﬁrst time, you enter a different world
with a new language, new players, and new goals. Keep these tips in mind as you settle into
your new profession:
245
Chapter 19: Turning Your Dream Career into a Reality

 Stay calm in the midst of change. Although starting something new can be exciting,
you may also feel a bit unsettled or overwhelmed by the differences. Rather than ﬁght
these feelings, accept that you don’t know, and can’t know, all there is to know yet.
Breathe and give yourself permission to ease into your new career.
 Manage your expectations of yourself. Before you can expect yourself to perform at
the level you did in your last career, you must give yourself time to get a feel for the
ropes. Expecting too much of yourself too soon can sabotage your performance. Have
patience with yourself and the process of learning again.
 Listen to the lingo. Your ﬁrst mission in a new job is to understand the language. Don’t
be shy. Inquire about acronyms and phrases you’ve never heard before. Ask whether
the company has a glossary or translation Web page for new employees. Before criticiz-
ing yourself, remember that acronyms often crop up so rapidly that even seasoned
employees have a hard time keeping track of them.
 Get to know the players. In your previous career, you probably knew whom to contact
for what without even thinking about it. You can reach that point again — it may just
take some time. Sometimes the best person to approach isn’t the obvious choice.
Establish a relationship with a trustworthy co-worker to help you tap into the infra-
structure more quickly.
 Put your best foot forward, staying true to yourself. Obviously, as you start a job in
your new career, you want to make a good impression. To accomplish this, you may go
out of your way to exceed your managers’ expectations. Although you may win points
this way, you may also signiﬁcantly raise the bar of what others expect of you. Don’t
set up unrealistic patterns of availability or productivity if you don’t want to sustain
them. Be clear about your boundaries. Where you can, set limits from the start, so that
your boss and co-workers know how you work.
Although it’s not something you want to think about just now, at some point, you may ﬁnd
this new job isn’t as fulﬁlling as it once was, or that a change in management or the com-
pany mission has irreparably changed your job. Take stock of your situation by reading
Chapter 1. The more involved you are in the strategic side of managing your career, the
fewer surprises you encounter. Check in every three to six months to see how you can
enliven your career.
Goal Three: Launching Your Dream Business
If you’ve done the preliminary planning in Chapter 18, you have a clear concept of your
product or service, your location needs, your competition, and your ﬁnancial funding
options. Now it’s time to start revving your engines.
One of the best ways to ramp up a successful business is to learn as much as you can about
how to run a business. Don’t rely on just what you know. Don’t rely on just the chapters in
this book, because there’s no way to do justice to the topic of starting a business in just a
few pages. Do more research by reaching out for other references. For instance, you might
look at Entrepreneurship For Dummies, by Kathleen Allen, or Starting an Online Business For
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Greg Holden (Wiley).
Creating your business identity
Developing an identity for your business typically involves creating a business name, logo,
and tagline or motto that gives your potential clients a clear understanding of what your
business offers. As you select your colors, font, logo, paper, and Web site design, make sure
246
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

that they appeal to your target market. Whether you hire a designer or do the work yourself,
create the most professional-looking business identity you can afford.
Because your business focus may change as you gain more understanding of what your
clients want, ﬁgure in some room for modiﬁcations and limit your ﬁrst print run of any
printed materials until you’re conﬁdent that your text is ﬁnalized.
Choosing the name of your business takes careful thought and some research. By law, the
name of your business can’t compete with the name of a similar kind of business serving
the same geographic area. If you expect to have only local clients, verify that your name 
is available by checking with the county department that assigns ﬁctitious names and the
state government ofﬁce that tracks corporations and trademarks. Use the Small Business
Administration Web page at www.sba.gov/hotlist/businessnames.html to ﬁnd the right
state ofﬁce for your research.
If you expect to have a national or international clientele, do adequate research to ensure
that the name you want to use is available. Even if you aren’t sure you want to establish a
trademark, you need to do this research, because if someone else owns the trademark, you
have no right to use the name yourself. You can conduct a free initial search, pay for a more
complete research report on the availability of your name for a trademark, and apply for
your trademark by visiting www.nameprotect.com or contacting a trademark lawyer.
You may also want to verify that you can obtain a domain name that works for your business.
Although you may want your domain name to match your business name, consider incorpo-
rating your key beneﬁt into your domain name. For example, when I started the blog for this
book, I chose the domain name, www.findyourdreamcareer.com. Not only is this domain
name easy to spell, but it also spells out the main beneﬁt of the book and is easy to remem-
ber. To investigate whether your preferred domain name is available, visit www.godaddy.com.
After you have your domain name, make each page of your Web site count by writing com-
pelling copy, building a well-organized site, and submitting your site to search engines.
Establishing your work space
To be an effective entrepreneur, you must have a space dedicated to your business. If you
have a store or ofﬁce outside your home, carve out a place within the larger area that you
can call your own. If you plan to work from home, establish a physical location for your
ofﬁce and set up some ground rules with your family so that they know how to interact with
you while you’re working.
As you design your space, pay attention to how you like to work. Don’t spend big bucks 
on a formal desk if you prefer to sit in an easy chair or at a worktable with your laptop.
Modular furniture can be a good investment because, as you and your business grow, you
can rearrange your ofﬁce to ﬁt your changing needs.
Developing sustainable marketing strategies
To get business to come to you, you must create an effective marketing strategy to get the
word out to your prospective clients. For the best results, you must develop a coordinated
strategy that you can sustain over time. Check out Marketing For Dummies by Alexander
Hiam (Wiley) for a variety of ideas.
Marketing is an art. Begin with your best marketing piece, track its successes and failures,
and then modify what doesn’t work or replace it with something that has a better chance of
working.
247
Chapter 19: Turning Your Dream Career into a Reality

To be effective, you must feel comfortable enough with your marketing methods that you can
make them an integral part of doing business. Having three or four strategies you employ con-
sistently is generally more effective than a scattered approach done intermittently.
Just because your business is booming, don’t think you can stop your marketing efforts.
You must market continuously, even when your business is thriving.
Feeling at home in your own business
If you’ve always worked in a corporate situation, becoming an entrepreneur may take some
getting used to. For possibly the ﬁrst time in your life, you can call your own shots, which
may feel refreshing and unnerving all at once.
In a corporate setting, a number of people are involved in making things happen. In your
own business, you are responsible for everything — from keeping your supplies stocked
and handling shipping to negotiating deals and delivering products or services to clients.
You may be absolutely amazed at how long it can take to get what seems like a simple letter
drafted, printed, and out the door to the mail box. Just the handling of everyday correspon-
dence, e-mails, and phone calls can consume your entire day.
At some point, you may ﬁnd it worth the expense to hire someone to help out with certain
tasks. Keep the following tips in mind when considering recruiting help from others:
 Start by making a list of all the tasks that must be done to run your business and pro-
vide your product or service to your clients.
 Group the tasks by functions, such as administration, development, production, mar-
keting, sales, inventory and distribution, and customer follow-up.
 Identify the tasks that you enjoy doing and are good at.
 As you look at the remaining tasks, ask yourself whether you are the best person to do
a particular task. If you have the skills but lack the desire, you can handle it, but if you
lack both the skill and the desire, you’re probably better off ﬁnding someone to sup-
port that aspect of your business. This is especially true if you tend to procrastinate
each time you need to handle the task.
 Go through all the tasks and group the ones you’d rather not handle. As you look at the
list, think about who may be able to help you step toward your dream. Do you have
a family member who can pitch in or a friend who has some extra time on her hands?
Does an independent contractor have the specialty that you need or could you hire
an employee to take on particular tasks?.
If you choose to hire employees, you must look at the tax and liability implications of your
decision. The Small Business Administration has a Start-Up Kit for New Employers, which
outlines the basics. A conversation with your accountant is also in order.
Faced with your growing to-do list, you may feel that you must tackle everything today. The
truth is that you shouldn’t even try to do that.
As you begin each day or week, identify the tasks that must get done on that particular day.
Then focus your attention on accomplishing those tasks and putting out any ﬁres that crop
up during the day. If you make a dent in your list, call it a good day. Over time and with
experience, you’ll ﬁnd it easier to create a focus for the day and stick with it.
Although you may have strategic decisions looming over you, discipline yourself not to
obsess over them, especially if you can’t or don’t have all the information you need to make
248
Part IV: Bringing Your Dream Career to Life 

the decision. If you get thoughts or ideas about a decision you must make farther down the
road, by all means make note of them.
Attempting to make strategic decisions while in the midst of handling your day-to-day busi-
ness affairs is like mixing oil and water. Set aside a day or weekend to get away from your
business environment so that you can clear your head enough to make sound, long-range
decisions for your business.
Learning from each experience
You will make mistakes. Expect it and accept it. Whether you lack the experience, use poor
judgment, or make a decision based on inadequate assumptions, you may wish you could
redo any number of decisions, especially when you ﬁrst start out.
Take any frustration and embarrassment you have with yourself and move it into a more
proactive direction instead. First evaluate the situation. Determine whether you can salvage
the situation by having another conversation with the party involved, or if the next decision
you make can reverse the damage. If neither scenario is possible, your only option may be
to let it go.
Rather than berate yourself, think through how you would handle the situation differently if
given the chance. Then the next time you face a similar situation, call upon your experience
to guide you to a better decision.
Finding the balance in your new life
When you ﬁrst start your business, you may ﬁnd yourself eating, breathing, and sleeping
your business. No matter how you look at it, a growing business takes a tremendous amount
of dedication and focus.
And yet to succeed, you must keep yourself in tiptop shape. Find ways to eke out enough
time and space for yourself, your family, and your friendships. Several strategies may help,
including the following:
 Combining activities: If you make friends with other entrepreneurs, you can set up
a regular time to problem-solve, brainstorm, or offer support while having lunch or
taking a walk.
 Creating boundaries: Designate a certain time of day or day of the week where you
step away from your business and your responsibilities. When you take this time off,
you must discipline your mind to let go of work, as well.
Ensuring a Smooth Transition 
into Your Next Career
Regardless of which goal you’re going after, several factors impact the pace and intensity of
how your journey to your new venture unfolds.
Use Worksheet 19-3 to ascertain the parameters that are likely to inﬂuence your transition
most. Use the following list of questions to deepen your thinking.
249
Chapter 19: Turning Your Dream Career into a Reality

 Your status at your current job: Do you enjoy your job? Is it critical that you get out of
your job immediately? Are you okay hanging out in your current position while you put
new pieces into place? Are there any ways your current job limits you in taking the
actions you need to take? Can you ﬁnd any other more creative ways to keep money
ﬂowing in while you put your plan into action?
 Your time horizon: In an ideal world, when would you like to be transitioning into your
new venture? From a realistic standpoint, what does your time frame look like? When
can you start making your move? Are there milestone dates you can target?
 Your available funds: How is your ﬁnancial situation impacting your choices? Do you
have the funds you need to invest in yourself? If so, create a budget and stick to it. If
not, how can you come up with the funds you need? Do you need a cash-producing job
for the short term, do you need to ﬁnd a loan, or do you need to scale back your initial
plans?
 Your current skill level: Do you have all the training you need? What are the gaps you
need to ﬁll? How and when are you going to do this? Review Chapter 18 to think through
your best strategy to build the skills you need.
 Your family’s needs: How do your family’s needs impact your decisions and actions?
Chapter 4 helps you look at this question in more detail. What new systems or support
resources can you put in place to free up your time and energy?
 Your location realities: What’s true about your location that impacts the unfolding 
of your venture? Do you need to restructure your ofﬁce? Do you need to rent space? 
Do you need to move?

As you clarify where you stand with each issue, focus on each one to see how you can mas-
sage it to work with your ultimate plan. If you’re really stumped, use the brainstorming
activity in Chapter 17 to ﬁnd creative ways to weave all of your considerations and goals
into a workable plan.
Record your best plan in Worksheet 19-4. Revisit your plan periodically to update it as your
situation evolves.
You can plan the timing and pace of your transition to take your personal factors into
account. You have several options to choose from:
 Make the leap: One option, the one most people think of ﬁrst, is to just take the leap.
Jump into school, your new job, or your business, without looking back. This option
takes some inner strength to handle the abrupt, potentially risky nature of this path.
For a time, you are the trapeze artist who’s suspended in midair between bars. If you
have a good safety net in place (think money and moral support), this path may work.
 Easing out of one and into another. It you don’t have the constitution for an all-at-
once jump, you may feel more comfortable easing from one situation to another. With
this overlap, you may be quite busy, but you have a chance to resolve any unforeseen
problems before you completely let go of the old. This path means you’re in transition
longer, so your tolerance for being in motion versus your need to feel settled may
deﬁne how long this in-between plan works for you.
 Doubling up for a time: You may discover that your best course is to keep your cur-
rent job and go back to school, or keep your current job while you get your business
going. This path gives you a bit of security and stability. Although your ultimate inten-
tion is to shift out of the old, you feel no sense of urgency to complete the deed.
 Creating a composite career: In this model, you purposely weave your various paths
together so that you have multiple streams of income and enjoy multiple ways to
express and use your talents. Sometimes the threads of your composite career are 
similar in that they capitalize on related topics or skills. In other cases, your fabric is
woven from several completely unrelated talents, skills, and interests. If this work style
appeals to you, the ﬂexible nature of your work is probably a crucial piece of your
career puzzle.

creative ways to transition into your new adventure.

Ten Ways to Confirm Your Dream Career
Won’t Be a Nightmare
In This Chapter
 Getting information from a class, Web sites, or journals
 Meeting and observing people in your ideal careers
 Finding a way to get hands-on experience
 Determining how a new career will affect your lifestyle
A
career idea has captured your attention. You know something about this potential
career from visiting Web sites, doing informational interviews, and reading about the
work, but you still don’t know whether it’s the right career for you. Now is the best time to
test the waters to discover all you can about the work you’re considering.
In this chapter you ﬁnd ten ways to experiment with the profession in question to ensure
that you fully understand and enjoy the work, the professional community, and the work’s
impact on you and your life.
Depending on how familiar you are with your idea, your exploration may take a couple weeks
to several months. Write down your observations periodically so that you won’t have to
reconstruct your impressions when the time comes to make a decision to move forward.
Paying Attention to How You Feel
As you try on your new career, using the methods described in this chapter, the most impor-
tant thing you can do is pay attention to how you feel each step of the way. Your visceral
reaction as you step closer to the profession speaks volumes as long as you’re willing to
listen. Whether it’s love or loathing at ﬁrst sight, these feelings are likely to become even
more intense if you actually decide to work in the ﬁeld.
Always base your conclusions on your reactions to multiple sources of information and on
the quality of your source. For instance, don’t give as much weight to a disgruntled member
of the profession as you would to information you gather from a reputable trade journal.
If you come across information that troubles you, calm yourself down and then do more
investigation until you have a full, informed picture of the situation. If you discover conﬂicting
information or information that doesn’t ﬁt your needs, don’t abandon your dream prema-
turely. Use Chapters 16 and 17 to ﬁnd a creative solution that resolves your concern.

Taking a Relevant Class or Two
Early in your exploration, look for a short course that can give you a taste of your potential
career. Your goal is not to get fully trained in the ﬁeld at this point, but to explore whether
the ﬁeld is a good ﬁt for you.
Pick up class schedules for local community colleges, universities with local satellite 
campuses, and specialty schools in your area or search the Internet for online courses or 
teleclasses. Look for an introductory course or a course that deepens your knowledge.
As you take the course, notice whether you feel excited by the material or bored. If you’re
excited, pay special attention to what aspects of the course intrigue you most. If you’re
bored, is it because the class is too elementary or because the topic isn’t as interesting as
you thought? Is there a related topic that might be more interesting?
If you run across a full-degree or certiﬁcation program, make note of it but don’t commit to
it — even if it looks like a perfect match. Starting a training program before you’ve conﬁrmed
your direction limits your career investigation and your future career choices.
Searching for Online Sources of Information
As you search the Internet for informative Web sites about your target career, keep your
eyes open for relevant online newsletters, discussion boards, and blogs that can tell you
more about your possible career and profession.
Each of these resources is free and takes just a moment of your time to read. In return, you
gain access to hot topics within the ﬁeld, key events for professionals like yourself, crucial
issues that may impact how you work, new techniques and perspectives you can incorpo-
rate into your work, and key players in the ﬁeld.
Bookmark any items that appear relevant. As you become more familiar with the ﬁeld and
reﬁne the direction of your career change, review what you’ve saved to see what other
angles, contacts, and companies may be salient.
If you aren’t running across discussion groups and blogs in your exploration of your target
career, use these directories to ﬁnd relevant places to visit:
 Yahoo! Groups (http://groups.yahoo.com): Access a group by using the search
function or by scanning the groups under categories that interest you.
 Monster.com (http://discussion.monster.com/messageboards/): This site includes
several profession-speciﬁc message boards as well as several boards for particular situa-
tions such as age issues, diversity at work, contract, and temping.
 Wetfeet (www.wetfeet.com/discuss/home.asp): You ﬁnd career and industry boards
on this site as well as a number of topical boards.
 Blogarama (www.blogarama.com): If you want to ﬁnd a blog by someone in your target
profession, visit this site for a directory of blog categories. The Business/ Professional
link lists blogs that comment on particular industries, jobs, and companies. You may
also ﬁnd the search function to be helpful if you can be speciﬁc enough about your 
keywords.
 Globe of Blogs (www.globeofblogs.com/?x=topic): This link takes you to a direc-
tory of blog topics. Click on Careers and Occupations for a list of professions and the
number of related blogs. Click away until you ﬁnd the ones that interest you.

Immersing Yourself in Trade Journals
Another valuable source of information comes from trade journals. Ask your professional
contacts what they read to stay on top of industry news. Whether online or in print, trade
journals offer you a more in-depth look at the profession.
Depending on the publication source, you may gain access to the views of the professional
association, an independent journalistic source, or an alliance of vendors. As you read, make
a point of identifying the source and the source’s place in the industry or profession.
Reading a trade journal gives you a window into the priorities, politics, profession-speciﬁc
language, and humor associated with the industry or profession. If elements of these areas
are counter to your interests, pay attention! Now is the time to become aware of a lack of ﬁt
if there is one.
Your reading also gives you a synopsis of current and past events, upcoming special events,
and key issues that are impacting the profession. Gaining an accurate understanding of the
state of the profession is crucial to your ultimate comfort as you step into the career.
Interacting with People in the Field
As you consider becoming an active member of a profession, ﬁnd ways to interact with others
in the profession. One of the best places to start is to locate a local chapter of a key profes-
sional association. Attending these meetings allows you to get a sense of how it feels to be in
the company of those in your target profession. You can learn a lot by listening, observing,
and interacting with others in the community. In the process, you enrich your understanding
of the career, begin building a thriving network, learn from more experienced members, hear
about local job leads, and enhance your visibility within the profession.
Some chapters allow you to attend their local meetings as a guest before you become a full-
ﬂedged member. To make the most of the meetings, follow these guidelines:
 Attend several meetings before you decide whether to stop going. This advice holds
true even if you feel uncomfortable at the meetings at ﬁrst. (The truth is that almost
everyone feels somewhat uncomfortable walking into a room full of strangers.) The
only reason to cut this plan short is if the group’s purpose is clearly not a good match
for you.
 Announce yourself. Tell the person at the door that you’re attending for the ﬁrst time
so that he or she can introduce you to people right off the bat.
 Think about how to introduce yourself before you walk into the meeting. Write your
introduction down if it helps to have something prepared in front of you.
 Introduce yourself to the people sitting around you. Asking questions about the organi-
zation is a good way to start a conversation. If you want to follow up with someone after
the meeting, ask for the person’s business card. Always bring a supply of your own cards
as well. You can create a simple business card at your local ofﬁce supply store or on your
own computer.
 Notice who plays key roles during the meeting. Keep their names and faces in mind
for future reference.
The more frequently you attend chapter meetings, the more people you recognize, and the
more comfortable you become. Another way to feel at ease is to reconnect with people out-
side the meeting. Several days after you meet someone, e-mail or call to share a book title, a
257
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Conﬁrm Your Dream Career Won’t Be a Nightmare

recent article, or the phone number of a contact you discussed. If you sense that you have 
a lot in common with someone in the initial conversation, invite the person to join you for
lunch or coffee. Although you can’t expect every interaction to result in a long-term connec-
tion, you never know where a connection will lead you.
Don’t let a hot or warm connection drop away out of ambivalence or apathy on your part.
Even if you aren’t sure there’s a match, take a chance and check it out.
Attending a Professional Conference
A professional conference can be a great place to get a sense of a profession while building
your skills. As you review conference brochures that come across your desk at work, evaluate
how the conference could give you a better understanding of your target career. This oppor-
tunity is especially likely if your new career is related to your current position.
If your target career isn’t related to your current career, your inbox probably isn’t going to
deliver the information you need to ﬁnd a conference that’s relevant to your target career.
Instead, turn to trade journals, association Web sites, professional discussion groups, or
your informational interview contacts to identify possible conferences that meet your needs.
Keep your eye out for regional conferences as well as national or international opportunities.
If you see a strong link between the conference and your work and can convince your man-
ager of its value, the company may even foot the bill for some of your expenses. If your
company chooses not to fund your trip, or if the conference is something you ﬁnd on your
own, do what you have to do to attend. Take some vacation time, use your frequent-ﬂier
miles to get there, stay with a friend, or pay for the conference yourself, if necessary.
As you set up your personal agenda for the conference, read the conference brochure and
preconference workshop descriptions carefully for opportunities. Consider the following:
 If a session addresses a new software package that’s essential for people in your target
career to use, sit in on that session.
 If you see a niche or application that you’ve never heard of before, explore it to see
whether it gives you a better understanding of your new career.
 If a key expert is giving a talk on a topic that has always confused you, attend the ses-
sion so that you can resolve your confusion before you enter your new ﬁeld.
Observing Someone on the Job
Watching someone interacting with clients, co-workers, suppliers, and management and
doing the tasks you might perform gives you a great opportunity to evaluate how well that
potential career ﬁts you and your needs.
Before you ask your contacts if you can shadow them for a couple hours or a day, think
through what you hope to gain from the experience. (To discover how to ﬁnd contacts in
careers you’re interested in, turn to Chapter 15.) Make a list of what you want to look for
during the observation. Build in time at the beginning of the appointment to determine the
length of your observation time, whether you can take notes about what you see, and the
appropriate time to ask questions — for example, on the spot or during a break.
258
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If watching someone as he works isn’t possible, see whether you can meet the person at his
workplace for a conversation or for lunch. Seeing the work environment can also give you a
feel for how it might be to work in that environment.
Talking to People Outside the Field
To make sure that you get the full picture of your target career, don’t limit yourself to talking
with only those who do the job you want. Think of others you may interact with on the job.
You might gain a unique perspective of your target career by talking with vendors, potential
customers, professional colleagues who work at a similar level but hold different jobs, or
individuals who report to the position you’re targeting.
Use your current contacts to gain access to people in these various roles. No matter whom
you end up talking to, each person can help you reach your goal of broadening your under-
standing of the job.
Getting Hands-On Experience
To get some hands-on experience with your new profession (and strengthen job-relevant skills
while you’re at it), search for a way to work on a project that’s relevant to you. You might
consider volunteering to work on a relevant project or committee within a nonproﬁt, taking
a part-time job, getting an internship, or helping a friend with a project. This extra project
doesn’t necessarily need to be a long-term commitment. Your goal is to see how it feels to
engage in this sort of work.
If you have a difﬁcult time ﬁnding an appropriate opportunity in your area of interest, visit
www.idealist.org, www.onlinevolunteering.org, or www.volunteermatch.org for
local, global, and online volunteer opportunities that relate to careers that appeal to you. 
Or explore internship and short-term options by putting the term “internships” and your
chosen ﬁeld into your search engine. Although some internships are geared toward stu-
dents or recent graduates, opportunities do exist for others as well.
With some ingenuity, you may even ﬁnd a way to get some hands-on experience within
your current company. After researching your organization to identify experiences that
most closely match your target career, build a case for doing a rotation in that department.
Be sure to lay out the beneﬁts to the company and the details of how your proposal would
work. Have several variations worked out in your mind so that if your employer doesn’t buy
into your original plan, you can present her with some other attractive options. For exam-
ple, your manager may ﬂinch at the idea of assigning you to another department for several
months, but she may see value in allowing you to do some cross-training in the same depart-
ment over a couple weeks. As you work in the new department, take advantage of any
opportunities to strengthen skills you know you need to succeed in your target career.
Assessing the Impact on Your Lifestyle
A truly fulﬁlling career gives you professional satisfaction and also allows you to live the life
you want. Rather than assuming that your new career and its related lifestyle will work for
you and your family, take some time to verify that you’re comfortable with the changes.
259
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Conﬁrm Your Dream Career Won’t Be a Nightmare

Whether you’re interested in rural living, telecommuting, working part time while parenting,
being an entrepreneur, or another lifestyle, you can gain insight about your new life by trying
on your new lifestyle for a few days or by spending time with people who are living the life
you think you want.
Begin by inventing ways to mimic your desired lifestyle for a few days in your current situa-
tion. Even if your efforts aren’t completely accurate, you can at least get an idea of how you
might respond to living this way over time.
During the days you’ve set aside for your experiment, live as if you’ve already made the
transition to your new lifestyle or work arrangement. From the moment you wake up in the
morning until the time you go to bed, approach your life through this new lens. How might
you interact with others? Would you think about different things? Start acting the part you
want to play. Although creating a new way to live evolves over time, you can begin to get a
sense of whether the change is a good ﬁt for you.
Sometimes the idea of something feels better than the reality. Don’t just focus on the rosy
parts of the picture. Notice what makes you feel uneasy about this way of living and work-
ing. What do you need to explore in more detail as a result of this experience? Be as realistic
as you can about determining whether this transition would be a good one for you.
Use the following ideas to start planning your experiment:
 If you want your new career to be part-time: If your job allows, set up a week when
you work three out of ﬁve days or when you leave early three days in a row. Notice how
the time off impacts your life. Project how the decrease in salary might affect you.
 If your new career is entrepreneurial: Think about what your workday would look 
like as an entrepreneur. Would you work at home? Out on the road? In a small ofﬁce?
At client sites? If you’re currently in a job, take a couple of days or a week off and use
the time to explore this work style and lifestyle. Even if you use the week to get your
business plan in order, you can discover what it feels like to plan your own day and
ﬁnd the self-discipline to do what needs to get done. If you have children, arrange for
day care as you would if you were running your own business.
 If your new career involves relocating: Take a couple trips to scope out the new area.
If the move means a longer commute, drive the commute several days in a row — during
rush hour, of course! — to get a feel for the trafﬁc, travel time, and alternate routes.
Your next step is to ﬁnd others who are doing what you want to do (Chapter 15 might 
give you some ideas on ﬁnding these people). If you don’t know someone you can visit, talk
about your desired lifestyle with people you know or meet. Often people pipe up and say,
“Oh, Janet’s sister is doing the very same thing!” Follow up to see whether you can connect
in person. If the potential contact lives too far away to meet in person, set up a conversa-
tion by phone or via e-mail.
To make full use of your visit, make your appointment at a time when you can witness the
aspects of the lifestyle that concern you the most, which could be the morning shufﬂe of
getting the kids off to school before work, returning home after a long commute, or working
at home with toddlers in the house.
Come with a prepared list of questions to ask. Observe the environment and what happens
in the home. Notice the interruptions. Get a feel for the ﬂow of activity. Don’t get discouraged
by what you see. Instead, use what you observe to think through how a potential change might
unfold in your home. Get creative to come up with ways to counteract things that may not
work smoothly at ﬁrst.

Ten Creative Ways to Make the 
Leap to Your Dream Career
In This Chapter
 Making the most of your current income
 Creating a way to use a mix of jobs to make your transition
 Using your own business to implement the change
 Finding ways to return to school
W
hen all is said and done, the biggest factor in your transition from one career to the
next is money. Although you’d love to just quit your current job and dive headlong
into your new career, ﬁnancial realities keep you from acting rashly. The truth is that you
need to continue to make a certain amount of money to survive as you make your move.
To transition as gracefully and effectively as possible, think through the best way to choreo-
graph your entry into a new job, your own business, or back to school. In this chapter, you
ﬁnd ten creative ways to move from where you are now to where you want to be.
Some options may be a better ﬁt for your circumstances than others. Feel free to mix and
match if you see a way to combine parts of several strategies to meet your needs.
Regardless of the path you take to reach your dream career, keep your focus on the essence
of what you want for yourself and your life. Keeping this focus as you implement your plan
allows you to discern your best next step each time you face a key decision. When you feel
stuck because you can’t identify a direct path to your goal, brainstorm possible solutions,
using Chapter 17 as your guide.
Using Your Current Income Wisely
If you know that a career change is in your future, be proactive in getting your ﬁnancial house
in order. An honest assessment of your ﬁnancial situation, while you’re still employed if possi-
ble, gives you far more options in the long run than assuming you know where you stand.
Before you initiate your move to change careers, make as much progress as you can toward
the following four initiatives:
 Increasing your savings: Sign up for an automatic transfer to your savings account.
Create a monthly or weekly savings goal and do everything in your power to reach it.
 Reducing your monthly expenses: Look at every monthly expense you have. Does the
value it provides match what you pay for it? Is it an essential expense? Eliminate bills
where you can; downgrade others if possible. Don’t focus only on your small expenses;
take this opportunity to evaluate your biggest expenses as well to see whether you can
ﬁnd a creative way to restructure them.

 Eliminating, or at least signiﬁcantly reducing, your debt: Whether you make payments
toward student loans, a car loan, or a credit card balance, your income requirement is
likely to decrease rather dramatically as you eliminate each source of debt.
 Practicing living within your means: When you launch your new career, you don’t
want to rack up new debts to replace the ones you’ve just paid off. Instead, you need 
to get in the habit of living within your means — without the use of plastic. When you
begin acting on these initiatives, your discretionary income, the money you get to use
for whatever you wish, decreases dramatically because most of it is going into savings
or to pay down your debt. This doesn’t mean you have to stop having fun; it just means
you need to become a little more inventive when it comes to planning your social life,
vacations, and weekday lunches.
Taking a serious look at these initiatives and following up with the necessary actions is impor-
tant if you’re moving into a target career that’s likely to lower your salary in the short term.
If you’re going back to school or starting a business, these steps are crucial to your long-term
success.
Don’t worry — this ﬁnancial situation may not be a life sentence. In addition, gaining control
of your ﬁnancial situation opens up more options than it closes. Imagine knowing with cer-
tainty that you could, if you chose to, work part time to care for your children or go back to
school for a year. Without having an accurate assessment of your situation, your options are
limited by the assumptions, fears, and worst-case scenarios that spin in your head.
Supplementing Your Full-Time 
Position with Part-Time Work
Taking on a part- time job on top of your regular job can be a viable strategy if you want to
do any of the following:
 Build your cash reserves
 Gain some experience in your new ﬁeld
 Develop a particular skill
 Strengthen your network of contacts within a new ﬁeld
 Add new breadth to your resume
If you’re going to invest your time and effort in a second job, get some extra bang for your
buck by ﬁnding a part-time job that’s in alignment with your target career in some way.
Think about what you want this job to do for you. Do you want to use the job to get a look
at your target industry, to strengthen one key skill you need to move forward, or to check
out the competition of your target company?
By taking the time to sort through your long-term priorities and goals, you’re more likely to
beneﬁt from your stint at your part-time job.
Doing Contract Work
Although you may think that your only option is to land a full-time job, your chances of
landing a job improve if you open your mind to include the possibility of taking on project
262
Part V: The Part of Tens 

or contract work. Although a series of short-term gigs may not ﬁt your ideal picture, having
some money coming in while you gain some relevant experience isn’t anything to sneeze at.
The world economy has shifted. More and more companies are turning to a project-based
philosophy that allows them to hire just the talent they need to complete a particular proj-
ect. As soon as a project is ﬁnished, the company releases those they no longer need.
Although there’s always a chance that your contract will be extended or converted to full-
time, you can’t know that for sure. Given the ﬂuid nature of the economic climate, you may
move from contract work to a full-time position, and back to freelance work over the course
of a couple years. Living with this level of unfolding security takes a certain level of conﬁ-
dence and trust.
Your best bet is to become comfortable with this ﬂuid reality because it’s here to stay. The
keys to surviving or — better yet — thriving in this kind of economy are understanding all
the skills and talents you bring to the party, being able to articulate the beneﬁts you provide,
and having an active, well-connected network that is plugged into what’s happening in your
industry and your target companies.
Instead of thinking of yourself as an employee, begin thinking of yourself as the head of your
own operation. Scan the horizon consistently to know when things are turning and when
opportunities are available. Make the most-informed decisions you can about the best ways
to promote your talent, both for your own future and for your customers, whether they’re
employers, clients, or contractors.
One side beneﬁt to this work format is the opportunity to test out a company or an industry
sector to see how you like it — before you enter into a long-term, full-time commitment.
Another beneﬁt, if you have skills that are sought after, is that you can call the shots to some
degree. You can accept jobs that look interesting, turn away jobs that aren’t a good ﬁt, and
choose to give yourself some time off for travel or study. The latter is obviously far more
comfortable if you’re conﬁdent that more jobs are in the pipeline.
Helping a Friend While Bringing In a Paycheck
Another way to build your skills is to use your talents to help out a friend with a project or a
business task. Whether it’s helping a friend organize her wedding, market a new product, or
do some ﬁnancial analysis, you have the opportunity to test how it feels to do the work, to
identify where you want to get more training, and to have some fun along the way.
Don’t accept just any offer, however. Take your time to analyze your situation from a strate-
gic vantage point ﬁrst. Think through the following steps before you make a proposal.
1. Reafﬁrm your long-term career goal.
2. Take an inventory of the skills you already possess.
3. Decide what skills you want to develop.
4. Figure out what your friend’s actual needs are.
To be a good match, your skills must overlap with your friend’s needs to enough of a
degree that your friend truly beneﬁts from the alliance.
5. Decide what you’re willing to offer your friend.
Based on your skills and the areas you want to develop and your friend’s needs, what
solution is coming to mind? Do you want to consult on the subject at hand, do a research
263
Chapter 21: Ten Creative Ways to Make the Leap to Your Dream Career

project, or work with your friend to achieve a goal? Be as speciﬁc as possible as you
formulate your offering.
6. Consider your goals in doing this project.
How do you beneﬁt in the long run?
As you piece together your proposal and plan, remember to do the following:
 Stay focused on the present project. Don’t get seduced into thinking this is the ﬁrst
step to a long-term partnership. That’s like planning your wedding during your ﬁrst
date, and you all probably know how well that scenario plays out!
 Specify the exact parameters and deliverables for the proposed project. Don’t prom-
ise the moon and don’t fall into the trap of saying you can ﬁgure something out later.
You want to be as clear as possible upfront about what you can and will provide.
 Put your proposal in writing and put both of your signatures on the document. If your
friend balks at such a business-like action, explain that you want to practice each step
as if she’s a client. Having a written agreement means that you both have something to
look back to if your memory of the details differs from your friend’s memory.
 Develop an exit plan that you both agree upon. Completing a project with your integrity
intact is just as important as starting on good footing. Think beyond the beginning of the
project. How will you both know when the project is ﬁnished? How might you want to
use the ﬁnal results to advance your career? Come to agreement about each of these
issues before you start working on the project.
With forethought and honesty from both parties, doing a project for a friend is a win-win for
everyone involved. If you leap-frog over a step or jump in headﬁrst, the entire project and
the friendship can turn into a lose-lose proposition without much warning.
Adding a Part-Time Business 
to Your Full-Time Job
Adding a part-time business can give you a leg up when it comes to gaining new skills or
launching your ultimate venture. A part-time business on the side allows you to get your
feet wet, build your client base, and reﬁne the exact form your business will take while you
still pull in a regular paycheck.
Yes, you’ll be busy, but it’s a good busy — one that ﬁres you up each morning, motivating
you to step into your new role with excitement and optimism.
Think about your future goal and the realities of your current job to ﬁnd a part-time busi-
ness and business format that blend well. Can you see a few clients or do a few projects
at night or on the weekend? Can you build an online business that provides services 24/7
while you work?
After you have a business idea that’s a reasonably good match, consider how, when, and
where to market your services. The success of your business depends on your ability to
make prospective clients aware of your products or services. Look for local networking
groups in your area. Ask your friends about local online networking lists that communicate
with each other via e-mail. Set up an online marketing strategy. Build your momentum by
making marketing a regular part of your week’s activities.

Running Your Own Business with 
a Well-Paying Part-Time Job
Whether you’re building up a business that has been part-time or leaving a full-time gig to
start a business, it never hurts to have a regular paycheck coming in. With a part-time job
that covers your basic expenses, you have a better chance of approaching your business
with hope, creativity, and focus.
The minute you don’t know where rent or dinner is coming from, your business begins to
suffer from your feelings of fear and scarcity. You begin holding back because you don’t
know which move will create the big results you need to get back on your feet ﬁnancially.
You lose your stomach for experimentation and new marketing schemes. You spend so
much time worrying about and scrambling after money to pay the bills that you have no
energy to think strategically about your best long-term moves.
A part-time job can provide a number of key beneﬁts besides a stable source of cash. Think
through what you want this job to do for you. Do you want a job that gives you the highest
pay per hour worked, gives you social interactions to balance out your solo entrepreneur
lifestyle, or blends well with the off hours of your business? Think through your priorities to
find the job that offers what you need without impinging too much on your business success.
Working part time means that you can devote your key hours to building your business. Your
ultimate goal may be to build your business to the point where you no longer need the part-
time job, or you may ﬁnd comfort in knowing that the part-time job offers a dependable
level of income that gives you more ﬂexibility with less stress.
Adding a Second Business
If you decide to start two businesses of your own, launching a couple businesses at the
same time isn’t a good idea. A better approach is to launch them sequentially, especially if
one leverages off another or is completely different. This kind of composite career creates
multiple streams of income that may allow you to cover seasonal dips in your income or
weather the loss of a key customer.
Begin by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of your current business. Obviously you
have a reason for wanting to start another business. Perhaps your goal is to increase your
income potential or to build a business that’s ultimately a better ﬁt for you.
When you think about the tasks you do and the customers you reach, do you see any over-
lap or opening for potential? If the businesses are similar, you may be able to increase your
offerings and quickly build sales with your existing base of customers. If the businesses are
quite different, you probably want to verify that you have two distinct marketing strategies
so you don’t confuse your customers.
Strengthening Your Position through Consulting
If you decide to use your key strengths in a consulting role as you build toward your dream
career, use your consulting gigs to get to know your ultimate target customer. Consciously
take projects that allow you to use your talents to get into your target market’s world. When
you’re inside, make good use of the opportunity to observe, ask questions, and get a feel for
your target market.
265
Chapter 21: Ten Creative Ways to Make the Leap to Your Dream Career

As your knowledge increases and deepens, you have a great opportunity to ﬁne-tune your
plan. You might refocus your approach based on new information. You might identify a need
that no one is ﬁlling, or you might see that your competition in the market is losing its edge
or missing the point. The insider perspective gives you the background you need to make a
big splash when you open the doors to your business or go after your dream job.
This strategy increases your chances of success because you’re building your venture on
real-life observations and knowledge rather than assumptions and theory. Knowing what
your clients or employer need and are willing to pay for is what takes you to the bank.
Working Full Time While Attending 
School Part Time
Face it: Returning to school while working full time is no easy feat! You need a fair amount 
of motivation and stamina to work all day, attend classes at night, and spend time with 
your studies. Although you must put some aspects of your personal life on hold while you
enhance your training, taking on this lifestyle is well worth the effort if you need a degree 
to go for your dream!
If you truly want to enter your target ﬁeld, look beyond the short-term costs to see the long-
term beneﬁts. In the end, you’ll be more fulﬁlled having trained in your ﬁeld of choice.
If you aren’t able to take on a degree program at this time, consider some alternatives.
Explore your ﬁeld to see whether there’s a related profession that doesn’t require the same
degree of training. Look at the various training options to see which one best ﬁts your needs
and lifestyle. Investigate your company’s education beneﬁts as well. Will it fund some of your
schooling? Is your company at all ﬂexible if your classes meet during work hours? If so, great!
Make the most of your situation. If not, explore other companies in your area to see whether
you can create a more supportive, education-friendly situation. It never hurts to explore.
Regardless of what kind of educational program you decide on, take a careful look at your
life to see where you can streamline your personal life so your attention is focused on meet-
ing your education goal. Look for committees, volunteer projects, peripheral friendships,
and other nonessential commitments to determine whether you’d like to dedicate that time
to your studies. Remember you can return to your favorite projects (or new ones) when you
ﬁnish your program.
Attending School with a Part-Time 
Job on the Side
Another education option is to attend school full time with a part-time job to cover at least
some of your expenses. This option may take some creative ﬁnancing and require that you
change your living situation to lower your rent, but the big beneﬁt of this option is that you
get through the education phase more quickly.
Look for funding at Free Scholarship Search (www.freschinfo.com). Perhaps you can ﬁnd a
way to go to school full time and not work at all during certain key semesters. Although this
idea may seem far-fetched, do yourself a favor and at least check it out, especially if you’re
more productive when you devote all your time and energy to a single goal.
