Foreword by William Corrington
In recent years, “cloud computing” has emerged as a model for providing infor-
mation technology (IT) infrastructure, resources, and services that have the poten-
tial to drive significant value to organizations through increased IT efficiency,
agility, and innovation. However, federal agencies who were early adopters of
cloud computing have learned that there are many challenges and risks that must
be addressed in order to realize these benefits.
These early adopters have learned that the use of a Cloud Service Provider
(CSP) represents a fundamental shift in how IT assets are deployed and delivered
on a day-to-day basis. Successful adoption of cloud computing requires a change
in approach to (among other things) security, privacy, end-user support, opera-
tions, acquisition, and contract management. Challenges exist for CSPs as well.
Many players in this emerging marketplace are new to doing business with the
federal government. As a result, they not only need to learn the nuances of the
federal acquisition processes, they must also address a myriad of security, pri-
vacy, and certification requirements that are specific to federal customers.
In order to mitigate these challenges and to catalyze the adoption of cloud
computing within the federal government, the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy
was released on February 8, 2011.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the General
Services Administration (GSA) have key roles in the implementation of this
“Cloud First” strategy. NIST has developed a number of Special Publications that
provide definitions, architectural standards, and roadmaps for cloud computing.
GSA has developed the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
(FedRAMP) to define security, auditing, continuous monitoring, and other opera-
tional requirements for federal agency use of cloud computing.
I admire the groundbreaking initiatives that have been spearheaded by NIST
and GSA. And yet, these efforts have created a new landscape with its own set of
twists and turns that must be navigated by both federal agencies and CSPs wish-
ing to serve the federal marketplace. What has been missing so far is a definitive
reference guide that will allow anyone with a stake in federal IT to quickly
ascend the learning curve associated with the goals, objectives, implementation,
and operational aspects of the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. Mr. Metheny’s
book fills this gap by providing a comprehensive view of how and where cloud
computing fits in the federal government and how the critical components of the
Cloud First strategy will work together in a complementary fashion.
I believe that this book will prove to be an invaluable resource to anyone who
needs to successfully navigate the brave new world of federal cloud computing.
CSPs will gain an understanding of the security and operational requirements
that must be met in order to provide cloud-based services to federal agencies.
Cloud auditors who wish to provide services to federal agencies or CSPs will

Organization (3PAO). Federal agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief
Technology Officers (CTOs), and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs)
will benefit from greater clarity regarding the impacts that the move to cloud
computing will have on their existing IT strategy and operations.
The Cloud First strategy is a critical component of broader efforts that are
underway to transform federal IT in the 21st century. This book will provide
excellent guidance to everyone who wishes to undertake that journey.

Foreword by William Corrington

Foreword by Jim Reavis
Cloud computing is an epochal change in the use of technology by mankind.
Broadly considered, it represents the transition toward the use of computer as a
utility, with profound implications. Just as when nations became electrified, the
dawn of new industries, reorganization of societies, and other unexpected outcomes
are surely at our doorstep. Access to supercomputer capabilities, previously only
available to small groups of people with millions of dollars, is now available to all.
The ability for individuals, small businesses, and large enterprises to have “on
demand” access to a virtually unlimited supply of computer power and storage
challenges our ability to innovate. From discovering new drugs to unlocking the
mysteries of the universe to finding better solutions for the human condition, we
are only limited by our imagination.
Governments are no different than any other organization in their propensity
to be impacted by, and leverage the cloud. The very largest problems that govern-
ments face have the potential to be solved, in large part, by the cloud. Cloud will
also force government agencies to be more transparent and collaborative with the
information that forms the backbone of their services. At the same time, a rush to
adopt cloud computing without a sound understanding of its potential and risks
could prove a devastating setback. This book, “Federal Cloud Computing: The
Definitive Guide for Cloud Service Providers” is a timely addition to our shared
knowledge of what cloud computing is, the inherent risks, regulatory require-
ments, and the ecosystem of standards and best practices.
Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is a not-for-profit organization that is the lead-
ing global force in building trust within cloud computing. We congratulate author
and CSA member Matthew Metheny for his excellent contribution to the topic of
cloud computing within the US federal government. We feel that this book is a
must-read for anyone interested in information technology within our government.
Both government consumers and providers must understand the regulatory
requirements, the processes for making cloud services available, and best prac-
tices to mitigate risks and operate cloud systems securely.
Cloud computing is not only our future, but is also here today. Whatever role
you play in this topic, you have a mandate to find strategies to securely adopt
cloud in an agile manner. “Federal Cloud Computing: The Definitive Guide for
Cloud Service Providers” is an excellent coach to help define those strategies.
Best,
Jim Reavis
Chief Executive Officer, Cloud Security Alliance

INTRODUCTION
In February 2011, the former US Chief Information Officer (CIO), Vivek Kundra,
published the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, herein referred to as the “Cloud
Strategy.”1
The Cloud Strategy, as illustrated in Fig. 1.1, was one of six major compo-
nents of the 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information
Technology Management, the US CIO’s roadmap to the cloud. The roadmap
focused on shifting to cloud services, which can be deployed rapidly, and shared
solutions that will result in substantial cost savings, allowing federal agencies to
optimize spending and to reinvest in their most critical mission needs [1].
In
the
25 Point
Implementation
Plan
to
Reform Federal
Information
Technology Management, the Cloud First policy, also referred to as “Cloud
First,” requires federal agencies to implement cloud-based solutions whenever a
secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud option existed. The publication of the
Cloud Strategy facilitates the implementation of the Cloud First policy by initiat-
ing a program2 to “accelerate the safe and secure adoption of cloud computing
across the government” [2]. Additionally, the Cloud Strategy directs the National

Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to lead the standards development3
related to security, interoperability, and portability, to reduce barriers to cloud
adoption by federal agencies.
In the Cloud Strategy, the US federal government’s strategic approach for the
adoption of cloud computing technologies was described, including the potential
benefits, considerations, and trade-offs [2]. The strategy also provided a decision
framework4 for federal agencies to use in outlining their plan for using cloud
computing services. The migration plans and government-wide initiatives help
identify candidate cloud services to improve their efficient use of IT investments
to support their missions by leveraging shared infrastructures and economies of
scale. The decision framework focused on changing how federal agencies
approached the acquisition and use of IT5 and how they could effectively inte-
grate cloud services into their IT portfolio.

4From Powner, D. “Progress Made but Future of Cloud Computing Efforts Should Be Better
Planned.” Washington, DC: US Government Accountability Office; 2012. “The decision frame-
work, among other things, identifies several key areas for determining the readiness for moving to
a cloud environment, including the ability of the cloud service provider to address government
security requirements.”
5From Kundra, V. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the
President, Office of Management and Budget; 2011. “Organizations that previously thought of IT
as an investment in locally owned and operated applications, servers, and networks will now need
to think of IT in terms of services, commoditized computing resources, agile provisioning tools, and
their enabling effect for American citizens.”

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

The Cloud Strategy also established a set of basic principles and guidelines
through which decision-makers within federal agencies could use it to accelerate
their secure adoption of cloud services. Through the strategy, federal agencies
were empowered with the responsibility for making their own decision on “what”
and “how” to migrate to the cloud in support of the government-wide Cloud First
policy. The Cloud First policy creates the momentum for federal agencies to pro-
actively adopt cloud computing services by requiring them to begin with the
selection of three6 “cloud-ready”7 IT services.8 To assist federal agencies in
acquiring (procuring)9 cloud services to meet the Cloud First policy, the US
General Services Administration (GSA) through the Cloud Computing Services
(CCS) Program Management Office (PMO), established contracts that federal
agencies could leverage for purchasing commodity cloud services. As depicted in
Fig. 1.2, Email as a Server (EaaS)10 a commodity cloud service, was one of the
most common types of IT systems migrated to the cloud.
In the section, the Decision Framework for Cloud Migration, a three-step
framework described the foundational elements that were identified as being
necessary for building a successful cloud migration plan.11 In addition, the
Cloud First policy gave federal agencies the opportunity to exercise their migra-
tion plans12 and develop and share “lessons learned” from their experiences.

content/uploads/downloads/2012/09/IT_Reform_Agency_Cloud_Migrations_FINAL.pdf
7Cloud readiness was one dimension for making risk-based decisions when determining which IT
service to migrate to the cloud. Readiness included factors such as security, service characteristics,
market characteristics, network infrastructure, application, and data readiness, government readi-
ness, and technology lifecycle.
8From Powner, D. Progress Made but Future of Cloud Computing Efforts Should Be Better
Planned. Washington, DC: US Government Accountability Office; 2012. “To accelerate the shift,
OMB required agencies, by February 2011, to identify three IT services to be migrated to a cloud
solution and develop a plan for each of the three services, migrate one of the services to a cloud-
based solution by December 2011, and migrate the remaining services by June 2012.”

Washington, DC: US General Services Administration (GSA) [cited August 27, 2012]. Available
from: https://www.acquisition.gov/?q 5 /browse/far/2. “‘Acquisition’ means the acquiring by con-
tract with appropriated funds of supplies or services (including construction) by and for the use of
the Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the supplies or services are already in
existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated. Acquisition begins at the
point when agency needs are established and includes the description of requirements to satisfy
agency needs, solicitation and selection of sources, award of contracts, contract financing, contract
performance, contract administration, and those technical and management functions directly
related to the process of fulfilling agency needs by contract.”

11From Kundra, V. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the
President, Office of Management and Budget; 2011. “Each migration plan includes major mile-
stones, execution risks, adoption targets, resource requirements, and retirement plans for legacy
services after the cloud service is online.”
12From Kundra, V. 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology
Management. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and
Budget; 2010. “The three-party strategy on cloud computing technology will evolve around using
commercial cloud technologies where feasible, launching government clouds, and utilizing regional
clouds with state and local government where appropriate.”

Introduction

The Cloud First policy also established the requirement for a program13 to be
developed that would encourage Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to meet federal
security and privacy requirements through the development of “government-
ready” (or FedRAMP compliant14) cloud services.15
The federal government has started the shift, from a traditional, asset-based
model focused on acquiring IT, to a service (or utility16)-based model, focused on
FIGURE 1.2
Total number of systems migrating to the cloud by type.

in Chapter 8, FedRAMP Primer, and Chapter 9, The FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security
Requirements.
14FedRAMP Compliant Systems. Available from: http://www.fedramp.gov/marketplace/compliant-
systems/.
15“Government-ready” cloud services refer to those that can satisfy a broad range of federal secu-
rity and privacy requirements to include statutory compliance, data security, protection of privacy-
related information, integrity, access controls, and governance and security management.
16Federal CIO Council and Chief Acquisition Officers Council. Creating effective cloud computing
contracts for the federal government. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President, Office of
Management and Budget; 2012. “Cloud computing presents the Federal Government with an
opportunity to transform its IT portfolio by giving agencies the ability to purchase a broad range
of IT services in a utility-based model. This allows agencies to refocus their efforts on IT opera-
tional expenditures and only pay for IT services consumed instead of buying IT with a focus on
capacity. Procuring IT services in a cloud computing model can help the Federal Government to
increase operational efficiencies, resource utilization, and innovation across its IT portfolio, deliv-
ering a higher return on our investments to the American taxpayer.”

consuming IT services. Cloud computing was not only a change in the technology
used by federal agencies, but also a cultural change.17 The “shift” towards cloud
services required federal agencies to change the people and processes that are
needed for procuring and provisioning cloud services. Cloud computing places an
increased importance on how technology is planned, selected, and integrated.18
The new service-based approach to IT required federal agencies to learn how to
manage services rather than assets. To effectively provision cloud services so that
there can be an achieved optimization of resources, federal agencies had to link
the benefits of cloud computing to their IT strategic plans.19 In addition, federal
agencies also had to establish new IT governance processes and practices to
ensure the adoption of secure cloud services adhered to the federal information
security and privacy requirements.
NOTE
Importance of Federal IT Strategic Planning in the Adoption of Cloud Computing
Government-wide IT strategic planning for information and IT management has been highlighted
as a systematic challenge almost since federal agencies began using IT. As early as 1960,20 the
US General Accounting Office (GAO)21 “ . . . call(ed) attention to the need for more positive
central planning of a long-range nature within the executive branch of the government to promote
the maximum degree of efficiency, economy, and effectiveness in the administration and
management of costly automatic data processing facilities” [3].
However, it was not until 198022 that the management of federal IT authority was centralized
within the federal government. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was given
government-wide responsibility to “oversee the use of information resources to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of governmental operations to serve agency missions” [4]. Federal
agencies were also required to designate a senior agency official (also known as the Agency CIO)
to be responsible for information resource management (IRM)23 at the department and agency
level. As the government-wide IRM activities evolved, Agency CIOs were also given additional

responsibilities in developing “strategic plans24 for all [departmental and agency] information and
information technology management functions” [5].
IT Strategic Plans25 play an important role in the adoption of cloud computing specifically
when planning the expected improvements in productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. Agency
CIOs will need to be more effective in aligning IT Strategic Plans with Agency Strategic Plans26
that enable the development and monitoring of performance metrics used to evaluate the business
value of cloud services. Therefore, the IT strategic planning process used by Agency CIOs will
need to emphasize the establishment of criteria that are more focused on objectively and
quantitatively measuring the benefits of the investment of cloud computing technologies across
the department and agency.
A HISTORICAL VIEW OF FEDERAL IT
In the Cloud Strategy, the federal IT environment was characterized as having
“low asset utilization, a fragmented demand for resources, duplicative systems,
environments which are difficult to manage, and long procurement lead times”
[2]. This characterization was the result of an accumulation of issues stemming
from years of mismanagement and the overcapitalization of IT.
In this section, we will focus on introducing several key historical points
within the federal government where the adoption of IT produced trends that led
to the growth in the federal IT budget. As illustrated in Fig. 1.3, a high-level
timeline is provided that depicts how the federal government’s IT budget and
portfolio changed with the transition to newer technologies.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

Our review will begin with mainframe computing (a highly centralized envi-
ronment) and end with the federal government’s transition to mobility (a highly
decentralized environment). For completeness, the review will also include a brief
discussion of the evolution of federal IT laws and policies developed over time to
manage IT related issues across the federal government such as program manage-
ment, acquisition, governance, privacy, and information security.
THE EARLY YEARS AND THE MAINFRAME ERA
The origins of modern computing27 can be directly linked to the federal govern-
ment. As the first significant28 user of computers, the federal government conse-
quently became one of the primary sources for most of the funding for the
innovation and research in computing technology. In the early years, computers
were very expensive, slow, inefficient, and took up a sizeable footprint,29 making
them impractical for use outside of the US government or research facilities.
Despite limitations, the US government continued to finance the development and
advancement of computer technologies. Originally, computers were only used for

military applications.30 However, this initial investment would serve to establish
the beginnings of an industry that would shape how the federal government would
use and operate computers today.
The first digital computers31 used by the federal government before the 1950s
were primarily used for scientific and defense purposes,32 although from the late
1940s to early 1950s the federal government’s interest began to change their
focus on using computers to address broader business challenges. In 1951, the
emergence of the UNIVersal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC) I33 created oppor-
tunities to use computers for applications outside of the US Department of
Defense (DoD). The UNIVAC became the first business computer purchased by
the Bureau of the Census34 to be used for the population and economic censuses.
During the remainder of the 1950s, several other civilian federal agencies also
began to acquire35 and use mainframes to supplement and support mission-
specific operations. Federal agencies saw these computers as a useful tool for
improving the productivity of more resource-intensive business support functions.
For example, mainframes were used to more efficiently and accurately calculate
tax returns (Internal Revenue Service), to calculate social security benefits
(Social Security Administration), and to generate labor statistics (US Department
of Labor).
The federal government’s acquisition activity for computers began to increase
significantly as the shift changed from using mainframes for basic business sup-
port functions to more complex mission-specific applications.36 As a result, the
federal government increased its purchasing of computers from 531 computers (or
$464 million) in 1960 to over 5277 computers (or an estimated $4 to $6 billion37

in capital expenditures) in 1970 [6]. The significant increase in the computer
inventory was primarily the result of federal agencies having the purchasing
power to procure resources needed to support their own individual needs and
requirements.
As the federal government’s mainframe inventory grew, federal agencies began
to face challenges associated with vendor and technology lock-in.38 As was
customary in industry pricing practices at that time, software and engineering sup-
port services were bundled with the hardware [6]. This bundling resulted in federal
agencies being locked into their mainframe vendors, making the migration between
technologies a challenge because the manufacturer had full control over the entire
stack, from the proprietary mainframe hardware platform to the software applica-
tions. In the 1980s, after the pricing practices began to change as major mainframe
manufacturers started to unbundle the hardware, software, and engineering support
services, the federal government was faced with a limited number of companies
in the mainframe market.39 This made it even more difficult for federal agencies
to modernize their legacy applications.40
SHIFTING TO MINICOMPUTER
The advancement in hardware technology introduced the integrated circuit and
the market evolved to midsized computers. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the
federal government also began to shift away from using mainframes and began
acquiring minicomputers. For the federal government, minicomputers provided a
more efficient improvement in central processing and “time sharing” capabilities
offering a much lower cost and size, thereby enabling them to be more broadly
available across the federal government. By 1974, as illustrated in Fig. 1.3, more
than 50% of the computers in the federal government cost less than $50,000 and
the inventory exceeded 8600. Fig. 1.4.
Minicomputers offered the federal government greater opportunities to use
technology to increase productivity through the use of automation to lower eco-
nomic costs in areas where repetitive activities were being performed manually.
As an example, minicomputers were used by the National Weather Service to
automate forecast offices [7], the Internal Revenue Service for electronically

DECENTRALIZATION: THE MICROCOMPUTER
(“PERSONAL COMPUTER”)
By the mid-1970s, the emergence of the microcomputer decentralized computing
and empowered end-users within the federal government. The significantly lower
cost gave federal agencies the ability to extend microcomputers to a broader
workforce with hopes of improving productivity across the federal government.
For example, in 1983, the US GSA began opening Office of Technology Plus
(OTP) stores (“GSA microcomputer stores”) to make it easier for federal agencies
to procure microcomputers by streamlining the buying process.
Microcomputer adoption continued to gain significant momentum in the
mid-1980s. By 1986, the federal government had amassed the largest inventory
of computer equipment in the world, with a cumulative IT budget of over
$60 billion between fiscal years (FY) 1982 and 1986.41 As illustrated in Fig. 1.5,

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

the government-wide microcomputer inventory increased from 2307 in 1980 to
99,087 in 1985.
The accelerated growth in the IT inventory was also challenged with an under-
developed IRM practice42 that began to impact the overall value and performance
of the federal government’s return on its IT investment. The federal government
saw impacts in areas such as the efficiency in delivering citizen services; main-
taining the security and privacy of information stored in computerized form; and
the quality of government IT management [3].
TRANSITIONING TO MOBILITY
Fastforwarding to today, the federal government operates in a more complex
world that includes a mix of technologies. The emergence of different, even
smaller types of platforms (i.e., smartphone, phablet, and tablet computers) and
digital services offers the federal government new opportunities to improve its

efficiency, while at the same time it faces the challenge of ensuring the security
and privacy of vast amounts of digital information. With a broad array of mobile
devices available, the federal government has started to embrace the investment43
in mobility. The expansive adoption of technologies that enable mobility required
the federal government to confront potential new challenges relating to the man-
agement of these different devices, the supporting infrastructures, and the soft-
ware applications. In addition, federal agencies are learning to manage the
continued growth in mobile applications44 and services45 to optimize the efficient
use of these technologies.
Many federal agencies have already become accustomed to using mobile com-
puting devices (e.g., laptops) through their experience in teleworking.46 Federal
agencies are also continuing to explore opportunities that would maximize the
benefits gained through the use of other mobile computing devices to enable them
to operate more cost-effectively and efficiently. Therefore, as federal agencies
make the transition to be more mobile47 and increase their usage of mobile com-
puting devices, they will be required to be more proficient at both managing and
securing48 different types of devices. This also means that federal agencies will
need to learn how to select, provision, and manage secure cloud services that will
be leveraged as more information is moved into digital services,49 so they can be
accessed by endpoint devices anytime, anywhere.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL IT POLICY
In the previous section, we briefly explored the history of IT adoption within the
federal government from mainframes to mobility. In this section, the focus will
include highlights of key federal IT laws and policies. Many of the laws and IT
policies were developed to govern the general practices for using IT within the
federal government; others addressed more specific topics such as security and
privacy. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 provide a chronological timeline of how the current
IT policy framework evolved over time to address government-wide oversight
and the management of IT-related issues and challenges. However, the policy
framework established by Congress and the executive branch to control, oversee,
and encourage the effective management and efficient use of IT was overtaken by
the rapid pace at which new technology applications, issues, and opportunities
were being generated or were not envisioned at the time of enactment or develop-
ment of the policies [3].
The early adoption of IT was a significantly small portion of the annual bud-
get in the 1960s. Therefore, purchasing power was performed in an isolated,
decentralized manner, where each federal agency was given the flexibility to
make its own buying decisions, including determining the types of technologies
that were needed to meet its requirements. It was not until the mid-1960s that
Congress took actions to improve the efficiency and effective use of IT across the
federal government.
The enactment of the Brooks Act of 196550 was the first significant legislation
focusing specifically on federal IT issues by establishing an oversight and man-
agement structure. The Brooks Act51 outlined the major roles and responsibilities
for the government-wide management of IT, which mostly operate under the
same functions today (with an exception () noted):
•
The US GSA was given the authority and responsibility over the purchase,
lease, maintenance, operation, and utilization of ADP equipment;
•
OMB was given the fiscal and policy control; and
•
The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Bureau of Standards (NBS),
now known as the NIST, was directed with setting technical standards and
guidelines.
The Brooks Act was established to reform federal IT by addressing three main
issues: (1) competitiveness and “best value” through centralized government pur-
chasing; (2) acquisition and IT management; and (3) common computing stan-
dards that would enable federal agencies to share information. In 1996, the
enactment of the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA) of
1996 (now known as the ClingerCohen Act) repealed the Brooks Act, effec-
tively eliminating GSA’s role as the primary federal agency for setting policy and

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

also established in 199655 to provide a central focal point for coordinating issues
across the federal government and to make recommendations for IT management
policies. Finally, in December 2014, the Federal Information Technology
Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) was enacted within the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The FITARA not only addressed IT
reform through government-wide programs and initiatives, but also enhanced the
authorities and responsibilities of the CIO for covered federal agencies, by
requiring their involvement in the planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution process related to IT.
Today, a combination of federal laws and government-wide policies provide
the foundation for the federal IT policy framework used to manage and control IT
issues within the federal government. The IT policy framework consists primarily
of four main sources:
1. Federal statutes, written and enacted by Congress to address major IT issues;
2. Government-wide executive directives and mandates issued by the OMB to
guide implementation of federal statutes;
3. Department or agency IT-level policies that address department or agency-
specific needs and requirements; and
4. IT policies that reflect the requirements of a specific community of interest
(COI).56
Through this policy framework the government-wide governance manages IT-
related issues such as information security, capital planning and investment manage-
ment, IT strategic planning, enterprise architecture, privacy, records management
and retention, and information use (e.g., dissemination, collection, and disclosure).
CLOUD COMPUTING: DRIVERS IN FEDERAL
IT TRANSFORMATION
The federal IT environment is undergoing a transformation. As discussed previ-
ously, the Cloud Strategy set forth the strategic direction for approaching the
adoption of cloud services. However, for this cloud transformation to be
successful and long-lasting, cultural changes57 will need to occur. The cultural

E-Government Act of 2002. Available from: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1996-07-19/pdf/96-
18555.pdf.
56For example, the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) establishes policies and direc-
tives for the National Security Community (https://www.cnss.gov/cnss/).
57Figliola, P., Fischer, E. Overview and Issues for Implementation of the Federal Cloud Computing
Initiative: Implications for Federal Information Technology Reform Management. Washington: The
Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service (CRS) Office. “. . . there are challenges fac-
ing agencies as they make this shift. For example, some agency CIOs have stated that in spite of
the stated security advantages of cloud computing, they are, in fact, concerned about moving their
data from their data centers, which they manage and control, to outsourced cloud services. This
and other concerns must be addressed to build an agency culture that trusts the cloud.”
23
Cloud Computing: Drivers in Federal IT Transformation

changes will need to focus on overcoming potential challenges of cloud adop-
tion.58 Solutions need to be established and embraced that address security and
privacy concerns, and other challenges impeding59 the realization of the benefits
of cloud computing. The institution of the federal government’s culture toward IT
needs to be oriented to consuming IT as a service, which requires moving data
and other resources to be housed off-site and placed under the control of the
CSPs (commercial or federal).
Through a continued and close collaborative partnership between federal
agencies and industry, the investment in transitioning individual federal agency
business processes to cloud services will serve as an accelerator in the transforma-
tional drivers to improve federal IT. In addition to a change in mindset, Agency
CIOs responsible for developing IT strategic plans need to be cultivated to think
of cloud services as increasing the efficiency and effectiveness that enable them to
address their strategic objectives, goals, and performance measures.
WARNING
One can easily justify how cloud services, if appropriately planned and integrated, could present
potential benefits for cost-savings and improve federal IT by maximizing efficiency, improving
agility, and enabling innovation. Through the right mixture of cloud computing services, the federal
government’s IT investment portfolios can achieve better optimization. However, the adoption of
cloud computing technologies will likely face ongoing impediments60 as “there continues to be a
need for a more thorough understanding of the cloud’s deployment models, unique security
implications, and data management challenges” [11]. Example impediments could include:
•
Cultural resistance.
•
Security and privacy concerns.
•
Network access, availability, and resiliency limitations.
•
Data portability and standardization.
•
Liability and regulations.
Therefore, federal agencies will continue to carefully navigate these challenges to ensure that
there is a limited impact to their mission and business.

Initiative: Implications for Federal Information Technology Reform Management. Washington: The
Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service (CRS) Office. “In its 2014 study, GSA found
five challenges in implementing cloud services. Two, meeting federal security requirements and
overcoming cultural barriers within agencies, remained from the 2012 study, and three new chal-
lenges also emerged: meeting new network infrastructure requirements; having appropriate exper-
tise for acquisition processes; and funding for implementation.”

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

DRIVERS FOR ADOPTION
Before proceeding with a discussion of the potential benefits offered to the fed-
eral government through the use of cloud computing, it is essential that we gain
some basic understanding of some of the possible drivers61 for cloud adoption.
As previously highlighted, the Cloud Strategy characterized the federal govern-
ment’s IT environment as: low asset utilization, fragmented demand, and dupli-
cative systems, environments that are difficult to manage, and long procurement
lead times [2]. This characterization was largely the result of the way the federal
government has acquired and operated IT over the years in independent silos.62
“Federal IT change efforts are typically managed in isolation from business
operations, so those working on long-term solutions are too often not concerned
with, or even aware of, the evolution of day-to-day business considerations”
[12]. These silos have led to the continued decentralization of the federal IT
environment, mostly because the federal agencies have developed overlapping,
duplicative, and, in many instances, fragmented programs that are not always
shared across the federal government or community boundaries. However, these
are not necessarily new issues. The scope of federal IT may have changed (i.e.,
size and complexity of programs, services, and systems), but the lack of strate-
gic alignment and functional integration63 between federal agencies has existed
long before the Cloud Strategy. This misalignment has led to expensive and
overly redundant development and maintenance costs. Across the federal gov-
ernment, multiple instances of similar shared services64 have been developed,
IT modernization efforts have been independently executed, and information
security programs have been operated with little or no intra- and inter-agency
coordination.

Computing Initiative: Implications for Federal Information Technology Reform Management.

services, which requires a meta-context and standards to be successful.”
64From VanRoekel, S. Federal Information Technology Shared Services Strategy. Washington, DC:
Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget; 2012. “The Federal
Information Technology Shared Services Strategy provides organizations in the Executive Branch
of the United States Federal Government (Federal Agencies) with policy guidance on the full range
and lifecycle of intra- and inter-agency information technology (IT) shared services, which enable
mission, administrative, and infrastructure-related IT functions.”

Cloud Computing: Drivers in Federal IT Transformation

NOTE
•
In May 2002, OMB identified 10 potentially redundant systems across the federal
government that related to the rule-making process.65 As a result, OMB focused on
“consolidating redundant IT systems relating to the President’s on-line rulemaking
initiative” [13].
•
The GAO reported in May 2004, “the duplicative and stovepiped nature of DOD’s [US
Department of Defense] systems environment is illustrated by the numerous systems it has in
the same functional areas. For example, DOD reported that it has over 200 inventory systems.
These systems are not integrated and thus have multiple points of data entry, which can result
in data integrity problems” [14].
•
In a March 2011 GAO report, “Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government
Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue,” the GAO “identified 81 areas for
consideration—34 areas of potential duplication, overlap, or fragmentation as well as 47
additional cost-saving and revenue-enhancing areas” [15]. Although not all specifically related
to the duplication of IT resources, since IT plays a critical role in supporting most government
programs and mission-specific operations, many areas of duplication would include the
underlying IT capabilities.
The duplication, coupled with the low utilization of IT resources, has contin-
ued to increase federal IT costs. Federal agencies (and even program manage-
ment offices) have worked independently to procure new hardware to satisfy
their need for additional capacity, rather than optimizing the existing IT
resources, either across an agency or between multiple agencies (for multiagency
programs). As an example, in 2010, as an output of the initial findings of the
FDCCI,66 average server utilization rates were noted as low as 7% [16]. The
absence of an effective IT management structure within the federal government
has led to this underutilization of computing and storage resources. In the course
of the initial phases of the FDCCI project, metrics similar to those included
in Fig. 1.6 were established to assist federal agencies in making more informed
IT management decisions for improving utilization within their consolidation
plans.67

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

NOTE
On January 14, 2010, the White House held “The Forum on Modernizing Government” where the
forum noted the following conclusion:
The Federal Government has difficulty managing large-scale technology efforts. The Forum
made it clear that there are best practices in industry for the design and ongoing review of
these types of technology efforts that increase their likelihood of success. By comparison to
these industry best practices, most Federal Government IT projects are too large and not
sufficiently integrated into business unit operations. Multi-year Federal IT efforts are
typically driven by technology managers—who often turn over during the life of the project—
rather than agency business leaders. Agency business leaders are not held accountable for
project success, and in turn do not adequately invest in IT project management. As a result, in
comparison to industry best practices, Federal IT projects are too often marked by milestones
spaced too far apart and deliverables that fail to deliver tangible end-user value. [17]
Another potential driver that is related to adoption of cloud computing includes
issues associated with the IT acquisition process. Federal IT acquisition has been
stagnant and largely unchanged for years. For example, in 1995, the GAO con-
ducted a statistical analysis of the time taken to complete an IT acquisition, and
noted that the time can vary depending on the dollar value, procurement type, and
whether a bid protest was filed [18]. These same challenges still exist today.
The continued delays in streamlining the acquisition process have limited the
potential benefits in the investment of IT. However, streamlining the acquisition
process is not enough. Federal agencies will need to make improvements in their
federal IT management practices to learn how to effectively leverage the cost-
savings provided by technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing and
make changes to their practices to accommodate acquiring IT as a service.68

nation with the Federal Cloud Compliance Committee published the best practices to assist federal
agencies in acquiring cloud services. Available from: https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/down-

Cloud Computing: Drivers in Federal IT Transformation

NOTE
It is important to note, the challenges within the federal IT were not created overnight. GAO, OMB,
and other organizations within the federal government have repeatedly highlighted weaknesses in
required federal IT processes and controls to address IT reform challenges, and the ineffective
government-wide and federal agency-specific IT oversight and management. As early as 2000, the
GAO highlighted OMB’s role as being “responsible for providing direction on government-wide
information resources and technology management and overseeing agency activities in these areas,
including analyzing major agency information technology investments” [19]. Although not
limiting the governance over IT investments within each federal agency, a central focal point was
noted as lacking to serve as this catalyst, working in conjunction with other executive officials to
ensure that information resources and technology management issues were addressed within the
context of the government’s highest priorities and not in isolation from them [19].
CLOUD BENEFITS
The Cloud Strategy offered the following key benefits to improved operational
efficiency, agility, and innovation through the use of cloud computing.
•
Efficiency—better use of existing resources through a service-based model
with a focus on improving utilization and to use technologies that would
reduce duplicative services across the federal government.
•
Agility—ability to deliver service faster and provision new resources based on
the federal agencies’ prioritization. For example, existing services that require
long lead times to upgrade or increase/decrease capacity would receive high
priority over services that are easier to upgrade, not sensitive to demand
fluctuations, or unlikely to need upgrade in the longer term [1].
•
Innovation—more access to innovation delivered through private sector
services.
A summarization of the benefits provided in Table 1.3 describes how
different characteristics of the federal IT environment can be improved through
cloud adoption. Through these improvements, the Cloud Strategy suggested that
federal agencies could benefit because they could redirect their “focus on
mission-critical tasks instead of purchasing, configuring and maintaining redun-
dant infrastructure” [1].
The 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology
Management highlighted similar benefits offered through the adoption of cloud
computing, through a service-based model as:
•
Economical: Pay-as-you-go approach to IT offers a lower initial investment,
while allowing the ability to add investments as system usage increases [1].
•
Flexible: Fluctuations in user demand and capacity can be added or subtracted
without acquiring additional hardware and software [1].
•
Fast: Long procurement times can be eliminated, while also enabling access
to a continuously growing selection of services [1].
28
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

However, to achieve sustainable benefits, the federal government will require
more than just adopting new services and technologies. Federal stakeholders will
need to commit to long-term transformational change in both the federal IT envi-
ronment and culture.
Cloud computing reinvents the federal government’s IT business acquisition
model,69
from
capital
expenditures
(CAPEX)
to
operational
expenditures
(OPEX). With any significant change in business operations, there is an upfront
cost required to support IT transformation. Federal agencies will need to under-
stand that these costs may not be recaptured immediately, and will likely have to
wait months, if not years, before savings are fully realized. Therefore, the benefits
previously described will need to be weighed against the maturity of current fed-
eral IT processes and practices already established to determine if changes need

contracts for the federal government. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President, Office of
Management and Budget; 2012. “By moving from purchasing IT in a way that requires capital

services, unique requirements have arisen that Federal agencies need to address when contracting
with cloud service providers (CSPs).”

to be made. Federal agencies will need to ensure that the transformation benefits
match their expectation of improved operational efficiency, resource optimization
(e.g., data center real estate, compute, storage, etc.), and increased security
through the delivery of IT as a service, something that will require change in the
way the federal government plans for IT.
Improving efficiency
The transition to cloud services is more than a change in technology delivery
models. It is also a shift in the focus from a federal government driven by IT asset
ownership to service management. By exploiting the benefits of on-demand
resource provisioning, federal agencies can learn to better understand their capacity
requirements by scaling their usage, thereby improving overall utilization.
Compared to fragmented and duplicative IT environments created by the invest-
ment in heterogeneous infrastructures in data centers across the country and around
the world, the federal government can leverage cloud computing capability as
a means to enable them to efficiently consolidate, transitioning the total cost of
ownership (TCO) of data centers, and offering the ability to repurpose the savings
to support their mission and business.
Improving agility
Agility in cloud computing provides federal agencies with the capability to rapidly
provision/de-provision resources (e.g., compute, storage) as changes occur in their
business requirements, making them more responsive and provides an opportunity
to focus on identifying sources for improving their overall agency performance.70
Improving innovation
Federal agencies have operated in a mode that has focused on avoidance of risk,
rather than managing risk. This has largely kept the federal government from
innovating at a pace similar to the private sector. Cloud adoption will enable fed-
eral agencies to become more innovative through better service delivery by
leveraging existing cloud services and emerging technologies that would increase
their operational effectiveness.
DECISION FRAMEWORK FOR CLOUD MIGRATION
The Cloud Strategy presented a three-step structured framework. As depicted in
Table 1.4, federal agencies can use the tool for assisting them when considering
the migration to cloud services. As previously discussed, cloud transformation
requires a shift in mindset. Federal agencies have been cultured to manage assets

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

because it enables them to have more control over their IT infrastructure. The shift
in mindset to managing IT as a service will require federal agencies to rely more
on CSPs, a significant first challenge to overcome in cloud transformation.
Throughout the remainder of this section, we will briefly discuss each of the
steps in the decision framework to demonstrate how they can be applied to a
“Federal Agency” (a generic reference to a federal agency cloud service customer).71
SELECTING SERVICES TO MOVE TO THE CLOUD
First the “Federal Agency” needs to decide if it is ready to migrate to the cloud. In
addition to the “Federal Agency” readiness, the Cloud Strategy identified several
factors when performing a risk-based72 evaluation of the readiness of CSPs as a
preliminary activity to considering cloud services such as security requirements,
service characteristics, market characteristics, network infrastructure, application
and data, government readiness, and technology lifecycle [2]. After the “Federal
Agency” has decided that it is ready to migrate some of its services to the cloud,
the next important question is: “What services to move?” This determination
calls for a full understanding of its IT investment portfolio and risk tolerance,
among other things. Preliminary activities may include the “Federal Agency”

Cloud Computing Strategy. Available from: https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/swim/documen-
tation/media/cloud_computing/FAA%20Cloud%20Computing%20Strategy%20v1.0.pdf.

Resilience in Government Clouds that provides decision-making model for the identification of
cloud solutions that meet the organization requirements. Available from: http://www.enisa.europa.

31
Decision Framework for Cloud Migration

CIO in collaboration with other key stakeholders to establish a clear set of criteria
that will be used as a part of evaluating CSPs. Part of this process may include
“identifying security, privacy, or other requirements for cloud services to meet, as
a criterion for the selection of a cloud provider” [20].
Next, the “Federal Agency” can conduct a full evaluation of the current IT
portfolio for potential services that are candidates to be included in its cloud
adoption roadmap and plans. The services might be prioritized based on the
“expected values” and “cloud readiness.” Since the federal government tends to
operate with a predominately risk-adverse mindset, the “Federal Agency” may
need to develop additional metrics. These metrics could be used to measure the
expected value by the “Federal Agency,” and the readiness of both the “Federal
Agency” and CSPs (commercial or federal). By evaluating short- and long-term
benefits (i.e., efficiency, agility, and innovation) the “Federal Agency” can seek
to properly align its migration planning with its governance and risk management
functions that place an emphasis on identifying mitigations that would assist the
“Federal Agency” in minimizing potential risks during the migration process.
PROVISIONING CLOUD SERVICES EFFECTIVELY
The federal government has had a history of “IT outsourcing.” However, most IT
outsourcing has been conducted by a “single” federal agency or multiple federal
agencies through a joint program management office (PMO) using traditional pro-
curement methods to contract services from providers to build and host services,
applications, and information. In these types of outsourcing arrangements, the fed-
eral government mostly maintained control over IT assets and their information.
By purchasing IT “on-demand,” unique requirements may arise that federal agen-
cies will need to address when contracting with CSPs [21]. Therefore, provision-
ing cloud services will require a change in the “Federal Agency” acquisition
processes and practices. This new model of provisioning IT service will also
enable the “Federal Agency” to be more cost-effective by pooling together the
purchasing power through an aggregation of demand to the greatest extent possi-
ble before migrating services to the cloud [2].
Additionally, the Cloud Strategy outlined several other considerations [2] the
“Federal Agency” should consider to reduce the risk associated with migrating to
the cloud and to maximize efficiency such as:
•
Integration of the IT service into the IT portfolio and functions that support
business processes.
•
Effective implementation of contract provisions that ensure portability and
encourage competition (limit vendor lock-in); explicitly include service level
agreements (SLAs) for security, continuity of operations, and service quality
based on specific agency needs; and specific metrics that clearly state how
and when they will be collected.
•
Realizing the value through the appropriate use of cloud services through the
decommissioning and release of assets used to support legacy applications
and servers.
32
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy

MANAGING SERVICES RATHER THAN ASSETS
When the “Federal Agency” has successfully migrated to the cloud, differences
may exist in the relationship between the “Federal Agency” and the CSP, which
will require adopting new governance processes. The “Federal Agency” will need
to ensure that it can effectively manage SLAs based on the metrics defined previ-
ously as part of cloud service selection activity. “SLAs should clearly define how
performance is guaranteed (such as response time resolution/mitigation time,
availability, etc.) and require CSPs to monitor their service levels, provide timely
notification of a failure to meet the SLAs, and evidence that problems have been
resolved or mitigated” [21]. SLA monitoring will also require the “Federal
Agency” to actively evaluate the metrics to ensure that they are enforced and
usage charges are accurate. Since portability, interoperability, and security are
key requirements for cloud service selection, the “Federal Agency” can periodi-
cally re-evaluate the market to identify opportunities that maximize capabilities
offered by changes in technologies, new cloud services, and private-sector
innovations.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, a brief overview of the Cloud Strategy was presented to highlight
the key drivers for the federal government’s adoption of cloud computing. In
addition, the introduction provides CSPs with a basic understanding of how the
strategy may be used by federal agencies considering cloud services as an exten-
sion of their IT portfolio. We briefly reviewed the history of federal IT with the
purpose of understanding the potential challenges that may be a force behind the
cloud adoption. We also discussed the key drivers for federal IT transformation
and the expected benefits received through cloud computing. Lastly, a brief exam-
ination of the three-step decision framework offered insight into its application
for cloud migration.

Standards play a critical role for cloud adoption, both by the federal government,1
and the private sector. As we will discuss later in this chapter, the federal govern-
ment has a responsibility to ensure voluntary consensus standards2 are adopted
in lieu of government-unique standards.3 However, first it is important to obtain a
basic understanding of what is meant by “standard” and the relationship to the
federal government’s adoption of cloud computing. Standardization can be char-
acterized as the process by which new standards are developed or new products
are brought to market implementing standards. A standard (or more specifically a

tions.5 In Table 2.1, the generally accepted definitions are provided for what con-
stitutes a standard for use by the federal government.
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy identified the importance of standards
development to ensure that the federal government’s adoption and effective use of
cloud computing and related technologies is supported by broad standardization.
For federal agencies to leverage the capabilities and achieve the benefits offered by
cloud computing, as described in Chapter 1, the development of standards focus on
three major areas6: interoperability,7portability,8 and security.9 For example, stan-
dards “ensure clouds have an interoperable platform so that services provided by
different providers can work together, regardless of whether they are provided using
public, private, community, or a hybrid delivery model” [3].

CHAPTER 2 Cloud computing standards

NOTE
Although there is no industry standard for the definition of cloud computing, the following
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST10) [4] Cloud Computing definition has
been widely accepted as the standard:
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access
to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,
applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential
characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.
Essential Characteristics
•
On-demand self-service—a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such
as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human
interaction with each service provider.
•
Broad network access—capabilities are available over the network and accessed through
standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms
(e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
•
Resource pooling—the provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
using a multitenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned
and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in
that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the
provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction
(e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing,
memory, and network bandwidth.
•
Rapid elasticity—capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases
automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the
consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be
appropriated in any quantity at any time.
•
Measured service—cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by
leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service
(e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be
monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and
consumer of the utilized service.
Service Models
•
Software as a Service (SaaS)—the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s
applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various
client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based
email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual
application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application
configuration settings.

Introduction

NOTE (CONTINUED)
•
Platform as a Service (PaaS)—the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the
cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming
languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration
settings for the application-hosting environment.
•
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—the capability provided to the consumer is to provision
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the
consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems
and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly
limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
Deployment Models
•
Private cloud—the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single
organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed,
and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist
on or off premises.
•
Community cloud—the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific
community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security
requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and
operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some
combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
•
Public cloud—the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It
may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization,
or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
•
Hybrid cloud—the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud
infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound
together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability
(e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).
To support the interests of the federal government, NIST was charged with pro-
viding technical guidance and support in the standards development efforts relating
to cloud computing. The NIST Cloud Computing Program,11 through the Cloud
Computing Standards Roadmap Working Group,12 developed the Cloud Computing
Standards Roadmap13 that focused on bolstering the federal government’s ability to
adopt cloud services. In addition, NIST was given the responsibility for directing
and managing the strategic and tactical programs to ensure standards that already

existed or are in development can be integrated into the US Government’s Cloud
Computing Technology Roadmap.14 For the roadmap to be successful, NIST’s par-
ticipation was important to ensure that standards development supported accelera-
tion by the private sector that would implement those new standards in products
and services that could be procured by federal agencies.
Cloud computing is supported by many existing and emerging standards.
Although not all of them were specifically developed with cloud computing in
mind, many of them do directly support cloud services delivery. NIST and many
leading industry groups and associations15 have focused on identifying the tech-
nology standards gaps for the development of cloud-specific standards, including
broad standardization. When a significant gap within standards exists, standards
organizations, industry groups, and the cloud communities are faced with the
challenge of coordinating their efforts to ensure interoperability between stan-
dards and to limit the impact associated with too many standards.16 Overlapping
and duplicative standards efforts attempting to solve the same problem may inad-
vertently cause competition for the “best” standard to fill the gaps. Therefore,
standards convergence is important to ensure that standards are developed to
address the need for compatibility.
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PRIMER
Standards development organizations (SDOs)17 typically have a process they fol-
low for developing standards. As an example, the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) follows a six-step process18 that includes: proposal,

Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap included a “high-level conceptualization of
ways in which IT standards are developed and methods by which standards-based
IT products, processes, and services are deployed” [1]. Although only exemplary,
the life cycle provides a good illustration of the relationship between the IT stan-
dards development process and the process by which IT standards are integrated,
tested, and deployed in products and services that would be procured from the
federal marketplace.19
The challenge faced with standardization using the conventional SDO-based
standards development process in cloud computing exist in the length of time from
standardization to product availability. The standards development process needs
to be as agile and align with the maturing cloud service product development
life cycle to address unique federal government requirements that support high
priority20 government-wide or federal agency projects. Therefore, the standards

development model need to be accelerated,21 while taking into consideration of the
need for a voluntary consensus-based process. This new standards development
model would reduce the technical uncertainty faced by federal agencies concerned
with interoperability, portability, and security when adopting cloud service during
the interim, while at the same time ensuring that Cloud Computing Standards are
formalized and broadly available within the marketplace.
The US standardization system22 is based on a set of globally accepted princi-
ples for standards development. Voluntary consensus is a critical part of this
standardization system. A consensus-based process ensures standards meet the
needs of both public and private sector23 stakeholders before being finalized.
The federal government’s adoption of standards needs to be consistent with the
objectives of the Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT)24 Committee. By leveraging
an “international” focused set of principles such as transparency,25 openness,26
and consensus,27 the federal government can ensure that standards development
increases the likelihood of standardization in cloud computing products and
services.

Standards Development Primer

TIP
Standards adoption is an evolutionary process. Throughout the process, standards grow in both
acceptance and maturity, and it could take years for standards to mature. Most standards can be
generally classified as one (or more) of the following types at some point within the standards
development lifecycle.28
•
Open standards are open to anyone to participate in developing and implementing
(e.g., royalty-free).
•
Proprietary specifications are privately developed and are usually licensed for
implementation. Sometimes, although not always, once they receive enough industry
acceptance, they evolve into de facto standards.
•
De facto standards are considered industry norms through broad adoption and “in practice”
application. They have gained acceptance and are therefore expected rather than required to be
part of a product roadmap.
•
De jure standards are formalized through a standards body, thereby making them widely
approved because of their formal acceptance.
As standards mature and broader market acceptance begins to see more partici-
pants, it is important for the federal government to ensure cloud-based products and
services are conforming to the standards and requirements for implementation.
Therefore, standardization requires using a process known as conformity assessment,
to demonstrate “whether directly or indirectly, that specified requirements relating
to a product, process, system, person, or body are fulfilled. Conformity assessment
includes sampling and testing, inspection, supplier’s declaration of conformity, certi-
fication, and management system assessment and registration. Conformity assess-
ment also includes accreditation of the competence of those activities” [12].
The conformity assessment process provides both the federal government and
industry with the confidence that a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has implemen-
ted standards that meet the interoperability, portability, and security requirements
necessary to maximize the benefit offered by cloud computing. It also provides a
framework for CSPs to use when assessing their own products and services
against standards, potentially making them more competitive within industry
based on federal agency requirements for specific standards.
CLOUD COMPUTING STANDARDIZATION DRIVERS
The key driver for the federal government in supporting the standardization
of cloud solutions is to address security,29 portability, and interoperability
28Sometimes standards maintain their status as either “de facto” or “de jure” throughout their entire
lifetime.
29From Federal CIO Council and Chief Acquisition Officers Council. Creating effective cloud com-
puting contracts for the federal government. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President,
Office of Management and Budget; 2012. “Agencies must clearly detail the requirements for CSPs
to maintain the security and integrity of data existing in a cloud environment.”

CHAPTER 2 Cloud computing standards

requirements. For example, without commonly implemented standards addressing
interoperability and portability, federal agencies may be required to make signifi-
cant changes to their existing software or adapt their code to work within a spe-
cific cloud service environment using proprietary Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs).30 This potentially could increase the cost of migrating between
CSPs, creating a scenario that may become a barrier for a particular federal
agency that has a concern about being locked into a specific cloud service.
Many standards used in cloud computing are a convergence of existing stan-
dards. As cloud computing technologies mature, consensus within the industry
will begin to establish new standards specifically developed for cloud environ-
ments. The NIST Standards Acceleration to Jumpstart Adoption of Cloud
Computing (SAJACC)31 initiative was established to support the acceleration of
adopting these new standards by developing tests that show the extent to which
specific use cases can be supported by cloud systems through a set of documented
and public cloud system specifications [5].
FEDERAL LAWS AND POLICY
The federal government is directly concerned with setting and implementing stan-
dards through legislation, regulation, or contractual obligations for sales to gov-
ernment purchasers [6]. In its roles, supporting standards development accelerates
the broader adoption of cloud computing within the federal government and also
assists federal agencies in satisfying their responsibility under federal laws and
policies. This responsibility requires them to use voluntary consensus standards,
where practical, in their procurement activities.
Trade Agreements Act (TAA)
The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA)32 governs trade agreements negotiated
with other countries. Under the TAA, federal agencies are prohibited from engag-
ing “in any standards-related activity that creates unnecessary obstacles to the
foreign commerce of the United States” [7] and are required to consider interna-
tional standards. However, the TAA also could prohibit data housed in cloud
computing servers and storage devices reside within the countries33 not covered
under the Act.34 NIST supports the implementation of the TAA, including

Cloud computing as defined by NIST is “a model for enabling ubiquitous,
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable com-
puting resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort
or service provider interaction” [9]. With different cloud deployment and ser-
vice models available (including derivatives classifications), standards develop-
ment is an essential part of ensuring the federal agencies’ adoption of cloud

computing technologies is not hindered by potential barriers such as poorly
defined, or a lack of market acceptance of, standards. These barriers limit fed-
eral agencies from maximizing their cost-savings through the use of cloud ser-
vices, impacting their ability to deliver results and produce opportunities for
value creation.
As cloud computing matures, open and proprietary standards will coexist
within the cloud computing ecosystem. As illustrated in Fig. 2.2, usage scenarios
driving Cloud Computing Standards development will be different at each of the
service layers (i.e., data portability at the Software as a Service layer and VM
portability at the Infrastructure as a Service layer).
The requirements for each of the usage scenarios will need to support
well-defined and documented standards or specifications to ensure the federal
government’s interoperability, portability, and security requirements can be
satisfied.
TIP
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy highlighted the need for federal agencies to consider the
market characteristic (i.e., the competitiveness and maturity) for selecting services as part of their
decision process for moving to the cloud. The strategy stated that “agencies should consider the
availability of technical standards for cloud interfaces which reduce the risk of vendor lock-in” [3].
It also highlighted the importance of considering, in addition to security, the interoperability
and portability requirements as an aspect to address in the development of contracts to procure
cloud services.
IDENTIFYING STANDARDS FOR FEDERAL CLOUD
COMPUTING ADOPTION
The NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture Working Group generated a
consensus conceptual reference model. The conceptual reference model, illus-
trated in Fig. 2.3, provides a “high-level” model to assist in understanding, dis-
cussing, categorizing, and comparing cloud services to communicate and analyze
security,38 interoperability,39 and portability40 candidate standards and reference
implementations [10].
38Examples include authentication and authorization, confidentiality, integrity, and identity and
access management.
39Examples include the interoperability of services through the service management (consumer
APIs) and functional interfaces.
40Examples include data and workload portability.

TIP
As discussed in the reference “Creating Effective Cloud Computing Contracts for the Federal
Government” jointly published by the Federal Chief Information Office (CIO) Council and Chief
Acquisition Officers (CAO) Council [11]:
When procuring cloud solutions, it is important for federal agencies to understand:
1. How vendor solutions and agency roles map to the NIST Reference Architecture41; and
2. The role of federal agencies in the use of Cloud Computing Standards.
Reference Architecture
The NIST Reference Architecture describes five major actors with their roles and responsibilities
using the newly developed Cloud Computing Taxonomy. The five major participating actors are:
(1) Cloud Consumer; (2) Cloud Provider; (3) Cloud Broker; (4) Cloud Auditor; and (5) Cloud
Carrier.
In order to fully delineate the roles and responsibilities of all parties in a cloud
computing contract, federal agencies should align all actors with the NIST Reference
Architecture.
Agency Roles in the Use of Cloud Computing Standards
There are several means by which federal agencies can ensure the availability of technically
sound and timely standards to support their missions.
1. Standards specification: In accordance with the OMB Circular A-119, Federal
Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in
Conformity Assessment Activities, federal agencies should specify relevant voluntary
consensus standards in their procurements. The NIST Standards.gov website includes
a useful list of questions that agencies should consider before selecting standards for
agency use.
2. Standards requirements: Federal agencies should contribute clear and comprehensive mission
requirements to help support the definition of performance-based Cloud Computing Standards
by the private sector.
In addition, the Conceptual Reference Model provides a useful tool for map-
ping and a common frame of reference for identifying the standards that will be
required to facilitate adoption. By understanding the underlying business or
technical use cases,42 specific emphasis can be placed on those areas where gaps in
standards exist based on the cross-cutting requirements. Federal agencies, as a
cloud computing actor,43 are the most likely sources for usage scenarios and for
identifying requirements. Federal agencies’ participation in the standards develop-
ment process helps in the acceleration of the development and use of Cloud
Computing Standards and standards-based products, processes, and services [11].

Identifying Standards for Federal Cloud Computing Adoption

STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS (SDOs) AND OTHER
COMMUNITY-DRIVEN ORGANIZATIONS
Standards development for cloud computing requires the active involvement of
multiple standards bodies. Standards bodies are standards setting organizations
that usually consist of stakeholders such as organizations or companies that pro-
duce technical standards to address the market’s needs for standardization.
Table 2.2 lists some of the international and national standards bodies involved in
developing Cloud Computing Standards.
STANDARDS INVENTORY
Standards for cloud computing will continue to evolve, mature, and gain accep-
tance. This chapter does not attempt to provide a comprehensive catalog of
standards supporting cloud computing, as harmonization of standards could
take many years. Instead, it attempts to address the importance for cloud stan-
dards to promote openness and flexibility of choice by the federal government,
while also supporting the minimum requirements of interoperability, portabil-
ity, and security. This requires a focus on continued development of cloud com-
puting use cases to anticipate where cloud technologies will be used, so that
standards organizations, industry groups, and associations can coordinate their
efforts to define existing standards, and identify where new standards will need
to be developed.

CHAPTER 2 Cloud computing standards

The US Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap44 required the
development of a Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap for prioritizing standards
developed to support the federal government’s interoperability, portability, and
security requirements. As part of the Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap devel-
opment, the NIST Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap Working Group con-
ducted a survey to identify existing industry standards, similar to those included in
Tables 2.32.5, related to service interoperability, service performance agree-
ments and monitoring, data and system portability, security, and accessibility.
The results included an inventory of standards that provides a starting point
for mapping to applicable business and technical use cases. As previously dis-
cussed, this mapping activity is an important part in determining standards gaps
and support prioritization with the standards community.

CHAPTER 2 Cloud computing standards

SUMMARY
This chapter provided an overview of the standards activities and the importance
of standards development to the adoption of cloud computing within the federal
government. By briefly reviewing the standards development process, we can
begin to characterize standards supporting cloud computing and their maturity
based on the evolutionary standards life cycle. We then discussed the federal leg-
islative and policy drivers that address the federal government’s role in supporting
standards activities and the drivers affecting cloud computing adoption. We con-
cluded our discussion by looking at the NIST Conceptual Reference Model
and how the reference architecture can be used to facilitate the identification of
standards that would meet specific usage scenarios.

Open Source Software and Federal Cloud Computing
INTRODUCTION
Open source software (OSS)1 and cloud computing are distinctly different
concepts that have independently grown in use, both in the public and private
sectors, but have each faced adoption challenges by federal agencies. Both OSS2
and cloud computing individually offer potential benefits for federal agencies
to improve their efficiency, agility, and innovation, by enabling them to be more
responsive to new or changing requirements in their missions and business
operations. OSS improves the way the federal government develops and also
distributes software3 and provides an opportunity to reduce costs through the

reuse of existing source code,4 whereas cloud computing improves the utilization
of resources and enables a faster service delivery.
In this chapter, issues faced by OSS in the federal government will be dis-
cussed, in addition to the relationship of the federal government’s adoption of
cloud computing technologies.5 However, this chapter does not present a differen-
tiation of OSS from proprietary software,6 rather focuses on highlighting the
importance of the federal government’s experience with OSS in the adoption of
cloud computing.
Over the years, the private sector7 has encouraged the federal government to
consider OSS by making a case that it offers an acceptable alternative to proprie-
tary commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. Regardless of the potential
cost-saving benefits of OSS, federal agencies have historically approached it with
cautious interest. Although, there are other potential issues in transitioning from
an existing proprietary software, beyond cost. These issues include, a limited
in-house skillset for OSS developers within the federal workforce, a lack of
knowledge regarding procurement or licensing, and the misinterpretation of acqui-
sition and security policies and guidance. Although some of the challenges and
concerns have limited or slowed a broader-scale adoption of OSS, federal
agencies have become more familiar with OSS and the marketplace expansion of
available products and services, having made considerations for OSS as a viable
alternative to enterprise-wide COTS software. This renewed shift to move toward
OSS is also being driven by initiatives such as the 18F8 and the US Digital
Service,9 and the publication of the guidance such as the Digital Services
Playbook, which urges federal agencies to “consider using open source, cloud
based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack” [1].

CHAPTER 3 A case for open source

NOTE
Example cases where OSS was identified as a viable option to support federal government
programs:
•
In May 2011, the US Department of Veterans Affair (VA) CIO stated to avoid costs, and to
find a way to involve the private sector in modernizing Veterans Integrated System
Technology Architecture (VistA; electronic medical records system), the VA turned to open
source [2]. In response, the VA launched the Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance
(OSEHRA) in August 2012 “as a central governing body of a new open source Electronic
Health Record (EHR) community” [3].
•
In January 2012, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched a new
website, the NASA Open Government Initiative,10 to expand the agency’s OSS development.
The NASA Open Government co-lead stated: “We believe tomorrow’s space and science
systems will be built in the open, and that code.nasa.gov will play a big part in getting us
there” [4].
Interoperability, portability, and security standards11 have already been identi-
fied12 as critical barriers for cloud adoption within the federal government. OSS
facilitates overcoming standards obstacles through the development and imple-
mentation of open standards.13 OSS communities support standards development
through the “shared” development and industry implementation of open stan-
dards.14 In some instances, the federal government’s experience with standards
development has enabled the acceptance and use of open standards-based, open
source technologies and platforms.

11Standards were discussed in detail in Chapter 2, Cloud Computing Standards.
12From Kundra, V. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the
President, Office of Management and Budget; 2011. Standards will be critical for the successful
adoption and delivery of cloud computing, both within the public sector and more broadly.
Standards are also critical to ensure clouds have an interoperable platform so that services pro-
vided by different providers can work together, regardless of whether they are provided using pub-
lic, private, community, or a hybrid delivery model.
13From the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB Memorandum 1621, Federal Source
Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open
Source Software. Washington, DC: Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and
Budget; 2016. “Regardless of the specific solution selected, all software procurements and
Government software development projects should consider utilizing open standards whenever
practicable in order to increase the interoperability of all Government software solutions. Open
standards enable software to be used by anyone at any time, and can spur innovation and growth
regardless of the technology used for implementation—be it proprietary, mixed source, or OSS in
nature.”
14Open standards, in general terms, is a technical specification that is developed openly (partici-
pation and publication) and is vendor neutral with limited cost (or free availability) to
implementers.

Introduction

TIP
OSS also enables agile software development15 where the federal agencies can more rapidly
deploy technologies and capabilities; however, for agile software development to be viable across
the government, supporting government-wide agile acquisition guidance needs to be established.
The TechFAR Handbook,16 consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),17 was
published to guide federal agencies by explicitly encouraging the use of agile software
development and procure development services of modern software development techniques used
in the private sector through modular contracting practices.18
Many modernization projects have identified the use of OSS as a more economical value for
the federal government. Through the use of smaller, agile procurements, federal agencies are
achieving a higher yield and greater return on investment (ROI) compared to slower, inefficient
long-term investments that use traditional procurement methods that tend to be outpaced by
private sector innovations due to lengthy development cycles. Additionally, federal agencies are
required to consider multiple factors when defining the overall business case19 for an Information
Technology (IT) investment.20 Some factors that must be considered as part of the IT investment
decision-making process21 includes the total cost of ownership (TCO) and lifecycle maintenance
costs, the costs associated with mitigating security risks, and the security and privacy of data [5].
OSS also requires transitioning to a subscription-based model, thereby reducing the burden for
federal agencies to invest in upfront costs, which lock them into capital expenses that may be
unrecoverable if the requirements change or a program is canceled or rescoped.

CHAPTER 3 A case for open source

OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
The federal government’s use of OSS has its beginning in the 1990s.22 During
this period, OSS was used primarily within the research and scientific community
where collaboration and information sharing was a cultural norm. However, it
was not until 2000 that federal agencies began to seriously consider the use of
OSS as a model for accelerating innovation within the federal government. As
illustrated in Fig. 3.1, the federal government has developed a list of OSS-related
studies, policies, and guidelines that have formed the basis for the policy frame-
work that has guided the adoption of OSS. This framework tackles critical issues
that have inhibited the federal government from attaining the full benefits offered
by OSS. Although gaps23 still exist in specific guidelines relating to the evalua-
tion, contribution, and sharing of OSS, the policy framework serves as a founda-
tion for guiding federal agencies in the use of OSS. In this section, we will
explore the policy framework with the objective of describing how the current
policy framework has led to the broader use of OSS across the federal govern-
ment, and more importantly how this framework has enabled the federal govern-
ment’s adoption of cloud computing by overcoming the challenges with
acquisition and security that will be discussed in detail in the next section.

Open Source Software and the Federal Government

The President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC),24
which examined OSS, was given the goal [6] of:
•
Charting a vision of how the federal government can support developing OSS;
•
Defining a policy framework;
•
Identifying policy, legal, and administrative barriers to the widespread
adoption of OSS; and
•
Identifying potential roles for public institutions in OSS economics model.
The PITAC published a report25 concluding that the use of the open source
development model (also known as the Bazaar model26) was a viable strategy for
producing high-quality software through a mixture of public, private, and
academic partnerships [7]. In addition, as presented in Table 3.1, the report also
Table 3.1 Advantages and Challenges Highlighted in the PITAC Report [6]
Advantages
• Potentially improved security because programmers have developed
access to source code that allows them to examine it for potential
embedded trap doors and/or Trojan horses.
• Increase in the number of programmers searching for software bugs
and developing fixes.
Challenges
• Limitation in the project management and funding models to support
“fiscal flexibility” for open source development.
• Lack of policies or guidance governing export control and national
security considerations.
• Potentially incompatible licensing agreements used within the open
source community may cause delays due to the lack of education of
how to use them.
• Poorly defined procurementa rules do not explicitly authorize competition
between open source alternatives and proprietary software.
• Lack of clear guidance regarding the decision-making authority and/or
responsibility of the federal agency to use OSS.
• Lack of a single repository for warehousing open source projects.
aFrom US Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology. Open Source Software in
Government: Challenges and Opportunities. Washington, DC: US Department of Homeland Security;
2013. “Incentivize government program offices and contractors to build collaborative communities and
to share code. Request for proposal developers should not presume that respondents have a
particular business model and should not impose unnecessary paperwork burdens. The government
should require sharing software and release software as OSS by default if it was developed with
public funds; this may require changes to contracting strategies.”

highlighted several advantages and challenges. Some of these key issues have
been at the forefront of the federal government’s adoption of OSS.
Over the years since the PITAC report, the federal government has gained sig-
nificant experience in both sponsoring and contributing to OSS projects. For
example, one of the most widely recognized contributions by the federal govern-
ment specifically related to security is the Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
project.27 The SELinux project focused on improving the Linux kernel through
the development of a reference implementation of the Flask security architec-
ture28 for flexible mandatory access control (MAC). In 2000, the National
Security Agency (NSA)29 made the SELinux available to the Linux community
under the terms of the GNU’s Not Unix (GNU) General Public License (GPL).30
NOTE
The Open Source Definition (OSD)31 had its beginning as free software32 in the early 1980s
during the free software movement33 starting with the GNU34 project35 that implemented the
GPL. Although the early uses of the terms “open source” and “free software” had been used
interchangeably during that period, it was not until 1998 that Netscape Communications
Corporation released36 their Netscape Navigator Web browser source code as Mozilla. At this
time, the distinction of the “open source”37 concept became more mainstream within the broader
commercial software industry. The Free Software Foundation38 and Open Source Initiative
(OSI)39 have similar goals, but there was a notable difference in respect to their philosophies40
and approved licenses.41

Open Source Software and the Federal Government

Starting in 2001, the MITRE Corporation, for the US Department of Defense
(DoD), published a report42 that built a business case for the DoD’s use of OSS.
The business case discussed both the benefits and risks for considering OSS. In
MITRE’s conclusion, OSS offered significant benefits to the federal government,
such as improved interoperability, increased support for open standards and qual-
ity, lower costs, and agility through reduced development time. In addition,
MITRE highlighted issues and risks, recommending any consideration of OSS
should be carefully reviewed.
Shortly after the MITRE report, the federal government began to establish spe-
cific policies and guidance to help clarify issues around OSS. The DoD Chief
Information Officer (CIO) published the Department’s first official DoD-wide
memorandum to reiterate existing policy and to provide clarifying guidance on
the acquisition, development, and the use of OSS within the DoD community [8].
Soon after the DoD policy, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estab-
lished a memorandum to provide government-wide policy43 regarding acquisi-
tion44 and licensing issues.
Since 2003, there were multiple misconceptions, specifically within the DoD,
regarding the use of OSS. Therefore, in 2007, the US Department of the Navy
(DON) CIO released a memorandum45 that clarified the classification of OSS and
directed the Department to identify areas where OSS can be used within the
DON’s IT portfolio. This was followed by another DoD-wide memorandum in
2009, which provided DoD-wide guidance and clarified the use and development
of OSS, including explaining the potential advantages of the DoD reducing the
development time for new software, anticipating threats, and response to contin-
ual changes in requirements [9].
In 2009, OMB released the Open Government Directive,46 which required fed-
eral agencies to develop and publish an Open Government Plan on their websites.

In 2009, a Presidential Memoranda was issued titled “Transparency and Open Government,” which
directed the OMB Director to issue an Open Government Directive to instruct federal agencies to take
specific action in implementing the Open Government Initiative.
66
CHAPTER 3 A case for open source

The Open Government Plan47 provided a description on how federal agencies would
improve transparency and integrate public participation and collaboration [10]. As
an example response to the directive support for openness, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), in furtherance of its Open Government
Plan, released the “open. NASA”48 site that was built completely using OSS, such as
the LAMP stack49 and the Wordpress content management system (CMS).
On May 23, 2012, the White House released the Digital Government Strategy
that complements50 other initiatives and established principles for transforming
the federal government. More specifically, the strategy outlined the need for a
“Shared Platform” approach. In this approach, the federal government would need
to leverage “sharing” of resources such as the “use of open source technologies
that enable more sharing of data and make content more accessible” [11].
The Second Open Government Action Plan established an action to develop
an OSS policy to improve access by federal agencies to custom software to “fuel
innovation, lower costs, and benefit the public” [12]. In August 2016, the White
House published the Federal Source Code Policy, which is consistent with the
“Shared Platform” approach in the Digital Government’s Strategy, by requiring
federal agencies make available custom code as OSS.51 Further, the policy also
made “custom-developed code available for Government-wide reuse and make
their code inventories discoverable at https://www.code.gov (‘Code.gov’)” [12].
In this section, we discussed key milestones that have impacted the federal
government’s cultural acceptance of OSS. It also discussed the current policy
framework that has been developed through a series of policies and guidelines
to support federal agencies in the adoption of OSS and the establishment
of processes and policies to encourage and support the development of OSS.
The remainder of this chapter will examine the key issues that have impacted
OSS adoption and briefly examine the role of OSS in the adoption of cloud com-
puting within the federal government.

Open Source Software and the Federal Government

OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE ADOPTION CHALLENGES:
ACQUISITION AND SECURITY
The adoption of OSS as previously mentioned, has faced a number of roadblocks
within the federal government. In this section, we will focus our examination spe-
cifically on the acquisition and security challenges that have been key inhibitors
in the broad adoption of OSS. In addition, through our review we will obtain a
better understanding of how the federal government’s relationship with OSS has
changed over time and gain some insight into how this experience has eased the
path to cloud computing.
NOTE
In a blog post titled “Streaming at 1:00: In the Cloud” [13], former US CIO Vivek Kundra noted
three critical challenges facing the federal government in deploying new IT services and products:
•
Procurement processes can be confusing and time-consuming.
•
Security procedures are complex, costly, lengthy, and duplicative across agencies.
•
Our (federal government) policies lag behind new trends, causing unnecessary restrictions on
the use of new technology.
ACQUISITION CHALLENGES
In the past, federal agencies have relied upon limited acquisition policy guidance52
when considering the procurement and the use of OSS. In the PITAC report [14]
discussed previously, two specific acquisition-related findings were highlighted:
•
Licensing agreements—numerous licensing agreements, incompatible
licensing requirements, and educating federal managers on open source
licenses53 and conditions.54
•
Federal procurement rules—no explicit authorization of competition between
open source alternatives and proprietary software, and lack of guidance on
applicability and usage of OSS.

commercial computer software (or “commercial item means”)—“(1) customarily used by the

CHAPTER 3 A case for open source

Even with the limited policies guidance, federal agencies were required to
understand how federal laws and regulations applied to the acquisition of OSS.
Table 3.2 provides several references within federal laws and regulations that
must be considered by federal agencies when procuring OSS (and other proprie-
tary) COTS products.
In addition, federal agencies are also required to understand how to select and
apply the various types of software licenses, specifically “where future modifica-
tions by the US government may be necessary” [15]. Guidelines in developing
license criteria [16] used in determining which OSS license to use could include:
•
Using an existing OSS license; not creating a new OSS license.
•
Making sure it is actually OSS.
•
Using a GPL-compatible license.
•
Choosing a license that meets the expected uses of the OSS.
•
Using a common OSS license.
In order to dispel concerns over these license issues, several policy documents
were issued to govern acquisition and provide guidance on the use of OSS within
the federal government. The OSS acquisition policy framework, outlined in
Table 3.3, consists primarily of the existing OMB and DoD policies; however,
some federal agencies have issued additional guidance55 to provide specific direc-
tion on how OSS could be used to support their specific mission and business

requirements. In addition to the policy documents, several frequently asked ques-
tions (FAQs) have been developed to facilitate understanding key acquisition-
related issues (see Table 3.4).
SECURITY CHALLENGES
OSS has previously been characterized as offering a number of potential security
advantages. The security advantages56 include the ability for developers to access
the source code, allowing for a more thorough examination and identification of
security vulnerabilities, and an increased number of availability of programmers
searching for bugs and subsequently developing fixes [14]. However, some of the
same advantages have also been overshadowed by hindrances such as uncertainty
of the trustworthiness of code repositories and the availability of source code to
allow malicious attackers the ability to identify security vulnerabilities.
Challenges associated with security in OSS have also existed because there
has been a lack of clarification and education of the processes and certifications
required to ensure that software is validated for use within the federal govern-
ment. Some of the commonly used processes57 and certification methodologies
that are required for verifying that software and applications meet federal security
requirements include, but are not limited to:
•
NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).58
•
DoD Information Assurance Security Certification and Accreditation Process
(DIACAP).59

In addressing the challenges with OSS security, the federal government initi-
ated a number of programs “to investigate open security methods, models and
technologies and identify viable and sustainable approaches that support national
cyber security objectives” [18]. For example, the US Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), Science and Technology (S&T), and Directorate Cyber Security
Research and Development Center (CSRDC) manages the Homeland Open
Security Technology (HOST)62 program, which is an information portal for open-
source security tools and applications. In addition, the DHS also initiated the
Open Source Hardening Project to maintain a database of analyzed OSS using the
coverity scan.63 The scan website offers qualified project developers of OSS with
a portal where they can retrieve defects identified by Coverity64 analyses [19].
OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AND FEDERAL CLOUD COMPUTING
Open source technologies have played a significant role in the federal govern-
ment’s adoption of cloud computing. From the inception of the 25-Point
Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management,
which introduced the key components of the federal government’s adoption of
“light technologies” and “shared solutions,” the federal government has initiated
the shift toward more openness and shared platforms. Openness and shared plat-
forms support the ability of the federal government to deliver agility and innova-
tion. OSS has served as the enabler, spawning incubations65 in technologies
across the industry and public sector that have formed the foundation of many of
the cloud computing platforms.

CHAPTER 3 A case for open source

NOTE
In 2003, NASA began “assessing the formal barriers to distributing software they developed as
open source and began reviewing the state of open source licenses”66 [20]. Open source67 directly
addressed NASA’s needs of the rapid and wide dissemination of software with minimal overhead
and cost, supporting its functions under the National Aeronautics and Space Act.68 However, it
was not until September 15, 2009, when the former US CIO Vivek Kundra announced the launch
of Apps.gov69 at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC),70 did it set the stage for the next
phase in the federal government’s adoption of public cloud computing services. During this time,
NASA ARC had already begun an effort in the development of a cloud environment through the
Nebula project.71 NASA Nebula, “which started out as a Web consolidation exercise” [21],
succeeded primarily because of the experience obtained through NASA’s involvement in OSS.72
Following experimentation with both commercial and open source cloud computing solutions, the
Nebula project initiated an effort to begin building the first open source Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS) cloud software platform.73 Nebula provided a case study for demonstrating the value OSS
brought to the federal government.
The Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) is a federal consolida-
tion effort focused on reducing physical space by shifting IT investments to more
efficient computing platforms and technologies [22]. These computing platforms and
technologies leverage virtualization to support the ability to consolidate and improve
government-wide IT utilization through shared infrastructures. The Cloud First and
Shared First policies were established to increase the return on investment (ROI)
associated with the federal government’s use of its IT investment. The optimization
of IT investment requires the use of the economies of scale offered by cloud

commuting and other shared service74 platforms. By leveraging reuse offered by
OSS and the consolidation of redundant missions, through cross-organizational cloud
services, efficiency can be delivered through more “economical” and “shared” deliv-
ery service models. The Digital Government Strategy, as illustrated in Fig. 3.2, reit-
erated the need to deliver more efficient customer-centric services at a lower cost
point through technologies that support the information,75 platform,76 and presenta-

platform to support the federal government’s ability to manage information78 in an
organized manner and deliver the information using multiple accessibility modes
(e.g., websites and mobile applications). A shared platform approach also provides
an efficient and low-cost mechanism to develop and deliver services and information
that support the strategy through three strategic objectives:
•
Securely architect for interoperability and openness.
•
Develop governance structure for digital services79 (e.g., procurement and
security policies and processes).
•
Spur innovation by providing the federal government’s data in open and
machine-readable formats.
OSS, as an enabler for cloud computing and other shared platforms, has acceler-
ated the shift in technology delivery models, both in the public and private sectors.
OSS has also produced many of the key technology innovations that are built into
the foundation of this technology shift, such as different virtualization80 technologies
and cloud computing81 platforms. These technologies and platforms can be lever-
aged to support the federal government’s digital strategy through an open, standards-
based approach that provides a more efficient use of rapidly evolving technologies.
In addition, many OSS projects utilize a shared development methodology.
This methodology promotes agility by bringing together a community of developers
that can deliver innovative solutions faster and with fewer dedicated resources.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, a case for open source was presented with a focus on understand-
ing how the accelerated pathway to the cloud was, in part, contributed to by the
broader government-wide acceptance of OSS. Challenges faced by the federal
government in addressing acquisition were examined, which included licensing

Security and Privacy Issues
INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 1, Introduction to the federal cloud computing strategy, we already
learned that public cloud computing presents the federal government with signifi-
cant opportunities for reduced cost and improved operational efficiency. In this
chapter, the discussion will focus specifically on security and privacy within the
context of public cloud computing.
Public cloud services can provide benefits for improved information security,
and even enhance privacy practices. But the benefits of public cloud computing
can be outweighed by potential security and privacy issues, concerns, or risks1 if
there is not a comprehensive “due diligence” process. The due diligence process
outlined in Chapter 1, helps ensure the issues, concerns, or risks are integrated into
the preliminary cloud service selection and assessment activities.

The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy [1] highlighted several potential security benefits that can
be achieved through the use of cloud services, to include:
•
Staff specialization—the ability to focus resources on areas of high concern as more general
security services are assumed by the cloud provider.
•
Platform strength—potential platform strength resulting from greater uniformity and
homogeneity, and resulting improved information assurance, security response, system
management, reliability, and maintainability.
•
Resource availability—improved resource availability through scalability, redundancy, and
disaster recovery capabilities; improved resilience to unanticipated service demands.
•
Backup and recovery—improved backup and recovery capabilities, policies, procedures, and
consistency.
•
Data concentration—ability to leverage alternate cloud service to improve the overall security
posture than that of traditional data centers.
Security and privacy are distinct and independent disciplines in which aspects
of privacy, as will be discussed later in this chapter, include specific principles
and considerations that do not necessarily overlap with security. But foundational
security practices are required for privacy to be effective in a public cloud com-
puting environment. Therefore, the information that will be hosted within a public
cloud service needs to be designed and operate to meet the same security and pri-
vacy requirements as traditional federal information systems. Federal agencies
will likely base their analysis in the context of their own use cases2 for a public
cloud service to ensure the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has addressed all appli-
cable laws, regulations, and policies. Their analysis could leverage existing prac-
tices when considering general security and privacy issues (e.g., data location,
data ownership, risk, visibility, etc.) for privacy-related information that will be
stored, processed, or transmitted through the use of public cloud services.
The transition to a public cloud service requires federal agencies and CSPs to
review their governance practices (i.e., policies, procedures, and processes) to
ensure, from an organizational perspective, that the existing roles and responsibil-
ities can operate effectively in the context of privacy. Federal agencies may also
have to introduce new risk management3 processes. Risk assessments performed
in a traditional computing environment where the federal agency has more control
over the risks mitigations may not be possible to achieve within a public cloud
service, and will instead require a close coordination with the CSP to ensure that

mitigations are appropriately integrated and managed. Therefore, the consistency
between the federal agencies’ and the CSPs’ risk management process is essential
to ensure that risks identified are adequately prioritized and mitigated through the
selection and implementation of security controls that minimize the “significant
privacy concerns associated with the [public] cloud computing environment” [2].
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP),4
which will be discussed in more detail in later chapters, provides a common
framework that uses existing processes and practices already used by federal
agencies to verify the security and privacy requirements.5 For example, a Privacy
Impact Assessment (PIA)6 is a tool already required by federal agencies7 and is
used to determine the type of privacy-related information stored, processed, or
transmitted through the use of the target public cloud computing environment. In
addition, the PIA helps to guide the determination of the types of protections that
are required for selecting appropriate security and privacy controls that need to be
implemented by CSPs to adequately mitigate identified risks to privacy informa-
tion. In addition, the Federal Enterprise Architecture Security and Privacy Profile
(FEA-SPP)8 can be used by federal agencies (and CSPs) in the context of public
cloud computing to address the identification of information security and data
privacy requirements [3].
SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE PUBLIC CLOUD
Public cloud computing by definition is a service that is owned, managed, and
operated by a service provider (e.g., private company, federal or state govern-
ment, etc.) on its premises and is consumed by the general public [4]. Cloud com-
puting delivery models are comparably different from what is commonly used by
many federal agencies where their information systems are hosted within tradi-
tional, dedicated infrastructures located within a federal data center or in a

contractor’s data center. New types of technologies and delivery models will
likely introduce new definitions of public cloud services, making it important to
have a common context9 for federal agencies to use when determining how the
public cloud service will be used to store, process, or transmit sensitive data col-
lected to support their mission and business requirements.
For the purpose of this chapter, the NIST definition provides a good starting
point for discussing security and privacy issues in public cloud computing. The
basic characterization by NIST of public cloud computing only intended to serve
as a means for a broad comparison [5]. This definition is supported by a concep-
tual reference architecture, depicted in Fig. 4.1, (and taxonomy) that provides a
high-level illustration of security and privacy as cross-cutting and existing across
all architectural layers.
In addition, the conceptual reference architecture provides a useful tool for
focusing on the security and privacy requirements for what CSPs need to provide
rather than describing a specific solution that needs to be designed and implemen-
ted [4]. When federal agencies begin to plan for security and privacy considerations
in public cloud services, the generalization of the NIST definition can be further

expanded to include a definition of specific security and privacy security require-
ments. This elaboration of the basic NIST definition enables the selection of a com-
mon group of public cloud services based on an examination of the context given
by the federal agency’s requirements. In contrast, the CSP can perform a similar
activity by identifying a target group of federal agencies, and reflect their require-
ments in the context of their cloud service to determine if any additional security
and privacy controls need to be applied to make it acceptable for use.
TIP
The Federal Cloud Computing Strategy [1] identified several key security considerations to guide
federal agencies in assessing the risk in the context of the public cloud computing environment
and improve confidence in the use of cloud services:
•
carefully define security and privacy requirements during the initial planning stage at the start
of the systems development life cycle;
•
determine the extent to which negotiated service agreements are required to satisfy security
requirements; and the alternatives of using negotiated service agreements or cloud computing
deployment models that offer greater oversight and control over security and privacy;
•
assess the extent to which the server and client-side computing environment meets
organizational security and privacy requirements; and
•
continue to maintain security management practices, controls, and accountability over the
privacy and security of data and applications.
WARNING
Federal agencies are obligated through the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)
with a number of requirements that include, although not specifically limited to, Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) policies, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), federal agency-specific
policy requirements and authorization, and continuous monitoring requirements. Therefore, when
federal agencies make the decision to choose a public cloud service for their agencies’ outsourcing
needs, they have been encouraged to carefully consider the following types of factors:
•
statutory compliance (laws, regulations, and agency requirements);
•
data characteristics (fundamental protections an application’s data set requires);
•
privacy and confidentiality (protect against accidental and nefarious access to information);
•
integrity (ensure that data is authorized, complete, and accurate);
•
data controls and access policies (where data can be stored and who can access physical
locations); and
•
governance (ensure that cloud computing service providers are sufficiently transparent, have
adequate security and management controls, and provide the information necessary for the
agency to appropriately and independently assess and monitor the efficacy of those controls) [1].
FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS AND POLICIES
Privacy is a core value of American society. The importance of protecting privacy
information is already a part of many industries in which US federal privacy laws

span. Table 4.1 provides an example of some of the types of regulatory and legis-
lative frameworks that exist that might be relevant when considering the collec-
tion and storage of privacy-related information in a public cloud service.
In 1972, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HW) formed the
Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, “to analyze the conse-
quences of using computers to keep records about people” [7]. The committee
produced a report10 in which it was concluded that “safeguards for personal pri-
vacy based on our concept of mutuality in record-keeping would require adher-
ence by record-keeping organizations to certain fundamental principles of fair
information practice” [7]. The report recommended the adoption of a federal code
of Fair Information Practices (FIPs)11 for the protection of information within
computers (referred to as automated personal data systems). In 1980, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revised and
adopted the original FIPs and extended them to create a set of eight Fair
Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)12 listed in Table 4.2.
Many of the US privacy laws are based on the FIPPs as an industry recog-
nized a set of practices for protecting data and privacy.

CHAPTER 4 Security and privacy in public cloud computing

The federal government has the legal responsibility to ensure governance and
accountability of PII.13 Safeguarding PII in the possession of the federal govern-
ment and preventing its breach are essential to ensure the trust of the American
public [9]. Therefore, before we can effectively discuss potential security and pri-
vacy issues, a basic understanding is required of some of the significant privacy
Table 4.2 Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) [8]
FIPPs
Description
Collection
limitation
There should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such
data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where
appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject.
Data quality
Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are
to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should
be accurate, complete, and kept up-to-date.
Purpose
specification
The purposes for which personal data are collected should be
specified not later than at the time of data collection and the
subsequent use limited to the fulfillment of those purposes or such
others as are not incompatible with those purposes and as are
specified on each occasion of change of purpose.
Use limitation
Personal data should not be disclosed, made available, or otherwise
used for purposes other than those specified, except with the consent
of the data subject or by the authority of law.
Security
safeguards
Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards
against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use,
modification, or disclosure of data.
Openness
There should be a general policy of openness about developments,
practices, and policies with respect to personal data. Means should
be readily available of establishing the existence and nature of
personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the
identity and usual residence of the data controller.
Individual
participation
An individual should have the right: (a) to obtain from a data controller,
or otherwise, confirmation of whether or not the data controller has
data relating to him; (b) to have communicated to him, data relating to
him within a reasonable time; at a charge, if any, that is not excessive;
in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily intelligible to him;
(c) to be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a)
and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such denial; and (d) to
challenge data relating to him and, if the challenge is successful, to
have the data erased, rectified, completed, or amended.
Accountability
A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures
that give effect to the principles stated above.

laws and policies developed for the protection and preservation of privacy rights
of individuals by federal agencies.
PRIVACY ACT OF 1974
The Privacy Act of 197414 was established as a statutory framework to govern
the federal government’s collection and use of personal information. This statu-
tory framework balances the federal government’s need to maintain information
about individuals with the rights of individuals to be protected against unwar-
ranted invasions of their privacy stemming from the collection, maintenance, use,
and disclosure of personal information about them [10].
The Privacy Act is based on the internationally recognized FIPPs previously
discussed. The Act protects certain federal government records15 pertaining to
individuals,16 collected, maintained, used, and disseminated by federal agencies.
The records containing PII are stored in a system of records (SOR) which is “a
group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is
retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol,
or other identifying particular assigned to the individual” [11].
In accordance with the Privacy Act,17 federal agencies are required to give
public notice through a Systems of Records Notice (SORN) in the Federal
Registrar,18 that includes information about the SOR such as:
•
System name.
•
Security classification.
•
System location(s).19
•
Categories of individual covered by the system.

TIP
Under Section (m) of the Privacy Act, a government contractor’s information system is subject to
the requirements of the Act, if under contract, the federal agency contracts for the operation by or
on behalf of the agency, a SOR to accomplish an agency function [11]. Since CSPs may store
records covered under the Privacy Act, the CSPs’ cloud service could be considered a SOR and
be subject to the same requirements20 as federal agencies. In addition, a cloud service operated by
a CSP that is covered by the Privacy Act could be subject to civil and criminal implications if the
CSP knowingly and willfully acts or fails to act as described in the Privacy Act [12].
NOTE
The Privacy Act Issuances21
According to the Privacy Act, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) must biennially compile
and publish (1) descriptions of system of records maintained on individuals by federal agencies,
which were published in the Federal Register; and (2) rules of each agency, which set out the
procedures that agencies will follow in helping individuals who request information about their
records. In addition, the Privacy Act requires OFR to publish the compilation in a form available
to the public at a low cost [13].
The extension of Privacy Act requirements for the collection and storage of
PII to a public cloud service will likely need to be carefully evaluated by the CSP
and the federal agency for a cloud service operating as the federal agencies’ SOR.
“Once an agency chooses a cloud computing provider to collect and store infor-
mation, the individual is no longer providing information solely to the govern-
ment, but also to a third party who is not necessarily bound by the same laws and
regulations” [14]. Since federal agencies are “ultimately accountable for the secu-
rity and privacy of data held by a cloud provider on their behalf” [4], the require-
ments of the Privacy Act and the responsibility for the implementation of privacy
controls will be discussed later in this chapter. Therefore, assistance or require-
ments by the CSP to support the federal agency meeting requirements under the

Security and Privacy in the Context of the Public Cloud

Privacy Act will need to be clearly addressed through a contractual obligation
(e.g., protecting privacy information, and reporting breaches or disclosures).
FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MODERNIZATION ACT
(FISMA)
The FISMA provides federal agencies with a recommended set of security control
requirements22 necessary to protect information contained within an information
system.23 In addition, federal agencies are required to identify and assess the risk
to their PII, and to ensure security controls are implemented to provide adequate
safeguards. Therefore, CSPs that collect, store, or process PII on behalf of the
federal government may have a responsibility to meet specific security require-
ments. These security requirements are based on the confidentiality,24 integrity,
and available objectives for the information identified as a result of a security cat-
egorization conducted by the CSP or the federal agency.
NIST was given the responsibility for developing standards and guidelines for
information systems. These standards and guidelines include providing federal
agencies with guidance25 on categorizing PII. The Privacy Act requires federal
agencies to establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure
the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated
threats or hazards to their security or integrity, which could result in substantial
harm, embarrassment, inconvenient, or unfairness on whom information is
obtained [9]. Harm is the adverse effect that would be experienced by an individ-
ual whose PII was the subject of a loss of confidentiality, as well as any adverse
effects experienced by the organization that maintains the PII [15]. Therefore, the
loss (or breach) of confidentiality would likely need to be evaluated against the
unauthorized disclosure of the PII and the “effect on the organizational

dentiality impact levels (see Table 4.3).
FISMA also required federal agencies to establish procedures for the detec-
tion, reporting, and response of security incidents. In addition, OMB requires fed-
eral agencies to report incidents involving PII to the US Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT).26
Incidents that involve breaches to PII are categorized by the US-CERT as a
Category 1 and require reporting within one hour of the discovery/detection. The
CSPs’ incident response plan27 will need to reflect any new requirements for noti-
fication and reporting28 by ensuring service agreements address the requirements
and responsibility for notification, reporting, and any costs associated with an
incident involving the compromise of PII.

OMB has established a number of governing policies for federal agencies
relating to PII over the years. Table 4.4 provides a list of applicable privacy-
related policies that must be adhered to by federal agencies.
SAFEGUARDING PRIVACY INFORMATION
Privacy and security can mean different things to different people because they are
identified as distinct disciplines. Privacy and security do overlap in many aspects.
Privacy is more than security, however, and includes the principles of transparency,
notice, and choice [17]. Although, it is widely agreed upon that some aspects of pri-
vacy require a sound security practice (e.g., accountability, integrity, confidentiality,
and data destruction). Therefore, it is important to recognize that “organizations can-
not have effective privacy without a solid foundation of information security” [17].
Privacy can be summarized as the need to protect certain information about
individuals and organizations and “involves the right to control when, where,
how, to whom, and to what extent an individual shares their own personal infor-
mation, as well as the right to access personal information given to others, to
correct it, and to ensure it is safeguarded and disposed of appropriately” [6].
Security, on the other hand, provides the safeguards (e.g., administrative,

Confidentiality refers to what data may be disclosed and to whom the data may
be disclosed, thereby ensuring that only legally authorized and appropriate disclo-
sures are made. Integrity is the assurance that information and information systems
are protected against improper or accidental modification. Availability is the assur-
ance of timely and reliable access to information and information systems by
authorized persons [18]. Fig. 4.2 provides an illustration that depicts the relationship
that exists between privacy (FIPPs) and security (Safeguards)33 and which might

Relationship between FIPPs and safeguards.

As we already discussed, FIPPs provide an internationally accepted frame-
work, reflected in many US laws for addressing privacy requirements. FIPPs also
serve as the basis for analyzing privacy risks and determining appropriate mitiga-
tion strategies [17].
NIST and the Federal CIO Council’s Privacy Committee developed a
comprehensive set of privacy controls34 for federal agencies to use for ensuring
they develop and implement appropriate privacy protections and practices to
achieve the organization’s privacy objectives. Privacy controls35 provide “a road-
map for organizations to use in identifying and implementing privacy controls
concerning the life cycle of PII” [17] and when to “address potential risks when
moving to a cloud computing environment” [19]. In addition, the privacy controls
can be used within existing federal government frameworks36 such as the Federal
Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) when specifying the
federal privacy requirements for government-wide use of public cloud services
when privacy-related information is involved.
PRIVACY CONTROLS
The privacy controls included in this section are based on those identified in the
Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.
Table 4.5 provides a description of each of the privacy control families. These
privacy controls provide the safeguards (i.e., administrative, technical, and physical)
to be implemented by the CSP or within the public cloud service when it has been
determined that PII is being collected and stored.

This family addresses the need to make individuals active
participants in the decision-making process regarding the
collection and use of their PII. By providing individuals with
access to PII and the ability to have their PII corrected or
amended, as appropriate, the controls in this family enhance
public confidence in organizational decisions made based on
the PII.
Security (SE)
This family supplements the security controls to ensure that
technical, physical, and administrative safeguards are in place
to protect PII collected or maintained by organizations against
loss, unauthorized access, or disclosure, and to ensure that
planning and responses to privacy incidents comply with
OMB policies and guidance. The controls in this family are
implemented in coordination with information security
personnel and in accordance with the existing NIST Risk
Management Framework.
Transparency (TR)
This family ensures that organizations provide public notice of
their information practices and the privacy impact of their
programs and activities.
Use Limitation (UL)
This family ensures that organizations only use PII either as
specified in their public notices, in a manner compatible with
those specified purposes, or as otherwise permitted by law.
Implementation of the controls in this family will ensure that
the scope of PII use is limited accordingly.

associated with responding to the incident, or even a loss of credibility, confi-
dence, and trust from existing customers or the public.
NOTE
On May 10, 2006, Executive Order 13402, “Strengthening Federal Efforts to Protect Against
Identity Theft,” was issued to create a Presidential Identity Theft Task Force to review and
advise on the execution of the policy42 set forth by the President of the United States for
“Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information.”
As a result of the Task Force, OMB issued a policy reiterating the privacy and security
requirements for federal agencies under the Privacy Act (and other laws, executive orders,
regulations, and policies), and required federal agencies to develop and implement breach
notification policies.
In addition, it highlighted new technical controls that were to supplement those already
required under US laws and policies. For example, OMB established additional security
requirements for the protection of all federal information (regardless of whether it was covered
under the Privacy Act). These security requirements included:
•
encryption using NIST-certified cryptographic modules43 to mobile computers/devices,
•
two-factor authentication for remote access,
•
enforcement of a “time-out” capability requiring re-authentication after 30 minutes of
inactivity, and
•
logging and verification of all data extracts from database containing sensitive
information, including the verification of destruction after 90 days (if no longer being
used).
Data breaches can also occur for a variety of reasons. Some occur due to
intentional actions such as theft of information; others are due to negligence or
accidents. Intentional actions involve breaches such as hacking, employee theft,
theft of physical equipment, or deception or misrepresentation to obtain unautho-
rized data. Negligence or accidental losses include loss of laptop computers or
other hardware, loss of data tapes, unintentional exposure on the Internet, or
improper disposal of data [20].

EPIC FAIL
Data Security Breaches
On May 7, 2007, the Congressional Research Services (CRS) reported on personal data security
breaches to Congress through a report titled “Data Security Breaches: Context and Incident
Summaries.” The breaches were not only due to illegal activity such as hacking or unauthorized
employee accesses, but also due to poor security and privacy practices such as lost laptops and
posting of personal data to public websites. Data security breaches have covered business,
education, financial, government, and healthcare industries:
Business
•
March 2007—Hacker broke into the website of Johnny’s Selected Seeds (Winslow, ME) and
stole credit card information in which 20 were used fraudulently [21].
•
February 2007—TJ Maxx computer systems were hacked, which resulted in drivers’ license
numbers, names, and addresses being compromised [21].
Education
•
April 2007—Ohio State University’s firewall was bypassed by hackers using foreign Internet
in which the names, Social Security numbers, employee identification numbers, and birthdates
of current and former staff members were stolen [21].
•
April 2007—University of California, San Francisco’s campus server was compromised over a
two-year period in which the names, Social Security numbers, and bank accounts for students,
faculty, and staff were allegedly affected [21].
Financial
•
December 2006—TD Ameritrade’s computers were hacked by criminals using stolen
customer accounts requiring them to cover approximately $4 million in fraudulent
transactions [21].
•
December 2005—Scottrade Inc. was hacked through the Internet in which the customers’
names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, phone numbers, bank names, bank routing
information, bank account numbers, and Scottrade account numbers were allegedly
stolen [21].
Government
•
June 2015—OPM discovered that the background investigation records of current, former, and
prospective federal employees and contractors had been stolen [22].
•
February 2007—Personal information (names and Social Security numbers) were
inadvertently posted to Connecticut State Administrative Services Department’s
website [21].
•
November 2006—Bowling Green Ohio Police Department inadvertent published personal data
(names, Social Security numbers, and phone numbers) to website [21].
Healthcare
•
March 2007—Westerly Hospital in Westerly, RI, allegedly posted patients’ confidential
information (name, Social Security number, and insurance information) posted on public
website [21].
•
Ohio Board of Nursing posted the names and Social Security numbers of nurses to their
website twice in one month [21].
111
Safeguarding Privacy Information

Consequences and accountability are important aspects to ensure compliance
with federal privacy laws and policies that lead to the adequate handling and safe-
guarding of PII. To address this necessity, OMB requires federal agencies to
develop and implement a rules and consequences policy that facilitates the train-
ing and enforcement of adherence by employees, contractors, or others involved
in handling PII collected and stored by the federal government, other federal
government agencies, or service providers on a federal agency’s behalf.
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES
Overcoming security and privacy issues in public cloud computing requires a fed-
eral agency to gain a better understanding of their risks and the necessary security
and privacy requirements that need to exist. Using situational analysis techniques
such as SWOT44 (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats), a federal
agency can analyze the different public cloud service offerings from various
CSPs. The analysis can be used to determine if privacy and security-related
issues, identified in Table 4.6, believed to have long-term significance for cloud
Table 4.6 Key Security and Privacy Issues and CSP Actions [4]
Issues
CSP Actions
Governance
Align federal agency practices pertaining to the policies,
procedures, and standards used for application development
and service provisioning in the cloud computing environment.
Compliance
Understand the various types of federal laws and regulations
that may impose security and privacy obligations.
Trust
Allow the federal agency visibility into the security and privacy
controls and processes employed.
Architecture
Provide the federal agency with technical details into the
technologies used to provision the cloud services.
Identity and access
management
Review in-place safeguards against the federal agency’s
requirements to ensure it provides adequate security for
authentication and authorization, and other identity and access
management functions.
Software isolation
Understand the federal agency’s requirements and potential risk
associated with using the cloud service virtualization and other
logical isolation techniques.
Data protection
Understand the federal agency’s data management
requirements to include access control and protection at-rest or
in-transit, and deposition.
Availability
Understand the federal agency’s availability, data backup and
recovery, and disaster recovery requirements.
Incident response
Align with the federal agency’s incident response procedures.

computing [4] exist. In addition, any applicable service agreements (or a separate
contract)45 used can be updated to ensure that the CSP satisfies the federal
agency’s security and privacy requirements.
SUMMARY
Public cloud computing presents many opportunities for the federal government
to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. But it requires clear under-
standing of the security and privacy requirements and examining the risks of the
types of information that will be placed in the cloud and requiring an appropriate
level of assurance through the application of security service and privacy controls.
Although cloud computing is evolving, the application of appropriate frameworks
such as the FEA-SPP and tools such as PIAs can assist in predicting the implica-
tions and consequences of collecting and storing privacy in a public cloud
service.

•
NIST RMF Process
INTRODUCTION TO FISMA
The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)1 was signed into
law on December 18, 2014 in Public Law 113δ283. FISMA 2014 extended the
provisions of FISMA 2002, which permanently reauthorized the framework laid
out in the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA) of 2000, which
expired in November 2002 [1]. FISMA is divided into multiple sections, each of
which will be briefly described in this section.
PURPOSE
FISMA 2002 was built upon several existing federal laws designed to ensure the
security of federal information and information systems. These federal laws
include the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 10035),2 Paperwork
1The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 replaced the Federal
Information Security Management Act of 2002, signed into law on December 17, 2002 as part of
the E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347).
2From 100th Congress. Public Law 100235, Computer Security Act of 1987 (40 U.S.C. 759
note). Washington, DC: US Congress; 1987. “To provide for a computer standards program within

vide for the training in security matters of persons who are involved in the management, operation,
and use of Federal computer systems, and for other purposes.”

Reduction Act of 1995 (Public Law 10413),3 and Information Technology
Management Reform Act of 1996 (i.e., Clinger-Cohen Act, Public Law 104106,
Division E).4 FISMA 2014 codified the role of the Secretary of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), and the operational role of DHS through the issuance
of Binding Operational Directives (BODs)5 and the requirement for the use of
automated tools.
The purpose of FISMA, as outlined in Section 3551,6 is covered in six major
objectives. In this chapter, the focus will be on 14:
1. Establishment of a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of
security controls over information resources that support federal operations
and assets.
2. Provide effective government-wide management and oversight of security-
related risks, including coordination of information security efforts throughout
the civilian, national security, and law enforcement communities.
3. Development and maintenance of a minimum set of required security controls
to protect federal information and information systems.
3From 104th Congress. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Washington, DC: US Congress; 1995.
In part it ensured “the creation, collection, maintenance, use, dissemination, and disposition of
information by or for the Federal Government is consistent with applicable laws, including laws
relating to the privacy and confidentiality, including section 552a of title 5, security of information,
including the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100235); and access to information,
including section 552 of title 5.”
4Public Law 104106, Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (also known as
the ClingerCohen Act) directed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
develop standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques for federal computer systems.
The standards and guidelines issued by NIST, known as Federal Information Processing Standards
(FIPS), are used government-wide and developed when there are compelling federal government
requirements and there are no existing voluntary standards to address the federal requirements for
the interoperability of different systems, the portability of data and software, and computer
security.

each department and agency is responsible for managing its own cybersecurity. However, under
the Federal Information Security Modernization Act(FISMA) of 2014, DHS is provided with the
authority to administer the implementation of federal cybersecurity policies. In order to carry out
this important responsibility, DHS is authorized to issue binding operational directives, monitor
agency cybersecurity practices, and provide operational and technical assistance.”

4. Provide a mechanism for improved oversight of federal agency information
security programs, including through automated security tools to continuously
diagnose7 and improve security.
5. Utilization of commercially developed information security products for
protecting critical information infrastructures.
6. Selection of commercially developed hardware and software information
security solutions should be left to individual federal agencies.
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The assignment of roles and responsibilities for information security within the
federal government was clarified or reiterated within FISMA to cover policy, pro-
curement, standards, and incident response. Although FISMA was the last major
legislative framework, over the years the foundation has been built upon by a
series of executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards and guide-
lines. Within FISMA, several specific roles were identified:
•
Director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
•
Secretary of Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
•
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
•
Federal Agencies:
•
Head of Agency or equivalent.
•
Chief Information Officer (CIO).
•
Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO).
In this section, each role will be discussed as it relates to the responsibilities
described in FISMA.
Director of OMB
OMB has as one of its key roles8 the responsibility to implement and enforce
government-wide policies. Through FISMA, the Director of OMB was given the

Available from: https://www.dhs.gov/cdm. “The Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM)
program is a dynamic approach to fortifying the cybersecurity of government networks and sys-
tems. CDM provides federal departments and agencies with capabilities and tools that identify
cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, prioritize these risks based upon potential impacts, and
enable cybersecurity personnel to mitigate the most significant problems first. Congress established
the CDM program to provide adequate, risk-based, and cost-effective cybersecurity and more effi-
ciently allocate cybersecurity resources. The CDM program enables government entities to expand
their continuous diagnostic capabilities by increasing their network sensor capacity, automating
sensor collections, and prioritizing risk alerts.”

Introduction to FISMA

authority for overseeing the federal agency implementation and enforcement of
security policies and practices. The authorities included:
•
Developing and overseeing the implementation of policies, principles,
standards, and guidelines on information security (including ensuring timely
adoption and compliance by federal agencies).
•
Requiring federal agencies to identify and provide for the information
security protection for federal information systems and information,
commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from
the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification,
or destruction.
•
Ensuring that the DHS Secretary carries out their authorities and functions.
•
Coordinating and developing standards and guidelines.
•
Overseeing and enforcing federal agency compliance with FISMA requirements.
•
Coordinating information security policies and procedures with related
information resources management policies and procedures.
•
Reporting annually to Congress on compliance by federal agencies with
FISMA requirements (no later than March 1).9
These authorities were limited with respect to national security systems
(NSSs),10 except as they relate to budgetary actions and annual reporting to
Congress. In this chapter, only those aspects of NSSs related to the NIST Risk
Management Framework (RMF) will be discussed.11
9The annual FISMA report includes: summary of findings of annual independent evaluations
(e.g., Office of Inspector General Audits), assessment of adoption, and compliance with the NIST
standards and guidelines, significant deficiencies in federal agency information security practices,
any planned remediation actions to address deficiencies, and summary of a report developed by the
NIST.

CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

Secretary of DHS
DHS has the responsibility for the operational aspects of federal agency cyberse-
curity with respect to the federal information systems. Through FISMA, the
Director of DHS was given the authority for:
•
Assisting the Director of OMB.
•
Developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational
directives (BODs) to federal agencies to implement the policies, principles,
standards, and guidelines developed by the Director of OMB.
•
Monitoring federal agency implement of information security policies and
practices.
•
Convening meeting with senior agency officials to help ensure effective
implementation of information security policies and practices.
•
Coordinating Government-wide efforts on information security policies and
practices.
•
Providing operational and technical assistance to federal agencies in
implementing policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information
security.
•
Ensuring the operation of a central Federal information security incident
response center.
NIST
NIST, under FISMA, was assigned the responsibility to develop standards, guide-
lines, and associated methods and techniques for federal agencies. These standards
and guidelines include the minimum requirements for providing adequate informa-
tion security for federal information systems (excluding national security systems):
•

Federal Agencies
Federal agencies are required to comply with the provisions defined in FISMA.
As part of their obligation, they must ensure for the protection of federal informa-
tion and information systems commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm
resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction [2]. This includes complying with information security standards15 for
non-NSSs and standards and guidelines16 for NSSs. Federal agencies must also
ensure that information security is an integrated part of their strategic planning
and operational planning processes so there is alignment of goals and objectives.

responsibility for ensuring senior agency officials (e.g., authorizing officials) pro-
vide for the protection of federal information and information systems for which
they have budgetary oversight, or which support the mission and/or business
operations [3]. Protections include:
•
Conducting risk assessments;
•
Categorizing information and information systems;
•
Implementing security policies and procedures; and
•
Periodically testing and evaluating security controls and techniques.
The Head of the Agency must ensure that security policies, procedures, and
practices are adequate. To support this requirement, the Head of the Agency is
required to designate a Federal Agency CIO with the authority for the compliance
of FISMA. The Federal Agency CIO, in turn, designates his or her information
technology (IT) security responsibilities to a Senior Agency Information Security
Officer (SAISO),17 who is both qualified and trained in information security.
These IT security responsibilities include:
•
Developing and maintaining an information security program;
•
Developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and
controls;
•
Training and overseeing personnel with significant information security
responsibilities; and
•
Assisting authorizing officials (AO).
Federal Agency Information Security Program
Federal agencies are also required to establish an agency-wide information secu-
rity program. The program developed by the federal agency must address the fol-
lowing requirements:
•
Periodically assessing the risk and magnitude of the harm that could result
from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction of information and information systems that support the operations
and assets of the agency, which may include using automated tools consistent
with NIST standards and guidelines;
•
Developing security policies and procedures;
•
Developing subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for
networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems;
•
Providing security awareness training to inform personnel, including
contractors and other users of information systems that support the operations
and assets of the agency;
17In most federal agencies the title for this role is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
123
Introduction to FISMA

•
Developing a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and
documenting remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information
security policies, procedures, and practices of the agency;
•
Developing procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security
incidents, including an incident response capability; and
•
Developing plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for
information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.
Federal Agency Independent Evaluations and Reporting
On an annual basis, federal agencies are required by law to conduct an indepen-
dent evaluation of their information security program to ensure its effective-
ness. The independent evaluations involve the testing of the effectiveness of the
organization’s policies, procedures, and practices, and an assessment compli-
ance with FISMA, including any supporting federal policies, procedures, stan-
dards, and guidelines. The results of the independent evaluations are sent
through the Head of the Agency to the Director of OMB. The Director of OMB
includes information from all independent evaluations across the federal gov-
ernment and develops a comprehensive summary in a government-wide report
that is submitted to Congress.18
TIP
To support federal agencies in evaluating their programs, NIST developed the Program Review
for Information Security Management Assistance (PRISMA).19 The PRISMA methodology uses
“a standardized approach to review and measure the information security posture of an
information security program” [4]. The PRISMA process includes 11 steps that cover both
preparation and execution.
Preparation Steps:
•
Review initiation.
•
Review scope definition.
•

CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW
The NIST RMF20 is a flexible, risk-based approach that is driven by the organiza-
tion’s information security program, and supports the management of risk21
by facilitating the sharing22 of information. The NIST RMF objectives [4]
include:
•
Building information security capabilities into federal information systems;
•
Maintaining awareness of the security state of information systems through
ongoing continuous monitoring; and
•
Providing essential information to key stakeholders to facilitate decisions
regarding the acceptance of risk.
Risk management is an essential element of the NIST RMF, which requires
linking risks to an organization-wide information security program. This enables
the organization to have a broader view of risks, including those across all infor-
mation systems within the enterprise. Since the NIST RMF is a more technical
approach, organizations will need to ensure that risk-based decisions are consid-
ered from a strategic viewpoint where the impact to the organization’s goals and
objectives is more visible.
For the NIST RMF to be effective, the organization needs to identify and
communicate program-level security requirements that all information systems
within the enterprise should meet. This also limits the duplication of risk manage-
ment activities where common capabilities can be integrated or even shared by
each information system within the overall organization-wide information security
program. In this section, we will briefly discuss the role of the risk management
when applying the NIST RMF and how closely aligning the system development
life cycle (SDLC) processes enables security-related information produced during
the SDLC to be reused to support the risk management process.
20The NIST RMF was developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative (JTFTI) Working
Group, a partnership with stakeholders from the US Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence
Community (IC), and NIST, as a common framework for government-wide risk management.

Publication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to
Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of
Standards and Technology; 2010. “Risk management can be viewed as a holistic activity that is
fully integrated into every aspect of the organization—from senior leaders providing the strategic
vision and top-level goals and objectives for the organization, to mid-level leaders planning and
managing projects, to individuals on the front lines developing, implementing, and operating the
systems supporting the organization’s core missions and business processes.”

nizations to accept each other’s security assessments in order to reuse information system
resources and/or to accept each other’s assessed security posture in order to share information.”

Risk Management Framework Overview

THE ROLE OF RISK MANAGEMENT
The effective application of the NIST RMF requires the integration of risk
management23 activities at different levels within an organization. As illustrated
in Fig. 5.1, the risk management process begins at the organizational level
(Tier 1) where the governance structure and risk management strategy are
developed.
The risk management strategy24 supports the organization’s strategic goals
and objectives. To link the risk management strategy with the mission and
business processes (Tier 2), risk management should be addressed as a part of
the enterprise architecture.25 Finally, at the information system level (Tier 3),
the appropriate safeguards and countermeasures are applied to the information
and information system through the selection, implementation, and assessment of
security controls that have traceability to the security requirements26 established
by the organization and allocated within the information security architecture.
This alignment between the NIST RMF and the SDLC is critical to ensure there
is an early integration of security with the appropriate inputs from stakeholders
across the organization.

operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation, and includes: (i) establishing the context for risk-related
activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii) responding to risk once determined; and (iv) monitoring risk
over time.”
24The Risk Management Strategy will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, Risk Management.

to satisfy security requirements and provide appropriate mission and business protection.
Security capabilities are typically defined by bringing together a specific set of safeguards/coun-
termeasures (i.e., security controls) derived from the appropriately tailored baselines that
together produce the needed capability.”

different communities and groups in different ways and may require additional explanation to
establish the particular context for the various use cases. It is important to define the context for
each use of the term security requirement so the respective communities (including individuals
responsible for policy, architecture, acquisition, engineering, and mission/business protection) can
clearly communicate their intent.”

Tier risk management approach.

THE NIST RMF AND THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
As previously discussed, the alignment of activities included in the NIST RMF
with a traditional SDLC27 ensures risk management becomes an integrated part of
the information system life cycle. At each phase of the SDLC, as illustrated in
Fig. 5.2, specific security considerations are integrated, starting at the initiation
phase where requirements definition begins.
Security requirements28 addressed later within the SDLC instead of includ-
ing them in the original system design could unnecessarily increase costs and
delay the authorization process. By defining NIST RMF activities within the
context of the system development process, weaknesses, and deficiencies identi-
fied early in the SDLC could improve the effectiveness of security testing per-
formed later in the NIST RMF (e.g., assessing and monitoring security
controls). Since information systems typically exist at some phase of the SDLC
and will continue to evolve throughout their life cycle, integrating the NIST
RMF into the life cycle process enables risks to be mitigated or eliminated
through information security and risk management-related activities. For exam-
ple, the security-related information produced through development security
testing may be reused later in SDLC (e.g., implementation/assessment or the
operation/maintenance phases).
NIST RMF PROCESS
The NIST RMF is a task-oriented process that is driven by the risk management
activities applied at all levels of the organization. The tasks addressed within the
NIST RMF include different risk-related activities that support the organization’s
risk management strategy. Since Chapter 6, Risk Management, will cover
enterprise-wide risk management in more detail, this chapter will limit the focus
of risk management as it relates to the information system (Tier 3), as shown in
Fig. 5.1. The risk management activities included in Fig. 5.3 involve applying the

steps included within the NIST RMF as a part of a security life cycle approach.
The steps performed within the NIST RMF include:
•
categorizing the information and information system;
•
selecting the security control baseline;
•
implementing the selected security controls;
•
assessing the security controls;
•
authorizing information system operation; and
•
monitoring the security controls.
INFORMATION SYSTEM CATEGORIZATION
The categorization of the information system is the first step in the NIST RMF (Step
1), and one of the most essential activities29 required for the selection of a baseline
set of security controls (and privacy controls, where applicable). As discussed earlier
in the chapter, FISMA tasked NIST with the responsibility to develop standards and
guidelines. The standards included procedures for categorizing information and infor-
mation systems, and the guidelines for categorizing the different types30 of federal
information that will be processed, stored, or transmitted within the information sys-
tem. The first step in the NIST RMF (Step 1), as shown in Table 5.1, includes three
major tasks. In this section, the discussion will primarily focus on the first task (1-1).
The security categorization process is driven by the need for federal agencies
(or others operating on behalf of federal agencies) to identify the types of infor-
mation31 that will be processed, stored, or transmitted in the information system,
a critical requirement for understanding the security objectives (confidentiality,32

also ensures that the selected security controls implemented provide the adequate
security35 to meet the organization’s security objectives. As will be discussed in
detail in this chapter, the application of a standardized approach to categorizing
information systems enables a common framework to be used across the federal
government for the management and oversight of information systems and in
reports relating to agency-specific information security to OMB and government-
wide information security to Congress.

132
CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

The application of the security categorization process becomes complex
when external information system services36 are used by federal agencies in
processing, transmitting, or storing information collected or maintained on
behalf of the federal government. In these instances, a federal agency’s reli-
ance upon an external service does not limit its overall responsibility for
ensuring the security categorization of the external service being used is
consistent with the different types of information that will be used within the
service to support its mission or business needs. Without an understanding of
the security categorization of the information being used in the external ser-
vice, the federal agency will not be able to determine the necessary require-
ments that must be used by the service provider to ensure that the service
operates at a security level consistent with the federal agency’s minimum
assurance requirements.
Relationship between the NIST RMF and the Federal Enterprise
Architecture
The enterprise architecture is a management practice employed to maximize the
effectiveness of mission/business process and information resources [5]. As
illustrated in Fig. 5.4, the enterprise assets identified within the enterprise archi-
tecture are mapped to the individual federal agency’s mission and business pro-
cesses through the reference models provided in the Federal Enterprise

Architecture (FEA)37 and the resulting segment architecture.38 The application
of the mapping ensures the information resources are properly aligned with
each federal agency’s strategic goals and objectives.
The relationship between the federal agency’s enterprise architecture39 and the
application of the NIST RMF begins with the initial security categorization.
Security categorization provides a vital step in integrating security into the busi-
ness and information technology management functions and establishes the foun-
dation for information security standardization.40 The security categorization
process is largely dependent upon the knowledge of the information supporting
the federal government. By utilizing a framework similar to the one depicted in
Fig. 5.5, the security categorization process is adopted as an enterprise-level view-
point for “each type of information as identified from the FEA Performance
Reference Model (PRM)41 and Business Reference Model (BRM)42 analysis” [6].
This produces a government-wide approach for evaluating the “level of potential
impact values assigned to the respective security objectives” [7] (i.e., confidenti-
ality, integrity, and availability) that are used for establishing the information
security and privacy requirements in the security control selection step of the
NIST RMF (Step 3). The results provide for a strong linkage between the mission,
the information, and the information systems with a focus on the cost-effective
application of information security [8].

CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

Shared Responsibility and the Chain of Trust
In general, the application of the NIST RMF requires a shared responsibility43
and a chain of trust.44 The relationship between federal agencies and service
providers requires operating through terms and conditions defined in a contract,
which includes detailed security control requirements or managed through a

and the cloud consumer have differing degrees of control over the computing resources in a cloud
system. Compared to traditional IT systems, where one organization has control over the whole

control means both parties now share the responsibilities in providing adequate protections to
the cloud-based systems.”

service level agreement (SLA).45 Service providers handling federal information
or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government must meet
the same security requirements as federal agencies [3]. Therefore, the security cat-
egorization of the information can provide a common understanding of the secu-
rity objectives that drive the selection and compensation of security control
requirements that need to be implemented. The security categorization process
also ensures that service providers have some knowledge of the types of informa-
tion that will be processed, and the potential overall impact to the federal govern-
ment, should certain adverse events occur.
Service providers have a responsibility in maintaining an adequate level of
security to protect the information throughout the service life cycle. However, the
overall responsibility to ensure that sufficient security exists to meet the informa-
tion protection requirements falls on the authorizing official.46 For a chain of trust,
operating under a shared responsibility model, to exist between the federal govern-
ment and service providers, confidence needs to be gained through an understand-
ing of the security controls implemented in the service and its environment. This
confidence is achieved by verifiable and credible evidence that the security con-
trols are operating effectively. Trust becomes even more important under complex
consumerprovider relationships that are introduced such as multivendor situa-
tions. By establishing a clear definition of the security objectives, an analysis47 can
be performed to determine which participant, consumer or provider, would be most
appropriate to implement the necessary security controls based on the differing
degrees of ownership and control over the information system.
Overview of the Security Categorization Process
The goal of the security categorization process is to understand, identify, and
categorize both the information and information systems used to process, store, or
transmit the information, so that an appropriate level of information security can

about the expected level of service to be delivered and, in the event that the provider fails to deliver

be applied. The level of information security is determined, in part, through an
assessment of the potential impact48 to the information in the event that there was
a compromise (e.g., breach of security), which caused a loss in confidentiality,
integrity, or availability. The results of this process enable federal agencies to
understand and communicate their protection requirements as a consequence
(e.g., degradation of primary mission functions or capabilities, financial loss, etc.)
to an adverse impact to their mission and business processes. In addition, by man-
aging the risk at the enterprise level, the information security needs can be
applied more effectively across the federal government by an aggregation of the
sensitivity/criticality of information using a standardized and common language.
This ensures that information systems supporting multiple federal agency mission
areas or supporting federal agencies as a shared business service49 operate based
on the highest level of impact to the federal government.
The security categorization process requires input from across all stakeholders.
For this process to be successful the federal agency needs to ensure that coordina-
tion and collaboration exist among all parties involved (e.g., information owners,
information security practitioners, enterprise architects, capital planning, etc.).
Since the output of this process will be an input to the remaining steps in the
NIST RMF (Steps 26), oversight is critical to ensure any errors can be validated
to prevent or minimize overprotection or potentially increasing organizational risk
by underprotecting the information resources.
Before the categorization process can begin, information to support the catego-
rization process needs to be collected, including the specific organizational-
specific policies, procedures, and other relevant documentation relating to risk
management that would help the organization understand impacts associated with
the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As depicted in Fig. 5.6, the
categorization process is a multistep activity that begins with the identification of
information types and concludes with the assignment of security categories and
impact levels to information and information systems50 that will be used as the
basis for establishing the initial baseline set of security controls.

CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

Identify Information Types
In July 2001, OMB issued Citizen-Centered E-Government: Developing the Action
Plan,51 which established an E-Government Task Force to “identify priority actions
that achieve strategic improvements in government and set in motion a transforma-
tion of government around citizen needs” [9]. The task force published the
E-Government Strategy52 that focused on achieving improvements across multiple
business areas of service within the federal government and reforming the efficiency
and effectiveness of the federal government’s interaction with individual citizens,
businesses, other state and local governments, and even internally within the federal
government itself. As part of the assessment53 performed by the task force, a busi-
ness architecture, shown in Fig. 5.7, was created as a framework to “describe how
the federal government interfaces with citizens, what functions and lines of business
the government performs, and the key business processes used” [9].
As the foundation for the FEA BRM,54 the FEA Program Management Office
(FEAPMO) “leveraged previous Federal architecture efforts, in particular the
business architecture designed as a part of the 2001 e-government Task Force’s
effort, as starting points for designing the government-wide model” [10]. Since its
initial release, the business architecture has been through multiple revisions. The
BRM version 2.0, depicted in Fig. 5.8, reflects four business areas (functions):
services for citizens, mode of delivery, support delivery of services, and manage-
ment of government resources. The BRM is a framework that uses a structured
tiered hierarchical representation for describing the common business areas within
the federal government.
The federal government’s dependence on IT to support various mission and
business functions requires federal agencies to understand the appropriate security
controls that need to be implemented. The security controls are identified through
an assessment of potential impacts should there be a breach of security (i.e., a loss
of confidentiality) [7]. Therefore, the first step in the security categorization process
requires the identification of information types be processed, transmitted, or stored
in the information system. Since the BRM is periodically updated55 to provide a
government-wide view of the various business areas and functions across the

federal government, NIST used the BRM as the basis for the taxonomy of informa-
tion types56 for federal agencies to reference57 when mapping the information types
used in the information system. The integration of the enterprise architecture devel-
oped by the federal agency can provide a useful starting point to ensure the catego-
rization is consistent with the mission and business objectives.
TIP
The types of activities [8] associated with the identification of information types are:
•
Document the agency’s business and mission areas.
•
Identify all of the information types that are input, stored, processed, and/or output from each
system.
•
Identify Mission-based Information Type categories based on supporting FEA Lines of
Business.
•
As applicable, identify Management and Support Information Type categories based on
supporting FEA Lines of Business.
•
Specify applicable subfunctions for the identified Mission-based and Management and Support
categories.
•
As necessary, identify other required information types.
•
Document applicable information types for the identified information system along with the
basis for the information-type selection.
Select Provisional Impact Values for Each Information Type
Once the information types have been identified and documented, the provisional
impact levels need to be selected and assigned to the security objectives of each
information type. The provisional impact levels58 are based on the potential
impacts included in Table 5.2. From the provisional impact levels, an initial secu-
rity categorization is characterized using the following format:
Security Category information type 5 {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability,
impact)}.
56From Stine, K., Kissel, R., Barker, W., Fahlsing, J., Gulick, J. NIST Special Publication (SP)
800-60 Revision 1, Volume I: Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems
to Security Categories. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. NIST
Special Publication (SP) 800-60 (Volume I & II) provides guidelines for agencies to use in catego-
rizing information and information systems by “recommending the types of information and infor-
mation systems to be included in each such category of potential impact.”
57There are instances where information used in an information system may not be captured in the
BRM, which will require federal agencies to conduct additional research when characterizing the
information so that appropriate impact levels can be assigned to the security categories.
58The provisional impact for each information type is documented in Volume II of NIST SP
800-60.
141
NIST RMF Process

NOTE
The types of activities [8] associated with the selection of provisional impact levels are:
•
Select the security impact levels for the identified information types from the recommended
provisional impact levels for each identified information type or from FIPS 199 criteria.
•
Determine the security category (SC) for each information type: SC information
type 5 {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}.
•
Document the provisional impact level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability associated
with the system’s information type.
TIP
The common factors for selecting impact levels include [8]:
•
Confidentiality Factors
•
How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized disclosure of information to do
limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?
(Continued)
Table 5.2 Potential Impact Levels [7]
Potential
Impact
Definition
Low
• The potential impact is low if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on
organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
Moderate
• The potential impact is moderate if the loss of confidentiality, integrity,
or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on
organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
• A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant
degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the
organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the
effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in
significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant
financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does
not involve loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.
High
• The potential impact is high if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse
effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
• A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe
degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration
that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary
functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result
in major financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to
individuals involving loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.
142
CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

TIP (CONTINUED)
•
How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized disclosure of information to gain
control of agency assets that might result in unauthorized modification of information,
destruction of information, or denial of system services that would result in
limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?
•
Would unauthorized disclosure/dissemination of elements of the information type violate
laws, executive orders, or agency regulations?
•
Integrity Factors
•
How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized modification or destruction of
information to do limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals?
•
Would unauthorized modification/destruction of elements of the information type violate
laws, executive orders, or agency regulations?
•
Availability Factors
•
How can a malicious adversary use the disruption of access to or use of information to do
limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?
•
Would disruption of access to or use of elements of the information type violate laws,
executive orders, or agency regulations?
Adjust the Information Type’s Provisioning Impact Value
and Security Category
After the provisional impact levels have been selected, adjustments can be applied
(as required) to the information types using information about the information
system’s environment such as the federal agency’s mission, how the information
will be used, and interfaces with other systems outside of the authorization bound-
ary59 (or information system boundary). Other considerations might also include
special factors specific to each security category as it applies to the organization
or individuals,60 should a specific breach of security occur. When all of the
adjustments to the provisional impact levels have been made for an information
type, the highest impact value from each of the selected security objectives
becomes the overall security categorization for the information type. As an exam-
ple, the security categorization for the following information type would be
Moderate (see Table 5.3).

The final step in the security categorization process is the assignment of
an overall security impact level61 to the information system using the

high-water mark for each of the security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability):
SC System X 5 {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}.

•
Following the agency’s oversight process for reviewing, approving, and documenting all
determinations or decisions.
However, similar to the focus on adjusting security categories for information
types, the system security objectives can also be adjusted, based on the applica-
tion of several factors such as the aggregation of different types of data (change
of the information sensitivity when integrated with other information types) and
critical system functionality (interconnection of the system with other information
systems and the dependence of the information by other information systems to
support a specific mission/business function). In addition, there are other factors
that relate to the specific context of the information and the information system
(e.g., information that would be subject to privacy laws and policies, supporting
infrastructure that stores, processes, or transmits (flows) information within or
across the network or system components).
SECURITY CONTROLS SELECTION
The security control selection is the next step in the NIST RMF (Step 2) and
includes three major tasks, included in Table 5.4. In this section, most of the
focus will be spent on the second and third task. The second task includes
the security control selection process that begins with the initial security
control baseline63 and concludes with a final set of security controls that
will be implemented.64 The third task involves the development of a strategy
to monitor the selected security controls as part of an information security
continuous monitoring (ISCM)65 program.

For legacy information systems (including service providers), a gap analysis [12] can be
performed as follows:
1. Reconfirm (or update) the security categorization;
2. Review the existing security plan (considering any updates to the security categorization); and
3. Implement security controls in the updated security plan with specific attention given to any
new security controls or enhancements.

technical aspects.

“The 17 areas represent a broad-based, balanced information security program that
addresses the management, operational, and technical aspects of protecting federal
information and information systems” [13]. The determination of which requirements
from within each area will be included in the initial security control baseline is based
on the impact level for the information system following the security categorization
process in the NIST RMF (Step 1).
The security control selection process includes multiple steps beginning with the
selection of the initial security control baseline. Once the baseline has been deter-
mined, the next step involves tailoring the initial security control baseline. As illus-
trated in Fig. 5.9, to ensure the resulting security controls required for the information
system achieve cost-effective, risk-based security, and any rationale and tailoring is
an integral part of the organization’s risk management process.67 In addition, any
changes to the baseline needs to be supported by documentation68 that addresses
decisions69 made for adjusting the initial security control baseline such as through an
assessment of risk within the information system and operating environment.
Tailoring the Initial Baseline
The tailoring process involves the customization of the initial security control
baseline.70 This process uses three71 primary mechanisms to adjust the baseline to
more closely align the security control requirements to the actual information sys-
tem and/or operating environment:
•
Scoping considerations—specific considerations on the applicability and
implementation of specific security controls;
•
Compensating security controls—management, operational, and technical
controls implemented in lieu of an identified security controls in the initial
security control baseline;
•

In addition, the concept of overlays72 provides a process for tailoring based on
an organizational-specific set of security controls that have been identified to sup-
plement the baseline for a community-wide use or to address specialized require-

or

(FedRAMP) utilizes the security controls for low- and moderate-impact73 (and
high-impact74) information systems and contains controls and enhancements
above the NIST baseline that addresses the unique elements deemed necessary for
the government-wide use of cloud computing [19].
Applying Scoping Considerations
Scoping ensures that security requirements are identified for providing an ade-
quate level of protection by providing specific security terms and conditions for
addressing the implementation of security controls based on the organization’s
mission and business processes supported by the information system. In addition,
the application of scoping considerations75 can ensure that security controls are
cost-effectively and efficiently applied by eliminating unnecessary security con-
trols. There are several scoping considerations that can be applied when adjusting
the initial security control baseline to the environment of operation:
•
Use of common controls;76
•
Downgrading security controls for those that do not uniquely attribute to
high-water mark for the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or
availability);

•
Allocation and placement of security controls applicable to specific
information system components;
•
Removal of security controls that are technology-dependent;
•
Application of security control for those areas that support the physical
infrastructure used to provide direct protection;
•
Employment of security controls based on the laws, directives, policies, and so
on that govern the information types and the information system;
•
Employment of security controls that are consistent with the assumption about
the operational environment;
•
Implementation of security controls based on the scalability associated with
the specific impact level; and
•
Application of security controls where public access is granted.
Selecting Compensating Security Controls
Compensation is the function of implementing one or more security controls as
an alternative to a security control in the initial security control baseline.
Although there are many circumstances that could occur where compensation
would be required, the most important aspect of using compensation is to have a
clear understanding of the risks associated with not implementing the recom-
mended security control. The compensating security control(s) should provide, at
minimum, a comparable level of protection and mitigate any risk introduced
through the removal of the control from the initial security control baseline.
NOTE
Compensating controls should only be employed if [12]:
•
The organization selects the compensating control from NIST Special Publication 80053, or
if an appropriate compensating control is not available, the organization adopts a
suitable compensating control from another source;
•
The organization provides supporting rationale for how the compensating control delivers an
equivalent security capability for the information system and why the related baseline security
control could not be employed; and
•
The organization assesses and formally accepts the risk associated with employing the
compensating control in the information system.
Assigning Security Control Parameter Values
Organization-defined parameters are included in portions of security controls to
offer flexibility in the implementation. The parameters enable the security control
requirements to be completed with specific values that could come from within
the organization or as prescribed by federal laws, executive orders, directives, and
policies that govern the type of information or information system, or other
sources such as industry “best practices.” In situations where the prescribed para-
meters are more restrictive, they should be applied to the maximum extent
153
NIST RMF Process

possible. In addition, if there are variations to recommended parameters, the dif-
ferences should be documented to ensure that the organization has some under-
standing of the risk and can apply the necessary compensating controls to
mitigate risks that are determined to be unacceptable.
Supplementing the Tailored Baseline
Once the initial baseline has been tailored (if necessary), the tailored baseline (or initial
baseline if no tailoring was performed) should be reviewed to ensure that it provides
the adequate protection and any identified organization risk77 that exists is mitigated.
Enhancing security control baselines by selecting additional security controls or sup-
plementing the baseline security controls with enhancements can occur due to specific
situations such as advanced persistent threat, cross-domain services, mobility, classi-
fied and sensitive information. There may also be situations where security controls
cannot be sufficiently applied, requiring alternative strategies by placing restrictions78
on the use of the information systems and specific information technologies.
Identifying additional security controls can be accomplished through the
definition of requirements or conducting a gap analysis. Requirements definition
involves an evaluation of the risk assessment to establish requirements through an
analysis of threat information or attack potential. Whereas, a gap analysis focuses
on characterizing the security requirements through an assessment of the existing
security capabilities and determining the types of threats79 that can likely be pre-
vented. As an example, Fig. 5.10 provides an illustration of the framework in
which “effectively withstand cyber attacks from adversaries with the stated
capabilities or attack potential, organizations strive to achieve a certain level of
defensive capability or cyber preparedness”80 [12]. However, in either approach,

ate- or high-impact information on organizational information system components to which the
public has access, unless an explicit risk determination is made authorizing such access.”

tions to ensure a commensurate level of security capabilities exists to defend against an attack. NIST

threat taxonomy that can be used as a starting point for building a tailored list of threat sources.
154
CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

the goal is to use the information from the analysis to identify security controls
and/or enhancements, which will be required to attain the appropriate level of
preparedness.
Documenting the Tailoring and Supplementation Process
The rationale for the decisions made throughout the tailoring and supplementation
process resulting in an adjustment to the initial security control baseline should be
documented. Table 5.6 provides an example of the type of information that should
be used when tailoring the security control baseline and for determining if any
impacts would occur to a federal agency’s mission or business based on the changes
in the security control baseline. In addition, the information documented could be
used by the authorizing official to make a credible, risk-based decision as part of the
authorization step of the NIST RMF (Step 5). This information is also important for
understanding any risk-based decisions that were made so they can be evaluated if
any changes occur during the monitoring step of the NIST RMF (Step 6).

step, the strategy focuses on defining “how changes to the information system
will be monitored and how the security impact analyses will be conducted” [3].
In addition, the strategy includes the identification of any volatile security con-
trols and the frequency at which those security controls should be monitored over
time. This also requires establishing the approach for conducting assessments
(e.g., automated techniques and tools such as Secure Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP),83 architectures to support dynamic monitoring and reporting
such as the Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational, Awareness, and Risk
Scoring (CAESARS)84 Framework Extension (FE),85 and manual assessments).

allocated to the information system and interfaces between interconnected systems.
This boundary definition activity is critical for fully understanding and clarifying
any shared roles and responsibilities for implementing, monitoring, and assessing
security controls allocated87 as part of the security control selection process.
However, clarifying roles and responsibilities is not only important as it relates to
establishing the ownership of the security controls, but can also help with determin-
ing the security-related information that needs to be shared when communicating88
between security control owners. Although only a conceptual model, Fig. 5.11 does
provide a high-level illustration of the potential flow of information when allocating
security controls, and when assigning ownership for common capabilities that sup-
port more than one information system (i.e., common controls or portions of controls
in a hybrid controls situation). In addition, establishing a definition of the authoriza-
tion boundary and the level of control of the resources can provide a clear delineation
of the specific security controls being inherited such as system components that may
be used by an organization, but may be outside the direct control of the authorizing
official. For security control allocation to be successful, in most cases it requires
building trusted relationships based on the sharing of evidence that specific security
controls are implemented correctly and operating effectively, including any assess-
ment results (or a summary) and information collected as part of an ongoing continu-
ous monitoring program. The sharing of information ensures changes that could
impact the information system inheriting the common controls (or hybrid portions)
are understood and any identified risks through the risk management process can be
accepted or mitigated through the application of compensating controls.
Decomposition
Decomposition enables complex information systems and security controls to be
allocated among more manageable subsystems,89 thereby enabling subsystems to

may not reside within the information system but only at a specific point in the
information system life cycle. In other cases, the subsystems may be controlled and
managed by a service provider outside of the authorization boundary or outside of
the control of the organization. In these situations, establishing subsystems enables
parts of the information system that are more volatile or not within the control of
the federal agency or service provider to be monitored differently based on the
federal agency’s assurance requirements to ensure that required security controls
continue to operate at an acceptable level of risk over time.
SECURITY CONTROLS IMPLEMENTATION
In this step of the NIST RMF (Step 3), both the tasks included in Table 5.7 will
be covered together due to their close relationship (i.e., implementation of the
security controls and documentation of their implementation may occur concur-
rently). To enable the efficient and cost-effective implementation of security con-
trols,

system during the security control selection process. In addition, the allocation of
security controls should be based on “best practices” focused on identifying specific
system components for providing a security capability. Documenting the security
control implementation in the security plan provides a functional description of the
security controls (i.e., planned inputs, expected behavior, and expected outputs) both
from an organizational perspective (management and operational security controls)
and a system perspective (operational and technical security controls). In addition,
the security plan documents a description of any inheritance (common security con-
trols), shared ownership (hybrid security controls), and the system-specific security
controls allocated to system components within the information system boundary.
The level of detail for documenting security controls implementation should
commensurate with the impact level assigned to the information system, but should
at least provide traceability of decisions prior to and after deployment of the
information system and be sufficient to support control assessment [3].
Implementing and Documenting Security Controls
As discussed earlier in the chapter, the integration of security early in the SDLC
enables architects and engineers to integrate security controls into the information
security architecture93 by applying overlapping, defense-in-depth protective
layers,94 through the use of security engineering principles,95 and secure coding
methodologies.96 Additionally, the implementation of risk management activities
(e.g., development testing and evaluation97) ensures that information security
planning is performed in parallel with the information system development to
identify any weaknesses and deficiencies that will need to be mitigated, thereby
maximizing the reuse of the assessment results in later phases of the SDLC and
achieving a more cost-effective balance between the implementation of security
controls and the management of risk. In addition, security control allocation, both
93In a legacy information system, a “gap analysis” can be used to understand any limitation in the
existing information security architecture where security controls are not functioning properly so
that corrective actions can be planned and compensating controls can be identified to provide ade-
quate protection for any unacceptable risks.

between the security control owners (e.g., common control providers) and infor-
mation system components, requires identifying any dependencies from the secu-
rity control selection process. This activity is essential to ensure that any changes
to the planned security controls resulting from the infeasibility or impracticability
of their implementation, can be updated in the security plan documentation to
capture any risk-based decision-making and accurately describe compensating
security controls that will be implemented to minimize the impact associated with
unacceptable risks.
NOTE
What is the purpose of the system security plan?
“The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements
of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who
access the system. The system security plan should be viewed as documentation of the structured
process of planning adequate, cost-effective security protection for a system” [3].
SECURITY CONTROLS ASSESSMENT
The security controls implemented and documented in the previous steps are
essential components for conducting an effective assessment.98 The security
controls assessment step in the NIST RMF (Step 4) involves the preparation,
execution, and reporting of the security controls effectiveness in the informa-
tion system. This section will summarize the assessment-related tasks in
Table 5.8. The assessment tasks are dependent on the close collaboration and
cooperation of the security assessor99 and the organization to ensure that there
is an appropriate level of depth100 and coverage101applied when evaluating

requirements.102
Assessment Preparation
Prior to beginning the assessment activities, expectations should be appropriately
set through the development of a security assessment plan (SAP). Preparatory
activities should be planned together, by the organization undergoing the assess-
ment and the provider conducting the assessment, to limit any unexpected issues
and to gain a clear understanding of the level of effort required. Fig. 5.12 pro-
vides an example list of preparatory activities that guide the completion of the
assessment plan. In addition, the organization should also provide the security
assessor with the following types of information:
•
Organizational chart (or description of organizational personnel responsible
for security policies and procedures);
•
Policies and procedures that relate to the information system;
•
Organizational chart (or description of organizational personnel responsible
for security control implementation); and
•

Security Assessment Plan
Planning activities are critical for the success of the security assessment.
The SAP,103 developed by the security assessor, should be reviewed and
approved by the organization based on an agreement of what is in scope for
the assessment. Similar to Step 2, where the organization selects, tailors, and
supplements security controls to be implemented, the security assessor should
also perform similar activities by selecting, tailoring, and supplementing
assessment procedures that address specific assurance requirements by the
organization.
TIP
Select, Tailor, Customize, Optimize
As a guide, and to improve the effectiveness in executing assessments, an assessor should
seek to find ways to save time and money when conducting assessments through the following
steps [16]:
•
Select assessment methods104 and objects that match the assurance requirements.
•
Select the appropriate depth and coverage attributes.105
•
Identify common controls to reduce redundancy and duplication of effort.
•
Customize security-specific assessment procedures to closely match the operating environment
(and utilizing supplemental guidance in the NIST Security Controls Catalog to establish an
intent of the security control).
•
Identify assessment results that are applicable for reuse (previous assessments) or through
more efficiency in sequencing the current assessment.
•
Adjust assessment procedures to accommodate external service providers based on contracts
or service-level agreements.
•
Develop assessment procedures106 for custom security controls.
•
Identify areas where assessment procedures can be combined and consolidated to maximize
cost savings without compromising quality.

CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

Assessing Security Controls
Conducting security assessments,107 which will be discussed in more detail in later
chapters, is described briefly in this section. The security assessment execution is
primarily organized and executed by the security assessor, with the organization’s
support. Therefore, the key focus will be on making the assurance case.108
When conducting the security assessment, the security assessor needs to obtain
evidence109 to facilitate the security assessor in making an objective determina-
tion of security control effectiveness, based on the criteria (i.e., expect input,
behavior, and outcome) identified in the assessment procedures. Since the key
focus will be on making the assurance case, the evidence should come directly
from the information system or operating environment, or from a third-party eval-
uation of the product or technology such as a common criteria evaluation.110 In
addition, automated tools and techniques could be used to improve the quality of
the security assessment through an increase in the sampling size and coverage.
Reporting Assessment Results
Reporting on the security control assessment results, including any issues,
weaknesses and deficiencies, and recommendations, is performed through the
security assessment report (SAR).111 The SAR works together with the security
plan (including risk assessment) and POA&Ms to provide an overall picture of
the security state and risk posture for the information system. The specific
reporting format for security assessment results is organizationally dependent,
but should provide enough detail to enable the authorizing official to establish
a credible, risk-based decision. In addition to findings, the SAR also includes
key recommendations for addressing the findings.112 Evidence produced during

controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system.”

used by the authorizing official to make an authorization decision.

initial reports of findings of a “delta” could be resolved during the information system development.

CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

Corrective Action Planning
The POA&Ms115 receive input from the SAR116, and is one of three key docu-
ments presented in the authorization package to the authorizing official. The
POA&Ms include a set of tasks focused on correcting weaknesses or deficiencies
discovered during the security controls assessment,117 or security testing (e.g.,
periodic vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, etc.). In addition, POA&Ms
document corrective actions for security weaknesses and deficiencies found dur-
ing other types of reviews done by, for, or on behalf of the federal agency, includ-
ing Government Accountability Office (GAO) audits, financial system audits, and
critical infrastructure vulnerability assessments [17].
Developing a Risk Mitigation Strategy
A strategy for risk mitigation118 planning is important when prioritizing corrective
actions as part of an organization-wide risk management function. The prioritiza-
tion119 should take input from other activities within the NIST RMF, such as
security categorization. In addition, other inputs can also influence the risk miti-
gation strategy, such as the security controls (i.e., where the security weaknesses
or deficiencies exist), impacts of the weaknesses and deficiencies on the overall
security state of the information system, and the risk mitigation approach used by
the organization to address weaknesses and deficiencies [3].

Documenting POA&Ms
The authorizing official uses POA&Ms as an oversight management tool
for tracking corrective actions for a specific information system. In addition,
the organization can also use consolidated POA&Ms from across all of
the information system to identify common weaknesses and deficiencies to
effectively allocate resources for organization-wide security improvements.
Therefore, POA&Ms should provide enough details120 to enable the organiza-
tion to identify, assess, prioritize, and monitor the correction of weaknesses
and deficiencies both in federal and contractor systems.121 POA&M details122
should include:
•
Brief description of the weakness.123
•
Identity of the organization held responsible for resolving the weakness.
•
Estimated funding resources required to resolve the weakness.
•
Scheduled completion date for resolving the weakness.
•
Key milestones124 with completion dates.
•
Milestone changes.
•

CHAPTER 5 Applying the NIST risk management framework

Security Authorization Approaches
The security authorization process is based on three different approaches.126 The
first, and most commonly used, is the traditional approach, which involves only
one authorizing official. In this approach, a single authorizing official has both
the responsibility and accountability for accepting security risks. Next is the joint
authorization127 approach, which includes a shared interest, usually between
multiple authorizing officials because the information system ties directly into the
strategic mission or business processes. In this approach, the authorizing officials
are collectively responsible and accountable for accepting the security risks.
The final approach is used when the mission or business processes are supported
by more than one federal agency. This approach is known as the leveraged authoriza-
tion approach and can be used to authorize an information system, commonly a shared
service,128 that can be used by more than one agency based on the original authoriza-
tion package without requiring reauthorization by the leveraging organization.
Owing to the complexity in implementing the leveraged authorization
approach, it is the one used least often of the three, but offers the most cost
savings.129 The leveraging organization, usually through an assigned authorizing
official, leverages the original authorization130 by accepting the risks, and
126From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and
Technology; 2010. “Organizations can choose from three different approaches when planning for and
conducting security authorizations to include: (i) an authorization with a single authorizing official;
(ii) an authorization with multiple authorizing officials; or (iii) leveraging an existing authorization.”

Publication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to

controls, plan for assessing the controls to determine effectiveness, plan of action and milestones,
and continuous monitoring strategy, is necessary for a successful joint authorization.”

for significant cost savings and avoids a potentially costly and time-consuming authorization

Publication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to
Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of
Standards and Technology; 2010. “When reviewing the authorization package, the leveraging orga-
nization considers risk factors such as the time elapsed since the authorization results were pro-
duced, the environment of operation (if different from the environment of operation reflected in the
authorization package), the criticality/sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or
transmitted, as well as the overall risk tolerance of the leveraging organization.”
169
NIST RMF Process

assesses only those additional requirements beyond the original security control
baseline established by the original.131 For example, if the leveraging organization
determines that there is insufficient information in the authorization package or
inadequate security measures in place for establishing an acceptable level of risk,
the leveraging organization may negotiate for additional security measures132
and/or security-related information [3].
Another option that may be used by an organization when multiple instances
of the same information system (or subsystem) are deployed in a number of
different operational environments is the application of a type authorization [3].
In a type authorization a single authorizing package is used to reflect a common
view for all of the instances deployed across all locations where the information
system is hosted (also known as site-specific controls133).
Security Authorization Process
The security authorization process is the most involved step in the NIST RMF
(Step 5) because it requires the direct or indirect input from each of the previous
steps in the NIST RMF (categorization, security control selection, security con-
trol implementation, and security control assessment) to make the authorization
decision. This process begins with the assembly of the authorization package,
where the key and supporting documents needed to make the authorization deci-
sion are prepared. After the security authorization package has been assembled,
the determination of risk involves an analysis of information gathered from across
the organization to provide the authorizing official with enough credible informa-
tion to support a risk-based decision.
The authorization package includes both key and supporting documents.134
Fig. 5.13 illustrates the three key minimum documents that are required by the

authorizing official: security plan, SAR, and POA&Ms. These three documents
are considered the most accurate representation of the security state of the infor-
mation system and are based on the information derived from activities performed
throughout the execution of the NIST RMF.
For security controls inherited in whole or in part by another organization
(common control provider) or an external service provider, security risk-
related information135 may be shared with the authorizing official to supple-
ment the authorization package and assist in making an authorization decision.
For all of the key documents included in the authorization package, the owner
of the information system or provider of common controls generally has
the responsibility of the packaging and submitting the security authorization
package.
Risk determination is a critical activity in the authorization process that
involves reviewing the documents in the security authorization package. During
this activity, the authorizing official will likely place significant importance on
the security assessment report [3], but will also use information gathered through
other risk management activities to understand the organization’s overall risk
exposure136 from operating the information system. In addition, the authorizing
official will likely rely upon additional input from the other parts of the

NIST RMF, with mission and operational needs for the information system [3].
The security considerations are based on the contents of the authorization
package, input from the risk executive, and any other supporting information as
determined by the authorizing official.
After the final authorization decision has been made, the decision is communi-
cated to the system owner or common controls provider. The authorization decision
document includes not only the authorization decision, but may also include any
applicable terms and conditions138 and a termination date. As an alternative, instead
of establishing a termination date (time-drive reauthorizations139), the organization
could also require the implementation of a continuous monitoring program (event-
driven reauthorization140) that provides the capability to continuously make risk
determinations and acceptance. For example, “if the maximum authorization period
for an information system is three years, then an organization establishes a continu-
ous monitoring strategy for assessing a subset of the security controls employed
within and inherited by the system during the authorization period. This strategy
allows all security controls designated in the respective security plans to be
assessed at least one time by the end of the three-year period” [3].

NIST RMF Process

NOTE (CONTINUED)
No. Rather than enforcing a static, three-year reauthorization process, agencies are expected to
conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems through the implementation of
continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs thus fulfill the three-year
security reauthorization requirement, so a separate reauthorization process is not necessary.
In an effort to implement a more dynamic, risk-based security authorization process, agencies
should follow the guidance in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Revision 1. Agencies should
develop and implement continuous monitoring strategies for all information systems. Agency
officials should monitor the security state of their information systems on an ongoing basis with
a frequency sufficient to make ongoing risk-based decisions on whether to continue to operate
the systems within their organizations. Continuous monitoring programs and strategies should
address: (i) the effectiveness of deployed security controls; (ii) changes to information systems
and the environments in which those systems operate; and (iii) compliance to federal
legislation, directives, policies, standards, and guidance with regard to information security
and risk management. Agencies will be required to report the security state of their information
systems and results of their ongoing authorizations through CyberScope in accordance with the
data feeds defined by DHS.
Organizational information systems may move from a static, point-in-time authorization
process to a dynamic, near real-time ongoing authorization process when the following
conditions are satisfied [20]:
•
Condition 1—In accordance with the RMF, the information system has been granted an initial
authorization to operate by the AO as a result of a complete, zero-base review of the system
and has entered the operations/maintenance phase of the system development life cycle.
•
Condition 2—An organizational ISCM program is in place that monitors all implemented
security controls with the appropriate degree of rigor and at the appropriate frequencies
specified by the organization in accordance with the ISCM strategy and NIST guidance.
For an ongoing authorization142 to be successful,143 the continuous monitoring
program needs to integrate information security and risk management into the
organization’s SDLC. The continuous monitoring NIST RMF (Step 6) is aligned
with the NIST SDLC operations and maintenance (O&M) phase. The application
of configuration management and control policies and procedures identifies

of the information system (including the effectiveness of the security controls employed within and inher-
ited by the system) to determine whether continued operation is acceptable based on ongoing risk deter-
minations, and if not, which step or steps in the Risk Management Framework needs to be re-executed

effectiveness. In addition, the use of automation also supports the concept of
“near real-time” ongoing authorizations.144
If a management-driven continuous monitoring strategy is applied during the
continuous monitoring step, the authorization decision can be streamlined. For
example, if reauthorization actions result in either a time-driven (termination
date) or event-driven (significant change145) trigger, and information produced as
a result of the ongoing assessment activities continued to demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of the security controls, the only action required for reauthorization
might include making updates to the original authorization package and resubmis-
sion to the authorizing official for risk acceptance.
SECURITY CONTROLS MONITORING
The final step in NIST RMF (Step 6) focuses on those activities that support the
ongoing authorization of the information system. Through the integration of risk
management in an organization-wide ISCM program, the security state can be
monitored on an ongoing basis. The discussion on development and mainte-
nance of an ISCM program and on specific types of tools, techniques, and tech-
nologies will be presented in more detail in later chapters. Therefore, this
section limits the discussion to cover only those activities included in
Table 5.11 as they relate to the continuous assessment of security controls and
updates to risk management documents to support the ongoing risk determina-
tion, mitigation, and acceptance.
Managing information risk on an ongoing basis requires a rigorous organiza-
tional continuous monitoring146 strategy and program designed to maintain a secu-
rity authorization over an extended period of time. Continuous monitoring is a
concept in which the security impacts to changes in the information system and the

security impact analyses, the organization can also use automated tools to pro-
vide security status-related information to organizational officials in “near
real-time” in order to assist the authorizing official in making cost-effective,
risk-based decisions regarding the use and operation of the information system.
Through a disciplined approach to continuous monitoring, the organization can
more efficiently determine the affects on changes to the security state of the
information system and the necessary corrective actions and/or risk mitigations
that need to be put in place.
TIP
An effective organization-wide continuous monitoring program [3] includes:
•
Configuration management and control processes.
•
Security impact analyses on proposed or actual changes.
•
Assessment of selected security controls.
•
Security status reporting.
•
Active involvement by authorizing officials.
Determining Security Impact
Over time, information systems can be susceptible to changes. The application of
configuration management and control processes147 requires documenting148 and
assessing the impact149 on changes (proposed or actual). The assessment of the
impact to the security state of the information throughout the SDLC is an impor-
tant part of maintaining an ongoing security authorization. However, not all

changes (e.g., routine changes or scheduled maintenance) will impact the security
state of the information system or the environment. Through a consistent applica-
tion of configuration management and controls processes similar to Fig. 5.14, all
changes going through the continuous monitoring process will be required to
undergo an assessment of risk to support an ongoing authorization based on an
understanding of the impacts to those changes.
Ongoing Security Controls Assessments
The monitoring strategy is developed during the security control selection step of
the NIST RMF (Step 2). The strategy is focused on establishing criteria150 for
selecting which security controls employed within or inherited by the information
system should be monitored as part of the continuous monitoring program. The
determination of which security controls to assess and the frequency of monitor-
ing requires obtaining input from a variety of sources [3] to include:
•
Risk assessments (including current threat and vulnerability information),
•
History of cyber attacks,
•
Results of previous security assessments, and
•
Operational requirements.
In addition, factors such as security control volatility151 and POA&Ms152 can
also be useful. For example, “security controls that are subject to the direct effects
or side effects of frequent changes in hardware, software, and/or firmware compo-
nents of an information system would, therefore, likely be controls with higher
volatility” [3].
The continuous assessments of security controls identified for ongoing moni-
toring could produce weaknesses or deficiencies in addition to those discovered
during the initial security authorization process. These corrective actions (and

and the Nation.”

discussed in the NIST RMF (Step 5), including updates in the POA&Ms.154
Key Updates and Status Reporting
During continuous monitoring, results of security control assessments modifica-
tions to security control implementations, or changes to the information system
may require updates to key documents in the authorization package.155 Fig. 5.12
provides recommendations on when potential updates may be required for each
document to support the ongoing authorization of the information system or to
facilitate near real-time risk management.
On an ongoing basis, results of the continuous monitoring activities are
reported to the authorizing official by the system owner (or common controls pro-
vider). The frequency of updates through security status reports may be based on
the monitoring strategy, and could occur more frequently when significant
changes occur to the information system or significant deficiencies156 (or material
weaknesses) are identified (see Table 5.12).
Ongoing Risk Determination and Acceptance
The status update reports by the system owner (or common controls provider) are
reviewed by the authorizing official on an ongoing basis. The status reports are
coordinated with the organization’s senior information security officer and the
risk executive that provide input to the authorizing official in determining if the

risk to the information system continues to be acceptable. The use of automated
tools can assist in capturing, maintaining, and presenting (i.e., quantifying and
visually displaying) security status information to support “near real-time” risk
management, by communicating the overall risk posture. If automation is not
available, a summary of the key changes to the documents included in the autho-
rization package should be used by the authorizing official to understand and
determine if changes would affect the original authorization decision (i.e., affects
on the mission or business) for using and operating the information system.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, FISMA was introduced as a basis for understanding the key
requirements for federal information security programs, including the roles and
responsibilities for managing information security risks. The implementation of
FISMA requires the application of organization-wide risk management activity.
The management of risk is a complex and multifaceted activity requiring risks to
be addressed at the strategic and tactical levels, and through different viewpoints.
Integrating risk management into the organization’s SDLC will result in the con-
sistent application of risk management processes and procedures. Although this
chapter limited the discussion of risk management process and decision making at
the organizational level (which will be covered in the next chapter), the NIST
RMF and related risk management and security tasks were covered in detail for
managing risks from an information system perspective.

The role of risk management within the federal government has evolved from
focusing primarily on the assessment of risk1 associated within a single informa-

threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and is typically a function of: (i) the adverse
impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.”

the organization.4 By recognizing that organizations5 are operating in highly com-
plex, interconnected environments using state-of-the-art and legacy information
systems [1], the application of the risk management process becomes more impor-
tant to ensure the responsibility for information security risk management exists
as an organization-wide activity. This organization-wide activity extends from
those responsible for the strategic planning to those that operate the information
systems in support of the mission and business operations. In Chapter 5, Applying
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management
Framework (RMF), risk management was discussed from the perspective of the
information system through the NIST RMF6 to integrate risk management activi-
ties into the NIST system development life cycle (SDLC).7 Risk management in
this chapter will examine risk management from a broader perspective. By dis-
cussing risk management as a holistic process that can include multiple perspec-
tives (i.e., organization, mission and business process, and information system),
we can obtain an understanding of how it would be applied across the entire orga-
nization or across multiple organizations.
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is facilitated through the organization’s
risk management processes8 to ensure that the management of risk is applied

consistently across the enterprise. An ERM program is integrated across the orga-
nization through a comprehensive set of processes and practices that focus on
managing organizational risk.9 For risk management to be effective in managing
security risks, it is essential that those with the responsibility for executing the
mission and business operations have a clear understanding of their associated
roles and responsibilities within the information security program.
An effective risk management program is driven from a “top-down” approach
where the commitment and support for the program is enabled through the priori-
tization and allocation of resources needed for the program. In addition to resour-
cing risk management, the risk management strategy needs to be developed and
communicated by the organization’s senior management to ensure that the risk
management processes and practices are supported by the governance structure
that links information system security risks to organizational impacts.10 The orga-
nization’s senior management/executives play a critical role to ensure that infor-
mation security risks are considered from an organizational perspective. Their
role includes [1]:
•
Assigning risk management responsibilities;
•
Recognizing and understanding that management of information security risks
is an ongoing activity;
•
Establishing and communicating the risk tolerance11 throughout the
organization; and
•
Ensuring accountability for risk management decisions and effective,
organization-wide risk management programs.

Introduction to Risk Management

FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT
PRACTICES
Risk management is not a new concept within the federal government. As early
as 1974, guidelines have been developed to support federal agencies in integrating
risk management practices into federal security programs. For example, the
National Bureau of Standards (NBS)12 published the Guidelines for Automatic
Data Processing Physical Security and Risk Management for the purpose of
assisting automatic data processing (ADP) facility managers in developing physi-
cal security programs. These guidelines provided procedures for risk manage-
mentrelated activities such as conducting a risk analysis (risk assessment) and
the selection and implementation of security measures (risk mitigation). This
early risk management philosophy became the foundations by which federal
information security programs were built.13 As chronicled in Table 6.1, over the

Federal Information Security Risk Management Practices

years, the federal government’s viewpoint on risk management has changed,
requiring the practices to evolve from a tactical to a strategic focus.
Risk management practices are a critical part of federal information security
that requires addressing continuous changes in the sophistication and complexity
of the threat environment. In the past, federal agencies have been required to rely
upon only risk assessments as a tool for integrating risk management activities
within their certification and accreditation (C&A)14 processes [10] (also referred
to security assessment and authorization) and as the foundation15 for managing
risks within their information security programs. However, federal risk manage-
ment processes are maturing. By adopting a government-wide approach, federal
risk management programs are becoming more comprehensive through the use of
continuous monitoring tools and techniques to gather security-related information
to manage risks. Therefore, throughout the remainder of this chapter, the focus
will shift to discussing a holistic, enterprise perspective to managing risk and the
role of risk management in supporting a government-wide approach to security
assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring.

CHAPTER 6 Risk management

OVERVIEW OF ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Enterprise-wide risk management consists of a structured approach for consistently
and continuously applying risk management practices for managing risk16 beyond
the information system boundary. By examining the components that make up the
federal government’s viewpoint of an organization-wide risk management program,
a model can be established that will be useful for integrating these components into
existing federal government and private sector risk management programs. As pre-
viously discussed, risk management within the federal government has primarily
focused on managing risk at the information system level. This system level
approach is not adequate when risks need to be communicated across the different
levels of the organization or between multiple organizations. For risk management
to be effective as a strategic and tactical tool used by the organization(s) in making
risk decisions, they need to be able to manage risk across the complex environ-
ments in which information systems operate. In this section, an overview will be
provided of the integrated, enterprise-wide risk management17 methodology, and
how it is applied in the context of the organization(s)18 supported by the informa-
tion system. In addition, to provide a broader context, the next section will include
a brief comparison of both the practices and processes used in the federal govern-
ment and in the private sector using international risk management standards.
COMPONENTS OF THE NIST RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

vide a structured, process-oriented approach for managing risks. Each of the four

uous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations.”

components of the risk management process ensures that risk is managed in an
integrated process that requires the involvement of the entire organization.
Historically, the federal government included only two of the four components of
risk management—risk assessment and risk response. In this approach to risk
management, as illustrated in Fig. 6.1, two additional components have been
added: risk framing and risk monitoring.
Risk Framing
Establishing a risk context (or framing) is a critical first step in risk management
that requires describing the risk environment. The environment includes risk
assumptions,20 risk constraints,21 risk tolerance,22 priorities/trade-offs,23 and the

trust model.24 Framing the risk can also include information about any tools or
techniques that are used by the organization to support the risk management activ-
ities. The output of risk framing is a risk management strategy25 that provides the
organization with a common perspective for managing risks (i.e., assessment,
response, or monitoring).
Risk Assessment
The assessment of risk is based on the organization’s risk context, and includes
activities focused on supporting the identification and determination of risk, and
monitoring risk factors.26 Risks are identified based on a characterization of
threats27 (threat sources and events), vulnerabilities,28 and predisposing condi-
tions.29 The risk determination is based on the impact that would result from an
event and the likelihood the event would occur. Monitoring risk factors is the
maintenance aspect, and includes an ongoing situational awareness of the changes
to information used by the organization when making a risk-based decision.
A risk assessment is a tool that can be used organization-wide. Depending on the
organizational structure, risk-related information captured at the strategic level (tier 1),
as illustrated in Fig. 6.2, can be used at the tactical level (tier 3). By conducting risk
24Trust models can be formed through evidence-based assurance (validated trust), historical rela-
tionships (direct historical trust), third-party assurance (mediated trust), authoritative organizations
(mandate trust), or any combination (hybrid trust) of the previous trust models for one organization
to obtain the necessary level of trust of the security/risk activities of another organization.

193
Overview of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management

assessments as a continual risk management activity, threats, vulnerability, likelihood,
and impact information can be refined and updated with information at each of the
three levels within the organization (governance, mission/business process, and infor-
mation system). However, to effectively integrate risk assessments at the different
levels within the organization, the involvement in the risk assessment activities must
extend beyond those responsible for information security. By using an organizational
approach to conduct risk assessments, information security risks become an integral
part of the organization’s overall decision-making process.
Risk Response
After risks have been identified and analyzed, the organization focuses on devel-
oping responses30 to risk. When responding to risks, the organization needs to
ensure that the response is consistent with the risk context defined in the risk
framing component of risk management. Depending on the level of the organiza-
tion, the risk response may be different due to the types of risk-related informa-
tion being evaluated for impact and the specific interpretation of the risk
management strategy. For example:
•
The focus of risk response at the strategic, organizational level might focus on
the actions (e.g., accept risk, avoid risk, and transfer risk) that would be
available to the organization based on the risk framing.

purpose of the risk response component is to provide a consistent, organization-wide, response to
risk in accordance with the organizational risk frame by: (i) developing alternative courses of
action for responding to risk; (ii) evaluating the alternative courses of action; (iii) determining
appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational risk tolerance; and (iv) implementing
risk responses based on selected courses of action.”
194
CHAPTER 6 Risk management

•
Risk responses from the perspective of the mission/business process owners
might consider impacts on the ability of the specific organization to
accomplish a specific business function that could result in changes to the
information security architecture or processes that support the information
security program.
•
Risk response at the tactical, information system level might focus on specific
tasks (plans of action and milestones) that would be undertaken to correct any
weaknesses or deficiencies found in security controls to ensure that the
system-level risk can be mitigated to an acceptable level.
A key part of risk response that cannot be overlooked is how the responses to
risk are communicated outside of the organization such as with external service
providers (or even between organizations) who may share some or all of the risks.
This may require those service providers (or organizations) to be part of the risk
response decision-making process, specifically if it relates to contractual or
service-level obligations that have already been established and formalized prior
to the risk response decisions.
Risk Monitoring
The purpose of risk monitoring is to address how risk will be monitored. This
includes verifying compliance with the risk response decisions by ensuring that
the organization implements the risk response measures (and any information
security requirements), determines the ongoing effectiveness of risk response
measures, and identifies any changes that would impact the risk posture [1]. Risk
monitoring activities at the various levels of the organization (or with other orga-
nizational entities) should be coordinated and communicated. This can include
sharing risk assessment results that would have an organization-wide impact to
risk responses being planned or implemented. The organization should also con-
sider the tools and technologies that will be needed to facilitate monitoring and
the frequency necessary for effectively monitoring risks, including the changes
that would impact responses to risks.
MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT
Most organizations, regardless of the size or type, have a similar structure that
includes executive leadership (addressing risk as it relates to the organization’s
mission and business functions), mission and business management (addressing
risk as it relates to the organization’s operations), and system management
(addressing risk as it relates to the security controls). As illustrated in Fig. 6.2,
the integration of the risk management process focuses on the risk management
activities31 at each tier.
31Activities related to framing risk, assessing risk, responding to risk, and monitoring risk executed
at each tier within the context of the organization’s governance structure and risk management
program.
195
Overview of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management

The information flow between the organizational tiers should be bi-directional.
By offering a feedback loop, results of monitoring activities can be shared between
organizational tiers at each level within the governance structure (or model32). For
example, tier 3 outputs can be used by tier 2 to improve policies, procedures, and
practices, and tier 2 outputs can be used to by tier 1 to improve organizational poli-
cies that govern the risk management program and are articulated through the risk
management strategy. Not only is the information flow important for the facilitation
of internal risk-related information, it can also serve to communicate information
from external sources (e.g., peer organizations, service providers) that may improve
the strategy to ensure that it is comprehensive.
Tier 1 Risk Management Activities
The organization’s governance33 structure and practices are generally developed
from a “top-down” approach. This ensures that the organizational governance (i.e.,
responsibilities and practices) addresses risk from an organizational viewpoint that
is consistent with the strategic goals and objectives. In addition, risk management
process should be directed from the senior management (head of a federal agency,
corporate executive, etc.) to align the risk decision with the organization’s strategic
direction. Senior management may also have the overall responsibility for oversee-
ing the achievement of the business objectives and thus they may have the ability
to ensure that resources are available and used effectively to manage risk.
NOTE
Five potential outcomes of the governance-related risk management activities [1] include:
•
Strategic alignment of risk management decisions consistent with the organization’s goals and
objectives.
•
Execution of risk management processes (i.e., frame, assess, respond to, and monitor).
•
Effective and efficient allocation of risk management resources.
•
Performance-based outcomes (e.g., risk management metrics) that ensure organizational goals
and objectives are being achieved.
•
Optimizing risk management investments to support organizational objectives.
In tier 1, the risk executive (or function) also plays an important role in sup-
porting risk management by determining how decisions made regarding risk are
carried through the organization governance.34
32There are three basic types of security governance models: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid.
33Applying a consistent and unified governance approach facilitates cost-savings when applying
risk management activities and translating risks between business functions.

Publication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and

management decisions include: (i) the types of that are reserved for specific senior management;
(ii) the types that are deemed to be organization-wide and the types that can be delegated to subor-
dinate organizations or to other roles in the organization; and (iii) how risk management decisions
will be communicated.
196
CHAPTER 6 Risk management

Tier 2 Risk Management Activities
At tier 2, the business/mission processes35 manage risk based on the components
defined in the risk management strategy. Since these processes support the mis-
sion/business functions, they must have an awareness of impact. As an example,
if a sophisticated cyber attack occurred, the mission/business processes need to be
designed to achieve an anticipated level of resiliency. Therefore, a key consider-
ation when defining the mission/business processes is the selection of a risk
response strategy that is within the constraints defined in the risk management
strategy36 [1].
Tier 3 Risk Management Activities
The NIST SDLC integrates risk management activities through the application of
the NIST RMF. The specific risk management activities at tier 3 are guided by
the output of the risk management activities conducted at tier 1 and tier 2, (i.e.,
where the risk management strategy and the risk response strategy are supported
by an information security architecture).37 In addition, the output of the risk man-
agement activities from the other tiers also ensures the information system oper-
ates consistently with the information system resiliency38 requirements.

Publication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and

Overview of Enterprise-Wide Risk Management

TIP
Cloud computing is one example where trust and trustworthiness39 between cloud service providers
(CSPs) and a federal agency is critical for the effective application of the NIST RMF. The Federal
Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) “introduces an innovative policy
approach to developing trusted relationships between Executive departments and agencies and cloud
service providers (CSPs)” [11]. However, for a trusted relationship to exist, transparency into the
risk management and information security activities must include operational visibility based on the
adequate level of confidence needed by the federal agency using the cloud services. “Establishing a
level of confidence about a cloud service environment depends on the ability of the cloud provider
to provision the security controls necessary to protect the organization’s data and applications, and
also the evidence provided about the effectiveness of those controls” [12]. This might require
documenting the risk information needed to address the trust requirements in contracts, service level
agreements (SLAs), or other forms of legal agreements.
NIST RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
The risk management process can be applied as a tiered model as represented in
Fig. 6.3, in which each of the four risk management components, previously

where the risk framing step begins in the risk management cycle and concludes
with monitoring risk before moving to the next tier (i.e., tier 2 and tier 3).
FRAMING RISK
In the risk management process, risk framing establishes the risk management
strategy that provides a common organization-wide strategy for executing the
other steps (assessment, response, and monitoring) of the process that are sup-
ported by the commitment of the organizations, senior management. As illustrated
in Fig. 6.4, input to risk framing can include laws, policies, directives, regula-
tions, contractual relationships, financial limitations, or information that explicitly
(Memorandums of Understanding/Agreement (MOUs/MOAs), governance pro-
cesses) supports key activities in the risk framing step.
Risk framing activities produce guidance that enables the development of a
common perspective on how the organization manages risk. This perspective is
established through the assumptions and constraints, level of risk tolerance, and
FIGURE 6.4

priorities and trade-offs that drive the organizations’ decision-making process, and
the type/size of the organization. Since risk framing may initially be high level or
undefined, a feedback loop should exist to ensure that information from the other
steps of the risk management process are used to adjust the original risk factors that
contribute to the organization’s risk management policies, procedures, standards,
and guidance.
The risk framing step also produces the risk framework and risk methodologies40
that will be used by the organization in tier 2 and tier 3 of the risk management hier-
archy and in the execution of the other risk management steps. For example, if the
organizational governance structure is centralized,41 only one framework and meth-
odology may be required, whereas if the organization is decentralized,42 multiple
frameworks and methodologies may be required. By having a common framework
and methodology for organization-wide tailoring, it ensures that at least there is a
consistent evaluation standard used by the entire organization for assessing risk and
prioritizing risks as they are aggregated (or consolidated) from across the organiza-
tion. This standard can then be applied in the risk assessment step when assessing
risks and in the risk response step when courses of action are prioritized and imple-
mented to achieve the most cost-effective strategy for risk mitigation.43
ASSESSING RISK
The risk assessment step of the risk management process, as shown in Fig. 6.5,
involves two major activities: identifying threats and vulnerabilities and risk deter-
mination. This step receives input from the other risk management processes to help
the decision-makers at each level of the risk management hierarchy identify, priori-
tize, and estimate risks. The inputs to the risk assessment step include, for example,
the risk assessment methodology (risk framing), different courses of actions (risk
response), and new threats and vulnerabilities identified (risk monitoring).

CHAPTER 6 Risk management

Risk assessments can be a useful source of input for risk-related information when
conducted at each of the organizational tiers. Tier 1 and tier 2 apply risk assessments
based on information securityrelated risks associated with organizational gover-
nance and management activities, mission/business processes (or enterprise architec-
ture), and funding of information security programs [11]. Tier 3 risk assessment
activities focus primarily on support information systemrelated activities conducted
during the implementation of the NIST RMF as discussed in Chapter 5, Applying the
NIST Risk Management Framework (i.e., security categorization, security control
selection, security control implementation, security control assessments, security
authorization, and security control monitoring). Previously, risk assessments were
only conducted at tier 3 (information system level). Although, some risk information
cannot be assessed effectively at tier 3, such as tier 1 risks associated with the
organization-wide security program or tier 2 risks associated with common controls
shared across the organization or between entities that have a trusted relationship.
WARNING
According to NIST:
“. . . risk assessments are often not precise instruments of measurement and reflect:
i. the limitations of specific assessment methodologies, tools, and techniques employed;
ii. the subjectivity, quality, and trustworthiness of the data used;
iii. the interpretation of assessment results; and
iv. the skills and expertise of those individuals or groups conducting the assessments.
Since cost, timeliness, and ease of use are a few of the many important factors in the
application of risk assessments, organizations should attempt to reduce the complexity of risk
assessments and maximize the reuse of assessment results by sharing risk-related information
across their enterprises, whenever possible.”
FIGURE 6.5
Risk assessment—inputs, activities, and outputs.
201
NIST Risk Management Process

As previously noted, inputs to the risk assessment can come from a variety of
sources. As illustrated in Fig. 6.6, one of the most important sources is the organi-
zational risk frame that establishes the context for the risk management strategy.
The risk management strategy includes “information regarding policies and require-
ments for conducting risk assessments, specific assessment methodologies to be
employed, procedures for selecting risk factors to be considered, scope of the
assessments, rigor of analyses, degree of formality, and requirements that facilitate
consistent and repeatable risk determinations across the organization” [13]. The risk
assessment methodology, a component of the risk management strategy, includes
the definition of the risk assessment process, risk model (risk factors and relation-
ships among risk factors), assessment approach (quantitatively,44 qualitatively,45 or
semi-quantitatively46), and an analysis approach (threat-oriented, asset/impact-
oriented, or vulnerability-oriented).
RESPONDING TO RISK
The risk response step in Fig. 6.7 includes multiple activities for responding to
risk such as identifying courses of actions, evaluating alternative courses of
action, and selecting and implementing courses of action. As with risk

assessment, the risk response is performed at each level of the risk management
hierarchy, with activities performed at specific tiers. For example, risk response
identification could require considering organization-wide impacts and therefore
might be performed at tier 1, whereas evaluation of alternative courses of action
could require an evaluation of impacts to mission/business processes and therefore
might be performed at tier 2. Regardless at which tier the activity is performed,
the risk decisions receive input from the other risk management processes that are
shared and communicated.
MONITORING RISK
The last step in the risk management process involves monitoring risk. Fig. 6.8
illustrates the two activities performed during the risk monitoring step: risk moni-
toring strategy and risk monitoring. Risk monitoring strategy includes defining
the purpose of the risk monitoring program, type of monitoring to be performed
(e.g., automated vs. manual) and frequency of monitoring activities. Risk monitor-
ing provides organizations with the means to verify compliance,47 determine the

published by NIST and the International Organization for Standards /International
Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC). As a reference, Table 6.2 provides a list
of risk managementrelated standards and guidelines published by NIST and the
ISO/IEC, and can be useful as a basis for understanding how each approaches
risk management.
Risk management practices are the foundation by which the risk management
strategy is communicated through the governance structure. By understanding the
general similarities and differences between each approach, it will enable federal
agencies following the NIST methodology and private sector organizations fol-
lowing the ISO/IEC methodology to more consistently apply risk management
practices across the organizational boundaries. As an example, Fig. 6.9 provides a
“high-level” comparison of the key processes included in the NIST and ISO/IEC
risk management methodologies.
TIP
NIST plays a critical role in aligning standards where possible with those developed
internationally or nationally. Risk management is no exception. The goal of harmonization efforts
performed by NIST is to limit “the burden on organizations that must conform to both ISO/IEC
standards and NIST standards and guidance” [1].

Comparing the NIST and ISO/IEC Risk Management Processes

In Step 1, outlined in Table 6.3, both NIST and the ISO/IEC address framing
the risk (or establishing the risk context).50 In the NIST process, risk framing
requires the organization to develop a risk management strategy that meets its
unique governance structure, mission, and business operations. Although the
NIST process presents a more flexible approach, it is limited in providing specific
guidance for performing the risk framing activity, whereas the ISO/IEC process
provides a more specific set of criteria to use when documenting the risk context.
In the next step, the NIST and the ISO/IEC processes include similar activities
for supporting risk identification and risk determination activities. As shown in
FIGURE 6.9
Comparison of major NIST and ISO/IEC risk management processes.
50From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
Information System View. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2011. Risk
framing (or establishing context) includes defining the criteria used by organizations to determine
“when risk assessment results do not warrant risk responses, then assessment results could be fed
directly to the risk monitoring step as a source of input.”
206
CHAPTER 6 Risk management

Table 6.4, both focus on the determination of risk through the identification of
threats and vulnerabilities and the analysis of the risk-related information to sup-
port a risk determination. One specific difference is an additional activity in the
ISO/IEC risk assessment process for evaluating risks to determine if any actions
should be taken based on the output of risk analysis and risk prioritization.
Additionally, both processes apply the context established in Step 1 as an input
into the assessment of risk within the risk management process.
In Table 6.5, the risk response (or risk treatment) options are selected for
determining which courses of action (e.g., acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, etc.)
to apply as a response to a particular risk. During the risk decision process in
Step 3, both the NIST and the ISO/IEC recognize that regardless of the decision,
there still remains a degree of residual risk that must be addressed and compared
against the organization’s risk tolerance [1]. However, as shown in Table 6.6, the
ISO/IEC process (Step 4), includes an additional activity for the explicit and for-
mal acceptance of residual risk. The NIST process also includes risk acceptance,

but as a separate course of action (i.e., acceptance of risk in the NIST RMF Step
5 and Step 6) when responding to risk that has been determined to be within the
organizational risk tolerance.
Both NIST and the ISO/IEC processes address the ongoing communications
and sharing of risk-related information with decision-makers and stakeholders
impacted by the risk response decisions. This activity uses the bi-directional path-
way to communicate risk information to ensure those with responsibility for
implementing the risk decisions understand the actions that must be taken. Unlike
the ISO/IEC process shown in Table 6.7, the NIST process does not specifically
identify the communication, sharing, and exchanging of risk information as a sep-
arate step, rather it is linked to other risk management activities such as risk mon-
itoring where risk-based decisions are made as an integral part of every tier
within the organization’s risk management hierarchy, that is governance level,
mission/business process level, and information system level.
In the final step outlined in Table 6.8, monitoring (Step 6), both the NIST and
the ISO/IEC processes focus on monitoring risks (and risk factors) for any changes.
The NIST process includes an additional requirement for the development of a for-
mal risk monitoring strategy that serves as a separate function within the monitoring
strategy for facilitating monitoring activities through a risk monitoring program. The
risk monitoring program includes features such as monitoring for compliance, effec-
tiveness, changes, and type (automated vs. manual) and frequency of monitoring. In
the ISO/IEC risk management process, an emphasis is placed on not only monitoring
risks and their factors, but also monitoring the risk management process itself to
ensure that it is consistently applied and improvements in the process or relevance
of risk criteria are integrated into the risk management approach.

CHAPTER 6 Risk management

SUMMARY
This chapter introduced the topic of organization-wide risk management. Risk
management plays a critical role within the federal government, and the cultural
adoption of information technology. The adoption of cloud services will need to
be addressed by a government-wide approach in which risk management is inte-
grated into the federal information security programs to achieve a “do once, use
many times” approach.
In this chapter we also introduced to the federal risk management practices,
and how over time, the maturity of these practices evolved. Since both federal
agencies and service providers may adopt different risk management processes,
understanding where the differences might exist is important to cost-effectively
implement risk management programs. Therefore, we concluded with a brief
comparison of the harmonization between the federal risk management practices
and the international risk management standards.

INTRODUCTION
Managing information security and compliance requirements on an audit-by-audit
basis can be a challenging and difficult task, specifically where security control
assessment results and evidence are gathered, analyzed, and reported simulta-
neously. This duplication of effort can result in significant inefficiencies and an
unproductive use of resources. However, the ability to leverage reuse and satisfy
multiple compliance and contractual obligations requires a comprehensive infor-
mation security and compliance framework. Additionally, the framework needs to
be able to harmonize compliance requirements across both the federal government
and industry.
Federal agencies, contractors, and service providers are required to adhere
to a variety of mandates that cut across multiple federal laws, directives, regu-
lations, standards, and policies. In addition to the federal requirements, some
service providers are required to support other compliance obligations from a
number of different industry security laws, regulations, and standards. The
overlap in the security requirements and compliance obligations has resulted in
service providers establishing multiple, and sometimes concurrent, information
security and risk management programs. Some of these programs even operate
independently due to the inferred incapability, resulting in unnecessary
redundancies.
The federal government has, itself, struggled with similar problems. Federal
information security programs are often complex and continuously changing. In
addition, the increasing reliance on external service providers for information
technology (IT) services, and the duplication of certification and accreditation
(C&A) processes have required the federal government to transform existing pro-
cesses to one that is more unified, agile, and streamlined. One of the goals of the

new process is to unify the different information security frameworks across the
federal government and establish a foundational set of common information secu-
rity standards and guidelines. This new process also requires the involvement of a
government-wide effort to continue to identify gaps and standardize federal secu-
rity requirements, in addition to harmonizing with existing international security
standards, thereby creating consistency in security standards and practices to sup-
port reciprocity by enabling the federal government to leverage existing authori-
zations, a necessary requirement for the Federal Risk and Authorization
Management Program (FedRAMP).1
OVERVIEW OF CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION
The concept of C&A2 is a well-defined security methodology used both within
the US government and internationally.3 For illustrative purposes, Table 7.1 pro-
vides definitions for both certification and accreditation included in various secu-
rity standards (and guidelines) used over the years from across the different
federal communities (i.e., Civilian Agencies, the Department of Defense (DoD),
and the Intelligence Community (IC)).4 In reviewing the definitions, one can
identify a common definitional purpose for the C&A process, even though the
policies, procedures, and practices may be uniquely developed to describe how
the different C&A processes are implemented for use within each of the federal
communities. Therefore, a common definition of the C&A process can be summa-
rized as follows:
A process for evaluating (or assessing) the technical and nontechnical security
safeguards (or controls) implemented to protect the information technology
systems or applications against threats and vulnerabilities to achieve an
acceptable level of risk.
In the next section, we will examine each of the federal C&A processes to
gain a better understanding of how the federal government’s security practices
have evolved over time. In addition, the examination will serve to provide an
insight into the significant challenges that exists for establishing and maintaining

agile development methodologies to maintain pace with quickly evolving technol-
ogy architectures. Using agile methodologies also enables the federal government
to be more adaptable and better equipped to support changes in their mission and
business requirements. Similar to the technology changes discussed in Chapter 1,
Introduction to the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, as early as the 1970s,
C&A processes used by the federal government have also evolved. The evolution
of C&A processes and practices has been established through the development of
a number of different standards (and guidelines). However, these processes and
practices have also been applied differently, both between federal communities
and federal agencies within the same community.6
In the remainder of this section, we will focus our discussion through a brief
overview of the different C&A processes that have been used across the federal
government with the intent of gaining an understanding into how they evolved
and were changed. However, this section is not meant to be a comprehensive tuto-
rial of the federal C&A processes, but instead it will serve to provide a summary
of how information security and risk management practices have evolved and
were implemented independently across the different federal communities.
Civilian agencies
In 1983, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now known as National
Institute
of
Standards
and
Technology
(NIST),
published
the
Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) PUB 102, “Guideline for Computer
Certification and Accreditation.” This publication provided federal agencies
with a guide for establishing and carrying out a program and a technical process
for computer security C&A7 [1]. The key purpose of the publication was to
achieve two main objectives:
•
Establishing a program for certification and accreditation (e.g., policies and
procedures, and roles and responsibilities); and
•
Performing a certification and accreditation (e.g., planning, data collection,
evaluation, and reporting findings).
6From Wilshusen, G. Progress Made on Harmonizing Policies and Guidance or National Security
and Non-National Security Systems. Washington, DC: US Government Accountability Office;
2010. “Prior to efforts to harmonize information security guidance, federal organizations had
developed separate, and sometimes disparate, guidance for information security. For example, the
National Security Agency used the National Information Systems Certification and Accreditation
Process, the intelligence community used DCID 6/3, and DOD used the Department of Defense
Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process, which later became the
DIACAP.”

Overview of Certification and Accreditation

The FIPS PUB 102 C&A process became the standard of practice for use by
civilian federal agencies until 2004, when NIST published the first version of the
Special Publication (SP) 800-37, “Guide for the Security Certification and
Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.”
During the period between the publication of FIPS PUB 102 and NIST SP
800-37, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)8 became law
(2002). As a result of the gap in guidance, Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) released a memo through the Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO)
Council to provide interim guidance for federal agencies until NIST published SP
800-37. This memo gave federal agencies the freedom to use another comparable
security certification methodology provided it addressed the requirements covered
in NIST SP 800-26 [10].9
When the first version of NIST SP 800-37 was published, it became the stan-
dard guidance used by civilian federal agencies for non-National Security
Systems (NSSs) until the C&A process was revised in February 2010 through an
updated version of NIST SP 800-37 (Revision 1). Although this new publication,
led by NIST, was created through the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative
(JTFTI) Interagency Working Group. As will be revisited in a later section, the
goal of the JTFTI was the development of a common set of core standards and
guidelines that would be part of a government-wide C&A transformation effort.
This new effort aimed at modernizing the traditional C&A process through the
elimination of separate processes and the implementation of a risk-based security
authorization approach. This new approach focused on creating a common infor-
mation security framework that could be used across the federal government.10 In
addition, the focus was to make the process more dynamic by enabling near, real-
time risk management and continuous monitoring through a single Risk
Management Framework (RMF).11

CHAPTER 7 Comparison of Federal and International Security

Department of Defense (DoD)
In 1994, the National Computer Security Center (NCSC),12 originally known as
the DoD Computer Security Center (CSC), a part of the National Security
Agency (NSA), published the “Introduction to Certification and Accreditation”
(or the “Blue Book”). This book was one of many standards and guidelines
included within the “Rainbow Series”13 and provided a high-level introduction for
both the DoD and non-DoD communities on the basic concepts and policies asso-
ciated with C&A, including roles and responsibilities and the risk management
process. Following the publication of the “Blue Book,” the “Certification and
Accreditation Process Handbook for Certifiers” was published to provide more
focused guidance on creating a “structured process by which to perform a C&A
of a system” [10].
However, it was not until 1997 through the Defense-wide Information
Security Program (DISSP)14 that a DoD-wide C&A process was created. This
new process, which became known as the Department of Defense Information
Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP), was
expected to be the standard C&A process for use across the DoD. DITSCAP not
only established a standard process to certify and accredit information systems,
but was also to be used to maintain the security posture of the Defense
Information Infrastructure (DII) through an infrastructure approach to C&A [11].
After FISMA became law, the DoD C&A process changed again. In 2006,
through an interim instruction, DITSCAP began the transition to a new dynamic pro-
cess known as the Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation
Process (DIACAP). DIACAP, through a final official issuance in 2007, was
designed as the DoD-wide C&A process to be used to support the transition of DoD
information systems to Global Information Grid (GIG)15 standards and a net-centric
environment. In addition, this new process had the objective of enabling improved
information sharing across the DoD through a standard C&A approach that focused
on providing specific DoD-wide guidance on managing and disseminating enterprise
standards and guidelines for Information Assurance (IA) design, implementation,
configuration, validation, operation sustainment, and reporting [12].

Overview of Certification and Accreditation

Intelligence Community (IC)
The Director of Central Intelligence Directives (DCID), issued by the Director of
Central
Intelligence
(DCI),
were
formerly
used
to
provide
intelligence
community-wide policies and guidance, including governing information systems
that stored, processed, or transmitted intelligence information. In 1983, DCID
1/16 was published (and later updated in 1988) by the DCI to establish a security
policy for the processing, storage, and transmission of US foreign intelligence and
counterintelligence in automated information systems (AIS) and networks.
Additionally, the criteria in the DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation
Criteria (TCSEC), published by the NCSC in 1985, was identified by DCID 1/16
as the protective measures (administrative, environmental, and technical security
requirements) that were required to be met by the AIS to protect sensitive infor-
mation. However, DCID 1/16 later became superseded by DCID 6/316 in 1999,
with an implementation manual being published in 200017 (and an update in
2002). DCID 6/3 became the first C&A process documented for use by the IC.
DCI policy was used within the IC until the establishment of the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in 2005. In 2008, the ODNI published
the Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 503, which was to supersede DCID
6/3.18 The ICD 503 was established to implement the strategic goals19 agreed
upon by the IC CIO, the DoD CIO, OMB, and NIST. ICD 503 and other transi-
tion guidance in the form of directives and standards directed the use of
Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) policy and guidance, which in
turn pointed to the harmonized NIST guidance [13].

Security Directive (NSD) 42, ‘National Policy for the Security of National Security Telecommunications
and Information Systems.’ This was reaffirmed by Executive Order (E.O.) 13284, ‘Amendment of

to the DITSCAP, was used by Civilian Agencies for NSS21 for both national tele-
communication and information systems. In 2005, the CNSS issued the “National
Policy on Certification and Accreditation of National Security Systems” to give
civilian federal agencies the flexibility to use NIACAP or an alternative C&A
process. Since the CNSS is also a part of the JTFTI Interagency Working Group,
it is “working with representatives from the Civil, Defense, and Intelligence
Community to produce a unified information security framework” [14]. As a first
step, CNSS Policy No. 2222 was issued, establishing a requirement for the use of
an organization-wide IA risk management program for all NSSs, which is consis-
tent with the NIST standards and guidelines.
NOTE
Outside of the application of C&A processes on traditional information systems, there also exist
C&A processes for interfaces used to control access or transfer information between differing
security domains. The Secret and Below Interoperability (SABI) and the Top Secret/Sensitive
Compartmented Information (SCI) and Below Interoperability (TSABI) processes have been
developed by the DoD and IC for addressing risk associated with operating cross-domain
solutions (CDS)23 that control the connection between networks of different classification levels.
•
SABI C&A process follows the DIACAP C&A principles.
•
TSABI C&A process follows the DCID 6/3 C&A principles.
In an effort to unify the two processes, the Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO),
was created “to more effectively share information between security domains—that is, to move
information between networks at different clearance (classification) levels throughout the federal
government” [15]. The UCDMO, in an effort to unify the security requirements, published the CDS
Overlay in December 2011,24 which provides a single comprehensive set of security control guidance
for CDS. The CDS Overlay is based on the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 3 and the CNSS-1253.
In addition, the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 described CDSs as potential situations where
additional conditions and controls might be required:
Security control baselines do not assume that information systems have to operate across
multiple security policy domains. The baselines assume a flat view of information flows
(Continued)
21NSSs were briefly discussed in Chapter 5. However, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-59,

guidance for the identification of NSSs.

(i.e., the same security policies in different domains when information moves across
authorization boundaries). To address cross-domain services and transactions, some subset of
the AC-4 security control enhancements can be considered to ensure adequate protection of
information when transferred between information systems with different security policies [16].
TOWARDS A UNIFIED APPROACH TO C&A
As previously mentioned, the JTFTI, led by NIST, with participating members
from the Civilian, Defense, and Intelligence Communities, is a joint partnership
focused on transforming the federal government’s C&A processes. One of the
primary goals is to establish a “unified information security framework that
harmonizes security standards and guidelines for NSSs and non-NSSs” [13]. This
harmonization effort not only eliminates the duplication among the various fed-
eral C&A processes, but also aims at reducing the cost associated with managing
and operating multiple overlapping C&A processes.
In addition, the unified process enables the government to more effectively share
information when responding to the growing number of advanced cyber threats.
NOTE
The DoD Cloud Computing Strategy, published by the DoD CIO,25 directed leveraging efforts
such as FedRAMP, which prescribes the use of the NIST standards and guidelines as a
standardized and streamlined C&A process for commercial and federal cloud providers [17].
These cyber threats have led to challenges within the federal government’s
ability to seamlessly share information and authorizations through reciprocity,
effectively limiting the reuse of evidence when verifying the implementation of
security controls between interconnected systems. As depicted in Fig. 7.1, the
unification of C&A processes establishes a bridge across the various federal
communities by harmonizing policies and guidance. This harmonization process
focuses on using the NIST standards and guidelines currently applied to
non-NSSs, leaving the DoD and IC to shift their focus to addressing the unique
security requirements through community-specific26 policies and guidance.
25The DoD CIO is also a permanent member of the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB),
along with the CIO of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the US General
Services
Administration (GSA). Available from: https://www.fedramp.gov/files/2015/01/JAB-

issued under FISMA.”

NOTE
There are several key differences between the information and system categorization steps and the
control selection processes described between the CNSS policies and the NIST standards and
guidelines. These differences [13] include:
•
System Categorization—different methodologies27 are used to categorize the impact associated
with information that is stored, processed, or transmitted.
•
Security Control Selection—selection of control baselines or control profiles will be conducted
differently within each of these communities.
•
Program Management Controls—program management controls required for nonnational
information security programs will be optional for national security system information
security programs.
NIST AND ISO/IEC INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS
In the last section, we discussed an effort to transition toward a common
government-wide foundation for information security using the NIST standards
(and guidelines). In this section, the discussion will focus on the harmonization
between the NIST standards (and guidelines) and the International Organization for
Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) infor-
mation security standards,28 which are widely adopted for use within the private
sector29 for addressing information security and risk management. The NIST secu-
rity standards (and guidelines)30 provide a framework for a mandatory certification
process directed by FISMA31 to authorize information systems for use by both fed-
eral agencies and contractors. Whereas, the ISO/IEC standards provide a voluntary

National Security Community, the potential impact levels determined for confidentiality, integrity,
and availability are retained, meaning there are 27 possible three-value combinations for NSI or
NSS, as opposed to the three possible single-value categorizations obtained using the guidelines in
FIPS 200. Retaining the discrete impact levels for each of the three security objectives is done to
provide a better granularity in allocating security controls to baselines, and should thereby reduce
the need for subsequent tailoring of controls.

NOTE
The NIST FISMA Implementation Project includes several initiatives under the second phase
(Phase II: Implementation and Assessment Aids) of the project. The ISO Harmonization Initiative
focuses on identifying common relationships and mappings of FISMA standards, guidelines, and
requirements with: (i) ISO/IEC 27000 series information security management standards; and
(ii) ISO/IEC 9000 and 17000 series quality management, and laboratory testing, inspection, and
accreditation standards. This harmonization is important for minimizing duplication of effort for
organizations that must demonstrate compliance to both FISMA and ISO requirements [18].
BOUNDARY AND SCOPE DEFINITION
The NIST RMF and the ISO/IEC “Plan-Do-Check-Act” (PDCA) focuses on
applying a structured, risk-based approach for the integration of information
security. Both NIST (800-37 Revision 1—RMF Step 1) and the ISO/IEC
(27001—Clause 4.2.1.a) require the identification of a boundary34 around the
information system.35 However, within the ISO/IEC process, the scope (or
boundary) typically includes the organization and the information system
that maintains and has control over the information system. To effectively
characterize the boundary and scope of protection,36 processes require the

organization to define the associated policies,37 assets, technologies, loca-
tions, and personnel.
SECURITY POLICY
After the boundary and scope have been defined, the organization creates an
information security policy (addressed through the NIST SP 800-53 XX-1 con-
trols and the information security management system (ISMS) policy38 in ISO/
IEC 27001), which establishes the management’s direction and principles for gov-
erning the information system. In addition, the security policy39 should, at a mini-
mum, include a purpose and scope (SP 800-53 XX-1 controls), identify the roles
and responsibilities (SP 800-53 XX-1 controls and 27001—A.6.1.3), address a
statement of compliance that is supported through a management commitment
(SP 800-53 XX-1 controls and 27001—A.6.1.1), and coordinate among organiza-
tional entities (SP 800-53 XX-1 controls and 27001—A.6.1.2).
NOTE
In NIST SP 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and
Organizations,” the first control in each control family40 (e.g., Access Controls, Identification and
Authentication, Incident Response, etc.) requires identifying the policies and procedures that are
implemented by the remaining security controls (and control enhancements) included in the
family of controls.
The policies may be inherited completely (common control41) from the organizational policies
or may be derived partially (hybrid control42) from an organizational policy that is further defined
in an information system-specific policy.

CHAPTER 7 Comparison of Federal and International Security

RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY (CONTEXT)
Both NIST and ISO/IEC require an organizational policy (or ISMS policy) that
aligns with the risk management strategy43 (or context). The risk management
strategy is developed as an output of the risk framing (or context definition). The
framing44 (context) definition is established as a part of the risk management pro-
cess45 discussed in Chapter 6, Risk management.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Before the allocation46 of the security controls, the organization needs to under-
stand the risks by conducting a risk assessment. Both NIST (800-37 Revision 1—
RMF Step 2) and the ISO/IEC (27001—Clause 4.2.1.dg) address the selection
of security controls before and after the risk assessment. In addition, NIST and
the ISO/IEC have a separate function within the risk management process (dis-
cussed in see chapter: Risk management) where the risks are evaluated based on
criteria established during the framing (or context definition) step. This criterion
assists in determining which of the risk response (or risk treatment) options in
Table 7.3 would be appropriate as a treatment for the risk.
One notable difference between the NIST and ISO/IEC processes is the
explicit requirements for the acceptance of risk defined in the risk treatment plan
and the residual risk acceptance. For example, NIST does specify the acceptance
of risk; it is performed as a result of the approval of the system security plan
(800-37 Revision 1—RMF Step 3) and authorization to operate (800-37 Revision
1—RMF Step 5). However, both the NIST and ISO/IEC risk management
processes include the ongoing monitoring where risk management becomes a con-
tinual process.47

of the three tiers (governance, mission/business process, or information system levels) in the risk
management hierarchy.

SECURITY OBJECTIVES AND CONTROLS
The selection (and implementation) of control objectives and controls is a similar
activity under both the NIST and ISO/IEC processes. The selection process focuses
on identifying those control objectives and controls that meet the requirements of
the organizational assessment of risk identified during the execution of the risk
assessment, in addition to requirements derived from other sources such as business
requirements, regulatory requirements, legal requirements, and contractual obliga-
tions. One significant difference that exists is in the scope and organization of the
security controls included in NIST security control families (800-53—Appendix F)
and the ISO/IEC security control clauses (27001—Annex A). In Table 7.4, a map-
ping is provided that illustrates, the security control clauses in ISO/IEC 27001 and
the equivalent security controls in NIST SP 800-53. Although the security control
mappings provide a high-level comparison of the gaps between the organization of
control objectives and controls included in ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53,
“there is still some degree of subjectivity in the mapping analysis because the
mappings are not always one-to-one and may not be completely equivalent” [19].
NOTE
The NIST SP 800-53 AC control family is defined as follows:
Organizations must limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting
on behalf of authorized users or devices (including other information systems) and to the
types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to exercise [19].
The AC-1 security control requirement states:
AC-1 ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Control: The organization:
a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
roles]:
1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated
access controls; and
b. Reviews and updates the current:
1. Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
2. Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

NOTE (CONTINUED)
Supplemental guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for
the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC
family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the
organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary.
The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or
conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain
organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for
particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key
factor in establishing policy and procedures.

Examining the mapping in Table 7.4, the AC family of controls are distributed
among the various security control clauses (27001—Annex A). For example, AC-
1 is covered in multiple ISO/IEC control objectives and controls. Table 7.5 pro-
vides a mapping of AC-1 to the ISO/IEC standards covered in the multiple con-
trol objectives and controls.
Once the control objectives and controls have been selected, they need to be
documented through a System Security Plan (800-37 Revision 1—RMF Step 2)
and the Statement of Applicability (27001—Clause 4.2.1.j). Although the specifi-
cation of the formats may differ, the specific scope as outlined in Table 7.6 pro-
vides a general comparison of the requirements.

NIST and ISO/IEC Information Security Standards

SUMMARY
This chapter introduced the federal C&A processes. These processes, which have
evolved over time, have been used by federal agencies to certify and accredit their
information systems. More recently, these processes have followed a multiyear
process of convergences into a single unified process, led by NIST and supple-
mented by community-driven requirements to accommodate specific security
requirements and information sensitivity.
In addition to the federal certification standards, the ISO/IEC has developed a
comparable set of standards that have been used by the private sector and interna-
tionally, and includes a similar process for certifying the organizations’ informa-
tion systems. The ISO/IEC process requires the implementation, operation,
monitoring, review, and maintenance of an ISMS that is adequately protected
based on information security requirements determined by a risk assessment and
other applicable requirements (e.g., business, regulatory, contractual, and legal).
As the security and compliance requirements consistently grow and change,
organizations will have to adjust their approaches, tools, and techniques to ensure
that not only their security programs can respond to the changes in the threat
environment, but can also leverage the efficiency and effectiveness of unified
information security frameworks to assist them in addressing multiple security
laws, regulation, and standards.

INTRODUCTION TO FEDRAMP
In mid-2009, an interagency effort,1 created under the Federal Cloud Computing
Initiative, was established to focus on solving a single problem statement—How
do we best perform security authorization and continuous monitoring for out-
sourced and multiagency systems? [1]. This problem included addressing barriers
to the adoption of cloud computing solutions and the cost-effective consolidation
of data centers and applications. Traditionally, federal agencies have indepen-
dently conducted risk management activities through the certification and accredi-
tation (C&A) of their information systems (either residing within the federal
agency accreditation boundary or operated by a contractor on their behalf).
Applying this same model to shared services could greatly reduce the overall cost
benefit.
There are other issues and challenges associated with applying a singular
authorization model such as the incompatibility between different federal agency
security policies, differences in acquisition and compliance processes, and an

inconsistent and variable application of federal information security and privacy
requirements. These issues and challenges are not necessarily new to the federal
government, and they existed in the lifecycle of traditional federal information
technology (IT) environments. However, the issues and challenges become more
amplified when applied at a larger scale to shared and outsourced information
systems, such as a shared services approach that focuses on improving
government-wide operational efficiency and effectiveness. Without adopting a
more centralized methodology the benefits become less achievable and could
potentially inhibit adoption of cloud computing solutions.
The solution—an initiative that would provide joint authorization and continu-
ous security monitoring services using a unified, government-wide risk manage-
ment approach that federal agencies across the government could leverage [1].
This initiative, known as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management
Program (FedRAMP),2 was designed to focus on three main areas: authorization,
continuous monitoring, and federal security requirements. The initial goal of
FedRAMP was to establish a unified risk management process that:
•
Increased security of cloud solutions through a common assessment approach;
•
Eliminated duplication of effort and achieved cost-savings through efficiency;
•
Enabled rapid acquisition through leveraged authorizations;
•
Improved reuse of authorization packages based on a common set of security
requirements;
•
Facilitated use of shared services across multiple federal agencies; and
•
Integrated a government-wide security approach.
In addition to the benefits of unifying under a common implementation of the
NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), commercial service providers also
benefited because they only had to perform a single assessment to obtain a
Provisional Authorization To Operate (P-ATO).3 Since the FedRAMP program
also included a single government-wide governance body, federal agencies could
leverage the P-ATOs, greatly reducing their effort because they do not have to
individually initiate independent risk management activities.4
In November 2010, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO)
released the Proposed Security Assessment & Authorization for US Government
Cloud Computing. This initial framework was based on 18 months of collabora-
tion with stakeholders across the public and private sector. However, the proposed
solution was also developed for the purpose of encouraging a discussion around
the “best” approach by gathering “input, knowledge, and experience” [2] neces-
sary for framing the security control requirements and processes for cloud

computing environments. The FedRAMP program continued to evolve for the
next 13 months until December 8, 20115 when the Federal Chief Information
Officer (CIO)6 published a memorandum titled Security Authorization of
Information Systems in Cloud Computing Environments, which established the
federal policy for the protection of federal information in cloud services.
The memorandum also described the components of the FedRAMP effort, and
established milestones for the program and the policy governing the adoption by
federal agencies [3].
FEDRAMP OVERVIEW
As previously discussed, the FedRAMP program was established through an
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum in December 2011. The
FedRAMP program is the first government-wide security authorization program,
developed to standardize how Federal Information Security Modernization Act
(FISMA)7 would be applied8 to cloud computing services—government or com-
mercial. FedRAMP requirements are mandatory for federal agencies and Cloud
Service Provider (CSP), and provide a common framework to security assess-
ment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud services, but uses the
same framework federal agencies currently use to perform security authorizations
of their IT systems and services. Additionally, federal agencies are still required
to issue an authorization to operate for use of the cloud service.
The purpose of FedRAMP is to:
•
Ensure that cloud systems used by Government entities have adequate
safeguards;
•
Eliminate duplication of effort and reduce risk management costs; and
•
Enable rapid and cost-effective Government procurement of information
systems/services [6].
The results of the FedRAMP program are cloud service authorizations that
can be leveraged across multiple federal agencies.

FedRAMP Overview

FEDRAMP POLICY MEMO
The FedRAMP “Policy Memo”9 established the governing federal policy for the
secure adoption and government-wide use of cloud services. The memorandum
describes the framework for implementing the FedRAMP components that includes:
•
A standard set of security requirements for provisional10 authorization and
ongoing monitoring;
•
A conformity assessment program for third-party assessment11;
•
An assembly of security experts from across government to review
authorization documents12 to support the risk-based decisions by the Joint
Authorization Board (JAB)13;
•
Standardized contract language that integrates FedRAMP requirements into
the federal government acquisition process; and
•
An authoritative central repository for storing authorization documents.
As illustrated in Fig. 8.1, the FedRAMP “Policy Memo” is represented at the
top of the FedRAMP document hierarchy, providing the highest level of gover-
nance. The governance processes defined in the FedRAMP Security Assessment
Framework (SAF), previously the FedRAMP Concept of Operations (CONOPS),
are supported by the foundational elements, which include: (i) security assessment
templates and guidelines; (ii) the Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)
program description and application; and (iii) the three parallel ongoing monitor-
ing mechanisms (automated/manual data feeds, annual attestation, and event/inci-
dent handling). The foundational elements provide the FedRAMP PMO with the
key functions needed to meet the operating capability for the program.
9FedRAMP is a supplementary policy to OMB A-130 for security authorizations.

The scope of coverage for the FedRAMP “Policy Memo” is inclusive of
almost all cloud services, regardless of the service and deployment models14
or whether the cloud service is commercial15 or noncommercial.16 In addi-

FEDRAMP GOVERNANCE AND STAKEHOLDERS
OMB, which has government-wide management oversight of federal information/
IT (including privacy and security), is the governing body that issued the
FedRAMP Policy Memo that defines the key requirements and capabilities of
the program. The FedRAMP program is also governed by a JAB that acts as the
primary governance and decision making body for FedRAMP. The FedRAMP
PMO, which is housed within the US General Services Administration (GSA),
collaborates with other stakeholders to identify high priority security and iden-
tity management initiatives and develop recommendations for policies, proce-
dures, and standards to address those initiatives. Together these different
stakeholders within the Executive Branch work to develop, manage, and operate
the program.
•
Other governing bodies of FedRAMP include:
•
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which provides
technical assistance to the 3PAO process, maintains FISMA standards
(refer to Chapter 5, Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework) and
establishes related technical standards.
•
Federal CIO Council disseminates FedRAMP information to Federal
Agency CIOs and other representatives through cross-agency
communication and events.

Additionally, DHS updates requirements for FISMA reporting.
PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS
The four key primary federal government stakeholders for FedRAMP include the
DHS, the JAB, the FedRAMP PMO, and the federal agencies.22 Each of the pri-
mary stakeholders shares some responsibility for implementing the FedRAMP

security policies and practices, including developing and overseeing the
implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on
information security” [5].
•
Section 3543(b) and (c)—Limitations associated with National Security
Systems (NSSs) and Department of Defense (DoD), and Intelligence
Community (IC) information systems.
The responsibilities assigned under this memorandum were inherited by the
FedRAMP “Policy Memo” and gave the DHS the responsibility under FedRAMP
for four key areas:
•
Government-wide and agency-specific cybersecurity assistance;
•
Cybersecurity operations and incident response coordination;
•
Continuous monitoring standards development29;
•
Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) program implementation.30
JAB
The JAB was chartered under a joint agreement31 between the CIOs of GSA,
DHS, and DoD with the objective of:
•
Defining and regularly reviewing the security authorization requirements;
•
Approving accreditation criteria for the 3PAOs;
•
Establishing the criteria for the queue that will prioritize authorization package
review;
•
Reviewing authorization packages;
•
Granting provisional authorizations;
•
Ensuring reviews and updates of provisional authorization;
•
Establishing mechanisms for the maintenance of the security authorization
requirements.
The JAB is comprised of Authorizing Officials (AOs) and AO-designated
technical representatives from GSA, DHS, and DoD, and is supported through the

FedRAMP Governance and Stakeholders

FedRAMP PMO that operates within the GSA, Office of Citizens Services and
Innovative Technologies (OCSIT).
FedRAMP PMO
The FedRAMP PMO is a critical operational function that provides most of the
administrative and technical support for FedRAMP processes and frameworks,32
to include facilitating the implementation of the security assessment and authori-
zation (SA&A) processes in the NIST RMF,33 excluding the actual authorization.
In addition, the FedRAMP PMO operates most of the programmatic functions of
the FedRAMP processes and activities that support the key components included
in Fig. 8.1 of the FedRAMP operating model such as:
•
3PAO conformity assessment program.
•
Authorization package queue.
•
Education and outreach.
•
Authorization repository.
•
Security assessment templates and guidelines, to include Memorandums of
Understanding (MOUs)/Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) and standard
contract language and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
Federal Agencies
The role of the federal agency in FedRAMP is as a federal customer, which uses
the processes (e.g., SAF, NIST RMF, etc.), and documentation (e.g., FedRAMP
templates, NIST standards and guidelines, FedRAMP authorization packages,
etc.) to procure and use cloud services to meet the objectives of the “Cloud First”
policy, originally discussed in the 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform
Federal Information Technology Management34 and further defined in the
Federal Cloud Computing Strategy.35 The federal agency, as a party within a
contract36 for cloud services, is to use FedRAMP as a cost-effective mechanism

for the secure adoption of cloud services that are within the scope of the
FedRAMP “Policy Memo.”
FEDRAMP ACCELERATED PROCESS
The FedRAMP Accelerated process was announced on March 28, 2016, with the
focus of improving the timeline for completing the FedRAMP JAB P-ATO.37 In
the process, a FedRAMP 3PAO conducts a readiness (capabilities) assessment or
“pre-audit” before completing the security assessment and JAB review. As illus-
trated in Fig. 8.3, the FedRAMP PMO will conduct Readiness Assessment
Review of the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR).38
The RAR “identifies the minimum FedRAMP requirements necessary for all
CSPs to meet to attain a FedRAMP ATO. CSPs who have a RAR approved by
the FedRAMP PMO will be deemed “FedRAMP Ready” in the FedRAMP
Marketplace” [16].
The FedRAMP Readiness Assessment and RAR provide information on the
organizational processes and the security capabilities of the CSP system. This
information assists the FedRAMP PMO in determining the readiness of the CSP
system in achieving a P-ATO. The 3PAO submits the RAR to the FedRAMP
PMO with an attestation.39 To achieve a “FedRAMP Ready,” the CSP would go
through an assessment that focuses on key capabilities based on federal man-
dates40 (see Table 8.1) and FedRAMP requirements41 (see Table 8.2 through 8.8)
that must be met by the CSP.
37The FedRAMP Readiness Assessment is only applicable to FedRAMP JAB P-ATO and is only
encouraged for use in the Agency ATO path.

The 3PAO must use its expert judgment to subjectively evaluate the CSP’s overall readiness and
factor this evaluation into its attestation.”

CHAPTER 8 FedRAMP primer

FEDRAMP SECURITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
The initial version of the FedRAMP CONOPS was published on February 7,
2012. The CONOPS leveraged the initial draft of the FedRAMP SA&A pro-
cesses42 and similarly included: security assessment, security authorization, and
continuous monitoring. However, through the maturity of the program, the initial
processes were expanded to address those core process elements that will be gov-
erned by FedRAMP to support several important outputs:
•
Adequacy of information security for cloud services.
•
Implementation of a common risk management approach.
•
Improved procurement of cloud services.
After the FedRAMP program achieved full operating capability in 2014, the
FedRAMP CONOPS was rewritten as the FedRAMP SAF. The FedRAMP SAF
was built upon the NIST RMF43 described in NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide
for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems,
and follows the same SA&A processes used by federal agencies when conducting
Table 8.7 FedRAMP Requirements—Configuration and Risk Management [16]

Does the CSP establish configuration settings for products employed that reflect the most
restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements? [CM-6]
Does the CSP ensure that checklists for configuration settings are Security Content

their own security assessment and authorizations. However, the FedRAMP pro-
gram simplified the NIST RMF by creating four phases that encompass the six
steps as described in the NIST RMF.
NOTE
Federal agencies are required to assess and authorize information system in accordance with
FISMA. The FedRAMP SAF provides a structured approach for use by CSPs and the federal
government. The FedRAMP SAF also offers a catalyst for developing similar processes and
practices that will be used by the private sector when adopting cloud services. By offering a
similar model for conducting due diligence when evaluating the information security, risk
management, and compliance of cloud services, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) developed the
Open Certification Framework (OCF)44, a program for flexible, incremental, and multilayered
cloud provider certification according to the CSA’s industry-leading security guidance and control
objectives. The FedRAMP operates under a “do once, use many times” concept, where the CSA
OCF operates under a “certify-once, use-often” concept. However, both models can also be used
as options by CSPs, saving both time and cost associated with consumer due diligence activities.
In addition, by leveraging cloud services that have been reviewed under the FedRAMP and OCF
model, cloud consumers can reduce the need to perform their own due diligence, potentially
accelerating the development and deployment of new products and services (Tables 8.9 and 8.10).

As previously illustrated in Fig. 8.2, FedRAMP requires the interaction of
multiple participants. The FedRAMP SAF further elaborated on the role of each
participant in Table 8.11.
The FedRAMP SAF provides the high-level overview and operating model
that encompasses four key phases that govern the life cycle of a cloud computing
service within FedRAMP. As shown in Fig. 8.4, the FedRAMP SAF focuses on
phases that include: document, assess, authorize, and monitor.

FedRAMP Security Assessment Framework

FEDRAMP SECURITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK PHASES
FISMA requires federal agencies to ensure the protection of federal information
and information systems. The accountability for this requirement cannot be trans-
ferred to the FedRAMP PMO, but instead, as illustrated in Fig. 8.2, it is shared
between the FedRAMP PMO and the federal agency based on the scope of the eval-
uation (i.e., FedRAMP security requirements baseline vs the agency-specific security
and privacy requirements). The FedRAMP SAF used in conducting the SA&A of
cloud services are designed to be compatible with the existing risk management
practices already defined by NIST and used in traditional IT environments or
FedRAMP-exempt cloud solutions. Therefore, only the differences within the
FedRAMP SAF and the NIST RMF45 will be discussed in this section.

CHAPTER 8 FedRAMP primer

Document Phase
The FedRAMP JAB, in collaboration with the Federal CIO Council and Federal
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) community, defined three additional
sets of security control baselines that extend the existing NIST security control
baselines46 for low-,47 moderate-,48 and high-impact49 cloud-based information
systems. As will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, The FedRAMP Cloud
Computing Security Requirements, these minimum security controls have been
tailored and supplemented to establish a standardized set of security requirements
considered to provide adequate protection for federal information within cloud
computing environments. In addition to the initial tailoring of the NIST security
control baselines by the JAB (i.e., applying the scoping guidance and specifying
government-wide organization-defined parameters), CSPs also have the responsi-
bility for completing additional tailoring for the application of security controls
that may differ from the FedRAMP security control requirements (i.e., specifying
compensating security controls). For example, in Table 8.12, the security controls
selection process (NIST RMF Step 2) maps to one additional FedRAMP deliver-
able: Control Implementation Summary (CIS).
The CIS is used by the CSPs to document “control implementation responsi-
bility and implementation status of the FedRAMP security controls. The scope of
the CIS template includes a description of all management, operational, and tech-
nical FedRAMP security controls that are documented in the SSP at the deter-
mined impact level (Moderate or Low) by the CSP” [14].
NOTE
Initiating a Request
Initiating a request,50 is the initial steps for CSPs and involves completing a brief request form
that provides a summary of information on the CSP and the cloud service to include:
•
CSP Name.
•
CSP Website.
•
CSP Points of Contact.

technical controls that are employed in the hardware, software, or firmware com-
ponents of the information system” [7]. The SSP describes the controls implemen-
ted, and also provides a method for communicating to the JAB those security
controls that have been planned or compensated by the CSP.
Before the security control implementations can be described, the CSP needs
to identify the information system components included within the operating envi-
ronment. Since cloud environments can be configured differently and encompass
different layers (e.g., a single provider operates the IaaS layer, a single or differ-
ent provider operates the IaaS and PaaS layers, or a single provider operates all
layers or only the SaaS layer), it is important for the CSP to accurately reflect the
security control boundary layer to ensure gaps do not exist between each layer.
TIP
The FedRAMP PMO identified the following list of questions [13] to assist CSPs in describing
the scope of the boundary for their cloud service. Below is a subset of those questions:
•
Does the cloud service leverage an existing provisional authorization?
•
Do tenants share the same virtual LANs (VLAN(s))?
•
Are virtual machine zones isolated on unique network segments?
•
Are separate physical network adapters used to isolate virtual machine zones?
•
Is layer-2 isolation performed?
•
Are firewalls used to provide isolation between tenants?
•
Are router access control lists (ACLs) used to provide isolation between tenants?
•
Are network zones used, and if so, how are those zones defined?
•
Do you have the capability to identify the geographic location where the customer data is stored?
•
Do you have the capability for a federal agency customer to identify the geographic location
where its data are stored?
•
Is live migration used, and if so, is it performed manually or automatically?
•
If live migration is automated, what rules are used to govern the migration?
Identified below are the outputs from the steps included within the SAF docu-
ment phase when documenting security controls.
Major Milestone Outputs
Documentation of the security controls implemented in the cloud service as
included within the approved baseline security controls allocated and described in
the SSP and supporting documentation.
Assess Phase
In this step of the SAF phase, as outlined in Table 8.13, the CSP works directly
with a contracted accredited51 3PAO. The 3PAO is responsible for performing an
independent and qualified assessment of the security controls using the artifacts

included in the security assessment package. The assessment-related activities
performed in this step are consistent with those included within the NIST RMF
Step 4 and involve a collaborative relationship between the CSP and the 3PAO to
ensure assessor independence is maintained. The output of this task involves mak-
ing a determination of the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
operate as intended, and produce the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
FedRAMP security requirements [7].
Major Milestone Outputs
•
Approved security assessment plan used to assess the security control
employed within or inherited by the cloud service.
•
SAR that identifies the findings and recommendations based on an assessment
of the security controls implemented within the cloud service.
•
Plan of action and milestones (POA&Ms) that include remediation action for
correcting weaknesses and deficiencies in the cloud service.
Authorize Phase
The next phase in the SAF, as outlined in Table 8.14, is the assembly of the docu-
mentation by the CSP into a security authorization package that includes the
Supplier’s Declaration of Conformation.52 In addition to the authorization activi-
ties included in NIST RMF Step 4, the CSP also has responsibility in

documenting a remediation plan (or POA&Ms),53 which is performed in NIST
RMF Step 5. After reviewing the security assessment report (SAR) generated by
the 3PAO, the CSP is required to prepare POA&Ms54 that require establishing the
tasks, resources required to complete the task, and the schedule for remediating
any findings of weaknesses and deficiencies. The 3PAO SAR and the POA&Ms
are two of the three key documents in the security authorization package submit-
ted and reviewed by the JAB when making a risk-based decision for granting a
provisional authorization.
The JAB reviews the security authorization package and makes the final risk-
based decision when granting a provisional authorization. This risk determination
is based on an accumulation of risk-related information that is used by the JAB
when assessing the risk to the federal government when using the cloud service.

Major Milestone Output
•
Security assessment package that includes the key documents used in making
an authorization decision—the SSP, SAR, and POA&Ms.
•
Provisional ATO letter55 that includes the risk determination and acceptance
decision by the JAB for cloud service.
Leveraging the ATO
Leveraging is an authorization approach,56 previously discussed in Chapter 5,
Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework, which is used when one
federal agency accepts the authorization package of another federal agency.
The leveraging federal agency’s AO reviews and accepts the risk based on a
determination of the risk for using the cloud service to support their specific
mission and business processes and use the cloud service to store, process, or
transmit their information. In this FedRAMP phase, the final acceptance of
risk (or ATO) is granted by the leveraging federal agency57 accepting the
provisional ATO for cloud service. This includes the agreement of the control
responsibility as allocated by the CSPs in the CIS, as discussed earlier in this
chapter.
Monitor Phase
In the final phase, ongoing assessment and authorization (also known as contin-
uous monitoring), the JAB determines if the security controls implemented are
still effective and the provisional authorization should be maintained.58 This
determination is based on three keys areas: operational visibility, change control
process, and incident response. The operational visibility focuses on periodic
assessment of a select subset of security controls to ensure security controls
implemented by CSPs continue to be effective. The change control process
relates to the CSPs’ ability to understand security impacts associated with
changes to the cloud service. Incident response focuses on identifying new
threats
and
vulnerabilities
and

response
and

activities

the CSPs authorization.”
56Three authorization approaches are available by AOs when conducting authorizations: (1) tradi-
tional single AO ATO, (2) multiple AO ATO, and (3) leveraged ATO.

incidences. Continuous monitoring will be discussed in detail in later chapters.
However, in this section, a high-level overview will be provided as it relates to
the FedRAMP SAF.
Operational Visibility
Operational visibility focuses on three sources of information for determining
the security and risk posture of cloud services to demonstrate continued
compliance through the automation to enable oversight and monitoring.
Originally included in the reporting instructions59 to federal agencies in April
2010, a three-tiered approach60 was introduced as a method for federal agencies
to
effectively
and
“continuously
monitor
security-related
information
across the enterprise in a manageable and actionable way” [8]. To enable
near-real-time
monitoring,
CyberScope
was
introduced
as
the
platform
for submitting data feeds (automated and manual) and to enable OMB and
DHS61 to conduct government-wide benchmarking through a set of questions/
metrics62 that describe each on the federal agencies’ security posture.
As part of the continuous monitoring requirements, CSPs are required to sub-
mit similar types of data elements to federal agencies to use in meeting their
reporting requirements and to give the FedRAMP PMO operational visibility into
the security posture of cloud services. In addition, CSPs are required to conduct
an annual re-assessment of a subset of the security controls identified in the
FedRAMP baseline and submit an annual self-attestation report.
Change Control
Changes to an operational environment are inevitable as a system undergoes
routine maintenance. However, some changes may cause significant impacts
to the security posture of the cloud service.63 Therefore, the CSP is required

the CSP’s risk posture, changes to any applications residing on the cloud
system, and/or changes to the cloud system infrastructure” [6], and submit
any residual artifacts associated with significant changes such as the SSP,
security impacts analysis, and a re-assessment by a 3PAO to the FedRAMP
PMO.
Incident Response
Incident response plans ensure there is bilateral communication on incidents
between the CSP and the federal government. Depending on the type of incident
and the scope of the impact, a single incident could impact multiple federal agen-
cies leveraging the cloud service [9]. The notification of incidents and coordina-
tion with the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)64
and federal agency Security Operations Centers (SOCs) ensures that there is a
managed response and escalation of incidences.
THIRD PARTY ASSESSMENT ORGANIZATION PROGRAM
Conformity assessments65 are not new to the federal government. As discussed in

security assessment process” [10]. The conformity assessment process70 gives the
federal government the confidence of the security in using cloud services through:
•
the conformance with an established set of security standards and
requirements;
•
a consistently applied security assessment process; and
•
the use of a structured approach when granting provisional ATOs.
In the FedRAMP process, the 3PAO71 plays a critical role in providing the
FedRAMP JAB with an independent evaluation (or inspection72) to ensure
that the cloud service meets FedRAMP security requirements through a con-
formity assessment73 process. To ensure that assessments of cloud services are
conducted in a unified and standard approach, enabling a “do once, use many times”
approach, organizations conducting the security assessments will need to be accre-
dited to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements of independence and
competence.74
TIP
Independent assessors or assessment teams must be capable of conducting an impartial
assessment. What qualifies an assessor or assessment team as being capable of presenting results
in a manner that would enable the JAB in making a “credible, risk-based decision” is determined
through the 3PAO program. In addition to the 3PAO program, “CSPs should establish minimum

SUMMARY
In this chapter, FedRAMP was introduced through a detailed discussion of the
program goals and objectives, and its role in supporting the secure adoption of
cloud computing services. The program’s governing documents (i.e., Policy
Memo, RAR, SAF) provide insight into how the program operates. In addition,
the primary stakeholders were also briefly discussed as it relates to their roles
and responsibilities for the governance and execution of FedRAMP phases. The
FedRAMP Accelerated process was presented, which includes a readiness (capa-
bilities) assessment or “pre-audit” to determine if a CSP is “FedRAMP Ready.”
Through a review of the FedRAMP phases defined within the FedRAMP SAF, a
mapping to NIST RMF provides context into the similarities and differences
between the FedRAMP implementation of those processes defined in NIST stan-
dards and guidance references. Finally, the FedRAMP 3PAO program was intro-
duced highlighting the role of the 3PAO in ensuring CSPs are in conformance
with the FedRAMP security and privacy requirements.

SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Joint
Authorization Board (JAB) selected security controls from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 low, moderate,
and high security control baselines and supplemented with additional security controls
and enhancements to address the unique risks to cloud computing environments. These
risks included multitenancy, visibility, control/responsibility, shared resource pooling,
and trust [1]. The FedRAMP security control baselines were developed through a
multistep process focused on defining a standardized set of security requirements for
the cost-effective, authorization of cloud services for use by the federal government.
As discussed in Chapter 5, Applying the NIST Risk Management Framework, the
security control selection process involves the application of three steps:
•
Selecting the initial security control baseline.
•
Tailoring the security control baseline.
•
Supplementing the security control baseline.
Since the FedRAMP program is meant to be a consistent, government-wide
approach to security assessment and authorization, the final security control base-
lines creates a government-wide overlay1 that identifies specific security require-
ments for “cloud-based information systems that are uniformly applied to all
federal agencies procuring or implementing cloud services” [2].

SELECTING THE SECURITY CONTROL BASELINE
The FedRAMP security control baselines operates at the low-, moderate-, or high-impact
level, where low, moderate, and high categorization is equally applied across all of the
security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) for the cloud service.
For cloud services applying the FedRAMP low baseline, the security control
baseline was developed based on the following security categorization:
SECURITY CATEGORY cloud service5 {(confidentiality, low), (integrity, low), (availability, low)}
where the value for potential impact to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability is low.
For cloud services applying the FedRAMP moderate baseline, the security
control baseline was developed based on following security categorization:
SECURITY CATEGORY cloud service 5 {(confidentiality, moderate), (integrity, moderate),
(availability, moderate)}
where the value for potential impact to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability is moderate.
For cloud services applying the FedRAMP high baseline, the security control
baseline was developed based on following security categorization:
SECURITY CATEGORY cloud service5 {(confidentiality, high), (integrity, high), (availability, high)}
where the value for potential impact to the loss of confidentiality, integrity,
and availability is high.
TAILORING AND SUPPLEMENTING SECURITY CONTROL BASELINE
The FedRAMP security control baselines2 were developed through the application
of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)3 tailoring process. As dis-
cussed previously, the tailoring process is the second step of the security control
selection process and includes the assignment of specific values to the
organization-defined
security
control
parameters.4

the security control selection process.”
3Chapter 5 discussed the risk management activities involved in the application of the Risk
Management Framework (RMF).
4From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4,
Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information System and Organizations. Maryland: National
Institute of Standards and Technology; 2013. “Organizations may choose to define specific values for
security control parameters in policies, procedures, or guidance (which may be applicable to more
than one information system) referencing the source documents in the security plan in lieu of explicitly
completing the assignment/selection statements within the control as part of the plan.”
270
CHAPTER 9 The FedRAMP cloud computing security requirements

included within NIST SP 800-53, Appendix F—Security Control Catalog, have
embedded parameters5 that are designed to provide flexibility when defining the
specification for the security control and enhancement(s) necessary to support the
definition of government-wide security requirements for the secure use of cloud
computing services.
After the initial security control baseline was tailored, the FedRAMP JAB sup-
plemented the baseline with additional security controls and enhancements identi-
fied as necessary to sufficiently protect federal information within a cloud
computing environment. In addition to the requirements defined in the FedRAMP
security controls, the FedRAMP JAB defined additional requirements through
security control addendum [2].
FEDRAMP CLOUD COMPUTING OVERLAY
The FedRAMP cloud computing overlay6 is a government-wide set of security
controls that are based on a focused look at the security capabilities and require-
ments needed to protect federal information within low-, moderate-, and high-
impact cloud services. The application of an overlay does not limit Cloud Service
Providers (CSPs) or federal agencies from tailoring or supplementing the
FedRAMP security control baselines, rather it creates a “community-wide or spe-
cialized set of security controls for information system and organizations” [2]
based on a consensus7 of those within the community that the requirements
should be broadly applied to multiple information systems (and cloud services)
that meet a specific target characteristic (i.e., the FedRAMP control baselines can
be further refined based on a specific service or deployment model).

vide organizations with the capability to specialize security controls and control enhancements
based on organizational security requirements or requirements originating in federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines. Organization-defined
parameters used in assignment and selection statements in the basic security controls apply also to
all control enhancements associated with those controls.”

Security Control Selection Process

FEDRAMP CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
The FedRAMP “Policy Memo,” as discussed in Chapter 8, FedRAMP Primer, is the
overarching policy that covers all commercial and noncommercial cloud services,
including all cloud deployment and service models with the exception8 of a private
cloud operating on-premise, and which provides services to only the owning organi-
zation (i.e., no external users, including other organizational entities within the same
federal agency). Since CSPs can operate as either a public (i.e., federal or state gov-
ernment) or private sector organization, or both, potentially complex cloud relation-
ships can be created where security control assignment and ownership can be difficult
to determine. Therefore, all stakeholders should participate in planning and coordinat-
ing the development of cloud-specific contracts (or other end user agreements).9
The scope of the contracts (or agreements) should provide a clear definition of
the governance over the cloud service environment (i.e., the policies, procedures,
standards, guidelines, and roles and responsibilities that would be applied).
In addition, the contracts (or agreements) should provide a clear delineation of
the security control responsibility,10 similar to Fig. 9.1, including any applicable
FIGURE 9.1
Security control responsibilities [3].

statutes, policies, and regulations; and compliance should be defined before a contract award. This
may be done through a separate document or be included in the actual contract.”

CHAPTER 9 The FedRAMP cloud computing security requirements

policies and procedures that would satisfy the requirements for the security con-
trols. As an example, the FedRAMP Security Assessment Framework (SAF),
requires CSPs to submit information security policies governing their cloud ser-
vice, as described in the System Security Plan (SSP),11 to the FedRAMP PMO as
part of the FedRAMP security authorization process.
The delineation should include any applicable policies and procedures
that would apply to the implementation of the FedRAMP security controls.
Since CSPs are required to submit information security policies and procedures
governing their cloud service as described in the FedRAMP SSP12 template
to the FedRAMP PMO as part of the FedRAMP security authorization
process, CSPs should at minimum have established security policies that
govern all of FedRAMP security requirements that are applicable to their cloud
service layer.
The assignment of responsibility for security controls is an essential activity
that requires identifying situations where there is potential shared responsibilities
(or hybrid controls). For example, a CSP may implement the Incident Response
Policy and Procedures security control (IR-1) as a hybrid control with the policy
portion of the control deemed to be common and applied as a corporate responsi-
bility, and the procedures portion of the control deemed to be system-specific [2].
The FedRAMP PMO established the Control Implementation Summary (CIS)
document to be completed by the CSP to aid in communicating the ownership
and responsibility of the security controls between the CSP and the federal agency
customer.
POLICY AND PROCEDURES

highest-level senior executive within an organization (e.g., head of the federal
agency, chief executive officer) with the overall responsibility to provide for the
information security protections and to ensure the development, implementation,

and maintenance of information security policies, procedures, and control techni-
ques. The policies, procedures, and control techniques must address all applicable
requirements, including those issued by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) and the NIST, except where authority is delegated to other organizations
(e.g., the Secretary of Defense for US Department of Defense (DoD) information
systems).
In each of the security control families (e.g., security assessment and authori-
zation, configuration management, access control), the first control, identified
as the “XX-1” security controls, requires the development of security policies14
that address the requirements that must be implemented within information
system or by the organization.15 The CSP’s security policies should include at
minimum the purpose16 of the policy, the scope,17 the roles and responsibilities,18
and compliance.19 The FedRAMP “Policy Memo”20 issued by the OMB defines

the government-wide security program,21 and the security and authorization pol-
icy for addressing the security and authorization of cloud computing environ-
ments. Through the implementation of an information security program plan,22
the organization can effectively centralize those security controls deemed inde-
pendent of a particular cloud service and instead manage them as part of the over-
arching information security program.
TIP
Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures
To assist CSPs and federal agencies in implementing policies, standards, guidelines, and
procedures should be used. Standards and guidelines, such as those developed by NIST under a
statutory responsibility, establish minimum requirements promulgated from legislative mandates
“to support the implementation of and compliance with FISMA” [4]. Whereas other standards and
guidelines such as the NIST SPs, Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Security Technical
Implementation Guides (STIGs),23 or National Security Agency (NSA) Information Assurance
(IA) Mitigation Guidelines24 focus on providing specific methods or techniques for ensuring the
security of a solution. Standards and guidelines can focus on a general concept such as server
security,25 secure communication26 or secure operations,27 while others may target a specific
technology (i.e., virtualization28 or IPv629) or security feature (i.e., encryption30 or security
automation31). Procedures are more scoped to the operating environment (i.e., operational
personnel, facility, and system operations) and provide the detailed steps that address how the
policies, standards, and guidelines are applied within an operational context such as credential
management or performing audit log management.

FedRAMP Cloud Computing Security Requirements

HARMONIZING FEDRAMP REQUIREMENTS
The FedRAMP “Policy Memo” established a standard set of security requirements
that would be used for the authorization and ongoing continuous monitoring of
cloud services.32 In addition, the FedRAMP security requirements could be sup-
plemented with additional federal agency-specific security and privacy require-
ments, or even incur changes through updates to NIST SP 800-53 and by the
JAB33 review process. Therefore, a harmonization governance process,34 similar
to Fig. 9.2, may be used by the FedRAMP PMO to maintain and elicit changes to
the
FedRAMP
security
controls,
to
include
changes
in
security
control
requirements.

CHAPTER 9 The FedRAMP cloud computing security requirements

Through a continual review process35 input from multiple sources can be used
by the JAB to harmonize the FedRAMP security controls as part of a review and
adjudication. Example input could include feedback from federal agencies on the
adequacy of the FedRAMP security control requirements, an evaluation by JAB
Technical Representatives (TRs) of CSP environments, or the reconciliation with
federal agency-specific security and privacy requirements. In addition, all federal
agencies (and contractors)36 are required to be in compliance with NIST publica-
tions37 one year38 date of publication. Therefore, changes to the NIST SP 800-53
could also require changes and updates to the FedRAMP security controls.
ASSURANCE OF EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS COMPLIANCE
FISMA requires agencies to provide security protections “...commensurate with
the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
disruption, modification, or destruction of information collected or maintained by
or on behalf of the agency; and information systems used or operated by an agency
or other organization on behalf of an agency” [6]. In addition, OMB requires fed-
eral agencies to ensure appropriate information security oversight capabilities exist
for contractors and other users with privileged access to federal data and systems.
CSPs, regardless of the deployment and service model, are required to meet the
same requirements when processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or
are operating on behalf of the federal government. The integration of FedRAMP
security requirements into the terms and conditions of contracts and service-
level agreements (SLAs),39 provides a mechanism when defining roles and responsi-
bilities. The FedRAMP PMO provides standard contract clauses,40 control-specific

requirements [3]. Although CSPs are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
FedRAMP security requirements, the overall responsibility for mitigating risks in
using cloud services is retained with the federal agency customer.
NOTE
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) covers the acquisition of IT supplies and services used
by federal agencies. The requirements within the FAR include applicable provisions with
references to address information security and privacy as part of the acquisition process. These
requirements include the following:
•
FAR 7.103(u)—“Ensuring that agency planners on information technology acquisitions
comply with the information technology security requirements in the Federal Information
Security Management Act (44 US C. 3544), OMB’s implementing policies including
Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130, and guidance and standards from the Department of
Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology” [7].
•
FAR 11.102—“Agencies shall select existing requirements documents or develop new
requirements documents that meet the needs of the agency in accordance with the guidance
contained in the Federal Standardization Manual, FSPM-0001; for DoD components, DoD
4120.24-M, Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures; and for IT standards
and guidance, the Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS)” [8].
•
FAR 39.101(d)—“In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include the appropriate
information technology security policies and requirements, including use of common security
configurations available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s website at
http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting officers should consult with the requiring official
to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated” [9].
•
FAR 52.239-1(a)—“Contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the
Contracting Officer’s written consent, the details of any safeguards either designed or
developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise provided by the Government.”43
•
FAR 52.239-1(b)—“To the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to safeguard
against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government data,
the Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor’s facilities, installations,
technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases.”44
•
FAR 52.239-1(c)—“If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the
Government or the Contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the
discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party.”45

CHAPTER 9 The FedRAMP cloud computing security requirements

APPROACHES TO IMPLEMENTING FEDRAMP SECURITY CONTROLS
Decisions made as part of the security control selection process are driven by the
organization’s determination of the adequate protection for a given information
system within a target operating environment. The decisions made during the risk
management activities aid in establishing the risk-based information such as
assumptions, constraints, and rationale needed for addressing security within the
information system. This information supports the implementation of security
controls based on a risk-based approach that requires an understanding of the
potential impacts to the organization’s mission or business processes and those
organizations that rely upon the information system. The potential impact is based
on the compromise of one or more security objectives46 (i.e., loss of confidential-
ity, integrity, or availability).
Some information systems are in the development process (i.e., new develop-
ment), while others may already be in production (i.e., legacy). Depending on the
state of the information system, security controls may be part of the initial
requirements definition or applied as part of the change management function. If
the information system is in the development process, the integration of security
controls can be applied as part of the normal system development life cycle
(SDLC).47 However, if the information system is already in production, a gap
analysis approach can be used to assist the organization in fully understanding
what is in-place and what additional security controls will need to be applied to
address the differences in the requirements gap. In some circumstances, compen-
sating security controls may even need to be identified and applied where existing
security controls that are already in-place have been determined to be insufficient
to effectively mitigate potential risks.
CSPs can apply similar techniques when implementing the FedRAMP security
controls. Since cloud environments may present different risks than traditional IT
environments, the CSP should conduct an additional analysis to identify where
the gap exists (i.e., within the different cloud service models and technology
implementations) and who has the overall responsibility (CSP or federal agency)
for addressing the weaknesses or deficiencies. As an example, Fig. 9.3 illustrates
a high-level gap analysis exercise CSPs could use to identify the gaps in their
security capabilities and features based on what is built-in.
46From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision
4 (Initial Public Draft), Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information System and
Organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2012. “Security controls
are typically deployed as a unified set to achieve a desired security capability. The loss of one
security objective (e.g. integrity) can adversely affect the other objectives (e.g. confidentiality and
availability). When selecting security controls for nondisclosure purposes, organizations consider
the security categorization of user data and system-level data—where system data may require
stronger protection in the form of additional security controls.”

Development Life Cycle. Available from: http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpu-

FIGURE 9.3
Cloud security reference model [10].

The gap analysis exercise includes the following three steps [10]:
1. Classifying the service against cloud model (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS).
2. Map the existing security architecture against the cloud model.
3. Map the FedRAMP security requirements (identified as the compliance
model) against the security architecture and the cloud model.
Using the steps in the gap analysis exercise, CSPs can use the preliminary
information to complete the first three steps of the NIST RMF,48 including deter-
mining the potential gaps in achieving the target FedRAMP security control base-
lines (low-, moderate-, or high-impact) based on their own application of the
information

process
when
completing
the
Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 worksheet. In addition, this informa-
tion can help them begin the process of documenting the CIS, as discussed in
Chapter 8, FedRAMP Primer.
TIP
Some CSPs have already aligned with other regulatory or industry control frameworks such as
ISO/IEC 27001/27002, ISACA COBIT, PCI DSS, and NIST 800-53. Therefore the Cloud Security
Alliance (CSA) Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)49 provides an industry consensus framework that
has been developed as a tool,50 for use by CSPs to integrate FedRAMP into their existing
integrated security framework and to assist CSPs in conducting a crosswalk to determine the
differences in their existing security and compliance program with the FedRAMP security
requirements.
FEDRAMP SECURITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
The FedRAMP security control requirements provide the minimum security con-
trol baseline requirements for cloud computing environments. These security con-
trols were based on the minimum assurance requirements included in the NIST
SP 800-53 [2] and the FedRAMP Security Controls [11]. Table 9.1 provides sum-
mary of the security controls assigned to each of the security control baselines
(low, moderate, and high) based on impact.
48Chapter 5 discussed the risk management activities involved in the application of the Risk
Management Framework (RMF).

FEDERAL LAWS, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, POLICIES,
DIRECTIVES, REGULATIONS, STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
The security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are designed to
facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Compliance is not about adhering
to static checklists or generating unnecessary FISMA reporting paperwork.
Rather, compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with regard
to information security and risk management. Information security due diligence
includes using all appropriate information as part of an organization-wide risk
management program to effectively use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexi-
bility in NIST publications so that the selected security controls documented in
organizational security plans meet the mission and business requirements of orga-
nizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are available to
organizations is essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the safe-
guards and countermeasures with the necessary and sufficient strength of mecha-
nism to address the current threats to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based
processes, procedures, and technologies will help ensure that all federal informa-
tion systems and organizations have the necessary resilience to support ongoing
federal responsibilities, critical infrastructure applications, and continuity of gov-
ernment. [2]

SUMMARY
This chapter provided a detailed discussion of the FedRAMP security controls,
including the security selection process used by the JAB. In addition, specific
issues regarding roles and responsibilities were highlighted as it relates to the
delineation of responsibility for security controls and situations where shared
responsibilities would require defining the scope that would need to be addressed
in governing policies and procedures. The governance and maintenance of the
FedRAMP security requirements were briefly discussed, focusing on the applica-
tion of a harmonizing process to incorporate industry feedback and agency-
specific security and privacy. Finally, the FedRAMP security control requirements
were described, to include potential approaches for implementing the security
controls, both in existing or new cloud services with an emphasis on applying a
gap analysis or integrating them through a traditional SDLC.

INTRODUCTION TO SECURITY TESTING
Security testing is one type of assessment method1 used for determining if the
information system being assessed meets the security objectives.2 Security testing
as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is the
“process of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified conditions
to compare actual with expected behavior, the results of which are used to
support the determination of security control existence, functionality, correctness,
completeness, and potential for improvement over time” [1]. Security testing can
be used to determine if technical mechanisms or organizational activities meet a
set of predefined specifications or can be used to evaluate security controls to
determine if they can be circumvented.3
Security testing can be conducted using manual or automated techniques.
Both testing techniques have advantages and disadvantages. Manual security testing
is not only time-consuming; it can also be more expensive than automated testing.
Automated testing uses tools to execute tests and automate tasks, thereby improving
the efficiency of security testing. Automated tools can also improve the time to
1Testing, examination, and interviewing.

Publication (SP) 800-53A Revision 4, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal
Information Systems and organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology;
2014. “Penetration testing is a specific type of assessment in which assessors simulate the actions
of a given class of attacker by using a defined set of documentation (that is, the documentation
representative of what that class of attacker is likely to possess) and working under other specific
constraints to attempt to circumvent the security features of an information system.”

complete security testing, and can be more frequently updated based on new types
of vulnerabilities and exploits. However, automated security testing reduces the
types of testing techniques (e.g., social engineering4) that can be performed
based on the limitation of automated tools to mimic human behavior. Therefore,
both manually and automated testing should be considered against the depth and
coverage required for the security testing.
TIP
Security testing can be differentiated by the depth5 and coverage6 of the testing conducted.
Depth and coverage are factors in the level of effort and the rigor and scope of the security
testing.
Depth
The three values for the depth attribute are [1]:
•
Basic testing: Test methodology (also known as black box testing) that assumes no
knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object.
This type of testing is conducted using a functional specification for mechanisms and a
high-level process description for activities. Basic testing provides a level of understanding
of the security controls necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented and
free of obvious errors.
•
Focused testing: Test methodology (also known as gray box testing) that assumes some
knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. This type
of testing is conducted using a functional specification and limited system architectural
information (e.g., high-level design) for mechanisms and a high-level process description and
high-level description of integration into the operational environment for activities. Focused
testing provides a level of understanding of the security controls necessary for determining
whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are increased
grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating as intended.
•
Comprehensive testing: Test methodology (also known as white box testing) that assumes
explicit and substantial knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the
assessment object. This type of testing is conducted using a functional specification, extensive

Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. “Social engineering is an attempt to trick someone
into revealing information (e.g., a password) that can be used to attack systems or networks. It is
used to test the human element and user awareness of security, and can reveal weaknesses in user
behavior—such as failing to follow standard procedures.”

detail associated with the application of the method.”

system architectural information (e.g., high-level design, low-level design) and implementation
representation (e.g., source code, schematics) for mechanisms, and a high-level process
description and detailed description of integration into the operational environment for
activities. Comprehensive testing provides a level of understanding of the security controls
necessary for determining whether the controls are implemented and free of obvious errors
and whether there are further increased grounds for confidence that the controls are
implemented correctly and operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis,
and that there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness of the controls.
Coverage
The three values for the coverage attribute are [1]:
•
Basic testing: Testing that uses a representative sample of assessment objects (by type and
number within type) to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the
security controls are implemented and free of obvious errors.
•
Focused testing: Testing that uses a representative sample of assessment objects (by type and
number within type) and other specific assessment objects deemed particularly important to
achieving the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining
whether the security controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there
are increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented correctly and operating
as intended.
•
Comprehensive testing: Testing that uses a sufficiently large sample of assessment objects
(by type and number within type) and other specific assessment objects deemed particularly
important to achieving the assessment objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for
determining whether the security controls are implemented and free of obvious errors and
whether there are further increased grounds for confidence that the controls are implemented
correctly and operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is
support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness of the controls.
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
The purpose of a vulnerability assessment (scanning) is to examine an information
system or product, with the intent of identifying inadequate security measures and
vulnerabilities.7 In addition to vulnerabilities, vulnerability assessments can also
include network discovery, network port, and service identification.8 These types

mentation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.”

using a port scanner to identify network ports and services operating on active hosts—such as FTP
and HTTP—and the application that is running each identified service, such as Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) or Apache for the HTTP service.”

attempts to simulate a specific attack to exploit vulnerabilities in the target environ-
ment. Although, vulnerability assessments can help to inform a penetration test,
they are often performed on a more regular basis to provide an initial prioritized
list of vulnerabilities or used as part of the deployment of new information systems
or products. The results of a vulnerability assessment include not only the vulner-
abilities identified, but also the information on how to remediate discovered
vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability scanning9 can be performed on operating systems, network
devices, databases, and web applications and custom software,10 depending on
the types of tools used and the scope of the assessment. During the vulnerability
scanning,
target
hosts
are
identified
and
information
about
the
hosts
are collected11 for analysis (e.g., operating system type, installed applications,
and open ports). The analysis12 of the information collected from vulnerability
scanning can be evaluated manually through human interpretation or auto-
matically through the vulnerability scanner13 to assist in identifying outdated
software, missing patches, misconfigurations, and policy compliance rules.

Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and privacy controls for federal information systems
and organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2013. “Vulnerability
scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, pro-
tocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improp-
erly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.”

Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. “Application security can be assessed in a number of
ways, ranging from source code review to penetration testing of the implemented application.”
11Credentialed (or authenticated) vulnerability assessments can extract vulnerability information
from the host using those credentials; whereas noncredentialed vulnerability assessments only look
at network services exposed by the host (i.e., do not provide all known operating system and appli-
cation vulnerabilities).

Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. “A useful resource to reference throughout the analy-
sis phase is the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). NVD is a database that contains
information on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), a list of standardized names for
known vulnerabilities. The NVD scores vulnerabilities with the Common Vulnerability Scoring
System (CVSS) and provides additional information regarding the vulnerability and additional
resources to reference for mitigation recommendations (e.g., vendor Web sites).”

CHAPTER 10 Security testing: vulnerability and penetration testing

Vulnerability assessments reports produced from vulnerability scanners may
utilize different methods to score14 vulnerabilities, resulting in different risk levels
for the same vulnerability. Additionally, vulnerability scanners only identify and
report vulnerabilities on a host-by-host basis and do not take into account the
environment in which the vulnerability resides. Reliance on vulnerability scanners
to evaluate and report results to assign risk would need to be weighed against the
potential for vulnerabilities identified on individual hosts to be assigned a lower
or higher risk level than would actually exist. Therefore, some human interpreta-
tion would be required in appropriately evaluating and assigning risk levels for
vulnerabilities identified, rather than relying solely on the risk levels assigned by
the vulnerability scanner.
The security categorization15 of the information system guides the frequency and
comprehensiveness,16 and the type of information system components to be included
in a vulnerability assessment. Additionally, the location, exposure, and criticality of
the information system components also helps inform the vulnerability assessment.
For example, a vulnerability scan of a public facing web application may require a
different approach than an internal web application, which is not publically accessi-
ble. Further, vulnerability scanning of custom software application17 may require a
different approach than a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software application.
NOTE
NIST Special Publication 800-53 has established a requirement for a low, moderate, and high-
impact information systems to include regularly and/or random vulnerability scanning as part of
the security practices. In this section, the specific vulnerability scanning requirements are
presented for information system categorized as low, moderate, or high in accordance with
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199.
(Continued)
14The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) was developed to provide a way to
characterize vulnerabilities and score them using a standardized method through a common algo-
rithm to produce a severity rating. CVSS uses three metrics groups to characterize a vulnerability
(base, temporal, and environmental); however, only the base metric groups examines the exploit-
ability and impact of vulnerabilities. For more information on CVSS, visit https://www.first.org/
cvss.

categorization process in the application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF).

800-115, Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment. Maryland: National
Institute of Standards and Technology; 2008. “Most vulnerability scanners allow the assessor to
perform different levels of scanning that vary in terms of thoroughness. While more comprehensive
scanning may detect a greater number of vulnerabilities, it can slow the overall scanning process.
Less comprehensive scanning can take less time, but identifies only well-known vulnerabilities.”

Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and privacy controls for federal information systems

analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis,
dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches.”

Vulnerability Assessment

NOTE (CONTINUED)
Low, Moderate, or High Security Category
RA-5 vulnerability scanning:
The organization:
a. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined
process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are
identified and reported.
b. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among
tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
3. Measuring vulnerability impact.
c. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments.
d. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in
accordance with an organizational assessment of risk.
e. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control
assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate
similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
Moderate, or High Security Category
RA-5 (1) Vulnerability Scanning | Update Tool Capability
The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily
update the information system vulnerabilities to be scanned.
RA-5 (2) Vulnerability Scanning | Update by Frequency/Prior to New Scan/When Identified
The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned organization-defined
frequency prior to a new scan, or when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.
RA-5 (5) Vulnerability Scanning | Privileged Access
The information system implements privileged access authorization to organization-identified
information system components for selected organization-defined vulnerability scanning activities.
High Security Category
RA-5 (4) Vulnerability Scanning | Discoverable Information
The organization determines what information about the information system is discoverable by
adversaries and subsequently takes organization-defined corrective actions.
The overall outcome of the vulnerability assessment should be identifying sources
of potential vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities should be analyzed to inform the
vulnerability management program of which vulnerabilities need to be patched or
mitigated. The vulnerability management program should focus on characterizing and
prioritizing the vulnerabilities to prevent attackers from not only compromising a host
or device, but also use of the compromised host or device to in turn compromise other
hosts or devices (also known as “lateral movement”18). As presented in Table 10.1,

General Services Administration; 2015. “Perform further discovery and enumeration to identify
hosts on the network that may only respond to the compromised system. Leverage compromised
systems and credentials to pivot to additional hosts with the intent of gaining unauthorized access
to management systems.”

CHAPTER 10 Security testing: vulnerability and penetration testing

Table 10.1 Description of the Attacks Steps [2]
Attack Step
Attacker Action
Defender Action
1. Gain internal entry
The attacker is outside the target boundaries and
seeks entry.
Examples include: Spear phishing email sent;
DDoS attack against gov. initiated.
• Limit attacks or negative events from even initiating in, or
having the ability to impact, the local environment.
Examples include: Multifactor authentication; SPAM filters;
access control lists for routers/firewalls; link encryption and
virtual private networks (VPNs); authoritative Domain Name
System (DNS) to prevent poisoning; gateway level
antimalware applications.
2. Initiate attack internally
The attacker is inside the boundary and initiates
attack on some object internally.
Examples include: User opens spear phishing
email or clicks on attachment; laptop lost or stolen;
user installs unauthorized software or hardware.
• Limit initiating condition from occurring in local environment.
Examples include: Educating users not to click on
attachments; maintaining positive control of assets;
restricting privileges for software installation or removable
media.
• Limit precipitating event from resulting in attack.
Examples include: Preventing automatic execution of code
on removable media; educating users not to share
passwords; educating users not to send unencrypted
personally identifiable information (PII) outside of the
enterprise; host-level antimalware applications that blocks
before execution.
3. Gain foothold
The attacker has gained entry to the object and
achieves enough actual compromise to gain a
foothold, but without persistence.
Examples include: Unauthorized user successfully
logs in with authorized credentials; browser exploit
code successfully executed in memory and call back
initiated; person gains unauthorized access to server
room.
• Limit vulnerable conditions that attack/threat exploits.
Examples include: Patching; implementation of common
secure configurations.
• Limit successful completion of exploitation attempt.
Examples include: DEP (data execution prevention);
recompiling techniques; removing default passwords and
accounts; multifactor authentication; disabling accounts;
redundant communication paths.
• Limit successful foothold on object.
Examples include: Detect attempts; blocking access
attempts to known bad DNS domains; reviewing audit and
event logs.
(Continued)

Table 10.1 Description of the Attacks Steps [2] Continued
Attack Step
Attacker Action
Defender Action
4. Gain persistence
The attack has gained a foothold on the object and
now achieves persistence.
Examples include: Malware installed on host that
survives reboot or log off; Basic Input/Output
System (BIOS) or kernel modified; new/privileged
account created for unauthorized user; unauthorized
person issued credentials/allowed access.
• Limit persistent compromise of asset.
Examples include: Application whitelisting; malware/
intrusion prevention tools; virtualization and sandboxing; one-
time password systems; requiring hardware tokens for
authentication.
• Detect persistence; respond and recover.
Examples include: File reputation services; file integrity
checking; blocking known malicious command and control
channels; reviewing audit and event logs; advanced
behavioral analysis techniques.
5. Example control—
escalate or propagate
The attacker has persistence on the object and
seeks to expand control by escalation of privileges
on the object or propagation to another object.
Examples include: Administrator privileges hijacked
or stolen; administrator’s password used by
unauthorized party; secure configuration is changed
and/or audit function is disabled; authorized users
access resources they do not need to perform job;
process or program that runs as root is
compromised or hijacked.
• Limit escalation of privileges or access propagation to other
assets.
Examples include: Restricting privileges for accounts,
programs, and processes; implementing and following
configuration change control processes; using hardware
tokens or two-factor authentication for privileged actions.
• Detect escalation or propagation activity; respond and
recover.
Examples include: Use of intrusion detection system (IDS)
tools; reviewing audit and event logs.
6. Achieve attack
objective
The attacker achieves an objective. Loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or
system capability.
Examples include: Exfiltration of files; modification
of database entries; deletion of file or application;
denial of service; disclosure of PII.
• Minimize impact from successful attack.
Examples include: Use of data loss prevention tools; laptop
and media encryption; outbound boundary filtering;
educating users to protect critical information; restricting
access to critical information and resources; file and
transaction (e.g., email) encryption; link encryption/VPNs.
• Detect impact from successful attack; respond and recover.
Example methods include: Use of auditing and insider
threat tools; network event and analysis tools.

the steps of a compromise can be articulated from the viewpoint of the malicious
attacker to assist in determining what defender actions should be taken to counter the
attack actions.
PENETRATION TESTING
Beyond vulnerability assessments, there may be a requirement to attempt to
exploit vulnerabilities to mimic real-world attacks. Penetration testing19 is another
type of security testing that requires the penetration tester to “simulate the actions
of a given class of attacker by using a defined set of documentation (i.e., the
documentation representative of what that class of attacker is likely to possess)
and working under other specific constraints to attempt to circumvent the security
features of an information system” [1]. In addition, penetration testing can assist
in prioritizing20 vulnerabilities in hosts or devices based on the potential for being
compromised. Further, the penetration testing can also be used to test the controls
in-place to resist or detect potential attacks.
TIP
During the attack phase of penetration testing, vulnerabilities identified in the discovery phase
tested to determine if they can be exploited. Although not a complete list, vulnerabilities can
generally fall into one of the following types of categories [3]:
•
Misconfigurations. Misconfigured security settings, particularly insecure default settings,
are usually easily exploitable.
•
Kernel flaws. Kernel code is the core of an open source (OS), and enforces the overall
security model for the system—so any security flaw in the kernel puts the entire system in
danger.
•
Buffer overflows. A buffer overflow occurs when programs do not adequately check input for
appropriate length. When this occurs, arbitrary code can be introduced into the system and
executed with the privileges—often at the administrative level—of the running program.
•
Insufficient input validation. Many applications fail to fully validate the input they receive
from users.
•
Symbolic links. A symbolic link (symlink) is a file that points to another file. Operating
systems include programs that can change the permissions granted to a file.

strategies for eliminating the identified vulnerabilities and mitigating associated risks.”
387
Penetration Testing

TIP (CONTINUED)
•
File descriptor attacks. File descriptors are numbers used by the system to keep track of files
in lieu of filenames. Specific types of file descriptors have implied uses. When a privileged
program assigns an inappropriate file descriptor, it exposes that file to compromise.
•
Race conditions. Race conditions can occur during the time a program or process has entered
into a privileged mode. A user can time an attack to take advantage of elevated privileges
while the program or process is still in the privileged mode.
•
Incorrect file and directory permissions. File and directory permissions control the access
assigned to users and processes. Poor permissions could allow many types of attacks, including
the reading or writing of password files or additions to the list of trusted remote hosts.
NOTE
NIST Special Publication 800-53 has established a requirement for high security categorized
information systems to include penetration testing as part of the security practices. In this section,
the vulnerability scanning requirements are presented for information systems categorized as high
in accordance with FIPS 199.

testing: planning; discovery; attack; reporting. During the planning phase, the
rules of engagement (ROE22) is developed, which includes the goals and rules
of the penetration testing. The discovery phase includes information gathering
(e.g., port/service identification, hostname/IP address information, employee
name/contact information, and application information) and scanning (e.g., vul-
nerability assessment23). After the discovery phase, the attack phase, similar to
the attack steps in Table 10.1, focus on exploiting24 vulnerabilities. Although not
all exploits will allow the tester to gain escalated privileges, the attack phase
could include expanding the knowledge of the network and other vulnerabilities
that could potentially allow the tester to gain additional accesses, change system
state to achieve escalated privileges, or install additional tools.

Penetration Testing

TIP
Rules of engagement template [3]:
1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose
Identifies the purpose of the document as well as the organization being tested, the
group conducting the testing (or, if an external entity, the organization engaged to
conduct the testing), and the purpose of the security test.
1.2. Scope
Identifies test boundaries in terms of actions and expected outcomes.
1.3. Assumptions and limitations
Identifies any assumptions made by the organization and the test team. These may
relate to any aspect of the test to include the test team, installation of appropriate
safeguards for test systems, and so on.
1.4. Risks
Inherent risks exist when conducting information security tests—particularly in the
case of intrusive tests. This section should identify these risks, as well as mitigation
techniques and actions to be employed by the test team to reduce them.
1.5. Document structure
Outlines the ROE’s structure, and describes the content of each section.
2. Logistics
2.1. Personnel
Identifies by name all personnel assigned to the security testing task, as well as key
personnel from the organization being tested. This section should include a table with all
points of contact (POC) for the test team, appropriate management personnel, and the
incident response team. If applicable, security clearances or comparable background
check details should also be provided.
2.2. Test schedule
Details the schedule of testing, and includes information such as critical tests and
milestones. This section should also address hours during which the testing will take
place—for example, it may be prudent to conduct technical testing of an operational site
during evening hours rather than during peak business periods.
2.3. Test site
Identifies the location or locations from which testing is authorized. If testing will
occur on the organization’s site, building and equipment access should be discussed.
Physical access should cover requirements such as badges, escorts, and security personnel
that the testers may encounter. Equipment access should address areas such as level of
access (user or administrator) to the systems and/or network, and physical access to
computer rooms or specific racks that these rooms contain. Areas to which the test team
will not be given access should be identified here as well. If testing will be conducted
from a remote location such as a rented server farm or test lab, details of the test site
architecture should be included in this section.
2.4. Test equipment
Identifies equipment that the test team will use to conduct the information security
tests. This section should also identify the method of differentiating between the
organization’s systems and the systems conducting the testing—for example, if the test
team’s systems are identified by MAC, keeping track of test systems could be handled
through use of network discovery software. In addition to hardware, tools authorized for
use on the network should be identified. It would also be appropriate to include a write-up
of each tool in an appendix.

TIP (CONTINUED)
3. Communication strategy
3.1. General communication
Discusses frequency and methods of communication. For example, identify meeting
schedule, locations, and conference call information if appropriate.
3.2. Incident handling and response
This section is critical in the event that an incident occurs on the network
while testing is in progress. Criteria for halting the information security testing
should be provided, as should details on the test team’s course of action in the
event that a test procedure negatively impacts the network or an adversary
attacks the organization while testing is underway. The organization’s incident
response call tree/chain of command should be provided in a quick-reference
format. A process for reinstating the test team and resuming testing should also
be provided.
4. Target system/network
Identifies the systems and/or networks to be tested throughout the information security
testing process. Information should include authorized and unauthorized IP addresses or
other distinguishing identifiers, if appropriate, for the systems (servers, workstations,
firewalls, routers, etc.), operating systems, and any applications to be tested. It is also
crucial to identify any system not authorized for testing—this is referred to as the
“exclude list.”
5. Testing execution
This section is specific to test type and scope, but should detail allowable and
unallowable activities and include a description of the information security testing
methodology. If necessary, an assessment plan should be developed that complements the
ROE—this could be either an appendix or a separate document.
5.1. Nontechnical test components
Identifies nontechnical test activities that will take place, and includes information
to help identify the types of policies, procedures, and other documents that should be
reviewed. If interviews or site surveys are to be conducted, guidelines should be
established for advance approval of the interview list and questions. If physical security
of information systems is in the scope of the testing, procedures should be determined
and a form—with appropriate signatures and contact information—generated for the
test team to show to law enforcement or onsite security personnel in the event that they
are questioned.
5.2. Technical test components
Includes the type of technical testing to be conducted (e.g., network scanning,
discovery, penetration testing); discusses whether files are authorized to be installed,
created, modified, and/or executed to facilitate testing; and explains the required
actions for those files once testing is completed. Any additional information regarding
the technical testing of the organization’s systems and networks should also be
included in this section. Significant detail should be included on what activities will
occur on the target network to ensure that all parties are aware of what is authorized
and to be expected as a result of the testing.
5.3. Data handling
Identifies guidelines for gathering, storing, transmitting, and destroying test data, and
establishes detailed, unambiguous requirements for data handling. Keep in mind that data
results from any type of information security test will identify vulnerabilities that an
adversary can exploit, and should be considered sensitive.

6. Reporting
Details reporting requirements and the report deliverables expected to be provided throughout
the testing process and at its conclusion. Minimum information to be provided in each report (e.g.,
vulnerabilities and recommended mitigation techniques) and the frequency with which the reports
will be delivered (e.g., daily status reports) should be included. A template may be provided as an
appendix to the ROE to demonstrate report format and content.
7. Signature page
Designed to identify accountable parties and ensure that they know and understand their
responsibilities throughout the testing process. At a minimum, the test team leader and the
organization’s senior management (Chief Security Officer (CSO), Chief Information Security
Officer (CISO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), etc.) should sign the ROE stating that they
understand the test’s scope and boundaries.
FEDRAMP VULNERABILITY SCAN AND PENETRATION
TESTING REQUIREMENTS
The Federal Risk and Authorization Program (FedRAMP) requirements were discussed
in detail in Chapter 8, FedRAMP Primer and Chapter 9, The FedRAMP Cloud
Computing Security Requirements. In this section, the focus will be on the specific
FedRAMP requirements for vulnerability scanning25 and penetration testing.26 As part
of the security testing, FedRAMP requires monthly automated scanning of the operat-
ing systems/infrastructure, web applications, and databases. In addition, annual auto-
mated scanning of the operating systems/infrastructure, web applications, and databases
and penetration testing must be performed by an accredited independent assessor.27
TIP
Cloud Services Provider (CSPs) should ensure that Third-Party Assessment Organizations
(3PAOs) use the same type of vulnerabilities scanning tools to conduct the vulnerability
assessment to ensure that the CSP can obtain the same results during mitigation and continuous
monitoring. This becomes especially critical when closing out findings.
FedRAMP requires the Cloud Services Provider (CSP), for a Joint Authorization

scans be performed by a 3PAO. After the initial vulnerability scanning, the CSP is
required to continue monthly using the same tools used by the 3PAO until all vul-
nerabilities have been eliminated or mitigated. The requirements for vulnerability
scanning include [4]:
•
Authentication/Credential scan—Vulnerability scans must be performed
using system credentials that allow full access to the systems.
•
Enable all nondestructive plug-ins—To ensure that all vulnerabilities are
discovered, the scanner must be configured to scan for all nondestructive findings.
•
Full system boundary scanning—Each scan must include all components
within the system boundary.
•
Scanner signatures up-to-date—The vulnerability scanner used must be up-
to-date and includes the latest revisions of the vulnerability signatures.
•
Provide summary of scanning—Each scan submission must be accompanied
by a summary28 of the scanning performed.
•
POA&M all findings—Findings within the scans must all be addressed in the
Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) or other risk acceptance request
and maintained until the vulnerabilities have been remediated and validated.
TIP
Vulnerability scanning submission requirements [4]:
•
Vulnerability scan data
•
Raw scan files (Format: XML, CSV, or other structure data format)
•
Exported summary reports (Format: PDF, Microsoft Word, or other standard readable documents)
•
Summary reports should include: Executive Summary, Detailed Summary, and
Inventory Report.
•
Current inventory (Format: Excel, CSV, or XML)
•
Identifies all components within the authorization boundary and
•
Vulnerability scans and inventory should patch (e.g., IP address, hostnames, or other
unique identifier).
Similar to vulnerability scanning, FedRAMP also requires annual penetration
testing29 by an independent penetration agent or team (i.e., 3PAO) as part of the
28From FedRAMP PMO. FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance Version 1.0.1. Washington, DC:
US General Services Administration; 2015. “The summary must include a listing of all the scan
files submitted, which scanning tools were used, and a short summary of the purpose of the scan
(e.g., monthly scans, re-scans, verification scans, etc.). In addition, the summary should discuss the
configuration settings of the scanner, including if the signatures were limited for targeted, verifica-
tions scans or if the scope of the scan excluded certain components or IP addresses.”
29From FedRAMP PMO. FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance Version 1.0.1. Washington, DC:
US General Services Administration; 2015. “A penetration test is a proactive and authorized
exercise to break through the security of an IT system. The main objective of a penetration test is
to identify exploitable security weaknesses in an information system. These vulnerabilities may
include service and application flaws, improper configurations, and risk end-user behavior. A pene-
tration test also may evaluation an organization’s security policy compliance, its employees’ secu-
rity awareness, and the organization’s ability to identify and response to security incidents.”

initial and annual security assessment. FedRAMP also requires the CSP
classify the cloud service as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a
Service (PaaS), and/or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and the scope include
all components, and associated services and access path—both internal30 and
external31. The identification of the methods and techniques that will be used to
test the exploitation of devices and/or services will need to be documented
in the ROE. In addition, all of the attack vectors32 (discussed later in this
section) must be included as part of the penetration test, and documented in the
Penetration Test Plan.
The ROE33 is developed by the 3PAO in accordance with NIST SP 800-115,
Appendix B34 and approved by the CSP Authorizing Official prior to testing.
The ROE includes the following information [5]:
•
Local computer incident response team or capability and their requirements
for exercising the penetration test;
•
Physical penetration constraints;
•
Acceptable pre-text for social engineering; and
•
Summary and reference to any third-party agreements, including POC for
third parties that may be affected by the penetration test.

CHAPTER 10 Security testing: vulnerability and penetration testing

NOTE
FedRAMP ROE/Test Plan (TP) requirements [5]
The 3PAO is required to develop the ROE and TP based on the parameters and system
information provided by the CSP, and includes the following information:
•
System scope
Provide a description of the boundaries and scope of the cloud service system, along
with any identified supporting services or systems. System scope should account for
all IP addresses, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), devices, components, software,
and hardware.
•
Assumptions and limitations
Provide a description of the assumptions, dependencies, and limitations that may have an
impact on penetration activities or results. Include references to local and federal legal
constraints that may be relevant to testing or results. Assumptions also include any assumed
agreement, or access to third-party software, systems, or facilities.
•
Testing schedule
Provide a schedule that describes testing phases, initiation/completion dates, and allows
for tracking of penetration testing deliverables.
•
Testing methodology
The methodology section will address relevant penetration testing activities.
•
Relevant personnel
Provide a list of key personnel involved in the management and execution of the
penetration test. This list should include, at a minimum:
•
System Owner (CSP)
•
Trusted Agent (CSP)
•
Penetration Test Team Lead (3PAO)
•
Penetration Test Team Member(s) (3PAO)
•
Escalation Points of Contact (CSP or 3PAO)
•
Incident response procedures
Provide a description of the chain of communication and procedures to be followed,
should an event requiring incident response intervention be initiated during penetration
testing.
•
Evidence handling procedures
Provide a description of procedures for transmission and storage of penetration test
evidence collected during the course of the assessment.
FedRAMP requires not only logical penetration testing to exploit vulnerabil-
ities in the cloud service, but also physical testing to verify locked doors,
alarm systems, and guards providing the physical protection of the information
technology (IT) environment. In addition, the security policies and procedures
are tested to ensure that CSP personnel are notified in the event of a physical
security incident. Security incidents, both physical and logical, should be tested
for different types of attackers [5]:
•
Internal—employees or users who are employed by the CSP, including both
privileged and nonprivileged users;
•
External—users and nonusers of the cloud service who are not employed by
the CSP;
395
FedRAMP Vulnerability Scan and Penetration Testing Requirements

•
Trusted—users35 with approved access right to the cloud service; and
•
Untrusted—nonusers36 of the cloud service.
The attack avenues (or vectors) seek to identify paths at which the cloud
service can be compromised by the different types of attackers, leading to the
unauthorized disclosure of information (loss of confidentiality); unauthorized
modification or destruction of information (loss of integrity); and disruption of
access to or use of information or an information system (loss of availability).
Table 10.2 outlines the different attack vectors identified and developed by
FedRAMP for use by 3PAOs.

In this chapter, security testing assessment methods were introduced, and the dif-
ferentiation between automated and manual techniques. In addition, a review of
two types of security testing, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing were
provided, including the ROE for documenting the purpose of the security test,
and detailed guidelines and constraints regarding the execution of security testing.
Finally, the FedRAMP security testing requirements were discussed with the
focus on vulnerability and penetration testing activities.

enables federal agencies to benefit from the application of a security risk model
that allows them to leverage the authorization through a unified, consistent
security assessment framework.

The goal of a security assessment is to establish confidence that the security
controls employed within the information system (or those inherited) have been
effectively implemented and are operating as intended. Security assessments
conducted at different stages throughout the SDLC5 can benefit organizations
by reducing costs through the reuse of evidence produced through the design,
implementation, and testing of the required security controls. By identifying the
gaps in security requirements early in the SDLC process,6 some security controls
can be more cost-effectively designed and implemented within the information
security architecture,7 and tested8 prior to being fully integrated into the
production operating environment.
The authorization step relies on the quality of the evidence and the results
of the security assessment documented in the security assessment report
(SAR).9 The SAR is one of the three key documents presented to the

control assessments carried out during system development and implementation can also be used

information to authorizing officials.”

authorizing official (AO)10 when making a credible, risk-based decision.11 The
AO uses the information from the security assessment results12 as a factor for
assuming responsibility13 for the information systems operation and the
information that will be processed, stored, or transmitted within the information
system. Through an analysis of the risk associated with the weaknesses and
deficiencies identified during the security assessment, the AO can use the
judgment of the assessor to make a determination if they are deemed to
be acceptable. This reliance on the quality and reliability of the results of the
security assessment places a significant importance on the selection of the inde-
pendent security assessment provider (or security assessor).14 The security
assessment provider must be qualified and competent in conducting security
assessments and capable of assessing the security controls, including compiling
the evidence needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the security controls
employed within the information system. In addition, the security assessor must
be able to effectively present the evidence in a manner that enables a
risk-based decision to be made.

steps will be discussed, with the focus on assisting organizations in developing

FedRAMP assessment process and a 3PAO for making a risk-based decision.

Introduction to the Security Assessment Process

their organization-wide strategy15 by presenting a framework for managing
security assessments. The framework includes three key areas:
•
Governance.
•
Preparation.
•
Execution.
NOTE
The FedRAMP provides a structured, policy-driven process for building a trusted relationship
between Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and federal agency customers. In addition, it supports
the acceleration, and secure adoption and use of commercial and noncommercial cloud services
through a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security authorization by integrating security
assessment as a part of the SDLC. FedRAMP also enables federal agencies to benefit from the
application of a security risk model that allows them to leverage the authorization through a
unified, consistent security assessment framework.
GOVERNANCE IN THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT
The security assessment policy establishes the governance for the security
assessment process. The policy, at a minimum, should cover the requirements
for the security assessment preparation and execution, the methodology
by which the security assessment is directed and guided, and the roles
and
responsibilities.
The
security
assessment
methodology
establishes
a
repeatable framework for conducting security assessments through the consis-
tent and structured application of assessment procedures, processes, methods,
and practices [1]. The methodology16 also addresses the approach the organiza-
tion will use for determining the reuse of security assessment results and how
the security assessment will be conducted.
15From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53A
Revision 4, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and
Organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2014. “Organizations
are encouraged to develop a broad-based, organization-wide strategy for conducting security and
privacy assessments, facilitating more cost-effective and consistent assessments across the
inventory of information systems.”

CHAPTER 11 Security assessment and authorization

There are generally two primary roles in security assessments, the security
assessment customer and the security assessment provider.17 Security assessment
customers and providers can be from the same organization or the provider can be
contracted from a public or private entity outside of the customer organization.
However, to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of security assessments, a degree
of independence is critical, specifically for reusing previous assessment results.18 For
example, security assessment-related documentation and evidence could be produced
from testing conducted as an integrated part of the SDLC19 or from third-party testing
20 “if an information system component product is identified as providing support for
the implementation of a particular security control” [2].
Security assessments can also include assessment results from other security
assessments performed from outside of the organization. In these situations, factors
relating to the security assessment results for security controls outside of the bound-
ary for the information system being assessed must consider the credibility
of the results being inherited,21partially or completely, at the organization level
17From Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working Group. NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to
Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. Maryland: National Institute of
Standards and Technology; 2010. “The security assessment provider can be an individual, group,
or organization responsible for conducting a comprehensive assessment of the management, opera-
tional, and technical security controls employed within or inherited by an information system to
determine the overall effectiveness of the controls (i.e. the extent to which the controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting the security requirements for the system).”

Organizations. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and Technology; 2014. “Security control
assessments and privacy control assessments include common controls that are the responsibility of
organizational entities other than the information system owner inheriting the controls or hybrid
controls where there is shared responsibility among the system owner and designated organiza-
tional entities.”
405
Governance in the Security Assessment

(i.e., information security program) rather than the information at system level to
preserve impartiality. From an organizational perspective, security assessments,
where there is a shared responsibility22 conducted by different parts of the same
organization, require an appropriate level of independence to ensure the segregation
of responsibilities and accountability for maintaining security assessment results.
NOTE
In the FedRAMP Policy Memo, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined four key
stakeholders:
•
Joint Authorization Board (JAB)—US Department of Defense (DoD), US General Services
Administration (GSA), and US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
•
FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO).
•
DHS.
•
Federal Agencies.
The FedRAMP PMO described the role of these four stakeholders in the frequently asked
question (FAQ) [3]. “Who are the key FedRAMP organizations?” In addition, several other roles
described in the FAQ were identified as having a direct and indirect responsibility within
FedRAMP. The other roles include:
•
NIST.
•
Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council.
•
Third Party Assessor Organizations (3PAO).
•
CSPs.
The JAB approves the accreditation criteria for 3PAOs to provide independent assessments of
CSPs’ implementation of the FedRAMP security authorization requirements [4]. NIST, which has
been given responsibilities under Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA),23 is
tasked with developing the standards and guidelines used within FedRAMP. NIST also plays a
supplementary support function indirectly supporting FedRAMP through the establishment of training
frameworks24 and education programs.25 The FedRAMP PMO coordinates and collaborates with the
NIST to develop and implement a formal conformity assessment program26 to accredit 3PAOs to
provide independent assessments of how CSPs implement the FedRAMP requirements [5].

program designed to “provide people new to risk management with an overview of a methodology
for managing organizational risk—the Risk Management Framework (RMF).”

CHAPTER 11 Security assessment and authorization

NOTE
Why is FedRAMP accrediting 3PAOs? [6]
Although there currently is no standard or guidance for choosing a 3PAO, the FedRAMP
PMO and NIST have designed a conformity assessment process to ensure the independence of
and the management and technical quality of 3PAOs using a standard and consistent security
assessment process.
How does a company become a 3PAO? [3]
The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) accredits FedRAMP 3PAOs
with the FedRAMP PMO providing final approval. Please contact A2LA for more information on
becoming an accredited FedRAMP 3PAO.
When is a 3PAO required? [6]
CSPs that go through FedRAMP must use a 3PAO to provide an independent verification and
validation of the security implementations required by FedRAMP. FedRAMP provisional
authorizations must include an assessment by a FedRAMP-accredited 3PAO to ensure a consistent
assessment process.
Is the use of FedRAMP approved 3PAO require for assessment? [3]
A FedRAMP approved 3PAO is required for FedRAMP JAB P-ATO (Provisional
Authorization to Operate) and CSP supplied packages, but is optional for FedRAMP Agency
Authorization packages.
PREPARING FOR THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT
Security assessments can be a challenging, time-consuming, and costly activity
if the security assessment customer does not appropriately plan and prepare for
the security assessment activities. Even before selecting the security assessment
provider, the security assessment customer needs to understand its objectives
and the information needed to support decisions regarding the impact associated
with using an information system. In addition, security assessments can become
even more complex, specifically in multilevel or multiservice provider relation-
ships, where security assessment activities may be distributed between more
than one service provider. Therefore, more focus is required to be placed on the
coordination activities, to ensure sufficient information is made available to
the security assessor. This situation may also require either working through
requests from the other service providers to participate in a security assessment
of all of the security controls or to obtain the security assessment results27
to be included within the current security assessment to inform the security
assessment customer.
27Depending on the length of time between the last assessment and the current assessment,
inheritance of assessment results could require additional time to ensure that the assessment results
are still valid by validating the completeness, accuracy, and reliability.
407
Preparing for the security assessment

From the initiation of the security assessment,28 both parties’ involvement is
essential to ensure the preparatory (pre-assessment) activities conclude with
an executable plan for the assessment. As illustrated in Fig. 11.1, the security
assessment process requires the participation from both the assessment customer

CHAPTER 11 Security assessment and authorization

and the security assessment provider. During the security assessment,29 the
security assessment team will rely heavily on the participation and knowledge of
the security assessment customer to ensure that there is an impartial and objective
report of the security control effectiveness, and also a quality assessment, which
provides key information needed for decision-makers. This information includes
details about the deficiencies and weaknesses that, if compromised (i.e., security
controls designed to assure the level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability),
could impact mission and business functions supported through the use of the
information system. After the security assessment (post-assessment), the SAR is
generated to build an assurance case.30 The SAR provides a summary of the
security-related
information
needed
for
establishing
a
credible,
risk-based
decision.
SECURITY ASSESSMENT CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES
The customer of the security assessment plays an essential role in the proper
planning of the security assessment activities. The security assessment customer
is responsible for implementing the security controls, but also has the responsi-
bility of appropriately selecting a qualified security assessment provider, and in
determining the objective and scope of the security assessment. In parallel with
the preparation activities, the security assessment customer should, at minimum,
conduct its own security readiness review.31 The security readiness review
ensures that the appropriate security-related information has been organized in a
manner that can be easily evaluated by the security assessor. The security asses-
sor uses the security-related information to gain an understanding of the organi-
zation’s mission and business functions, how those functions are supported by
the information system, and how the security controls have been implemented
to meet the minimum assurance requirements. The information provided by the
security assessment customer should also include a description of any security

assessment provider has the necessary technical expertise (i.e., knowledge,33
skills,34 and abilities35). The independence36 is critical when multiple organi-
zations are responsible for the security control implementations. Therefore,
the security assessment customer should determine the most appropriate
approach to ensure that there is a necessary separation37 between the security
assessment provider and those involved in the development, operations, and
management of the information system. This is specifically important when

verifying that they are accurate and complete to ensure they are still valid as

•
Uses a methodology that is aligned with the NIST standards and processes for ensuring that
cloud services meet the federal government’s minimum security requirements.
•
Applies a consistent and standardized process for conducting security assessments.
Security Assessment Planning
The security assessment customer also plays a central role in ensuring that
the security assessment is conducted effectively and efficiently. In its role, the
security assessment customer must ensure that it is not only ready for
the security assessment by performing its own readiness review, but it also
needs to provide the necessary information (e.g., evidence of prior assess-
ments and artifacts describing security control implementation) and make the
resources (e.g., information system access and knowledgeable personnel)
available to support the security assessment. The security-relevant information
helps security assessors understand the scope of the information system and
the security controls being assessed. The more complete and accurate the
information, the more tailored the security assessor can make the SAP and
supporting assessment procedures. Therefore, prior to the security assessment,
the security assessment customer should identify the scope of the assessment
and the system components that will be the target of the security assessment.
For example, scoping the security assessment could include identifying the
number and types of components (i.e., a homogeneous environment that has
been consistently configured generally may require less depth or coverage)
and determining resource requirements (i.e., accessibility/complexity of the
operating environment and use of automated tools versus manual evaluation
or inspections techniques).
After the scoping has been completed, the security assessment customer
should focus on gathering the security-relevant information for the security
assessment provider to evaluate so that a realistic schedule can be developed for
conducting the security assessment. Security-relevant information gathered and

•
Inventories and hardware/software specifications.
TIP
The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) CloudAudit43 is an example of the type of framework that
could be used by security assessment customers and leveraged to automate the collection of
information (i.e., assertions and artifacts) needed to support a security assessment. “The goal of
CloudAudit was to provide a common interface and namespace that allows enterprises who are
interested in streamlining their audit processes (cloud or otherwise) as well as cloud computing
providers to automate the Audit, Assertion, Assessment, and Assurance of their infrastructure
(IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) environments and allow authorized consumers of
their services to do likewise via an open, extensible and secure interface and methodology.” [8]
During the security assessment, the security assessor may require assistance
from security assessment customer personnel who may have knowledge about
how security controls are managed or were integrated into the information system
and the operational environment. The security assessment customer should make
available key personnel who would need to be interviewed or participate (i.e.,
conducting security testing) in the security assessment. Depending on the scope
of the assessment, coordination and collaboration may be required to limit
impacts on the security assessment customer’s ongoing operations or existing
customers that rely on the services provided by the target information system.
Therefore, participation by the security assessment customer is essential to ensure

SECURITY ASSESSMENT PROVIDER RESPONSIBILITIES
The security assessment provider should have a management structure that can
deliver a quality security assessment and the technical capabilities to effectively
execute the given security assessment. The results of the security assessment
execution should provide key decision-makers within the security assessment
customer organization (or organizational official(s) that are responsible for mak-
ing the authorization decision44) with the needed security-related information
(and supporting evidence) to make a credible, risk-based decision. These security
assessment results are compiled by the security assessment provider through
the execution of a variety of methods45 and techniques and supported by the
management structure46 and operational/management systems to ensure the
consistency and reliability of the security assessment process, and the quality,
accuracy, and completeness of the security-related information.

NOTE (CONTINUED)
The A2LA assessment ensures that 3PAOs meet the FedRAMP requirements of ISO 17020
(as revised) and FedRAMP specific knowledge requirements related to the FedRAMP Security
Assessment Framework. The A2LA provides an assessment report to FedRAMP that documents
the 3PAO:
•
Is competent to perform inspections of CSP documents
•
Has a documented and fully operational quality system
•
Quality system meets the standards of ISO/IEC 17020-2012
•
Is operating in accordance with its quality system A2LA also assesses 3PAOs with specific
FedRAMP and FISMA knowledge.
A 3PAO must demonstrate technical competence through reviews of System Security Plans,
creation of an SAP, and documenting the results in Security Assessment Test Cases as well as a
Security Assessment Report. [9]
FedRAMP 3PAOs must maintain a management system and technical competence and
capability to ensure assessment of cloud services are performed consistently and in compliance
with the FedRAMP requirements. The FedRAMP management and technical requirements are
summarized as follows:
Management Requirements [10]:
•
Conducting inspections and maintain a quality management system in accordance with ISO/
IEC 17020.
•
Ensuring that the security assessment team members are competent in performing security
assessments.
•
Ensuring the protection of proprietary information received as part of the assessment.
Technical Requirements [10]:
•
Maintaining knowledge, understanding, and competency in the application of the FedRAMP
program security assessment standards, guidelines, and requirements and cloud-based
information system-related technologies and practices.
•
Maintaining knowledge and understanding in the use of NIST publications and programs.
•
Selecting personnel that collectively have the relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities for
conducting a security assessment on a given cloud-based information system.
•
Preparing an SAP consistent with the FedRAMP requirement, including reviewing the SAP
with the cloud service provider.
•
Conducting a security assessment with the SAP and preparing a SAR consistent with the
FedRAMP requirements.
The requirements established by the FedRAMP PMO ensure that the resulting security
assessment results and supporting evidence can be leveraged by multiple federal agencies through
a single FedRAMP security authorization package.

applicable governing federal information security laws, directives, policies,
standards, and guidelines.49
Developing the Security Assessment Plan
The SAP provides the roadmap for executing the security assessment. In the
SAP, the rules50 by which the security assessment provider conducts the
security assessment are documented to ensure the security assessment customer
understands and agrees to the scope of the assessment and also the types of
activities that will be performed. The SAP could also include any applicable
assumptions and legal considerations (i.e., limitations of liability or nondisclo-
sures to protect both the security assessment customer should any significant
issues that occur during or after the assessment). Although the primary responsi-
bility for the development of the SAP is usually the security assessment
provider, it should be developed in collaboration with the security assessment
customer to ensure the following key points are covered:
•
Scope—number of components and locations, the types of assessment (or
objective), and the depth/coverage.
•
Authorizations—networks and systems identified by IP address or range and
hostname.
•
Logistics—resource requirements, availability of the location and
environment, and testing tools.
•
Data handling—storage and physical/logical safeguards for data stored at-rest
and during transmission, and destruction/sanitization of data after the
assessment.
•
Incident response—definition of the incident and actions that should be taken
or guidelines that should be followed by all parties.
The development of the SAP also requires completing several steps to address
the key points are covered either within the SAP directly or referenced externally
in other contractual documents (e.g., authorization memorandum, engagement
or arrangement letter, service agreement, rules of engagement (ROE), service
contracts, etc.).
Identify In-Scope Security Controls
The security assessor in the development of the SAP must first consider the
type of assessment, complete or partial, and the security controls described in
the system security plan (SSP), in-place or planned, for meeting the security
49As an example, the (ISC)2 Certified Authorization Professional (CAP) certification can assist in

assessment customer’s security requirements. A complete assessment is usually
performed during the initial authorization or where significant changes have
occurred and the scope of the changes cannot be isolated to a specific set of
controls and therefore all security controls will be in-scope for the security
assessment. A partial assessment only focuses on a subset of security controls.
The subset of security controls can be those selected as part of the continuous
(or ongoing) monitoring activities, security testing performed as part of the
normal SDLC, which includes assessing a specific set of security controls
implemented within the change control process (assuming the scope of the
change can be bounded), or where previous assessments occurred and were
leveraged, but additional security controls were included to supplement
the security control baseline to address unique organizational security require-
ments. After the purpose of the security assessment has been determined, the
SSP and the continuous monitoring strategy51 are reviewed to select the security
controls that would be considered in-scope for the assessment and be used for
the remainder of the steps in the SAP development.

procedures.52
Assessment
procedures
provide

selected in the SSP, a complementary assessment procedure is selected. For
example, Table 11.1 provides the assessment procedure for CA-2 (Security
Assessment).
Assessment procedures include one or more objectives for the assessment.
The assessment objectives consist of a series of determination statements,53 which
map to the functionality of the security control and assist the security assessor in
demonstrating the extent to which a security control is implemented correctly,
operates as intended, and produces the desired outcome. In addition, within each
assessment objective, methods and objects are used by the security assessment

provider during the security assessment. The assessment methods54 and objects55
together define the specific actions taken and items selected by the security
assessor to produce a finding (or determination of effectiveness) for the security
assessment. In Table 11.1, the assessment method for the CA-2 assessment objec-
tive contains three different types of assessment methods, examine, interview, and
test. The security assessor can use one or all methods to make a determination if
the assessment objective is achieved. For the examination assessment method, the
security assessor can choose from the identified assessment objects (or other
objects not included on the list) to produce the necessary information for the
assessor to make a determination of the assessment objective.
TIP
Assessment procedures can form the basis for developing assessment cases.56 Assessment cases
provide a tool for security assessment customers (e.g., federal agency, CSP, communities of
interest, etc.) by providing a specific set of assessor actions. The assessment cases represent the
specific viewpoint of the community that developed them and present the necessary actions that
should be taken to cost-effectively conduct the security assessment. Similar to the security control
selection process,57 tailoring and supplementation is applied to the baseline assessment cases.
Tailor Assessment Procedures
Assessment tailoring involves customizing the assessment procedure to more
closely reflect the characteristics of the information system and the operating
environment. Customization may be conducted at the organizational level,
information system level, or both. The goal of tailoring assessment procedures is
to produce the most accurate representation of the security assessment actions
necessary to make a determination in the most cost-effective manner. Some
assessment procedures may require more tailoring than others or, depending on
the phase of the SDLC in which the security assessment is being performed,
the assessment procedures may be tailored to focus on a specific aspect of the

information system. For example, security assessments conducted during the
development/acquisition phase can be tailored to focus on testing very specific
functionality to identify deficiencies or weaknesses that may be more costly to
remediate in later phases of the SDLC process.
Tailoring involves applying considerations58 to help guide the selection of
potential activities focused on during the assessment. The security assessment
customer may provide guidance to assist the security assessor in determining the
level of the assessment tailoring that is appropriate for the given assessment.
The level of tailoring could also depend on factors such as the available
timing and scope for the security assessment. In this chapter, we will only focus
on two of the tailoring considerations:
•
Selecting assessment methods and objects.
•
Selecting depth and coverage attributes.
Selecting Assessment Methods and Objects
Security assessors have various options available when selecting assessment
methods and objects. Each assessment procedure provides potential options.
However, assessors are not necessarily limited to those included in the baseline
assessment procedures to obtain the evidence needed to support the determination
of security control effectiveness. The actions performed by the security assessors
and the types of objects selected for the assessment can be obtained by reviewing
the information provided by the security assessment customer as part of the
preparatory activities. For example, the SSP and supporting artifacts provided to
the security assessors could provide valuable insight into how a particular security
control was implemented and what types of methods (e.g., examine, interview,
and test) and objects (e.g., specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals)
would be required for producing evidence and a determination of security control
effectiveness.
Selecting Depth and Coverage Attributes
Security assessors also have options for defining the depth and coverage of
assessment procedures. The depth and coverage attributes59 represent the rigor
and scope of the assessment and impact the level of effort required for con-
ducting the security assessment. The more detailed the assessment activities,

for tailoring assessment procedures that could include: (1) selecting assessment method and object,

security objectives. Although not specifically identifiable60 in assessment
procedures like the methods and objects, the depth and coverage become
important factors when building the assurance case during the security
assessment execution.
Supplementing Assessment Procedures
The security assessment provider may need to supplement the assessment
procedures where security controls unique to an organization or information
system do not exist in the baseline security controls (or the assessment procedures
do not exist). This could occur where the organization has supplemented the
baseline security controls to adequately mitigate organizational-specific risks. In
this situation, the additional security controls documented in the SSP would
require the security assessor in collaboration with the security assessment
customer to develop new assessment procedures.
Optimize Assessment Procedures
Optimizing security assessments involves the consolidation or sequencing of
assessment procedures to reduce the cost of an associated security assessment. In
this activity, the security assessor organizes the assessment procedures in the
most efficient way that would enable executing assessment methods and selecting
the assessment objects in a manner most likely to produce the desired evidence.
For example, some assessment procedures may focus on different aspects of the
same control, or different security controls may be integrated into the same
components or be related. Therefore, sequencing assessment procedures may
facilitate efficiency and reuse of security assessment results.
Finalize and Approve Assessment Plan
Once the SAP has been completed and the assessment procedures have been
selected, tailored, and optimized, the security assessment provider must obtain
approval from the security assessment customer. This approval acknowledges
acceptance and gives the security assessor permission to begin executing the SAP
in accordance with the schedule and milestones.
EXECUTING THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT PLAN
The formal approval of the SAP gives the security assessment provider the
authorization to begin conducting the security assessment. The SAP utilizes a

the depth and coverage. In addition, examples of how depth and coverage are applied are shown in

Revision 4, Appendix H.

variety of methods, techniques, and tools during the course of executing the
assessment procedures. The assessment procedures provide the necessary informa-
tion for determining the depth and scope, and will enable the security assessor to
select the appropriate testing methodology for the particular type of security
assessment. For example, where the security assessment requires conducting pen-
etration testing,61 the security assessor usually focuses on a scoped and controlled
set of components that attempt to identify an attacker (or class of attackers).
Since the attackers must operate under constraints, the characterization of the
attacker and the tools and techniques62 will be very specialized to the assessment
procedure being executed.
TIP
The FedRAMP Security Controls Baseline for Moderate-Impact cloud services requires the CSP
in CA-7 (Continuous Monitoring) to plan, schedule, and conduct assessments annually that
include unannounced penetration testing and in-depth monitoring to ensure compliance with all
vulnerability mitigation plans [11]. In addition, in RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning), the CSP is
required to employ an independent penetration agent or penetration team to conduct a
vulnerability analysis, perform penetration testing based on the analysis of the vulnerabilities to
determine their exploitability63 [11].
The assessment procedures for CA and RA will likely evaluate compliance of the CSP by
examining the risk assessment and security assessment policies and procedure, the continuous
monitoring plan, vulnerability scan results, and records of vulnerability mitigations and
penetration to determine if the CSP, given the existing vulnerabilities within the cloud service,
conducted penetration testing (where applicable). The security assessor could conduct formal
interviews with CSP personnel that would have the role and responsibility for coordinating and
supporting penetration testing, and ensuring the testing was conducted in accordance with the
vulnerability mitigation procedures.
During the security assessment, results are produced and documented
through actions associated with each assessment objective where selected
methods and objects were applied. The security assessment results establish a
conclusion about the determination of whether the objectives for the security
control have been achieved. The evidence to support the determination is

collected and a summary is documented by the security assessor that provides
the basis for the finding. Since the findings are meant to be unbiased and
objective, the security assessor must present in detail the rationale for why a
particular assessment objective was documented as either satisfied (S) or other
than satisfied (O).64 The rationale for establishing an “O” finding may be due
to issues other than the security control ineffectiveness. The other issues
could include the inability of the security assessor to make a determination
where information was insufficient or the unavailability of a particular
information system component under examination that was needed for making
the determination.
For the security assessment results produced, the security assessment customer
should review the findings with specific emphasis on those determinations that
result in an “O” finding to determine the significance and to assist in prioritizing
findings when developing corrective actions based on the recommendations
provided by the security assessor. In addition, the review of the findings may also
give an indication that there was a lack of understanding by the security assessor
of how the security controls were implemented in the SSP and the security
assessment customer may need to provide further clarification to ensure that
the most accurate reflection of the effectiveness of the security controls is
documented in the SAR.

INTRODUCTION TO CONTINUOUS MONITORING
Continuous1 monitoring (CM)2 is an organizational-wide activity that supports
risk management by enabling an organization to understand and maintain its
information security and risk posture through the collection, analysis, monitoring,
and reporting of security-related information. To be effective, CM needs to be
driven by the organization’s management to ensure that it is managed as a part of
the enterprise-wide risk management activity. This ensures that monitoring is con-
sidered outside the context of a single information system, but rather as an inte-
grated part of the organization’s risk management function. CM begins by
defining the CM strategy. The CM strategy links to the organizational strategies,
goals, and objectives, and ensures that there is a common understanding of
organizational-wide risk tolerance. The risk tolerance is used when determining
how to develop and execute a CM program that includes tasks3 such as collecting

and reporting on metrics, conducting and reporting security control assessments,
planning, controlling, and maintaining change management and configuration
control, conducting risk assessments and prioritizing risk responses.
NOTE
CM is not necessarily a new requirement for the federal government. Historically, as far back as
1995, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) introduced the concept, as one
of two activities4 used to support operational assurance.5 At that time, monitoring was simply
defined as an “ongoing activity that checks on the system, its users, or the environment” [1]. In
1996, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III,6 a government-
wide policy was established for federal agencies to review security controls on an ongoing basis
through the use of technical tools and techniques.7 The Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA) codified CM, by requiring federal agencies to monitor, test, and evaluate
information security controls. However, it was not until the publication of the first revision of
NIST SP 800-37 that the federal agencies had a systematic model for applying CM within the
context of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The NIST security certification and
accreditation (C&A) process introduced CM in the fourth phase.8
NIST further published CM guidance in NIST SP 800-1379 to address assessment and analysis
of security control effectiveness and of organizational security status in accordance with
organizational risk tolerance. [2] This guidance was established in government-wide policy10 in
the most recent revised version of OMB Circular A-130.11
4The difference between system audits and monitoring focused on the notion of “real time.”

CHAPTER 12 Strategies for continuous monitoring

The broader CM activity within an organization is implemented through the
execution of three major foundational elements:
•
Organizational governance.
•
CM strategy.
•
CM program.
These elements operate together to ensure that CM is conducted as an
organizational-wide activity that includes the participation from both those
responsible for defining the strategy for the organization and those responsible
for the day-to-day management and monitoring of information systems. A com-
mon CM approach across the organization enables each level of the organization
to more effectively communicate and share information that would support a
cost-efficient, resilient, and timely12 risk management strategy. The increasing
reliance on information technology (IT) for supporting the organization’s
mission and as a critical part of its business operations requires accurate and
up-to-date information for making continuous risk-based decisions. Using a
standardized CM approach enables the security- and risk-related information to
be produced both cost-effectively and efficiently through a managed set of
resources and processes.
ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE
The management of risk requires a “top-down” approach, led by management,
with the establishment of the CM strategy. The CM strategy, as illustrated in
Fig. 12.1, is implemented through a comprehensive CM program.
The role of governance13 is to ensure that the CM strategy is consistently
applied through a CM program across the organization. The process for imple-
menting CM, briefly introduced in this section and discussed in detail later in this
chapter, requires an effective integration into the organization’s governance struc-
ture. Governance manages the CM strategy and program through the CM pro-
cesses, which include:
•
Defining a strategy for continuous monitoring;
•
Developing and implementing a CM program;
•
Analyzing data and reporting findings;

In the three-tiered model, tier 1 focuses on strategic CM activities that support

tation of CM activities at tiers 2 and 3. The model also represents the alignment
that must exist between the CM process and the risk management process, as
discussed in Chapter 6, so that the monitoring strategy produces information that

tors and executive management in a corporation, the head of a federal agency) with the express
goal of: (i) providing strategic direction; (ii) ensuring that organizational mission and business
objectives are achieved; (iii) ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately; and (iv) verifying
that the organization’s resources are used responsibly.”

is relevant and useful when making risk-related decisions at each organizational
tier. Tier 1 addresses risk management from a strategic perspective by developing
a governance policy that drives the CM strategy and communicates the
organization’s risk management strategy. In tier 2, CM security-related informa-
tion is dependent on the specific importance of the mission/business processes to
the overall organizational goals and objectives. Therefore, it is critical to have an
understanding of the security impacts to ensure appropriate implementation of
CM activities for information systems that support mission/business processes. In
tier 3, CM activities focus on the information system-level security controls to
ensure they implement the organization security requirements and continue to be
effective over time.
Metrics16 developed at each tier guide the collection of security-related infor-
mation used in making risk-based decisions. Therefore, it is important for organi-
zations to select the most appropriate tools and techniques17 that present
information in a format that will be useful for a specific organizational tier. The
format also enables the data that will be collected,18 correlated, analyzed, and
reported to be effectively communicated to provide stakeholders with the most
accurate indication of the security posture.19 Since metrics are a key part20 of
CM, the organization may need to refine and update21 the metrics so they

“continue to be relevant, meaningful, actionable, and supportive of risk manage-
ment decisions made by organizational officials at all tiers” [2].
In addition, federal agencies have legislative and regulatory drivers for capturing
metrics that enable them to measure22 the performance of security related to their
program goals and objectives. The Government Performance Results Act (GPRA)
Modernization Act23 requires a quarterly performance assessment of all government
programs to assess performance and improvement. The long-term strategic plan-
ning24 described in the GPRA Modernization Act requires federal agencies to
define performance goals25 and objectives, and the performance objectives that
are reported on quarterly. Each performance plan includes “a balanced set of
performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing progress toward
each performance goal” [3]. FISMA26 requires federal agencies to report27
on the status of their information security programs. The annual FISMA
report summarizes the performance of the federal agency’s program to
secure all of your agency’s information and information systems [4].
CM STRATEGY
The CM strategy aligns the CM activities with the organization-wide risk
management strategy.28 Through an understanding of the organization’s strate-
gic goals and objectives, the CM requirements can be developed to address
the monitoring and assessment frequency of security controls, and customize
status reporting to ensure consistency across the organization. This further
supports each of the organizational tier’s information needs required for

Introduction to Continuous Monitoring

making risk-based decisions. For the strategy to be effective and support the
organization’s risk management function, it needs to be comprehensive,
broadly encompassing the technology, processes, procedures, operating envi-
ronment, and people [2].
The organization’s information requirements can be different at each of the
organizational tiers, requiring strategies tailored specifically to a tier. Therefore, to
meet the goal of maintaining consistency across the organization, the implementa-
tion of the organization-wide CM strategy needs to be driven by the leadership to
ensure that the CM strategy evolves as requirements for information change at
each tier. In addition to enabling information reuse across the organization, a con-
sistent understanding of the CM strategy ensures a cost-effective implementation
of the processes, procedures, tools, and techniques to all organizational information
systems, achieving a broad organization-wide situational awareness. The CM strat-
egy can also help the organization use an integrated approach to more efficiently
react, such as by changes in a single information system or in the organization’s
threat environment.
TIP
The CM strategy [2] should:
•
Reflect the organization’s risk tolerance (including helping set priorities and consistent
management of risk);
•
Include metrics that provide meaningful indications of security status at all organizational tiers;
•
Ensure continued effectiveness of all security controls;
•
Address verifying compliance with information security requirements derived from
organizational missions/business functions, federal legislation, directives, regulations, policies,
and standards/guidelines;
•
Be informed by all organizational IT assets and aids to maintain visibility into the security of
the assets;
•
Ensure knowledge and control of changes to organizational systems and environments of
operation; and
•
Maintain awareness of threats and vulnerabilities.
An organization-wide CM strategy provides a comprehensive view of the CM
requirements of all organizational tiers. These requirements may be derived from
multiple sources including the key metrics and the frequency of security controls
monitoring and assessments deemed necessary to provide an indication of the
information security and risk posture. CM strategies can also be developed at a
specific tier29 to address local requirements. However, to enable an organization-

CHAPTER 12 Strategies for continuous monitoring

wide approach to CM, tier-specific strategies will need to be driven from a con-
sistent application of the methodologies and practices used at the higher organiza-
tional tiers (i.e., tier 3 strategies should encompass tier 2 policies, procedures, and
processes). This ensures that any condition that would require the tier-specific
strategy to be updated also triggers additional updates to strategies in the higher
tiers so that security-related information captured at the lower tiers maintains rele-
vance

NOTE
In July 2010, OMB released a policy30 that clarified the roles and responsibilities for
cybersecurity. In this policy, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)31 was identified as
having the responsibility for implementing the operational aspects of the cybersecurity of
civilian federal information systems.32 The scope of responsibility as it relates to CM included
the government-wide and agency-specific monitoring and assessment of areas such as
cybersecurity operations and incident response [5]. In addition, DHS’s role was further clarified
in a Federal Information Security Memorandum33 published in August 2011 in which federal
agencies were required to report34 to DHS on metrics through automated35 or manual data
feeds. For example, starting in 2012, DHS started publishing Annual FISMA Reporting
Metrics.36 Within the annual FISMA reporting metrics, CM was identified as a “key element to
managing an information security program is having accurate information about security
postures, activities and threats” [6]. Finally, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act

policies for federal agencies, overseeing agencies’ compliance with those policies, and assisting

CM PROGRAM
Although more tactically focused, the organization’s CM program facilitates the
implementation of the CM strategy. The scope of the program should be designed
to address the sufficiency in security-related information to support risk-based
decisions. This can be accomplished by defining metrics and frequencies38 of
monitoring and assessment that produce the needed information. The development
of a Continuous Monitoring Plan39 facilitates the implementation of the CM pro-
gram. The Continuous Monitoring Plan also addresses the integration of CM
activities and metrics to support the CM strategy through the identification of
security controls necessary for monitoring to ensure their effectiveness40 over
time.
As previously mentioned, metrics provide a guide for collecting security-
related information. The types of metrics defined for the organization reflect the
security objectives for the organization, mission/business processes, and/or infor-
mation systems. In addition, metrics can also be defined at any organizational
tier. Therefore, the organization will need to ensure that the frequency of monitor-
ing, if not consistent across the organizational tiers, has a linkage between the
security-related information requirements.

CHAPTER 12 Strategies for continuous monitoring

THE CONTINUOUS MONITORING PROCESS
For CM to be an effective tool and operate as a source of information for support-
ing the management of risk, the organization needs to ensure that the require-
ments and activities at each level of the organization are addressed in the CM
strategy. This enables risk management activities to more closely reflect the type
of security-related information collected as part of the CM program and used for
making risk-based decisions. As an example, Fig. 12.3 provides a high-level illus-
tration of the alignment that should exist between the CM strategy and the organi-
zational tiers. In addition, it also depicts the inputs that can be potential sources
for deriving requirements that need to be addressed by the strategy for implement-
ing an organization-wide CM program.
The CM process includes both strategic and programmatic activities. The stra-
tegic activities usually occur at the higher level within the organization where the
overall organizational risk tolerance is defined. However, CM strategies can exist
at individual tiers to address requirements specific to a mission or business pro-
cess supported by the information system or information systems where stake-
holders exist across more than one business unit or federal agency. To ensure that
security-related information collected or resources required to support the tier-
specific requirements are reusable, organizations should make sure that there is
some consistency with higher-level tiers.
DEFINING A CM STRATEGY
The CM strategy reflects the organizational driver for CM within the organiza-
tion. The execution of the CM program is facilitated through requirements and
activities included in the strategy. The requirements and activities are defined in
policies, procedures, and templates that support the CM strategy such as metrics,
review/updates, assessment and status monitoring and reporting, risk assessments,
and configuration management. These policies, procedures, and templates are sup-
ported through processes that addresses the requirements at the most appropriate
level within the organization to ensure that risks can be managed at the organiza-
tional risk tolerance.
Strategies developed at the information system tier align more closely with the
NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).41 CM within the NIST RMF will be
discussed in more detail later in this chapter. For the purpose of this section, it is
important to understand that security-related information produced through tier 3

ensure all controls are assessed during the three-year authorization cycle.”

strategies and programs supports the organizational CM strategy and program at
tiers 1 and 2. Management responsible and accountable for risk-based decisions at
tier 1 or 2 are informed with regard to organizational risk based on information
produced at the lower tiers so that appropriate mitigation strategies can be devel-
oped and implemented. In addition, the tier 3 CM strategy also supports ongoing
authorizations [2].
NOTE
In August 2011, DHS released FISM 11-02, FY 2011 Reporting Instructions for the Federal
Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy Management. DHS was given the
authority to provide direction on government-wide metrics and submit information according to
the defined reporting activities and frequency. The activities [4] included:
•
Data feeds
•
Security question responses
•
Cyberstat accountability sessions/agency interviews.
This government-wide CM strategy was developed through collaboration with the Federal
Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council Information Security and Identity Management
Committee (ISIMC) Continuous Monitoring Working Group (CMWG). The CMWG focused on
the establishment of a government-wide CM and risk-scoring capability and the technology,
people, and processes used to implement the capability to enhance the overall security posture of
the federal government [8].
IMPLEMENTING A CM PROGRAM
The CM strategy is implemented through the CM program.42 The scope of the
program should address the requirements43 defined in the strategy for the
security-related information needed by the organization for making risk-based

decisions. These requirements can be across all tiers, or specific to a tier, but
should include at a minimum [9]:
•
Monitoring metrics.
•
Frequency of monitoring and assessments.
•
Security status reporting.
The metrics defined by the organization can come from any tier across the organi-
zation and encompass different sources of security-related information. In addition,
the information can be collected either through manual procedures and techniques44
or automated tools and technologies.45 The frequency can also vary based on the
source of the requirements used as an input to the CM strategy. As an example, in
February 2012, US DHS published the FISMA metrics46 that were required by fed-
eral agencies to incorporate into their CM program for collection and reporting.
Table 12.1 presents sample metrics related to CM published by DHS.

The US Department of State established the iPost Risk Scoring Program to provide summary and
detailed information on the current status of hosts47 at a particular site.48 In 2010, DHS released
the Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational Awareness, and Risk Scoring (CAESARS)
Reference Architecture Report.49 CAESARS was based in part on iPost.50 DHS indicated that
analyzing security-related information, defining and calculating risk, and assigning scores is a key
part of the CM process [11]. However, it is important to note that some management and
operational controls cannot be effectively scored and some aspect of risk management cannot be
automated. The Federal CIO Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC)
established an initiative that would extend the DHS CAESARS. The goal of the CAESARS

CHAPTER 12 Strategies for continuous monitoring

NOTE (CONTINUED)
Framework Extension (FE)51 was to present a technical reference model to allow organizations to
aggregate collected data from across a diverse set of security tools, analyze that data, perform
scoring, enable user questions, and provide overall situational awareness [12].
Metrics used for measuring the organization’s security posture may also be
determined to be different depending on the organizational tier (see Fig. 12.2)
where they are defined. For example, tier 1 metrics may be defined by the
department/agency CIO and/or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
based on a CM strategy that focuses on providing an organizational-wide view
of the security posture at tiers 2 and 3, and to support security governance
decisions. Whereas tier 3 metrics may be defined by the System Owner and/or
Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) based on information collected
for determining the security posture associated with the security control
effectiveness in a specific information system and to support ongoing authori-
zation decisions.
Defining the frequency of monitoring and assessment activities is essential for
the implementation of an effective CM program. Establishing the frequency
requires understanding the organization’s objectives for monitoring and assess-
ments. For example, the following criteria [2] can assist an organization in deter-
mining the frequency:
•
Security control volatility.
•
System categorization/impact level.
•
Security controls or specific assessment objectives providing critical functions.
•
Security control with identified weaknesses.
•
Organizational risk tolerance.
•
Threat/vulnerability information.
•
Risk assessment results.
•
Output of monitoring strategy reviews.
•
Reporting requirements.
The collection and reporting of security-related information is supported by the
CM architecture. Security automation52 facilitates CM through an increase in the
coverage and efficiency of information collection. To make the information useful
and reusable, consideration should be given to ensure that the data supporting
51The CAESARS FE builds upon the DHS CAESARS to address requirements that would make it
applicable to the US Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and the Civilian
Agencies.
52Security automation is discussed in detail in Chapter 13, Cost-Effective Compliance Using
Security Automation.
441
The Continuous Monitoring Process

the CM strategy and program is interoperable53 across the organization. Since
accountability for the security posture may exist with different roles/functions
within or between different organizations, the data needs to be portable when sup-
porting different metrics or different monitoring and assessment frequencies [2].
Although briefly mentioned in this section, the next chapter discusses security auto-
mation in more detail as it relates to supporting CM requirements.
The implementation of the CM program involves operationalizing the orga-
nizational policies and procedures defined at tiers 2 and 3. The policies and
procedures include identifying the types of reports,54 the recipients of the
reports, the frequency of reporting, and any tools and methodologies. In addi-
tion, processes and capabilities55 at tiers 2 and 3 should be designed to enable
the effective collection, analysis, reporting, and response. The collection of
security-related information can be manual or automated, with emphasis placed
on the assembly of the information to ensure it is in a format that makes it
meaningful to stakeholders and provides the necessary visibility for making
risk-based decisions.
The analysis and reporting of security-related information is conducted at tiers
1 and 2 as an aggregate view of the security status of operational and system-
level security controls from across the organization. Tier 3 analysis and reporting
primarily supports ongoing authorizations and system-level mitigations. The pro-
cesses and capabilities support the analysis and reporting by enabling organiza-
tions to consistently and efficiently measure security, determine the effectiveness
of security controls, and prioritize remediation actions.
A response to findings from CM analysis may require coordination with other
stakeholders across the organization. Responses can occur at each organization
tier (e.g., tier 1 responses focus on those aspects that mitigate risk56 through gov-
ernance and policies and tier 3 responses mitigate risk associated with system-
level security policies, procedures, processes, and security controls). Responses
could also include changes to the CM strategy and program discussed in the next
section.

CHAPTER 12 Strategies for continuous monitoring

REVIEW AND UPDATE CM STRATEGY AND PROGRAM
As previously discussed, the CM strategy and program evolves and must continue
to be applicable to the organization’s mission/objectives and operation/threat
environment. CM is a recursive process in which the monitoring strategy is con-
tinually refined [2]. As changes occur to the strategy, the program may need to be
reviewed and updated to support the organization’s risk tolerance and to ensure
the security-related information continues to be relevant and accurate.
NOTE
Changes to the CM strategy could occur due to the following factors [2]:
•
Mission/business processes
•
Enterprise architecture
•
Organizational risk tolerance
•
Threat/vulnerability information
•
Plan of action and milestones (POA&Ms)
•
Security trends
•
Federal laws or regulations
•
Reporting requirements.
The tier 1 and 2 policies and procedures should address the process for
reviewing and updating the strategy. The process should consider potential
aspects [2] of the strategy that ensure sufficiency of the information to support
the organization risk management decisions57 such as:
•
Measurements
•
Metrics
•
Monitoring frequencies
•
Reporting requirements.

Continuous Monitoring within FedRAMP

Provisional Authorization.61 Although the specific aspects of CM implemented
within FedRAMP are primarily limited to tier 3 CM activities, it is important to
discuss how the organization-wide CM discussed earlier in this chapter supports
the implementation of the FedRAMP CM process. Within the context of
FedRAMP, the goal of CM is to enable visibility into the security posture of
cloud services to support continuous risk management decisions. This visibility is
achieved through reporting from the CSP in three areas: operational visibility,
change control, and incident response.
The FedRAMP PMO, Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), and fed-
eral agency each have organizational CM roles and responsibilities when execut-
ing CM activities within the context of FedRAMP. Table 12.2 outlines the
FedRAMP CM roles and responsibilities.
Each operates as an essential stakeholder that supports the effective integration
of organization-wide CM into the FedRAMP process. For the effective manage-
ment of risk CM needs to be applied consistently across the organizational tiers
through common CM policies, procedures, processes, and templates.
In addition, FedRAMP established a methodology that enables the federal gov-
ernment to leverage security-related information that can be applied over more
than one cloud service, effectively improving government-wide security. However,
it is important to note that the CSP’s role in CM is not a substitute for the federal
government’s responsibility and accountability for the use of cloud services.

acceptable risk posture. This process determines whether the set of deployed secu-
rity controls in an information system remain effective in light of planned and
unplanned changes that occur in the system and its environment over time. [13].
Through the three-tiered approach, illustrated in Fig. 12.4, the FedRAMP
PMO, CSP, and federal agency can ensure that the CM strategy and program can
be used to maintain the cloud service’s authorization to operate. The tasks out-
lined in Fig. 12.5 support the three CM areas within the FedRAMP CM process
by ensuring that system information is kept up-to-date while also facilitating risk-
based decisions on an ongoing basis through the assessment and monitoring of
security controls (common, hybrid, or system-level) using security management
and reporting tools.62 This transforms the security controls assessment and risk
determination process into a dynamic process63 that is supported by timely risk
response actions and a cost-effective, ongoing authorization [2].
The FedRAMP security authorization process64 focuses on integrating infor-
mation security and risk management into the SDLC through the application of
the NIST RMF. After the initial authorization, evidence of security control effec-
tiveness will need to be obtained continuously to support the changes65 within the
cloud service and operating environment. The monitoring steps (Step 6) of the
NIST RMF,66 when aligned with the organization’s CM and risk management
activities, support the determination of risk at the organizational and mission/busi-
ness tiers through system-level information.
The operational visibility provides the transparency required by the FedRAMP
PMO and federal agencies through evidence that demonstrate the effectiveness of
the CSPs CM program.67 As we discussed earlier in this chapter, federal agencies
are required to submit quarterly reporting on government-wide metrics to DHS.
Evidence produced by the CSP should be integrated into existing capabilities within

communicating changes to the cloud service and any potential impacts to the
security and risk posture. Through a security impact analysis,69 changes can
be analyzed (or assessed through the annual assessment activities) to determine if
the existing security controls would impact the federal agencies’ risk tolerance.
Incident response is a critical component of the FedRAMP CM process. A
security incident70 should be anticipated and response planned. The Incident

“If a CSP detects an incident that has the potential to cause an agency service
availability disruption, a compromise of data confidentiality, or a compromise
of federal data integrity, the CSP should proceed with notification to
stakeholders in accordance with its incident response plan. CSP’s should first
notify the agency customer who has the potential to be affected by the
incident. All agencies that receive CSP incident reports should ask the CSP if
they would like assistance from US-CERT. If the CSP opts to request
assistance from US-CERT, the agency should notify US-CERT and provide
US-CERT with information on the CSP point of contact.” [14]
•
Multiple federal agencies affected:
•
“After agency notification is completed, CSPs should notify their
FedRAMP ISSO. FedRAMP ISSOs will engage in a dialogue with CSPs to
obtain all relevant information. The FedRAMP ISSO will make note of
whether or not the CSP requested assistance from US-CERT. The CSP’s
FedRAMP ISSO will confirm that all affected agency POCs are notified of
the incident. After communications with the CSP takes place, the
FedRAMP ISSO will contact US-CERT to confirm that US-CERT has
been made aware of the incident. FedRAMP ISSOs will engage in a
dialogue with US-CERT to obtain all relevant information.” [14]
SUMMARY
In this chapter, CM was discussed from the perspective of the organization sup-
porting the monitoring and assessment activities. CM includes both strategic
and tactical components that enable it to be implemented cost-effectively.
Beginning with a comprehensive and robust CM strategy, the organization can
ensure alignment with the organization’s overall risk management strategy. The
design and implementation of the CM program is supported through the defini-
tion of metrics, frequencies, and formats for assembling and distributing
security-related information. Within the context of FedRAMP, CM can be a
complex activity that requires the appropriate coordination between multiple
stakeholders. The interaction between the CSP, FedRAMP PMO, and federal
agency relies upon the consistent implementation of policies, procedures, pro-
cesses, and templates that support activities that enable operational visibility,
change control, and incident response.
72FedRAMP Program Management Office (OMB) Office. FedRAMP continuous monitoring
strategy and guide, version 2.0. Washington, DC: US General Services Administration; 2014. For
incidents that are detected by the federal agency, “the CSP should work with the agency to deter-
mine if the incident is local to the agency host (or hosts), or is part of a larger incident that affects
the CSP’s underlying cloud infrastructure—affecting multiple cloud tenants.”

Operational Visibility and Continuous Monitoring
INTRODUCTION
Security automation is an essential part of an information security program,
enabling organizations to achieve more efficiency in monitoring activities. Not all
continuous monitoring (CM) can be accomplished through automation. However,
where automation is applied, an organization can more cost-effectively monitor
and continually assess security controls. The result of using security automation
enhances the security-related information produced from monitoring activities,
offering a more accurate measure of the state of the organization’s security
posture. Security automation is supported by the metrics established by the orga-
nization for the collection and analysis of the needed security-related information.
This information becomes a valuable input into the organization’s risk manage-
ment function, thereby enabling the organization’s management to realize “near
real-time,” risk-based decision-making.
Tools and technologies used in CM provide the organization with insight into
the security controls that can be automated. However, in some circumstances
manual monitoring may still be required in the organization’s security program.
This is important to note, because manual monitoring can still serve as a viable
option, specifically in cases where the organization’s CM strategy is still maturing
and metrics required for the collection of information are largely undefined.
The CM strategy should address the people, processes, technologies and the
environment. In addition, the CM strategy does not focus solely on the security-
related information that is easy for an organization to collect or easy to automate
[1]. Therefore, where automation is used, the organization will also need to ensure
that the strategy reflects its role to ensure that it achieves the desired efficiency in

obtaining outcome-oriented results. For example, where large volumes of security-
related information are collected, automation augments existing processes by
reducing the burden and potential errors associated with the human aspects1 of con-
ducting analysis. Automation also supports the organization by interpreting2 the
collected data to enable stakeholders to make more informed, risk-based decisions.
Automation is not a replacement for the human element in an information
security program. The application of automation within an organization’s CM
strategy should be linked to the existing processes (or new processes3 where gaps
exist) to ensure that the organization understands the associated impact in the
potential loss of visibility and efficiency due to a compromise in the tools and
technologies relied upon when making risk-based decisions. This will also guide
the organization in ensuring any automation that is used to supplement monitoring
capabilities4 within the information security program is appropriately protected.
As illustrated in Fig. 13.1, CM plays a critical role in the organization’s risk
management strategy. The use of automated tools facilitates the collection of “a
larger and more diverse pool of technologies, people, processes, and environ-
ments” [1]. However, the selection of the tools and technologies should be con-
sidered only after the organization has thoroughly defined the metrics that the
organization will use as a basis for analyzing and responding5 to findings through
the organization’s risk management processes.

CHAPTER 13 Continuous monitoring through security automation

Through the development of metrics, the organization can identify the tools
and technologies that present the necessary information at a frequency consistent
with those defined in the strategy.
TIP
Tools and technologies enhance CM activities. Several considerations [1] when selecting tools
and technologies to support automation capabilities include:
•
Collection sources.6
•
Open specification support (e.g., SCAP7).
•
Interoperability.
•
Reporting.
•
Data aggregation.
This chapter will focus on CM reference architectures developed to support
the identification of tools and technologies that enable organizations to automate
different aspects of CM (i.e., gathering, aggregating, analyzing, and reporting).
Additionally, existing and emerging security automation standards and specifica-
tions will be briefly discussed as a means of addressing the importance of stan-
dardization in the reporting and the exchange of data when organizations
implement security automation in CM-related activities.

Introduction

CM REFERENCE ARCHITECTURES
A CM reference architecture is an abstract depiction of the components and inter-
faces that must exist within a CM implementation. It operates as a template that
can be customized through a specific set of CM solutions. In addition, using a
CM reference architecture, such as those that will be discussed in this section,
assists organizations in selecting the tools and technologies that can be used to
efficiently and effectively gather, aggregate, analyze, and report data collected
through CM activities.
CONTINUOUS ASSET EVALUATION, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS,
AND RISK SCORING REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), developed a reference architec-
ture that provided an abstraction of a security posture monitoring and risk scoring
system, that is informed by computing and network assets that can be used by other
federal agencies seeking to apply risk scoring principles to their information secu-
rity program [2]. The DHS Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational Awareness,
and Risk Scoring (CAESARS) reference architecture report provided the initial
framework for implementing monitoring process and for establishing requirements
for automated tool selection and integration. For completeness and for illustration
purposes, Fig. 13.2 provides a view of the CAESAR subsystems. In the next
section, the follow-on reference architecture CAESARS Framework Extension (FE)
developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an enterprise
continuously monitoring technical reference model, will be discussed with addi-
tional detail as it relates to supporting automation in a CM program.
CAESARS FRAMEWORK EXTENSION REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE
The CAESARS FE is an enhanced version of the CM reference architecture that
was developed by DHS. The specific differences will not be discussed in this
chapter, but it is important to note that the essential characteristics have remained
the same, with differences focused on adding additional functionality, granularity
within subsystem specifications, and to further leverage existing and emerging
security automation standards [3]. The CAESARS FE is a conceptual model used
to enable the real-time capabilities of the NIST Risk Management Framework
(RMF)8 with specific emphasis placed on automating CM (RMF Step) functions.
Through an elaboration of a technical architecture using the model presented
in the CAESARS FE, tools and technologies can be developed that facilitate CM
within an enterprise and make information available to support risk-based
decision-making.
8NIST RMF is discussed in detail in Chapter 5, Applying the Risk Management Framework.
456
CHAPTER 13 Continuous monitoring through security automation

In this section, the subsystems and components, and specifications will be
briefly discussed, followed by a description of how the application of the
CAESAR FE technical reference model supports each of the data domains.9
Although a specific discussion of security automation domains10 is beyond the
scope of this book, it is important to list those domains identified [1] that require
support by the CM reference technical model11 as shown in Table 13.1.

management, etc.). The subsystems and components are meant to be independent
and security tool and technology agnostic.
Therefore, it is important to understand the intent of the subsystems and com-
ponents to enable organizations to apply the technical reference model in a way
that will assist in identifying and implementing CM capabilities that result in a
solution that cost-effectively supports the CM requirements. Below is an overview
of each of the subsystems and components:
•
The presentation/reporting subsystem, consisting of the dashboard engine, is
the source for user input/outputs. Within the CM system instance, this
subsystem would primarily interface with the task manager subsystem using
queries designed to fulfill user requests for security-related information.
•
The task manager subsystem performs the orchestration in the CM system
instance between the analysis/scoring, data aggregation, presentation/reporting,
and collection subsystems. This subsystem performs the orchestration through
use of several components, such as the query orchestration, collection
controller, and decision engine.
•
The collection subsystem collects data based on a user query (task manager),
using content that describes the organization’s policies (content), and stores
the results (data aggregation). When a multitiered12 CM capability is used, as
illustrated in Fig. 13.4, a collection subsystem may not exist within all of the
CM instances.13 It is also important to highlight that a collection subsystem is

Interagency Report (IR) 7756 (Second Draft), CAESARS Framework Extension: An Enterprise
Continuous Monitoring Technical Reference Model. Maryland: National Institute of Standards and
Technology; 2012. In a multitiered CM situation, a CM instance higher in the hierarchy may not
have any assets to monitor, but instead rely upon data feeds from lower tier CM instances.
13More than one CM instance can be used in organizations that have a need to structure the CM imple-
mentation organization-wide to support the different tiers of decision-makers within the CM program
(e.g., tier 1—governance, tier 2—mission/business processes, and tier 3—information system).

not a core component of the CM implementation and could be an external
system that interfaces with a CM instance.
•
The data aggregation subsystem is the central repository for data (e.g., raw,
analyzed, etc.). This subsystem consists of multiple repositories: system
state, asset, metrics, and metadata. The data aggregation subsystem
interfaces with other subsystems such as input from the collection subsystem
for storage of raw collected data, raw data retrieval, and analyzed data
storage from the analysis/scoring subsystem, and query result storage from
task managers that exist in lower-tiers in a multitiered hierarchical model [3]
(see Fig. 13.3).
•
The analysis/scoring subsystem provides the analysis and scoring function
within the CM implementation, potentially supporting multiple scoring
methodologies analysis engine components. This subsystem is a critical
component of the CM implementation. It receives queries from the task
manager subsystem, retrieves and stores data in the data aggregation
subsystem, and obtains scoring algorithms, parameters, and associated scoring
data from the content subsystem [3].
•
The content subsystem maintains the organizational policies that are used to
compare system state. The primary purpose of this subsystem is to maintain the
policies (e.g., security baselines configurations) and supporting data (e.g.,
enumeration of products being evaluated, or vulnerabilities being identified) that
are used by the collection subsystem(s) or the analysis/risk scoring subsystem(s).
Since an organization may have a single source for storing organizational
policies, only one content subsystem would be required for an entire CM
implementation to enable sharing among the different CM instances.
Specifications: Workflows, subsystems, and interfaces
The CAESARS FE technical specification consists of the workflows, subsystems,
and interfaces that enable the implementation of the CM reference model. The work-
flows specifications define the “coordinated operations of all the subsystems and
components within the model” [4]. The subsystem specifications enable subsystems
to operate as independent and tool agnostic, “plug-in-play” modules that are
interoperable between CM implementations. Since subsystems perform an indepen-
dent role within the CM implementation, clearly defining the required functionality
at a “generic” level enables easier integration of different products/services. The last
specification, the interfaces, plays an essential role in bridging the communication
between the individual subsystems and facilitating workflow interactions.
This section is not intended to provide a detailed description of these specifi-
cations, but instead to provide a general overview to expand the discussion of the
CAESARS FE as a technical reference model for identifying tools and technolo-
gies that can be integrated into CM solutions to assist Cloud Service Providers
(CSPs) in addressing the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
(FedRAMP) operational visibility and other CM requirements. Through the selec-
tion of CSPs that implement the specifications, federal agencies can focus on

continuously monitoring security-related information across the enterprise (i.e.,
hardware, software, and services) under a single governance structure to include
those mission/business processes that have been extended to the cloud service
environment.14

ence model description to a technical specification that links the CM implementa-
tion

(e.g.,

the scope of this book.
Workflows
As described earlier, workflows provide coordinated operations for moving data
within the CM technical reference model. Workflows describe specific use cases
that are driven by the necessity for different subsystems and components to inter-
operate to perform a specific function (e.g., acquiring data through collection and
reporting, fulfilling queries requests). For example, a workflow for the data acqui-
sition involves the collection subsystem interacting with other subsystems to sup-
port the acquisition of data. Fig. 13.6 provides an illustration for how this
workflow would be executed in a CM implementation. Omitted from the diagram
is specific component interaction within the workflow. Since components within
a subsystem collectively support the subsystem’s implementation of a specific
requirement within a workflow (e.g., collection controller initiating a task to the
collection subsystem to collect data would be sent by the task manager), the
actions of components have been abstracted to the subsystem level.

CHAPTER 13 Continuous monitoring through security automation

Subsystems
The subsystem specifications provide a detailed description of the requirements
that must be supported by a specific subsystem to effectively implement the CM
technical reference model. Since the specifications are data domain agnostic, they
are not specifically linked with a specific monitoring domain (i.e., asset manage-
ment, configuration management, vulnerability management). Instead, the specifi-
cations describe the capabilities that must be supported by individual components.
For example, the collection controller within the task manager subsystem provides
the capability to process tasks (task processing18) and initiate data collection tasks
(subtask propagation19) [4]. For the task manager to support the ability to initiate
a task to request the collection of data from a user query, the task manager needs
to be able to support multiple capabilities offered through these discrete services
that interact within the CM implementation to support workflows.
Interfaces
Interface specifications provide the standardized mechanism in which subsystems
can effectively communicate with each other and enable them to operate as inde-
pendent modules that, when collectively implemented, support the entire CM
technical
reference
model.
Interfaces
are
exposed
through
Web
Services
Definition Language (WSDL)20 that describes the web services implemented
within the subsystem(s) where the interface exists. For example, Fig. 13.7

provides an oversimplified illustration of the “Results Reporting” interface that is
implemented by the Data Aggregation subsystem that enables other subsystems
and components to send asset information for storage [4]. The WSDL describes
the services(s) that are supported by the interface and the requirements for send-
ing the asset21 information (e.g., Asset Reporting Format (ARF)22).
SECURITY AUTOMATION STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS
The implementation of CM requires using tools and technologies that are based
on standards and specifications that are open and industry-supported. Standards
and specifications provide a foundation for implementing automation that pro-
motes portability and interoperability across tool sets and domain boundaries. As
discussed earlier, the layer 2 in the CAESARS FE technical reference model
binds the reference model to data domains (e.g., asset management,23 configura-
tion management,24 and vulnerability management25). This section is not intended
to be a comprehensive review of all security automation standards and specifica-
tions, but instead will provide a high-level overview that furthers investigation.

SECURITY CONTENT AUTOMATION PROTOCOL
The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)26 provides the bindings for
supporting the layer 2 data domains through a series of specifications. SCAP pro-
vides a “suite of specifications that standardize the format and nomenclature by
which software flaw and security configuration information is communicated,
both to machines and humans” [5] that includes: languages (XCCDF,27 OVAL,28
OCIL29), reporting formats (ARF30), enumerations (CPE,31 CCE,32 and CVE33),
measurement and scoring systems (CVSS,34 CCSS35), and supports the preserva-
tion of integrity (TMSAF36) of content and results. Table 13.2 provides a descrip-
tion of the five categories that cover the component specifications included within
SCAP.

CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK
Cybersecurity Information Exchange (CYBEX)37 was originally produced in
2011 and later amended in 2016 by the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) Study Group (SG) 17.38 CYBEX provides a model and technique for
exchanging cybersecurity information (e.g., vulnerability and incident). It focuses
on providing the means to support a trusted bi-directional exchange, but does not
extend to the acquisition or use of the cybersecurity information that is contained
within the organization’s boundary. Although CYBEX is an international specifi-
cation, it is briefly mentioned here as it relates to supporting the CAESARS FE
where CM implementations within different organizational security boundaries
are required to support the exchange of security-related information.
OPERATIONAL VISIBILITY AND CONTINUOUS MONITORING
The FedRAMP’s ongoing assessment and authorization process includes a
requirement for operational visibility and CM requirements. In Fig. 13.8, the
CAESARS FE (discussed earlier in this chapter) is shown alongside the Cloud
Security Alliance (CSA) Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC)
Stack.
The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate how the GRC Stack can support
many of the aspects of the operational visibility and CM requirements. In this sec-
tion, the focus will be on providing an introduction to the components of the
GRC Stack and a description of how they collectively can be used by CSPs,
Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs), and the federal government to
achieve cost-effective compliance, and obtain security-related information to sup-
port CM activities.
Operational visibility focuses on demonstrating compliance on an ongoing
basis through automated and manual processes. CSPs are required to provide data
feeds (automated/manual), periodically assess security controls to determine con-
tinued effectiveness, and a report (annually) through a self-attestation certifica-
tion. The data feeds should be in a compatible format that can be consumed by
the CyberScope.39 CyberScope is an application that enables the federal govern-
ment to support an “on-demand” view of the government-wide security posture.
To enable the ability to achieve near “real-time” risk management, the
CyberScope application must handle manual and automated inputs from federal
agencies based on data feeds produced using SCAP for Federal information

Security Modernization Act (FISMA) reporting [6]. The annual assessment
requires a 3PAO to conduct an assessment and the CSP’s cloud service environ-
ment to certify the accuracy of the results before being submitted to the
FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) and the leveraging federal
agency to assist in integrating the cloud service into the enterprise-wide risk
management process when making risk-based decisions.
The GRC Stack, depicted in Figure 13.8, comprises of four components:
Cloud Control Matrix (CCM), Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire
(CAIQ), CloudAudit, and Cloud Trust Protocol (CTP). The CCM “is specifically
designed to provide fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors and to
assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of a cloud
provider” [7]. The CCM provides a mapping between multiple compliance frame-
works to include the FedRAMP security controls.40 The CAIQ “provides a set of
questions a cloud consumer and cloud auditor may wish to ask of a cloud pro-
vider” [8]. The questions are aligned with the control requirements defined in the
CCM. The next component is CloudAudit, which provides a common interface
and namespace that enables streamlining the audit processes [9]. The last compo-
nent, the CTP, is a mechanism by which consumers request for and receive infor-
mation about the elements of transparency (EoT)41 as applied to CSPs [10].
The data feeds focus on obtaining information to enable federal agencies to
report on the level of performance of FISMA metrics42 for asset management,
configuration management, and vulnerability management. The CTP EoTs 34
(configuration information) and 57 (vulnerability information) focus on collect-
ing and returning information, in a SCAP-consistent format, about the assets
being used by the federal agency within the cloud service environment.

CHAPTER 13 Continuous monitoring through security automation

The periodic assessment of security controls may be performed by a CSP to
support other obligations of compliance or to support contractual requirements
(or service-level agreements). The CCM, CAIQ, and CloudAudit collectively enable
CSPs to perform internal assessment and third-party assessors (i.e., 3PAOs) to obtain
evidence of security control implementation and continued effectiveness. As illus-
trated in Figure 13.8, the CCM includes mappings to multiple frameworks that
address those requirements defined by FedRAMP. The CAIQ can be converted into
an OCIL-compliant automated checklist (questionnaire) that can be used to collect
information through the assessment of security controls related to people and pro-
cesses. This is specifically useful when assessing security controls that cannot be
completely or fully monitored through security automation tools and technologies.
CloudAudit provides a specification for a common namespace which aligns with
the CCM to reduce the complexity of 3PAOs in collecting and storing evidentiary
artifacts that support a CSPs’ expression of its ability to meet compliance obligations.
SUMMARY
The use of security automation within information security programs focuses on
achieving efficiency in the monitoring of security controls implemented within infor-
mation systems. Automating CM activities requires understanding the processes that
will be used by the organization, including the tools and technologies to provide a
more frequent collection and analysis of security-related information. Therefore, the
organization will need to ensure the CM strategy includes both a defined set of
metrics and processes that will be used to monitor and respond to findings. Within
FedRAMP the CSP’s CM capability supports the ongoing authorization and reautho-
rization decisions. Through the implementation of security automation, the CSP can
more cost-effectively provide assurance of the security controls implemented and the
confidence in their effectiveness. The CSA GRC Stack addresses many of the aspects
of the operational visibility and CM requirements of FedRAMP and supports federal
agencies in reclaiming the transparency into the security posture of cloud services,
enabling them to make more informed, risk-based decisions.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
•
Case Study Scenario: “Healthcare Exchange”
•
Applying the Risk Management Framework within FedRAMP
CASE STUDY SCENARIO: “HEALTHCARE EXCHANGE”
The Patient Privacy and Protection Act,1 recently signed into law, creates a new
requirement for patient healthcare exchanges to be built, herein referred to as
“Healthcare Exchanges.” The “Federal Agency” responsible for implementing
the requirements of the law chose to use an operating expense model instead of a
capital expense model; usage-based pricing for processing, storage, bandwidth,
and license management; and support for elasticity as demand for computing
resources may change over time.
Since the “Federal Agency” will require collaboration with external partners
to support the development of State Healthcare Exchanges, the “Federal
Agency” chose to acquire Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a
Service (PaaS) environments from one provider to support the delivery of
a computing platform and an application platform (similar to the cloud
configuration use case included in Fig. 14.1). This allows the States to build,
test, deploy, and run portable, interoperable, and secure State “Healthcare
Exchanges.” This also enables the Federal Agency to quickly meet its require-
ments under the new law. In addition, the IaaS/PaaS environments will be used
by other federal agencies to support the development of a federal “Healthcare
Exchange” and other functions required to share information between State
and federal government entities.
The cloud computing environment will also be used to support the “Federal
Agency” mission and will contain federal information and information systems.
Therefore, the infrastructure and platform environment of the cloud computing
stack will be required to address federal cloud computing security standards.
To reduce the complexity, the scenario will be limited to a discussion of only the
federal “Healthcare Exchange.” The cloud computing infrastructure (IaaS/PaaS)

will be required to address not only federal information security requirements
under Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP),
but also to meet all data management safeguard requirements required for the pro-
tection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Health Information
(PHI), and Federal Tax Information (FTI) data.
In this chapter, we will discuss the application of the FedRAMP deliverable
documents from the FedRAMP Security Assessment Framework (SAF). The case
study in this section will be used to support the discussion.
APPLYING THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
WITHIN FEDRAMP
This section will focus on the application of Steps 14 of the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF),
which corresponds to document, assess, and authorize phases of the FedRAMP
SAF (see Fig. 14.2). The case study provided in the last section will be used as a
basis for discussing how to approach using the FedRAMP deliverables to support
a FedRAMP Provisional Authorization.
TIP
At this point, the most critical step in the process is for the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) to
conduct an in-depth analysis of their security authorization boundary. The CSP will need to be
very clear where the security authorization boundary starts and ends. The CSP will need to
develop a system description and inventory that can be clearly understood by the “Federal
Agency” and the Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO). The system description will need
to be both a physical and logical inventory of what components, assets, and data will be part of
the security authorization boundary. As a rule of thumb, the CSP should develop a system
description that clearly describes the data-flow (showing the flow of ports, protocols, and services
of all system assets) and network diagrams included in their security authorization boundary.

The CSP must identify the applicable information types and conduct a security
categorization2 of the cloud service to determine the impact level. As depicted in
Fig. 14.3, the CSP can use available federal governmental standards, guidelines,
and regulations, and industry-specific “best practices” to assist in establishing a
characterization of types of information currently stored, processed, or transmitted
in the cloud service environment. The Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) 199 analysis represents the information type and sensitivity levels of the
CSP’s cloud service offering and is not intended to include sensitivity levels
for federal agency customer data, because they will be expected to perform a
separate FIPS 199 analysis for federal information hosted on the CSP’s cloud
environment [3]. Once the CSP has identified all the potential information types,
the CSP will need to document this information in the FIPS 199.3
FIGURE 14.2
FedRAMP risk management framework [2].
2Security categorization is discussed in detail in Chapter 5, Applying the Risk Management
Framework.
3From FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO). FedRAMP Template and Process Quick Guide.
Washington, DC: US General Services Administration; 2012. “The Federal Information Processing
Standard 199 (FIPS 199) Categorization (Security Categorization) report is a key document in the secu-
rity authorization package developed for submission to the Federal Risk and Authorization Management
Program (FedRAMP) authorizing officials. The FIPS 199 Categorization report includes the determina-
tion of the security impact level for the cloud environment that may host any or all of the service models
[Information as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)]. The
ultimate goal of the security categorization is for the cloud service provider (CSP) to be able to select
and implement the FedRAMP security controls applicable to its environment.”

FIGURE 14.3
Role of cloud service provider in the security categorization process.

In documenting the FIPS 199, the CSP will need to provide an overview of
the cloud service (i.e., high-level system description). Cloud services generally
operate through the concept of a shared responsibility model, where both the
CSP and the “Federal Agency” consumer will share the responsibility4 for
specific aspects of securing the cloud environment. Therefore, the FIPS 199
completed by the CSP will need to address only5 the information types and
sensitivity levels of the cloud service for which the CSP is responsible.
For example, Table 14.1 provides the information types that may be applicable
to the IaaS and PaaS provider.
However, if the CSP operated a Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud service,
all applicable information types will need to be examined. This may require
the CSP to become familiar with the specific business use cases6 and the types
of information that the “Federal Agency” customer would process, store,
or transmit in the cloud environment as a basis for determining the security
categorization of the cloud service. This activity would be accomplished by
using publicly available information from government-wide or agency-specific
Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)7 or Federal Segment Architecture
(FSA) documentation. A segment architecture is a “detailed results-oriented
architecture (baseline and target) and a transition strategy for a portion or
segment8 of the enterprise” [5]. Tables 14.214.4 provide a list of potential
information types and the recommended (provisional9) impact levels for the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability security objective of Low, Moderate,
or High Baselines.

TIP
If the CSP determines, through a review of the recommended impact levels, that there are
differences in the selected impact levels, the CSP will need to provide justification (rationale) for
any changes. During the review, the following factors [6] can be used to assist the CSP in
determining if the impact levels should be adjusted based on the applicable security objectives:
•
Sensitivity of change of information when aggregated.
•
Compromise in critical system functionality.
•
Elevation based on extenuating circumstances.
•
Integrity of public information, loss of system availability, privacy information, and so on.
The role of the “Federal Agency” in the security categorization process is the
characterization of the information that it plans to store, process, or transmit in
the cloud service. The application of the security categorization process by the
“Federal Agency” will require an evaluation of multiple sources of information10

as the basis for determining the security objectives for the types of information
that will be processed, transmitted, or stored in the cloud service. The sources
of information include, but not limited to, the organizational input from key
stakeholders (e.g., other federal agencies and State partners), the architectural
descriptions of the “Healthcare Exchange,” and EA reference models used to
establish a business case.11
The “Federal Agency” established a business case12 for the “Healthcare
Exchange” information technology (IT) investment. The “Healthcare Exchange”
provides a platform for organizing health information. The “Federal Agency”
identified two mission-essential functions supported by the IT investment:
Exchange Systems and Data Services. Through an evaluation of the architectural
descriptions (e.g., architecture reference models, mission, and business processes,
etc.), organizational inputs (laws, directives, policy guidance, etc.), and specific
mission-based information,13 management and support information14 can be
identified and categorized using information associated with the “Healthcare
Exchange” as a point of reference to understand the potential impact due to a
compromise in the confidentiality (C), integrity (I), and availability (A).

of the business and information requirements in the Technical Reference

The “Federal Agency” also identified key data types in Table 14.5 to use as a
basis for characterizing the types of information that will require the highest
level of protection when conducting security categorization. In addition, a list of
related laws, standards, guidelines, and organizational agreements for consider-
ation was developed and mapped against the “Healthcare Exchange” participants
as organizational inputs into the security categorization process.
Based on the case study used in this section, several potential information
types may be selected by the “Federal Agency” such as:

TIP
Before categorizing the cloud service, the CSP conducts a comprehensive system inventory and
creates a system description. This allowed the CSP to create two major architecture drawings that
may or may not have been part of the Enterprise Architecture (EA). Most CSP’s should have at least
created a mission statement, data-flow, and network diagram of their security authorization boundary.
The process of identifying all of the information types stored, processed, or transmitted is not
as straight forward as it may seem for the cloud service. Information types have been identified at
a high-level based on the cloud service description. However, the CSP may need to gather
additional information (developer, system administration, back-up guides) about every component
in the authorization boundary, requiring the CSP to take additional time in reviewing the database
schemas to understand all of the information types that will be used in their cloud service.
The FedRAMP FIPS 199 Categorization Template requires the CSP to provide the
system description. For each information type they will have identified, NIST SP 800-60 provides
a recommendation for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Although NIST has made
recommendations, the CSP may need to adjust the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability) provisional impact level for the cloud service to ensure the impact levels more
closely align with how the information types used to meet our cloud services’ specific
requirements. Pay special attention to “Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
Determination” in NIST SP 800-60 Volume 2 when selecting a higher or lower CIA. Whether the
CSP adjusts the CIA up or down, the CSP will need to explain their rationale.
It is essential that the CSP understand all of the components that reside in their cloud service
authorization boundary, including all corporate components outside the IaaS or PaaS boundary
drawings and inventory. For example, the CSP may have an HR database that creates and feeds
credentials to their user shares after a new employee is processed for their position. This
component is important to the IaaS and may also be required to comply with the FedRAMP
security control requirements.
SELECT SECURITY CONTROLS
The security control selection process relies on the definition of the security control
boundary and a clear delineation of the security controls responsibility across
service and deployment models. It also requires an understanding of any

decomposition of cloud services into associated subsystems and the mapping of
data flows to ensure that adequate protective measures are applied cost-effectively
to sensitive data throughout the cloud service lifecycle.
The implementation of the “Healthcare Exchange” includes a complicated set of
security and privacy requirements. Fig. 14.5 illustrates the different requirements
derived from various laws, requirements, standards, guidelines, and control frame-
works, in addition to any organization-specific requirements established by the infor-
mation sharing agreement.23 For example, under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rule, covered entities
“must comply with the Rules’ requirements to protect the privacy and security of
health information and must provide individuals with certain rights with respect to
their health information” [11]. These requirements could include the additional
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that exceed the security control
requirements defined in the FedRAMP baseline security controls.24
Defining the boundary
The first step in the security control selection process is to define the boundary.25
We have already covered this process earlier and cannot highlight the importance
of doing this right the first time and keeping it up-to-date as the boundary
changes. This provides the scope of protection for the system components and
interfaces for interconnections and is critical for understanding and clarifying
the shared responsibilities for implementing, monitoring, and assessing security
controls allocated26 across the various cloud service and deployment models.

factors that might be considered when allocating security controls and assigning
ownership between the CSP and the “Federal Agency.” For example, identifying
those controls that are inherited from one or more organizations (common
controls) or are shared between one or more organizations (hybrid controls),
requires establishing roles and responsibilities based on the different deployment
models and service models.
In addition, establishing a definition of both the authorization boundary and
the level of control of the resources can help clarify the delineation of the specific
aspects being inherited. For security control allocation to be successful, in most
cases, it requires building trusted relationships based on the sharing of evidence
that specific security controls are implemented, including any assessment results
(or a summary) and information collected as part of an ongoing continuous
monitoring program. The Control Implementation Summary (CIS)27 will be used
by the CSP to indicate who owns the responsibility (or the shared responsibility)
to implement and manage the controls, and the implementation status of the
controls [12].
TIP
Inheritance requires the CSP to be explicit about the “what” and “how” of the control.
Specifically, the CSP needs to describe the control and all of the specific details that are
required to inherit the control. The CSP should explain not only the control implementation
but also explicit information about what must be done to inherit the control or the “how.”
For example, we know that we must have a policy and procedure for each control family.
The CSP may write the policy and select common but forget to be explicit to the organization
inheriting the control that they must create their own procedure for the policy to fully inherit
the control.
In this scenario, the CSP provides the implementation status (i.e., in-place,
partially implemented, planned, alternative implementation, and not applicable)
for security control implementations that relates to the infrastructure and the
platform, and indicates where the security control originates (i.e., service provider
corporate network, service provider cloud service-specific, shared between the
cloud service and the corporate network, configured by the customer, customer-
specific hardware/software, and shared management between the service provider
and the customer).
Tailoring and supplementing
The security controls selection process uses the security categorization to deter-
mine the appropriate initial baseline of security controls (i.e., low, moderate, or

high) that will provide adequate protection for the information and information
systems that reside within the cloud service environment. A cloud service may
require the implementation of alternative or compensating security controls not
included in the initial baseline, or adding additional security controls or enhance-
ments to address unique organizational needs based on a risk assessment or
organization-specific security requirements.
Tailoring and supplementing the baseline is important in our scenario as
the FedRAMP baseline requirements will not only need to be met, but a gap
analysis28 will need to be performed against specific protection requirements
based on the type of information being stored, processed, or transmitted
(e.g., PII, PHI, FTI), but also regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA) or Agency-
specific requirements. Although many of these controls can be mapped to the
security and privacy requirements in NIST SP 800-53, some are very specific to
the type of data (PII, PHI) and the additional control requirements (HIPAA and
Agency Controls).
IMPLEMENT AND DOCUMENT SECURITY CONTROLS
Documenting security controls within the cloud service requires the CSP to
describe how the security controls were implemented in the System Security
Plan (SSP). In the previous section, security controls were allocated based on
specific responsibilities (i.e., inherited by another organization, shared between
organizations, or implemented by an organization). In the SSP, information sys-
tem components will need to be described based on the authorization boundary.
The SSP details how the implementations address each required security control
and enhancement in the selected, tailored, and supplemented security control
baseline, descriptions of roles and responsibilities, and expected behavior of
individuals with system access [12].
In addition, some security controls may require developing supporting
documentation. For example, Table 14.6 identifies some of the documents that
will be implemented by the CSP for FedRAMP.

Washington, DC: US General Services Administration; 2014. “For each cloud system, agencies
should review the implemented security controls, and perform a gap analysis using the FedRAMP
security control baseline to identify which security controls are missing. A gap analysis identifies
which new security controls must be implemented on the respective cloud system. The gap analysis
can serve as an agenda item for meetings with the cloud service provider. Agencies will need to
work in concert with their CSPs to implement missing security controls required by the FedRAMP
baseline.”

TIP
When implementing security controls, one of the most important things the CSP can do is ensure
that they have adopted and documented a security baseline for their system boundary. Poor
implementation of a baseline will become very apparent when the CSP or the 3PAO conducts
authenticated scans of the environment. Therefore, the CSP needs to decide how they are going to
lock-down each type of technology deployed (facilities, hardware, firmware, software, and
applications). The 3PAO is required to use the same type of scanners (static code, vulnerability,
database, web, and application) the CSP uses to conduct ongoing assessments, therefore the CSP
should be able to validate the baseline before engaging the 3PAO to conduct the test.
Below are the pros and cons of the three most common baseline option referred to in NIST SP
800-7029:
1. DoD Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)
a. Pros:
i. Provide extensive guidance on how to lock-down just about every type of technology
ii. Supported by the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
iii. Available from http://iase.disa.mil/ (some require PKI DoD Certificate for access)
b. Cons:
i. Very difficult and time-consuming if the CSP has never implemented STIGs
Automation tools are very critical in the successful implementation
ii. The CSP must test each setting to ensure that it does not adversely affect the operation
of their system  then write a deviation or risk acceptance of why the CSP is not
implementing the setting.
2. Center for Internet Security (CIS) Baseline
a. Pros:
i. Strong commercial support and documentation
ii. Supported by the SCAP
b. Cons:
i. Can be very expensive to implement
ii. Some of the settings may not be acceptable and require the CSP to supplement with
similar settings from DoD STIGs
3. CSP-Specific Baseline
a. Pros
i. Allows the CSP to select their security settings and map them to NIST SP 800-53 and
other compliance requirements such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards
(PCI DSS) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
ii. Allows the CSP to tailor their baseline to their mission and compliance requirements
b. Cons:
i. Very time-consuming to create and maintain
ii. May cost more to get accessed by the 3PAO
iii. Not usually supported by the SCAP
iv. Some of the settings may not be acceptable and require the CSP to supplement with
similar settings from DoD STIGs

CHAPTER 14 A case study for cloud service providers

ASSESSING SECURITY CONTROLS
The assessment of security controls is primarily driven by the security control
assessor. Within FedRAMP, an accredited 3PAO performs and independently tests
the CSP’s cloud service to determine the effectiveness of security control implemen-
tation [15]. A discussion of the 3PAO’s responsibilities is beyond the scope of this
section. The CSP will need to be prepared for the assessment. Before the 3PAO
conducts any security testing, the CSP may want to perform the entire test according
to the FedRAMP templates, and collect and organize all of the evidence supporting
the security control implementations as documented in the SSP. The CSP will also
need to focus on fixing any critical or high risk security vulnerabilities and develop a
Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms).30
Once the 3PAO has completed conducting an assessment of the security controls,
the Security Assessment Report (SAR)31 is developed, which is used by the CSP as a
source for identifying, documenting, and managing the mitigation32 of “medium”33 and
“high”34 risk security vulnerabilities.35 The POA&M is a tool used by the CSP,
FedRAMP, and the “Federal Agency” when tracking and reporting on the progress of
remediating security weaknesses and deficiencies. The POA&M36 addresses the specific
tasks and resources, including a schedule for completing the remediation activities.
SUMMARY
This chapter presented a short case study to illustrate how the NIST RMF can be
applied within the context of FedRAMP. In addition, some of the various FedRAMP
deliverables were discussed as they relate to the security categorization, security con-
trol selection, and the implementation of the security controls (including supporting
documentation) and documenting corrective actions resulting from the security con-
trols assessment. Since the NIST RMF is a continuous process, documents will require
regular reviews and updates on a continuous basis to address changes to the cloud ser-
vice information system and the operating environment.

the findings and recommendations of the SAR excluding any remediation actions taken.
32FedRAMP specifies 90 days for “medium” and 30 days for “high.”
33Vulnerabilities are labeled “medium” if they have a CVSS base score of 4.06.9.
34Vulnerabilities are labeled “high” if they have a CVSS base score of 7.010.0.
35The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard provides guidance on scoring vul-
nerabilities. Available from: https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document.
36The POA&M document is one of three key documents (SSP, SAR, and POA&M) used by the
JAB to make a determination of a provisional authorization and the federal agency in making a
determination for leveraging the cloud service.
