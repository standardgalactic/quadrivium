Preface
WELCOME TO THE 11TH EDITION
In the eleventh edition of Trigonometry, we continue our ongoing commitment to 
providing the best possible text to help instructors teach and students succeed. In 
this edition, we have remained true to the pedagogical style of the past while staying  
focused on the needs of today’s students. Support for all classroom types (traditional,  
hybrid, and online) may be found in this classic text and its supplements backed by 
the power of Pearson’s MyMathLab.
In this edition, we have drawn upon the extensive teaching experience of the Lial 
team, with special consideration given to reviewer suggestions. General updates include 
enhanced readability with improved layout of examples, better use of color in displays, 
and language written with students in mind. All calculator screenshots have been updated 
and now provide color displays to enhance students’ conceptual understanding. Each 
homework section now begins with a group of Concept Preview exercises, assignable in 
MyMathLab, which may be used to ensure students’ understanding of vocabulary and 
basic concepts prior to beginning the regular homework exercises.
Further enhancements include numerous current data examples and exercises 
that have been updated to reflect current information. Additional real-life exercises 
have been included to pique student interest; answers to writing exercises have been 
provided; better consistency has been achieved between the directions that introduce 
examples and those that introduce the corresponding exercises; and better guidance 
for rounding of answers has been provided in the exercise sets.
The Lial team believes this to be our best Trigonometry edition yet, and we sin-
cerely hope that you enjoy using it as much as we have enjoyed writing it. Additional 
textbooks in this series are as follows:
College Algebra, Twelfth Edition
College Algebra & Trigonometry, Sixth Edition
Precalculus, Sixth Edition
HIGHLIGHTS OF NEW CONTENT
 
■ Discussion of the Pythagorean theorem and the distance formula has been 
moved from an appendix to Chapter 1.
 
■ In Chapter 2, the two sections devoted to applications of right triangles now 
begin with short historical vignettes, to provide motivation and illustrate how 
trigonometry developed as a tool for astronomers.
 
■ The example solutions of applications of angular speed in Chapter 3 have 
been rewritten to illustrate the use of unit fractions.
 
■ In Chapter 4, we have included new applications of periodic functions. They 
involve modeling monthly temperatures of regions in the southern hemisphere 
and fractional part of the moon illuminated for each day of a particular month. 
The example of addition of ordinates in Section 4.4 has been rewritten, and  
a new example of analysis of damped oscillatory motion has been included in 
Section 4.5.
 
■ Chapter 5 now presents a derivation of the product-to-sum identity for the 
product sin A cos B.
 
■ In Chapter 6, we include several new screens of periodic function graphs that 
differ in appearance from typical ones. They pertain to the music phenomena 
of pressure of a plucked spring, beats, and upper harmonics.

xii
PREFACE
 
■ The two sections in Chapter 7 on vectors have been reorganized but still 
cover the same material as in the previous edition. Section 7.4 now introduces  
geometrically defined vectors and applications, and Section 7.5 follows with 
algebraically defined vectors and the dot product.
 
■ In Chapter 8, the examples in Section 8.1 have been reordered for a better 
flow with respect to solving quadratic equations with complex solutions.
 
■ For visual learners, numbered Figure and Example references within the text 
are set using the same typeface as the figure number itself and bold print for 
the example. This makes it easier for the students to identify and connect 
them. We also have increased our use of a “drop down” style, when appropri-
ate, to distinguish between simplifying expressions and solving equations, 
and we have added many more explanatory side comments. Guided Visual-
izations, with accompanying exercises and explorations, are now available 
and assignable in MyMathLab.
 
■ Trigonometry is widely recognized for the quality of its exercises. In the 
eleventh edition, nearly 500 are new or modified, and many present updated 
real-life data. Furthermore, the MyMathLab course has expanded coverage 
of all exercise types appearing in the exercise sets, as well as the mid-chapter 
Quizzes and Summary Exercises.
FEATURES OF THIS TEXT
SUPPORT FOR LEARNING CONCEPTS
We provide a variety of features to support students’ learning of the essential topics 
of trigonometry. Explanations that are written in understandable terms, figures and 
graphs that illustrate examples and concepts, graphing technology that supports and 
enhances algebraic manipulations, and real-life applications that enrich the topics 
with meaning all provide opportunities for students to deepen their understanding 
of mathematics. These features help students make mathematical connections and 
expand their own knowledge base.
 
■ Examples Numbered examples that illustrate the techniques for working 
exercises are found in every section. We use traditional explanations, side 
comments, and pointers to describe the steps taken—and to warn students 
about common pitfalls. Some examples provide additional graphing calcula-
tor solutions, although these can be omitted if desired.
 
■ Now Try Exercises Following each numbered example, the student is 
directed to try a corresponding odd-numbered exercise (or exercises). This 
feature allows for quick feedback to determine whether the student has  
understood the principles illustrated in the example.
 
■ Real-Life Applications We have included hundreds of real-life applica-
tions, many with data updated from the previous edition. They come from fields 
such as sports, biology, astronomy, geology, music, and environmental studies.
 
■ Function Boxes Special function boxes offer a comprehensive, visual 
introduction to each type of trigonometric function and also serve as an 
excellent resource for reference and review. Each function box includes a 
table of values, traditional and calculator-generated graphs, the domain, the 
range, and other special information about the function. These boxes are  
assignable in MyMathLab.
 
■ Figures and Photos Today’s students are more visually oriented than 
ever before, and we have updated the figures and photos in this edition to 

promote visual appeal. Guided Visualizations with accompanying exercises 
and explorations are now available and assignable in MyMathLab.
 
■ Use of Graphing Technology We have integrated the use of graphing 
calculators where appropriate, although this technology is completely op-
tional and can be omitted without loss of continuity. We continue to stress 
that graphing calculators support understanding but that students must first 
master the underlying mathematical concepts. Exercises that require the use 
of a graphing calculator are marked with the icon 
.
 
■ Cautions and Notes Text that is marked CAUTION warns students of 
common errors, and NOTE comments point out explanations that should 
receive particular attention.
 
■ Looking Ahead to Calculus These margin notes offer glimpses of how 
the topics currently being studied are used in calculus.
SUPPORT FOR PRACTICING CONCEPTS
This text offers a wide variety of exercises to help students master trigonometry. 
The extensive exercise sets provide ample opportunity for practice, and the exercise 
problems generally increase in difficulty so that students at every level of under-
standing are challenged. The variety of exercise types promotes understanding of the 
concepts and reduces the need for rote memorization.
 
■ NEW 
Concept Preview Each exercise set now begins with a group 
of CONCEPT PREVIEW exercises designed to promote understanding of vo-
cabulary and basic concepts of each section. These new exercises are assign-
able in MyMathLab and will provide support especially for hybrid, online, 
and flipped courses.
 
■ Exercise Sets In addition to traditional drill exercises, this text includes 
writing exercises, optional graphing calculator problems 
 , and multiple-
choice, matching, true/false, and completion exercises. Concept Check exer-
cises focus on conceptual thinking. Connecting Graphs with Equations  
exercises challenge students to write equations that correspond to given graphs.
 
■ Relating Concepts Exercises Appearing at the end of selected exer-
cise sets, these groups of exercises are designed so that students who work 
them in numerical order will follow a line of reasoning that leads to an un-
derstanding of how various topics and concepts are related. All answers to 
these exercises appear in the student answer section, and these exercises are 
assignable in MyMathLab.
 
■ Complete Solutions to Selected Exercises Complete solutions to 
all exercises marked 
 are available in the eText. These are often exercises 
that extend the skills and concepts presented in the numbered examples.
SUPPORT FOR REVIEW AND TEST PREP
Ample opportunities for review are found within the chapters and at the ends of 
chapters. Quizzes that are interspersed within chapters provide a quick assessment 
of students’ understanding of the material presented up to that point in the chapter. 
Chapter “Test Preps” provide comprehensive study aids to help students prepare 
for tests.
 
■ Quizzes Students can periodically check their progress with in-chapter 
quizzes that appear in all chapters. All answers, with corresponding section 
references, appear in the student answer section. These quizzes are assign-
able in MyMathLab.

PREFACE

xiv
 
■ Summary Exercises These sets of in-chapter exercises give students 
the all-important opportunity to work mixed review exercises, requiring them 
to synthesize concepts and select appropriate solution methods.
 
■ End-of-Chapter Test Prep Following the final numbered section 
in each chapter, the Test Prep provides a list of Key Terms, a list of New  
Symbols (if applicable), and a two-column Quick Review that includes a 
section-by-section summary of concepts and examples. This feature con-
cludes with a comprehensive set of Review Exercises and a Chapter 
Test. The Test Prep, Review Exercises, and Chapter Test are assignable in  
MyMathLab. Additional Cumulative Review homework assignments are 
available in MyMathLab, following every chapter.

Degree Measure 
 The most common unit for measuring angles is the  
degree. Degree measure was developed by the Babylonians 4000 yr ago. To 
use degree measure, we assign 360 degrees to a complete rotation of a ray.* In 
Figure 4, notice that the terminal side of the angle corresponds to its initial side 
when it makes a complete rotation.
One degree, written 1°, represents 1
360 of a complete rotation.
Therefore, 90° represents 90
360 = 1
4 of a complete rotation, and 180° represents 
180
360 = 1
2 of a complete rotation.
An angle measuring between 0° and 90° is an acute angle. An angle mea-
suring exactly 90° is a right angle. The symbol 
m
 is often used at the vertex  
of a right angle to denote the 90° measure. An angle measuring more than 90° 
but less than 180° is an obtuse angle, and an angle of exactly 180° is a straight 
angle.
 1.1 
Angles
Basic Terminology 
 Two distinct points A and B determine a line called 
line AB. The portion of the line between A and B, including points A and B them-
selves, is line segment AB, or simply segment AB. The portion of line AB that 
starts at A and continues through B, and on past B, is the ray AB. Point A is the 
endpoint of the ray. See Figure  1.
In trigonometry, an angle consists of two rays in a plane with a common 
endpoint, or two line segments with a common endpoint. These two rays (or 
segments) are the sides of the angle, and the common endpoint is the vertex of the 
angle. Associated with an angle is its measure, generated by a rotation about 
the vertex. See Figure 2. This measure is determined by rotating a ray starting 
at one side of the angle, the initial side, to the position of the other side, the 
terminal side. A counterclockwise rotation generates a positive measure, and 
a clockwise rotation generates a negative measure. The rotation can consist of 
more than one complete revolution.
Figure 3 shows two angles, one positive and one negative.

An angle can be named by using the name of its vertex. For example, the 
angle on the right in Figure 3 can be named angle C. Alternatively, an angle can 
be named using three letters, with the vertex letter in the middle. Thus, the angle 
on the right also could be named angle ACB or angle BCA.
*The Babylonians were the first to subdivide the circumference of a circle into 360 parts. There are  
various theories about why the number 360 was chosen. One is that it is approximately the number of 
days in a year, and it has many divisors, which makes it convenient to work with in computations.
A complete rotation of a ray
gives an angle whose measure
is 360°.        of a complete
rotation gives an angle whose
measure is 1°.

In Figure 5, we use the Greek letter U (theta)* to name each angle. The table 
in the margin lists the upper- and lowercase Greek letters, which are often used 
in trigonometry.
* In addition to u (theta), other Greek letters such as a (alpha) and b (beta) are used to name angles.

If the sum of the measures of two positive angles is 90°, the angles are comple-
mentary and the angles are complements of each other. Two positive angles with 
measures whose sum is 180° are supplementary, and the angles are supplements.

EXAMPLE 1 
 Finding the Complement and the Supplement of an Angle
Find the measure of (a) the complement and (b) the supplement of an angle 
measuring 40°.
SOLUTION
(a) To find the measure of its complement, subtract the measure of the angle 
from 90°.
90° - 40° = 50°   Complement of 40°
(b) To find the measure of its supplement, subtract the measure of the angle 
from 180°.
180° - 40° = 140°   Supplement of 40°

 Finding Measures of Complementary and  
Supplementary Angles
Find the measure of each marked angle in Figure 6.
SOLUTION
(a) Because the two angles in Figure 6(a) form a right angle, they are comple-
mentary angles.
 6x + 3x = 90   Complementary angles sum to 90°.
 9x = 90   Combine like terms.
 x = 10   Divide by 9.
Don’t stop here.
 
Be sure to determine the measure of each angle by substituting 10 for x in 6x 
and 3x. The two angles have measures of 61102 = 60° and 31102 = 30°.
(b) The angles in Figure 6(b) are supplementary, so their sum must be 180°.
 4x + 6x = 180   Supplementary angles sum to 180°.
 10x = 180   Combine like terms.
 x = 18    Divide by 10.
The angle measures are 4x = 41182 = 72° and 6x = 61182 = 108°.

The measure of angle A in Figure 7 is 35°. This measure is often expressed 
by saying that m1angle A2 is 35°, where m1angle A2 is read “the measure of 
angle A.” The symbolism m1angle A2 = 35° is abbreviated as A = 35°.

Standard Position 
 An angle is in standard position if its vertex is at the 
origin and its initial side lies on the positive x-axis. The angles in Figures 8(a) 
and 8(b) are in standard position. An angle in standard position is said to lie in the  
quadrant in which its terminal side lies. An acute angle is in quadrant I (Figure 8(a)) 
and an obtuse angle is in quadrant II (Figure 8(b)). Figure 8(c) shows ranges of 
angle measures for each quadrant when 0° 6 u 6 360°.

Coterminal Angles 
 A complete rotation of a ray results in an angle meas-
uring 360°. By continuing the rotation, angles of measure larger than 360° can 
be produced. The angles in Figure 9 with measures 60° and 420° have the same 
initial side and the same terminal side, but different amounts of rotation. Such 
angles are coterminal angles. Their measures differ by a multiple of 360°. As 
shown in Figure 10, angles with measures 110° and 830° are coterminal.

Finding Measures of Coterminal Angles
Find the angle of least positive measure that is coterminal with each angle.
(a) 908°      (b) -75°     (c) -800°
SOLUTION
(a) Subtract 360° as many times as needed to obtain an angle with measure 
greater than 0° but less than 360°.
908° - 2 # 360° = 188°   Multiply 2 # 360°. Then subtract.

■✔ Now Try Exercises 81, 91, and 95.
Sometimes it is necessary to find an expression that will generate all angles 
coterminal with a given angle. For example, we can obtain any angle coterminal 
with 60° by adding an integer multiple of 360° to 60°. Let n represent any inte-
ger. Then the following expression represents all such coterminal angles.

Analyzing Revolutions of a Disk Drive
A constant angular velocity disk drive spins a disk at a constant speed. Suppose 
a disk makes 480 revolutions per min. Through how many degrees will a point 
on the edge of the disk move in 2 sec?
SOLUTION The disk revolves 480 times in 1 min, or 480
60  times = 8 times per sec 
(because 60 sec = 1 min). In 2 sec, the disk will revolve 2 # 8 = 16 times. Each 
revolution is 360°, so in 2 sec a point on the edge of the disk will revolve
16 # 360° = 5760°.
A unit analysis expression can also be used.

129. Viewing Field of a Telescope As a consequence of Earth’s rotation, celestial 
objects such as the moon and the stars appear to move across the sky, rising in the 
east and setting in the west. As a result, if a telescope on Earth remains stationary 
while viewing a celestial object, the object will slowly move outside the viewing 
field of the telescope. For this reason, a motor is often attached to telescopes so 
that the telescope rotates at the same rate as Earth. Determine how long it should 
take the motor to turn the telescope through an angle of 1 min in a direction per-
pendicular to Earth’s axis.

 In Figure 13, we extended the sides of angle NMP 
to form another angle, RMQ. The pair of angles NMP and RMQ are vertical  
angles. Another pair of vertical angles, NMQ and PMR, are also formed.  
Vertical angles have the following important property.

Vertical Angles
Vertical angles have equal measures.
Parallel lines are lines that lie in the same 
plane and do not intersect. Figure 14 shows 
parallel lines m and n. When a line q intersects 
two parallel lines, q is called a transversal. 
In Figure 14, the transversal intersecting the 
parallel lines forms eight angles, indicated by

EXAMPLE 1 
Finding Angle Measures
Find the measures of angles 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Figure 15, given that lines m and n 
are parallel.
SOLUTION Angles 1 and 4 are alternate exterior angles, so they are equal.
 3x + 2 = 5x - 40   Alternate exterior angles have equal measures.
 42 = 2x
   Subtract 3x and add 40.
 21 = x
   Divide by 2.
Angle 1 has measure
3x + 2
    = 3 # 21 + 2   Substitute 21 for x.
    = 65°.
   Multiply, and then add.
Angle 4 has measure
5x - 40
    = 5 # 21 - 40   Substitute 21 for x.
    = 65°.
    Multiply, and then  
subtract.
Angle 2 is the supplement of a 65° angle, so it has measure
180° - 65° = 115°.
Angle 3 is a vertical angle to angle 1, so its measure is also 65°. (There are other 
ways to determine these measures.)

CHAPTER 1 Trigonometric Functions
Triangles 
 An important property of triangles, first proved by Greek geom-
eters, deals with the sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle.
Angle Sum of a Triangle
The sum of the measures of the angles of any triangle is 180°.
A rather convincing argument for the truth of this statement uses any size trian-
gle cut from a piece of paper. Tear each corner from the triangle, as suggested in 
Figure 16(a). We should be able to rearrange the pieces so that the three angles 
form a straight angle, which has measure 180°, as shown in Figure 16(b).

Applying the Angle Sum of a Triangle Property
The measures of two of the angles of a triangle are 48° and 61°. See Figure 17. 
Find the measure of the third angle, x.
SOLUTION 
 48° + 61° + x = 180°   The sum of the angles is 180°.
 
 109° + x = 180°   Add.
 
 x = 71°    Subtract 109°.
The third angle of the triangle measures 71°.

Similar triangles are triangles of exactly the same shape but not neces-
sarily the same size. Figure 18 on the next page shows three pairs of similar 
triangles. The two triangles in Figure 18(c) have not only the same shape but 
also the same size. Triangles that are both the same size and the same shape are 
congruent triangles. If two triangles are congruent, then it is possible to pick 
one of them up and place it on top of the other so that they coincide.

Conditions for Similar Triangles
Triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF if the following conditions hold.
1. Corresponding angles have the same measure.
2. Corresponding sides are proportional. (That is, the ratios of their corre-
sponding sides are equal.)
The triangular supports for a child’s swing set are congruent (and thus simi-
lar) triangles, machine-produced with exactly the same dimensions each time. 
These supports are just one example of similar triangles. The supports of a long 
bridge, all the same shape but increasing in size toward the center of the bridge, 
are examples of similar (but not congruent) figures. See the photo.
Consider the correspondence between triangles ABC and DEF in Figure 19.
Angle A corresponds to angle D.
Angle B corresponds to angle E.
Angle C corresponds to angle F.
Side AB corresponds to side DE.
Side BC corresponds to side EF.
Side AC corresponds to side DF.

EXAMPLE 3 
Finding Angle Measures in Similar Triangles
In Figure 20, triangles ABC and NMP are similar. Find all unknown angle  
measures.
SOLUTION First, we find the measure of angle M using the angle sum prop-
erty of a triangle.
 104° + 45° + M = 180°   The sum of the angles is 180°.
 149° + M = 180°   Add.
 M = 31°    Subtract 149°.
The triangles are similar, so corresponding angles have the same measure. 
Because C corresponds to P and P measures 104°, angle C also measures 104°. 
Angles B and M correspond, so B measures 31°.

Finding Side Lengths in Similar Triangles
Given that triangle ABC and triangle DFE in 
Figure 21 are similar, find the lengths of the 
unknown sides of triangle DFE.
SOLUTION Similar triangles have corre-
sponding sides in proportion. Use this fact to 
find the unknown side lengths in triangle DFE.
Side DF of triangle DFE corresponds to side AB of triangle ABC, and sides 
DE and AC correspond. This leads to the following proportion.
8
16 = DF
24
Recall this property of proportions from algebra.
If a
b = c
d
 , then ad = bc.
We use this property to solve the equation for DF.
 8
16 = DF
24
   Corresponding sides are proportional.
 8 # 24 = 16 # DF   If a
b = c
d , then ad = bc.
 192 = 16 # DF   Multiply.
 12 = DF
   Divide by 16.
Side DF has length 12.
Side EF corresponds to CB. This leads to another proportion.
 8
16 = EF
32
   Corresponding sides are proportional.
 8 # 32 = 16 # EF   If a
b = c
d , then ad = bc.
 16 = EF
   Solve for EF.
Side EF has length 16.

with a straightedge and a compass. Why does 
this technique work? (Source: Hamilton, J. E. 
and M. S. Hamilton, Math to Build On, Con-
struction Trades Press.)
   “Draw a straight line segment, and mark a point near the midpoint. Now place 
the tip on the marked point, and draw a semicircle. Without changing the setting  
of the compass, place the tip at the right intersection of the line and the semicircle, 
and then mark a small arc across the semicircle. Finally, draw a line segment from 
the marked point on the original segment to the point where the arc crosses the 
semicircle. This will form a 60° angle with the original segment.”

diameter of about 865,000 mi with a maxi-

94,500,000 mi. The moon has a smaller diam-
eter of 2159 mi. For a total solar eclipse to 
occur, the moon must pass between Earth and 
the sun. The moon must also be close enough 
to Earth for the moon’s umbra (shadow) to reach the surface of Earth. (Source:

73. Sizes and Distances in the Sky Astronomers use degrees, minutes, and seconds to 
measure sizes and distances in the sky along an arc from the horizon to the zenith 
point directly overhead. An adult observer on Earth can judge distances in the sky 
using his or her hand at arm’s length. An outstretched hand will be about 20 arc 
degrees wide from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger. A clenched fist 
at arm’s length measures about 10 arc degrees, and a thumb corresponds to about 
2 arc degrees. (Source: Levy, D. H., Skywatching, The Nature Company.)
(a)  The apparent size of the moon is about 31 arc minutes. Approximately what part 
of your thumb would cover the moon?
(b)  If an outstretched hand plus a fist cover the distance between two bright stars, 
about how far apart in arc degrees are the stars?
74. Estimates of Heights There is a relatively simple way to make a reasonable esti-
mate of a vertical height. 
  Step 1  Hold a 1-ft ruler vertically at arm’s length and approach the object to be 
measured. 
  Step 2  Stop when one end of the ruler lines up with the top of the object and the 
other end with its base. 
  Step 3  Now pace off the distance to the object, taking normal strides. The number 
of paces will be the approximate height of the object in feet.

To find the distance between two points P1x1, y12 and R1x2, y22, draw a line 
segment connecting the points, as shown in Figure 23. Complete a right trian-
gle by drawing a line through 1x1, y12 parallel to the x-axis and a line through 
1x2, y22 parallel to the y-axis. The ordered pair at the right angle is 1x2, y12.
The horizontal side of the right triangle in Figure 23 has length x2 - x1, 
while the vertical side has length y2 - y1. If d represents the distance between 
the two original points, then by the Pythagorean theorem,
d2 = 1x2 - x122 + 1

Suppose that P1x1, y12 and R1x2, y22 are two points in a coordinate plane. 
The distance between P and R, written d1P, R2, is given by the following 
formula.

That is, the distance between two points in a coordinate plane is the square

1.3 Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometric Functions 
 To define the six trigonometric functions, we 
start with an angle u in standard position and choose any point P having coordi-
nates 1x, y2 on the terminal side of angle u. (The point P must not be the vertex 
of the angle.) See Figure 24. A perpendicular from P to the x-axis at point Q 
determines a right triangle, having vertices at O, P, and Q. We find the distance r 
from P1x, y2 to the origin, 10, 02, using the distance formula.
 d1O, P2 = 21x2 - x122 + 1y2 - y122 
Distance formula
 r = 21x - 022 + 1y - 022  
 Substitute 1x, y2 for 1x2, y22  
and 10, 02 for 1x1, y12.
 r = 2x2 + y2
 
Subtract.
Notice that r + 0 because this is the undirected distance.
The six trigonometric functions of angle u are 
sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant, 
abbreviated sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and csc.

EXAMPLE 1 
Finding Function Values of an Angle
The terminal side of an angle u in standard position 
passes through the point 18, 152. Find the values of the 
six trigonometric functions of angle u.
SOLUTION 
Figure 25 shows angle u and the triangle 
formed by dropping a perpendicular from the point 
18, 152 to the x-axis. The point 18, 152 is 8 units to 
the right of the y-axis and 15 units above the x-axis, so 
x = 8 and y = 15. Now use r = 2x2 + y2 .
r = 282 + 152 = 264 + 225 = 2289 = 17
We can now use these values for x, y, and r to find the values of the six trigono-
metric functions of angle u.

Finding Function Values of an Angle
The terminal side of an angle u in standard position passes

We can find the six trigonometric functions using any point other than the 
origin on the terminal side of an angle. To see why any point can be used, refer 
to Figure 27, which shows an angle u and two distinct points on its terminal 
side. Point P has coordinates 1x, y2, and point P′ (read “P-prime”) has coordi-
nates 1x′, y′2. Let r be the length of the hypotenuse of triangle OPQ, and let r  ′ 
be the length of the hypotenuse of triangle OP′Q′. Because corresponding sides 
of similar triangles are proportional, we have
y
r = y′
r′
 . 
Corresponding sides are proportional.
Thus sin u = y
r is the same no matter which point is used to find it. A similar 
result holds for the other five trigonometric functions.
We can also find the trigonometric function values of an angle if we know 
the equation of the line coinciding with the terminal ray. Recall from algebra 
that the graph of the equation
Ax + By = 0   Linear equation in two variables
is a line that passes through the origin 10, 02. If we restrict x to have only nonpos-
itive or only nonnegative values, we obtain as the graph a ray with endpoint at the 
origin. For example, the graph of x + 2y = 0, x Ú 0, shown in Figure 28, is a ray 
that can serve as the terminal side of an angle u in standard position. By choosing 
a point on the ray, we can find the trigonometric function values of the angle.

Recall that when the equation of a line is written in the form

the coefficient m of x gives the slope of the line. In Example 3, the equation  
x + 2y = 0 can be written as y = -  1

EXAMPLE 3 
Finding Function Values of an Angle
Find the six trigonometric function values of an angle u in standard position, if 
the terminal side of u is defined by x + 2y = 0, x Ú 0.
SOLUTION The angle is shown in Figure 29. We can use any point except 10, 02 
on the terminal side of u to find the trigonometric function values. We choose 
x = 2 and find the corresponding y-value.
 x + 2y = 0, x Ú 0
 2 + 2y = 0
   Let x = 2.
 2y = -2
   Subtract 2.
 y = -1
   Divide by 2.
The point 12, -12 lies on the terminal side, and so r = 222 + 1-122 = 25. 
Now we use the definitions of the trigonometric functions.

■✔ Now Try Exercise 51.
Quadrantal Angles 
 If the terminal side of an angle in standard position 
lies along the y-axis, any point on this terminal side has x-coordinate 0. Similarly, 
an angle with terminal side on the x-axis has y-coordinate 0 for any point on the 
terminal side. Because the values of x and y appear in the denominators of some 
trigonometric functions, and because a fraction is undefined if its denominator 
is 0, some trigonometric function values of quadrantal angles (i.e., those with 
terminal side on an axis) are undefined.
When determining trigonometric function values of quadrantal angles, 
Figure 30 can help find the ratios. Because any point on the terminal side can be 
used, it is convenient to choose the point one unit from the origin, with r = 1. 
(Later we will extend this idea to the unit circle.)

the terminal side, choose the one of these four points that lies on this terminal 
side, and then use the definitions involving x, y, and r.

correct values for sin 90° and cos 90°.

for tan 90°, because 90° is not in the

The conditions under which the trigonometric function values of quadrantal 
angles are undefined are summarized here.
Conditions for Undefined Function Values
Identify the terminal side of a quadrantal angle.
r If the terminal side of the quadrantal angle lies along the y-axis, then the 
tangent and secant functions are undefined.
r If the terminal side of the quadrantal angle lies along the x-axis, then the 
cotangent and cosecant functions are undefined.

Signs and Ranges of Function Values 
 In the definitions of the trigo-
nometric functions, r is the distance from the origin to the point 1x, y2. This 
distance is undirected, so r 7 0. If we choose a point 1x, y2 in quadrant I, then 
both x and y will be positive, and the values of all six functions will be positive.
A point 1x, y2 in quadrant II satisfies x 6 0 and y 7 0. This makes the values 
of sine and cosecant positive for quadrant II angles, while the other four functions 
take on negative values. Similar results can be obtained for the other quadrants.
This important information is summarized here.

 Determining Signs of Functions of Nonquadrantal  
Angles
Determine the signs of the trigonometric functions of an angle in standard posi-
tion with the given measure.
(a) 87°      (b) 300°      (c) -200°
SOLUTION
(a) An angle of 87° is in the first quadrant, with x, y, and r all positive, so all of its 
trigonometric function values are positive.
(b) A 300° angle is in quadrant IV, so the cosine and secant are positive, while 
the sine, cosecant, tangent, and cotangent are negative.
(c) A -200° angle is in quadrant II. The sine and cosecant are positive, and all 
other function values are negative.

Figure 35(a) shows an angle u as it increases in measure from near 0° 
toward 90°. In each case, the value of r is the same. As the measure of the angle 
increases, y increases but never exceeds r, so y … r. Dividing both sides by the 
positive number r gives y
r … 1.
In a similar way, angles in quadrant IV as in Figure 35(b) suggest that

The tangent of an angle is defined as y

x 7 y. Thus, y
x can take any value, so tan U can be any real number, as can 
cot U.

Identifying the Quadrant of an Angle
Identify the quadrant (or possible quadrants) of an angle u that satisfies the 
given conditions.
(a) sin u 7 0, tan u 6 0 
(b) cos u 6 0, sec u 6 0
SOLUTION
(a) Because sin u 7 0 in quadrants I and II and tan u 6 0 in quadrants II and IV, 
both conditions are met only in quadrant II.
(b) The cosine and secant functions are both negative in quadrants II and III, so 
in this case u could be in either of these two quadrants.

Determine whether each statement is possible or impossible.
(a) sin u = 2.5    (b) tan u = 110.47    (c) sec u = 0.6
SOLUTION
(a) For any value of u, we know that -1 … sin u … 1. Because 2.5 7 1, it is 
impossible to find a value of u that satisfies sin u = 2.5.
(b) The tangent function can take on any real number value. Thus, tan u = 110.47 
is possible.
(c) Because Esec u E Ú 1 for all u for which the secant is defined, the statement 
sec u = 0.6 is impossible.
■✔ Now Try Exercises 53, 57, and 59.
The six trigonometric functions are defined in terms of x, y, and r, where the 
Pythagorean theorem shows that r2 = x2 + y2 and r 7 0. With these relation-

lies makes it possible to find the values of the other trigonometric functions.

 x2 + 4 = 9     
Apply exponents.
 x2 = 5     
Subtract 4.
x = 25 or x = - 25   
 Square root property: If x2 = k,  
then x = 2k or x = - 2k.
Similarly, dividing through by y2 leads to another identity.
1 + cot2 U = csc2 U
These three identities are the Pythagorean identities because the original equa-
tion that led to them, x2 + y2 = r2, comes from the Pythagorean theorem.

1.4 Using the Definitions of the Trigonometric Functions
Pythagorean Identities
For all angles u for which the function values are defined, the following 
identities hold.
sin2 U + cos2 U = 1  tan2 U + 1 = sec2 U  1 + cot2 U = csc2 U
We give only one form of each identity. However, algebraic transforma-
tions produce equivalent forms. For example, by subtracting sin2 u from both 
sides of sin2 u + cos2 u = 1, we obtain an equivalent identity.
cos2 u = 1 - sin2 u   Alternative form
It is important to be able to transform these identities quickly and also to rec-
ognize their equivalent forms.

quotient identities are used in calculus 
to find derivatives and integrals of

EXAMPLE 7 
Using Identities to Find Function Values
Find sin u and cos u, given that tan u = 4

SOLUTION Because u is in quadrant III, sin u and cos u will both be negative. 
It is tempting to say that since tan u = sin u
cos u and tan u = 4
3 , then sin u = -4 and 
cos u = -3. This is incorrect, however—both sin u and cos u must be in the 
interval 3 -1, 14.
We use the Pythagorean identity tan2 u + 1 = sec2 u to find sec u, and then 
the reciprocal identity cos u =

sec u to find cos u.

NOTE Example 7 can also be worked 
by sketching u in standard position in 
quadrant III, finding r to be 5, and then 
using the definitions of sin u and cos u in 
terms of x, y, and r. See Figure 37.
When using this method, be sure to 
choose the correct signs for x and y as 
determined by the quadrant in which the 
terminal side of u lies. This is analogous

 Angle Relationships and Similar Triangles

Vertical angles have equal measures.
When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the follow-
ing angles formed have equal measure:
r alternate interior angles,
r alternate exterior angles, and
r corresponding angles.
Interior angles on the same side of a transversal are 
supplementary.

Angle 2 has measure 12 # 12 - 24 = 120°.
Angle 3 has measure 4 # 12 + 12 = 60°.
Angle 1 is a vertical angle to angle 2, so its measure is 120°.
Angle 4 corresponds to angle 2, so its measure is 120°.
The measures of two angles of a triangle are 42° 20′ and 
35° 10′. Find the measure of the third angle, x.
 42° 20′ + 35° 10′ + x = 180°
      The sum of the 
angles is 180°.

 x = 102° 30′
 12x - 24 + 4x + 12 = 180

48. Angle through Which the Celestial North 
Pole Moves At present, the north star Polaris is 
located very near the celestial north pole. However, 
because Earth is inclined 23.5°, the moon’s gravi-
tational pull on Earth is uneven. As a result, Earth 
slowly precesses (moves in) like a spinning top, 
and the direction of the celestial north pole traces 
out a circular path once every 26,000 yr. See the 
figure. For example, in approximately A.D. 14,000 
the star Vega—not the star Polaris—will be located 
at the celestial north pole. As viewed from the  
center C of this circular path, calculate the angle 
(to the nearest second) through which the celestial 
north pole moves each year. (Source: Zeilik, M., S. Gregory, and E. Smith, Introduc-

CHAPTER 2 Acute Angles and Right Triangles
Right-Triangle-Based Definitions of the Trigonometric Functions
Angles in standard position can be used to define the trigonometric functions. 
There is also another way to approach them: as ratios of the lengths of the sides 
of right triangles.
Figure 1 shows an acute angle A in standard position. The definitions of 
the trigonometric function values of angle A require x, y, and r. As drawn in  
Figure 1, x and y are the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle ABC, and r 
is the length of the hypotenuse.
The side of length y is the side opposite angle A, and the side of length x is 
the side adjacent to angle A. We use the lengths of these sides to replace x and 
y in the definitions of the trigonometric functions, and the length of the hypot-
enuse to replace r, to obtain the following right-triangle-based definitions. In 
the definitions, we use the standard abbreviations for the sine, cosine, tangent, 
cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions.

Whenever we use A, B, and C to name 
angles in a right triangle, C will be the

NOTE The cosecant, secant, and cotangent ratios are reciprocals of the

 csc A = 25

Cofunctions  
Figure 3 shows a right triangle with acute angles A and B 
and a right angle at C. The length of the side opposite angle A is a, and the length 
of the side opposite angle B is b. The length of the hypotenuse is c. By the pre-
ceding definitions, sin A =
a
c . Also, cos B =
a
c . Thus, we have the following.
 sin  A = a
c = cos B
Similarly, tan  A = a
b = cot B and sec A = c
b = csc B.
In any right triangle, the sum of the two acute angles is 90°, so they are 
complementary. In Figure 3, A and B are thus complementary, and we have 
established that sin A = cos B. This can also be written as follows.
sin A = cos190° - A2 
B = 90° - A

How Function Values Change as Angles Change 
 
Figure 4 shows  
three right triangles. From left to right, the length of each hypotenuse is the 
same, but angle A increases in measure. As angle A increases in measure from 
0° to 90°, the length of the side opposite angle A also increases.
EXAMPLE 3 
Solving Equations Using Cofunction Identities
Find one solution for each equation. Assume all angles involved are acute angles.
(a) cos1u + 4°2 = sin13u + 2°2 
(b) tan12u - 18°2 = cot1u + 18°2
SOLUTION
(a) Sine and cosine are cofunctions, so cos1u + 4°2 = sin13u + 2°2 is true if 
the sum of the angles is 90°.
  1u + 4°2 + 13u + 2°2 = 90° 
Complementary angles
 4u + 6° = 90° 
Combine like terms.
 4u = 84° 
Subtract 6° from each side.
 
 u = 21° 
Divide by 4.
(b) Tangent and cotangent are cofunctions.
 12u - 18°2 + 1u + 18°2 = 90° 
Complementary angles
 3u = 90° 
Combine like terms.
 u = 30° 
Divide by 3.
■✔ Now Try Exercises 31 and 33.
In the ratio
 sin A = side opposite
hypotenuse = y
r
 ,
as angle A increases, the numerator of this fraction also increases, while the 
denominator is fixed. Therefore, sin A increases as A increases from 0° to 90°.
As angle A increases from 0° to 90°, the length of the side adjacent to A 
decreases. Because r is fixed, the ratio x
r decreases. This ratio gives cos A, showing 
that the values of cosine decrease as the angle measure changes from 0° to 90°. 
Finally, increasing A from 0° to 90° causes y to increase and x to decrease, making 
the values of  
y
x = tan A increase.
A similar discussion shows that as A increases from 0° to 90°, the values of 
sec A increase, while the values of cot A and csc A decrease.

2.1 Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles
Trigonometric Function Values of Special Angles 
 Certain special  
angles, such as 30°, 45°, and 60°, occur so often in trigonometry and in more  
advanced mathematics that they deserve special study. We start with an equilateral 
triangle, a triangle with all sides of equal length. Each angle of such a triangle 
measures 60°. Although the results we will obtain are independent of the length, 
for convenience we choose the length of each side to be 2 units. See Figure 5(a).
Bisecting one angle of this equilateral triangle leads to two right triangles, 
each of which has angles of 30°, 60°, and 90°, as shown in Figure 5(b). An angle 
bisector of an equilateral triangle also bisects the opposite side. Thus the shorter 
leg has length 1. Let x represent the length of the longer leg.
 22 = 12 + x2 
Pythagorean theorem
 4 = 1 + x2  
Apply the exponents.
 3 = x2
 
Subtract 1 from each side.
 23 = x
 
 Square root property;  
choose the positive root.
Figure 6 summarizes our results using a 30°9 60° right triangle. As shown in the 
figure, the side opposite the 30° angle has length 1. For the 30° angle,
hypotenuse = 2, side opposite = 1, side adjacent = 23 .
Now we use the definitions of the trigonometric functions.
  sin 30° = side opposite
hypotenuse = 1

 cos 30° = side adjacent

Determine whether each statement is true or false.
(a) sin 21° 7 sin 18° 
(b) sec 56° … sec 49°
SOLUTION
(a) In the interval from 0° to 90°, as the angle increases, so does the sine of the 
angle. This makes sin 21° 7 sin 18° a true statement.
(b)  For fixed r, increasing an angle from 0° to 90° causes x to decrease. Therefore, 
sec u = r
x increases. The statement sec 56° … sec 49° is false.

CHAPTER 2 Acute Angles and Right Triangles
We find the values of the trigonometric functions for 45° by starting with 
a 45°9 45° right triangle, as shown in Figure 7. This triangle is isosceles. For 
simplicity, we choose the lengths of the equal sides to be 1 unit. (As before, the 
results are independent of the length of the equal sides.) If r represents the length 
of the hypotenuse, then we can find its value using the Pythagorean theorem.
 12 + 12 = r 2

 2 = r 2

 22 = r

2.1 Trigonometric Functions of Acute Angles
A calculator can find trigonometric function values at the touch of a key. 
So why do we spend so much time finding values for special angles? We do this 
because a calculator gives only approximate values in most cases instead of exact 
values. A scientific calculator gives the following approximation for tan 30°.
tan 30° ≈0.57735027 
≈means “is approximately equal to.”
Earlier, however, we found the exact value.
tan 30° = 23

Trigonometric Functions of Non-Acute Angles
Reference Angles 
 Associated with every nonquadrantal angle in stand-
ard position is an acute angle called its reference angle. A reference angle for an 
angle u, written u′, is the acute angle made by the terminal side of angle u and 
the x-axis.

Angles
Figure 10 shows several angles u (each less than one complete counterclock-
wise revolution) in quadrants II, III, and IV, respectively, with the reference angle 
u′ also shown. In quadrant I, u and u′ are the same. If an angle u is negative or has 
measure greater than 360°, its reference angle is found by first finding its cotermi-
nal angle that is between 0° and 360°, and then using the diagrams in Figure 10.
NOTE Reference angles are always positive and are between 0° and 90°.

57
2.2 Trigonometric Functions of Non-Acute Angles
CAUTION A common error is to find the reference angle by using the 
terminal side of u and the y-axis. The reference angle is always found with 
reference to the x-axis.
EXAMPLE 1 
Finding Reference Angles
Find the reference angle for each angle.
(a) 218°

SOLUTION
(a) As shown in Figure 11(a), the positive acute angle made by the terminal side 
of this angle and the x-axis is
 218° - 180° = 38°.
For u = 218°, the reference angle u′ = 38°.

obtain a quotient of about 3.9. Begin by subtracting 360° three times (because 
of the whole number 3 in 3.9).
1387° - 3 # 360°
= 1387° - 1080° 
Multiply.

The reference angle for 307° (and thus for 1387°) is 360° - 307° = 53°. See

 Finding Trigonometric Function Values of a  
Quadrant III Angle
Find exact values of the six trigonometric functions of 210°.
SOLUTION An angle of 210° is shown in Figure 12. The reference angle is
 210° - 180° = 30°.
To find the trigonometric function values of 210°, choose point P on the ter-
minal side of the angle so that the distance from the origin O to P is 2. (Any 
positive number would work, but 2 is most convenient.) By the results from 
30°9 60° right triangles, the coordinates of point P become A - 23 , -1B , with 
x = - 23 , y = -1, and r = 2. Then, by the definitions of the trigonometric 
functions, we obtain the following.
 sin 210° = -1

2.2 Trigonometric Functions of Non-Acute Angles
Notice in Example 2 that the trigonometric function values of 210° cor-
respond in absolute value to those of its reference angle 30°. The signs are 
different for the sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions because 210° is a 
quadrant III angle. These results suggest a shortcut for finding the trigonometric 
function values of a non-acute angle, using the reference angle.
In Example 2, the reference angle for 210° is 30°. Using the trigonometric 
function values of 30°, and choosing the correct signs for a quadrant III angle, 
we obtain the same results.
We determine the values of the trigonometric functions for any nonquadran-
tal angle u as follows. Keep in mind that all function values are positive when the 
terminal side is in Quadrant I, the sine and cosecant are positive in Quadrant II, 
the tangent and cotangent are positive in Quadrant III, and the cosine and secant 
are positive in Quadrant IV. In other cases, the function values are negative.
Finding Trigonometric Function Values for Any  
Nonquadrantal Angle U Step 1  If u 7 360°, or if u 6 0°, then find a coterminal angle by adding or 
subtracting 360° as many times as needed to obtain an angle greater 
than 0° but less than 360°.
Step 2 Find the reference angle u′.
Step 3 Find the trigonometric function values for reference angle u′.
Step 4  Determine the correct signs for the values found in Step 3. (Use 
the table of signs given earlier in the text or the paragraph above, if 
necessary.) This gives the values of the trigonometric functions for 
angle u.
NOTE To avoid sign errors when finding the trigonometric function val-
ues of an angle, sketch it in standard position. Include a reference triangle 
complete with appropriate values for x, y, and r as done in Figure 12.

2.2 Trigonometric Functions of Non-Acute Angles
Determination of Angle Measures with Special Reference Angles
The ideas discussed in this section can be used “in reverse” to find the measures 
of certain angles, given a trigonometric function value and an interval in which 
the angle must lie. We are most often interested in the interval 30°, 360°2.
EXAMPLE 6

a Function Value
Find all values of u, if u is in the interval 30°, 360°2 and cos u = -  22
2  .
SOLUTION The value of cos u is negative, so u may lie in either quadrant II or III. 
Because the absolute value of cos u is 22
2  , the reference angle u′ must be 45°. The 
two possible angles u are sketched in Figure 14.
 180° - 45° = 135°

Calculator Approximations of Trigonometric Function Values 
 We 
learned how to find exact function values for special angles and for angles having 
special reference angles earlier in this chapter. In this section we investigate how 
calculators provide approximations for function values of angles that do not sat-
isfy these conditions. (Of course, they can also be used to find exact values such 
as cos 1-240°2 and tan 675°, as seen in Figure 15.)

CAUTION It is important to remember that when we are evaluating trig-
onometric functions of angles given in degrees, the calculator must be in 
degree mode. An easy way to check this is to enter sin 90. If the displayed 
answer is 1, then the calculator is in degree mode.
Also remember that if the angle or the reference angle is not a special or 
quadrantal angle, then the value given by the calculator is an approximation. 
And even if the angle or reference angle is a special angle, the value given 
by the calculator will often be an approximation.
EXAMPLE 1 
Finding Function Values with a Calculator

(a) sin 49° 12′  (b) sec 97.977°  (c)

cot 51.4283°  (d) sin1-246°2
SOLUTION See Figure 16. We give values to eight decimal places below.
(a) We may begin by converting 49° 12′ to decimal degrees.
49° 12′ = 49 12
60
° = 49.2°
However, some calculators allow direct entry of degrees, minutes, and 
seconds. (The method of entry varies among models.) Entering either 
sin149° 12′2 or sin 49.2° gives the same approximation.
sin 49° 12′ = sin 49.2° ≈0.75699506
(b) There are no dedicated calculator keys for the secant, cosecant, and cotan-
gent functions. However, we can use reciprocal identities to evaluate them. 
Recall that sec u =
1
cos u for all angles u, where cos u ≠0. Therefore, we use 
the reciprocal of the cosine function to evaluate the secant function.

2.3 Approximations of Trigonometric Function Values
Calculator Approximations of Angle Measures 
 To find the measure 
of an angle having a certain trigonometric function value, calculators have three 
inverse functions (denoted sin−1 , cos−1 , and tan−1). If x is an appropriate num-
ber, then sin−1 x, cos−1 x, or tan−1 x gives the measure of an angle whose 
sine, cosine, or tangent, respectively, is x. For applications in this chapter, these 
functions will return angles in quadrant I.

EXAMPLE 3 
Finding Grade Resistance
When an automobile travels uphill or downhill on a highway, it experiences a force 
due to gravity. This force F in pounds is the grade resistance and is modeled by 
the equation
F = W sin u,
where u is the grade and W is the weight of the automobile. If the automo-
bile is moving uphill, then u 7 0°; if downhill, then u 6 0°. See Figure 18.

EXAMPLE 2 
Using Inverse Trigonometric Functions to Find Angles
Find an angle u in the interval 30°, 90°2 that satisfies each condition.
(a) sin u = 0.96770915 
(b) sec u = 1.0545829
SOLUTION
(a) Using degree mode and the inverse sine function, we find that an angle u having 
sine value 0.96770915 is 75.399995°. (There are infinitely many such angles, 
but the calculator gives only this one.)
u = sin-1 0.96770915 ≈75.399995°
See Figure 17.
(b) Use the identity cos u =
1
sec u . If sec u = 1.0545829 , then
cos u =
1
1.0545829
 .
Now, find u using the inverse cosine function. See Figure 17.

(b) Calculate F to the nearest 10 lb for a 5000-lb truck traveling a downhill grade 
with u = -6.1°.
(c) Calculate F for u = 0° and u = 90°. Do these answers agree with intuition?
SOLUTION
(a)  
 F = W sin u
 
Given model for grade resistance
 
 F = 2500 sin 2.5° 
Substitute given values.
 
 F ≈110 lb
 
Evaluate.
(b) F = W sin u = 5000 sin1-6.1°2 ≈-530 lb
F is negative because the truck is moving downhill.
(c) F = W sin u = W sin 0° = W102 = 0 lb
F = W sin u = W sin 90° = W112 = W lb
This agrees with intuition because if u = 0°, then there is level ground and 
gravity does not cause the vehicle to roll. If u were 90°, the road would be 
vertical and the full weight of the vehicle would be pulled downward by 
gravity, so F = W.

42. At one time, a certain make of calculator did not allow the input of angles outside

(c)  A stretch of highway has a 4-ft vertical rise for every 100 ft of horizontal run. 
Use an approximation from part (b) to estimate the grade resistance, to the near-
est pound, for a 2000-lb car on this stretch of highway.
(d)  Without evaluating a trigonometric function, estimate the grade resistance, to the 
nearest pound, for an 1800-lb car on a stretch of highway that has a 3.75° grade.
(Modeling) Design of Highway Curves When highway curves are designed, the outside 
of the curve is often slightly elevated or inclined above the inside of the curve. See the 
figure. This inclination is the superelevation. For safety reasons, it is important that both 
the curve’s radius and superelevation be correct for a given speed limit. If an automobile 
is traveling at velocity V (in feet per second), the safe radius R, in feet, for a curve with 
superelevation u is modeled by the formula
R =
V2
g1 ƒ + tan u2
 ,
where ƒ and g are constants. (Source: Mannering, F. and W. Kilareski, Principles of 
Highway Engineering and Traffic Analysis, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons.)

and ƒ = 0.14 , calculate R to the nearest foot. (Hint: 45 mph = 66 ft per sec)
78. Determine the radius of the curve, to the nearest foot, if the speed in Exercise 77 is

radius R = 1150 ft and a superelevation of u = 2.1°. What should the speed limit  
(in miles per hour) be for this curve?
(Modeling) Speed of Light When a light ray 
travels from one medium, such as air, to another 
medium, such as water or glass, the speed  
of the light changes, and the light ray is bent, or 
refracted, at the boundary between the two  
media. (This is why objects under water appear 
to be in a different position from where they  
really are.) It can be shown in physics that these 
changes are related by Snell’s law
c1
c2
= sin u1
sin u2
 ,
where c1 is the speed of light in the first medium, c2 is the speed of light in the second  
medium, and u1 and u2 are the angles shown in the figure. In Exercises 81 and 82,  
assume that c1 = 3 * 108 m per sec.
81. Find the speed of light in the second medium for each of the following.
(a) u1 = 46° , u2 = 31° 
(b) u1 = 39° , u2 = 28°
82. Find u2 for each of the following values of u1 and c2 . Round to the nearest degree.

(Modeling) Braking Distance If aerodynamic resistance is ignored, the braking dis-
tance D (in feet) for an automobile to change its velocity from V1 to V2 (feet per second) 
can be modeled using the following equation.
D =
1.051V12 - V222
64.41K1 + K2 + sin u2
K1 is a constant determined by the efficiency of the brakes and tires, K2 is a constant 
determined by the rolling resistance of the automobile, and u is the grade of the highway. 
(Source: Mannering, F. and W. Kilareski, Principles of Highway Engineering and Traffic 
Analysis, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons.)
85. Compute the number of feet, to the nearest unit, required to slow a car from 55 mph to 
30 mph while traveling uphill with a grade of u = 3.5°. Let K1 = 0.4 and K2 = 0.02. 
(Hint: Change miles per hour to feet per second.)
(Modeling) Fish’s View of the World The figure 
shows a fish’s view of the world above the surface 
of the water. (Source: Walker, J., “The Amateur 
Scientist,” Scientific American.) Suppose that a 
light ray comes from the horizon, enters the water, 
and strikes the fish’s eye.
83. Assume that this ray gives a value of 90° for 
angle u1 in the formula for Snell’s law. (In a 
practical situation, this angle would probably 
be a little less than 90°.) The speed of light in 
water is about 2.254 * 108 m per sec. Find 
angle u2 to the nearest tenth.
84. Refer to Exercise 83. Suppose an object is located at a true angle of 29.6° above the

88. An automobile is traveling at 90 mph on a highway with a downhill grade of 
u = -3.5°. The driver sees a stalled truck in the road 200 ft away and immediately 
applies the brakes. Assuming that a collision cannot be avoided, how fast (in miles 
per hour, to the nearest unit) is the car traveling when it hits the truck? (Use the 
same values for K1 and K2 as in Exercise 85.)
(Modeling) Measuring Speed by Radar Any offset  
between a stationary radar gun and a moving target  
creates a “cosine effect” that reduces the radar read-
ing by the cosine of the angle between the gun and the  
vehicle. That is, the radar speed reading is the product 
of the actual speed and the cosine of the angle. (Source: 
Fischetti, M., “Working Knowledge,” Scientific American.)

Auto A and Auto B shown in the figure.

(Modeling) Length of a Sag Curve When a highway goes downhill and then uphill, it  
has a sag curve. Sag curves are designed so that at night, headlights shine sufficiently 
far down the road to allow a safe stopping distance. See the figure. S and L are in feet.
L

The minimum length L of a sag curve is determined by the height h of the car’s head-
lights above the pavement, the downhill grade u1 6 0°, the uphill grade u2 7 0°, and 
the safe stopping distance S for a given speed limit. In addition, L is dependent on the 
vertical alignment of the headlights. Headlights are usually pointed upward at a slight  
angle a above the horizontal of the car. Using these quantities, for a 55 mph speed limit, 
L can be modeled by the formula
L =
1u2 - u12S2

where S 6 L. (Source: Mannering, F. and W. Kilareski, Principles of Highway Engineer-

Solutions and Applications of Right Triangles
Historical Background 
 The beginnings of trigonometry can be traced 
back to antiquity. Figure 19 shows the Babylonian tablet Plimpton 322, which 
provides a table of secant values. The Greek mathematicians Hipparchus and 
Claudius Ptolemy developed a table of chords, which gives values of sines of 
angles between 0° and 90° in increments of 15 minutes. Until the advent of scien-
tific calculators in the late 20th century, tables were used to find function values 
that we now obtain with the stroke of a key.
Applications of spherical trigonometry accompanied the study of astronomy 
for these ancient civilizations. Until the mid-20th century, spherical trigonometry 
was studied in undergraduate courses. See Figure 20.
An introduction to applications of the plane trigonometry studied in this text 
involves applying the ratios to sides of objects that take the shape of right triangles.

Significant Digits 
 A number that represents the result of counting, or a 
number that results from theoretical work and is not the result of measurement, is 
an exact number. There are 50 states in the United States. In this statement, 50 is 
an exact number.
Most values obtained for trigonometric applications are measured values 
that are not exact. Suppose we quickly measure a room as 15 ft by 18 ft. See 
Figure 21. To calculate the length of a diagonal of the room, we can use the 
Pythagorean theorem.
 d2 = 152 + 182  
Pythagorean theorem
 d2 = 549
 
Apply the exponents and add.
 d = 2549
 
 Square root property;  
Choose the positive root.
 d ≈23.430749
Should this answer be given as the length of the diagonal 
of the room? Of course not. The number 23.430749 con-
tains six decimal places, while the original data of 15 ft 
and 18 ft are accurate only to the nearest foot. In practice, 
the results of a calculation can be no more accurate than 
the least accurate number in the calculation. Thus, we 
should indicate that the diagonal of the 15-by-18-ft room 
is approximately 23 ft.

2.4 Solutions and Applications of Right Triangles
If a wall measured to the nearest foot is 18 ft long, this actually means that 
the wall has length between 17.5 ft and 18.5 ft. If the wall is measured more accu-
rately as 18.3 ft long, then its length is really between 18.25 ft and 18.35 ft. The 
results of physical measurement are only approximately accurate and depend on 
the precision of the measuring instrument as well as the aptness of the observer. 
The digits obtained by actual measurement are significant digits. The measure-
ment 18 ft is said to have two significant digits; 18.3 ft has three significant digits.
In the following numbers, the significant digits are identified in color.
408 21.5 18.00 6.700 0.0025 0.09810 7300
Notice the following.
r   18.00 has four significant digits. The zeros in this number represent mea-
sured digits accurate to the nearest hundredth.
r   The number 0.0025 has only two significant digits, 2 and 5, because the 
zeros here are used only to locate the decimal point.
r   The number 7300 causes some confusion because it is impossible to determine 
whether the zeros are measured values. The number 7300 may have two, three, 
or four significant digits. When presented with this situation, we assume that the 
zeros are not significant, unless the context of the problem indicates otherwise.
To determine the number of significant digits for answers in applications of 
angle measure, use the following table.
To perform calculations with measured numbers, start by identifying the 
number with the least number of significant digits. Round the final answer to the 
same number of significant digits as this number. Remember that the answer is 
no more accurate than the least accurate number in the calculation.

Solving Triangles 
 To solve a triangle means to find the measures of all 
the angles and sides of the triangle. As shown in Figure 22, we use a to represent 
the length of the side opposite angle A, b for the length of the side opposite angle B, 
and so on. In a right triangle, the letter c is reserved for the hypotenuse.

CHAPTER 2 Acute Angles and Right Triangles
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
The derivatives of the parametric 
equations x = ƒ1t2 and y = g1t2 often 
represent the rate of change of physical 
quantities, such as velocities. When x 
and y are related by an equation, the 
derivatives are related rates because a 
change in one causes a related change 
in the other. Determining these rates  
in calculus often requires solving a 
right triangle.
NOTE In Example 1, we could have found the measure of angle B first 
and then used the trigonometric function values of B to find the lengths of 
the unknown sides. A right triangle can usually be solved in several ways, 
each producing the correct answer. 
To maintain accuracy, always use given information as much as pos-
sible, and avoid rounding in intermediate steps.

EXAMPLE 1 
Solving a Right Triangle Given an Angle and a Side
Solve right triangle ABC, if A = 34° 30′ and c = 12.7 in.
SOLUTION To solve the triangle, find the measures of the remaining sides and  
angles. See Figure 23. To find the value of a, use a trigonometric function  
involving the known values of angle A and side c. Because the sine of angle A is 
given by the quotient of the side opposite A and the hypotenuse, use sin A.
 sin A = a
c
 
sin A =

 sin 34° 30′ =

A = 34° 30′, c = 12.7
 a = 12.7 sin 34° 30′
 
Multiply by 12.7 and rewrite.
 a = 12.7 sin 34.5°
 
Convert to decimal degrees.
 a ≈12.710.566406242 
Use a calculator.
 a ≈7.19 in.
 
Three significant digits
Assuming that 34° 30′ is given to the nearest ten minutes, we rounded the 
answer to three significant digits.
To find the value of b, we could substitute the value of a just calculated and 
the given value of c in the Pythagorean theorem. It is better, however, to use the 
information given in the problem rather than a result just calculated. If an error 
is made in finding a, then b also would be incorrect. And, rounding more than 
once may cause the result to be less accurate. To find b, use cos A.
 cos A = b

cos A =

A = 34° 30′, c = 12.7 
 b = 12.7 cos 34° 30′ 
Multiply by 12.7 and rewrite.
 b ≈10.5 in.
 
Three significant digits
Once b is found, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to verify the results.
All that remains to solve triangle ABC is to find the measure of angle B.
 A + B = 90°
 
A and B are complementary angles.
 34° 30′ + B = 90°
 
A = 34°  30′
 B = 89° 60′ - 34° 30′ 
Rewrite 90°. Subtract 34° 30′.
 B = 55° 30′
 
Subtract degrees and minutes separately.

33.32° = 33° + 0.32160′2
The measure of B is approximately
90° - 33° 19′ = 56° 41′. 
90° = 89° 60′
We now find b from the Pythagorean theorem.
 a2 + b2 = c2 
Pythagorean theorem
 29.432 + b2 = 53.582 
a = 29.43, c = 53.58 
 b2 = 53.582 - 29.432 
Subtract 29.432.
 b = 22004.6915
 
Simplify on the right; square root property
 b ≈44.77 cm
 
■✔ Now Try Exercise 35.
Choose the  
positive square root.
CAUTION Be careful when interpreting the angle of depression. Both 
the angle of elevation and the angle of depression are measured between 
the line of sight and a horizontal line.
Angles of Elevation or Depression 
 In applications of right triangles, the 
angle of elevation from point X to point Y (above X) is the acute angle formed 
by ray XY and a horizontal ray with endpoint at X. See Figure 25(a). The angle 
of depression from point X to point Y (below X) is the acute angle formed by ray 
XY and a horizontal ray with endpoint X. See Figure 25(b).

SOLUTION As shown in Figure 27, the angle of depression is measured from 
a horizontal line down to the base of the lighthouse. The angle of depression and 
angle B, in the right triangle shown, are alternate interior angles whose measures 
are equal. We use the tangent ratio to solve for angle B.

a square with sides about 700 ft long. The 
height of the pyramid is about 200 ft. Find the 
angle of elevation u of the edge indicated in

60. Cloud Ceiling The U.S. Weather Bureau defines a cloud ceiling as the altitude of 
the lowest clouds that cover more than half the sky. To determine a cloud ceiling, a 
powerful searchlight projects a circle of light vertically on the bottom of the cloud. 
An observer sights the circle of light in the crosshairs of a tube called a clinometer. 
A pendant hanging vertically from the tube and resting on a protractor gives the 
angle of elevation. Find the cloud ceiling if the searchlight is located 1000 ft from 
the observer and the angle of elevation is 30.0° as measured with a clinometer at 
eye-height 6 ft. (Assume three significant digits.)

61. Height of Mt. Everest The highest mountain peak in the world is Mt. Everest, 
located in the Himalayas. The height of this enormous mountain was determined 
in 1856 by surveyors using trigonometry long before it was first climbed in 1953. 
This difficult measurement had to be done from a great distance. At an altitude of 
14,545 ft on a different mountain, the straight-line distance to the peak of Mt. Everest  
is 27.0134 mi and its angle of elevation is u = 5.82°. (Source: Dunham, W., The 
Mathematical Universe, John Wiley and Sons.)

of Earth had to be taken into account. Would the curvature of Earth make the 
peak appear taller or shorter than it actually is?
62. Error in Measurement A degree may seem like a very small unit, but an error of 
one degree in measuring an angle may be very significant. For example, suppose a 
laser beam directed toward the visible center of the moon misses its assigned target 
by 30.0″. How far is it (in miles) from its assigned target? Take the distance from 
the surface of Earth to that of the moon to be 234,000 mi. (Source: A Sourcebook of

Historical Background 
 Johann Müller, known as Regiomontanus (see 
Figure 28), was a fifteenth-century German astronomer whose best known book 
is On Triangles of Every Kind. He used the recently-invented printing process of 
Gutenberg to promote his research. In his excellent book Trigonometric Delights *,  
Eli Maor writes:
Regiomontanus was the first publisher of mathematical and astronomi-
cal books for commercial use. In 1474 he printed his Ephemerides, tables 
listing the position of the sun, moon, and planets for each day from 1475 
to 1506. This work brought him great acclaim; Christopher Columbus had 
a copy of it on his fourth voyage to the New World and used it to predict 
the famous lunar eclipse of February 29, 1504. The hostile natives had for 
some time refused Columbus’s men food and water, and he warned them 
that God would punish them and take away the moon’s light. His admo-
nition was at first ridiculed, but when at the appointed hour the eclipse 
began, the terrified natives immediately repented and fell into submission.

When a single angle is given, it is understood that bearing is measured in a 
clockwise direction from due north.
Several sample bearings using Method 1 are shown in Figure 29.

 We now investigate navigation problems. Bearing refers to the 
direction of motion of an object, such as a ship or airplane, or the direction of a 
second object at a distance relative to the ship or airplane.
We introduce two methods of measuring bearing.
CAUTION A correctly labeled sketch is crucial when solving applica-
tions like those that follow. Some of the necessary information is often not 
directly stated in the problem and can be determined only from the sketch.

2.5 Further Applications of Right Triangles
EXAMPLE 1 
Solving a Problem Involving Bearing (Method 1)
Radar stations A and B are on an east-west line, 3.7 km apart. Station A detects a 
plane at C, on a bearing of 61°. Station B simultaneously detects the same plane, 
on a bearing of 331°. Find the distance from A to C.
SOLUTION Begin with a sketch showing the given information. See Figure 30. 
A line drawn due north is perpendicular to an east-west line, so right angles are 
formed at A and B. Angles CBA and CAB can be found as follows.
 ∠CBA = 331° - 270° = 61° and  ∠CAB = 90° - 61° = 29°
A right triangle is formed. The distance from A to C, denoted b in the figure, can 
be found using the cosine function for angle CAB.
 cos 29° = b

either east or west, from this line.

Solving a Problem Involving Bearing (Method 2)
A ship leaves port and sails on a bearing of N 47° E for 3.5 hr. It then turns and 
sails on a bearing of S 43° E for 4.0 hr. If the ship’s rate is 22 knots (nautical miles 
per hour), find the distance that the ship is from port.
SOLUTION Draw and label a sketch as in 
Figure 32. Choose a point C on a bearing of 
N 47° E from port at point A. Then choose a 
point B on a bearing of S 43° E from point C.  
Because north-south lines are parallel,  
angle ACD measures 47° by alternate inte-
rior angles. The measure of angle ACB is
47° + 43° = 90°,
making triangle ABC a right triangle.

CHAPTER 2 Acute Angles and Right Triangles
Use the formula relating distance, rate, and time to find the distances in  
Figure 32 from A to C and from C to B.
 b = 22 * 3.5 = 77 nautical mi 
Distance = rate * time
 a = 22 * 4.0 = 88 nautical mi
Now find c, the distance from port at point A to the ship at point B.
 a2 + b2 = c2
 
Pythagorean theorem
 882 + 772 = c2
 
a = 88, b = 77
 c = 2882 + 772
 
 
If a2 + b2 = c2 and c 7 0,  
then c = 2a2 + b2.
 c ≈120 nautical mi

EXAMPLE 4 
Solving a Problem Involving Angles of Elevation
Francisco needs to know the height of a tree. From a given point on the ground, 
he finds that the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is 36.7°. He then moves 
back 50 ft. From the second point, the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is 
22.2°. See Figure 34. Find the height of the tree to the nearest foot.

ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION
Figure 34 shows two unknowns: x, the distance from the center of the 
trunk of the tree to the point where the first observation was made, 
and h, the height of the tree. See Figure 35 in the Graphing Calculator 
Solution. Because nothing is given about the length of the hypotenuse 
of either triangle ABC or triangle BCD, we use a ratio that does not 
involve the hypotenuse — namely, the tangent.
In triangle ABC, tan 36.7° = h
x or h = x tan 36.7°.
In triangle BCD, tan 22.2° =
h
50 + x or h = 150 + x2 tan 22.2°.
Each expression equals h, so the expressions must be equal.
 x tan 36.7° = 150 + x2 tan 22.2°
 
 
Equate expressions for h.
 x tan 36.7° = 50 tan 22.2° + x tan 22.2°
 
 
Distributive property
 x tan 36.7° - x tan 22.2° = 50 tan 22.2°
 
 
Write the x-terms on one side.
 x1tan 36.7° - tan 22.2°2 = 50 tan 22.2°
 
 
Factor out x.
 x =
50 tan 22.2°
tan 36.7° - tan 22.2°
 
 
Divide by the coefficient of x.
We saw above that h = x tan 36.7°. Substitute for x.
h = a
50 tan 22.2°
tan 36.7° - tan 22.2° b tan 36.7°
Use a calculator.
tan 36.7° = 0.74537703 and tan 22.2° = 0.40809244
Thus,
tan 36.7° - tan 22.2° = 0.74537703 - 0.40809244 = 0.33728459
and 
h = a 5010.408092442
0.33728459
b  0.74537703 ≈45.
To the nearest foot, the height of the tree is 45 ft.
GRAPHING CALCULATOR SOLUTION*
In Figure 35, we have superimposed 
Figure 34 on coordinate axes with the 
origin at D. By definition, the tangent 
of the angle between the x-axis and the 
graph of a line with equation y = mx + b 
is the slope of the line, m. For line DB, 
m = tan 22.2°. Because b equals 0, the 
equation of line DB is
y1 = 1tan 22.2°2x.
The equation of line AB is
y2 = 1tan 36.7°2x + b.
Because b ≠0 here, we use the point 
A150, 02 and the point-slope form to find 
the equation.
 y2 - y0 = m1x - x02  Point-slope form
 y2 - 0 = m1x - 502 
x0 = 50, y0 = 0 
 y2 = tan 36.7°1x - 502 
Lines y1 and y2 are graphed in Figure 36. 
The y-coordinate of the point of intersec-
tion of the graphs gives the length of BC, 
or h. Thus, h ≈45 .

(a)  If R = 965 ft and u = 37°, find the distance d between P and Q.
(b)  Find an expression in terms of R and u for the distance between points M and N.
44. (Modeling) Stopping Distance on a 
Curve Refer to Exercise 43. When  
an automobile travels along a cir-
cular curve, objects like trees and 
buildings situated on the inside of 
the curve can obstruct the driver’s 
vision. These obstructions prevent 
the driver from seeing sufficiently far 
down the highway to ensure a safe
  stopping distance. In the figure, the minimum distance d that should be cleared on 
the inside of the highway is modeled by the equation
d = R a1 - cos u
2b .
(Source: Mannering, F. and W. Kilareski, Principles of Highway Engineering and 
Traffic Analysis, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons.)
(a)  It can be shown that if u is measured in degrees, then u ≈57.3S

(b)  Compute d to the nearest foot for a 65 mph speed limit given S = 485 ft and 
R = 600 ft.
(c)  How does the speed limit affect the amount of land that should be cleared on the 
inside of the curve?

CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure and the Unit Circle
 3.1 
Radian Measure
Radian Measure 
 We have seen that angles can be measured in degrees. 
In more theoretical work in mathematics, radian measure of angles is preferred. 
Radian measure enables us to treat the trigonometric functions as functions with 
domains of real numbers, rather than angles.
Figure 1 shows an angle u in standard position, along with a circle of  
radius r. The vertex of u is at the center of the circle. Because angle u intercepts 
an arc on the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, we say that angle u 
has a measure of 1 radian.

Radian
An angle with its vertex at the center of a circle that intercepts an arc on the 
circle equal in length to the radius of the circle has a measure of 1 radian.
It follows that an angle of measure 2 radians intercepts an arc equal in 
length to twice the radius of the circle, an angle of measure 1
2 radian intercepts 
an arc equal in length to half the radius of the circle, and so on. In general, if U 
is a central angle of a circle of radius r, and U intercepts an arc of length s, 
then the radian measure of U is s
r . See Figure 2.

The ratio s
r is a pure number, where s and r are expressed in the same units. 
Thus, “radians” is not a unit of measure like feet or centimeters.
Conversions between Degrees and Radians 
 The circumference of a 
circle—the distance around the circle—is given by C = 2pr, where r is the radius 
of the circle. The formula C = 2pr shows that the radius can be measured off 
2p times around a circle. Therefore, an angle of 360°, which corresponds to a 
complete circle, intercepts an arc equal in length to 2p times the radius of the 
circle. Thus, an angle of 360° has a measure of 2p radians.
360° = 2P radians
An angle of 180° is half the size of an angle of 360°, so an angle of 180° has 
half the radian measure of an angle of 360°.
180° = 1

3.1 Radian Measure
We can use the relationship 180° = p radians to develop a method for con-
verting between degrees and radians as follows.
180° = P radians  Degree/radian relationship
1° = P
180 radian  Divide by 180.  or  1 radian = 180°
P   Divide by p.

r Multiply a degree measure by p

r Multiply a radian measure by 180°
p  and simplify to convert to degrees.

CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure and the Unit Circle
One of the most important facts to remember when working with angles and 
their measures is summarized in the following statement.
NOTE Another way to convert a radian measure that is a rational multiple 
of p, such as 9p
4  , to degrees is to substitute 180° for p. In Example 2(a), 
doing this would give the following.

Agreement on Angle Measurement Units
If no unit of angle measure is specified, then the angle is understood to be 
measured in radians.
For example, Figure 3(a) shows an angle of 30°, and Figure 3(b) shows 
an angle of 30 (which means 30 radians). An angle with measure 30 radians 
is coterminal with an angle of approximately 279°.

LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
In calculus, radian measure is much 
easier to work with than degree mea-
sure. If x is measured in radians, then 
the derivative of ƒ1x2 = sin x is
ƒ′1x2 = cos x.
However, if x is measured in degrees, 
then the derivative of ƒ1x2 = sin x is
ƒ′1x2 =
p
180 cos x.
Trigonometric Function Values of Angles in Radians 
 Trigonometric 
function values for angles measured in radians can be found by first converting 
radian measure to degrees. (Try to skip this intermediate step as soon as possible, 
however, and find the function values directly from radian measure.)

 96. Railroad Engineering Some engineers use the term grade to represent 1

angle and express grade as a percent. For example, an angle of 0.9° would be referred 
to as a 1% grade. (Source: Hay, W., Railroad Engineering, John Wiley and Sons.)

convert it to radians?
(b)  In a rapid-transit rail system, the maximum grade allowed between two stations 
is 3.5%. Express this angle in degrees and in radians.
Arc Length on a Circle 
 The formula for finding the length of an arc of a 
circle follows directly from the definition of an angle u in radians, where u = s
r .
In Figure 5, we see that angle QOP has measure 1 radian and intercepts an arc 
of length r on the circle. We also see that angle ROT has measure u radians and 
intercepts an arc of length s on the circle. From plane geometry, we know that 
the lengths of the arcs are proportional to the measures of their central angles.
s
r = u

   Set up a proportion.
Multiplying each side by r gives
s = r u.   Solve for s.

107
3.2 Applications of Radian Measure
CAUTION When the formula s = r U is applied, the value of U MUST 
be expressed in radians, not degrees.
EXAMPLE 2 
Finding the Distance between Two Cities
Latitude gives the measure of a central angle with vertex at Earth’s center whose 
initial side goes through the equator and whose terminal side goes through  
the given location. Reno, Nevada, is approximately due north of Los Angeles. 
The latitude of Reno is 40° N, and that of Los Angeles is 34° N. (The N in 34° N 
means north of the equator.) The radius of Earth is 6400 km. Find the north-south 
distance between the two cities.
SOLUTION As shown in Figure 7, the central angle between Reno and Los 
Angeles is
40° - 34° = 6°.
The distance between the two cities can be found using the formula s = r u, after 
6° is converted to radians.
6° = 6 a p
180b = p

The distance between the two cities is given by s.

A rope is being wound around a drum with radius 0.8725 ft. (See Figure 8.) 
How much rope will be wound around the drum if the drum is rotated through

SOLUTION The length of rope wound around the drum is the arc length for a 
circle of radius 0.8725 ft and a central angle of 39.72°. Use the formula s = r u, 
with the angle converted to radian measure. The length of the rope wound

EXAMPLE 4 
Finding an Angle Measure Using s = r U
Two gears are adjusted so that the smaller gear drives the larger one, as shown 
in Figure 9. If the smaller gear rotates through an angle of 225°, through how 
many degrees will the larger gear rotate?
SOLUTION First find the radian measure of the angle of rotation for the 
smaller gear, and then find the arc length on the smaller gear. This arc length 
will correspond to the arc length of the motion of the larger gear. Because 
225° = 5p
4  radians, for the smaller gear we have arc length
s = r u = 2.5 a 5p
4 b = 12.5p
4
= 25p
8  cm.
The tips of the two mating gear teeth must move at the same linear speed, or 
the teeth will break. So we must have “equal arc lengths in equal times.” An arc 
with this length s on the larger gear corresponds to an angle measure u, in radians, 
where s = r u.
 s = r u

Area of a Sector of a Circle 
 A sector of a circle is the portion of the 
interior of a circle intercepted by a central angle. Think of it as a “piece of pie.” 
See Figure 10. A complete circle can be thought of as an angle with measure 
2p radians. If a central angle for a sector has measure u radians, then the sector 
makes up the fraction u
2p of a complete circle. The area 풜 of a complete circle

a sector-shaped field as shown in the figure. Find the area of the 
field if u = 40.0° and r = 152 yd.

and the radius length is doubled. How does the new area compare 
to the original area? Does this result hold in general for any values

angle of 95°. The shaded region in the figure 
is the portion of the windshield cleaned by

and rural lands adjacent to curves of highways and rail-
ways is that of finding the area when one or more of the 
boundary lines is the arc of a circle. Find the area (to two 
significant digits) of the lot shown in the figure. (Source: 
Anderson, J. and E. Michael, Introduction to Surveying, 
McGraw-Hill.)
 66. Nautical Miles Nautical miles are used 
by ships and airplanes. They are different 
from statute miles, where 1 mi = 5280 ft. 
A nautical mile is defined to be the arc 
length along the equator intercepted by a 
central angle AOB of  1′, as illustrated in 
the figure. If the equatorial radius of Earth 
is 3963 mi, use the arc length formula to 
approximate the number of statute miles in 
 1 nautical mile. Round the answer to two 
decimal places.
 67. Circumference of Earth The first accurate estimate of the distance around Earth 
was done by the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes (276–195 b.c.), who noted that the 
noontime position of the sun at the summer solstice in the city of Syene differed by 
7° 12′ from its noontime position in the city of Alexandria. (See the figure.) The dis-
tance between these two cities is 496 mi. Use the arc length formula to estimate the 
radius of Earth. Then find the circumference of Earth. (Source: Zeilik, M., Introductory

of the prime meridian, which goes from the North Pole to the South Pole through 
Greenwich, England. Arcs of 1° longitude are 110 km apart at the equator, and 
therefore 15° arcs subtend 15(110) km, or 1650 km, at the equator.

arc. See the figure. (Source: Tabakovic, H., J. Paullet, and R. Bertram, “Measuring

CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure and the Unit Circle
 3.3 
The Unit Circle and Circular Functions
We have defined the six trigonometric functions in such a way that the domain 
of each function was a set of angles in standard position. These angles can be 
measured in degrees or in radians. In advanced courses, such as calculus, it is 
necessary to modify the trigonometric functions so that their domains consist of 
real numbers rather than angles. We do this by using the relationship between 
an angle u and an arc of length s on a circle.

Circular Functions 
 In Figure 12, we start at the point 11, 02 and measure 
an arc of length s along the circle. If s 7 0, then the arc is measured in a counter-
clockwise direction, and if s 6 0, then the direction is clockwise. (If s = 0, then 
no arc is measured.) Let the endpoint of this arc be at the point 1x, y2. The circle 
in Figure 12 is the unit circle—it has center at the origin and radius 1 unit (hence 
the name unit circle). Recall from algebra that the equation of this circle is
x2 + y2 = 1.  The unit circle
The radian measure of u is related to the arc length s. For u measured in 
radians and for r and s measured in the same linear units, we know that
s = r u.
When the radius has measure 1 unit, the formula s = r u becomes s = u. Thus, 
the trigonometric functions of angle u in radians found by choosing a point 
1x, y2 on the unit circle can be rewritten as functions of the arc length s, a real 
number. When interpreted this way, they are called circular functions.

The unit circle is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the y-axis, and 
the origin. If a point 1a, b2 lies on the unit circle, so do 1a, -b2, 1-a, b2, and 
1-a, -b2. Furthermore, each of these points has a reference arc of equal mag-
nitude. For a point on the unit circle, its reference arc is the shortest arc from 
the point itself to the nearest point on the x-axis. (This concept is analogous to the 
reference angle concept.) Using the concept of symmetry makes determining 
sines and cosines of the real numbers identified in Figure 13* a relatively simple 
procedure if we know the coordinates of the points labeled in quadrant I.
*The authors thank Professor Marvel Townsend of the University of Florida for her suggestion to include 
Figure 13.
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
If you plan to study calculus, you 
must become very familiar with radian 
measure. In calculus, the trigonometric 
or circular functions are always under-
stood to have real number domains.

For example, the quadrant I real number p
3 is associated with the point

 R on the unit circle. Therefore, we can use symmetry to identify the coor-
dinates of points having p

NOTE Because cos s = x and sin s = y, we can replace x and y in the 
equation of the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 and obtain the following.
cos2 s + sin2 s = 1   Pythagorean identity
The ordered pair 1x, y2 represents a point on the unit circle, and therefore
-1  …     x     … 1 and 
-1  …    y    …  1,
−1 " cos s " 1 and −1 " sin s " 1.
For any value of s, both sin s and cos s exist, so the domain of these functions is 
the set of all real numbers.

118
CHAPTER 3 Radian Measure and the Unit Circle
For tan s, defined as y
x , x must not equal 0. The only way x can equal 0 is 
when the arc length s is p
2 , -  p
2 , 3p
2  , -  3p
2  , and so on. To avoid a 0 denominator, 
the domain of the tangent function must be restricted to those values of s that 
satisfy
s 3 12n + 12 P
2
 , where n is any integer.
The definition of secant also has x in the denominator, so the domain of secant 
is the same as the domain of tangent. Both cotangent and cosecant are defined 
with a denominator of y. To guarantee that y ≠0, the domain of these functions 
must be the set of all values of s that satisfy
s 3 nP, where n is any integer.
Domains of the Circular Functions
The domains of the circular functions are as follows.
Sine and Cosine Functions: 
1 −H, H2
Tangent and Secant Functions:
5s∣s 3 12n + 12  P
2
 , where n is any integer6
Cotangent and Cosecant Functions:
5s∣s 3 nP, where n is any integer6
Values of the Circular Functions 
 The circular functions of real numbers 
correspond to the trigonometric functions of angles measured in radians. Let 
us assume that angle u is in standard position, superimposed on the unit circle. 
See Figure 14. Suppose that u is the radian measure of this angle. Using the arc 
length formula
s = r u with r = 1, we have s = u.
Thus, the length of the intercepted arc is the real number that corresponds to the 
radian measure of u. We use the trigonometric function definitions to obtain 
the following.
sin u = y
r = y
1 = y = sin s, cos u = x
r = x
1 = x = cos s, and so on.
As shown here, the trigonometric functions and the circular functions lead to 
the same function values, provided that we think of the angles as being in radian 
measure. This leads to the following important result.

Evaluating a Circular Function
Circular function values of real numbers are obtained in the same manner 
as trigonometric function values of angles measured in radians. This applies 
both to methods of finding exact values (such as reference angle analysis) 
and to calculator approximations. Calculators must be in radian mode 
when they are used to find circular function values.

where u = 0 corresponds to sunrise and u =
p
2 occurs if the sun is directly over-
head. The Greek letter v (lowercase omega) is the number of radians that Earth 
has rotated through since noon, when v = 0. D is the declination of the sun, 
which varies because Earth is tilted on its axis. (Source: Winter, C., R. Sizmann, 
and L. L. Vant-Hull, Editors, Solar Power Plants, Springer-Verlag.)
Sacramento, California, has latitude L = 38.5°, or 0.6720 radian. Find the

D ≈-0.1425 and v ≈0.7854.
SOLUTION Use the given formula for sin u.
 sin u = cos D cos L cos v + sin D sin L
 sin u = cos1-0.14252 cos10.67202 cos10.78542 + sin1-0.14252 sin10.67202
 
 
Let D = -0.1425, L = 0.6720, and v = 0.7854.
 sin u ≈0.4593426188
 u ≈0.4773 radian, or 27.3° 
Use inverse sine.

Function Values as Lengths of Line Segments 
 The diagram shown in 
Figure 18 illustrates a correspondence that ties together the right triangle ratio 
definitions of the trigonometric functions and the unit circle interpretation. The 
arc SR is the first-quadrant portion of the unit circle, and the standard-position 
angle POQ is designated u. By definition, the coordinates of P are 1cos u, sin u2. 
The six trigonometric functions of u can be interpreted as lengths of line seg-
ments found in Figure 18.
For cos u and sin u, use right triangle POQ and right triangle ratios.

3.4 Linear and Angular Speed

Linear and Angular Speed
Linear Speed 
 There are situations when we need to know how fast a 
point on a circular disk is moving or how fast the central angle of such a disk is 
changing. Some examples occur with machinery involving gears or pulleys or 
the speed of a car around a curved portion of highway.
Suppose that point P moves at a constant speed along a circle of radius r and 
center O. See Figure 20. The measure of how fast the position of P is changing 
is the linear speed. If v represents linear speed, then
speed = distance
time
 , or v = s
t
 ,
where s is the length of the arc traced by point P at time t. (This formula is just a 
restatement of r = d
t with s as distance, v as rate (speed), and t as time.)

Angular Speed 
 Refer to Figure 20. As point P in the figure moves along 
the circle, ray OP rotates around the origin. Because ray OP is the terminal side 
of angle POB, the measure of the angle changes as P moves along the circle. The 
measure of how fast angle POB is changing is its angular speed. Angular speed, 
symbolized v, is given as
V = U
t
 , where U is in radians.
Here u is the measure of angle POB at time t. As with earlier formulas in this 
chapter, U must be measured in radians, with V expressed in radians per unit 
of time.
The length s of the arc intercepted on a circle of radius r by a central angle 
of measure u radians is s = r u. Using this formula, the formula for linear speed, 
v = s
t , can be written in several useful forms.
 v = s

 v = 70 ft per sec, or about 48 mph.   Use a calculator.
In a tennis serve the arm rotates at the shoulder, so the final speed of the racket is 
considerably greater. (Source: Cooper, J. and R. Glassow, Kinesiology, Second 
Edition, C.V. Mosby.)

(a) Find the angle generated by P in 6 sec.
(b) Find the distance traveled by P along the circle in 6 sec.

3.4 Linear and Angular Speed
SOLUTION
(a) The angular speed 80 revolutions per min can be converted to radians per 
second using the following facts.
1 revolution = 2p radians and 1 min = 60 sec
 
We multiply by the corresponding unit fractions. Here, just as with the unit 
circle, the word unit means 1, so multiplying by a unit fraction is equivalent 
to multiplying by 1. We divide out common units in the same way that we 
divide out common factors.
 v = 80 revolutions

# 2p radians
1 revolution # 1 min

 v = 160p radians

  Multiply. Divide out common units.
 v = 8p

(b) The linear speed v of the belt will be the same as that of a point on the cir-
cumference of the pulley.
v = rv = 6 a 8p

■✔ Now Try Exercise 47.
EXAMPLE 3 
 Finding Linear Speed and Distance Traveled  
by a Satellite
A satellite traveling in a circular orbit 1600 km above the surface of Earth takes 2 hr 
to make an orbit. The radius of Earth is approximately 6400 km. See Figure 22.
(a) Approximate the linear speed of the satellite in kilometers per hour.
(b) Approximate the distance the satellite travels in 4.5 hr.
SOLUTION
(a) The distance of the satellite from the center of Earth is approximately
r = 1600 + 6400 = 8000 km.
 
The angular speed 1 orbit per 2 hr can be converted to radians per hour using 
the fact that 1 orbit = 2p radians.
v = 1 orbit

(b) To approximate the distance traveled by the satellite, we use s = vt.

Periodic Function
A periodic function is a function ƒ such that
ƒ1x2 = ƒ1x + np2,
for every real number x in the domain of ƒ, every integer n, and some posi-
tive real number p. The least possible positive value of p is the period of the 
function.
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
Periodic functions are used throughout 
calculus, so it is important to know 
their characteristics. One use of 
these functions is to describe the 
location of a point in the plane using 
polar coordinates, an alternative to 
rectangular coordinates.
The circumference of the unit circle is 2p, so the least value of p for which 
the sine and cosine functions repeat is 2p. Therefore, the sine and cosine func-
tions are periodic functions with period 2P. For every positive integer n,
sin x = sin1x + n # 2P2 and cos x = cos1x + n # 2P2.

To avoid confusion when graphing the sine function, we use x rather than s. 
This corresponds to the letters in the xy-coordinate system. Selecting key values 
of x and finding the corresponding values of sin x leads to the table in Figure 3.

4.1 Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions
To obtain the traditional graph in Figure 3, we plot the points from the table, 
use symmetry, and join them with a smooth curve. Because y = sin x is periodic 
with period 2p and has domain 1-∞, ∞2, the graph continues in the same pat-
tern in both directions. This graph is a sine wave, or sinusoid.
The sine function is related to the unit circle. Its domain consists of real 
numbers corresponding to angle measures (or arc lengths) on the unit circle.  
Its range corresponds to y-coordinates (or sine values) on the unit circle.
Consider the unit circle in Figure 2 and assume that the line from the origin 
to some point on the circle is part of the pedal of a bicycle, with a foot placed 
on the circle itself. As the pedal is rotated from 0 radians on the horizontal axis 
through various angles, the angle (or arc length) giving the pedal’s location and 
its corresponding height from the horizontal axis given by sin x are used to cre-
ate points on the sine graph. See Figure 4 on the next page.
NOTE A function ƒ is an odd function if for all x in the domain of ƒ, 
ƒ1 −x2 = −ƒ1x2.
The graph of an odd function is symmetric with respect to the origin. This 
means that if 1x, y2 belongs to the function, then 1-x, -y2 also belongs to 
the function. For example, Ap
2 , 1B and A -  p
2 , -1B are points on the graph of 
y = sin x, illustrating the property sin1-x2 = -sin x.

CHAPTER 4 Graphs of the Circular Functions
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
The discussion of the derivative of a 
function in calculus shows that for the 
sine function, the slope of the tangent 
line at any point x is given by cos x.  
For example, look at the graph of 
y = sin x and notice that a tangent line 
at x = {
p
2  , {3p
2  , {5p
2  , . . . will be 
horizontal and thus have slope 0. Now 
look at the graph of y = cos x and see 
that for these values, cos x = 0.

NOTE A function ƒ is an even function if for all x in the domain of ƒ,
ƒ1 −x2 = ƒ1x2.
The graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. This 
means that if 1x, y2 belongs to the function, then 1-x, y2 also belongs to 
the function. For example, Ap
2 , 0B and A -  p
2 , 0B are points on the graph of 
y = cos x, illustrating the property cos1-x2 = cos x.
Graph of the Cosine Function

The amplitude of a periodic function is half the difference between the 
maximum and minimum values. It describes the height of the graph both above 
and below a horizontal line passing through the “middle” of the graph. Thus,  
for the basic sine function y = sin x (and also for the basic cosine function 
y = cos x), the amplitude is computed as follows.

 31 - 1-124 = 1

Amplitude of y = sin x
For y = 2 sin x, the amplitude is

2
 32 - 1-224 = 1

 142 = 2. 
Amplitude of y = 2 sin x
We can think of the graph of y = a sin x as a vertical stretching of the 
graph of y = sin x when a + 1 and a vertical shrinking when 0 * a * 1.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 15.
Amplitude
The graph of y = a sin x or y = a cos x, with a ≠0, will have the same 
shape as the graph of y = sin x or y = cos x, respectively, except with range 
3 - 'a', 'a'4. The amplitude is 'a'.
Techniques for Graphing, Amplitude, and Period  The examples that 
follow show graphs that are “stretched” or “compressed” (shrunk) either vertically,  
horizontally, or both when compared with the graphs of y = sin x or y = cos x.

144
CHAPTER 4 Graphs of the Circular Functions
While the coefficient a in y = a sin x or y = a cos x affects the amplitude 
of the graph, the coefficient of x in the argument affects the period. Consider 
y = sin 2x. We can complete a table of values for the interval 30, 2p4.
NOTE One method to divide an interval into four equal parts is as follows.
Step 1  Find the midpoint of the interval by adding the x-values of the end-
points and dividing by 2.
Step 2  Find the quarter points (the midpoints of the two intervals found in 
Step 1) using the same procedure.
EXAMPLE 2 
Graphing y = sin bx
Graph y = sin 2x, and compare to the graph of y = sin x.
SOLUTION In this function the coefficient of x is 2, so b = 2 and the period is 
2p
2 = p. Therefore, the graph will complete one period over the interval 30, p4.
We can divide the interval 30, p4 into four equal parts by first finding its 
midpoint: 1
2 10 + p2 = p
2 . The quarter points are found next by determining the 
midpoints of the two intervals C 0, p
2 D and C p
2 , pD.

These values suggest that one complete cycle is achieved in p

is reasonable because

2 b = sin 2p = 0.
In general, the graph of a function of the form y = sin bx or y = cos bx, 
for b + 0, will have a period different from 2P when b 3 1. 
To see why this is so, remember that the values of sin bx or cos bx will take on 
all possible values as bx ranges from 0 to 2p. Therefore, to find the period of 
either of these functions, we must solve the following three-part inequality.
 0 … bx … 2p 
bx ranges from 0 to 2p.
 0 …    x   … 2p
b
 
 Divide each part by the  
positive number b.
Thus, the period is 2P
b  . By dividing the interval C 0, 2p
b D into four equal parts, we 
obtain the values for which sin bx or cos bx is -1, 0, or 1. These values will give 
minimum points, x-intercepts, and maximum points on the graph. (If a function 
has b 6 0, then identities can be used to rewrite the function so that b 7 0.)

We can think of the graph of y = sin bx as a horizontal stretching of the

■✔ Now Try Exercise 27.
Period
For b 7 0, the graph of y = sin bx will resemble that of y = sin x, but with 
period 2p
b  . Also, the graph of y = cos bx will resemble that of y = cos x, but 
with period 2p

b D 
into four equal parts gives the values 0, p
2 , p, 3p
2  , and 2p for this row, result-
ing here in values of -1, 0, or 1. These values lead to key points on the graph, 
which can be plotted and joined with a smooth sinusoidal curve.
Guidelines for Sketching Graphs of Sine and Cosine Functions
To graph y = a sin bx or y = a cos bx, with b 7 0, follow these steps.
Step 1  Find the period, 2p
b  . Start at 0 on the x-axis, and lay off a distance of  2p
b  .
Step 2  Divide the interval into four equal parts. (See the Note preceding 
Example 2.)
Step 3  Evaluate the function for each of the five x-values resulting from 
Step 2. The points will be maximum points, minimum points, and 
x-intercepts.
Step 4  Plot the points found in Step 3, and join them with a sinusoidal curve 
having amplitude 'a'.
Step 5 Draw the graph over additional periods as needed.
EXAMPLE 4 
Graphing y = a sin bx
Graph y = -2 sin 3x over one period using the preceding guidelines.
SOLUTION
Step 1  For this function, b = 3, so the period is 2p
3  . The function will be graphed 
over the interval C 0, 2p
3 D.
Step 2 Divide the interval C 0, 2p
3 D into four equal parts to obtain the x-values 
0, p
6 , p
3 , p
2 , and 2p
3  .

Step 5 The graph can be extended by repeating the cycle.
Notice that when a is negative, the graph of y = a sin bx is a reflection 
across the x-axis of the graph of y = ∣a ∣ sin bx.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 29.

CHAPTER 4 Graphs of the Circular Functions
A Trigonometric Model  Sine and cosine functions may be used to model 
many real-life phenomena that repeat their values in a cyclical, or peri odic, 
manner. Average temperature in a certain geographic location is one such example.

the function

 1x - 4.32 d,
where x is the month and x = 1 corresponds to January, x = 2 to February, and 
so on.

by 3 -45, 454.
(b) According to this model, what is the average temperature during the month 
of May?
(c) What would be an approximation for the average annual temperature at 
Mould Bay?

47. Average Annual Temperature Scientists believe that the average annual tempera-
ture in a given location is periodic. The average temperature at a given place dur-
ing a given season fluctuates as time goes on, from colder to warmer, and back 
to colder. The graph shows an idealized description of the temperature (in °F) for 
approximately the last 150 thousand years of a particular location.
(a)  Find the highest and lowest temperatures recorded.
(b)  Use these two numbers to find the amplitude.
(c)  Find the period of the function.
(d)  What is the trend of the temperature now?
48. Blood Pressure Variation The  
graph gives the variation in 
blood pressure for a typical 
person. Systolic and diastolic 
pressures are the upper and 
lower limits of the periodic 
changes in pressure that pro-
duce the pulse. The length 
of time between peaks is the 
period of the pulse.
(a)  Find the systolic and diastolic pressures.
(b)  Find the amplitude of the graph.
(c)  Find the pulse rate (the number of pulse beats in 1 min) for this person.

58. Fluctuation in the Solar Constant The solar constant S is the amount of energy 
per unit area that reaches Earth’s atmosphere from the sun. It is equal to 1367 watts

calculated using the formula

In this formula, N is the day number covering a four-year period, where N = 1 cor-
responds to January 1 of a leap year and N = 1461 corresponds to December 31 of 
the fourth year. (Source: Winter, C., R. Sizmann, and L. L.Vant-Hull, Editors, Solar

Horizontal Translations 
 The graph of the function
y = ƒ1x −d2
is translated horizontally compared to the 
graph of y = ƒ1x2. The translation is d units 
to the right if d 7 0 and 'd ' units to the left 
if d 6 0. See Figure 12.
With circular functions, a horizontal 
translation is a phase shift. In the function 
y = ƒ1x - d2, the expression x - d is the 
argument.

CHAPTER 4 Graphs of the Circular Functions
EXAMPLE 1 
Graphing y = sin  1x −d2
Graph y = sin Ax - p
3 B over one period.
SOLUTION Method 1 For the argument x - p
3 to result in all possible values 
throughout one period, it must take on all values between 0 and 2p, inclusive. 
To find an interval of one period, we solve the following three-part inequality.
 0 … x - p
3 … 2p 
Three-part inequality

3 …    x

Add p

Use the method described in the previous section to divide the interval C p

into four equal parts, obtaining the following x-values.
These are key 
x-values.

We join the corresponding points with a smooth curve to obtain the solid blue 
graph shown in Figure 13. The period is 2p, and the amplitude is 1.
CAUTION In Example 1, the argument of the function is Ax - p
3 B. The 
parentheses are important here. If the function had been
y = sin x - p
3
 ,
the graph would be that of y = sin x translated vertically p
3 units down.
The graph can be extended through  
additional periods by repeating the given 
portion of the graph, as necessary.

Method 2 We can also graph y = sin Ax - p
3 B by using a horizontal trans-
lation of the graph of y = sin x. The argument x - p
3 indicates that the graph 
will be translated p
3 units to the right (the phase shift) compared to the graph of 
y = sin x. See Figure 13.
To graph a function using this method, first graph the basic circular func-
tion, and then graph the desired function using the appropriate translation.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 39.

155
4.2 Translations of the Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions
We join the corresponding points with a smooth curve to obtain the solid blue 
graph shown in Figure 14. The period is 2p, and the amplitude is 3.
Method 2 Write y = 3 cos Ax + p
4 B in the form y = a cos1x - d2.
y = 3 cos ax + p
4 b  , or y = 3 cos cx - a -  p
4 b d 
Rewrite to subtract - p
4  .
This result shows that d = -  p
4 . Because -  p
4 is negative, the phase shift is 
0 -  p
4 0 = p
4 unit to the left. The graph is the same as that of y = 3 cos x (the red 
graph in the calculator screen shown in the margin), except that it is translated  
p
4 unit to the left (the blue graph). 
■✔ Now Try Exercise 41.
EXAMPLE 2 
Graphing y = a cos 1x −d2
Graph y = 3 cos Ax + p
4 B over one period.

EXAMPLE 3 
Graphing y = a cos  3b 1x −d2 4
Graph y = -2 cos13x + p2 over two periods.
SOLUTION Method 1 We first solve the three-part inequality
0 … 3x + p … 2p
to find the interval C -  p
3 , p
3 D. Dividing this interval into four equal parts gives 
the points A -  p
3 , -2B , A -  p
6 , 0B , 10, 22, Ap
6 , 0B , and Ap
3 , -2B . We plot these 
points and join them with a smooth curve. By graphing an additional half period 
to the left and to the right, we obtain the graph shown in Figure 15.
Method 2 First write the equation in the form y = a cos  3b1x - d24.
y = -2 cos13x + p2, or y = -2 cos  c3 ax + p
3 b d   Rewrite by  
factoring out 3.
Then a = -2, b = 3, and d = -  p
3 . The amplitude is $ -2 $ = 2, and the period 
is 2p
3  (because the value of b is 3). The phase shift is 0 -  p
3 0 = p
3 units to the left 
compared to the graph of y = -2 cos 3x. Again, see Figure 15.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 47.

CHAPTER 4 Graphs of the Circular Functions
Vertical Translations  The graph of a function of the form
y = c + ƒ1x2
is translated vertically compared to the graph of y = ƒ1x2. See Figure 16. The 
translation is c units up if c 7 0 and is 'c ' units down if c 6 0.

EXAMPLE 4 
Graphing y = c + a cos bx
Graph y = 3 - 2 cos 3x over two periods.
SOLUTION We use Method 1. The values of y will be 3 greater than the cor-
responding values of y in y = -2 cos 3x. This means that the graph of 
y = 3 - 2 cos 3x is the same as the graph of y = -2 cos 3x, vertically translated  
3 units up. The period of y = -2 cos 3x is 2p
3  , so the key points have these x-values.

■✔ Now Try Exercise 51.
CAUTION If we use Method 2 to graph the function y = 3 - 2 cos 3x in 
Example 4, we must first graph
y = -2 cos 3x
and then apply the vertical translation 3 units up. To begin, use the fact that 
a = -2 and b = 3 to determine that the amplitude is 2, the period is 2p
3 , and 
the graph is the reflection of the graph of y = 2 cos 3x across the x-axis. 
Then, because c = 3, translate the graph of y = -2 cos 3x up 3 units. See 
Figure 17.
If the vertical translation is applied first, then the reflection must be 
across the line y = 3, not across the x-axis.

4.2 Translations of the Graphs of the Sine and Cosine Functions
Combinations of Translations  
Further Guidelines for Sketching Graphs of Sine and  
Cosine Functions
To graph y = c + a sin 3b1x −d2 4 or y = c + a cos 3b1x −d2 4  , with b 7 0, 
follow these steps.
Method 1
Step 1  Find an interval whose length is one period 2p
b  by solving the three-
part inequality 0 … b1x - d2 … 2p.
Step 2 Divide the interval into four equal parts to obtain five key x-values.
Step 3  Evaluate the function for each of the five x-values resulting from 
Step 2. The points will be maximum points, minimum points, and 
points that intersect the line y = c (“middle” points of the wave).
Step 4  Plot the points found in Step 3, and join them with a sinusoidal curve 
having amplitude 'a'.
Step 5 Draw the graph over additional periods, as needed.
Method 2
Step 1  Graph y = a sin bx or y = a cos bx. The amplitude of the function is 
'a', and the period is 2p
b  .
Step 2  Use translations to graph the desired function. The vertical transla-
tion is c units up if c 7 0 and 'c ' units down if c 6 0. The horizontal 
translation (phase shift) is d units to the right if d 7 0 and 'd ' units 
to the left if d 6 0.
 
 
EXAMPLE 5 
Graphing y = c + a sin  3b  1x −d2 4
Graph y = -1 + 2 sin14x + p2 over two periods.
SOLUTION We use Method 1. We must first write the expression on the right 
side of the equation in the form c + a sin  3b1x - d24.
y = -1 + 2 sin14x + p2, or y = -1 + 2 sin  c4 ax + p

The coldest month is January, when x = 1, and the hottest month is July, 
when x = 7. A good choice for d is 4 because April, when x = 4, is located  
at the midpoint between January and July. Also, notice that the average 
monthly temperature in April is 68°F, which is the value of the vertical 
translation, c. The average monthly temperature in New Orleans is modeled 
closely by the following equation.

Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions
Graph of the Tangent Function 
 Consider the table of selected points 
accompanying the graph of the tangent function in Figure 22 on the next page. 
These points include special values between -  p
2 and p
2 . The tangent function 
is undefined for odd multiples of p
2 and, thus, has vertical asymptotes for such 
values. A vertical asymptote is a vertical line that the graph approaches but does 
not intersect. As the x-values get closer and closer to the line, the function values 
increase or decrease without bound. Furthermore, because
tan1-x2 = -tan x, 
Odd function
the graph of the tangent function is symmetric with respect to the origin.

4.3 Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions
The tangent function has period p. Because tan x = sin x
cos x , tangent values are 
0 when sine values are 0, and are undefined when cosine values are 0. As x-values 
increase from -  p
2 to p
2 , tangent values range from -∞ to ∞ and increase through-
out the interval. Those same values are repeated as x increases from p
2 to 3p
2  , from 
3p
2  to 5p
2  , and so on. The graph of y = tan x from -  3p

4.3 Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions
Techniques for Graphing 
 
 
 
Guidelines for Sketching Graphs of Tangent and  
Cotangent Functions
To graph y = a tan bx or y = a cot bx, with b 7 0, follow these steps.
Step 1  Determine the period, p
b . To locate two adjacent vertical asymptotes, 
solve the following equations for x:
 
For y = a tan bx:  bx = -  p
2 and bx = p
2 .
 
For y = a cot bx:  bx = 0  and bx = p.
Step 2 Sketch the two vertical asymptotes found in Step 1.
Step 3  Divide the interval formed by the vertical asymptotes into four equal 
parts.
Step 4  Evaluate the function for the first-quarter point, midpoint, and third-
quarter point, using the x-values found in Step 3.
Step 5  Join the points with a smooth curve, approaching the vertical asymp-
totes. Indicate additional asymptotes and periods of the graph as  
necessary.
EXAMPLE 1 
Graphing y = tan bx
Graph y = tan 2x.
SOLUTION
Step 1  The period of this function is p
2 . To locate two adjacent vertical asymp-
totes, solve 2x = -  p
2 and 2x = p
2 (because this is a tangent function). The 
two asymptotes have equations x = -  p
4 and x = p
4 .
Step 2 Sketch the two vertical asymptotes x = {p
4 , as shown in Figure 28.
Step 3  Divide the interval A -  p
4 , p
4 B into four equal parts to find key x-values.
first-quarter value: -  p

 , middle value: 0, third-quarter value: p

Key x-values
Step 4 Evaluate the function for the x-values found in Step 3.

CHAPTER 4 Graphs of the Circular Functions
EXAMPLE 2 
Graphing y = a tan bx
Graph y = -3 tan 1
2 x.
SOLUTION The period is p
1
2
= p , 1
2 = p # 2
1 = 2p. Adjacent asymptotes are 
at x = -p and x = p. Dividing the interval 1-p, p2 into four equal parts gives  
key x-values of -  p
2 , 0, and p
2 . Evaluating the function at these x-values gives 
the following key points.
a -  p
2
 , 3b, 10, 02, a p
2
 , -3b 
Key points
By plotting these points and joining them with a smooth curve, we obtain the 
graph shown in Figure 29. Because the coefficient -3 is negative, the graph is 
reflected across the x-axis compared to the graph of y = 3 tan 1
2 x.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 21.

NOTE The function y = -3 tan 1
2 x in Example 2, graphed in Figure 29, 
has a graph that compares to the graph of y = tan x as follows.
1. The period is larger because b = 1
2 , and 1
2 6 1.
2. The graph is stretched vertically because a = -3, and ' -3' 7 1.
3.  Each branch of the graph falls from left to right (that is, the function  
decreases) between each pair of adjacent asymptotes because a = -3, 
and -3 6 0. When a 6 0, the graph is reflected across the x-axis com-
pared to the graph of y = 'a ' tan bx.
EXAMPLE 3 
Graphing y = a cot bx
Graph y = 1
2 cot 2x.
SOLUTION Because this function involves the cotangent, we can locate two 
adjacent asymptotes by solving the equations 2x = 0 and 2x = p. The lines 
x = 0 (the y-axis) and x = p
2 are two such asymptotes. We divide the interval 
A0, p
2 B into four equal parts, obtaining key x-values of p
8 , p

8  . Evaluating 
the function at these x-values gives the key points Ap

plot these points and join them with a smooth curve approaching the asymptotes

4.3 Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions
Like the other circular functions, the graphs of the tangent and cotangent 
functions may be translated horizontally and vertically.
EXAMPLE 4 
Graphing y = c + tan x
Graph y = 2 + tan x.
ANALYTIC SOLUTION
Every value of y for this function will be 2 units more 
than the corresponding value of y in y = tan x, causing 
the graph of y = 2 + tan x to be translated 2 units up 
compared to the graph of y = tan x. See Figure 31.
GRAPHING CALCULATOR SOLUTION
Observe Figures 32 and 33. In these figures
y2 = tan x 
is the red graph and
y1 = 2 + tan x
is the blue graph. Notice that for the arbitrarily-chosen 
value of p
4 1approximately 0.785398162, the difference 
in the y-values is
y1 - y2 = 3 - 1 = 2.
This illustrates the vertical translation 2 units up.

Three periods of the function are shown in Figure 31. 
Because the period of y = 2 + tan x is p, additional 
asymptotes and periods of the function can be drawn by 
repeating the basic graph every p units on the x-axis to 
the left or to the right of the graph shown.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 29.
EXAMPLE 5 
Graphing y = c + a cot1x −d2
Graph y = -2 - cot Ax - p
4 B .
SOLUTION Here b = 1, so the period is p. The negative sign in front of the 
cotangent will cause the graph to be reflected across the x-axis, and the argument  
Ax - p
4 B indicates a phase shift (horizontal shift) p
4 unit to the right. Because 
c = -2, the graph will then be translated 2 units down. To locate adjacent asymp-
totes, because this function involves the cotangent, we solve the following.
x - p
4 = 0   and x - p
4 = p
x = p
4  and   x = 5p
4  
Add p

Dividing the interval Ap

the three key x-values within the interval give these points.

(b) This is the graph of a cotangent function, but the period is

Therefore, the coefficient of x is 2. This graph is vertically translated 1 unit

y = -1 + cot 2  x.
Period is p

■✔ Now Try Exercises 39 and 43.
NOTE Because the circular functions are periodic, there are infinitely many 
equations that correspond to each graph in Example 6. Confirm that both
y = -1 - cot1-2x2 and y = -1 - tan a2x - p
2 b
are equations for the graph in Example 6(b). When writing the equation from 
a graph, it is practical to write the simplest form. Therefore, we choose values 
of b where b 7 0 and write the function without a phase shift when possible.

CHAPTER 4 Graphs of the Circular Functions
Because secant values are reciprocals of corresponding cosine values, the 
period of the secant function is 2p, the same as for y = cos x. When cos x = 1, 
the value of sec x is also 1. Likewise, when cos x = -1, sec x = -1. For all x, 
-1 … cos x … 1, and thus, 'sec x ' Ú 1 for all x in its domain. Figure 36 shows

4.4 Graphs of the Secant and Cosecant Functions
Graph of the Cosecant function 
 A similar analysis for selected points 
between -p and p for the graph of the cosecant function yields the graph in  
Figure  38. The vertical asymptotes are at x-values that are integer multiples of p.  
This graph is symmetric with respect to the origin because

Because cosecant values are reciprocals of corresponding sine values, the 
period of the cosecant function is 2p, the same as for y = sin x. When sin x = 1, 
the value of csc x is also 1. Likewise, when sin x = -1, csc x = -1. For all x, 
-1 … sin x … 1, and thus 'csc x ' Ú 1 for all x in its domain. Figure 39 shows

Guidelines for Sketching Graphs of Cosecant and Secant 
Functions
To graph y = a csc bx or y = a sec bx, with b 7 0, follow these steps.
Step 1  Graph the corresponding reciprocal function as a guide, using a 
dashed curve.
To Graph
Use as a Guide
y = a csc bx
y = a sin bx
y = a sec bx
y = a cos bx
Step 2  Sketch the vertical asymptotes. They will have equations of the form 
x = k, where k corresponds to an x-intercept of the graph of the 
guide function.
Step 3  Sketch the graph of the desired function by drawing the typical  
U-shaped branches between the adjacent asymptotes. The branches 
will be above the graph of the guide function when the guide function 
values are positive and below the graph of the guide function when the 
guide function values are negative. The graph will resemble those in 
Figures 37 and 40 in the function boxes given earlier in this section.
Like graphs of the sine and cosine functions, graphs of the secant and cose-
cant functions may be translated vertically and horizontally. The period of both 
basic functions is 2p.
EXAMPLE 1 
Graphing y = a sec bx
Graph y = 2 sec 1
2 x.
SOLUTION
Step 1 This function involves the secant, so the corresponding reciprocal func-
tion will involve the cosine. The guide function to graph is
y = 2 cos 1
2
 x.
 
 Using the guidelines given earlier, we find that this guide function has 
amplitude 2 and that one period of the graph lies along the interval that 
satisfies the following inequality.
 0 … 1
2
 x … 2p
 0 …   x   … 4p 
Multiply each part by 2.
Dividing the interval 30, 4p4 into four equal parts gives these key points.

Harmonic Motion
Simple Harmonic Motion 
 In part A of Figure 46, a spring with a weight 
attached to its free end is in equilibrium (or rest) position. If the weight is pulled 
down a units and released (part B of the figure), the spring’s elasticity causes the 
weight to rise a units 1a 7 02 above the equilibrium position, as seen in part C, 
and then to oscillate about the equilibrium position.

Simple Harmonic Motion
The position of a point oscillating about an equilibrium position at time t is 
modeled by either
s1t2 = a cos V t or s1t2 = a sin V t,
where a and v are constants, with v 7 0. The amplitude of the motion is 'a ', 
the period is 
2p
v  , and the frequency is v
2p oscillations per time unit.
EXAMPLE 1 
Modeling the Motion of a Spring
Suppose that an object is attached to a coiled spring such as the one in Figure 46 
on the preceding page. It is pulled down a distance of 5 in. from its equilibrium 
position and then released. The time for one complete oscillation is 4 sec.
(a) Give an equation that models the position of the object at time t.
(b) Determine the position at t = 1.5 sec.
(c) Find the frequency.
SOLUTION
(a) When the object is released at t = 0, the distance of the object from the equi-
librium position is 5 in. below equilibrium. If s1t2 is to model the motion, 
then s102 must equal -5. We use
s1t2 = a cos vt, with a = -5.
We choose the cosine function here because cos v102 = cos 0 = 1, and 
-5 # 1 = -5. (Had we chosen the sine function, a phase shift would have 
been required.) Use the fact that the period is 4 to solve for v.
 2p
v = 4  
The period is 2p
v  .
 v = p
2 
Solve for v.
Thus, the motion is modeled by s1t2 = -5 cos p
2 t.
 
To develop a general equation for such motion, consider Figure 47. Sup-
pose the point P1x, y2 moves around the circle counterclockwise at a uniform 
angular speed v. Assume that at time t = 0, P is at 1a, 02. The angle swept out 
by ray OP at time t is given by u = vt. The coordinates of point P at time t are
x = a cos u = a cos vt and y = a sin u = a sin vt.
As P moves around the circle from the point 1a, 02, the point Q10, y2 oscil-
lates back and forth along the y-axis between the points 10, a2 and 10, -a2.  
Similarly, the point R1x, 02 oscillates back and forth between 1a, 02 and 1-a, 02. 
This oscillatory motion is simple harmonic motion.
The amplitude of the motion is 'a ', and the period is 2p
v  . The moving points 
P and Q or P and R complete one oscillation or cycle per period. The number of 
cycles per unit of time, called the frequency, is the reciprocal of the period, 
v
2p , 
where v 7 0.

183

2
 11.52 d  
Let t = 1.5. 
 
 s11.52 ≈3.54 in.
 
Use a calculator.
Because 3.54 7 0, the object is above the equilibrium position.
(c) The frequency is the reciprocal of the period, or 1
4 oscillation per sec.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 7.
EXAMPLE 2 
Analyzing Harmonic Motion
Suppose that an object oscillates according to the model
s1t2 = 8 sin 3t,
where t is in seconds and s1t2 is in feet. Analyze the motion.
SOLUTION The motion is harmonic because the model is 
s1t2 = a sin vt. 
Because a = 8, the object oscillates 8 ft in either direction from its starting 
point. The period 2p
3 ≈2.1 is the time, in seconds, it takes for one complete  
oscillation. The frequency is the reciprocal of the period, so the object completes 
3
2p ≈0.48 oscillation per sec.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 17.
Damped Oscillatory Motion 
 In the example of the stretched spring, we 
disregard the effect of friction. Friction causes the amplitude of the motion to 
diminish gradually until the weight comes to rest. In this situation, we say that 
the motion has been damped by the force of friction. Most oscillatory motions 
are damped. For instance, shock absorbers are put on an automobile in order to 
damp oscillatory motion. Instead of oscillating up and down for a long while 
after hitting a bump or pothole, the oscillations of the car are quickly damped out 
for a smoother ride.
The decrease in amplitude of a damped oscillatory motion usually follows 
the pattern of exponential decay.
 
EXAMPLE 3 
Analyzing Damped Oscillatory Motion
A typical example of damped oscillatory motion is provided by the function
s1x2 = e-x cos 2px.
(The number e ≈2.718 is the base of the natural logarithm function.) We use x 
rather than t to match the variable for graphing calculators.
(a) Provide a calculator graph of y3 = e-x cos 2px, along with the graphs of 
y1 = e-x and y2 = -e-x for 0 … x … 3.

(d) For what values of x does the graph of y3 intersect the x-axis?
SOLUTION

(b) The graph of y3 is bounded above by the graph of y1 and below by the graph 
of y2. (The graphs of y1 and y2 are referred to as envelopes for the graph 
of y3.)
(c) When 2px = 0, 2p, 4p, and 6p, cos 2px = 1. Thus, the value of e-x cos 2px 
is the same as the value of e-x when 2px = 0, 2p, 4p, and 6p—that is,

CHAPTER 5 Trigonometric Identities

Fundamental Identities
Fundamental Identities 
 Recall that a  
function is even if ƒ1 −x2 = ƒ1x2 for all x 
in the domain of ƒ, and a function is odd if 
ƒ1 −x2 = −ƒ1x2 for all x in the domain of ƒ. 
We have used graphs to classify the trigono-
metric functions as even or odd. We can also use 
Figure 1 to do this.
As suggested by the circle in Figure 1, an 
angle u having the point 1x, y2 on its terminal 
side has a corresponding angle -u with the 
point 1x, -y2 on its terminal side.
From the definition of sine, we see that 
sin1-u2 and sin u are negatives of each other. 
That is,
sin1-u2 = -y
r  and sin u = y
r ,
so 
sin1−U2 = −sin U       Sine is an odd function.
This is an example of an identity, an equation that is satisfied by every value in 
the domain of its variable. Some examples from algebra follow.
 x2 - y2 = 1x + y21x - y2
 x1x + y2 = x2 + xy
   Identities
 x2 + 2xy + y2 = 1x + y22
Figure 1 shows an angle u in quadrant II, but the same result holds for u in 
any quadrant. The figure also suggests the following identity for cosine.
cos1-u2 = x
r and cos u = x
r
cos1−U2 = cos U        Cosine is an even function.
We use the identities for sin1-u2 and cos1-u2 to find tan1-u2 in terms of 
tan u.
tan1-u2 = sin1-u2
cos1-u2 = -sin u
cos u = -  sin u
cos u
tan1−U2 = −tan U      Tangent is an odd function.
The reciprocal identities are used to determine that cosecant and cotangent 
are odd functions and secant is an even function. These even-odd identities 
together with the reciprocal, quotient, and Pythagorean identities make up the 
fundamental identities.

For example, two other forms of sin2 U + cos2 U = 1 are
sin2 U = 1 −cos2 U and cos2 U = 1 −sin2 U.

 5.2 
Verifying Trigonometric Identities
Strategies 
 One of the skills required for more advanced work in math-
ematics, especially in calculus, is the ability to use identities to write expressions 
in alternative forms. We develop this skill by using the fundamental identities to 
verify that a trigonometric equation is an identity (for those values of the variable 
for which it is defined).
■ Strategies
■ Verifying Identities by 
Working with One Side
■ Verifying Identities 
by Working with Both 
Sides
CAUTION The procedure for verifying identities is not the same as that 
for solving equations. Techniques used in solving equations, such as add-
ing the same term to each side, and multiplying each side by the same term, 
should not be used when working with identities.
Work each problem.
79. Let cos x = 1
5 . Find all possible values of  sec x - tan x
sin x
 .
80. Let csc x = -3. Find all possible values of  sin x + cos x
sec x
 .

203
5.2 Verifying Trigonometric Identities
Verifying Identities by Working with One Side 
 Avoid the temptation 
to use algebraic properties of equations to verify identities.
One strategy is to work with one side and rewrite it to match the other side.
Hints for Verifying Identities
1. Learn the fundamental identities. Whenever you see either side of a 
fundamental identity, the other side should come to mind. Also, be aware 
of equivalent forms of the fundamental identities. For example,
sin2 u = 1 - cos2 u is an alternative form of sin2 u + cos2 u = 1.
2. Try to rewrite the more complicated side of the equation so that it is 
identical to the simpler side.
3. It is sometimes helpful to express all trigonometric functions in the 
equation in terms of sine and cosine and then simplify the result.
4. Usually, any factoring or indicated algebraic operations should be 
performed. These algebraic identities are often used in verifying trigo-
nometric identities.
 x2 + 2xy + y2 = 1x + y22
 x2 - 2xy + y2 = 1x - y22
 x3 - y3 = 1x - y21x2 + xy + y22
 x3 + y3 = 1x + y21x2 - xy + y22
 x2 - y2 = 1x + y21x - y2
 
For example, the expression
sin2 x + 2 sin x + 1 can be factored as 1sin x + 122.
 
The sum or difference of two trigonometric expressions can be found in 
the same way as any other rational expression. For example,
1
sin u +
1
cos u
   = 1 # cos u
sin u cos u +
1 # sin u
cos u sin u
   Write with the LCD.
   = cos u + sin u
sin u cos u
 .
   a
c + b
c = a + b
c
5. When selecting substitutions, keep in mind the side that is not changing, 
because it represents the goal. For example, to verify that the equation
tan2 x + 1 =
1
cos2 x
 
is an identity, think of an identity that relates tan x to cos x. In this case, 
because sec x =
1
cos x and sec2 x = tan2 x + 1, the secant function is the 
best link between the two sides.
6. If an expression contains 1 + sin x, multiplying both numerator and  
denominator by 1 - sin x would give 1 - sin2 x, which could be replaced  
with cos2 x. Similar procedures apply for 1 - sin x, 1 + cos x, and 
1 - cos x.
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
Trigonometric identities are used in 
calculus to simplify trigonometric 
expressions, determine derivatives of 
trigonometric functions, and change 
the form of some integrals.

Verifying an Identity (Working with One Side)

SOLUTION We use the fundamental identities to rewrite one side of the equa-

we work with it, as suggested in Hint 2, and use Hint 3 to change all functions to 
expressions involving sine or cosine.

Verifying Identities by Working with Both Sides 
 If both sides of an 
identity appear to be equally complex, the identity can be verified by working  
independently on the left side and on the right side, until each side is changed into 
some common third result. Each step, on each side, must be reversible. With all 
steps reversible, the procedure is as shown in the margin. The left side leads to a 
common third expression, which leads back to the right side.

CHAPTER 5 Trigonometric Identities
NOTE Working with both sides is often a good alternative for identities 
that are difficult. In practice, if working with one side does not seem to be 
effective, switch to the other side. Somewhere along the way it may happen 
that the same expression occurs on both sides.
EXAMPLE 5 
Verifying an Identity (Working with Both Sides)
Verify that the following equation is an identity.
sec a + tan a
sec a - tan a = 1 + 2 sin a + sin2 a
cos2 a
SOLUTION Both sides appear equally complex, so we verify the identity by 
changing each side into a common third expression. We work first on the left, 
multiplying the numerator and denominator by cos a.
 sec a + tan a

1sec a - tan a2 cos a

EXAMPLE 6 
Applying a Pythagorean Identity to Electronics
Tuners in radios select a radio station by adjusting the frequency. A tuner may 
contain an inductor L and a capacitor C, as illustrated in Figure 3. The energy 
stored in the inductor at time t is given by
 L1t2 = k sin2 2pFt
and the energy stored in the capacitor is given by
 C1t2 = k cos2 2pFt,
where F is the frequency of the radio station and k is a constant. The total energy 
E in the circuit is given by
 E1t2 = L1t2 + C1t2.
Show that E is a constant function. (Source: Weidner, R. and R. Sells, Elemen-
tary Classical Physics, Vol. 2, Allyn & Bacon.)
SOLUTION
 E1t2 = L1t2 + C1t2
    Given equation
 = k sin2 2pFt + k cos2 2pFt    Substitute.
 = k3sin2 2pFt + cos2 2pFt4     Factor out k.

    sin2 u + cos2 u = 1 1Here u = 2pFt.2

Sum and Difference Identities for Cosine
Difference Identity for Cosine 
 Several examples presented earlier should 
have convinced you by now that
cos1A −B2 does not equal cos A −cos B.
For example, if A = p
2 and B = 0, then
 
 cos1A - B2 = cos a p
2 - 0b = cos p
2 = 0,
while 
 cos A - cos B = cos p
2 - cos 0 = 0 - 1 = -1.
To derive a formula for cos1A - B2, we start by locating angles A and B in 
standard position on a unit circle, with B 6 A. Let S and Q be the points where 
the terminal sides of angles A and B, respectively, intersect the circle. Let P  
be the point 11, 02, and locate point R on the unit circle so that angle POR equals 
the difference A - B. See Figure 4.

Because point Q is on the unit circle, the x-coordinate of Q is the cosine of

Q has coordinates 1cos B, sin B2.

212
CHAPTER 5 Trigonometric Identities
In the same way,
 
S has coordinates 1cos A, sin A2,
and 
R has coordinates 1cos1A - B2, sin1A - B22.
Angle SOQ also equals A - B. The central angles SOQ and POR are equal, 
so chords PR and SQ are equal. Because PR = SQ, by the distance formula,
23cos1A - B2 - 142 + 3sin1A - B2 - 042       
d = 21x2 - x122 + 1y2 - y122
   = 21cos A - cos B22 + 1sin A - sin B22.
Square each side of this equation. Then square each expression, remembering 
that for any values of x and y, 1x - y22 = x2 - 2xy + y2.
3cos1A - B2 - 142 + 3sin1A - B2 - 042
   = 1cos A - cos B22 + 1sin A - sin B22
cos21A - B2 - 2 cos1A - B2 + 1 + sin21A - B2
   = cos2 A - 2 cos A cos B + cos2 B + sin2 A - 2 sin A sin B + sin2 B
For any value of x, sin2 x + cos2 x = 1, so we can rewrite the equation.
 2 - 2 cos1A - B2 = 2 - 2 cos A cos B - 2 sin A sin B      
Use sin2 x + cos2 x = 1 
three times and add like 
terms.
 cos1A −B2 = cos A cos B + sin A sin B
      Subtract 2, and then  
divide by -2.
This is the identity for cos1A - B2. Although Figure 4 shows angles A and B in 
the second and first quadrants, respectively, this result is the same for any values 
of these angles.
Cosine of a Sum or Difference
 cos1A + B2 = cos A cos B −sin A sin B
 cos1A −B2 = cos A cos B + sin A sin B
These identities are important in calculus and useful in certain applications. 
For example, the method shown in Example 1 can be applied to find an exact 
value for cos 15°.
Sum Identity for Cosine  To find a similar expression for cos1A + B2, 
rewrite A + B as A - 1-B2 and use the identity for cos1A - B2.

(a) To find cos 15°, we write 15° as the sum or difference of two angles with known 
function values, such as 45° and 30°, because
15° = 45° - 30°.   (We could also use 60° - 45°.)
 
Then we use the cosine difference identity.
cos 15°

Cofunction Identities 
 We can use the identity for the cosine of the differ-
ence of two angles and the fundamental identities to derive cofunction identities, 
presented previously for values of u in the interval 30°, 90°4. For example, sub-
stituting 90° for A and u for B in the identity for cos1A - B2 gives the following.
 cos190° −U2 = cos 90° cos u + sin 90° sin u 
Cosine difference identity
 = 0 # cos u + 1 # sin u
 
cos 90° = 0 and sin 90° = 1
 = sin U 
Simplify.
This result is true for any value of u because the identity for cos1A - B2 is true 
for any values of A and B.

214
CHAPTER 5 Trigonometric Identities
NOTE Because trigonometric (circular) functions are periodic, the solu-
tions in Example 2 are not unique. We give only one of infinitely many 
possibilities.
Cofunction Identities
The following identities hold for any angle u for which the functions are 
defined.
 cos190° −U2 = sin U   cot190° −U2 = tan U
 sin190° −U2 = cos U   sec190° −U2 = csc U
 tan190° −U2 = cot U   csc190° −U2 = sec U
The same identities can be obtained for a real number domain by replacing 
90° with p

(a) cot u = tan 25°   (b) sin u = cos1-30°2   (c) csc 3p

Applications of the Sum and Difference Identities 
 If either angle A

then the identity allows us to write the expression in terms of a single function 
of A or B.

Finding cos1s + t2 Given Information about s and t
Suppose that sin s = 3
5 , cos t = -  12
13 , and both s and t are in quadrant II. Find 
cos1s + t2.
SOLUTION By the cosine sum identity,
cos1s + t2 = cos s cos t - sin s sin t.
The values of sin s and cos t are given, so we can find cos1s + t2 if we know the 
values of cos s and sin t. There are two ways to do this.
Method 1 We use angles in standard position. To find cos s and sin t, we 
sketch two reference triangles in the second quadrant, one with sin s = 3
5 and  
the other with cos t = -  12
13 . Notice that for angle t, we use -12 to denote the 
length of the side that lies along the x-axis. See Figure 5.
In Figure 5(a), y = 3 and r = 5. We must find x.
 x2 + y2 = r2    Pythagorean theorem
 x2 + 32 = 52    Substitute.
 x2 = 16    Isolate x2.
 x = -4
Choose the negative 
square root here.
Choose the positive 
square root here.
Thus, cos s = x
r = -  4
5 .
In Figure 5(b), x = -12 and r = 13. We must find y.
 x2 + y2 = r2    Pythagorean theorem
 1-1222 + y2 = 132   Substitute.
 y2 = 25    Isolate y2.
 y = 5
Thus, sin t = y
r = 5
13 .
Now we can find cos1s + t2.

■✔ Now Try Exercise 51.
EXAMPLE 5 
Applying the Cosine Difference Identity to Voltage
Common household electric current is called alternating current because the 
current alternates direction within the wires. The voltage V in a typical 115-volt 
outlet can be expressed by the function
V1t2 = 163 sin vt,
where v is the angular speed (in radians per second) of the rotating generator at 
the electrical plant and t is time in seconds. (Source: Bell, D., Fundamentals of 
Electric Circuits, Fourth Edition, Prentice-Hall.)
(a) It is essential for electric generators to rotate at precisely 60 cycles per sec 
so household appliances and computers will function properly. Determine v 
for these electric generators.
(b) Graph V in the window 30, 0.054 by 3 -200, 2004.
(c) Determine a value of f so that the graph of
V1t2 = 163 cos1vt - f2 
is the same as the graph of
V1t2 = 163 sin vt.
sin t 7 0 because t 
is in quadrant II.
cos s 6 0 because s 
is in quadrant II.

217
5.3 Sum and Difference Identities for Cosine
SOLUTION
(a) We convert 60 cycles per sec to radians per second as follows.
v = 60 cycles
1 sec
# 2p radians
1 cycle
= 120p radians per sec.
(b)  
 V1t2 = 163 sin vt
 
 
 V1t2 = 163 sin 120pt   From part (a), v = 120p radians per sec.
 
Because the amplitude of the function V1t2 is 163, an appropriate interval for 
the range is 3 -200, 2004, as shown in the graph in Figure 6.
(c) Use the even-odd identity for cosine and a cofunction identity.
cos ax - p
2 b = cosc -  a p
2 - xb d = cos a p
2 - xb = sin x
 
Therefore, if f = p
2 , then
 V1t2 = 163 cos1vt - f2
 V1t2 = 163 cos avt - p

 V1t2 = 163 sin vt.

CHAPTER 5 Trigonometric Identities
76. Sound Waves Sound is a result of waves applying 
pressure to a person’s eardrum. For a pure sound 
wave radiating outward in a spherical shape, the trig-
onometric function
P = a
r cos a2pr
l
- ctb
  can be used to model the sound pressure at a radius of 
r feet from the source, where t is time in seconds, l is 
length of the sound wave in feet, c is speed of sound 
in feet per second, and a is maximum sound pressure 
at the source measured in pounds per square foot. 
(Source: Beranek, L., Noise and Vibration Control, 
Institute of Noise Control Engineering, Washington, 
D.C.) Let l = 4.9 ft and c = 1026 ft per sec.
(a)  Let a = 0.4 lb per ft2. Graph the sound pressure at distance r = 10 ft from its 
source in the window 30, 0.054 by 3-0.05, 0.054. Describe P at this distance.
(b)  Now let a = 3 and t = 10. Graph the sound pressure in the window 30, 204 by 
3-2, 24. What happens to pressure P as radius r increases?
(c)  Suppose a person stands at a radius r so that r = nl, where n is a positive integer. 
Use the difference identity for cosine to simplify P in this situation.
Relating Concepts
For individual or collaborative investigation (Exercises 77—82)
(This discussion applies to functions of both angles and real numbers.) The result of 
Example 3 in this section can be written as an identity.
cos1180° −U2 = −cos U
This is an example of a reduction formula, which is an identity that reduces a func-
tion of a quadrantal angle plus or minus u to a function of u alone. Another example 
of a reduction formula is
cos1270° + U2 = sin U.
Here is an interesting method for quickly determining a reduction formula for a 
trigonometric function ƒ of the form 
ƒ1Q t U2, where Q is a quadrantal angle.
There are two cases to consider, and in each case, think of U as a small positive 
angle in order to determine the quadrant in which Q { u will lie.
 
(Modeling) Solve each problem. See Example 5.
75. Electric Current The voltage V in a typical 115-volt outlet can be expressed by the 
function
V1t2 = 163 sin 120pt,
  where 120p is the angular speed (in radians per second) of the rotating generator at 
an electrical power plant, and t is time in seconds. (Source: Bell, D., Fundamentals 
of Electric Circuits, Fourth Edition, Prentice-Hall.)
(a) How many times does the current oscillate in 0.05 sec?
(b)  What are the maximum and minimum voltages in this outlet?
(c) Is the voltage always equal to 115 volts?

5.4 Sum and Difference Identities for Sine and Tangent
Case 1 Q is a quadrantal angle whose terminal side lies along the x-axis.
Determine the quadrant in which Q { u will lie for a small positive angle u.  
If the given function ƒ is positive in that quadrant, use a + sign on the 
reduced form. If ƒ is negative in that quadrant, use a - sign. The reduced  
form will have that sign, ƒ as the function, and u as the argument. 
Example:
Cosine is negative  
in quadrant II.
Terminates on 
the x-axis
(1+)+1*
This is in  
quadrant II  
for small u.
Same function
cos1180° - u2    
=     
-cos u
Case 2 Q is a quadrantal angle whose terminal side lies along the y-axis.
Determine the quadrant in which Q { u will lie for a small positive angle u.  
If the given function ƒ is positive in that quadrant, use a + sign on the 
reduced form. If ƒ is negative in that quadrant, use a - sign. The reduced 
form will have that sign, the cofunction of ƒ as the function, and u as the 
argument.
Example:
Terminates on 
the y-axis
Cosine is positive  
in quadrant IV.
cos1270° + u2

This is in

Angle YOQ = u and OQ = r. The coordinates of Q are 1x, y, z2, where
y = r cos u and z = r sin u.
When the spacecraft performs a rotation, it is necessary to find the coordinates in the 
spacecraft system after the rotation takes place. For example, suppose the spacecraft 
undergoes roll through angle R. The coordinates 1x, y, z2 of point Q become 1x′, y′, z′2, 
the coordinates of the corresponding point Q′. In the new reference system, OQ′ = r 
and, because the roll is around the x-axis and angle Y′OQ′ = YOQ = u,
x′ = x, y′ = r cos1u + R2, and z′ = r sin1u + R2.

Double-Angle Identities
Double-Angle Identities 
 When A = B in the identities for the sum of two 
angles, the double-angle identities result. To derive an expression for cos 2A,  
we let B = A in the identity cos1A + B2 = cos A cos B - sin A sin B.
 cos 2  A = cos1A + A2
   2A = A + A
 = cos A cos A - sin A sin A   Cosine sum identity
 cos 2  A = cos2 A −sin2 A
   a # a = a2
Two other useful forms of this identity can be obtained by substituting 
cos2 A = 1 - sin2 A or sin2 A = 1 - cos2 A. 
Replacing cos2 A with the expression 1 - sin2 A gives the following.
 cos 2  A = cos2 A - sin2 A
   Double-angle identity from above
 = 11 - sin2 A2 - sin2 A   Fundamental identity
 cos 2  A = 1 −2 sin2 A
   Subtract.
Replacing sin2 A with 1 - cos2 A gives a third form.
 cos 2  A = cos2 A - sin2 A
   Double-angle identity from above
 = cos2 A - 11 - cos2 A2   Fundamental identity
 = cos2 A - 1 + cos2 A

If a toaster is plugged into a common household outlet, the wattage consumed is 
not constant. Instead, it varies at a high frequency according to the model
W = V2
R
 ,
where V is the voltage and R is a constant that measures the resistance of the 
toaster in ohms. (Source: Bell, D., Fundamentals of Electric Circuits, Fourth 
Edition, Prentice-Hall.)
Graph the wattage W consumed by a toaster with R = 15 and 
V = 163 sin 120pt in the window 30, 0.054 by 3 -500, 20004. How many 
oscillations are there?
SOLUTION Substituting the given values into the wattage equation gives
W = V2
R = 1163 sin 120pt22

 .
To determine the range of W, we note that sin 120pt has maximum value 1, so 
the expression for W has maximum value 1632

a product-to-sum identity that is useful in calculus.
 
 cos1A + B2 = cos A cos B - sin A sin B
 
 
cos1A - B2 = cos A cos B + sin A sin B

70. Amperage, Wattage, and Voltage Amperage is a measure of the amount of electricity  
that is moving through a circuit, whereas voltage is a measure of the force pushing 
the electricity. The wattage W consumed by an electrical device can be determined 
by calculating the product of the amperage I and voltage V. (Source: Wilcox, G. and 
C. Hesselberth, Electricity for Engineering Technology, Allyn & Bacon.)

V = 163 sin 120pt
when an incandescent light bulb is turned on with 
amperage

bulb in the window 30, 0.054 by 3-50, 3004.
(b) Determine the maximum and minimum wattages used by the light bulb.
(c) Use identities to determine values for a, c, and v so that W = a cos1vt2 + c.
(d) Check by graphing both expressions for W on the same coordinate axes.
(e)  Use the graph to estimate the average wattage used by the light. For how many 
watts (to the nearest integer) would this incandescent light bulb be rated?

Half-Angle Identities
Half-Angle Identities 
 From alternative forms of the identity for cos 2A, 
we derive identities for sin A
2 , cos A
2 , and tan A
2 , known as half-angle identities.
We derive the identity for sin A
2 as follows.
 cos 2x = 1 - 2 sin2 x
 
Cosine double-angle identity
 2 sin2 x = 1 - cos 2x
 
Add 2 sin2 x and subtract cos 2x.
 sin x = tB
1 - cos 2  x
2
  
Divide by 2 and take square roots.
 sin A
2 = tÅ
1 −cos A
2
 
Let 2x = A, so x = A
2 . Substitute.

■ Applications of the 
Half-Angle Identities
■ Verifying an Identity
Remember both the 
positive and negative  
square roots.
The { symbol indicates that the appropriate sign is chosen depending on the 
quadrant of A
2 . For example, if  A
2 is a quadrant III angle, we choose the negative 
sign because the sine function is negative in quadrant III.

5.6 Half-Angle Identities
We derive the identity for cos A
2 using another double-angle identity.
 cos 2x = 2 cos2 x - 1
 
Cosine double-angle identity
 1 + cos 2x = 2 cos2 x
 
Add 1.
 cos2 x = 1 + cos 2x

Rewrite and divide by 2.
 cos x = {B

Take square roots.
 cos A

An identity for tan A

From the identity tan A
2 =
sin A
1 + cos A , we can also derive an equivalent identity.
tan A
2 = 1 −cos A
sin A
Half-Angle Identities
In the following identities, the { symbol indicates that the sign is chosen 
based on the function under consideration and the quadrant of A
2 .
cos  A
2 = tÅ
1 + cos A
2
   sin  A
2 = tÅ
1 −cos A

tan A
2 = tÅ
1 −cos A
1 + cos A  tan A
2 =
sin A
1 + cos A  tan A
2 = 1 −cos A
sin A
 
Three of these identities require a sign choice. When using these identities, 
select the plus or minus sign according to the quadrant in which A
2 terminates. For 
example, if an angle A = 324°, then A
2 = 162°, which lies in quadrant II. So when 
A = 324°, cos A
2 and tan A
2 are negative, and sin A
2 is positive.

(Modeling) Mach Number An airplane flying 
faster than the speed of sound sends out sound 
waves that form a cone, as shown in the figure.  
The cone intersects the ground to form a  
hyperbola. As this hyperbola passes over  
a particular point on the ground, a sonic boom 
is heard at that point. If u is the angle at the 
vertex of the cone, then
sin u
2 = 1
m
 ,
where m is the Mach number for the speed of the plane. (We assume m 7 1.) The Mach 
number is the ratio of the speed of the plane to the speed of sound. Thus, a speed of  
Mach 1.4 means that the plane is flying at 1.4 times the speed of sound.

For individual or collaborative investigation (Exercises 77–84)
These exercises use results from plane geom-
etry to obtain exact values of the trigonometric 
functions of 15°.
Start with a right triangle ACB having 
a 60° angle at A and a 30° angle at B. Let 
the hypotenuse of this triangle have length 2. 
Extend side BC and draw a semicircle with 
diameter along BC extended, center at B, and 
radius AB. Draw segment AE. (See the figure.) Any angle inscribed in a semicircle 
is a right angle, so triangle EAD is a right triangle. Work Exercises 77– 84 in order.
77. Why is AB = BD true? Conclude that triangle ABD is isosceles.
78. Why does angle ABD have measure 150°?
79. Why do angles DAB and ADB both have measures of 15°?
80. What is the length DC?

CHAPTER 6 Inverse Circular Functions and Trigonometric Equations
Inverse Functions 
 We now review some basic concepts from algebra. 
For a function ƒ, every element x in the domain corresponds to one and only 
one element y, or ƒ1x2, in the range. This means the following:
1. If point 1a, b2 lies on the graph of ƒ, then there is no other point on the 
graph that has a as first coordinate.
2. Other points may have b as second coordinate, however, because the defi-
nition of function allows range elements to be used more than once.
If a function is defined so that each range element is used only once, then it 
is a one-to-one function. For example, the function
ƒ1x2 = x3 is a one@to@one function
because every real number has exactly one real cube root. However,
g1x2 = x2 is not a one@to@one function
because g122 = 4 and g1-22 = 4. There are two domain elements, 2 and -2, 
that correspond to the range element 4.
The horizontal line test helps determine graphically whether a function is 
one-to-one.

This test is applied to the graphs of ƒ1x2 = x3 and g1x2 = x2 in Figure 1.
By interchanging the components of the ordered pairs of a one-to-one  
function ƒ, we obtain a new set of ordered pairs that satisfies the definition of  
a function. This new function is the inverse function, or inverse, of ƒ.
The special notation used for inverse functions is ƒ−1 (read “ƒ-inverse”). 
It represents the function created by interchanging the input (domain) and the 
output (range) of a one-to-one function.
Horizontal Line Test
A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph of the 
function at most once.

Inverse Function
The inverse function of a one-to-one function ƒ is defined as follows.
ƒ  −1 = 5 1  y, x2
 ∣1x, y2 belongs to ƒ 6
CAUTION Do not confuse the −1 in ƒ−1 with a negative exponent.  
The symbol ƒ -11x2 represents the inverse function of ƒ, not 1
ƒ1x2 .

253
6.1 Inverse Circular Functions
The following statements summarize the concepts of inverse functions.
Summary of Inverse Functions
1. In a one-to-one function, each x-value corresponds to only one y-value 
and each y-value corresponds to only one x-value.
2. If a function ƒ is one-to-one, then ƒ has an inverse function ƒ-1.
3. The domain of ƒ is the range of ƒ-1, and the range of ƒ is the domain of 
ƒ -1. That is, if the point 1a, b2 lies on the graph of ƒ, then the point 1b, a2 
lies on the graph of ƒ-1.
4.  The graphs of ƒ and ƒ-1 are reflections of each other across the line  
y = x.
5. To find ƒ-11x2 for ƒ1x2, follow these steps.
Step 1 Replace ƒ1x2 with y and interchange x and y.
Step 2 Solve for y.
Step 3 Replace y with ƒ-11x2.
Figure 2 illustrates some of these concepts.

We often restrict the domain of a function that is not one-to-one to make it 
one-to-one without changing the range. We saw in Figure 1 that g1x2 = x2, with 
its natural domain 1-∞, ∞2, is not one-to-one. However, if we restrict its domain 
to the set of nonnegative numbers 30, ∞2, we obtain a new function ƒ that is  
one-to-one and has the same range as g, 30, ∞2. See Figure 3.
If the domain of g(x) = x2 is
restricted so that x ≥ 0, then
it is a one-to-one function.
g(x) = x2, x ≥ 0

Figure 3  
NOTE We could have restricted the domain of g1x2 = x2 to 1-∞, 04 to 
obtain a different one-to-one function. For the trigonometric functions, such 
choices are based on general agreement by mathematicians.
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
The inverse circular functions are 
used in calculus to solve certain types  
of related-rates problems and to 
integrate certain rational functions.
Inverse Sine Function  Refer to the graph of the sine function in Figure 4 
on the next page. Applying the horizontal line test, we see that y = sin x does  
not define a one-to-one function. If we restrict the domain to the interval  
C -  p
2 , p
2 D  , which is the part of the graph in  Figure 4  shown in color, this restricted 
function is one-to-one and has an inverse function. The range of y = sin x is 
3 -1, 14 , so the domain of the inverse function will be 3 -1, 14, and its range 
will be C -  p
2 , p
2 D  .

254
CHAPTER 6 Inverse Circular Functions and Trigonometric Equations
Reflecting the graph of y = sin x on the restricted domain, shown in Fig-
ure 5(a), across the line y = x gives the graph of the inverse function, shown in  
Figure 5(b). Some key points are labeled on the graph. The equation of the 
inverse of y = sin x is found by interchanging x and y to obtain
x = sin y.
This equation is solved for y by writing
y = sin−1 x (read “inverse sine of x”).
As Figure 5(b) shows, the domain of y = sin-1 x is 3 -1, 14, while the restricted 
domain of y = sin x, C -  p
2 , p
2 D  , is the range of y = sin-1 x. An alternative nota-
tion for sin−1 x is arcsin x.

Inverse Sine Function
y = sin−1 x or y = arcsin x means that x = sin y, for -  p
2 … y … p
2  .
We can think of y = sin−1 x or y = arcsin x as  
“y is the number (angle) in the interval C−P
2  , P
2 D whose sine is x.”
Thus, we can write y = sin-1 x as sin y = x to evaluate it. We must pay close 
attention to the domain and range intervals.

6.1 Inverse Circular Functions
 
CAUTION In Example 1(b), it is tempting to give the value of sin-11-12 
as 3p
2   because sin 3p
2 = -1. However, 3p
2  is not in the range of the inverse 
sine function. Be certain that the number given for an inverse function 
value is in the range of the particular inverse function being considered.

Finding Inverse Sine Values
Find the value of each real number y if it exists.
(a) y = arcsin 1
2    (b) y = sin-11-12    (c) y = sin-11-22
ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION
(a) The graph of the function defined by y = arcsin x 
(Figure 5(b)) includes the point A1
2 , p
6 B . Therefore, 
arcsin 1
2 = p
6 .
Alternatively, we can think of y = arcsin 1
2 
as “y is the number in C -  p
2 , p
2 D whose sine is 1
2 .” 
Then we can write the given equation as sin y = 1
2 .  
Because sin p
6 = 1
2 and p
6 is in the range of the arc-
sine function, y = p
6  .
(b) Writing the equation y = sin-11-12 in the form 
sin y = -1 shows that y = -  p
2  . Notice that the 
point A -1, -  p
2 B is on the graph of y = sin-1 x.
(c) Because -2 is not in the domain of the inverse sine 
function, sin-11-22 does not exist.
GRAPHING CALCULATOR SOLUTION
(a)–(c) We graph the equation y1 = sin-1 x and find 
the points with x-values 1
2 = 0.5 and -1. For these two 
x-values, Figure 6 indicates that y = p
6 ≈0.52359878

30, p4 as in Figure 8. This restricted function, which is the part of the graph in 
Figure 8 shown in color, is one-to-one and has an inverse function. The inverse 
function, y = cos-1 x, is found by interchanging the roles of x and y. Reflecting 
the graph of y = cos x across the line y = x gives the graph of the inverse func-
tion shown in Figure 9. Some key points are shown on the graph.

We can think of y = cos−1 x or y = arccos x as
“y is the number (angle) in the interval 30, P4 whose cosine is x.”
Inverse Cosine Function
y = cos−1 x or y = arccos x means that x = cos y, for 0 … y … p.
EXAMPLE 2 
Finding Inverse Cosine Values
Find the value of each real number y if it exists.
(a) y = arccos 1 
(b) y = cos-1 ¢ -  22
2 ≤
SOLUTION
(a) Because the point 11, 02 lies on the graph of y = arccos x in Figure 9, the 
value of y, or arccos 1, is 0. Alternatively, we can think of y = arccos 1 as
“y is the number in 30, p4 whose cosine is 1,” or cos y = 1.
Thus, y = 0, since cos 0 = 1 and 0 is in the range of the arccosine function.
(b) We must find the value of y that satisfies
cos y = -  22
2  , where y is in the interval 30, p4,
which is the range of the function y = cos-1 x. The only value for y that 
satisfies these conditions is 3p
4 . Again, this can be verified from the graph in 
Figure 9.

roles of x and y, we obtain the inverse tangent function given by

missing point).

 Finding Inverse Function Values  
(Degree-Measured Angles)
Find the degree measure of u if it exists.
(a) u = arctan 1 
(b) u = sec-1 2
SOLUTION
(a) Here u must be in 1-90°, 90°2, but because 1 is positive, u must be in quad-
rant I. The alternative statement, tan u = 1, leads to u = 45°.
(b) Write the equation as sec u = 2. For sec-1 x, u is in quadrant I or II. Because 
2 is positive, u is in quadrant I and u = 60°, since sec 60° = 2. Note that 60° 
1the degree equivalent of p
3 B  is in the range of the inverse secant function.
■✔ Now Try Exercises 37 and 45.
The inverse trigonometric function keys on a calculator give correct results 
for the inverse sine, inverse cosine, and inverse tangent functions.
 sin-1 0.5 = 30°,  
sin-1 1-0.52 = -30°, 
Degree mode
 tan-11-12 = -45°, and   cos-11-0.52 = 120°
However, finding cot-1 x, sec-1 x, and csc-1 x with a calculator is not as 
straightforward because these functions must first be expressed in terms of tan-1 x, 
cos-1 x, and sin-1 x, respectively. If y = sec-1 x, for example, then we have 
sec y = x, which must be written in terms of cosine as follows.
If sec y = x, then 1
cos y = x, or cos y = 1
x , and y = cos-1 1
x .
Inverse Function Values 
 The inverse circular functions are formally  
defined with real number ranges. However, there are times when it may be con-
venient to find degree-measured angles equivalent to these real number values. It 
is also often convenient to think in terms of the unit circle and choose the inverse 
function values on the basis of the quadrants given in the preceding table.

Finding Inverse Function Values with a Calculator
Use a calculator to approximate each value.
(a) Find y in radians if y = csc-11-32.
(b) Find u in degrees if u = arccot1-0.35412.
SOLUTION
(a) With the calculator in radian mode, enter csc-1 1-32 as sin-1 A 1
-3B to obtain 
y ≈-0.3398369095. See Figure 15(a).
(b) A calculator in degree mode gives the inverse tangent value of a negative 
number as a quadrant IV angle. The restriction on the range of arccotangent 
implies that u must be in quadrant II.
arccot1-0.35412 is entered as tan-1 A

-0.3541B + 180°.
As shown in Figure 15(b),
u ≈109.4990544°.
✔ Now Try Exercises 53 and 65.
CAUTION Be careful when using a calculator to evaluate the inverse 
cotangent of a negative quantity. Enter the inverse tangent of the recipro-
cal of the negative quantity, which returns an angle in quadrant IV. Because 
inverse cotangent is negative in quadrant II, adjust the calculator result by 
adding p or 180° accordingly. (Note that cot-1 0 = p
2 or 90°.)

CHAPTER 6 Inverse Circular Functions and Trigonometric Equations
 6.2 
Trigonometric Equations  I
Earlier we studied trigonometric equations that were identities. We now consider 
trigonometric equations that are conditional. These equations are satisfied by 
some values but not others.
■ Linear Methods
■ Zero-Factor Property 
Method
■ Quadratic Methods
■ Trigonometric Identity 
Substitutions
■ An Application
Linear Methods  The most basic trigonometric equations are solved by 
first using properties of equality to isolate a trigonometric expression on one side 
of the equation.
EXAMPLE 1 
Solving a Trigonometric Equation (Linear Methods)
Solve the equation 2 sin u + 1 = 0
(a) over the interval 30°, 360°2 
(b) for all solutions.
ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION
(a) Because sin u is to the first power, we use the same 
method as we would to solve the linear equation 
2x + 1 = 0.
 2 sin u + 1 = 0
 
Original equation
 2 sin u = -1  
Subtract 1.
 sin u = -  1
2 
Divide by 2.
To find values of u that satisfy sin u = -  1
2 , we  
observe that u must be in either quadrant III or 
quadrant IV because the sine function is negative 
only in these two quadrants. Furthermore, the ref-
erence angle must be 30°. The graph of the unit 
circle in Figure 22 shows the two possible values 
of u. The solution set is 5210°, 330°6.
GRAPHING CALCULATOR SOLUTION
(a) Consider the original equation.
2 sin u + 1 = 0
We can find the solution set of this equation by 
graphing the function
y1 = 2 sin x + 1
and then determining its zeros. Because we are find-
ing solutions over the interval 30°, 360°2, we use  
degree mode and choose this interval of values for the  
input x on the graph.
The screen in Figure 23(a) indicates that one  
solution is 210°, and the screen in Figure 23(b)  
indicates that the other solution is 330°. The solution  
set is 5210°, 330°6, which agrees with the algebraic 
solution.

(b) To find all solutions, we add integer multiples of 
the period of the sine function, 360°, to each solu-
tion found in part (a). The solution set is written as 
follows.
5210° + 360°n , 330° + 360°n ,  
where n is any integer6
(b) Because the graph of
y1 = 2 sin x + 1
repeats the same y-values every 360°, all solutions 
are found by adding integer multiples of 360° to 
the solutions found in part (a). See the algebraic 
solution.

EXAMPLE 2 
Solving a Trigonometric Equation (Zero-Factor Property)
Solve sin u tan u = sin u over the interval  30°, 360°2.
SOLUTION 
 sin u tan u = sin u 
Original equation
 
 sin u tan u - sin u = 0
 
Subtract sin u.
 
 sin u 1tan u - 12 = 0
 
Factor out sin u.
sin u = 0  or  tan u - 1 = 0 
Zero-factor property
 tan u = 1
u = 0° or u = 180°  u = 45° or u = 225° 
Apply the inverse function.
See Figure 24. The solution set is 50°, 45°, 180°, 225°6.
✔ Now Try Exercise 35.

CAUTION Trying to solve the equation in Example 2 by dividing 
each side by sin u would lead to tan u = 1, which would give u = 45° or 
u = 225°. The missing two solutions are the ones that make the divisor,  
sin u, equal 0. For this reason, we avoid dividing by a variable expression.
Quadratic Methods  The equation au2 + bu + c = 0, where u is an alge-
braic expression, is solved by quadratic methods. The expression u may be a  
trigonometric function.
EXAMPLE 3 
Solving a Trigonometric Equation (Zero-Factor Property)
Solve tan2 x + tan x - 2 = 0 over the interval 30, 2p2.
SOLUTION 
tan2 x + tan x - 2 = 0 
This equation is quadratic in form.
 
1tan x - 12 1tan x + 22 = 0 
Factor.
 
tan x - 1 = 0 or tan x + 2 = 0 
Zero-factor property
 
tan x = 1 or      tan x = -2 
Solve each equation.
The solutions for tan x = 1 over the interval 30, 2p2 are x = p
4 and x = 5p
4 .
To solve tan x = -2 over that interval, we use a calculator set in radian mode. 
We find that tan-11-22 ≈-1.1071487. This is a quadrant IV number, based on  
the range of the inverse tangent function. However, because we want solutions  
over the interval 30, 2p2, we must first add p to -1.1071487, and then add 2p. 
See Figure 25.
x ≈-1.1071487 + p ≈2.0344439  
x ≈-1.1071487 + 2p ≈5.1760366

CHAPTER 6 Inverse Circular Functions and Trigonometric Equations
To find all solutions, we add integer multiples of the period of the tangent 
function, which is p, to each solution found previously. Although not unique, a 
common form of the solution set of the equation, written using the least possible 
nonnegative angle measures, is given as follows.
52.8476 + np, 1.2768 + np, where n is any integer6
Round to four decimal places.
✔ Now Try Exercise 57.
EXAMPLE 4 
Solving a Trigonometric Equation (Quadratic Formula)
Find all solutions of cot x1cot x + 32 = 1.
SOLUTION We multiply the factors on the left and subtract 1 to write the 
equation in standard quadratic form.
 cot x1cot x + 32 = 1 
Original equation
 cot2 x + 3 cot x - 1 = 0 
Distributive property; Subtract 1.
This equation is quadratic in form, but cannot be solved using the zero-factor 
property. Therefore, we use the quadratic formula, with a = 1, b = 3, c = -1, 
and cot x as the variable.
 
 
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
There are many instances in calculus 
where it is necessary to solve 
trigonometric equations. Examples 
include solving related-rates problems 
and optimization problems.
Trigonometric Identity Substitutions 
 Recall that squaring each side of 
an equation, such as
2x + 4 = x + 2,
will yield all solutions but may also give extraneous solutions—solutions that 
satisfy the final equation but not the original equation. As a result, all proposed 
solutions must be checked in the original equation as shown in Example 5.

6.2 Trigonometric Equations  I
EXAMPLE 5 
Solving a Trigonometric Equation (Squaring)
Solve tan x + 23 = sec x over the interval 30, 2p2.
SOLUTION We must rewrite the equation in terms of a single trigonometric 
function. Because the tangent and secant functions are related by the identity 
1 + tan2 x = sec2 x, square each side and express sec2 x in terms of tan2 x.
 Atan x + 23 B
2 = 1sec x22  
Square each side.
 tan2 x + 223 tan x + 3 = sec2 x
 
1x + y22 = x2 + 2x y + y2 
 tan2 x + 223 tan x + 3 = 1 + tan2 x 
Pythagorean identity
 223 tan x = -2
 
Subtract 3 + tan2 x.
 tan x = -  1
23
 
 Divide by 223. 
 tan x = -  23

Rationalize the denominator.
Solutions of tan x = -  23
3  over 30, 2p2 are 5p

posed, solutions must be checked to determine whether they are also solutions

y = tan x + 23 - sec x is 5.7595865, 
which is an approximation for 11p
6  , the 
solution found in Example 5.
Solving a Trigonometric Equation
1.  Decide whether the equation is linear or quadratic in form in order to 
determine the solution method.
2.  If only one trigonometric function is present, solve the equation for that 
function.
3.  If more than one trigonometric function is present, rewrite the equation so 
that one side equals 0. Then try to factor and apply the zero-factor property.
4.  If the equation is quadratic in form, but not factorable, use the quadratic 
formula. Check that solutions are in the desired interval.
5.  Try using identities to change the form of the equation. It may be helpful 
to square each side of the equation first. In this case, check for extraneous 
solutions.

An Application 
 
EXAMPLE 6 
Describing a Musical Tone from a Graph
A basic component of music is a pure tone. The graph in Figure 26 models the 
sinusoidal pressure y = P in pounds per square foot from a pure tone at time 
x = t in seconds.
(a) The frequency of a pure tone is often measured in hertz. One hertz is equal 
to one cycle per second and is abbreviated Hz. What is the frequency ƒ, in 
hertz, of the pure tone shown in the graph?
(b) The time for the tone to produce one complete cycle is the period. Approxi-
mate the period T, in seconds, of the pure tone.
(c) An equation for the graph is y = 0.004 sin 300px. Use a calculator to estimate 
all solutions that make y = 0.004 over the interval 30, 0.024.
SOLUTION
(a) From Figure 26, we see that there are 6 cycles in 0.04 sec. This is equivalent 
to 6
0.04 = 150 cycles per sec. The pure tone has a frequency of ƒ = 150 Hz.
(b) Six periods cover a time interval of 0.04 sec. One period would be equal to 
T = 0.04

=
1
150 , or 0.006 sec.
(c) If we reproduce the graph in Figure 26 on a calculator as y1 and also graph a 
second function as y2 = 0.004, we can determine that the approximate values 
of x at the points of intersection of the graphs over the interval 30, 0.024 are
0.0017, 0.0083, and 0.015.
The first value is shown in Figure  27. These values represent time in seconds.

65. Pressure on the Eardrum See Example 6. No musical instrument can generate a true 
pure tone. A pure tone has a unique, constant frequency and amplitude that sounds 
rather dull and uninteresting. The pressures caused by pure tones on the eardrum are 
sinusoidal. The change in pressure P in pounds per square foot on a person’s eardrum 
from a pure tone at time t in seconds can be modeled using the equation
P = A sin12pƒt + f2,
where ƒ is the frequency in cycles per second, and f is the phase angle. When P is 
positive, there is an increase in pressure and the eardrum is pushed inward. When 
P is negative, there is a decrease in pressure and the eardrum is pushed outward.

of the vehicle when it hits the obstruction, 
D is distance (in feet) from the obstruction to the landing point, and h is the dif-
ference in height (in feet) between landing point and takeoff point. Angle u is

EXAMPLE 2 
Solving an Equation Using a Double-Angle Identity
Solve cos 2x = cos x over the interval 30, 2p2.
SOLUTION First convert cos 2x to a function of x alone. Use the identity 
cos 2x = 2 cos2 x - 1 so that the equation involves only cos x. Then factor.
 cos 2x = cos x 
Original equation
 2 cos2 x - 1 = cos x 
Cosine double-angle identity
 2 cos2 x - cos x - 1 = 0
 
Subtract cos x.
 12 cos x + 12 1cos x - 12 = 0
 
Factor.
 2 cos x + 1 = 0
  or  cos x - 1 = 0 
Zero-factor property
 cos x = -  1
2  or   cos x = 1 
Solve each equation for cos x.
If we use the unit circle to analyze these results, we recognize that a radian-
measured angle having cosine -  1

angle p

EXAMPLE 3 
Solving an Equation Using a Double-Angle Identity
Solve 4 sin u cos u = 23
(a) over the interval 30°, 360°2 
(b) for all solutions.
SOLUTION
(a)  
 4 sin u cos u = 23 
Original equation
 212 sin u cos u2 = 23 
4 = 2 # 2
 2 sin 2u = 23 
Sine double-angle identity
 sin 2u = 23
2  
Divide by 2.
From the given interval 0° … u 6 360°, the corresponding interval for 2u is 
0° … 2u 6 720°. Because the sine is positive in quadrants I and II, solutions 
over this interval are as follows.
 
 2u = 60°, 120°, 420°, 480°, 
Reference angle is 60°.
or 
 u = 30°, 60°, 210°, 240°  
Divide by 2.
The final two solutions for 2u were found by adding 360° to 60° and 120°, 
respectively, which gives the solution set 530°, 60°, 210°, 240°6.
CAUTION Because 2 is not a factor of cos 2x, cos 2x
2
≠cos x. In Exam-
ple 2, we changed cos 2x to a function of x alone using an identity.

6.3 Trigonometric Equations  II

 Add integer multiples  
of 360°.
 u = 30° + 180°n and  u = 60° + 180°n  
Divide by 2.
All solutions are given by the following set, where 180° represents the period 
of sin 2u.

✔ Now Try Exercises 23 and 47.
NOTE Solving an equation by squaring both sides may introduce extra-
neous values. We use this method in Example 4, and all proposed solutions 
must be checked.
EXAMPLE 4 
Solving an Equation with a Multiple Angle
Solve tan 3x + sec 3x = 2 over the interval 30, 2p2.
SOLUTION The tangent and secant functions are related by the identity 
1 + tan2 x = sec2 x. One way to begin is to express the left side in terms of  
secant.
 tan 3x + sec 3x = 2
 tan 3x = 2 - sec 3x
 
Subtract sec 3x.
 1tan 3x22 = 12 - sec 3x22
      Square each side.
 tan2 3x = 4 - 4 sec 3x + sec2 3x  1x - y22 = x2 - 2xy + y2 
 sec2 3x - 1 = 4 - 4 sec 3x + sec2 3x

Both sides of the equation were squared, so each proposed solution must be 
checked. Verify by substitution in the given equation that the solution set is
50.2145, 2.3089, 4.40336.

CHAPTER 6 Inverse Circular Functions and Trigonometric Equations
An Application  A piano string can vibrate at more than one frequency 
when it is struck. It produces a complex wave that can mathematically be modeled 
by a sum of several pure tones. When a piano key with a frequency of ƒ1 is played, 
the corresponding string vibrates not only at ƒ1 but also at the higher frequencies 
of 2ƒ1 , 3ƒ1 , 4ƒ1 , . . . , nƒ1. ƒ1 is the fundamental frequency of the string, and 
higher frequencies are the upper harmonics. The human ear will hear the sum of 
these frequencies as one complex tone. (Source: Roederer, J., Introduction to the 
Physics and Psychophysics of Music, Second Edition, Springer-Verlag.)
EXAMPLE 5  
Analyzing Pressures of Upper Harmonics
Suppose that the A key above middle C is played on a piano. Its fundamental 
frequency is ƒ1 = 440 Hz, and its associated pressure is expressed as
P1 = 0.002 sin 880pt.
The string will also vibrate at
ƒ2 = 880, ƒ3 = 1320, ƒ4 = 1760, ƒ5 = 2200, . . . . Hz.
The corresponding pressures of these upper harmonics are as follows.
P2 = 0.002

same tone on two different instruments and listening for a phenomenon known as 
beats. Beats occur when two tones vary in frequency by only a few hertz. When the

the pressure slowly rises and falls as a result of this slight variation in the frequency.

6.4 Equations Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Because the function y = 3 cos 2x is periodic, with period p, there are 
infinitely many domain values (x-values) that will result in a given range value 
( y-value). For example, the x-values 0 and p both correspond to the y-value 3. 
See Figure 31. The restriction 0 … x … p
2 given in the original problem ensures 
that this function is one-to-one, and, correspondingly, that
x = 1
2 arccos y
3
has a one-to-one relationship. Thus, each y-value in 3 -3, 34 substituted into 
this equation will lead to a single x-value.

form in order to determine the solution method.
2.  If only one trigonometric function is present, solve the 
equation for that function.

Oblique Triangles and the Law of Sines
Congruency and Oblique Triangles 
 We now turn our attention to solving 
triangles that are not right triangles. To do this we develop new relationships, or 
laws, that exist between the sides and angles of any triangle. The congruence 
axioms assist in this process. Recall that two triangles are congruent if their 
corresponding sides and angles are equal.

■ Solutions of SAA and 
ASA Triangles (Case 1)
■ Area of a Triangle
Congruence Axioms
Side-Angle-Side 
(SAS)
If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are 
equal, respectively, to two sides and the included angle 
of a second triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
Angle-Side-Angle 
(ASA)
If two angles and the included side of one triangle are 
equal, respectively, to two angles and the included side 
of a second triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
Side-Side-Side 
(SSS)
If three sides of one triangle are equal, respectively, to 
three sides of a second triangle, then the triangles are 
congruent.

If a side and any two angles are given (SAA), the third angle can be determined 
by the angle sum formula
A + B + C = 180°.
Then the ASA axiom can be applied. Whenever SAS, ASA, or SSS is given, the 
triangle is unique.
A triangle that is not a right triangle is an oblique triangle. Recall that a 
triangle can be solved—that is, the measures of the three sides and three angles 
can be found—if at least one side and any other two measures are known.
NOTE If we know three angles of a triangle, we cannot find unique 
side lengths because AAA assures us only of similarity, not congruence. 
For example, there are infinitely many triangles ABC of different sizes with 
A = 35°, B = 65°, and C = 80°.
Data Required for Solving Oblique Triangles
There are four possible cases.
Case 1 One side and two angles are known (SAA or ASA).
Case 2  Two sides and one angle not included between the two sides are 
known (SSA). This case may lead to more than one triangle.
Case 3  Two sides and the angle included between the two sides are known 
(SAS).
Case 4 Three sides are known (SSS).

7.1 Oblique Triangles and the Law of Sines
Derivation of the Law of Sines 
 To derive the law of sines, we start with 
an oblique triangle, such as the acute triangle in Figure 1(a) or the obtuse triangle 
in Figure 1(b). This discussion applies to both triangles. First, construct the per-
pendicular from B to side AC (or its extension). Let h be the length of this perpen-
dicular. Then c is the hypotenuse of right triangle ADB, and a is the hypotenuse 
of right triangle BDC.
 In triangle ADB,  sin A = h
c
 , or h = c sin A.
 In triangle BDC,  sin C = h
a
 , or h = a sin C.
Because h = c sin A and h = a sin C, we set these two expressions equal.
 a sin C = c sin A
 a
sin A =
c
sin C
  Divide each side by sin A sin C.
In a similar way, by constructing perpendicular lines from the other vertices,  
we can show that these two equations are also true.
a
sin A =
b
sin B and 
b
sin B =
c
sin C
This discussion proves the following theorem.
Solving a triangle with given information matching Case 1 or Case 2 
requires using the law of sines, while solving a triangle with given information 
matching Case 3 or Case 4 requires using the law of cosines.

We label oblique triangles as we did 
right triangles: side a opposite angle A, 
side b opposite angle B, and side c  
opposite angle C.

a
sin A =

This can be written in compact form as follows.

That is, according to the law of sines, the lengths of the sides in a triangle are 
proportional to the sines of the measures of the angles opposite them.
In practice we can also use an alternative form of the law of sines.
sin A
a
= sin B
b
= sin C
c
    Alternative form of  
the law of sines
NOTE When using the law of sines, a good strategy is to select a form 
that has the unknown variable in the numerator and where all other variables 
are known. This makes computation easier.

EXAMPLE 1 
Applying the Law of Sines (SAA)
Solve triangle ABC if A = 32.0°, B = 81.8°, and a = 42.9 cm.
SOLUTION Start by drawing a triangle, roughly to scale, and labeling the given 
parts as in Figure 2. The values of A, B, and a are known, so use the form of the 
law of sines that involves these variables, and then solve for b.

   Approximate with a calculator.
To find C, use the fact that the sum of the angles of any triangle is 180°.
 A + B + C = 180°
   Angle sum formula
 C = 180° - A - B
   Solve for C.
 C = 180° - 32.0° - 81.8°   Substitute.
 C = 66.2°
   Subtract.
Now use the law of sines to find c. (The Pythagorean theorem does not apply 
because this is not a right triangle.)

An engineer wishes to measure the distance across a river. See Figure 3. He 
determines that C = 112.90°, A = 31.10°, and b = 347.6 ft. Find the distance a.
SOLUTION To use the law of sines, one side and the angle opposite it must be 
known. Here b is the only side whose length is given, so angle B must be found 
before the law of sines can be used.
 B = 180° - A - C
   Angle sum formula, solved for B
 B = 180° - 31.10° - 112.90°   Substitute the given values.

for expressing bearing.

as 220°, this bearing is measured in 
a clockwise direction from north.

the western station?
SOLUTION 
Figure 4 shows the two ranger stations at points A and B and the 
fire at point C. Angle BAC measures 90° - 42° = 48°, obtuse angle B measures 
90° + 15° = 105°, and the third angle, C, measures 180° - 105° - 48° = 27°.

  The circle in the figure has diameter 1. What are the values 
of a, b, and c? (Note: This result provides an alternative way 
to define the sine function for angles between 0° and 180°. 
It was used nearly 2000 yr ago by the mathematician  
Ptolemy to construct one of the earliest trigonometric tables.)
62. Theorem of Ptolemy The following theorem is also attributed to Ptolemy:
   
 In a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, the product of 
the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the 
opposite sides.
  (Source: Eves, H., An Introduction to the History of Math-
ematics, Sixth Edition, Saunders College Publishing.) The 
circle in the figure has diameter 1. Use Ptolemy’s theorem 
to derive the formula for the sine of the sum of two angles.
63. Law of Sines Several of the exercises on right triangle 
applications involved a figure similar to the one shown 
here, in which angles a and b and the length of line 
segment AB are known, and the length of side CD is to 
be determined. Use the law of sines to obtain x in terms 
of a, b, and d.
64. Aerial Photography Aerial photographs can be 
used to provide coordinates of ordered pairs to 
determine distances on the ground. Suppose we 
assign coordinates as shown in the figure. If an 
object’s photographic coordinates are 1x, y2, then 
its ground coordinates 1X, Y2 in feet can be com-
puted using the following formulas.
X =
1a - h2x
ƒ sec u - y sin u
 , Y =
1a - h2y cos u
ƒ sec u - y sin u
  Here, ƒ is focal length of the camera in inches, a is 
altitude in feet of the airplane, and h is elevation in feet of the object. Suppose that 
a house has photographic coordinates 1xH, yH2 = 10.9, 3.52 with elevation 150 ft, 
and a nearby forest fire has photographic coordinates 1xF, yF2 = 12.1, -2.42 and 
is at elevation 690 ft. Also suppose the photograph was taken at 7400 ft by a camera 
with focal length 6 in. and tilt angle u = 4.1°. (Source: Moffitt, F. and E. Mikhail, 
Photogrammetry, Third Edition, Harper & Row.)
(a)  Use the formulas to find the ground coordinates of the house and the fire to the 
nearest tenth of a foot.

The Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines
Description of the Ambiguous Case 
 We have used the law of sines to 
solve triangles involving Case 1, given SAA or ASA. If we are given the lengths 
of two sides and the angle opposite one of them (Case 2, SSA), then zero, one, or 
two such triangles may exist. (There is no SSA congruence axiom.)
Suppose we know the measure of acute angle A of triangle ABC, the length 
of side a, and the length of side b, as shown in Figure 8. We must draw the side 
of length a opposite angle A. The table shows possible outcomes. This situation 
(SSA) is called the ambiguous case of the law of sines.

The following basic facts help determine which situation applies.
Applying the Law of Sines
1. For any angle u of a triangle, 0 6 sin u … 1. If sin u = 1, then u = 90° 
and the triangle is a right triangle.
2. sin u = sin1180° - u2 (Supplementary angles have the same sine value.)
3. The smallest angle is opposite the shortest side, the largest angle is opposite 
the longest side, and the middle-valued angle is opposite the intermediate 
side (assuming the triangle has sides that are all of different lengths).

7.2 The Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines
Solutions of SSA Triangles (Case 2)
EXAMPLE 1 
Solving the Ambiguous Case (No Such Triangle)
Solve triangle ABC if B = 55° 40′, b = 8.94 m, and a = 25.1 m.
SOLUTION We are given B, b, and a. We use the law of sines to find angle A.
 sin A
a
= sin B
b
   Law of sines (alternative form)
 sin A
25.1 = sin 55° 40′
8.94
   Substitute the given values.
 sin A = 25.1 sin 55° 40′
8.94
   Multiply by 25.1.
 sin A ≈2.3184379
   Use a calculator.
Choose a form  
that has the 
unknown variable  
in the numerator.
Because sin A cannot be greater than 1, there can be no such angle A—and thus 
no triangle with the given information. An attempt to sketch such a triangle leads 
to the situation shown in Figure 9.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 17.

EXAMPLE 2 
Solving the Ambiguous Case (Two Triangles)
Solve triangle ABC if A = 55.3°, a = 22.8 ft, and b = 24.9 ft.
SOLUTION To begin, use the law of sines to find angle B.
 sin A
a
= sin B
b
 sin 55.3°
22.8
= sin B
24.9
   Substitute the given values.
 sin B = 24.9 sin 55.3°
22.8
   Multiply by 24.9 and rewrite.
 sin B ≈0.8978678
   Use a calculator.
Solve for sin B.
There are two angles B between 0° and 180° that satisfy this condition. Because 
sin B ≈0.8978678, one value of angle B, to the nearest tenth, is
B1 = 63.9°.   Use the inverse sine function.
Supplementary angles have the same sine value, so another possible value of B is
B2 = 180° - 63.9° = 116.1°.
To see whether B2 = 116.1° is a valid possibility, add 116.1° to the measure of A, 
55.3°. Because 116.1° + 55.3° = 171.4°, and this sum is less than 180°, it is a valid 
angle measure for this triangle.
NOTE In the ambiguous case, we are given two sides and an angle  
opposite one of the sides (SSA). For example, suppose b, c, and angle C 
are given. This situation represents the ambiguous case because angle C is 
opposite side c.

■✔ Now Try Exercise 25.
The ambiguous case results in zero, one, or two triangles. The following guide-
lines can be used to determine how many triangles there are.
Number of Triangles Satisfying the Ambiguous Case (SSA)
Let sides a and b and angle A be given in triangle ABC. (The law of sines 
can be used to calculate the value of sin B.)
1. If applying the law of sines results in an equation having sin B 7 1, then 
no triangle satisfies the given conditions.
2. If sin B = 1, then one triangle satisfies the given conditions and B = 90°.
3. If 0 6 sin B 6 1, then either one or two triangles satisfy the given  
conditions.
 
(a)  If sin B = k, then let B1 = sin-1 k and use B1 for B in the first triangle.
 
(b)  Let B2 = 180° - B1. If A + B2 6 180°, then a second triangle exists. 
In this case, use B2 for B in the second triangle.

7.2 The Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines

10.7
   Multiply by 7.2.
 sin C ≈0.46319186    Use a calculator.
 C ≈27.6°
   Use the inverse sine function.
There is another angle C that has sine value 0.46319186. It is
C = 180° - 27.6° = 152.4°.
However, notice in the given information that c 6 a, meaning that in the tri-
angle, angle C must have measure less than angle A. Notice also that when we 
add this obtuse value to the given angle A = 43.5°, we obtain
152.4° + 43.5° = 195.9°,
which is greater than 180°. Thus either of these approaches shows that there can 
be only one triangle. See Figure 11. The measure of angle B can be found next.
 B = 180° - 27.6° - 43.5°   Substitute.
 B = 108.9°
   Subtract.

EXAMPLE 4 
Analyzing Data Involving an Obtuse Angle
Without using the law of sines, explain why A = 104°, a = 26.8 m, and 
b = 31.3 m cannot be valid for a triangle ABC.
SOLUTION Because A is an obtuse angle, it is the largest angle, and so the 
longest side of the triangle must be a. However, we are given b 7 a.
Thus, B 7 A, which is impossible if A is obtuse.
Therefore, no such triangle ABC exists.

Colors of the U.S. Flag The flag of the United States includes the colors red, white, 
and blue.
Which color is predominant?
Clearly the answer is either red or white. (It can be shown that only 18.73% of the 
total area is blue.) (Source: Banks, R., Slicing Pizzas, Racing Turtles, and Further 
Adventures in Applied Mathematics, Princeton University Press.)
To answer this question, work Exercises 41– 44 in order.
41. Let R denote the radius of the circumscribing circle of a five-pointed star ap-
pearing on the American flag. The star can be decomposed into ten congruent 
triangles. In the figure, r is the radius of the circumscribing circle of the penta-
gon in the interior of the star. Show that the area of a star is

42. Angles A and B have values 18° and 36°, respectively. Express the area 풜 of a star 
in terms of its radius, R.
43. To determine whether red or white is predominant, we must know the measure-
ments of the flag. Consider a flag of width 10 in., length 19 in., length of each 
upper stripe 11.4 in., and radius R of the circumscribing circle of each star 
0.308 in. The thirteen stripes consist of six matching pairs of red and white 
stripes and one additional red, upper stripe. Therefore, we must compare the 
area of a red, upper stripe with the total area of the 50 white stars.
(a) Compute the area of the red, upper stripe.
(b) Compute the total area of the 50 white stars.
44. Which color occupies the greatest area on the flag?

The Law of Cosines
If we are given two sides and the included angle (Case 3) or three sides (Case 4) 
of a triangle, then a unique triangle is determined. These are the SAS and SSS 
cases, respectively. Both require using the law of cosines to solve the triangle.
The following property is important when applying the law of cosines.

of Cosines

Triangle Side Length Restriction
In any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than 
the length of the remaining side.

313
7.3 The Law of Cosines
As an  example of this property, it would be impossible to construct a tri-
angle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and 10. See Figure 12.
a = 3
c = 10
b = 4
No triangle is formed.
Figure 12
Law of Cosines
In any triangle ABC, with sides a, b, and c, the following hold.
 a2 = b2 + c2 −2bc cos A
 b2 = a2 + c2 −2ac cos B
 c2 = a2 + b2 −2ab cos C
That is, according to the law of cosines, the square of a side of a triangle is 
equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, minus twice the product 
of those two sides and the cosine of the angle included between them.
Derivation of the Law of Cosines 
 To derive the law of cosines, let ABC 
be any oblique triangle. Choose a coordinate system so that vertex B is at the origin 
and side BC is along the positive x-axis. See Figure 13.
Let 1x, y2 be the coordinates of vertex A of the triangle. Then the following 
are true for angle B, whether obtuse or acute.
 sin B = y
c 
 and  cos B = x
c
  Definition of sine and cosine
 y = c sin B  and 
 x = c cos B   Here x is negative when B  
is obtuse.
Thus, the coordinates of point A become 1c cos B, c sin B2.
Point C in Figure 13 has coordinates 1a, 02, AC has length b, and point A 
has coordinates 1c cos B, c sin B2. We can use the distance formula to write an 
equation.
 b = 21c cos B - a22 + 1c sin B - 022
  d = 21x2 - x122 + 1y2 - y122
 b2 = 1c cos B - a22 + 1c sin B22
  Square each side.
 b2 = 1c2 cos2 B - 2ac cos B + a22 + c2 sin2 B   Multiply;  
1x - y22 = x2 - 2xy + y2
 b2 = a2 + c21cos2 B + sin2 B2 - 2ac cos B
  Properties of real numbers
 b2 = a2 + c2112 - 2ac cos B
  Fundamental identity
 b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos B
  Law of cosines
This result is one of three possible forms of the law of cosines. In our work, we 
could just as easily have placed vertex A or C at the origin. This would have 
given the same result, but with the variables rearranged.

Solutions of SAS and SSS Triangles (Cases 3 and 4)
NOTE If we let C = 90° in the third form of the law of cosines, then 
cos C = cos 90° = 0, and the formula becomes
c2 = a2 + b2.   Pythagorean theorem
The Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the law of cosines.
EXAMPLE 1 
Applying the Law of Cosines (SAS)
A surveyor wishes to find the distance between two inaccessible points A and B 
on opposite sides of a lake. While standing at point C, she finds that b = 259 m, 
a = 423 m, and angle ACB measures 132° 40′. Find the distance c. See Figure 14.
SOLUTION We can use the law of cosines here because we know the lengths 
of two sides of the triangle and the measure of the included angle.
 c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos C
   Law of cosines
 c2 = 4232 + 2592 - 21423212592 cos 132° 40′   Substitute.
 c2 ≈394,510.6
   Use a calculator.

EXAMPLE 2 
Applying the Law of Cosines (SAS)
Solve triangle ABC if A = 42.3°, b = 12.9 m, and c = 15.4 m.
SOLUTION See Figure 15. We start by finding side a with the law of cosines.
 a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos A
 
Law of cosines
 a2 = 12.92 + 15.42 - 2112.92115.42 cos 42.3° 
Substitute.
 a2 ≈109.7
 
Use a calculator.
 a ≈10.47 m
 
 Take square roots and  
choose the positive root.
Of the two remaining angles B and C, B must be the smaller because it is oppo-
site the shorter of the two sides b and c. Therefore, B cannot be obtuse.

The easiest way to find C is to subtract the measures of A and B from 180°.
 C = 180° - A - B
   Angle sum formula, solved for C
 C ≈180° - 42.3° - 56.0°   Substitute.

7.3 The Law of Cosines
CAUTION Had we used the law of sines to find C rather than B in  
Example 2, we would not have known whether C was equal to 81.7° or to 
its supplement, 98.3°.
EXAMPLE 3 
Applying the Law of Cosines (SSS)
Solve triangle ABC if a = 9.47 ft, b = 15.9 ft, and c = 21.1 ft.
SOLUTION We can use the law of cosines to solve for any angle of the triangle. 
We solve for C, the largest angle. We will know that C is obtuse if cos C 6 0.
 c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos C    Law of cosines
 cos C = a2 + b2 - c2
2ab
   Solve for cos C.
 cos C = 9.472 + 15.92 - 21.12
219.472115.92
   Substitute.
 cos C ≈-0.34109402
   Use a calculator.
 C ≈109.9°
   Use the inverse cosine function.
Now use the law of sines to find angle B.

   Multiply by 15.9.
 B ≈45.1°
   Use the inverse sine function.
Since A = 180° - B - C, we have A ≈180° - 45.1° - 109.9° ≈25.0°.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 23.
Trusses are frequently used to support roofs on buildings, as illustrated in 
Figure 16. The simplest type of roof truss is a triangle, as shown in Figure 17.

CHAPTER 7 Applications of Trigonometry and Vectors
Four possible cases can occur when we solve an oblique triangle. They are 
summarized in the following table. In all four cases, it is assumed that the given 
information actually produces a triangle.
Four Cases for Solving Oblique Triangles
Oblique Triangle
Suggested Procedure for Solving
Case 1:  One side and two angles 
are known.  
(SAA or ASA)
Step 1  Find the remaining angle using the angle 
sum formula 1A + B + C = 180°2.
Step 2  Find the remaining sides using the law of 
sines.
Case 2:  Two sides and one angle  
(not included between 
the two sides) are 
known.  
(SSA)
This is the ambiguous case. There may be no 
triangle, one triangle, or two triangles.
Step 1  Find an angle using the law of sines.
Step 2  Find the remaining angle using the angle 
sum formula.
Step 3  Find the remaining side using the law of 
sines.
If two triangles exist, repeat Steps 2 and 3.
Case 3:  Two sides and the 
included angle are 
known.  
(SAS)
Step 1  Find the third side using the law of 
cosines.
Step 2  Find the smaller of the two remaining 
angles using the law of sines.
Step 3  Find the remaining angle using the angle 
sum formula.
Case 4:  Three sides are known. 
(SSS)
Step 1  Find the largest angle using the law of 
cosines.
Step 2  Find either remaining angle using the law 
of sines.
Step 3  Find the remaining angle using the angle 
sum formula.
Heron of Alexandria (c. 62 CE)
Heron (also called Hero), a Greek  
geometer and inventor, produced  
writings that contain knowledge of  
the mathematics and engineering 
of Babylonia, ancient Egypt, and 
the Greco-Roman world.
Heron’s Area Formula (SSS)
If a triangle has sides of lengths a, b, and c, with semiperimeter
s = 1
2 1a + b + c2,
then the area 풜 of the triangle is given by the following formula.
풜= !s1s −a2 1s −b2 1s −c2 
That is, according to Heron’s formula, the area of a triangle is the square 
root of the product of four factors: (1) the semiperimeter, (2) the semiperimeter 
minus the first side, (3) the semiperimeter minus the second side, and (4) the 
semiperimeter minus the third side.
Heron’s Formula for the Area of a Triangle 
 A formula for finding the 
area of a triangle given the lengths of the three sides, known as Heron’s for-
mula, is named after the Greek mathematician Heron of Alexandria. It is found 
in his work Metrica. Heron’s formula can be used for the case SSS.

Using Heron’s Formula to Find an Area (SSS)
The distance “as the crow flies” from Los Angeles to New York is 2451 mi, 
from New York to Montreal is 331 mi, and from Montreal to Los Angeles is 
2427 mi. What is the area of the triangular region having these three cities as 
vertices? (Ignore the curvature of Earth.)

Don’t forget the 
factor s.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 73.
Derivation of Heron’s Formula  A trigonometric derivation of Heron’s 
formula illustrates some ingenious manipulation.
Let triangle ABC have sides of lengths a, b, and c. Apply the law of cosines.
 
 a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos A

Geometrically Defined Vectors and Applications
Basic Terminology 
 Quantities that involve magnitudes, such as 45 lb or 
60 mph, can be represented by real numbers called scalars. Other quantities, 
called vector quantities, involve both magnitude and direction. Typical vector 
quantities are velocity, acceleration, and force. For example, traveling 50 mph 
east represents a vector quantity.
A vector quantity can be represented with a directed line segment (a seg-
ment that uses an arrowhead to indicate direction) called a vector. The length of 
the vector represents the magnitude of the vector quantity. The direction of the 
vector, indicated by the arrowhead, represents the direction of the quantity. See 
Figure 19.

Vectors may be named with two uppercase 
letters or with one lowercase or uppercase 
letter.
Figure 20
When we indicate vectors in print, it is customary to use boldface type or an 
arrow over the letter or letters. Thus, OP and OP>
 both represent the vector OP. 
When two letters name a vector, the first indicates the initial point and the second 
indicates the terminal point of the vector. Knowing these points gives the direc-
tion of the vector. For example, vectors OP and PO in Figure 20 are not the same 
vector. They have the same magnitude but opposite directions. The magnitude of 
vector OP is written ∣OP∣.

327
7.4 Geometrically Defined Vectors and Applications
Two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same direction and the 
same magnitude. In Figure 21, vectors A and B are equal, as are vectors C and 
D. As Figure 21 shows, equal vectors need not coincide, but they must be paral-
lel and in the same direction. Vectors A and E are unequal because they do not 
have the same direction, while A ≠F because they have different magnitudes.
A
B
C
D
E

Figure 21
The sum of two vectors is also a vector. There are two ways to find the sum 
of two vectors A and B geometrically.
1. Place the initial point of vector B at the terminal point of vector A, as 
shown in Figure 22(a). The vector with the same initial point as A and the 
same terminal point as B is the sum A + B.
2. Use the parallelogram rule. Place vectors A and B so that their initial 
points coincide, as in Figure 22(b). Then, complete a parallelogram that 
has A and B as two sides. The diagonal of the parallelogram with the same 
initial point as A and B is the sum A + B.
Parallelograms can be used to show that vector B + A is the same as vec-
tor A + B, or that A + B = B + A, so vector addition is commutative. The 
vector sum A + B is the resultant of vectors A and B.
For every vector v there is a vector -v that has the same magnitude as v 
but opposite direction. Vector -v is the opposite of v. See Figure 23. The sum 
of v and -v has magnitude 0 and is the zero vector. As with real numbers, to 
subtract vector B from vector A, find the vector sum A + 1-B2. See Figure 24.

The product of a real number (or scalar) k and a vector u is the vector k # u, 
which has magnitude +k + times the magnitude of u. The vector k # u has the same 
direction as u if k 7 0 and the opposite direction if k 6 0. See Figure 25.
The following properties are helpful when solving vector applications.
Geometric Properties of Parallelograms
1. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel.
2. The opposite sides and opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal, and 
adjacent angles of a parallelogram are supplementary.
3. The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, but they do not nec-
essarily bisect the angles of the parallelogram.

CHAPTER 7 Applications of Trigonometry and Vectors
EXAMPLE 1 
Finding the Magnitude of a Resultant
Two forces of 15 and 22 newtons act on a point in the plane. (A newton is a unit 
of force that equals 0.225 lb.) If the angle between the forces is 100°, find the 
magnitude of the resultant force.
SOLUTION As shown in Figure 26, a parallelogram 
that has the forces as adjacent sides can be formed. The 
angles of the parallelogram adjacent to angle P measure 
80° because adjacent angles of a parallelogram are supple-
mentary. Opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal in 
length. The resultant force divides the parallelogram into 
two triangles. Use the law of cosines with either triangle.

The Equilibrant 
 The previous example showed a method for finding the 
resultant of two vectors. Sometimes it is necessary to find a vector that will 
counterbalance the resultant. This opposite vector is the equilibrant. That is, the 
equilibrant of vector u is the vector -u.
EXAMPLE 2 
Finding the Magnitude and Direction of an Equilibrant
Find the magnitude of the equilibrant of forces of 48 newtons and 60 newtons 
acting on a point A, if the angle between the forces is 50°. Then find the angle

■✔ Now Try Exercise 31.
Incline Applications 
 We can use vectors to solve incline problems.
EXAMPLE 3 
Finding a Required Force
Find the force required to keep a 50-lb wagon from sliding down a ramp inclined 
at 20° to the horizontal. (Assume there is no friction.)
SOLUTION In Figure 28, the vertical 50-lb force BA represents the force of 
gravity. It is the sum of vectors BC and -AC. The vector BC represents the 
force with which the weight pushes against the ramp. The vector BF represents 
the force that would pull the weight up the ramp. Because vectors BF and AC 
are equal, +AC+ gives the magnitude of the required force.
Vectors BF and AC are parallel, so angle EBD equals angle A by alternate 
interior angles. Because angle BDE and angle C are right angles, triangles CBA 
and DEB have two corresponding angles equal and, thus, are similar triangles. 
Therefore, angle ABC equals angle E, which is 20°. From right triangle ABC, we 
have the following.

SOLUTION This situation is illustrated in Fig-

angle u, the magnitude of vector BA represents the

which represents the force required to hold the mower

 Problems that involve bearing can also be 
solved using vectors.
EXAMPLE 5 
Applying Vectors to a Navigation Problem
A ship leaves port on a bearing of 28.0° and travels 8.20 mi. The ship then turns 
due east and travels 4.30 mi. How far is the ship from port? What is its bearing 
from port?
SOLUTION In Figure 30, vectors PA and AE 
represent the ship’s path. The magnitude and bear-
ing of the resultant PE can be found as follows. 
Triangle PNA is a right triangle, so
 
 angle NAP = 90° - 28.0° = 62.0°,
and 
 angle PAE = 180° - 62.0° = 118.0°.
Use the law of cosines to find +PE+, the magnitude 
of vector PE.
 +PE+2 = 8.202 + 4.302 - 218.20214.302 cos 118.0° 
Law of cosines
 +PE+2 ≈118.84

To find the bearing of the ship from port, find angle APE.

Finally, 28.0° + 20.4° = 48.4°, so the bearing is 48.4°.

Vector c represents the airspeed and bearing of the plane, vector a repre-

bearing and ground speed of the plane. Angle ABC has as its measure the sum of 
angle ABN1 and angle N1BC.
r Angle SAB measures 239° - 180° = 59°. Because angle ABN1 is an alternate 
interior angle to it, ABN1 = 59°.
r Angle E1BF measures 115° - 90° = 25°. Thus, angle CBW1 also measures 
25° because it is a vertical angle. Angle N1BC is the complement of 25°, which 
is 90° - 25° = 65°.
By these results,
angle ABC = 59° + 65° = 124°.
To find +b+, we use the law of cosines.
 +b+2 = +a+2 + +c +2 - 2+a+ +c + cos ABC

CHAPTER 7 Applications of Trigonometry and Vectors
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
In addition to two-dimensional vectors 
in a plane, calculus courses introduce 
three-dimensional vectors in space. 
The magnitude of the two-dimensional 
vector 8a, b9 is given by
2a2 + b2.
If we extend this to the three- 
dimensional vector 8a, b, c9, the  
expression becomes
2a2 + b2 + c2.
Similar extensions are made for other 
concepts.
 7.5 
Algebraically Defined Vectors and the Dot Product
Algebraic Interpretation of Vectors  A vector 
with initial point at the origin in a rectangular coordi-
nate system is a position vector . A position vector u  
with endpoint at the point 1a, b2 is written 8a, b9, so
u = 8a, b9.
This means that every vector in the real plane cor-
responds to an ordered pair of real numbers. Thus, 
geometrically a vector is a directed line segment while  
algebraically it is an ordered pair. The numbers a 
and b are the horizontal component and the vertical component, respectively, 
of vector u.
Figure 33 shows the vector u = 8a, b9. The positive angle between the 
x-axis and a position vector is the direction angle for the vector. In Figure 33, 
u is the direction angle for vector u. The magnitude and direction angle of  
a vector are related to its horizontal and vertical components.

EXAMPLE 1 
Finding Magnitude and Direction Angle
Find the magnitude and direction angle for u = 83, -29.

32 ≈-33.7°. Adding 360° yields the direction 
angle u ≈326.3°. See Figure 34.
GRAPHING CALCULATOR SOLUTION
The TI-84 Plus calculator can find the magnitude and 
direction angle using rectangular to polar conversion 
(which is covered in detail in the next chapter). An 
approximation for 213 is given, and the TI-84 Plus 
gives the direction angle with the least possible absolute 
value. We must add 360° to the given value -33.7° to 
obtain the positive direction angle u ≈326.3°.

 The dot product of  
two vectors is a real number, not a vector. It is also known as the inner product. 
Dot products are used to determine the angle between two vectors, to derive 
geometric theorems, and to solve physics problems.
Dot Product
The dot product of the two vectors u = 8a, b9 and v = 8c, d9 is denoted 
u # v, read “u dot v,” and given by the following.
u # v = ac + bd
That is, the dot product of two vectors is the sum of the product of their 
first components and the product of their second components.

The dot product of two vectors can be positive, 
0, or negative. A geometric interpretation of the dot 
product explains when each of these cases occurs. 
This interpretation involves the angle between the 
two vectors.
Consider the two vectors u = 8a1, a29 and 
v = 8b1, b29, as shown in Figure 43. The angle U 
between u and v is defined to be the angle having 
the two vectors as its sides for which 0° … u … 180°.

uct of nonzero vectors is positive, 0, or negative according to this table.

Thus, in Example 6, the vectors in part (a) form an 
acute angle, and those in part (b) form a right angle. 
If u # v = 0 for two nonzero vectors u and v, then 
cos u = 0 and u = 90°. Thus, u and v are perpen-
dicular vectors, also called orthogonal vectors.

  Use the inverse sine function.
Another angle with this sine value is

However, 153.5° + 44.5° 7 180°, so there is only one 
triangle.

   Subtract.
Use the law of sines again to solve for b.
b ≈14.8 in.
Ambiguous Case
If we are given the lengths of two sides and the angle oppo-
site one of them (for example, A, a, and b in triangle ABC), 
then it is possible that zero, one, or two such triangles exist. 
If A is acute, h is the altitude from C, and
r 
a 6 h 6 b, then there is no triangle.
r a = h and h 6 b, then there is one triangle  
(a right triangle).
r
a Ú b, then there is one triangle.
r
h 6 a 6 b, then there are two triangles.
If A is obtuse and
r
a … b, then there is no triangle.

Law of Cosines
In any triangle ABC, with sides a, b, and c, the following 
hold.
 a2 = b2 + c2 −2bc cos A
 b2 = a2 + c2 −2  ac cos B

7.3
In triangle ABC, find C if a = 11 units, b = 13 units, and 
c = 20 units. Then find its area.
 c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos C
 
Law of cosines
 202 = 112 + 132 - 211121132 cos C
 
Substitute.
 400 = 121 + 169 - 286 cos C
 
Square and multiply.
 cos C = 400 - 121 - 169

Solve for cos C.

 C ≈113° 
 Use the inverse

The semiperimeter s of the above triangle is

CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers, Polar Equations, and Parametric Equations
Basic Concepts of Complex Numbers 
 There is no real number solution 
of the equation
x2 = −1
because no real number, when squared, gives -1. To extend the real number 
system to include solutions of equations of this type, the number i is defined.

(Part 2)
■ Powers of i
Two complex numbers a + bi and c + di are equal provided that their real 
parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.
The following important concepts apply to a complex number a + bi.
1. If b = 0, then a + bi = a, which is a real number. (This means that the set 
of real numbers is a subset of the set of complex numbers. See Figure 2 on 
the next page.)
2. If b ≠0, then a + bi is a nonreal complex number.
 
Examples: 7 + 2i, -1 - i
3. If a = 0 and b ≠0, then the nonreal complex number is a pure imaginary 
number.
 
Examples: 3i, -16i
The form a + bi (or a + ib) is standard form. (The form a + ib is used to 
write expressions such as i 25 because 25i could be mistaken for 25i .)
Imaginary Unit i
i = !−1, and therefore i2 = −1.
(Note that -i is also a square root of -1.)
Complex Number
If a and b are real numbers, then any number of the form a + bi is a  
complex number. In the complex number a + bi, a is the real part and b is 
the imaginary part.*
*In some texts, the term bi is defined to be the imaginary part.
LOOKING AHEAD TO CALCULUS
The letters j and k are also used to 
represent 2-1 in calculus and some 
applications (electronics, for example).
Square roots of negative numbers were not incorporated into an integrated 
number system until the 16th century. They were then used as solutions of equa-
tions. Today, complex numbers are used extensively in science and engineering.
The calculator is in complex number 
mode. This screen supports the  
definition of i and shows how the  
calculator returns the real and imaginary  
parts of the complex number 7 + 2i.
Figure 1
Equality of Complex Numbers
a + bi = c + di if and only if a = c and b = d.
 Some graphing calculators, such as the TI-84 Plus, are capable of working 
with complex numbers, as seen in Figure 1. ■

CAUTION When working with negative radicands, use the definition 
!−a = i  !a before using any of the other rules for radicals. In par-
ticular, the rule 2c # 2d = 2cd is valid only when c and d are not both  
negative. For example, consider the following.
 2-4 # 2-9 = 2i # 3i = 6i2 = -6
 
Correct
 2-4 # 2-9 = 21-421-92 = 236 = 6 
Incorrect
Operations on Complex Numbers 
 Products or quotients with negative 
radicands are simplified by first rewriting
2-a as i2a, for a positive number a. 
Then the properties of real numbers and the fact that i2 = -1 are applied.

Powers of i 
 Powers of i can be simplified using the facts
i2 = -1 and i4 = 1i222 = 1-122 = 1.
Consider the following powers of i.
i1 = i
  i5 = i4 # i = 1 # i = i
 
i2 = -1
  i6 = i4 # i2 = 11-12 = -1
 
i3 = i2 # i = 1-12 # i = -i   i7 = i4 # i3 = 1 # 1-i2 = -i
i4 = i2 # i2 = 1-121-12 = 1  i8 = i4 # i4 = 1 # 1 = 1 and so on.
Powers of i cycle through the same four outcomes (i, −1, −i, and 1) because 
i4 has the same multiplicative property as 1. It follows that a power of i with 
an exponent that is a multiple of 4 has value 1.

(Modeling) Impedance Impedance is a measure of the opposition to the flow of alter-
nating electrical current found in common electrical outlets. It consists of two parts, 
resistance and reactance. Resistance occurs when a light bulb is turned on, while reac-
tance is produced when electricity passes through a coil of wire like that found in electric 
motors. Impedance Z in ohms 1Ω2 can be expressed as a complex number, where the 
real part represents resistance and the imaginary part represents reactance.
For example, if the resistive part is 3 ohms and the reactive part is 4 ohms, then the 
impedance could be described by the complex number Z = 3 + 4i. In the series circuit 
shown in the figure, the total impedance will be the sum of the individual impedances. 
(Source: Wilcox, G. and C. Hesselberth, Electricity for Engineering Technology, Allyn 
& Bacon.)

light bulbs are pure resistive and the motors are pure reactive, find the total imped-

CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers, Polar Equations, and Parametric Equations
Recall that the sum of the two complex numbers 4 + i and 1 + 3i is
14 + i2 + 11 + 3i2 = 5 + 4i.
Graphically, the sum of two complex numbers is represented by the vector that 
is the resultant of the vectors corresponding to the two numbers. See Figure 4.

Trigonometric (Polar) Form of Complex Numbers
The Complex Plane and Vector Representation 
Unlike real numbers, complex numbers cannot be  
ordered. One way to organize and illustrate them is 
by using a graph in a rectangular coordinate system.
To graph a complex number such as 2 - 3i, we 
modify the coordinate system by calling the horizontal 
axis the real axis and the vertical axis the imaginary 
axis. Then complex numbers can be graphed in this 
complex plane, as shown in Figure 3. Each complex 
number a + bi determines a unique position vector 
with initial point 10, 02 and terminal point 1a, b2.

8.2 Trigonometric (Polar) Form of Complex Numbers
Trigonometric (Polar) Form of a Complex Number
The trigonometric form (or polar form) of the complex number x + yi is
r 1cos U + i sin U2.
The expression cos u + i sin u is sometimes abbreviated cis U. Using this 
notation, r 1cos U + i sin U2 is written r cis U.
The number r is the absolute value (or modulus) of x + yi, and u is the 
argument of x + yi. In this section, we choose the value of u in the interval 
30°, 360°2. Any angle coterminal with u also could serve as the argument.
Converting from Rectangular to Trigonometric Form
Step 1 Sketch a graph of the number x + yi in the complex plane.
Step 2  Find r by using the equation r = 2x2 + y2.
Step 3  Find u by using the equation tan u = y
x , where x ≠0, choosing the 
quadrant indicated in Step 1.
CAUTION Errors often occur in Step 3. Be sure to choose the correct 
quadrant for U by referring to the graph sketched in Step 1.
Converting between Rectangular and Trigonometric (Polar) Forms 
To convert from rectangular form to trigonometric form, we use the following 
procedure.

Note that the real part is positive and the imaginary part 
is negative. This is consistent with 300° being a quad-
rant IV angle. For a 300° angle, the reference angle is  
60°. Thus the function values cos 300° and sin 300° cor-
respond in absolute value to those of cos 60° and sin 60°, 
with the first of these equal to 1
2 and the second equal  
to - 23

that the least positive value for u is 270°.

Converting from Rectangular to Trigonometric Form
Write each complex number in trigonometric form.

(b) -3i (Use degree measure.)
SOLUTION
(a) We start by sketching the graph of - 23 + i in the complex plane, as shown 
in Figure 8. Next, we use x = - 23 and y = 1 to find r and u.
 r = 2x2 + y2 = 4A - 23 B

Deciding Whether a Complex Number Is in the Julia Set
The fractal called the Julia set is shown in Figure 11. To determine whether a 
complex number z = a + bi is in this Julia set, perform the following sequence 
of calculations.
z2 - 1, 1z2 - 122 - 1, 31z2 - 122 - 142 - 1, . . .
If the absolute values of any of the resulting complex numbers exceed 2, then the  
complex number z is not in the Julia set. Otherwise z is part of this set and  
the point 1a, b2 should be shaded in the graph.
Figure 11 
Determine whether each number belongs to the Julia set.
(a) z = 0 + 0i 
(b) z = 1 + 1i
SOLUTION
(a) Here 
 z = 0 + 0i = 0,
 
 z2 - 1 = 0  2 - 1 = -1,
 
 1z2 - 122 - 1 = 1-122 - 1 = 0,
 
 31z2 - 122 - 142 - 1 = 0  2 - 1 = -1,
 and so on.
We see that the calculations repeat as 0, -1, 0, -1, and so on. The absolute 
values are either 0 or 1, which do not exceed 2, so 0 + 0i is in the Julia set 
and the point 10, 02 is part of the graph.
An Application of Complex Numbers to Fractals  At its basic level, a 
fractal is a unique, enchanting geometric figure with an endless self-similarity 
property. A fractal image repeats itself infinitely with ever-decreasing dimensions. 
If we look at smaller and smaller portions, we will continue to see the whole—it is 
much like looking into two parallel mirrors that are facing each other.

CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers, Polar Equations, and Parametric Equations
(b) For z = 1 + 1i, we have the following.
z2 - 1
 = 11 + i22 - 1
 
Substitute for z; 1 + 1i = 1 + i.
 = 11 + 2i + i22 - 1 
 Square the binomial; 
1x + y22 = x2 + 2xy + y2. 
 = -1 + 2i
 
i2 = -1
The absolute value is
21-122 + 22 = 25.
Because 25 is greater than 2, the number 1 + 1i is not in the Julia set and 
11, 12 is not part of the graph.

Products of Complex Numbers in Trigonometric Form 
 Using the 
FOIL method to multiply complex numbers in rectangular form, we find the prod-
uct of 1 + i23 and -223 + 2i as follows.
A1 + i23 B A -223 + 2iB
 = -223 + 2i - 2i132 + 2i223 
FOIL method
 = -223 + 2i - 6i - 223   
i2 = -1
 = -423 - 4i         
Combine like terms.
We can also find this same product by first converting the complex numbers 
1 + i23 and -223 + 2i to trigonometric form.
 
 1 + i23 = 21cos 60° + i sin 60°2
 
 -223 + 2i = 41cos 150° + i sin 150°2
If we multiply the trigonometric forms and use identities for the cosine and 
the sine of the sum of two angles, then the result is as follows.
321cos 60° + i sin 60°24341cos 150° + i sin 150°24

sin1A + B2 = sin  A # cos B + cos A # sin B

The absolute value of the product, 8, is equal to the product of the absolute val-
ues of the factors, 2 # 4. The argument of the product, 210°, is equal to the sum 
of the arguments of the factors, 60° + 150°.

Powers of Complex Numbers (De Moivre’s Theorem) 
 Because raising 
a number to a positive integer power is a repeated application of the product  
rule, it would seem likely that a theorem for finding powers of complex numbers 
exists. Consider the following.

8.4 De Moivre’s Theorem; Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers 
Roots of Complex Numbers 
 Every nonzero complex number has exactly 
n distinct complex nth roots. De Moivre’s theorem can be extended to find all nth 
roots of a complex number.
To find the three complex cube roots of 81cos 135° + i sin 135°2, for example, 
look for a complex number, say r 1cos a + i sin a2, that will satisfy
3r 1cos a + i sin a243 = 81cos 135° + i sin 135°2.
By De Moivre’s theorem, this equation becomes
r31cos 3a + i sin 3a2 = 81cos 135° + i sin 135°2.
Set r3 = 8 and cos 3a + i sin 3a = cos 135° + i sin 135°, to satisfy this equa-
tion. The first of these conditions implies that r = 2, and the second implies that
cos 3a = cos 135° and sin 3a = sin 135°.
For these equations to be satisfied, 3a must represent an angle that is 
coterminal with 135°. Therefore, we must have
 
 3a = 135° + 360° # k, k any integer
or 
 a = 135° + 360° # k
3
 , k any integer.
Now, let k take on the integer values 0, 1, and 2.
If k = 0, then a = 135° + 360° # 0
3
= 45°.
If k = 1, then a = 135° + 360° # 1
3
= 495°
3
= 165°.
If k = 2, then a = 135° + 360° # 2
3
= 855°
3
= 285°.
In the same way, a = 405° when k = 3. But note that 405° = 45° + 360°, so 
sin 405° = sin 45° and cos 405° = cos 45°. Similarly, if k = 4, then a = 525°, 
which has the same sine and cosine values as 165°. Continuing with larger val-
ues of k would repeat solutions already found. Therefore, all of the cube roots 
(three of them) can be found by letting k = 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
When k = 0, the root is 21cos 45° + i sin 45°2.
When k = 1, the root is 21cos 165° + i sin 165°2.
When k = 2, the root is 21cos 285° + i sin 285°2.
In summary, we see that 21cos 45° + i sin 45°2, 21cos 165° + i sin 165°2, and 
21cos 285° + i sin 285°2 are the three cube roots of 81cos 135° + i sin 135°2.

complex number x + yi if the following holds.

8.4 De Moivre’s Theorem; Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers 
Because there are four fourth roots, let k = 0, 1, 2, and 3.
If k = 0, then a = 30° + 90° # 0 = 30°.
If k = 1, then a = 30° + 90° # 1 = 120°.
If k = 2, then a = 30° + 90° # 2 = 210°.
If k = 3, then a = 30° + 90° # 3 = 300°.
Using these angles, the fourth roots are
2 cis 30°, 2 cis 120°, 2 cis 210°, and 2 cis 300°.
These four roots can be written in rectangular form as
23 + i, 
-1 + i23, 
- 23 - i, and 1 - i23.
The graphs of these roots lie on a circle with center at the origin and radius 2. 
See Figure 12. The roots are equally spaced about the circle, 90° apart. (For con-
venience, we label the real axis x and the imaginary axis y.)

Polar Equations and Graphs
Polar Coordinate System 
 Previously we have used the rectangular coor-
dinate system to graph points and equations. In the rectangular coordinate system,  
each point in the plane is specified by giving two numbers 1x, y2. These repre-
sent the directed distances from a pair of perpendicular axes, the x-axis and 
the y-axis.
Now we consider the polar coordinate system which is based on a point, 
called the pole, and a ray, called the polar axis. The polar axis is usually drawn 
in the direction of the positive x-axis, as shown in Figure 14.

CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers, Polar Equations, and Parametric Equations
In Figure 15 the pole has been placed at the origin of a rectangular coordi-
nate system so that the polar axis coincides with the positive x-axis. Point P has 
rectangular coordinates 1x, y2. Point P can also be located by giving the directed 
angle u from the positive x-axis to ray OP and the directed distance r from the 
pole to point P. The ordered pair 1r, u2 gives the polar coordinates of point P. 
If r 7 0 then point P lies on the terminal side of u, and if r 6 0 then point P lies 
on the ray pointing in the opposite direction of the terminal side of u, a distance 
(r ( from the pole.

 An equation in the variables x and y is a

Plotting these points in order gives the graph of a four-leaved rose. Note in Fig-
ure 26(a) how the graph is developed with a continuous curve, beginning with 
the upper half of the right horizontal leaf and ending with the lower half of that 
leaf. As the graph is traced, the curve goes through the pole four times. This can 
be seen as a calculator graphs the curve. See Figure 26(b).

EXAMPLE 6 
Graphing a Polar Equation (Lemniscate)
Graph r2 = cos 2u.
ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION
Complete a table of ordered pairs, and sketch the graph, as 
in Figure 27. The point 1-1, 0°2, with r negative, may be 
plotted as 11, 180°2. Also, 1-0.7, 30°2 may be plotted as 
10.7, 210°2, and so on.
Values of u for 45° 6 u 6 135° are not included in the 
table because the corresponding values of cos 2u are negative 
(quadrants II and III) and so do not have real square roots. 
Values of u greater than 180° give 2u greater than 360° and 
would repeat the points already found. This curve is called  
a lemniscate.
GRAPHING CALCULATOR SOLUTION
To graph r2 = cos 2u with a graphing calculator, 
first solve for r by considering both square roots. 
Enter the two polar equations as
r1 = 2cos 2u and r2 = - 2cos 2u.

Parametric Equations, Graphs, and Applications
Basic Concepts 
 We have graphed sets of ordered pairs that correspond 
to a function of the form y = ƒ1x2 or r = g1u2. Another way to determine a set 
of ordered pairs involves the equations x = ƒ1t2 and y = g1t2, where t is a real 
number in an interval I. Each value of t leads to a corresponding x-value and a 
corresponding y-value, and thus to an ordered pair 1x, y2.

Parametric Equations of a Plane Curve
A plane curve is a set of points 1x, y2 such that x = ƒ1t2, y = g1t2, and  
ƒ and g are both defined on an interval I. The equations x = ƒ1t2 and y = g1t2 
are parametric equations with parameter t. 
 Graphing calculators are capable of graphing plane curves defined by 
parametric equations. The calculator must be set to parametric mode. ■

to solve either equation for t. Instead, we use the fact that sin2 t + cos2 t = 1 to 
apply another approach.

ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION
There is no simple way to find a rectangular equation for the 
cycloid from its parametric equations. Instead, begin with a  
table using selected values for t in 30, 2p4. Approximate 
values have been rounded as necessary.

The Cycloid 
 The cycloid is a special case of the trochoid—a curve traced 
out by a point at a given distance from the center of a circle as the circle rolls 
along a straight line. If the given point is on the circumference of the circle, 
then the path traced as the circle rolls along a straight line is a cycloid, which is  
defined parametrically as follows.
x = at −a sin t, 
y = a −a cos t,  for t in 1 −H, H2
Other curves related to trochoids are hypotrochoids and epitrochoids, 
which are traced out by a point that is a given distance from the center of a 
circle that rolls not on a straight line, but on the inside or outside, respectively, 
of another circle. The classic Spirograph toy can be used to draw these curves.

8.6 Parametric Equations, Graphs, and Applications
The cycloid has an interesting physical property. If a flexible cord or wire 
goes through points P and Q as in   Figure 37, and a bead is allowed to slide due 
to the force of gravity without friction along this path from P to Q, the path that 
requires the shortest time takes the shape of the graph of an inverted cycloid.

Applications of Parametric Equations 
 Parametric equations are used 
to simulate motion. If an object is thrown with a velocity of v feet per second at 
an angle u with the horizontal, then its flight can be modeled by
x = 1v cos U2t and 
y = 1v sin U2t −16  t2 + h,
where t is in seconds and h is the object’s initial height in feet above the ground. 
Here, x gives the horizontal position information and y gives the vertical posi-
tion information. The term -16t2 occurs because gravity is pulling downward. 
See Figure 38. These equations ignore air resistance.

EXAMPLE 6 
 Simulating Motion with Parametric Equations
Three golf balls are hit simultaneously into the air at 132 ft per sec (90 mph) at 
angles of 30°, 50°, and 70° with the horizontal.
(a) Assuming the ground is level, determine graphically which ball travels the 
greatest distance. Estimate this distance.
(b) Which ball reaches the greatest height? Estimate this height.
SOLUTION
(a) Use the following parametric equations to model the flight of the golf balls.
x = 1v cos u2t and y = 1v sin u2t - 16t2 + h
Write three sets of parametric equations.
x1 = 1132 cos 30°2t, y1 = 1132 sin 30°2t - 16t2
x2 = 1132 cos 50°2t, y2 = 1132 sin 50°2t - 16t2
x3 = 1132 cos 70°2t, y3 = 1132 sin 70°2t - 16t2
The graphs of the three sets of parametric equations are shown in Figure 39(a), 
where 0 … t … 3. From the graph in Figure 39(b), where 0 … t … 9, we see 
that the ball hit at 50° travels the greatest distance. Using the tracing feature of 
the TI-84 Plus calculator, we find that this distance is about 540 ft.
(b) Again, use the tracing feature to find that the ball hit at 70° reaches the great-
est height, about 240 ft.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 43.
Substitute h = 0,  
v = 132 ft per sec, and  
u = 30°, 50°, and 70°.

CHAPTER 8 Complex Numbers, Polar Equations, and Parametric Equations
 A TI-84 Plus calculator allows us to view the graphing of more than one 
equation either sequentially or simultaneously. By choosing the latter, the three 
golf balls in Figure 39 can be viewed in flight at the same time. ■
EXAMPLE 7 
Examining Parametric Equations of Flight
Jack launches a small rocket from a table that is 3.36 ft above the ground. Its 
initial velocity is 64 ft per sec, and it is launched at an angle of 30° with respect 
to the ground. Find the rectangular equation that models its path. What type of 
path does the rocket follow?
SOLUTION The path of the rocket is defined by the parametric equations
x = 164 cos 30°2t and y = 164 sin 30°2t - 16t2 + 3.36
or, equivalently,  x = 3223 t and y = -16t2 + 32t + 3.36.
From x = 3223 t, we solve for t to obtain
t =
x
3223
 . 
Divide by 3223.
Substituting for t in the other parametric equation yields the following.
 y = -16t2 + 32t + 3.36

Simplify.
This equation defines a parabola. The rocket follows a parabolic path.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 47(a).
ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION
The equation y = -16t2 + 32t + 3.36 tells the vertical position of 
the rocket at time t. We need to determine the positive value of t for  
which y = 0 because this value corresponds to the rocket at ground  
level. This yields
0 = -16t2 + 32t + 3.36.
Using the quadratic formula, the solutions are t = -0.1 or t = 2.1. 
Because t represents time, t = -0.1 is an unacceptable answer. 
Therefore, the flight time is 2.1 sec.
The rocket was in the air for 2.1 sec, so we can use t = 2.1 
and the parametric equation that models the horizontal position, 
x = 3223 t, to obtain
x = 3223 12.12 ≈116.4 ft.
EXAMPLE 8

Basic Terminology of Equations 
 An equation is a statement that two 
expressions are equal.
x + 2 = 9, 11x = 5x + 6x, x2 - 2x - 1 = 0 
Equations
To solve an equation means to find all numbers that make the equation a true 
statement. These numbers are the solutions, or roots, of the equation. A number 
that is a solution of an equation is said to satisfy the equation, and the solutions 
of an equation make up its solution set. Equations with the same solution set are 
equivalent equations. For example,
x = 4, x + 1 = 5, and 6x + 3 = 27 are equivalent equations
because they have the same solution set, 546. However, the equations
x2 = 9 and x = 3 are not equivalent
because the first has solution set 5-3, 36 while the solution set of the second is 536.
One way to solve an equation is to rewrite it as a series of simpler equiva-
lent equations using the addition and multiplication properties of equality. 
Let a, b, and c represent real numbers.
If a = b, then a + c = b + c.
If a = b and c 3 0, then ac = bc.
These properties can be extended: The same number may be subtracted from 
each side of an equation, and each side may be divided by the same nonzero 
number, without changing the solution set.
Linear Equations 
 We use the properties of equality to solve linear 
equations. 
Linear Equation in One Variable
A linear equation in one variable is an equation that can be written in the 
form
ax + b = 0,
where a and b are real numbers and a ≠0.
A linear equation is a first-degree equation because the greatest degree of the 
variable is 1.

Inequalities  An inequality says that one expression is greater than, 
greater than or equal to, less than, or less than or equal to another. As with equa-

Linear Inequality in One Variable
A linear inequality in one variable is an inequality that can be written in

Inequalities are solved with the properties of inequality, which are similar

1. If a * b, then a + c * b + c.
2. If a * b and if c + 0, then ac * bc. 
3. If a * b and if c * 0, then ac + bc. 
Replacing 6 with 7, …, or Ú results in similar properties. (Restrictions on c remain the same.)

that the interval includes all real numbers less than 4. The interval 1-∞, 42 is an 
example of an open interval because the endpoint, 4, is not part of the interval.  
An interval that includes both its endpoints is a closed interval. A square 
bracket indicates that a number is part of an interval, and a parenthesis indicates 
that a number is not part of an interval.
The solution set 1-∞, 42 is graphed in Figure 1.

■ The Rectangular 
Coordinate System
■ Equations in Two 
Variables
■ Circles
The Rectangular Coordinate System  Each real number corresponds to 
a point on a number line. This idea is extended to ordered pairs of real numbers 
by using two perpendicular number lines, one horizontal and one vertical, that 
intersect at their zero-points. The point of intersection is the origin. The horizontal 
line is the x-axis, and the vertical line is the y-axis. See Figure 1.
The x-axis and y-axis together make up a rectangular coordinate system, or 
Cartesian coordinate system (named for one of its coinventors, René Descartes. 
The other coinventor was Pierre de Fermat). The plane into which the coordinate 
system is introduced is the coordinate plane, or xy-plane. See Figure 1. The 
x-axis and y-axis divide the plane into four regions, or quadrants, labeled as 
shown. The points on the x-axis or the y-axis belong to no quadrant.
Each point P in the xy-plane corresponds to a unique ordered pair 1a, b2 
of real numbers. The point P corresponding to the ordered pair 1a, b2 often is 
written P1a, b2 as in Figure 1 and referred to as 
“the point 1a, b2.” 
The numbers a and b are the coordinates of point P.

Equations in Two Variables  Ordered pairs are used to express the solu-
tions of equations in two variables. When an ordered pair represents the solution 
of an equation with the variables x and y, the x-value is written first. For example, 
we say that
11, 22 is a solution of 2x - y = 0.
Substituting 1 for x and 2 for y in the equation gives a true statement.
 2x - y = 0
 2112 - 2 ≟0      Let x = 1 and y = 2.
 0 = 0 ✓    True
To locate on the xy-plane the point corresponding to the ordered pair 13, 42, 
for example, start at the origin, move 3 units in the positive x-direction, and then 
move 4 units in the positive y-direction. See Figure 2. Point A corresponds to the 
ordered pair 13, 42.

APPENDIX B Graphs of Equations
EXAMPLE 1 
Finding Ordered-Pair Solutions of Equations
For each equation, find at least three ordered pairs that are solutions.
(a) y = 4x - 1 
(b) x = 2y - 1 
(c) y = x2 - 4
SOLUTION
(a) Choose any real number for x or y, and substitute in the equation to obtain 
the corresponding value of the other variable. For example, let x = -2 and 
then let y = 3.
 y = 4x - 1
 y = 41-22 - 1 
Let x = -2.
 y = -8 - 1
 
Multiply.
 y = -9
 
Subtract.
 y = 4x - 1
 3 = 4x - 1 
Let y = 3.
 4 = 4x
 
Add 1.
 1 = x
 
Divide by 4.
 
This gives the ordered pairs 1-2, -92 and 11, 32. Verify that the ordered 
pair 10, -12 is also a solution.
(b)  
 x = 2y - 1   Given equation
 
 1 = 2y - 1   Let x = 1.
 
 1 = y - 1
   Square each side.
 
 2 = y
   Add 1.
 
One ordered pair is 11, 22. Verify that the ordered pairs 10, 12 and 12, 52 are 
also solutions of the equation.
(c) A table provides an organized method for determining ordered pairs. Here, 
we let x equal -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 in 
y = x2 - 4 
and determine the corresponding y-values.

Five ordered pairs are 1-2, 02, 1-1, -32, 10, -42, (1, -32, and 12, 02.
■✔ Now Try Exercises 15(a), 19(a), and 21(a).
The graph of an equation is found by plotting 
ordered pairs that are solutions of the equation. The 
intercepts of the graph are good points to plot first. 
An x-intercept is a point where the graph intersects 
the x-axis, and a y-intercept is a point where the graph 
intersects the y-axis. In other words, the x-intercept is 
represented by an ordered pair with y-coordinate 0, 
and the y-intercept is represented by an ordered pair 
with x-coordinate 0.
A general algebraic approach for graphing an equation using intercepts and 
point-plotting follows.

Step 4 Join the points plotted in Step 3 with a straight line. This line, also

define them as ordered pairs, such as A1
4 , 0B and 10, -12.
EXAMPLE 2 
Graphing Equations
Graph each of the equations here, from Example 1.
(a) y = 4x - 1 
(b) x = 2y - 1 
(c) y = x2 - 4
SOLUTION
(a) Step 1 Let y = 0 to find the x-intercept, and let x = 0 to find the y-intercept.
 
 The intercepts are A1
4 , 0B and 10, -12.*
 y = 4x - 1
 0 = 4x - 1   Let y = 0.
 1 = 4x

4 = x
 y = 4x - 1
 y = 4102 - 1   Let x = 0.
 y = 0 - 1

Graphing an Equation by Point Plotting
Step 1 Find the intercepts.
Step 2 Find as many additional ordered pairs as needed.
Step 3 Plot the ordered pairs from Steps 1 and 2.
Step 4 Join the points from Step 3 with a smooth line or curve.
(b) For x = 2y - 1, the y-intercept 10, 12 was found in Example 1(b). Solve
x = 20 - 1   Let y = 0.
 
to find the x-intercept. When y = 0, the quantity under the radical symbol 
is negative, so there is no x-intercept. In fact, y - 1 must be greater than or 
equal to 0, so y must be greater than or equal to 1.
We plot the ordered pairs 10, 12, 11, 22, and 12, 52 from Example 1(b) 
and join the points with a smooth curve as in Figure 4. To confirm the direc-
tion the curve will take as x increases, we find another solution, 13, 102.

Circles  By definition, a circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie a 
given distance from a given point. The given distance is the radius of the circle, 
and the given point is the center.
We can find the equation of a circle from its definition using the distance 
formula. Suppose that the point 1h, k2 is the center and the circle has radius r, 
where r 7 0. Let 1x, y2 represent any point on the circle. See Figure 6.

Relations and Functions  In algebra, we use ordered pairs to represent 
related quantities. For example, 13, $10.502 might indicate that we pay $10.50 for 
3 gallons of gas. The amount we pay depends on the number of gallons pumped, 
so the amount (in dollars) is called the dependent variable, and the number of 
gallons pumped is called the independent variable.
Generalizing, if the value of the second component y depends on the value 
of the first component x, then y is the dependent variable and x is the indepen-
dent variable.

A set of ordered pairs such as 513, 10.502, 18, 28.002, 110, 35.0026 is a 
relation. A  function is a special kind of relation.

Relation and Function
A relation is a set of ordered pairs. A function is a relation in which, for each 
distinct value of the first component of the ordered pairs, there is exactly one 
value of the second component.
EXAMPLE 1 
Deciding Whether Relations Define Functions
Decide whether each relation defines a function.
 F = 511, 22, 1-2, 42, 13, 426
 G = 511, 12, 11, 22, 11, 32, 12, 326
 H = 51-4, 12, 1-2, 12, 1-2, 026
SOLUTION Relation F is a function because for each different x-value there is 
exactly one y-value. We can show this correspondence as follows.
51, -2, 36 
x-values of F
         
52,   4,   46 
y-values of F
As the correspondence below shows, relation G is not a function because 
one first component corresponds to more than one second component.
51, 26 
x-values of G
51, 2, 36 
y-values of G
In relation H the last two ordered pairs have the same x-value paired with 
two different y-values (-2 is paired with both 1 and 0), so H is a relation but not 
a function. In a function, no two ordered pairs can have the same first compo-
nent and different second components.
Different y-values
H = 51-4, 12, 1-2, 12, 1-2, 026   Not a function

Relations and functions can also be expressed as a correspondence or 
mapping from one set to another, as shown in Figure 1 for function F and 
relation H from Example 1. The arrow 
from 1 to 2 indicates that the ordered pair 
11, 22 belongs to F—  each first component 
is paired with exactly one second compo-
nent. In the mapping for relation H, which 
is not a function, the first component -2 is 
paired with two different second compo-
nents, 1 and 0.
Because relations and functions are sets 
of ordered pairs, we can represent them 
using tables and graphs. A table and graph 
for function F are shown in Figure 2.
Finally, we can describe a relation or function using a rule that tells how to 
determine the dependent variable for a specific value of the independent vari-
able. The rule may be given in words: for instance, “the dependent variable is 
twice the independent variable.” Usually the rule is an equation, such as the one 
below.

In a function, there is exactly one value of the dependent variable, the sec-
ond component, for each value of the independent variable, the first component.
Domain and Range
For every relation consisting of a set of ordered pairs 1x, y2, there are two 
important sets of elements.
r The set of all values of the independent variable 1x2 is the domain.
r The set of all values of the dependent variable 1y2 is the range.
SOLUTION
(a) The domain is the set of x-values, 53, 4, 66. The range is the set of y-values, 
5-1, 2, 5, 86. This relation is not a function because the same x-value, 4, is 
paired with two different y-values, 2 and 5.
(b) The domain is 54, 6, 7, -36 and the range is 5100, 200, 3006. This map-
ping defines a function. Each x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value.
EXAMPLE 2 
Finding Domains and Ranges of Relations

is the set of x-values 5-5, 0, 56, and the range is the set of y-values 526. 
The table defines a function because each different x-value corresponds to 
exactly one y-value (even though it is the same y-value).

(b) The x-values of the points on the graph include all numbers between -4 and

The domain is 3 -4, 44. The range is 3 -6, 64.

(d) The arrowheads indicate that the graph extends indefinitely left and right, as

the range includes all numbers greater than or equal to -3, written 3 -3, ∞2.
■✔ Now Try Exercise 19.
Vertical Line Test
If every vertical line intersects the graph of a relation in no more than one 
point, then the relation is a function.
Determining Whether Relations Are Functions  Because each value 
of x leads to only one value of y in a function, any vertical line must intersect the 
graph in at most one point. This is the vertical line test for a function.

The vertical line test is a simple method for identifying a function defined 
by a graph. Deciding whether a relation defined by an equation or an inequality 
is a function, as well as determining the domain and range, is more difficult. The 
next example gives some hints that may help.

432
APPENDIX C Functions
EXAMPLE 5 
Identifying Functions, Domains, and Ranges
Decide whether each relation defines y as a function of x, and give the domain 
and range.
(a) y = x + 4  (b) y = 22x - 1  (c) y2 = x  (d) y =
5
x - 1
SOLUTION
(a) In the defining equation (or rule), y = x + 4, y is always found by adding 4 to x. 
Thus, each value of x corresponds to just one value of y, and the relation defines 
a function. The variable x can represent any real number, so the domain is
5x 'x is a real number6, or 1-∞, ∞2.
 
Because y is always 4 more than x, y also may be any real number, and so the 
range is 1-∞, ∞2.
(b) For any choice of x in the domain of y = 22x - 1, there is exactly one cor-
responding value for y (the radical is a nonnegative number), so this equation 
defines a function. The equation involves a square root, so the quantity under 
the radical sign cannot be negative.
 2x - 1 Ú 0   Solve the inequality.
 2x Ú 1   Add 1.
 x Ú 1
2
   Divide by 2.
 
The domain of the function is C 1
2 , ∞B. Because the radical must represent a 
nonnegative number, as x takes values greater than or equal to 1
2 , the range is 
5y 'y Ú 06, or 30, ∞2. See Figure 4.
(c) The ordered pairs 116, 42 and 116, -42 both satisfy the equation y2 = x. 
There exists at least one value of x —for example, 16—that corresponds to 
two values of y, 4 and -4, so this equation does not define a function.
 
Because x is equal to the square of y, the values of x must always be 
nonnegative. The domain of the relation is 30, ∞2. Any real number can  
be squared, so the range of the relation is 1-∞, ∞2. See Figure 5.
(d) Given any value of x in the domain of
y =
5
x - 1
 ,
 
we find y by subtracting 1 from x, and then dividing the result into 5. This 
process produces exactly one value of y for each value in the domain, so this 
equation defines a function.
 
The domain of y =
5
x - 1 includes all real numbers except those that 
make the denominator 0. We find these numbers by setting the denominator 
equal to 0 and solving for x.
 x - 1 = 0
 x = 1 
Add 1.
 
Thus, the domain includes all real numbers except 1, written as the inter-
val 1-∞, 12 ´ 11, ∞2. Values of y can be positive or negative, but never 0, 
because a fraction cannot equal 0 unless its numerator is 0. Therefore, the 
range is the interval 1-∞, 02 ´ 10, ∞2, as shown in Figure 6.

APPENDIX C Functions
Function Notation  When a function ƒ is defined with a rule or an equation 
using x and y for the independent and dependent variables, we say, “y is a function 
of x” to emphasize that y depends on x. We use the notation
y = ƒ1x2,
called function notation, to express this and read ƒ1x2 as “ƒ of x,” or “ƒ at x.” 
The letter ƒ is the name given to this function.
For example, if y = 3x - 5, we can name the function ƒ and write
ƒ1x2 = 3x - 5.
Note that ƒ1x2 is just another name for the dependent variable y. For example, 
if y = ƒ1x2 = 3x - 5 and x = 2, then we find y, or ƒ122, by replacing x with 2.
 ƒ122 = 3 # 2 - 5   Let x = 2.
 ƒ122 = 1
   Multiply, and then subtract.
The statement “In the function ƒ, if x = 2, then y = 1” represents the ordered 
pair 12, 12 and is abbreviated with function notation as follows.
ƒ122 = 1
The symbol ƒ122 is read “ƒ of 2” or “ƒ at 2.”
Function notation can be illustrated as follows.

EXAMPLE 6 
Using Function Notation
Let ƒ1x2 = -x2 + 5x - 3 and g1x2 = 2x + 3. Find each of the following.
(a) ƒ122 
(b) ƒ1q2 
(c) g1a + 12
SOLUTION
(a)  ƒ1x2 = -x2 + 5x - 3
 ƒ122 = -22 + 5 # 2 - 3   Replace x with 2.
 ƒ122 = -4 + 10 - 3
   Apply the exponent and multiply.
 ƒ122 = 3
   Add and subtract.
 
Thus, ƒ122 = 3, and the ordered pair 12, 32 belongs to ƒ.
(b)  ƒ1x2 = -x2 + 5x - 3
 ƒ1q2 = -q2 + 5q - 3   Replace x with q.
(c) 
 g1x2 = 2x + 3
 g1a + 12 = 21a + 12 + 3   Replace x with a + 1.
 g1a + 12 = 2a + 2 + 3
   Distributive property
 g1a + 12 = 2a + 5

 ƒ132 = 2
   Simplify.
ƒ132 = 2 indicates that the ordered pair 13, 22 belongs to ƒ.
(b) For ƒ = 51-3, 52, 10, 32, 13, 12, 16, -126, we want ƒ132, the y-value of 
the ordered pair where x = 3. As indicated by the ordered pair 13, 12, when 
x = 3, y = 1, so ƒ132 = 1.
(c) In the mapping, repeated in Figure 7, the domain element 3 is paired with 5 
in the range, so ƒ132 = 5.
(d) To evaluate ƒ132 using the graph, find 3 on the x-axis. See Figure 8. Then 
move up until the graph of ƒ is reached. Moving horizontally to the y-axis 
gives 4 for the corresponding y-value. Thus, ƒ132 = 4.

Increasing, Decreasing, and Constant Functions  Informally speak-
ing, a function increases over an open interval of its domain if its graph rises 
from left to right on the interval. It decreases over an open interval of its domain 
if its graph falls from left to right on the interval. It is constant over an open  
interval of its domain if its graph is horizontal on the interval.
For example, consider Figure 9.
r The function increases over the open interval 
1-2, 12 because the y-values continue to get 
larger for x-values in that interval.
r The function is constant over the open inter-
val 11, 42 because the y-values are always 5 
for all x-values there.
r The function decreases over the open interval 
14, 62 because in that interval the y-values 
continuously get smaller.
The intervals refer to the x-values where the 
y-values either increase, decrease, or are con-
stant.
The formal definitions of these concepts follow.

SOLUTION We observe the domain and ask, “What is happening to the y-values 
as the x-values are getting larger?” Moving from left to right on the graph, we 
see the following:
r On the open interval 1-∞, -22, the y-values are decreasing.
r On the open interval 1-2, 12, the y-values are increasing.
r On the open interval 11, ∞2, the y-values are constant (and equal to 8).
Therefore, the function is decreasing on 1-∞, -22, increasing on 1-2, 12, and 
constant on 11, ∞2. 
■✔ Now Try Exercise 65.
NOTE To decide whether a function is increasing, decreasing, or con-
stant over an interval, ask yourself, “What does y do as x goes from left 
to right?” Our definition of increasing, decreasing, and constant function 
behavior applies to open intervals of the domain, not to individual points.

Graphing Techniques
Graphing techniques presented in this section show how to graph functions that 
are defined by altering the equation of a basic function.
■ Stretching and 
Shrinking
■ Reflecting
■ Symmetry
■ Translations
Stretching and Shrinking  We begin by considering how the graphs of 
y = aƒ1x2 and y = ƒ1ax2 compare to the graph of y = ƒ1x2, where a 7 0.
EXAMPLE 1 
Stretching or Shrinking Graphs
Graph each function.
(a) g1x2 = 20 x 0  
(b) h1x2 = 1
2
 0 x 0  
(c) k1x2 = 0 2x 0
SOLUTION
(a) Comparing the tables of values for ƒ1x2 = 0 x 0 and g1x2 = 20 x 0 in Figure 1 on 
the next page, we see that for corresponding x-values, the y-values of g are 
each twice those of ƒ. The graph of ƒ1x2 = 0 x 0  is vertically stretched. The 
graph of g1x2, shown in blue in Figure 1, is narrower than that of ƒ1x2, shown 
in red for comparison.
NOTE Recall from algebra that 'a ' is the absolute 
value of a number a.
∣a∣= b a if a is positive or 0
−a if a is negative
Thus, '2' = '2 ' and ' -2 ' = '2'. 
We use absolute value functions to illustrate many 
of the graphing techniques in this section.

tables of values. See Figure 2.

Vertical Stretching or Shrinking of the Graph of a Function
Suppose that a 7 0. If a point 1x, y2 lies on the graph of y = ƒ1x2, then the 
point 1x, ay2 lies on the graph of y = aƒ1x2.
(a) If a 7 1, then the graph of y = aƒ1x2 is a vertical stretching of the 
graph of y = ƒ1x2.
(b) If 0 6 a 6 1, then the graph of y = aƒ1x2 is a vertical shrinking of the 
graph of y = ƒ1x2.
Figure 3 shows graphical interpretations of vertical stretching and shrinking. 
In both cases, the x-intercepts of the graph remain the same but the y-intercepts 
are affected.

0 2x 0 .
k1x2 = 0 2x 0 = 0 2 0 # 0 x 0 = 20 x 0
 
Therefore, the graph of k1x2 = 0 2x 0 is the same as the graph of g1x2 = 20 x 0 in 
part (a). This is a horizontal shrink of the graph of ƒ1x2 = 0 x 0 . See Figure 1.

APPENDIX D Graphing Techniques
Horizontal Stretching or Shrinking of the Graph of a Function
Suppose that a 7 0. If a point 1x, y2 lies on the graph of y = ƒ1x2, then the 
point A x
a , yB lies on the graph of y = ƒ1ax2.
(a) If 0 6 a 6 1, then the graph of y = ƒ1ax2 is a horizontal stretching of 
the graph of y = ƒ1x2.
(b) If a 7 1, then the graph of y = ƒ1ax2 is a horizontal shrinking of the 
graph of y = ƒ1x2.
Graphs of functions can also be stretched and shrunk horizontally.
See Figure 4 for graphical interpretations of horizontal stretching and 
shrinking. In both cases, the y-intercept remains the same but the x-intercepts 
are affected.

Reflecting  Forming the mirror image of a graph across a line is called 
reflecting the graph across the line.
EXAMPLE 2 
Reflecting Graphs across Axes
Graph each function.
(a) g1x2 = - 2x 
(b) h1x2 = 2-x
SOLUTION
(a) The tables of values for g1x2 = - 2x and ƒ1x2 = 2x are shown with 
their graphs in Figure 5. As the tables suggest, every y-value of the graph of 
g1x2 = - 2x is the negative of the corresponding y-value of ƒ1x2 = 2x. 
This has the effect of reflecting the graph across the x-axis.

we see that corresponding y-values are the same. The graph of h is a reflec-
tion of the graph of ƒ across the y-axis. See Figure 6.

Reflecting across an Axis
The graph of y = −ƒ1x2 is the same as the graph of y = ƒ1x2 reflected 
across the x-axis. (If a point 1x, y2 lies on the graph of y = ƒ1x2, then 
1x, -y2 lies on this reflection.)
The graph of y = ƒ1 −x2 is the same as the graph of y = ƒ1x2 reflected 
across the y-axis. (If a point 1x, y2 lies on the graph of y = ƒ1x2, then 1-x, y2 
lies on this reflection.)
The graphs in Example 2 suggest the following generalizations.
Symmetry  The graph of ƒ shown in Figure 7(a) is cut in half by the y-axis,  
with each half the mirror image of the other half. Such a graph is symmetric with 
respect to the y-axis. In general, for a graph to be symmetric with respect to the 
y-axis, the point 1 −x, y2 must be on the graph whenever the point 1x, y2 is on 
the graph.

Similarly, if the graph in Figure 7(b) were folded in half along the x-axis, 
the portion at the top would exactly match the portion at the bottom. Such a 
graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis. In general, for a graph to be 
symmetric with respect to the x-axis, the point 1x, −y2 must be on the graph 
whenever the point 1x, y2 is on the graph.

Symmetry with Respect to an Axis
The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the y-axis if the 
replacement of x with -x results in an equivalent equation.
The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the x-axis if the 
replacement of y with -y results in an equivalent equation.
EXAMPLE 3 
Testing for Symmetry with Respect to an Axis
Test for symmetry with respect to the x-axis and the y-axis.
(a) y = x2 + 4  (b) x = y2 - 3  (c) x2 + y2 = 16  (d) 2x + y = 4
SOLUTION
(a) In y = x2 + 4, replace x with -x.
 y = x2 + 4
 y = 1-x22 + 4    The result is equivalent to the  
original equation.
 y = x2 + 4
Use parentheses 
around -x.
 
Thus the graph, shown in Figure 8, is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. 
The y-axis cuts the graph in half, with the halves being mirror images.
 
 Now replace y with -y to test for symmetry with respect to the x-axis.
 y = x2 + 4
 -y = x2 + 4
         The result is not equivalent  
to the original equation.
 y = -x2 - 4
Multiply  
by -1.
 
The graph is not symmetric with respect to the x-axis. See Figure 8.
(b) In x = y2 - 3, replace y with -y.
x = 1-y22 - 3 = y2 - 3 
Same as the original equation
 
The graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, as shown in Figure 9. It 
is not symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
(c) Substitute -x for x and then -y for y in x2 + y2 = 16.
1-x22 + y2 = 16 and x2 + 1-y22 = 16
 
Both simplify to the original equation,
x2 + y2 = 16.

Another kind of symmetry occurs when a graph can be rotated 180° about 
the origin, with the result coinciding exactly with the original graph. Symmetry 
of this type is symmetry with respect to the origin. In general, for a graph to 
be symmetric with respect to the origin, the point 1 −x, −y2 is on the graph 
whenever the point 1x, y2 is on the graph.

Symmetry with Respect to the Origin
The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the origin if the

equivalent equation.
 2x + y = 4
 21-x2 + y = 4          Not equivalent
 -2x + y = 4
 2x + y = 4
 2x + 1-y2 = 4          Not equivalent
 2x - y = 4
 
The graph is not symmetric with respect to either axis. See Figure 11.
 
■✔ Now Try Exercise 35.
(d) In 2x + y = 4, replace x with -x and then replace y with -y.
 
The graph, a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin, is symmetric with  
respect to both axes. See Figure 10.
EXAMPLE 4 
Testing for Symmetry with Respect to the Origin
Determine whether the graph of each equation is symmetric with respect to the 
origin.
(a) x2 + y2 = 16 
(b) y = x3
SOLUTION
(a) Replace x with -x and y with -y.
x2 + y2 = 16
1-x22 + 1-y22 = 16         Equivalent
x2 + y2 = 16
Use parentheses 
around -x and -y.
 
The graph, which is the circle shown in Figure 10 in Example 3(c), is sym-
metric with respect to the origin.

Notice the following important concepts regarding symmetry:
r A graph symmetric with respect to both the x- and y-axes is automatically 
symmetric with respect to the origin. (See Figure 10.)
r A graph symmetric with respect to the origin need not be symmetric with 
respect to either axis. (See Figure 13.)
r Of the three types of symmetry—with respect to the x-axis, with respect to 
the y-axis, and with respect to the origin—a graph possessing any two types 
must also exhibit the third type of symmetry.
r A graph symmetric with respect to the x-axis does not represent a function. 
(See Figures 9 and 10.)
Translations  The next examples show the results of horizontal and verti-
cal shifts, or translations, of the graph of ƒ1x2 = 0 x 0 .
EXAMPLE 5 
Translating a Graph Vertically
Graph g1x2 = 0 x 0 - 4.
SOLUTION Comparing the table shown with Figure 14, we see that for corre-
sponding x-values, the y-values of g are each 4 less than those for ƒ. The graph 
of g1x2 = 0 x 0 - 4 is the same as that of ƒ1x2 = 0 x 0 , but translated 4 units down. 
The lowest point is at 10, -42. The graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis 
and is therefore the graph of an even function.

r The graph of g will be the same as the graph of ƒ, but translated c units

Using More Than One Transformation

2
 x2 + 4
SOLUTION
(a) To graph ƒ1x2 = - 0 x + 3 0 + 1, the lowest point on the graph of y = 0 x 0  is 
translated 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. The graph opens down because of 
the negative sign in front of the absolute value expression, making the lowest 
point now the highest point on the graph, as shown in Figure 18. The graph is 
symmetric with respect to the line x = -3.
(b) To determine the horizontal translation, factor out 2.
 h1x2 = 0 2x - 4 0
 h1x2 = 0 21x - 22 0  
Factor out 2.
 h1x2 = 0 2 0 # 0 x - 2 0  
0 ab 0 = 0 a 0 # 0 b 0
 h1x2 = 20 x - 2 0   
0 2 0 = 2
 
The graph of h is the graph of y = 0 x 0  translated 2 units to the right, and 
vertically stretched by a factor of 2. Horizontal shrinking gives the same 
appearance as vertical stretching for this function. See Figure 19.
(c) The graph of g1x2 = -  1
2 x2 + 4 has the same shape as that of y = x2, but it 
is wider (that is, shrunken vertically), reflected across the x-axis because the 
coefficient -  1

Answers to Selected Exercises
To The Student
In this section we provide the answers that we think most 
students will obtain when they work the exercises using the 
methods explained in the text. If your answer does not look 
exactly like the one given here, it is not necessarily wrong. 
In many cases there are equivalent forms of the answer. For 
example, if the answer section shows 3
4 and your answer is 
0.75, you have obtained the correct answer but written it in a 
different (yet equivalent) form. Unless the directions specify 
otherwise, 0.75 is just as valid an answer as 3
4 . (In answers 
with radicals, we give rationalized denominators when 
appropriate.) In general, if your answer does not agree with 
the one given in the text, see whether it can be transformed 
into the other form. If it can, then it is equivalent to the cor-
rect answer. If you still have doubts, talk with your instructor.

result in an angle having tangent equal to 25. The function 
tan-1 is not the reciprocal of the tangent (cotangent) but is,  
rather, the inverse tangent function. To find cot 25°, the 
student must find the reciprocal of tan 25°.

Note to student: Although most of the measures resulting 
from solving triangles in this chapter are approximations, 
for convenience we use = rather than ? in the answers.

27. C = 97° 34′, b = 283.2 m, c = 415.2 m 
29. To use the law of sines, we must know an angle measure, 
the length of the side opposite it, and at least one other angle 
measure or side length. 31. If two angles and a side are 
given, the third angle can be determined using the angle sum 
formula. Then the ASA congruence axiom can be applied. 
This triangle is uniquely determined because there is only one 
possible triangle that meets these initial conditions.

quadrant II, its sine is positive. The function sin u  
decreases on the interval 190°, 180°2 from 1 to 0. 
Therefore, sin 115° is closest to 0.9.

51. sin 10° + sin 10° ≟sin 20°
  Using a calculator, we obtain
 
 sin 10° + sin 10° ≈0.34729636

 sin 20° ≈0.34202014.
Thus, the statement is false.

79.  Intuitively, increasing u would make it easier to  
negotiate the curve at a higher speed, much as is  
done at a race track. Mathematically, a larger value  
of u (acute) will lead to a larger value for tan u.  
If tan u increases, then the ratio determining R will 
decrease. Thus, the radius can be smaller and the curve 
sharper if u is increased.

Chapter 2 Acute Angles and Right Triangles
2.1 Exercises
69.  One point on the line y = 23x is the origin, 10, 02 . 
Let 1x, y2 be any other point on this line. Then, by the  
definition of slope, m =
y - 0
x - 0 =
y
x = 23 , but also, by 
the definition of tangent, tan u =
y
x . Thus, tan u = 23 . 
Because  tan 60° = 23, the line y = 23 x makes a  
60° angle with the positive x-axis.
73.  Apply the relationships among the lengths of the sides 
of a 30°9 60° right triangle first to the triangle on the 
left to find the values of x and y, and then to the triangle 
on the right to find the values of z and w. In a 30°960°

r = 5√2
  Because x = -5 and y = -5,
 
r = 2x2 + y2 = 21-522 + 1-522 = 250 = 522
 
and 
tan u = y
x = -5
-5 = 1.
   For tan u = 1, the reference angle for u is 45°. The 
graph shows that u is in quadrant III, so
u = 180° + 45° = 225°.
  Use these results.

For the numerator, we have
-i = 0 - 1i and r = 202 + 1-122 = 1.
u = 270° because cos 270° = 0 and sin 270° = -1. 
Thus -i = 1 cis 270°.
For the denominator, we have
1 + i = 1 + 1i and r = 212 + 12 = 22
 tan u = y
x = 1
1 = 1.
   Because x and y are both positive, u is in quadrant I and 
u = tan-1 1 = 45°. Thus, 1 + i = 22 cis 45°. Now use
