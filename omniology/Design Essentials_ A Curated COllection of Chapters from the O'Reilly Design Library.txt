■Case Study: Identifying Opportunities: Combining Mental Model 
Diagrams and Jobs to Be Done

In my first book, Designing Web Navigation, I discuss the 
principle of transitional volatility. First described by David 
Danielson in 2003, transitional volatility is the degree of 
reorientation a person experiences when moving from page 
to page in a website. If there is too much volatility, they get 
lost in hyperspace.
Figure 2-1 shows this pattern of interaction. It’s a sequence of 
becoming accustomed to one location (habituate), forming an 
expectation about the next point (predict), and then adjusting 
to a new position (reorient). The pattern then repeats.
We see the same thing happening on a larger scale when 
individuals interact with an organization. Instead of page to 
page, they move from touchpoint to touchpoint. At each in­
teraction there is a reorientation period, even if brief. If there 
is too much reorientation at each touchpoint, the experience 
feels disjointed. 
A high degree of transitional volatility arises from an inconsis­
tency in touchpoints. You’ve probably experienced this your­
self. For instance, I once had an unpleasant incident with my 
credit card. The card issuer and the bank backing it seemed 
to disagree about who was responsible for my problem. Each 
blamed the other, and I got caught in the middle.
My experience spanned months and used various means of 
communication. For some things I used their website; for 
others I had to call. There were emails, regular mail, and even 
a fax. The degree of reorientation at each point was high. Ap­
parently it was my job to figure it all out. Needless to say, they 
no longer have my business and I will not recommend them.
The advice is clear: don’t force people to bridge gaps of your 
offering. That’s your job. Mapping experiences allows you to 
locate transitional volatility within a broader system of interac­
tions and find innovative solutions to address it.

Frame the Mapping Effort
The term experience defies precise definition. Still, we can 
point to some common aspects to better understand it:
Experiences are holistic.
The notion of an experience is by its nature all-encompassing, 
including actions, thoughts, and feelings over time.
Experiences are personal.
An experience is not an objective property of a product or 
service; it’s the subjective perception of the individual.
Experiences are situational.
I like rollercoasters, but not immediately after eating a 
large meal. In one case, the experience is exhilirating; 
in the other, it’s a dreadful few minutes of nausea. The 
rollercoaster didn’t change, the situation did. Experiences 
differ from situation to situation. Circumstance drives 
experience more than disposition.
How, then, do we approach mapping experiences? Put simply, 
it’s a matter of selection. Maps are purposefully focused. 
As the mapmaker, it’s up to you to decide which aspects to 
include and which to leave out. 
Cartographic maps, for instance, are selective in what they 
show. Consider Harry Beck’s famous map of the London 
Underground, first published in 1933 (Figure 2-2). It is sparing 
in what it includes: tube lines, stops, exchanges, and the River 
Thames—nothing more. 
This is not to say, however, that you must design every touch­
point. That would be futile. Some aspects will be beyond your 
control. However, understanding multiple factors that make 
up an experience allows you to determine which parts to 
focus on as well as how to avoid negative experiences, even if 
beyond your control. 
What’s more, the aim isn’t for uniformity across the board. 
Rather, strive for coherency in the conception and design 
of the overall system. Create a balanced perception of your 
organization, but still give people control to shape their own 
experiences. 
Diagrams provide a systematic overview of the experiences you 
create. By fostering conversations across the organization, the 
process of mapping helps avoid negative transitional volatility 
and promote coherency. Regardless of the specific diagram 
type you create, there are overarching aspects to consider in 
mapping experience, covered in this chapter. These include:
1.	 Frame the effort clearly up front. Determine the point of 
view, scope, focus, and structure of the diagram, as well 
as how you intend to use it.
2.	 Identify the various touchpoints in the system, as well as 
critically charged points, called moments of truth.
3.	 Focus on creating value. Use the diagram to improve and 
to innovate your offering and your business.
By the end of this chapter, you should have a greater un­
derstanding of the key decisions you’ll have to make when 
mapping experiences.

Purchasing behavior
One point of view is to look at how readers purchase the 
news magazine: how they first hear of the magazine, why 
they bought it, if they make a repeat purchase, and so 
on. Mapping an experience from this point of view makes 
sense if there is a need to optimize sales. A customer 
journey map would be a good fit.
News consumption
Another point of view might be to look at how readers 
consume news in general. This would situate the mag­
azine within a broader spectrum of human information 
behavior. This point of view could be beneficial if the 
magazine is looking to expand its offering. A mental 
model diagram could be useful in this case.
Day-in-the-life
You could also look at a day-in-the-life of typical readers: 
how does a news magazine fit into their daily actions? 
Where do they come in contact with the magazine? 
When? What else do they do to find and read news? An 
experience map may be appropriate for mapping this 
experience.
Each of these points of view has a different unit of analysis—
purchasing, consuming news, or a daily routine. And each can 
be beneficial depending on the needs of the organization. 
This map also distorts the train lines, relying only on horizon­
tal, vertical, and 45-degree angled lines. Stops are spaced 
equidistantly as well, when in reality the distances vary greatly. 
Beck’s map has remained virtually intact for over 70 years 
with only minor updates. Its brilliance lies in what it doesn’t 
show: streets, buildings, curves in lines, and actual distances 
between stops. The longevity of Beck’s map is given by its 
appropriateness—it fulfills a specific need extremely well. 
Likewise, mapping experiences requires choice: what to 
include and how to represent it. For now, it’s important to 
understand the aspects that frame mapping efforts: point of 
view, scope, focus, structure, and how a diagram will be used.
Point of View
Mapping experiences requires a common thread or a “bounc­
ing ball” to follow. The point of view of a diagram should 
answer the question, what is it about? 
Point of view is given by two criteria: the people involved and 
the types of experiences focused on. For instance, a news 
magazine might serve two distinct audiences: readers and 
advertisers. The interactions each has with the publisher are 
very different. Whose experience you illustrate depends on 
the goals of the organization.  
Once you’ve decided on the people to focus on—assume 
readers in this example—there are different experiences to 
choose from. Consider these three potential experiences for a 
news magazine reader:
22   
Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences

For example, imagine you’ve been contracted by the tourist 
bureau of a city in the US to improve the experience of visiting 
tourists, with a specific goal of 
increasing the mobile services 
offered.
One approach could be to 
scope the entire visit starting 
from planning at home, to visiting the city, and all the way 
to follow-up actions afterwards. This would give you a broad 
picture across different touchpoint types across the entire 
service ecology for multiple stakeholders. 
In another approach, you could limit the effort to only expe­
riences in the city with mobile services. This journey might 
begin and end at the airport or train station, but would 
provide greater depth on mobile touchpoints for a particular 
user type. 
Both approaches are valid depending on the needs of the 
organization, as well as their interests and gaps in knowledge. 
Are you focused on a discrete problem or do you need a view 
of the entire system? The point is to be explicit about the 
tradeoffs you’re making upfront and set the right expecta­
tions. 
Typically, focus a given diagram on single point of view in a 
given diagram. A clear perspective generally strengthens the 
message of a diagram. 
To compare different points of 
view, you could create several 
individual diagrams and display 
them together—for instance, 
by hanging them next to each other on a wall. But it’s also 
entirely possible to include multiple people and multiple ex­
periences within the same diagram. This provides an overview 
of the complete service ecosystem. If you do, just be clear 
about how different points of view come together. In the end, 
it’s the mapmaker’s job to determine which points of view to 
follow. 
Scope
The equally spaced Tube stops on Beck’s map of the London 
Underground allow the entire system to fit on one page. 
Actual spacing would have put the end stations far off the 
page. Given his scope—to show the entire system—this lack 
of fidelity is necessary. 
Scope requires tradeoff in breadth versus depth. A map of an 
end-to-end experience reveals the big picture but leaves out 
detail. On the other hand, a detailed diagram may illustrate 
specific interactions, but cover less ground. Determine the 
boundaries of the experience and the granularity needed to 
tell a complete story. 
As the mapmaker, it’s up to you to 
decide which aspects to include 
and which to leave out.
Frame the Mapping Effort    23

•	 Operations: roles, departments, reporting structures
•	 Metrics: traffic, financials, statistics
•	 Evaluation: strengths, weaknesses, learnings
•	 Opportunities: gaps, weaknesses, redundancies
•	 Goals: revenue, savings, reputation
•	 Strategy: policy, design making, principles
The question of balance of the above elements comes into 
play as well. For instance, a customer journey map may focus 
primarily on an experience with only a minimal description of 
the organization. A service blueprint, on the other hand, may 
highlight the service provision process across channels at the 
expense of a detailed description of the user experience. 
Structure
Alignment diagrams differ in structure. The most common 
scheme is chronological (Figure 2-3a), and many of the exam­
ples in this book have a chronological organization. However, 
other arrangements are possible, including hierarchical, spa­
tial, and network structures (Figures 2-3b, 2-3c, 2-3d).
Focus
The mapmaker also chooses which aspects come to the fore­
ground. There are many types of elements to consider. The 
ones you choose depend on how you’ve framed the effort 
(see Chapter 4 ) and what aspects are most salient to the 
organization.
In describing the individual’s experience you might include 
some of the following typical aspects:
•	 Physical: artifacts, tools, devices
•	 Behavioral: actions, activities, tasks
•	 Cognitive: thoughts, views, opinions
•	 Emotional: feelings, desires, state of mind
•	 Needs: goals, outcomes, jobs to be done 
•	 Challenges: pain points, constraints, barriers 
•	 Context: setting, environment, location
•	 Culture: beliefs, values, philosophy
•	 Events: triggers, moments of truth, points of failure
Elements that describe the organization can include:
•	 Touchpoints: mediums, devices, information
•	 Offering: products, services, features
•	 Processes: activities, workflow
•	 Challenges: problems, issues, breakdowns

Phase 4
FIGURE 2-3a. CHRONOLOGICAL: Because experiences happen in real 
time, a chronological arrangement provides a natural sequence of human 
behavior.  A timeline of some sort is the most prevalent way to structure 
alignment diagrams. See Chapters 9 to 11 on service blueprints, customer 
journey maps, and experience maps for more.
Space
FIGURE 2-3c. SPATIAL: It’s also possible to illustrate experiences spatially. 
This makes sense when interactions take place in a physical location—for 
example, in a face-to-face service encounter. But they can also be 
imposed on an experience in a metaphorical sense: spatial maps represent 
experiences as if they could exist in a 3D space even when they do not. 
Chapter 13 discusses spatial maps in greater detail. 
Hierarchy
FIGURE 2-3b. HIERARCHICAL: Mapping experiences hierarchically 
removes the time dimension. This can have advantages when there 
are many aspects occurring simultaneously, which is difficult to show 
chronologically. Chapter 12 discusses mental model diagrams and other 
hierarchical arrangements.
Network
FIGURE 2-3d. NETWORK STRUCTURE: A network structure shows a web 
of interrelationships between aspects of an experience that are neither 
chronological nor hierarchical.

Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences

Keep in mind that the goal of a mapping effort isn’t to com­
plete an artifact, but to address the challenges the diagrams 
help discover and understand. Diagrams are compelling 
documents that invite engagement by others. Use this to your 
advantage to find ways of solving customer problems and 
creating value. 
Identify Touchpoints
Framing the effort, as outlined above, provides a basis for 
illustrating the overall experience. Within that experience, you 
also need to consider the relationship between individuals and 
an organization. The concept of touchpoints, the means of 
value exchange, allows you to show the interaction between 
the two.
Typically, touchpoints include a range of things, such as:
•	 TV ads, print ads, brochures
•	 Marketing emails, newsletters 
•	 Website, apps, software program
•	 Phone calls, service hotline, online chat
•	 Service counter, checkout register, consulting
•	 Physical objects, buildings, roads
•	 Packaging, shipping materials
•	 Bills, invoices, payment systems
Figure 2-4 is an example of the guest experience of the service 
Booking.com. It’s an excellent example of illustrating an experi­
ence in network-like structure. The focus is on touchpoints that 
lead to positive or negative experiences.
Use
Keep the intended use of an alignment diagram in mind from 
the very beginning. 
First, consider who will be consuming the information in your 
diagram. The London Underground map is read by everyday 
travelers on the Tube. They use it to determine how to travel 
between any two points on the network. But the engineers 
who maintain the switching signals in the London Under­
ground would likely find Beck’s map lacking in detail. They 
need specifications with a much higher degree of fidelity to 
accomplish their work. Beck’s map is not intended for that 
audience. 
Also consider what you’ll use diagrams for. Frame the effort in 
a way that is appropriate for your team’s needs. What ques­
tions does the organization have that a diagram can address? 
What gaps in knowledge does it fill? What problems will it 
help solve?
Finally, ask yourself how the diagram will be used. Will they 
be used to diagnose problems or improve the design of an 
existing system? Will they be used to create a strategy and 
plan for development? Or does your audience intend to use 
the alignment diagram to discover new opportunities for inno­
vation and growth? 
Identify Touchpoints    27

Inventories such as the one in Figure 2-5 are necessary to get 
a comprehensive overview of touchpoints. But some people 
call for a broader perspective. Chris Risdon, for one, defines a 
touchpoint as the context around an interaction. In his article 
“Unsucking the Touchpoint” he writes:
A touchpoint is a point of interaction involving a 
specific human need in a specific time and place.
Jeanie Walters, a leading customer experience consultant, also 
advocates a broader definition. She is critical of touchpoint 
inventories, writing:
The challenge with viewing touchpoints this way is this 
approach often assumes the customer has a) been in a 
linear and direct relationship with the organization and 
b) reads and engages with these touchpoints in mean­
ingful ways. In short, an examination of touchpoints is 
often entirely company-focused. (Sometimes, it is so 
company-focused the touchpoints are categorized by 
org chart: marketing; operations; billing, etc.). 
Historically, there are three primary types of touchpoints:
Static
These touchpoints don’t allow for users to interact with 
them. They include things such as an email newsletter or 
an advertisement.
Interactive
Websites and apps are interactive touchpoints, as are 
online chats.
Human
This type involves human-to-human interaction. Examples 
include a sales representative or a support agent on the 
phone.
Consider the inventory of touchpoints in Figure 2-5. This 
diagram was created by the Swiss-based marketing firm 
Accelerom, an international consultancy and research firm 
based in Zurich (www.accelerom.com), as part of their 360º 
touchpoint management process.* This shows a fairly compre­
hensive list of touchpoints a company has with its customers.
Notice that the touchpoints are grouped by channel in Figure 
2-6—in this case, point of sale, one-to-one, indirect, and mass 
communication. A channel is not a touchpoint but rather a cat­
egory of touchpoint given by the mode of delivery.

touchpoints but also provide an end-to-end picture of the 
experience.
Moments of Truth
Alignment diagrams are not just a collection of touchpoints. 
They also provide insight for identifying and understanding 
critical points in the experience. Called moments of truth, 
these key, emotional instances help focus attention on the 
aspects that matter most.
Moments of truth can be thought of as a special type of 
touchpoint. They are critical, emotionally charged interactions, 
and usually occur when someone has invested a high degree 
of energy in a desired outcome. Moments of truth either 
make or break the relationship. 
The term moments of truth was popularized by Jan Carlzon, 
the then CEO of SAS Airlines, in his book of the same name. 
To illustrate his point, Carlzon starts his book with a story of a 
customer who arrived at the airport without his boarding pass. 
The SAS agents personally drove back to the hotel where he 
left it and delivered it to him at the airport. This left an indelible 
impression on the customer. 
Or, consider something as simple as Twitter’s infamous “fail 
whale.” Now retired, the fail whale was an image of a whale 
(Figure 2-7) that appeared when Twitter servers were over­
loaded. Though disruptive at a critical moment—the point at 
which a person is posting a tweet—many people actually felt 
an emotional connection to the fail whale. Twitter turned a 
potentially negative moment of truth into something positive. 
In Gianluca Brugnoli’s article “Connecting the Dots of User 
Experience,” he offers the touchpoint matrix shown in Figure 
2-6. This diagram illustrates various activities around photog­
raphy. By providing a sequence and locations of interactions, 
Brugnoli provides context for touchpoints in a journey.
Brugnoli believes that the system is the experience. It’s the 
sum of all touchpoints, as well as the connections between 
them. He writes:
The challenge that logically follows is to design con­
nections. In the system scenario, design should be 
mainly focused on finding the right connections within 
the network and its parts, rather than in creating 
closed and self-sufficient systems, tools and services.
Creating value in the 21st century will increasingly involve systems 
of experiences. Touchpoints are the basic building blocks that 
make up the system.
Organizations that take an ecological view on the experiences 
they provide have a competitive advantage. For businesses, this 
impacts the bottom line. One study from 2013 by Alex Rawson 
and colleagues found that optimization across touchpoints was 
a strong predictor of business health.* The researchers found 
a 20% to 30% correlation with improved outcomes, such as 
higher revenue, better retention, and positive word of mouth.
Alignment diagrams reinforce such an ecological view of the 
interaction with customers. They not only illustrate individual 
*	See Alex Rawson, Ewan Duncan, and Conor Jones. “The Truth About Customer 
Experience” Harvard Business Review (Sep 2013).

Moments of truth point to opportunities for innovation and 
growth. For instance, in their book The Innovator’s Method, 
business scholars and consultants Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer 
suggest creating what they call “journey lines,” or a brief visu­
alization of the steps customers take. They write:
Create an in-depth visual portrait in which you identify 
pain points to understand how your customers do the 
job today and how they feel while doing it. Visually 
map out the steps customers take to achieve an out­
come. It helps to assign a customer emotion to each 
step to identify how the customer is feeling. 
They go on to recommend looking for moments “that ignite 
their emotions”—in other words, moments of truth. Solutions 
that address these moments, they claim, are more likely to be 
monetizable: people are generally willing to pay for services 
that address critical needs. In this sense, moments of truth are 
points of opportunity for the organization.
The individual’s perception of an organization is given by 
the sum of all moments of truth. These may be moments of 
delight—positive interaction after positive interaction. On the 
negative side, the relationship may suffer from a “death by a 
thousand cuts.”
Focusing on moments of truth allows you to concentrate your 
energy on experiences that matter. The perceived coherency 
of your offering is given by how you handle moments of truth. 
Diagrams provide insight into these points across time, allow­
ing organizations to design a more cohesive experience and 
reduce transitional volatility.
Creating value in the 21st century 
will increasingly involve systems of 
experiences. Touchpoints are the basic 
building blocks that make up the system.

moment of truth into a potentially delightful experience.

Zero Moment of Truth
Traditionally, there are three main touchpoint types in com­
merce situations.
•	 Stimulus: the very first time customers become aware of 
a given product or service. 
•	 First moment of truth: the decision to buy a product or 
service. 
•	 Second moment of truth: the first experience customers 
have using a product or service. 
More and more, consumers read reviews by other consumers. 
They look at sites like Amazon to inform decisions. Or, they ask 
Twitter followers for opinions. And they look at who’s behind 
a service as well, researching profiles on LinkedIn and even 
Facebook. Regardless of industry or sector, customers are far 
more informed today than just a decade ago.
In addition to the first and second moments of truth, market 
researchers at Google have identified a new critical touchpoint: 
the “Zero Moment of Truth,” or ZMOT for short.* It falls be­
tween the stimulus and the decision to buy (Figure 2-8).
*	Jim Lecinski. ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of Truth (Google, 2011).
Content is critical at the ZMOT. But it can’t come across as 
marketing fluff:  information at the ZMOT touchpoint must be 
meaningful and valuable. Successful companies converse with 
their markets and engage in a dialog. They position themselves 
not as “buy me!” banners, but as trusted advisors. 
Notice that product recommendations feeding into the ZMOT 
come after someone has already used a product. With this, the 
usage experience is now relevant before the purchase decision. 
More importantly, people increasingly find meaning in the 
products and services they buy during the ZMOT. They want to 
know about the company and the people behind an offering. 
They want to know how it fits into their value system and how 
it will define them personally. 
You may rightfully point out that people have always engaged 
in conversations with brands. Markets are conversations 
indeed. What’s different now is a combination of the breadth 
of content available and the speed at which consumers can 
access it. Now, it’s expected that a customer researches various 
aspects of your business before even coming in direct contact 
with you or your offerings. 
In any event, the various parts of a product or service expe­
rience are now much more interrelated than they were just a 
decade ago. A holistic mindset is needed to connect moments 
of truth and design meaningful experiences for people.

•	 Epistemic value is generated by a sense of curiosity or a 
desire to learn. This type of value emphasizes personal 
growth and the acquisition of knowledge. The Khan 
Academy, for instance, provides online courses for people 
to learn at their own pace.  
•	 Conditional value is a benefit that depends on specific 
situations or contexts. For instance, the perceived value of 
pumpkins and monster costumes increases conditionally 
just before Halloween in the US each year. 
Beyond these types, design strategist and educator Nathan 
Shedroff points to meaning as forms of what he calls “premi­
um value.”† This exceeds mere novelty and delight, and looks 
at the purpose products and services have in our lives. Prod­
ucts and services that provide meaningful experiences help us 
make sense of the world and give us personal identity.
Together with coauthors Steve Diller and Darrel Rheas Shedroff 
identifies 15 types of premium value in the book Making 
Meaning:
1.	 Accomplishment. The sense of pride in achieving goals
2.	 Beauty. The appreciation of aesthetic qualities that give 
pleasure to the senses
3.	 Community. A sense of connectedness with others 
around us
†See Nathan Shedroff’s talk at Interaction South America on the topic of design 
and value creation: “Bridging Strategy with Design: How Designers Create Value 
for Businesses” (Nov 2014), http://bit.ly/1WM0410.
Focus on Creating Value
Business magnate Warren Buffet once said, “price is what you 
pay, value is what you get.” In other words, from the individu­
al’s perspective value is a much richer, more dynamic concept 
than cost, involving human behavior and emotions. Value is a 
perceived benefit.
Existing frameworks help us understand the subjective nature 
of the concept. Sheth, Newman and Gross* identify five types 
of customer value:
•	 Functional value relates to the ability to perform a utilitar­
ian purpose. Performance and reliability are key consider­
ations with this type of value. 
•	 Social value refers to the interaction among people, 
emphasizing lifestyle and social awareness. For instance, 
Skype in the Classroom is a program aimed at inspiring 
students with prominent speakers who lecture from 
remote locations.
•	 Emotional value emphasizes the feelings or affective 
responses a person has while interacting with an orga­
nization’s offerings. For example, personal data security 
services tap into the fear of identity theft or data loss.

Jobs to Be Done
The concept of jobs to be done provides a lens through which 
to understand value creation. The framework looks at custom­
er motivations in business settings. When we map experiences, 
we are effectively mapping jobs to be done.
The term was made popular by business leader Clayton Chris­
tensen in his book The Innovator’s Solution, the follow-up to his 
landmark work The Innovator’s Dilemma. It’s a straightforward 
principle: people “hire” products and services to get a job done. 
For instance, you might hire a new suit to make you look 
good at a job interview. Or, you hire Facebook to stay in touch 
with friends on a daily basis. You could also hire a chocolate 
bar to relieve stress. These are all jobs to be done. For each 
job, there are three dimensions to consider:
Functional job
The practical task at hand to meet a person’s requirements. 
Emotional job
The feelings a person desires while completing a job.
Social job
How a person believes he or she will be perceived socially 
while using the solution. 
Typically, a job to be done is expressed in terms of its func­
tional jobs. As a result, many people assume the technique is 
nothing more than task analysis or a list of use cases. This is 
a fallacy. Jobs to be done are ultimately about an underlying 
need and desired outcomes.

Diagrams illuminate the human dynamics of value creation 
at all levels. They embrace the subjective nature of value and 
provide organizations an outside-in view to the value they 
actually create. 
As a class of documents, alignment diagrams foster value-
centered design. They allow you to visualize and locate value 
within your offering ecosystem. From this you can ask, what is 
your value proposition at each point in the experience? Or, how 
is the organization meaningfully unique from the customer’s 
perspective? And, what meaning can you create for customers?

Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences

Summary
The concept of transitional volatility in web navigation serves 
as an analogy for the experiences people have when moving 
from touchpoint to touchpoint of a provider. If individuals 
have to constantly reorient themselves, the experience feels 
incoherent. Coherency in experience is a common goal for 
most organizations, and has been shown to increase profits. 
But experiences are frustratingly intangible and overwhelm­
ingly broad. As the mapmaker, it’s your job to frame the 
diagram and experiences you’ll be mapping. This includes de­
cisions about the perspective, scope, focus, structure, and use. 
Chapter 4 discusses the process of selection in more detail.  
Touchpoints are the means by which an interaction between 
individuals and an organization can take place. Typically, these 
are seen in terms of interaction with an advertisement, appli­
cations, websites, a service encounter, and a phone call. 
A broader definition of touchpoints, however, sees them as 
the context in which they occur. The interaction between an 
individual and an organization happens at a given time and 
within a given environment. Organizations that design for and 
manage coherency across touchpoints see enormous benefits: 
greater satisfaction, stronger loyalty, and larger returns.  
Moments of truth are critical, emotionally intense moments. 
They are those instances that make or break a relationship. 
Looking for the moments of truth gives points to potential 
opportunities for innovation. 
For instance, a homeowner may buy a digital keyless lock for 
their front door. The desired outcome is to reduce the chance 
that an intruder can enter their home. But there’s also an 
emotional job: to increase the homeowner’s sense of safety 
and security. Socially, the digital lock also fulfills the jobs of 
letting invited guests in and out as desired. 
Viewing value creation in this way shifts focus from the 
psycho-demographic aspects of individuals to their goals and 
motivations. It’s not about the user but about usage.  
Finally, the context of the job is critical to understand. Chris­
tensen writes: 
Companies that target their products at the circum­
stances in which customers find themselves, rather 
than at the customers themselves, are those that can 
launch predictably successful products. Put another 
way, the critical unit of analysis is the circumstance and 
not the customer.
Alignment diagrams describe those circumstances—the 
broader context of goals, desired outcomes, and emotions, 
as well as constraints and pain points. Mapping experiences 
illustrates conditions of jobs to be done in an holistic way for 
everyone in an organization to learn from. 
Value is a much richer, more 
dynamic concept than cost involving 
human behavior and emotions. 
Value is a perceived benefit.

From the individual’s perspective, value is subjective and 
complex. There are many types of value they may consider: 
functional, emotional, social, epistemic, and circumstantial. 
Premium value goes beyond these types to include meaning 
and identity. 
Jobs to be done is an existing framework that helps view 
value from an individual’s standpoint. Popularized by Clayton 
Christensen, the practice looks at why people “hire” products 
and services to reach a desired outcome.

CASE STUDY
Identifying Opportunities: Combining Mental Model Diagrams 
and Jobs to Be Done
by Jim Kalbach, with Jen Padilla, Elizabeth Thapliyal, and Ryan Kasper
A key challenge in product development is selecting areas of 
improvements and innovation to focus on. A solid theory is 
needed to connect user insights to development decisions. 
To that end, the GoToMeeting user experience design team at 
Citrix embarked on efforts to provide actionable needs-based 
insight for product development. The approach combined 
mapping out user behaviors and motivations through a mental 
model diagram and prioritizing the users’ needs using the 
“jobs to be done” theory. This provided a visual map of the 
landscape as well as directions on how to create value to their 
customers. 
The overall process had six steps:
1.	 Conduct primary research.
We started with contextual inquiry. Broadly looking at the domain 
of work collaboration and communication, we conducted over 40 
on-site interviews. Stakeholders and team members were included 
in the interviewing process. 
Data collection included field notes, photos, audio recordings, 
and video. A third-party vendor transcribed all of the over 68 
hours of audio recordings. This resulted in nearly 1,500 pages 
of text.
1.	 Create a mental model diagram.
Following Indi Young’s approach closely, we analyzed the tran­
scriptions for the jobs people were trying to get done.  Through 
an iterative process of grouping, we created the mental model 
diagram. This is a bottom-up approach that entails clustering 
individual findings into themes, which are in turn grouped into 
categories.  
Fundamental goals and needs began to emerge. The result 
was illustration of “work collaboration” based directly on field 
research. 
The process also included the mapping of current products and 
features that support customer goals and needs. This allowed 
the team to see how our current offerings fit into a customer’s 
mental model.
2.	 Hold a workshop.
In a workshop with approximately 12 stakeholders from various 
departments, we read through the diagram in breakout groups. 
Each group got about a third of the overall mental model to 
work with. The goal was to have stakeholders first empathize 
with the current user experience (Figure 2-9).
Focus on Creating Value    39

CASE STUDY
We then brainstormed concepts using scenarios around the 
“future of work.” To do this, we presented each group with key 
trends about the future of work taken from industry reports. 
At each section of the diagram, we posed the question to the 
group, “If each trend came true, what must we do to support 
customers and ultimately to evolve as a company?”
To help socialize the outcomes of the workshop, we created an 
infographic summarizing the main conclusions. We printed this 
graphic on a single sheet of paper, had it laminated, and sent it 
by regular mail to workshop participants. A year or more later, 
it was still possible to see this infographic on teammates’ desks.
2.	 Map concepts to diagram.
After the workshop, we updated the diagram with comments 
and input from stakeholders. We then mapped various concepts 
back to the diagram below the support towers. This resulted in 
an extended map and composite picture: the user’s experience 
on the top, the support we currently offer in the middle, and 
future enhancements and innovations at the bottom (Figure 
2-12). 
But which gaps in people’s ability to collaborate should we aim 
to solve first? Jobs to be done (described above) then helped us 
focus on the concepts with the most potential. 
3.	 Prioritize jobs to be done.
We prioritized the jobs represented in the diagram by two 
factors:
–– The level of importance associated with getting the 
job done 
–– The level of satisfaction associated with getting the 
job done
Graphed on a chart, the jobs that are highly important but least 
satisfied have the highest chance of customer adoption (Figure 
2-10). They fulfill an unmet need.
To find this sweet spot, we employed a specific technique 
developed by Tony Ulwick. For more on this method, see 
Ulwick’s writings, listed in the “Further Reading” section.

with stakeholders. (The author is pictured with expert UX 
researcher Amber Brown.)

Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Mapping Experiences

CASE STUDY
The technique starts with generating so-called desired outcome 
statements, or the success measures for completing a job success­
fully. These were based directly on the mental model diagram. 
Next, we launched a quantitative survey with the complete set 
of about 30 desired outcome statements. Respondents were 
asked to rate each desired outcome statement for both impor­
tance and satisfaction. 
We then calculated the opportunity score for each statement. 
We determined this by taking the score for importance and 
adding the satisfaction gap, which is importance minus satis­
faction. For instance, if for a given statement respondents rated 
importance 9 and satisfaction 3, the result is 15 for the oppor­
tunity score (15 = 9 + ( 9 – 3 )). See Figure 2-11. 
Note that this score intentionally focuses on customer oppor­
tunity, not financial opportunity or market size opportunity. In 
other words, we were looking to solve for customer needs that 
would bring the chance of adoption by customers.
3.	 Focus innovation efforts.
The tasks in the mental model diagram, the opportunity scores, 
and proposed concepts were visually aligned, providing a clear 
picture of the opportunity space (Figure 2-12).
Efforts were prioritized against this information. This gave the 
team confidence that we were moving in the right direction—
one that was firmly grounded in primary insights. 
Product managers, marketing managers, and engineers found 
the information useful to their work. The prioritized list of peo­
ple’s needs turned out to be a highly consumable format for 
teams to engage with the research. One product owner said: 
“It’s great to have this data to help make informed decisions. 
I’m looking forward to incorporating it more and more.”

CASE STUDY
Through these efforts multiple concepts have been prototyped 
and two innovations are being launched in the Apple Store, 
along with several patent submissions. Overall, the approach 
gave a rich, user-centered theory for service development. The 
combination of the mental model and jobs to be done methods 
has served as a centerpiece in the process, fostering many con­
versations and gathering consensus.

The Mechanics of Interface Design
The Push and Pull of Prototypes Versus 
Pixel Perfection
I keep a large number of details that will later go. I first do the 
animal with almost all its trappings. Then I gradually eliminate 
them…
—FRANÇOIS POMPON, FRENCH SCULPTOR AND ANIMALIER
Born in 1855, one of my favorite new artists, François Pompon, 
applied his coveted talents as a sculpting assistant for legendary artists 
Auguste Rodin and Camille Claudel in Paris. It wasn’t until 1922 at 
the age of 67, however, that Pompon became famous for his own work. 
Called L’ours Blanc, or The White Bear, Pompon’s huge sculpture of a 
polar bear is something truly unique (Figure 6-1). It lacks any orna­
mentation or flourish. It eliminates every unnecessary detail. And it 
makes no attempt to be realistic. Without these elements, the viewer is 
struck by the raw presence and personality of the bear. Pompon elimi­
nated the unnecessary details to help us focus on what makes the bear, 
well, a bear.
In this case, both the product and the process fascinate me. Pompon 
would actually sculpt his subjects (at this point in his life, they were 
mostly animals) with most of the details intact. Then, over time, he’d 
eliminate these details—the waviness of the fur, the texture of the 
[ 6 ]

feathers, the sharpness of the claw—to focus on only the necessary 
aspects of the subject’s form. Without these details, he let the viewer 
focus on the purest elements of the animal’s character.
As product designers, our job in this phase is similar, albeit less physi­
cal. We’re gathering all of the information we can, completely immers­
ing ourselves in the problems faced by our potential customers. We’re 
binging on current alternatives in the marketplace, sampling heav­
ily to get inspiration for our own yet-to-be-invented solutions. Then, 
we’re iterating rapidly through the most plausible solutions to see what 
works best.
At this stage, we’re already moving along the process of stripping away 
the unnecessary. Increasing fidelity. Moving toward something we can 
ship (Figure 6-2). In Chapter 4, we created the copy for our product’s 
interface and began turning that copy into user flows and screens. In 
Chapter 5, we began morphing those flows into something tangible, 
something we could use to test ideas and start feeling how the product 
might behave.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  123
Now, we’re finally going to refine these elements into the ingredients 
necessary for a badass user interface. 
I think a lot of product designers make the mistake of jumping directly 
into Photoshop or Sketch or Illustrator. They misinterpret what it 
means to be interface first, and get caught in a loop of trying to achieve 
pixel perfection before really knowing which direction they’re going.
Look, there’s a push and a pull between all these axes. If interface 
copywriting, pixel-perfect mocks, and functioning prototypes were on 
a spaceship together, they’d be the directional thrusters responsible for 
lining up the ship for a clean seal on the airlock. 
Like I said in Chapter 5, this push-and-pull depends on your time­
frame, your internal audience, the required fidelity at any given stage, 
and your comfort with the tools you’re using. 
But at some point after you’ve written out your interface and its flows, 
you’re going to have to deliver pixel-perfect mocks. 
Here’s why. See, regardless of the internal living document that is your 
product plan and milestones—call it a spec, call it a user story, call it 
whatever buzzword your people use—combined with the prototypes 
you create, you’re still going to need the “hero” version of your prod­
uct’s interface. 
Apple, unsurprisingly, takes this approach to the extreme. Called 10 to 
3 to 1, Apple product designers are expected to design 10 wholly differ­
ent, high-fidelity mocks for each feature to be built. The 10 ideas are 
narrowed down to the best three, and then the team combines the best 
ideas of the best three into the final product.*

While this approach might seem too systematic or wasteful to some, it 
balances the pressures of creativity with a production mentality. It cod­
ifies the fact that most ideas will be left on the cutting room floor, but 
also sets limits on creative exploration. The goal is to drive a designer’s 
imagination in the right direction.
Why? Because pixel-perfect mockups are the ultimate communicator, 
because they can be integrated into your prototypes and filled out with 
the real copy you’ve already created. Then, boom. Suddenly, you’re fool­
ing everybody that this is a real product. Disbelief is suspended, and 
true opinions flow out. On top of that, pixel perfection, combined with 
prototypes, are the ultimate guidebook for engineers. 
So when the final product launches, nobody’s going to be taken by 
surprise. 
I’ll take those benefits over a so-called functional spec any day.
But while pixel perfection is critical, it sure ain’t easy. It takes a crazy 
amount of time. There are multiple screen sizes. Different platforms. 
Landscape mode. Portrait mode. Ergonomics to keep in mind. And 
five states for every interface.
But if you plan for these contingencies, the process becomes less 
overwhelming. 
Let’s start with the UI stack. In the next section, you’ll learn how to 
avoid the pitfalls of what I call “awkward UI” by always remembering 
how the five states of an interface work together.
The UI Stack: Five States of Interface Design
Have you ever experienced a user interface that feels lifeless? Have you 
created a UI that just seems to be missing…something?
If that’s the case, you’ve probably experienced a case of awkward UI. 
Awkward UI is a missing loading indicator. It’s forgetting to tell your 
customer where something went wrong (bonus points for doing so 
with a scary error message). It’s a graph that looks weird with only a 
few data points. It’s a linear snap into place when a new piece of data 
is introduced.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  125
Still not clear about what awkward UI is? Here’s a simple real-world 
example: I use Apple TV. A lot. (In fact, I have the latest episode of 
Star Wars: Rebels playing in the background as I write this.) Whenever 
I pull up my Purchased movies, I see the screen shown in Figure 6-3.
For a second, I get scared. Every time. And I use this screen often. I 
know what to expect.
But why am I scared? What are the mechanics that cause my brain to 
think I’m seeing what the Apple TV intends for me to see? 
There’s no loading indicator. No sign of activity. So in the span of sec­
onds, scary questions race through my head. Where are my movies? 
Are they lost? Deleted? Hijacked? 
Then, after my heart stops racing, the movies I own suddenly and 
unceremoniously pop into place. 
Man, that’s jarring. 
Contrast this with playing a movie. After clicking “play” on the Apple 
remote, I see a nice indicator that Back to the Future is getting ready to 
play (Figure 6-4).
FIGURE 6-3
Apple TV’s loading 
indicator for calling 
up a list of purchases

scares me. Every time.

Notice the experiential difference? 
Creating interfaces that are easily understood by humans puts us 
product designers right up against the sad fact that computers are lazy. 
They don’t care about helping people understand what’s new, what to 
do next, or how to react when something goes wrong.
In a computer’s ideal world, all it would have to do is throw obscure 
error codes and scary-sounding alerts when something unexpected 
happens. Or, better yet, it would just talk with you in binary. 
But we don’t speak binary. We think in flows, and we’re used to the 
physical world. When a door opens, it swings on an arc. When some­
thing travels, you can see it move. When something falls, you can see 
it bounce. 
Awkward UI is when a product designer doesn’t take these things into 
account. That means that somewhere along the line, some rules have 
been broken. 
But which rules? 
The rules of the UI stack. Let’s talk about that now.
What’s the UI Stack?
Every screen you interact with in a digital product has multiple person­
alities. Five, to be exact (Figure 6-5).
FIGURE 6-4
The comforting signs of 
progress.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  127
FIGURE 6-5
The UI Stack consists of the five states of a single screen’s user interface, as 
well as how the user moves through those states.
Depending on the context, these personalities are revealed to your cus­
tomer. In designer-speak, we call these states. And you should consider 
these states for every screen you make. 
That’s because following the rules of the UI stack and the five states 
helps you create a cohesive interface that’s forgiving, helpful, and 
human. 
Be honest with yourself. When’s the last time you created a screen that 
had only one state? Even if you’re creating weather apps (cue Dribbble 
joke), one state won’t cut it.
The reality is that the world in which we live isn’t perfect, and things 
go wrong. Servers take time to respond. And your customers won’t 
always use your product the way in which you intended. 
So, as a product designer, you’ve got to take these realities into account. 
That’s why every screen you’ll design for your product can have up to 
five states:
•	 Ideal state
•	 Empty state, including first-time use

128  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
•	 Error state
•	 Partial state
•	 Loading state
As your customer moves through your product’s flows, they’re also 
going to move seamlessly between between each state within those 
flows. In other words, each state in the UI stack is built with the notion 
that UI states smoothly transition from one to another, and as many 
times as necessary. We’ll explore this notion together in the section “A 
Hypothetical Example” of this chapter on page 152.
But first, a brief interlude into Internet history. Back in 2004, Basecamp, 
the company formerly known as 37signals, wrote, in my humble opin­
ion, a groundbreaking piece entitled The Three State Solution.* (And 
no, this isn’t a plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.) They out­
lined that every screen should consider three possible states: “regular, 
blank, and error.” This blew my mind. And changed how I thought 
about design for the Web forever.
But things change on the Internet. First, there was the AJAX revolu­
tion (coinciding with the rise of Web 2.0, as it was then known). Then 
came mobile apps. Next came the mass consumerization of mobile 
and tablets and the Web in general.
Demands and expectations for UIs changed. And so the UI stack is my 
adaptation of the decade-plus idea from Basecamp.
With that noted, let’s talk about the ideal state.
IDEAL STATE
This is the first state to create, since it’s what you want people to see 
most often. Aptly named, it embodies the zenith of your product’s 
potential—when your product is providing maximum value and is 
full of useful, actionable content. It’ll serve as the foundation for every 
other state you’ll create for this screen. Think of this as the quintessen­
tial marketing page or mobile app store screenshot.
Let this state set the tone of each of the other states. Because as you 
iterate on your core interface, this UI could change completely over 
time. That’s both the beauty and the risk of iteration. 
And this has vast consequences for all of the other states.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  129
All UI states lead to the ideal state. So start with this first, and let all of 
the other states fall into place as your designs get closer to solving your 
customer’s problem. 
Still not sure what I mean by the ideal state? Let’s take a look at some 
examples to clarify (see Figures 6-6 through 6-8).

EMPTY STATE
An empty state really is bigger than just one screen. It’s about pro­
viding your customer an incredible first impression as you introduce 
them to your product—to spur them to action, keep them interested, 
and remind them of the value your product’s going to provide.
There are three broad versions of the empty state. The first is what’s 
seen by your customer the first time they use your product. The sec­
ond is what’s seen when your customer voluntarily clears existing data 
from the screen, like when you attain the exalted “Inbox Zero,” for 
example. And the third is what happens when there isn’t anything to 
show, say, for a search result.
Broadly speaking, the risk with empty states is that it’s easy to tack 
them on as an afterthought. Most of the time, doing this either creates 
an overwhelming experience (see Figure 6-9) or a cold, impersonal 
one.
FIGURE 6-8

Starbucks’s app, which 
shows one’s various

part is that keeping my 
balances this high on a

At least it’s a relatively 
cheap addiction.

Coach marks—or instructional overlays—are, in my opinion, the 
best examples of an underthought first-time experience. They place a 
burden of learning on the customer that includes more interface and 
more memorization, all done with a pretty big mental interruption. 
What a buzzkill.
Let’s explore the first-time use state more in depth.
First-time use/onboarding
If a customer is using your product for the first time, this state is your 
one shot to describe what your customer will see when data exists. It’s 
your opportunity to encourage action, to help them understand the 
value they’re going to get out of this screen. First impressions happen 
only once, and this is your chance to make a great one.
FIGURE 6-9
 As George Takei would 
say: “Oh, my…” While 
I love Propellerhead’s

to remember all of this?

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  133
I liken this state partially to what’s known in the literary and screen­
writing world as the “hero’s journey” (Figure 6-10). Introduced by 
Joseph Campbell in his amazing work The Hero with a Thousand 
Faces,* it’s the foundation of mythological stories found throughout 
the world, from The Odyssey to Star Wars. Here’s the basic premise:
A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region 
of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and 
a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysteri­
ous adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.
Propel your customers down the hero’s journey with the empty state. 
Call them to adventure, take them through known challenges and 
the temptations of the abyss, and transform them into more powerful 
individuals.

But how? Some ideas:
•	 Lead a horse to water. Be encouraging and uplifting in your copy­
writing, and speak plainly about what to do. For example, saying 
things like “Nothing to see here” really says nothing about what 
your customer should expect, and it’s a bit depressing that this 
would be the first thing they’d see. Instead, telling your customer 
the exact button to press and why they should press it is a much 
more helpful prospect.
•	 Use your product’s content to instruct your customer about what 
to do. For example, if you’re building a messaging product, your 
first-time experience might automatically include a message in 
the customer’s inbox. The subject line could say “tap to open me,” 
while the text within the message discusses more about how to 
manipulate and reply to a message.
•	 Offer an example screenshot of what the screen will look like in 
the ideal state. It brings a bit of hope to your customer that they’ll 
achieve something similar while showing off how potentially use­
ful your product can be.
•	 Monitor your customer’s progress and respond accordingly. If they 
pause too long on a certain screen, for example, you could mes­
sage them with a live chat asking if they need help.
Figures 6-11 through 6-14 show a few first-time-use empty states that 
I love.

Hipchat comes right out

hopefully, demonstrates 
its value by getting 
you a response back in 
real time. One critique 
is that the copy isn’t 
aware of the fact 
that Kyle is currently 
idle, what this means, 
and that he may not 
respond immediately.

The subject of onboarding and first-time states is a topic big enough 
for another book. And it just so happens that one exists. If you want 
to jump into the user onboarding pool, I highly recommend Samuel 
Hulick’s excellent The Elements of User Onboarding.*
User-cleared data
The second type of empty state is the case where your customer has 
voluntarily removed data from the screen. An example of this would 
be if your customer completed all of the items on their to-do list, read 
all of their notifications, archived all of their emails, or finished down­
loading all of their music.

These types of empty states are great opportunities to reward your cus­
tomers or to spur further action (Figure 6-15). Achieved “Inbox Zero”? 
Great! View this amazing photo. Downloaded all of your music? 
Good—now go listen to it. Sifted through all of your notifications? 
Here’s something else you might want to read. 
A customer clearing data is a customer who’s engaged with your prod­
uct. Keep them in the flows your product has in place by doing the 
work for them. Don’t put the onus on your customer to make the next 
leap.
No results
In cases where your customers are browsing or searching for a piece of 
data in your product, there’s a chance that they won’t find what they’re 
looking for. These scenarios are amazing opportunities to infer what 
your customer intended to find and to make intelligent suggestions.

Amazon employs one of the best examples I’ve seen of this technique. 
Accounting for misspellings and similar searches, Amazon’s search 
rarely gives you an empty result (Figure 6-16). Instead, it’ll give you the 
closest matching result while showing which terms it didn’t match. 
As for Pinterest (Figure 6-17), well, not quite the same results as 
Amazon, but this is Pinterest, after all. Based upon how their search 
parsed my query, it should be relatively easy for a customer to adjust 
their search terms to get what they want.

The lesson: don’t just drive your customer off a wall in this state. Give 
them something they might be able to work with, or suggest an alter­
nate path.
ERROR STATE
This is the screen when things go wrong. Typically, this is more com­
plex than just one screen, since errors can occur in surprising com­
binations. Error states can include anything from missing or invalid 
form data; an inability for your app to connect to the server; the app 
trying to move forward to the next step without finishing an upload, 
leaving a page without text submitted; and more. 
FIGURE 6-17
Notice the search 
results are categorized 
(“Handmade”), and the 
search term is turned

140  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Error states should also be comforting in the sense that your prod­
uct keeps all user input safe. Your product shouldn’t undo, destroy, or 
delete anything entered or uploaded by your customer in the event of 
an error. 
It’s apt to paraphrase Jef Raskin, creator of the original Macintosh and 
author of The Humane Interface. He writes: 
The system should treat all user input as sacred and—to para­
phrase Asimov’s first law of robotics, ‘A robot shall not harm a 
human, or, through inaction, allow a human to come to harm.’ 
The first law of interface design should be: A computer shall not 
harm your work or, through inaction, allow your work to come to 
harm.*
This advice could be well heeded by some particularly vile offenders 
of this rule: airline websites. Missing a tiny form field for a credit card 
security code, for example, frequently results in a page reload that 
blows away all of your meticulously entered details while highlighting 
the missed field with an offensive red hue (Figure 6-18).

FIGURE 6-19
Basecamp’s delightful, human, and highly specific error message upon signup 
for a new account.
Ideal error states, like Basecamp’s, occur dynamically without destroy­
ing any data input by the user. If a page or screen reload must occur 
to detect an error, please do everyone a favor and save whatever data—
however flawed—was input into your product. Typically, though, 
reloading a page to detect an error is a sign of laziness. For the sake of 
your customers, ensure you and your developers go the extra mile to 
handle errors in graceful and accommodating ways.
Additionally, error states shouldn’t be dramatic, nor should they be 
vague. Remember the “Blue Screen of Death”? The Mac’s “Kernel 
Panic”? Or—for those computing veterans—”Abort, Retry, Fail”? 
Each of these error states, by necessity, marked a significant system 
error requiring a computer reboot or retry. But to this day, each is well 
remembered because of the shock, fear, and confusion it conveyed to 
the end user.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  143
Microsoft’s Blue Screen of Death (Figure 6-20) became so infa­
mous because it simply freaked people out. The blue screen—while 
better than a red one—was out of context, abrupt, and filled with 
scary-sounding jargon, even if it was useful in debugging the problem. 
That’s because error states must incorporate concise, friendly, and 
instructive copy as to what to do next. Vague error codes, hexadecimal 
numbers, and confusing advancement options are only going to scare 
and frustrate the people who experience these errors. 
Of course, your product’s audience might consist of rocket scientists 
or computer engineers. That’s a case when these highly technical error 
messages may be well suited to your customer. But as most of the 
world adopts software in their everyday lives, these types of error mes­
sages become less and less appropriate. 
Generally speaking, great error messages are:
•	 Written with your specific customer in mind.
•	 Constructive, clear, and helpfully specific.
•	 Positive—not intimidating or overly dramatic.
•	 Presented with the core of the error first, and, if possible, an 
inferred solution.
•	 Specific about exactly what is in error.

•	 As timely as possible.
•	 Written in grammatically and thematically correct language, 
without jargon and excessive abbreviation.
•	 Offered with clear paths or options to resolution, and with­
out excessive requirements (especially in the event of password 
security).
The error state is such a widespread occurrence, and one of the least 
desirable states for which to design. But I promise that if you put as 
much care into this state as you do into the previous two states, your 
product will be infinitely more joyful to use—and, more helpful, as 
you’ll have thought through common customer pitfalls and solved 
them in advance.
PARTIAL STATE
The difference between an error state and an ideal state is like night 
and day. But how does the screen look when there’s only one row of 
data? A few photos? A half-completed profile? 
The partial state is the screen someone will see when the page is no 
longer empty and sparsely populated. Your job here is to prevent peo­
ple from getting discouraged and giving up on your product. 
This is a great opportunity to design micro-interactions to guide peo­
ple toward the full glory of the ideal state. It’s a journey on which you 
take your customers to help them realize the true value of your prod­
uct. This implies an accomplishment—that your customer has spent 
some time in your product to see a glimpse of its potential. Keep them 
hooked. 
Some game design principles can be useful here. I’m not referring 
to the scourge-like yet addictive practice of making your customers 
gather crystals to advance à la Clash of Clans (Figure 6-21), but instead 
building what is called acceleration into this state of your product.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  145
FIGURE 6-21
Big, huge arrows in Clash of Clans lead me to build a cannon so I can expend

Acceleration helps a player visualize how they’ll be more powerful in 
the future, guiding them along a predefined series of tasks to complete 
to achieve this vision. The trick is to make the player not realize they’re 
performing what could be perceived as tedium in order to extract the 
maximum value from your product. 
Players entering [an acceleration phase] aren’t thinking about the 
tedious repetitions they have to perform in order to level up, they’re 
just doing them, and enjoying the accelerating rate of the results…
Rather, those players are caught up in a future in which their 
character(s) will be powerful in a way they can’t even understand 
yet. To put it more technically, they’re inferring an exponentially 
increasing power structure that vanishes beyond their player pre­
diction horizon. It’s not exactly the same as traditional flow, but 
the exhilaration of the players is subjectively very similar.†

LOADING STATE
It’s easy to overlook this state, and many product designers insert it as 
an afterthought. But there’s a very real burden that comes with setting 
expectations. When your app is loading data, waiting for an Internet 
connection, or transitioning to another screen, you must take great 
care to be mindful of how you represent situations where you’re fetch­
ing data. This can consist of an entire page takeover, lazy loading of 
content panes, or inline loading, potentially used when one might look 
up username availability from a form field. 
And the perception of loading is equally important. Too often design­
ers simply fill their screens with whitespace and spinners, placing a 
massive burden of responsibility on the content that isn’t there. This, 
FIGURE 6-24

fitness app. Its entire 
goal is to get you to “fill

in turn, encourages your customers to figuratively watch the clock—
putting the focus on the indication of progress versus actual loading 
progress being made.
Such is the belief of Luke Wroblewski, a product design expert that’s 
led design teams from eBay to Yahoo! to Google, where he now resides 
after selling his mobile polling startup Polar.
Wroblewski and his team discovered that after they implemented a 
series of loading spinners for each poll, Polar customers began com­
plaining that the app seemed slower, saying things like “There seems 
to be an excessive amount of waiting around for pages to refresh and 
load—it doesn’t seem as quick as the previous version.”
Wroblewski realized that:
With the introduction of these progress indicators, we had made 
people watch the clock. As a result, time went slower and so did 
our app. We focused on the indicator and not the progress, that is 
making it clear you are advancing toward your goal not just wait­
ing around.*
Skeleton screens
This realization directly resulted in the creation of what Wroblewski 
calls “skeleton screens” (Figure 6-25). They’re a technique that’s been 
co-opted by at least Pinterest and Facebook in both their web and 
mobile versions.
Skeleton screens are an innovative take on the loading state—they 
place the focus on the content as it loads versus the fact that the con­
tent is loading. They accomplish this by displaying the basic structure 
of the page and gradually filling in the missing pieces as they down­
load. The beautiful thing about this technique is that it can eliminate 
spinners completely. And it can increase the perceived performance of 
your product.

Pinterest, while employing the use of the skeleton screen loading state 
concept, put a unique twist on its implementation: deriving the “aver­
age color” of the pin’s image and using that color to fill in the pin’s 
background. So before the pin’s image loads, you feel like you get a 
preview of what the pin will be. This technique is now used in Google 
Image search results, too.
Facebook invented a similar technique, used in their mobile app 
Paper and later implemented in their web version (Figure 6-26). The 
Facebook experience displays a stylized skeleton screen with shapes 
resembling content. And to communicate that the content is loading, 
the shapes will pulse with what Facebook calls a “shimmer effect.”

“Nobody wants to wait while they wait,” said Instagram cofounder 
Mike Krieger in 2011 as he described how his engineering efforts

Take the case of “liking” a photo or leaving a comment. In both cases, 
the action is registered as completed instantly from the perspective of 
the customer. And in the background, the product is making server 
requests to actually complete the action. 
Optimistic actions can also greatly help to reduce the perceived speed 
of uploading media. Instead of uploading when a user taps “Done” 
at the end of the photo upload flow, Instagram starts uploading the 
photo immediately after a filter is selected. While it’s not an optimal

Following the “move bits when no one’s watching” mantra can help 
make your product’s speed one of your assets.
A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE
You’ve seen a number of examples of the UI stack and its five states in 
isolation (Figure 6-28). But how would they work together? How does 
the UI account for the transitions between each state? 
FIGURE 6-28
A reminder of the UI stack and its elements.
That’s the power of the UI stack. These states don’t exist in vacuums. 
They exist on a vertical axis that can be called at any time by the prod­
uct. It’s your job not only to account for each of these states, but to dic­
tate how the screen moves between each state. 
I’ve created a hypothetical messaging app to illustrate these ideas.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  153
Why a messaging app? Because it’s not an immediately obvious 
example of these states at play. But I think it’s a great example of how 
even temporal UIs like messaging interfaces follow the rules of the 
UI stack. And, even further, it’s an illustration of how immense our 
responsibility is to ensure that each screen’s states flow smoothly from 
one to another. 
So what do we have to deal with in a messaging app? 
We have to account for when there’s no messages. This is our blank 
state.
Our partial state is when only one party has sent a message.
Then, there’s receiving a message—the typing indicator. This, in other 
words, is our loading state. 
But wait. There’s another series of loading states—when we send a 
message out. And then there’s the delivery confirmation. 
An error can happen along the line, too. That’s when our message fails 
to send. 
And you can’t forget the mechanism by which we recover from an 
error, and attempt to send again. There’s another version of the load­
ing state.
Finally, we reach our ideal state: when messages turn into a 
conversation. 
Our hypothetical messaging app
Let’s say Marty and Doc just exchange numbers and Marty wants to 
message Doc about what he’s just seen at Twin Pines Mall. 
Since there are no messages, we have an opportunity to exploit the 
empty state and encourage the customer into acting how we want 
them to act—in this case, that’s sending a message (Figure 6-29). 

154  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
FIGURE 6-29
The blank state transitions into the partial state.
But what happens to this state when a message is sent? We need to 
gracefully wash away the empty state and shift it into a partial state: in 
this case, that’s when Marty sends only one message. 
Let’s fast forward to when Doc has responded (Figure 6-30). He’s 
sent one message—but he’s not done yet! Hence the typing indicator, 
another form of a loading state. 

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  155
FIGURE 6-30
The loading state—in this case, the typing indicator—transitions into a new 
incoming message.
Once the typing is done and the message is sent, we transition out of 
the typing indicator and bring in the new message, pushing the others 
out of the way. 
But what about when Marty wants to reply back (Figure 6-31)? First, 
we have to show some state awareness when there is text in the field—
notice how the “Send” button turns from grey (a disabled state) to blue 
(an enabled state). Then, once we send the message, another loading 

156  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
state occurs for our send process. We keep the message dimmed 
during this time because there’s not a successful delivery yet—until 
the “delivered” stamp tells the customer that all is well. 
FIGURE 6-31
Sending a message requires state awareness changes on the “Send” button, 
as well as a series of loading states and a delivery confirmation.
But what happens if the message isn’t successfully delivered (Figure 
6-32)? Here comes our error state. The red marker replaces the loading 
spinner, and we’re left with a message in the “undelivered” dimmed 
state. Tapping (or, in this case, clicking into the Quartz Composer pro­
totype) on the undelivered message retries the send. We’re in luck this 
time, and the message fills in after the angry red “!” disappears and we 
can register a delivered indicator.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  157
FIGURE 6-32
Retrying a message delivery after a failed attempt. Getting out of the error 
state requires some careful considerations.
And that, my friends, is the UI stack in action. 
It’s the five screen states and the seamless transitions between them. 
Without these transitional elements, we risk confusing or surprising 
our customers as new states appear and disappear. Making people 
uncomfortable and confused isn’t exactly in our job description, now, 
is it?
Speaking of comfort, let’s shift over to the ergonomic considerations 
UIs need to consider in this world of touch screens and wearables.
Ergonomics: Thumb Zones and Tap Targets
In the last section, we dove into the five states of a user interface: ideal, 
partial, empty, error, and loading. These constitute the UI stack. And 
they exist on every screen you design—these user interface states are 
universal, no matter the context. Desktop. Mobile. Tablet. Wearables. 
TVs. Cars. 
Now, we’re going to talk about how your interface should take into 
account the physical world.

No, we haven’t suddenly jumped into the world of Minority Report, 
Back to the Future 2015 style, or gotten to play with those awesome 
holograms Tony Stark made with his friend JARVIS (or is he his 
friend? Hmmm…)
We’re actually going to be talking about natural thumb arcs and why 
they’re important for touch screen design. 
See, if you aren’t designing yet for touch screens, you soon will be. 
Don’t believe me? Look at Figure 6-33. IT’S A BABY USING AN iPAD. 
For the first time ever, a generation is growing up touch-screen-first. 
Let’s just say touch-based interactions aren’t going anywhere anytime 
soon. The mouse is becoming a relic of the past. We now must design 
for screens that can be tapped, pinched, swiped, zoomed, and more. 
So how do we handle this? 
Well, remember when we explored the history of product design in 
Chapter 1 together? We looked at the work of Lillian Gilbreth, Henry 
Dreyfuss, and Scott Cook. What was the big theme? 
Research. Namely, we need to understand how people hold their 
phones, tablets, and wearables, and how they use touch-enabled 
desktops. 
And we’re in luck.
Mobile expert Steve Hoober conducted a study with 1,333 people in 
early 2013.* He discovered that people held their phones in the follow­
ing ways (Figure 6-34):

•	 One-handed: 49%
•	 Cradled: 36%
•	 Two-handed: 15%
Handedness figures were also instructive:
•	 Right thumb on the screen: 67%
•	 Left thumb on the screen: 33%
Hoober notes that left-handedness figures in the population are around 
10 percent. So the observed higher rate of left-handed use could be cor­
related with people doing other things at the same time—smoking, 
riding a bike, drinking coffee, eating currywurst, and so on.
FIGURE 6-34
Steve Hoober’s 2013 study found that 49% of those observed used their 
phone with one thumb.†
So it’s looking like the 3.5- and 4-inch screens of yore will start their 
inevitable decline very quickly. That means that those of us who’ve got­
ten comfortable building apps, responsive sites, and mobile-optimized 
web views with the old ways in mind have to learn new tricks.
†	  https://twitter.com/lukew/status/510442401736187904

That decline is already in motion. Adobe’s 2014 Mobile Benchmark 
Report claims that mobile browsing among phones with 4-inch 
screens or smaller was down by 11 percent in May 2014 versus a year 
earlier (Figure 6-35).* 
FIGURE 6-35
Adobe reported in May 2014 that phones with “large” screens (defined as 
being above 4 inches) are driving more Internet traffic than ever.
But this only accounts for phones sold up to May 2014. If you remem­
ber, Apple reported the most successful quarter ever of any company 
well…ever, in January 2015. Almost 75 million iPhones were sold, with 
the iPhone 6 being its most popular device.†
That means that learning how to design for thumbs is now more 
important than ever. Luckily, it helps that these phone display sizes are 
going to be practically universal. A cursory examination‡ of the most 
popular Android screen sizes points to a range of 5.1 to 5.7 inches.§

Apple’s changes will make our lives easier as smaller screen sizes die 
off, since the iPhone 6 and 6+ clock in at 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. 
But why do we need to adapt our designs? As Hoober’s research 
showed, people using their phones tend to switch their grip depend­
ing on the interface’s demands. They seem to do this subconsciously, 
too, repositioning their hands or setting things down to take an action. 
That sends up a red flag for me, though. Why should people adapt to 
your app? Why is your app special? Why not create app controls that 
are the most comfortable for most people’s grips and thumb arcs? 
Designing for Thumbs?
What does it mean to design for thumbs? It means building inter­
faces that are the most comfortable to use within our thumb’s natural, 
sweeping arc.
But this gets complicated. Take touch screen mobile phones, for exam­
ple. We unconsciously adjust the way we hold our phones to reach cer­
tain controls in various areas of the screen. During any given day, I’ll 
wager that you stretch your grip, choke up on the phone, or angle it in 
ways that make reaching difficult areas easier.
But we have to start somewhere. Hoober’s research suggests that most 
of us hold our phones in the following way—with the bottom of the 
thumb anchored on the lower-righthand corner (Figure 6-36).

Right-handed phone 
use means the natural

ENTER THE THUMB ZONE
This leads us to the idea of the Thumb Zone. It’s a heat map of sorts—a 
best guess for how easy it is for our thumbs to tap areas on a touch 
screen.
Let’s use Hoober’s research to create a Thumb Zone map represent­
ing what seems to be the most common use case for touch screen use:
•	 One-handed use
•	 Right thumb on the screen
•	 Thumb anchored in the lower-righthand corner
Here’s the Thumb Zone heat map applied to mobile phone sizes from 
4 inches to almost 6 inches, measured diagonally (Figure 6-37).
FIGURE 6-37
The Thumb Zone applied to screen sizes from 4 inches up to approximately 6 
inches diagonally.
Here’s a more direct comparison of large screens next to each other—
4.7 inches and 5.5 inches (Figure 6-38).

164  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
You’ll notice that the “safe” green zone stays roughly the same (more 
on why the largest screen is different in a second). That’s because our 
thumbs don’t magically scale with the screen size. And that’s also 
unfortunate, because I loved Dhalsim in Street Fighter as a kid (Figure 
6-39).
FIGURE 6-38
4.7- and 5.5-inch 
screens with the Thumb 
Zone overlaid.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  165
But what changes is the sheer amount of “Ow” space, which becomes 
startlingly apparent with the 5.5-inch screen.
Furthermore, you’ll notice how the shape of the “Natural” zone 
changes for the largest screen. That’s because it requires a different 
type of grip due to its size, using your pinkie finger as a stabilizer. It 
surprises me how different the experience can be with less than an 
inch of added real estate.
Choking up
Let’s analyze how the Thumb Zones change when you shift your 
grip. Sometimes you might be in a situation where it’s easier to tap 
the phone with your thumb’s anchor at the vertical midpoint. This 
is demarcated by the white dot on the right side of the Thumb Zone 
mockups. 
Here’s an illustration of this in action for 4.7- and 5.5-inch screens 
(Figure 6-40).
FIGURE 6-39
Our fingers don’t 
magically stretch the 
way Dhalsim’s limbs did 
in Street Fighter.

166  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Notice how the larger screen actually gains natural thumb space 
because of its size. By comparison, the 4.7-inch screen just runs out 
of real estate.
Thumb-Friendly Interfaces in the Wild
Mobile screen sizes on the whole are becoming more similar, and 
that’s a good thing. But it also means that we can’t just treat screens 
above the 4.7-inch range simply as a scaled-up version of a smaller 
phone. Grips completely change, and with that, your interface might 
need to do so as well.
But how would that look? Let’s explore a few thumb-friendly interface 
ideas. 
AIRBNB
After Airbnb’s rebranding, the home rentals app went through a rede­
sign to place some primary actions near the bottom of the screen. Take 
a look at the two examples in Figure 6-41.
FIGURE 6-40
“Choking up” moves 
the midpoint of your 
hand and significantly 
affects your thumb arc.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  167
FIGURE 6-41
Airbnb’s ergonomic design.
Both screens have obvious primary actions, and they don’t depend on 
obscure gestures or OS-level controls— like Apple’s “reachability” fea­
ture, which brings the top of the screen down into Thumb Zone green 
territory with the double tap of the home button. 
Airbnb, however, does incorporate Apple’s “edge swipe” to prevent 
needless hand stretching to reach the top back arrow.

TINDER
Tinder’s primary controls are nice and obvious at the bottom of the 
screen, and well in the comfortable realm of the Thumb Zone. But 
what’s even more fantastic is that swiping each card away (both “Like” 
and “Nope”) lives in the green zone as well (Figure 6-42). 
Finally, the app’s been geared to respond to broader swipes for naviga­
tion—so swiping between Settings, Discovery, and your matches can 
be done with one hand. Beautiful. 
FIGURE 6-42
 Tinder’s a thumb 
heaven.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  169
In the end, placing controls closer to the bottom of the screen when 
designing for touch is a wise choice. This way, your controls are in 
reach of natural thumb arcs. And even if your customer cradles the 
phone with one hand and uses the other as their primary hand, your 
product will still be optimized for one-handed use. Don’t forget, too, 
where device manufacturers place their primary controls: Apple’s 
home button, Android’s navigation controls, and Windows Phone’s 
back, start, and search all rest at the bottom of the device.
Next up: how to design for an unlimited number of devices and their 
unique screen sizes, capabilities, and contexts.
Cross-Platform Design
There are now more mobile-connected devices than people on our 
planet.* And each device brings with it a series of constraints: screen 
sizes, input methods, hardware limitations, and more. 
But it gets even more nuanced. We’re using a more diverse set of 
devices on an individual level (Figure 6-43). In the morning, we might 
use a tablet, a mobile phone, and a TV. During the day, we might use 
a laptop, our smartwatch, and the onboard computers in our cars. 
And at night, we might be back to the mobile phone, tablet, and TV 
combination.

FIGURE 6-43
Charbeat’s study of how device usage varies by time of day. Each type of 
device has a very specific usage pattern.*
With the onset of cheap, networked, and largely touch-driven devices, 
there’s no way that we, as product designers, can predict the future. 
We live in a world now that already sees networked light bulbs, refrig­
erators, and toasters. Heck, my electric toothbrush even has a compan­
ion app. It tells me when to replace my brush head. Speaking of, I just 
got a push notification that I’m overdue for a replacement.
So when there’s an endless constellation of devices for which we might 
need to design consistent experiences, how do we cope? How do we 
create products that are not only future-proof, but can still destroy our 
customers’ pain on any device they decide to use? 
This was a big question. And so I turned to Benedikt Lehnert, the chief 
design officer of successful cross-platform to-do company Wunderlist. 
Wunderlist spans a slew of platforms from desktop to iOS to Kindle 
Fire, including iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, Android, Windows 
Phone, Windows, and the Web. Wunderlist was acquired by Microsoft 
in June 2015.
Lehnert had a few messages for us on this topic.

What Do Your Customers Need and Expect?
“We want people to feel that Wunderlist helps them get stuff done 
and keeps their life in sync,” Lehnert said in our interview. That’s the 
core task that Lehnert instilled in his product team when setting out 
to build a cross-platform experience. It’s “the most important thing to 
formulate, communicate, and instill in your team…how it feels for peo­
ple to interact with your product.” 
Lehnert’s statement reflects the spirit of what we’ve been talking about 
from the start in Chapter 1: your product exists to find a customer, and 
it stays alive by solving their pains. Living on a new platform doesn’t 
change this unbreakable rule. 
At Wunderlist, everything flows from here. “From there, you start and 
go into specific UX definitions and spec for each of the functional­
ities…we want every interaction to be as lightweight (fast and simple), 
easy (obvious and clear), and fun (delightful and human) as possible. 
The values that are formulated in our UX vision for Wunderlist shape 
every decision we make on flows, colors, language, iconography, etc.”
The Berlin-based company—consciously or unconsciously—infuses 
their product’s behavior on every platform with the things that their 
customers care about. Speed. Clarity. Simplicity. A little humanity. 
These are the commonalities a customer can expect to encounter 
when using Wunderlist, from iOS to Kindle Fire. 
What’s Specific to the Platform? 
Just because a customer might expect to have a consistent experience 
with your product across multiple platforms doesn’t mean that you can 
ignore the specifics of each operating system. 
“A cross-platform product experience has to be both consistent with 
the core product experience as well as the platform paradigms of each 
operating system,” Lehnert said. “So, as a designer your job is to know 
and understanding those paradigms in order to navigate your way 
through them.” Building a product for multiple platforms means that 
you have to respect the norms. On Android, for example, system con­
trols are at the bottom of the device, versus a single home button on 
iOS devices. This significantly affects how you approach a product on 
mobile phones and tablets. 

172  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
It’s the same with every platform. Designing for set-top boxes? You’ll 
need to know the capabilities of each remote control or controller—
Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Xbox, PS4, and so on—they 
each have their nuances. Being intimately aware of these nuances and 
incorporating them into your product is an essential responsibility of 
a product designer.
But there’s a limit. “Knowing when to follow the guidelines of the OS 
and when to break those guidelines in order to ensure consistency 
across platforms needs a certain level of experience and design mas­
tery,” said Lehnert. Ultimately, we’re building a product for our cus­
tomers. What are their needs? If the guidelines of the platform for 
which you’re building come into conflict with those responsibilities, 
what should you do?
“Whenever we find conflicting interactions across platforms, we try to 
come up with a better solution,” said Lehnert. “It’s easy to follow guide­
lines. It’s harder to know when to break them. We want to encourage 
all developers and designers to question existing paradigms and push 
boundaries with the end goal of making products easier and more 
enjoyable to use.”*
One example of this is the pull-to-refresh gesture versus the refresh 
button introduced by Loren Brichter in Tweetie, and since incorpo­
rated into Twitter’s app after Tweetie’s acquisition (Figure 6-44).

FIGURE 6-44
Lehnert compares the elegance of the pull-to-refresh gesture introduced 
in Twitter versus the refresh button, seen here in a previous version of 
Instagram.†
This is the perfect example of a UI evolution driven by platform con­
straints: in Tweetie 1.0, a refresh button would sit at the top of a user’s 
timeline. This was borne of necessity at the time—Brichter couldn’t 
fit a refresh button into the navigation bar. For the next version, he 
sought to correct this. “Why not just make refreshing part of the scroll 
gesture itself?” he asked himself. And so pull-to-refresh was born 
(Figure 6-45).‡

What Are the Use Cases for Each Device?
The same version of your product isn’t going to exist on every plat­
form. What are people trying to accomplish on their devices? When 
are they using them? A product that’s tone deaf to these considerations 
can easily blow it. 
I love how Lehnert characterizes this notion. “Wunderlist is a part of 
our user’s life on multiple devices and platforms every day,” he said. 
“Our goal is to escalate Wunderlist from mere software to a charac­
ter, a helpful friend, that is there when our users need or want it. An 
authentic character that is opinionated and infused with our values 
and which evolves over time in the way it looks, works, and speaks. 
That’s what inspires people and makes them fall in love with our 
Wunderlist.”
FIGURE 6-45
The pull-to-refresh in 
action in Tweetie.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  175
He knows the expectations that his customers have for Wunderlist in 
each unique situation, and they build the product on each platform 
to meet those expectations. “We want to get a deep understanding of 
what needs and demands people have in certain situations, and how 
we can cater the product best to their needs.”
So that’s why, for example, there’s not a full-fledged, bloated version of 
Wunderlist running on the Apple Watch. Instead, it’s a stripped-down, 
lean piece of software that tells someone only what they need to know, 
when they need to know it (Figure 6-46). 
FIGURE 6-46
Wunderlist’s contextual Apple Watch app in action.
“One of the most exciting things about Wunderlist for Apple Watch is 
the hands-free experience in situations where you would have had to 
juggle your phone,” Lehnert wrote. “Whether that’s going through the 
supermarket and checking items off your grocery list or, soon, using 
smart voice input to add to-dos for tomorrow’s meeting.”*

Remembering what your customer expects, respecting—and break­
ing, when it matters—a platform’s paradigms, and understanding the 
specific use cases of each platform are principles that are going to ben­
efit any product in the coming years. The number of screens, devices, 
and contexts is only going to increase. 
That concludes our exploration of the mechanics of interface design. 
Let’s review what we’ve discussed and move onto what goes into the 
psychology of an experience.
Shareable Notes
•	 There’s a push and a pull between interface copywriting, pixel-perfect 
mocks, and functioning prototypes. If they were all on a spaceship 
together, they’d be the directional thrusters responsible for lining 
up the ship for a clean seal on the airlock. 
•	 Eventually achieving pixel perfection in your mocks—or whatever 
you call them—is still a requirement. You’re still going to need the 
“hero” version of your product’s interface, regardless of the inter­
nal living document that is your product plan and milestones—
call it a spec, a user story, or whatever buzzword your people use.
•	 Pixel-perfect mockups are the ultimate communicator, because 
they can be integrated into your prototypes and filled out with the 
real copy you’ve already created. Suddenly, you’re fooling every­
body that this is a real product. Disbelief is suspended, and true 
opinions flow out. On top of that, pixel perfection, combined with 
prototypes, is the ultimate guidebook for engineers. But don’t 
forget: these are most effective after you’ve written out the user 
flows and created working prototypes. Otherwise, you heavily risk 
a flow that falls flat. Too many of these, and you risk a product that 
falls flat. 
•	 “Awkward UI” is a missing loading indicator. It’s forgetting to tell 
your customer where something went wrong (bonus points for 
doing so with a scary error message). It’s a graph that looks weird 
with only a few data points. It’s a linear snap into place when a new 
piece of data is introduced.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  177
•	 Awkward UI can be alleviated with the UI stack. The UI stack 
is a combination of five states of interface design—ideal, empty, 
error, partial, and loading—and how a customer moves seam­
lessly between each state.
•	 Design for ergonomics with the Thumb Zone. It’s a heat map of 
sorts—a best guess for how easy it is for our thumbs to tap areas 
on a touch screen.
Do This Now
•	 Which pieces of your product’s interface are jolting and scary? 
Apply the principles of the UI stack to every screen of your user 
flows. See what you’re missing, and what you can make more 
communicative. 
•	 Apply the Thumb Zone overlays to your product’s designs. How 
many of your product’s primary controls rest in the easy-to-reach 
areas? 
•	 Rethink what you know about layouts. Adapt them to the various 
devices used by your customer base. Refer to Luke Wroblewski’s 
excellent “Responsive Navigation” piece for inspiration.*
•	 It might be worth conducting your own study of your customer 
base. How do you observe them holding their phones? What’s the 
context in which they’ll be using your product, and what are their 
hands doing?

I just wanted to start out by talking about a post you wrote awhile ago 
entitled “On Being a Designer and a Developer: Not Quite Unicorn Rare.”* 
You have this very lucid, clear way of breaking down what can be fuzzy, 
multidisciplinary roles required of a designer and a developer.
Obviously people are very interested in this intersection between design 
and development. I wanted to ask you what led you to your conclusions, 
where you talk about how good designers and good developers have a lot 
in common. I would just love to walk through that thought process.
Sure. It’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a long time, albeit not 
super clearly, I would say. Partially because I’d always wondered if it was an 
OK goal, because I was on the fence between design and development. I 
wanted to do design, but the only way to really accomplish that was to build 
these things myself.
When you’re a freelance web developer and you’re a one-stop shop for a 
client, you have no choice but to do both sides. Once I had that skill set, I 
was thinking, am I allowed to pitch myself this way? Is that something that 
even, people will respond to, or they just won’t believe me out of hand? It’s 
not a real thing to be both designer and developer.
It’s been a struggle, of course, but I think what really cracked it open for 
me, I’d say, was that Austin Bales talk that I referenced actually in the post.† 
I had this idea, actually—the diagram came way before the post. The post 
grew around the original diagram, which is this spectrum.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  179
I was thinking what is true about the way people consider design and devel-
opment being diametrically opposed.
I think that it’s like he said, that in some cases it is an artist versus, I don’t 
know—I can’t come up with a good example. What did he say? He said 
barista and rocket scientist, I think...
Because all the examples I could come up with actually still had stuff in com-
mon. I was about to say an artist or blacksmith or something. That doesn’t 
actually apply, because a blacksmith is both.
After just listening to his talk, I was thinking yeah, the reason you can be 
both is not because you can be two people—because you can’t. There’s a 
limit to how much time you have and how good you can be at anything, 
really. But because there’s so much overlap, and I think of the skills required 
of making you a good, professional-level designer and developer, because 
they overlap so much, I think you can do both. It’s to your benefit if you can 
do a little bit of both.

180  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
Then I think that leaves the last problem of getting other people to believe, 
or seeing how that fits in the general marketplace. Because part of the 
problem is you can only be both of these people when you’re in a small 
development shop, a small startup, a one-man operation.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  181
Each person has a certain level of skill in the designer and/or developer sub-
ject areas, where many of the skills and habits that would make you excel in 
either area would help in both. People may have a tendency to lean towards 
one area over the other, but no one has a “type” that would prevent them 
from learning and improving as a designer or a developer. What matters is 
the time and effort put into learning.
Once you get into a larger company where people start to specialize, it’s 
not something you can really pull off successfully as far as selling to other 
people.
Yeah, and that last point’s interesting, because I’ve always had an urge to 
be like “Oh wait, no, no, I can do both.” Is there a point where you have to 
be boxed in? How do you deal with that?
See, that’s the thing. The way I see it is the reason I put that professional 
level and that world-class level on there was because I think you can get to 
a professional level, and you can be really good at both. But if you want to 
be really world-class, you have to skew in one direction.
That’s because world-class musicians, they have one instrument. You know 
what I mean?
They can play multiple ones, but they’re known for this one instrument. I 
think it’s the same deal with being a designer or developer. To really get to 
a really, really high level, you need to have an in-depth knowledge of your 
medium.
There’s the principles and all that stuff, and a lot of that overlaps, but to be 
really, really good, you have to know your medium. You have to be in that 
community. You have to stay up on the latest trends and this, that, and the 
other. It’s pretty difficult to do both of those things at the same time.
You can be professional and you can even do both at work, but I would say 
I started more as doing frontend stuff actually at Squarespace, and not as 
much design stuff. Now I’ve flipped the ratio.
It is difficult to switch modes mentally, from more convergent thinking to 
divergent thinking. You need time when you’re doing design. How do I 
describe it?
Some things are different enough that it’s difficult to switch back and forth 
or do both simultaneously. Both of these skill sets can be stored in the same 
person, but you’re going to be using each, you’re going to be using only one 
at a time, and then switching back and forth as you go.

182  |   DESIGNING PRODUCTS PEOPLE LOVE
The things that’ll make you good at one will also make you good at the 
other. What I mean there is, think of the example of something like staying 
up late and coding. You can hammer on a problem and just keep going into 
all hours of the night, and work on this development problem. It’s totally 
the opposite, I think, for design. Where you have to be in a sort of mindset 
where staying up late or doing any of that isn’t really going to help you past 
a certain point.
I guess the same is true in some respects about development. You’re put-
ting yourself in a different place creatively when you’re working through a 
design problem versus working through a development problem.
Switching back and forth between those two kinds of problem solving is, 
a single person can do it, but in order to do both of those things well—for 
example, at your job, on a continuing basis, you have to do a couple days of 
one and then a couple days of the other. Not “I do this for an hour and do 
that for an hour” kind of thing.
You’ve definitely got this thirst for research, real raw research, about 
behavior and the effect of aesthetics on trust and even usability. What 
are you dialing into these days? Or do you have any authors or professors 
or thinkers that you like to track? What kind of areas do you spend time 
investing in and soaking up?
Part of this is a result that psychology was part of the curriculum, but once 
you know a couple of these basic sorts of heuristics and tendencies that 
people have, they come up again and again in design. You’ve got to keep 
your eyes open for other indications of that same sort of thing happening.
It is a good idea to keep an eye on, I guess, published psychology journals. 
Really, a good way to get overviews actually of what you might want to read 
more into is some of those pop psychology books like Malcolm Gladwell.
I think I started back in the day with Don Norman’s Emotional Design, and 
that really got me thinking of how some very basic animal tendencies we 
have should inform the way we design.* 
It’s like what makes economics interesting. If you make the assumption that 
humans are rational, there’s a bunch of conclusions that follow. Real life 
will show you, and any economist will tell you, that humans aren’t rational. 
There’s loss aversion, and there’s all this not mathematical stuff that we do 
because of how we feel emotionally.

 The Mechanics of Interface Design   |  183
[I was reading Jim Collins’s Good to Great, where] he talks about the 
Hedgehog Concept—which is this one vision to align the company with, but 
it’s not really just the fact that there’s a vision to align the company with, but 
the fact that there’s this vision you actually can execute, and you guys are 
passionate about it and this, that, and the other.
It’s easy to see how that idea connects to what you would find in a normal 
design process when you’re searching for insight about what you should 
do with a particular feature. Like what does the product that this feature’s 
going to be in represent to the user? What can be the best connection 
between this new feature and what already exists in the product and what 
people are familiar with?
It all wraps together. It’s like different facets of the same idea, trying to fig-
ure out what people are about and what they’re motivated by. Reading any 
of those books in general that are informed by—they have good analysis, 
but they also have good data. That just does, I think, wonders for your abil-
ity to think about the craft.
That reminds me of another book. It’s a book called The Humane Interface, 
by Jef Raskin.* 
What he says, basically—what the whole book is really about—is that an 
interface should be humane. Humane means that it is considerate of human 
frailties. It’s responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties.
One thing that he says in the book somewhere, it’s like, “consider your 
users smart but busy.” He also says that you should always be focusing your 
design efforts on intermediates, because everyone goes towards interme-
diacy. Beginners don’t like to feel like beginners. No one likes to feel incom-
petent, like they don’t know what they’re doing.
They want to quickly blast by being “noobs” to knowing what’s up, being 
intermediate. Then experts, you need to be able to do expert things, and if 
you use this thing every day all the time, you need to be able to do things 
quickly. Really, most people are going to be somewhere in the middle.
Even if you’re an expert, the minute you start spending time away from this 
thing and doing something else, you don’t use it for a while, you regress 
back into being an intermediate. That’s where your main design efforts 
should be.

He’s got so many great things in there, but that is a guiding principle I 
always think of. Making the interface humane, such that yes, your users are 
smart, but no, they’re not always paying attention. They’re not always ready 
to commit X part of their life to this random application. Maybe they have 
children, or they have so many more important things in the grand scheme 
of things.
You need to be OK with that. Sometimes you have to let some decisions that 
you like go. I don’t know what a good example is, but sometimes, you want 
to make this whole thing a little bit more aesthetically pleasing, so you’re 
going to remove the text and just have this icon that’s abstract there.
It’ll probably work fine, and people will try it out. They’ll figure out what it 
does. The other option is, don’t do that. It may be a little bit more on the 
interface, but it’s perfectly clear; they don’t have to think about it. They 
don’t have to wonder what’s going on. You don’t have to give them that 
feeling of them not being good at using this interface by just putting this 
label there, and letting them [flounder].
There’s a fine line, I guess, between not patronizing someone, but also real-
izing that they’re not necessarily a student of interfaces, or interested in 
learning at all. Because they just want to get X thing done before they move 
on with their life.
The thing to focus on is that 100 percent of your users are humans. While 
technology is changing really, really rapidly, human motivations basically 
haven’t at all. Like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, that’s still the same.
Designing around that, the closer you are to the base level of what humans 
desire, the more timeless it’ll be. This idea of immediate feedback of some 
sort with tactility and the idea of affordance where something, while look-
ing at it, it tells you what it does, that’s so basic that the better it is at doing 
that, the longer it’ll last.
I love that quote: the more you focus on human desire, the more timeless 
it’ll be.
The closer [your product] is to that, fulfilling some sort of basic human 
need, the longer it’ll last. And it’s funny, because you see the same design 
thing happening over and over again in each new technology.

Visual Design Principles

The idea of visual weight is fairly intuitive. Some things look 
“heavier” than others in a layout. They draw your attention 
more easily. And that idea is valuable to a UX designer. Your 
job is to help users notice the things that matter. And it is 
equally important not to distract the users from their goals.
By adding visual “weight” to certain parts of your design, you 
increase the chance that a user will see them and you change 
where their eyes will go next. Remember: visual weight is 
relative. All visual principles are about comparing a design 
element to whatever is around it.
So, without further ado, I would like to introduce you to the stars 
of the UX Crash Course: The Rubber Ducks! *applause here*
Contrast
The difference between light things and dark things is called 
contrast. The more distinguishable a light thing is compared 
to a dark thing, the “higher” the contrast.
In UX, you want to give important things higher contrast, like 
the duck in the center. In this case, most of the image is light, 
so a dark duck is more 
noticeable. If the image 
were mostly dark, the 
lighter duck would be more 
noticeable.
If these were buttons, more 
people would click the dark 
one than if all the buttons 
were the same color.
LESSON 51
Visual Weight (Contrast and Size)
This lesson is the first of five visual principles that will help you direct 
the user’s attention. Some parts of your design are more important 
than others, so we have to help users notice the important stuff. 
112   
Visual Design Principles

As a general rule, you want more important things to be 
bigger than less important things. This creates a visual “hier­
archy” on the page and makes it easier to scan, but it also 
allows you to choose what the user notices first. That’s why 
it’s wrong to “make the logo bigger,” unless you want users 
to stare at your logo instead of buying something.
Depth and Size
In the real world, we notice things that are close to us more 
than things that are far away.
In the digital world, bigger things are perceived to be closer, 
like the middle duck in the second illustration, and something 
that is smaller is perceived to be farther away (like the blurry 
duck in the back.) If the ducks were all the same 
size, you would probably look at them from 
left to right (assuming you read that way). 
If you use blur effects or shadows 
it just makes the perception of 
depth more realistic. Size has 
this effect even if your 
design looks “flat.”
Lesson 51: Visual Weight (Contrast and Size)    113

LESSON 52
Color
Real life is full of sunlight, artificial light, heat, cold, clothing, brands, 
fashion, and a million other things that affect the way we perceive 
colors. As a UX designer, we might not care about Pantones and 
brand guidelines, but we definitely have to learn about color.
114   
Visual Design Principles

Recede or Advance
The other thing to keep in mind is that colors can be “loud” 
or “quiet.” The second image in Lesson 52 shows a red duck 
and two blueish ones. The red duck almost looks a little 
closer, doesn’t it? It’s not. Something like a “buy” button 
should have a color that makes it jump off the screen. More 
people will click a color that “advances” (comes forward).
On the other hand, sometimes we want things to step back 
so they are visible, but not too distracting, like the two blueish 
ducks. They “recede” (sink backward). This is good for some­
thing like a menu that is always on the screen. If it is always 
yelling at you, that’s unnecessary and it steals focus from 
more important things.
Keep Wireframes Simple
Colorful wireframes just get in the way of the functional 
details. Use colors where they matter, but don’t make your 
wireframes blue like blueprints, or dress them up for clients. It 
makes all discussions about color confusing: “No, the website 
won’t be blue…”
Combine Visual Principles
Color can work really well with the previous lesson about Visual 
Weight. Something big is noticeable, but you can’t miss some­
thing big and red! Make your errors and warning labels red and 
high contrast. Or, if you’re just confirming what the user did, 
something a little smaller in a receding green might be perfect.
There are a few things we can learn about color from the 
Technicolor rubber duckies on the preceding page. As UX 
designers, we usually rock the wireframes in black and white. 
And that’s a good thing! We focus on the function, while the 
UI designers can focus on the look, feel, and style. However, 
sometimes color is function. Like traffic lights, or making the 
color of a popsicle match the flavor. You know, important shit.
Meaning
In the first illustration in this lesson, we see three ducks in 
different colors: blue, yellow, and red. They’re so handsome. 
Immediately, these ducks seem to have different tonality, and 
it is easy to imagine how the colors can change what each 
duck “means.”
If the ducks were buttons, they might be “confirm,” “cancel,” 
and “delete.” If they were indicators on a fuel tank, they 
might represent “full,” “half,” and “empty.” Or if they were 
on a stove:  “cold,” “warm,” and “hot.”
You get the idea: the ducks are identical, but colors change 
the meaning. If you don’t need to indicate something like 
that, let the UI designer choose colors. But if you do, let your 
wireframes do the talking.
PROTIP
Don’t argue with other designers about the specific shade of 
color. In UX, pale red and primary red are both red. That’s all 
you care about.
Lesson 52: Color    115

Western world, you will probably look at them from left to 
right because that’s how we read. If that row of ducks were 
a menu or a list, we would do the same thing. Therefore, you 
could expect more people to click the options on the left, and 
fewer people to click the options on the right.
Who knew we could learn so much from rubber ducks?!
Human brains have a particular talent for patterns and 
sequences. Whenever something in nature happens over and 
over, we will quickly notice. In fact, we don’t just notice, we 
think about those things differently.
The first image shows five identical rubber ducks in a row. We 
don’t see five individual ducks though, we see a row of ducks. 
We treat them as a group or a sequence, and if you live in the 
LESSON 53
Repetition and Pattern-Breaking
One important visual design principles involves the creation 
of patterns to move the user’s eyes to important things. And 
like all good rules, patterns are made to be broken.
116   
Visual Design Principles

This might seem simple and obvious, but when you apply that 
principle to your designs—or your dance routines—it can make 
people notice the important buttons, options, or pop stars.
Be careful: pattern-breaking can also lead the user’s eyes 
away from other important things. Before you can break a 
pattern, you have to make one.
Combine Your Principles
To make a pattern or a sequence, keep visual weight and 
color consistent. The user’s eye will start at one end and 
follow the pattern to the other end. To break the pattern, just 
switch it up in the place where you want to add focus. Make 
the “Register Now” button an unexpected color, size, shape, 
or style, and watch your clicks go up overnight!
Breaking a Pattern
The second image shows the same five rubber ducks (still 
lookin’ good, aren’t they?) but this time one of them has 
gone solo. We’ll call her Beyoncé.
That changes everything. Now we see a row of four (jealous) 
ducks, and Beyoncé is alone, in the spotlight. She woke up 
like that! It is hard not to focus on Beyoncé, even though all 
five ducks are equally majestic creatures.
Now, if that were a menu, the middle option would get far 
more clicks than before because our eyes fixate on it. Also, 
those clicks would be stolen from the left options, so the left 
options would be less popular than before (although probably 
still more popular than the far-right option).
That’s a powerful thing to know.
Lesson 53: Repetition and Pattern-Breaking    117

Line Tension
The first image shows eight ducks in a row. We don’t see 
eight individual ducks; we see a line. That’s line tension. The 
perception of a line or a “path” when there isn’t one. Our 
eyes will follow the path to see where it goes. Super useful.
Are you tired of the ducks yet? I didn’t think so. 
Visual “tension” is a concept that seems very elementary, 
but you’d be amazed how useful it can be. Our brains are a 
little too good at seeing patterns where they don’t exist. As a 
designer you can use that.
LESSON 54
Line Tension and Edge Tension
Repetition, as we learned in the last lesson, creates a pattern. 
However, certain types of repetition can also create the 
perception of shapes that affect where the user’s eyes will go.
118   
Visual Design Principles

The result can be “shapes.”
In the second image, I have arranged the ducks so they 
appear to form the corners of a box. You could see 12 ducks, 
or four groups of 3 ducks, but your mind really wants to see 
the box, so it does. Furthermore, now we can put things 
“inside” the box (like more ducks!), or in the spaces between 
If we break that path—like any broken pattern—the gap 
steals more focus.
Edge Tension
So far, we have assumed there is only one line. But what if we 
create line tension using more than one line?
Lesson 54: Line Tension and Edge Tension    119

Combine Your Principles
In this lesson I have left the “tension” gaps blank, but you 
don’t have to. You can also use color to create a path like a 
gradient on a list of items. Or you can add visual weight to 
a group of elements by treating them like one shape instead 
of separate pieces. It’s a great way to direct the user’s eyes 
without adding any more things to a layout!
the corners. Similar to line tension, edge tension brings focus 
to the gaps.
Layout-wise, this can be an excellent way to put more focus 
on something small, like a label. Or you can create visual 
paths leading to the button you want people to click. Vintage 
ads use this technique often to put a small logo in focus. And 
conveniently, it makes a layout feel simpler and more cohe­
sive because a path or a box is only one mental thing, but 12 
separate ducks is too much awesome to handle.
120   
Visual Design Principles

•	 If you see motion, the far-right duck might be leading.
Those six ducks are identical. Only the alignment creates these 
perceptions. Buttons with similar functions can be aligned. 
Alignment
In the first image you see a group of six stunningly beautiful 
ducks, but you also see a lot of relationships, because of the 
way they are aligned:
•	 We see two rows.
•	 The far-left and far-
right ducks seem to be 
separated.
•	 The two center ducks seem 
the most organized.
•	 All ducks seem to be going in 
the same direction.
•	 If you see motion, the far-left duck 
might be falling behind.
LESSON 55
Alignment and Proximity
The last design principle you will learn about is how 
to add order and meaning to elements of your design 
without adding any more elements. It might sound 
subtle, but it affects everything you see, every day.
Lesson 55: Alignment and Proximity    121

Different levels of content can be aligned. Information can 
be in a grid of rows and columns like a spreadsheet to create 
complex meaning.
Proximity
The closeness or distance between two objects creates a 
feeling of those objects being related or unrelated. That dis­
tance is called proximity.
In the second image, you see six identical ducks that are not 
aligned horizontally or vertically, but you definitely see two 
groups. The ducks in each group seem together, like a team 
or a family. The only thing creating that perception is their 
proximity.
In your designs, put related elements closer together and 
unrelated elements farther apart. For example: a headline, a 
block of text, and a button that are all related to one action—
like a purchase or an app download—are usually designed 
like a “package.” That allows the user to understand that they 
go together without reading anything.
122   
Visual Design Principles

Motion Is Noticed First
If you have ever been disturbed by a vibrating banner or a 
jumping button, then you understand how motion can draw 
your attention. If you made a list of the things your brain 
notices, in order of priority, motion would be first. But, a little 
goes a long way. If you make a vibrating banner or a jumping 
button (which are really annoying to click, by the way) I will 
hunt you down and… well… let’s just say it won’t be pretty.
If Motion Makes People Wait, It’s Bad
Before you start designing amazing transitions between 
screens, and smooth animated buttons, and parallax gravity 
in your scrolling, think about the user. If the user is trying to 
navigate, or if they know what is coming, or if they have to 
see this animation a hundred times every time they use your 
site or app, you might be doing more harm than good.
Animations take time to show, and making users wait quickly 
gets frustrating. Even worse than waiting, sometimes anima­
tions make things hard to read, or they distract users from the 
content and buttons you want them to read and click.
LESSON 56
Using Motion for UX
In digital design, it is becoming more and more common to include 
animation or moti0on design as part of the UX. It’s a stylish detail, 
but in UX, you care about more than style. Motion is a tool.
Lesson 56: Using Motion for UX    123

the “end of the line.” If you are using motion to highlight key 
features or tell users where to go, straight lines are a good 
choice.
Straight lines point in a direction
Different types of motion will do different things to the user’s 
eyes. If you make something move in a straight line, the user’s 
brain will anticipate where it’s going and the user will look at 
124   
Visual Design Principles

Curved lines make people follow the curve
However, if you want to lead users around the screen—like 
when you’re explaining your app for the first time—curved 
motion will make their eyes stick to the path and stop where 
the animation stops.
Lesson 56: Using Motion for UX    125


1. 
Why service design? 
 
 
 
 
Service? Product? Experience! 
 
Many folks make a big fuss about the difference between services and products (or goods), and 
where exactly the distinction lies. “If my company offers it, it’s our product” says one. “It’s only a 
product if you can drop it on your foot”, says another. Within service dominant logic1 you will 
hear that tangible products are merely a form of services - they have been called “service 
avatars”. Or the Jobs to be Done approach suggests that customers “hire” a certain product or 
service to get a specific job done2.  
 
What all these discussions about products and services have in common is that customers don’t 
give a hoot. They pay money (or spend time, or give attention, or exchange something else they 
value, like data or permission) and they want us to help them, to solve their problems, to realise 
their goals and to give them a great experience.  
 
The digital revolution has made customers’ demand for valued experiences even more 
powerful. Where they were previously often forced to take what they could get locally or find in 
the newspaper, customers now have a huge choice. Indeed, it is often easier to buy from the 
other side of the planet than from the store across town. They have many channels for 
information or for purchase, even within one provider, and will switch between them at their 
convenience. They have more information, with price comparisons, alternative sources, trusted 
reviews and a wealth of other data just a screen away.  
 
Social media amplifies this change, as customers seize the opportunity to share experiences 
with potentially millions of others. And they trust the words of peers far more than expensive 
advertising campaigns. In a Forrester study, 73% of customers trusted the recommendations of 
friends and family, while only 19% trusted direct communication by organizations3. Business-to-
business services may be less sensitive to social media, but word of mouth fulfills the same task 
here, with some sources describing WOM as the dominant factor in as much as a 91% of 
purchasing decisions.4 So when an organization gets it wrong, the world will be told - and 
believe what they hear.

This makes a difference to the bottom line, as plenty of studies have shown; in 2013, Forbes 
estimated that poor customer experiences led to 83 billion dollars of lost business in the US 
alone5; companies who excel at customer experience outperform the market6, are more likely to 
be recommended by customers and more likely to see customers return and buy again7; and 
most customers are willing to pay more if they are sure of a better experience8. It’s not hard to 
understand - with two coffee shops in your street selling the same coffee at the same price, the 
one with the better customer experience gets your regular custom. 
 
It seems obvious that customers know what they want, so why do so many organizations get it 
wrong? They are made up of intelligent people who are doing good jobs, so why do they 
infuriate, anger, confuse, disappoint or simply fail to impress customers?   
 
They trip up because for years they have been focusing brilliantly on the wrong part of their 
value proposition. To understand this, we have to understand that an experience is made up of 
many layers. 
 
In your childhood, you might have played a party game called “Pass the Parcel”. Before the 
party, a mystery gift would be wrapped in gift paper, then wrapped again and again. Layers of 
paper would be added until it became impossible to guess more than the basic form of what 
was inside. The excited kids playing the game would unwrap layers and layers, until one lucky 
child revealed the contents.9 
The offerings made by organizations - the products and services we want - are wrapped in 
much the same way (Figure 1-1). The outermost wrapping is the behavior, manner and tone of 
the staff member (or technological interface) we are dealing with. Under this is a layer of subject 
and system expertise made of the knowledge and experience of that person. Then there is a 
layer of processes carried out by front-line staff, for example the sales or refund routines.  Next 
we have the systems and tools run by the organization - logistics systems, billing, Point of Sale 
systems.  And at the core is the offering itself, like a telephone contract or a pair of running 
shoes. 
As a customer, you are like the children playing Pass the Parcel. The only way to get to the 
offering you want is through all those layers - they all contribute to your experience. 
Disinterested staff, misinformed employees, byzantine processes or clunky systems can all 
make it less satisfying to buy or interact with the offering, making it simply less valuable to you. 
 
But companies are traditionally focused heavily on the content at the core of the parcel, and 
perhaps the few innermost layers which let them deliver it. They concentrate on technical and 
operational excellence and they want to “get it right”. To them, their job is to optimize the nuts 
and bolts of their activity - like the hamburger restaurant who invests heavily in new recipe

development. Or they work hard at sales, pushing the message that they have just what the 
customer needs to solve his problem - like the bank who works hard presenting a consistent 
image of trustworthiness. 
 
But is this core offering what the customer 
really cares about? In a huge study in the 
early 2000s, researchers asked thousands 
of patients to list the factors which led to 
their hospital stay being satisfying or 
dissatisfying10. Now, most of us would 
expect the “medical outcome” - the 
successful healing of the complaint - to be 
one of the most important things to 
patients. After all, “healing” is the k
proposition of hospitals, it’s why people go 
there. But in the study, all the top ten 
satisfaction factors were non-medical. Each 
top factor was experiential, ranging from 
things like information flow to complaint 
handling, empathic and polite nursing staff, 
patient inclusion in decision making, a 
pleasant hospital environment and - top of 
the list - having the feeling of being cared 
for by a well motivated team. The highest 
factor with any relation to healing was at position 14, and that was the very experiential issue of 
pain management.

Of course if someone did not experience a good medical outcome, the situation might be 
different. When you get sicker, the medical part of the experience becomes imminently 
important. But until then, it seems that the core competency of the hospital - healing - was taken 
for granted by the patients.11 It’s not hard to imagine this other situations. You don’t talk about 
your hotel room having a door, window or bed until one is missing. You don’t rate your bank on 
their arithmetic skills until they mischarge you. And at that point, it becomes an issue. But 
otherwise, customers measure us on other factors. 
 
So at the hamburger restaurant, eaters actually care more about a warm greeting than an 
exciting new burger recipe.  At the bank, clients worry more about the awful log-in process at

the website than about trusting the institution12. It seems that we are less influenced by the core 
offering, but more by the layers of experience around it. So how can we make that experience 
better? 
 
Silos 
 
Since industrialization, through movements like Taylorism13 and TQM14, organizations have 
focused on operational excellence and efficiency. In a mechanistic paradigm, they have 
understood their activities as a series of operational process, and looked at optimizing each 
individual step, usually in terms of costs. Whole organizational units (we often say “silos”) have 
been constructed around work functions which make sense to the company, with a dedicated 
set of business tools set up to understand, track and manage these functions. It sometimes 
seems that anything outside the basic offering and the processes necessary to deliver the core 
value is mostly seen as an overhead, a cost center, or as a “soft factor” - something to be 
streamlined, cut away, perhaps left to chance or the nice guys in advertising and HR. 
 
So these organizational silos reflect many of the “layers” of experience discussed above, putting 
them in the hands of separate teams. For example, when I buy my running shoes the process 
the salesperson guides me through might be designed by the Sales department, and her soft 
skills and specialist knowledge trained by an education system run by HR. She will use sale and 
stock systems developed by IT, explain a returns procedure drawn up by Legal and finally sell 
me a pair of shoes designed by R&D or bought in by Purchasing. The situation becomes even 
more knotted when my relationship with the company grows longer and more silos come into 
play.   
 
All these people are good at their jobs, so their work inside their silos becomes more efficient 
from year to year while helpless customers bounce between them. Of course, there are calls 
and efforts to work together - but how exactly should this happen? People in the different sub-
organizations have their own viewpoints on what is important, their own measures of success, 
their own KPIs (key performance indicators).  There are tools like process diagrams which can 
indicate the contributions of different departments to the process, but these generally only show 
the customer if he is necessary for part of the process, or even miss him out completely. They 
can be used to promote efficient cooperation between silos, but not the understanding of the 
effect on the consumer. And crucially, there are many parts of the customer journey that are 
important to the customer, but which do not appear at all on these visualizations. These are the 
parts of the journey which are not directly influenced by the organization, but which are an

important part of the customer experience - like waiting, third party reviews, or discussions with 
friends.  
 
So, put a cross-functional team in a room together, and where should they start? Usually the 
basic tool of such cooperative attempts is meetings, and the teams are faced with the collosal 
task of reconciling different worldviews and different languages by basically talking about it. It is 
no wonder that cross-functional cooperation is extraordinarily difficult, as each delegate honestly 
argues for his own point of view using his own specialized language. 
 
How can we make it easier for these people to cooperate and create value together, so that 
each department sees the results as their own and is invested in their success? And how can 
we help them to orchestrate experiences across their silos, working together to create real 
satisfaction? 
 
Innovation  
 
Most organizations see innovation as something which is both necessary and desirable.  It is 
often closely linked to generating a USP (unique selling proposition), but the innovation might be 
in terms of creating unique offerings, in the internal processes which enable those offerings, or 
even in the business model of the organization. Whichever of these is true, the need for 
innovation is driven by a changing (business) world, and a general ubiquity of technology and 
information which makes it easier than ever to copy. If my offering has value and is easy to 
reproduce, then it will be copied directly or indirectly, legally or illegally by people who have not 
had my development costs and can therefore offer it cheaper. Even if they offer it at the same 
price, the result is the same - commoditization. There will be two or more similar offerings on the 
market, and a price war will loom. 
In various models of customer satisfaction15, it’s clear that aspects of an offering which are 
initially seen as delightful soon become expected. One vivid example is wireless internet in 
hotels in developed countries in the early 21st century. Initially, travellers were surprised and 
delighted to be able to use wifi in hotels and were happy to pay for it. Soon, they expected to 
find it in every hotel, and began to grumble that the price was higher than at home. As we write, 
with wifi available for free in coffee shops, cabs and budget buses, hotel guests “compare Wi-Fi 
to hot water, electricity or air”16 and are often annoyed or angry to see a charge for it on their 
hotel bill. An excitement or delight factor (according to followers of the Kano model (Figure 1-2)) 
has degraded to a performance factor and then a basic or threshold factor.

All this means that many organizations prioritize innovation as a key success factor in their 
work. The innovation might be evolutionary (incremental) or revolutionary (disruptive), and we 
need techniques for both of these. And as service becomes more and more visibly important for 
every firm, the focus of innovation turns that way. So todays’ companies look for ways to 
understand the needs of their customers in a way which will provide useful insights and spark 
interesting ideas. And they need a way to work on those ideas in cross-silo teams, diversifying, 
filtering, testing and evolving them until they are implemented as innovations - to the offering, 
the operations or even the business model. 
 
What are organizations doing about it? 
 
Many companies today understand the importance of customer experience to their success. 
And this awareness is growing fast. A study by Gartner Research predicted that 89% of 
companies expected to compete mostly on the basis of customer experience by 2016 – in 
comparison to meager 36% in 2010.17 
 
One of the first things which organizations do when they understand the importance of customer 
experience is to take measures to track it - or rather, to track customer satisfaction. The most 
visible tools used are online and offline surveys or the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in particular, 
                                                 
17 Sorofman, Jake (2014): "Gartner Surveys Confirm Customer Experience Is the New Battlefield", 
Gartner for Marketing Leaders, online: http://blogs.gartner.com/jake-sorofman/gartner-surveys-confirm-
customer-experience-new-battlefield/ 

with thousands of organizations regularly asking “How likely is it that you would recommend our 
company/product/service to a friend or colleague?” This is a valuable metric, but it has the 
challenge of so many quantitative measurements: when your NPS slumps, it tells you that you 
have a problem, but it does not tell why you have one. It tells you how big your problem is, but 
not how to fix it or how to innovate.  
 
 
 
NPS and similar metrics can surely help show problem areas, and especially show that silo 
thinking is a factor in many poor experiences. But there is an old adage that “weighing the 
goose will not make it fatter”. Organizations are now looking for new, reliable and scalable ways 
to move beyond measurement and innovate experiences strategically across silos. Increasingly, 
they turn to what we call service design. 
 
Why a service design approach? 
 
There are many ways to create or improve the value generated by an organization. People 
working on this challenge might call what they do service engineering, or marketing, quality, or 
simply management. A few of them - a growing minority - refer to this work as service design. 
They share a certain outlook and often a common toolset (see chapter X). 
 
Strictly speaking, service design is a particular approach to working with services (and products 
within service ecosystems) which adopts the mindset and iterative workflow of the design 
process, combining an active, iterative approach with a flexible and relatively lightweight set of 
tools borrowed from marketing, branding, user experience and elsewhere18. 
 
It is this patchwork background which makes service design powerful. As a design discipline it is 
focused on solving the right problem, so it starts by investigating the needs of the user or 
customer.  It is inquiring and inquisitive, using a range of mostly qualitative research methods to 
explore the “how and why” of the opportunity space. Understanding needs, instead of jumping 
straight to a “solution”, makes true innovation possible19.  
 
Next, service design uses a prototyping approach to test possible solutions quickly and cheaply 
while generating new insights and ideas. With this strong emphasis on iterations of research 
and prototyping, service design projects have a firm foundation in reality. They are built on 
research and testing, not on opinion or (rapidly outdated) authority.  And the iterative approach 
makes decision-making in service design a low-stakes activity. Instead of worrying about getting

business software company, USA 

it right first time, we can evolve a range of options, and rely on the structured process of 
prototyping and testing to judge and improve our work20.  
 
Many organizations are looking for an effective way of working which makes it easy for people 
with different backgrounds and responsibilities to work together meaningfully and productively.21 
They are looking for a “silo breaker”. Because the tools of service design have been filtered 
through a design mentality, they are visual, fast, lightweight and easy to grasp. They form a 
common language for collaboration, so cross-functional teams can quickly pick them up and get 
on with it.22  The tools can look very simplistic at first sight - they make no effort to encompass 
the entire complexity of a service system (there are already excellent tools for that). Instead, 
they filter complexity through the lens of various customer experiences23. This makes the 
approach very powerful: even complex multichannel services become manageable for the team 
when they can understand them on both a practical and a human, empathic level.24 
 
Service design is an intensely practical activity, and this makes it inherently holistic. To create 
valuable experiences, service designers must get to grips with the backstage25 activities and 
business processes which enable the front stage success, and address the implementation of 
these processes. They must tackle the end-to-end experience of multiple stakeholders, not just 
individual moments. And they must find a way to make it pay, considering the business needs of 
the organization and the appropriate use of technology.

23 TEXT BOX: Why I chose service design: “Many service design tools are mind hacks that help us 
reframe problems in a way humans are built to deal with. We shape clouds of slippery data into human 
forms and into visual stories which we can understand from any viewpoint - whether technical, specialist 
or simply empathic. Instead of designing complex systems directly, we try to answer simple questions of 
“how might we…?” And rather than trying to interpret each other’s words, we communicate and advance 
on multiple channels through building prototypes. All these hacks make it easier for us to concentrate on 
the content instead of the tools, and  open up our work to a wider group of people and their insights. The 
result is better services.” - Adam, coauthor 
24 TEXTBOX; Why Service Design?: “The challenge I was facing was to build a coherent multi-channel 
service. I needed a way to visualise the stages and parts of the service in order to identify and 
communicate the issues, as well as trying to improve matters for all concerned. Service design answered 
all of this through its tool set, specifically service blueprints, user journeys and stakeholder maps, and 
allowed me to bring others in to understand the overall picture. Service Design also helped set a base for 
research that was needed and then provided guidance on how to distill that information to a manageable 
format.” - Stuart Congdon, infrastructure systems executive, UK 
 
25 “Backstage” refers to processes or action which are normally not visible to the customer, such as 
checking in the store room or emptying the trash. “Frontstage”, then, refers to the parts of the process 
which a customer can see. 

With these characteristics, it is no wonder that many organizations are implementing service 
design methods under whatever name, and that many more are employing service design 
agencies. Examples include household names like McDonalds, Coca Cola, Lufthansa and 
Volkswagen; professional services providers like Accenture and PWC; banks like Capital One or 
Barclays; energy providers like E.ON or British Gas; and public services like the BBC and 
Victorian Government. 
 
Summary 
 
Service design is a way of working which can help organizations provide better end-to-end 
customer experiences across multiple channels. This improved experience often leads to 
success. Service design’s iterative approach uses research to focus on user needs, and 
prototyping to test and evolve possible solutions before making large investments. It balances 
the experiential, operational and business needs of an organization in a robust but 
approachable manner, offering a common language and toolset which can be used across 
whole organizations.

Good Research = Good Questions 
I don’t pretend we have all the answers. But the questions are certainly worth thinking 
about. – Arthur C. Clarke 
 
Research has always been a part of product development and design, as showcased by the 
previous chapter. In today’s world, the products being developed no longer are restricted 
to a single community, population, or geographical location. Modern products span the 
globe, sometimes in very unexpected ways. A product that starts as a game can, in a 
year’s time change an entirely different business like how teams collaborate and 
communicate. For products that have to operate at this scale, research is a core 
component to both short-term success and long-term growth.  
For teams to not only conduct meaningful research, but also collect data that will allow a 
team to quickly iterate their product, they need good questions to ask. If you’ve ever had 
to learn something from another person, you know that asking a “good” question is more 
craft than science. In the following chapter, we will discuss this craft and provide 
methods you can use to create questions that help you learn specific topics, remove 
factors such as personal and unconious bias, and provide a quick exercise you can 
perform to quickly iterate through potential questions that can be asked about how 
someone might want to interact with a product.  
Why are good questions so hard? 
Researchers always struggle when it comes to writing down the questions they need to 
ask their participants. Sure this gets easier over time and as you gain experience, but the 
act of writing an interview guide or test plan never gets “easy”. At the end of the day we 
are all human and we are susceptible to our own weakness and limitations. 
The deck is stacked against us when you start to consider social, personal, professional, 
and sometimes logistical factors that can inhibit our ability to have a conversation with 
someone else. Predicting all these factors before research even starts is no small feat. This 
in turn makes writing down lines of inquiry that will result in good data that the team can

use seem daunting. But, you have to start somewhere and iterate as you learn what 
questions work and which fall flat. To help with this, first we need to understand what 
role questions fulfill when conducting any type of research.  
Introduction to the role of questions in research 
It’s hard to conduct research when you don’t know what question needs to be answered. 
Every research effort starts with you needing to know why something happens, what 
people do in certain circumstances, and how they perform key tasks. To find answers to 
these questions, we must find people to talk to and ask them things that get to the heart of 
the matter. Without this, we would be making wild guesses and shooting in the dark.  
While often tempting, this degree of freedom leads to failure and your product never 
seeing the light of day.  
How good questions go wrong 
We can’t tell you how many times we’ve written a question down and thought “This is it! 
This will get us some awesome information from people” and have it fall flat during a 
session. This happens to all researchers and it will happen to you. And that’s ok! Bad 
questions can be mitigated through the planning phase if you know what makes a 
question go bad. The following are types of questions that can lead any research astray. 
Leading Questions 
It’s easy for you to get caught up in the excitement of research and getting a chance to 
hear from real people about how they want to use your product or what they think of it. 
This excitement can trick you into asking questions that give participants a clue, or 
directly point them, at the type of answer you’re looking for. These are called Leading 
Questions, and they can really hamper not only your research session but also the data 
you collect. Research participants want to be helpful and they know they’ve been selected 
out of a pool of people to provide some kind of value to you and your team. Since they 
are already primed to help, if you ask a question that implies the type of answer you want 
from them they are more likely to give you that answer, even if it isn’t something that 
doesn’t really apply to them.  
Shallow Questions 
One of the golden rules of research is never ask yes or no questions. When you’re trying 
to create questions for the first time for an upcoming research effort you’ll find that not 
asking these types of questions is really hard. These types of questions are harmful to 
your research because it gives participants and easy out. Participants don’t have to think 
too deeply to provide you with a response and in their minds they are giving you some 
sort of confirmation that may be of use.  
Personal Bias 
We all have our own personal beliefs about how products work, or how they should 
work. These personal beliefs can sneak into the questions. The only way to avoid this is 
to be removed from the research. While strict practice may suggest not conducting the 
research yourself, we instead recommend developing questions from the point of view of 
the product, the customer, or even from stakeholders of the product. The less “you” there 
is in the interview the better the data will be that you will collect.

Unconscious bias 
Our brains make tons of decisions for us every day, many of which we aren’t even aware 
of. These decisions can be influenced by social norms, personal history, past experiences, 
or expectiations. These types of bias are also the hardest to catch. The danger of 
unconscious bias is taking for granted that the world might not be how we expect it to be 
and actively find ways to question it. You can’t take things at face value, you have to dig 
deeper no matter how uncomfortable that might make you feel. For instance, gender bias 
extists within the workplace because most people aren’t aware that the bias exists in the 
first place. 
Knowing when to break the rules 
If you’re just getting started building out your research skills, it’s important to avoid the 
aforementioned questions. However, once you get a few studies under your belt and the 
art of crafting and asking questions becomes more natural you’ll find that you can use 
leading questions and shallow questions in strategic ways. You can even use a 
participant’s personal and unconscious bias to drive to a deeper conversation about 
people might use a product and that product might impact a person’s life.  
Leading – These are best used when you suspect the response will be opposite to the 
hints you provide in your questioning. You can use leading questions to help build 
trust with a participant and to validate previous comment they might have made that 
maybe wasn’t totally clear.  
Example: How much do your friends and families appreciate photo albums when 
you make make one for them? 
Shallow – When you start a research session, sometimes participants aren’t the most 
comfortable and they need to get used to talking with you and answering your 
questions. Shallow questions give participants that opportunity and can help ease 
someone into the activity so you can get to the good stuff. 
Example: How many times do you log into Facebook in a day? 
Personal Bias – There is something to be said about being a good devils advocate, 
someone who can take the opposite view of a conversation to spark additional 
thought or comments. You can use your personal thoughts and opinions to get to 
deeper conversation by giving the participant something to disagree with.   
Example: Do you think the Cubs actually have a chance at the World Series this 
year? 
  
Years of practice and failure to master 
The only way to practice doing research is by finding people to talk to. The first few 
studies you run won’t be the best, and that’s ok! You will learn something after each 
session, even if every question you ask isn’t the best version of that question. The goal is 
to improve your line of questioning and to find ways to hold a meaningful conversation 
with someone rather than treat research like a verbal questionnaire.  
Both authors have had their fair shares of failing during our early years as a researcher. 
We asked overly leading questions and missed important areas of discussion because we 
didn’t know what we were looking for. But, thanks to mentors providing their feedback 

O’Reilly Media, Inc.

4 
and guidance we eventually overcame these failings. Still today we make mistakes, and 
that’s going to happen, but as long as you have a consistent feedback loop in place you 
too will continue to improve and eventually master the art of research.  
The basic structure of a question 
Now that you know what kinds of questions not to ask, let’s dive into how to write 
questions that do work and will get you the information you want. To start off, we are 
going to cover the overall anatomy of a question and different forms questions can take to 
drive conversations.  
 
The Set Up 
Every question starts off with a purpose. This takes the form of what (description), why 
(explanation), how (process), when (situation), and where (context). It gives the 
participant an idea of the type and, more importantly, the length of response you expect 
out of them.  
Area of inquiry 
This is going to be the subject of what you want to learn about. Is it about your product or 
something about how the product impacts or influences someone life?  
Laddering 
Some responses to your questions will have an automatic “Why?” behind them. Asking 
for a participant to go into more detail or to explain the rationale behind their response is 
known as laddering, and it’s an aspect of a question that helps you get to deeper 
information and potentially impactful stories.

Segway to next question 
The best research sessions are really just a focused conversation between yourself and a 
participant. The best way to make an interview or study session feel more comfortable 
and conversational is to string questions together so the whole session has a beginning, 
middle, and end. While it is helpful to think how each question could set up the following 
question, it is important to keep the discussion fluid, something we will address more in 
Chapters 8 and 9.  
Writing your questions 
It’s time to put the pen to the paper and start generating the list of queries that’ll guide 
your investigations.  To begin, we’re going to reach out to our friend Colin MacArthur on 
how he creates questions to learn about broad and ambigious topics.

IN A FEW WORDS, DESCRIBE YOUR JOB 
I try to figure out how the federal government can better serve its people. Often 
that starts by conducting interviews with people who do (and don’t) use 
government services.  
 
HOW DO YOU BALANCE SPECIFITY AND AMBIGUITY 
IN RESEARCH?   
I spend many of my days planning and conducting interviews with people who 
use government systems, data and services.

Figuring out what we want to learn is the easiest part of my day. The hard part is 
translating our big research questions into good interview questions. We’re often 
trying to answer abstract questions (like “What’s hard about interacting with the 
government”), but abstract interview questions aren’t fruitful. If I ask “What 
was hard about your last interaction with the federal government”” I’ll get some 
confused states, some answers about state governments and a lot of unelaborated 
“It was OK.” 
When we want get at abstract questions, we give interviewees “handles” that 
make them more concrete. A common tactic is asking people to think about a 
recent, significant life change. As they describe what happened, interviews ask 
follow up questions that focus on what we’re interested in (interactions with the 
government). Another approach is giving people specific scenarios and asking 
them to respond. For example, instead of asking people how they feel about the 
government collecting health data, we might provide a couple scenarios for 
discussion. 
The challenge is making handles useful, but not leading. If we started questions 
with very specific questions about particular life events, we could narrow 
conversations and miss unexpected topics. We try to balance making questions 
open (and non-leading) with making them easy to answer. That’s a hard balance 
to find, but the best approach is iterative. Repeatedly asking questions to friends 
and then asking them how hard they were to answer helps me. At the end of the 
day, I’ve succeeded when our questions both surface interesting questions and 
don’t put an enormous burden on the interviewee. 
Relate back to research goals 
Every question that finds its way into your interview guide should tie back to why you’re 
doing research in the first place. Remember, every study seeks to learn more about a few 
key topics or events that relate to your product. If a question won’t, or doesn’t seem to, 
provide information that helps you understand these goals it’s vital that you remove it 
from your line of questioning.  
Example– Learn about how people determine which photos to share with family and 
friends. 
Bad Question – How to do you ensure that you get good composition when you’re out 
taking photos? 
Revised Question – When you’re out taking photos, how do you know a particular shot is 
worth sharing with people?  
Opens up additional areas of discussion 
There are a lot of assumptions made when planning out the questions and discussion 
guide order. Some questions are designed to uncover rabbit holes, lines of conversation 
that diverge from the current topic. These are moments where you’ll go offscript and 
improvise the discussion. Rabbit holes are good to explore as long as you’re getting good 
information from them 
Example – Learn why photography matters to the participant.

Unhelpful Rabbit Hole – My mobile phone just made it so easy to take photos, so I just 
started taking snap shots throughout my day. – Not much here aside from ease of access 
and a low barrier of entry to taking photos. 
Helpful Rabbit Hole – When I was a kid, my neighbor was a photographer and he would 
let me help out in his dark room to develop his shots.  – Lots of potential stories that 
include mentorship and how the participant developed a love for photography.  
Progresses the overall conversation 
We’ve talked about the importance of research sessions feeling more like conversations 
than having someone respond to a verbal questionnaire. To ensure this happens, your 
questions should build upon each other and help guide the participant through a series of 
topics that comes at a natural pacing. Stark changes in conversation can be off putting 
and be harmful to the information you are able to collect. 
Question 1 – What kind of moments do you try to capture when you’re out taking 
photos?   
Question 2 – Which kind of moments do you treasure, or hold dear? 
Question 3 – When do you decide to print a photo for display?  
Question 4 - How often do you change the photos you display? 
How to use different types of questions 
Recall the basic set up of a question – they typically take the form of what (description), 
why (explanation), how (process), when (situation), and where (context). Each of these 
serves a different function and you should have a balanced mix planned across the 
interview guide.  
Process  
Process oriented questions are great openers to research sessions or when you’re 
switching topics. It gives the participant a wide-open area to talk about something they 
have done and how they did it. The benefit to you is that you can produce an improptu 
checklist of things you want to learn more about.  
Example – How do you design a photo album for a friend or family member? 
Explanation 
People say the most interesting things and it’s rare for you to know why they said them. 
By requesting the participant to explain their previous comment using the ladering 
method decribed earlier, you get a deeper view into their world. This is where you can 
find really valuable information. This information could be unexpected and suprising, or 
it could give you insight into exactly why people do certain things with your product.  
Example – Why do you feel that photo albums are still a treasured keepsake in today’s 
world where more and more are digital?

Description 
We all know everyone has her own unique way of looking at the world. Research is one 
of those activities that allow you to collect these points of views and add them to your 
own so you can look at product features and roadmaps from a whole new perspective. 
Example – What makes a photo worthy to go into a photo album? 
Time based 
The moments a participant might use your product can have a lot of influencers. During 
an interview, you can ask the participant to explain what kind of triggers exist for them 
that gets them to pick up your product. You can also get insight into how long people 
tend to spend performing certain actions and how much tolerance they have when 
something goes wrong.  
Example – When do you think photo albums are most appreciated? 
Frustrations/Hurdles 
The motto of a good researcher is “there is no such thing as user error.” One thing you’ll 
learn as you go out and study how people interact with products is many will put the 
blame onto themselves. These are moments of exploration because you can get to the 
source of why errors are made and what potentially were the cause of frustration that 
people experience when things don’t workout for them.  
Example – What do you do when you don’t have enough photos for an album that you’re 
trying to create? 
Ideals/Dreams 
Some say that everyone is a designer these days, but not everyone can design. However, 
the solutions and ideas that particpants share with you can give you insight into the 
hidden problems that you didn’t know existed. Problems are hard to describe, and harder 
to identify. Half-baked solutions are the non-designers way of expressing the problems 
they experience though, and you can collect pseudo-solutions to use as inspiration and 
guidance for your own product.  
Example – If you could, how would you incorporate videos and other forms of media in 
the photo albums you create for your friends and family? 
How to practice asking questions 
You don’t want your first time saying research questions outloud to be in a live research 
session. This is a common mistake made when starting out, but luckily it’s easily 
avoided. You can quickly practice and iterate your questions by performing a few dry 
runs with people around the office. 
Co-workers & Dry-runs 
It’s always a good idea to validate your interview guide with your product team. From the 
product owner all the way down to the engineering team. These are the folks that are 
putting their time and energy into bulding a product and the feedback you get from them 
will help you refine and potentially shift your lines of questioning. It’s also important to 
reach out to co-workers that may not be directly involved with your product by 
conducting a full dry run of an interview with them. Dry runs give you the opportunity to

get used to asking your questions, but they are also situations where you can collect 
constructive feedback that won’t negatively impact the data you collect during a session.   
Exercising Curiosity 
Before we move on, we want to provide you with an exercise we use when creating our 
own questions. This is a quick activity that will allow you to get a ton of questions out of 
your head and allow you to spend more time on the flow of the interview and areas you 
want to explore.  
Step 1 – Grab some sticky notes! 
Sit down somewhere quiet with a wall that supports sticky notes (white boards or any 
other flat non-glossy surface) and just start writing down things you’d like to ask about. 
These could be general topics or specific questions, the important part is you want to get 
as much out of your head as possible without regard of research goals, project needs, 
product strategy, or personal curiosity. Timebox this activity to 5 – 10 mintues, or until 
you’ve stared at a blank sticky note and no new questions come to mind.  
 
Step 2 – Challenge each question 
Get all your sticky notes up on the wall so you can see them in one spot. For each sticky 
notes, ask yourself why you need to ask that question, how does it tie back to your 
research goals, what’s influencing you to inquire about it. Also ask what else could you 
explore that you haven’t considered. Grab new sticky notes and write down anything that 
comes to mind and add it to the wall. If you determine that a sticky note doesn’t tie back 
to the research goals or the inquiry, ask yourself how it could be reframed so it does 
benefit your research efforts. Don’t be afraid to take post-its down entirely.  
 
Step 3 – Inventory time 
Collect all your follow up sticky notes and start to store these in some inventory, be it a 
document, spreadsheet, or mindmapping tool. These follow up stickies are what you’re 
going to use to craft your final list of questions and to guide the order which you’ll ask 
them. While there is no one right tool, the authors often use include Microsoft Excel, 
Boardthing, and Trello.  
 
Step 4 – Practice! 
We’ve already talked about how you can practice your research questions, now’s the time 
to grab that team member or the person down the hall and see how the questions feel and 
iterate as needed.  
Closing and Words of Caution 
Crafting the questions you need to ask is challenging, and it can dissuade many budding 
researchers. Don’t let how hard it is get you down, it’s a natural part of the process when 
it comes to learning a new skill. This is especially true for research.  Every researcher 
you’ve might of heard of from any field went through the same struggles.

In terms of design, what really matters is that you care enough about your product that 
you get out of your own way and reach out to people for help. If there is one thing we’ve 
learned by doing countless research sessions over the years is people who either use, or 
might want to use your product honestly care about its success. They will go on and on 
about what they love and hate about your product, and this is the information that you can 
get nowhere else. 
 
Now that you know how to structure a question to get the best date, it is important to 
recognize that there are many different ways questions can be used in research, and many 
different types of reseach. Over the course of the next two chapters, we will explore two 
main buckets of research: Qualitative and Quantitative research.

Prototyping for Designers 
 
Chapter One: What is a Prototype? 
 
Everything is a prototype. 
Each thing you make or activity you do can be improved, and nothing is ever completely finished. In 
this chapter, I’ll share current views on what constitutes a prototype, how user-centered design 
encourages prototyping, and how to cultivate a culture of prototyping in your workplace. 
 
The Oxford definition of a prototype is: "A first, typical or preliminary model of something, especially 
a machine, from which other forms are developed or copied.”1 The word originates from the Greek 
prōtotupos meaning “first example.” By this definition, anything that takes an idea out of your head 
and makes it visible to others may be considered a prototype. The important element that this 
definition is missing is the intention to test and improve the prototype over time. So our definition 
moving forward is: a manifestation of an idea into a format that communicates the idea to others or is 
tested with users, with the intention to improve that idea over time.  
 
This broad definition allows you to think about how you can prototype any kind of idea in your life. 
You might sketch a new idea for a floor plan layout before you rearrange furniture in your house. 
You can write out a recipe to test, and update ingredients depending on how the results taste. You 
might also write out your goals and dreams to communicate to others, and to remind yourself, as you 
work towards them and update them as you go. Each of these examples is the initial model of an 
idea, in a format that can be tested and improved. 
 
What is considered a prototype is a debated topic. There are two main camps: a prototype is 
anything that is testable and improvable or a prototype is specifically an interactive version of an 
idea. Both of these arguments are worthwhile. However, if you choose to see everything as a 
prototype, and use it as an opportunity to test your assumptions through any means possible, your 
product will benefit greatly from additional feedback and user input. If you prefer the more specific 
definition of prototyping, this book will still be useful. However, I ask you to keep an open mind to 
what prototyping might be, and how you might incorporate this skill into all areas of your work and 
life. 
 
Prototyping for products 
In product design, prototyping is essential to developing the best result for your customer, which 
later turns into more sales and happy, satisfied users. There are many names that prototypes have 
in our industry including proof of concept, minimum viable product (MVP), functional model, and 
manufacturing model. Although they have different names, the idea is the same: make an 
improvable version of your product, test it with the end user, and improve it.  
 
There are also many stages of business and product development that benefit from prototyping, 
such as strategy, use cases, personas, and user journeys. Each of these stages are improved by 
creating a rough idea of what it should be, testing it and getting feedback, and updating it before 
settling on a final version. 
 
 

This framework and process has been proven countless times by large, established businesses, 
designers, and successful startups. One historic example are the prolific prototypes that Charles and 
Ray Eames created for each of their designs. They would test many ways of using different 
materials, fitting to the human form, manufacturing, and finishing. They believed that anyone can 
create a dream chair in their head, but only by doing the hard work of manifesting that idea into 
prototypes and then products could they actually fulfill that dream.  
 
User-centered design 
As we move through this book, I’ll be talking a lot about your users. User-centered design "is the 
process of designing a tool from the perspective of how it will be understood and used by a human 
user… rather than requiring users to adapt their attitudes and behaviors in order to learn and use a 
system”2. The best way to create a valuable product is to have an initial understanding of who your 
user is, and to engage that potential user throughout your process to interact with your idea and 
prototypes to give feedback. 
 
What specific user or customer will buy your product? If you answered “everyone” or “me” then your 
product is not serving anyone specifically, which is a problem. When you leave this question broadly 
answered, or not answered at all, you will quickly see that users can tell that your product is not 
designed for them. Even if you are a user of your potential product, you’re not the only type of 
person who will interact with it, and other users don’t have your same mental model, or thought 
process. It’s important to get outside points of view on a project, especially when you’ve been 
working on it a long time and don’t realize your own biases anymore. 
 
Since you’re not your only user, a lot of your design decisions will actually be assumptions. An 
assumption is “a belief or feeling that something is true or that something will happen, although there 
is no proof.”3 User testing prototypes provides you the proof that either supports or invalidates your 
assumptions. When you clear up assumptions, you can have more confidence that your user will find 
their way, complete their goals, and be happy with your product. By designing for a specific user, 
and specific user pain point or problem, you are guaranteed to find a spot in the market, and an 
eager customer.  
 
Developing a culture of prototyping 
Prototyping is not just a checkbox that you complete once on the way to shipping a product to 
market. To get the most out of it, you must incorporate prototyping into every part of your process, 
and constantly be looking for feedback. Everything can be prototyped, and everything is a prototype. 
There can always be a better, improved version of what you are creating, and it takes time and 
practice to develop that urge to always be prototyping.  
 
It’s important not just to prototype, but to create a culture of constant feedback and user testing in 
your company or startup. Each person should seek feedback from their peers to improve the work 
they are doing. Every meeting can be improved by requiring a prototype as a point of discussion, to 
keep everyone on track and make it easier to communicate about the work. If this culture doesn’t 
exist in your company, start displaying these behaviors and encouraging your peers to do the same. 
When your co-workers begin seeing how much your work improves with constant user testing and 
prototyping, they’ll reach out to you to help them improve their work too. That way you can make 
prototyping a common term and an expected part of your team’s process. 

 
Summary 
Prototypes should be the cheapest way to test a specific assumption, and that means they can be 
nearly anything that takes an idea from your head and makes it visible to others. As long as you 
have the intent to improve your prototype, you can really not go wrong with what you build. To help 
you stay focused, it’s helpful to take a user-centered design approach. By keeping your ideal user in 
mind, you can shape your product and test it with feedback from real people. And finally, by 
incorporating prototypes into all parts of your design process, you can build a culture of prototyping 
at your workplace and be constantly getting feedback on your work.
