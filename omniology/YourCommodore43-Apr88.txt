To celebrate Australia's Bicentennial

Despite a  loy al and vociferous

Mirrorsoft are agents to a Communist
plot to take over your computer. The
release o f  Tetris, the ﬁrst computer
game ever to be produced in Russia

quite a stir in the media, particularly
in the USA.
At the recent launch members of
Mirrorsoft, the Russian Einbassy and
America's C B S  N e w s  m i n g l e d

The vacancy at Commodore for  a
marketing manager, arising through
the resignation of Amanda Cridge. has

School students as young as I I  are
being encouraged t o  consider the
implications of the widespread use ()I'
databases. Britis h Trades Alphabet
study cards have been distributed to
schools and colleges throughout the
United K i n g d o m  t o  in c r e a s e
awareness of the Data Protection Act
1984.
In a statement on this latest move,
Eric Howe, Data Protection Registrar,
said recently, " I t  is  important that
young people are made aware of' their
rights under the Act. It is also useful if
they a r e  familiar  w it h  t h e  legal
obligations o f  computer users. With
information technology play ing an
increasingly important r ole i n  o u r
daily lives, it is inevitable that a large
percentage of students will be working
with computers during their careers
and certainly their own personal data
will end up in many data banks."
The release of over 30,000 of the
studycards comes as a response to a
growing number  o f  enquiries f o r

Colour Matrices
The competition between colour dot
matrix printers is hotting up with the
launch o f  machines fr om Star and
Citizen.
The Star Multifont LC-10C has a
built-in Commodore interface and
allows a choice of seven colour, high
density NLQ  printing in one of eight
fonts. The paper can be sheet fed or
tractor driven by a push feed system
which means easier label and standard
form pr inting. Switc hing between
tractor and sheet feeding is facilitated
by a parking system which pulls the
tractor paper out of the platten path
but allows  for  automatic replacing
after the sheet run is completed.
The new style Star front panel
allows direct selecting of  six o f  the
special N L Q  fonts  as  well as  the
normal linefeed, page feed, hex dump,
self test and power up functions as well
as the new paper parking facility.
The Citizen HQP-40 also employs
high density NLQ facilities to support
its optional seven c olour  pr inting
capabilities. Only one font is supplied
in the standard machine but this will
be extended by the use of extra plug-in
Citizen 11(21'40 eolour printer
and teachers up and down the country.
The cards give a  little information
about the Act but their main purpose
is to instigate discussions and create a
questioning attitude towards the way
in which databases can be used and the
rights which an individual should have
to gain access t o  ﬁles held about
themselves.

The 1571 disk drive
can imitate CP/M drives
but its versatility can be
stretched even further

format disks'. This has meant using an
IBM c o m p a ti b l e  r u n n i n g  a
wordprocessor which has different
commands to the one that I normally
use. Now, with the Big Blue Reader, I
can do all my work on the C I28D and
create an MS-DOS disk using the
integral 1571 drive and my customary
wordprocessor.
The B i g  Bl u e  Reader fr o m
SOCiWAP Inc has been around for a
couple o f years but was not freely
available in Britain. This early version
had a few drawbacks with disks having
1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1
to be pre-formatted using a separate
program before the Reader was loaded
and the program was unable to operate
with CP/M program disks. The new
CP/M version corrects these failings
and adds a few extra improvements
into the bargain.
The resultant program i s  a
powerful aid to anyone who has to
cross formats, allowing transfer of ﬁles
between Commodore D OS, eight
sector or nine sector MS-DOS and
C128 CP/M diskettes in either single
or double sided formats.
Full use is made o f the Cl28's

ﬁle transfers a n d  disks ca n  b e
formatted to Commodore or MS-DOS
speciﬁcations without having to resort
to secondary programs. Add to this the
simple, user-friendly menu system and
the result is a powerful program with
many applications.
Commands are kept to just eight,
allowing any facility to be called up at
the touch o f a function key or by
highlighting one of the menu options
using the cursor keys: Load Dir, Copy,
Type, Utilities, View Dir. Time, Date
and Disk Cmds.
Load Dir
Selection of this option is met with a
secondary d i s k  t y p e  m e n u  -
Commodore, MS-DOS o r  C128
CP/M. I f  the computer ﬁnds a
correctly formatted disk in the drive
the menu can be scrolled back and
forth using the cursor keys.
This is a prepatory function which
must be called before selecting either
the Copy or Type options.
Copy
If a directory has been loaded into the
program, any number of ﬁles can be
selected for copying by using the cursor
keys to scroll up or down and the
RETURN key to  make the choice.
Selected ﬁles are indicated b y  a
reversed asterisk beside the ﬁle name
and mistakes can be corrected b y
reselecting any of these highlighted ﬁle
names.
If all the ﬁles are to be copied the
Fl key doubles as a 'select all' key and
the F3 key will cancel all selections.
Before the transfer is made, the
program asks which o f  the three
formats is to be used for the target
disk. If this means a cross over from
say, Commodore to  MS-DOS, the
option to convert from Commodore
ASCII to  standard ASCII codes is
offered.
Type
C128RE V I E W
Any ﬁle can be displayed directly to
the printer or screen but the results
cannot be guaranteed. Sequential text
ﬁles ca n  b e  displayed w i th o u t
problems in standard or Commodore
ASCII characters but program ﬁles
can disrupt th e  running o f  th e
program.
Text ﬁl e s normally contain
acceptable alphanumeric characters
but when I tried Commodore program
ﬁles the results were inﬂuenced by
some of the codes contained. Colours
changed, windows were formed and
program crashes resulted.
There are two ways around this
difﬁculty. Th e  disk contains a n
examine ﬁle utility which can load a
ﬁle for display via the C128's monitor.
There is also a badly documented User
Translation Table in the Utility option
which should strip non-printable
characters from displayed ﬁles but my
attempts to use it proved fruitless.
Utilities
There are two utility functions held on
the F7/8 key. The main one offers
three options. The ﬁrst I  have just
mentioned, th e  User Translation
Table. T h e  M S - D OS  d i ske tte
formatter is essential and it's good to
see it inside the program at last instead
of as a separate ﬁle. Unfortunately, the
newly added CP/M formatter is still a
separate program.
The ﬁnal option is a 1571 Speed-
Up with disables the write veriﬁcation
which normally takes place when
saving t o  a  Commodore diskette.
Although this gives about 30% faster
saving times and is fairly reliable, there
is the possibility of failure and it only
applies to  Commodore and C P/M
transfers.
The second utility is a standard
Commodore DOS allowing C128 disk
commands to be easily issued to the
drive.
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988

Additional Keys
Before transferring a ﬁle it may be
desirable to  check what is already
available. This could be done through
the Disk Command option b u t a
second, separate option is included
which also allows the reading o f
directories from all disk formats.
Time and date options also exist
which will label MS-DOS disks o r
simply give a  temporary screen
display.
Conclusions
As a 'one of a kind' program there is no
yardstick by which to gauge the Big
Blue Reader's performance. All that
can be said is that i t does. its job
admirably and with as little fuss as
possible. The functions are basic and I
got the feeling that the facilities have
been stretched to  eight options to
comply with the number of function
keys available.
The program is deﬁnitely for those
who have a very specialised need such
as my own o r  for those who are
currently upgrading ﬁles to a newly
acquired IBM compatible system.
Devised fo r  a  1571 drive, the
program will only run on a 128D in
Britain which limits its availability to
needy users. To those with access to a
I28D or to the very rare 1571 stand-
alone drives, this utility is an absolute
boon and, knowing the capabilities of
the excellent 1571, more conversion
programs may become available from
the States in the near future.

A
mentioned w h e n  b u y in g  c omms
equipment, be it modem, software or a
subscription is the actual change to
your telephone bill as a result of your
new found hobby. On the one hand it
would b e  u n f a ir  t o  ex pec t t h e
salesperson to give you an accurate
estimate of how much you will be using
their equipment or services, yet on the
other hand some of the average ﬁgures
1 have heard quoted t o  potential
customers are ludicrous!
There are three to four areas in
which you will have to pay out such as
purchasing equipment, cost of phone
calls, subscription to on-line services
(if applicable) and payment for value-
added services (on-line charges etc.)
Before I  describe each aspect. I
would like to point out that one of the
most c ommon tr aps  t h e  c omms
newcomer falls into is of not budgeting
for their hobby. Of course costs can be
offset over a period of time, but you'll
have t o pay up in  the end, s o be
prepared!
Purchasing Equipment
This covers the modem and software.
The ﬁrst payout c an be the mos t
crucial of them all. Purchasing a model
will affect the time spent on-line, and
the use of bad eomms software will bog
you down. There is nothing worse than
ﬂipping through dozens of' menus
while on-line and the telephone meter
!icking. As far as choosing a modem
.
you purchase o n e  o f  t h e  m o r e
expensive models! Why? Because these
C O M M U N I C A T I O N S

reporter in the world of communications has been ﬁnding out
By David Janda
provide higher baud rates such as
1200/75 and 1200/1200 full duplex
even 2400/2400 full duplex such as the
Pace Series Four 2400S (E499 + VAT).
Higher baud rates means more data
going down (and up) the phone line per
second, and this will reduce the overall
time spent on the telephone.
Corn ms software comes in many
guises. The only advice that can be
offered is to choose a package that you
feel comfortable with. You can save
money in the long run by purchasing
software that provides some sort o f
data ( o r  i n  t h e  case o f  viewdata
systems, frame) capture t o  disk o r
memory. This will enable you to read
the captured material off-line thus
saving you money.
It is  also worth noting that the
commercial services such as Micronet
and C ompunet  o f f e r  subscribers
various :packages' whic h t e n d  t o
include t h e  modem, software a n d
subscription a ll a t  a  reduced rate,
which are worth checking out.
One hidden hardware cost that
may crop up is that o f  a telephone
extension, or even a new line into your
premises. Should you really get into
comms the family may get annoyed
with all your wires trailing across the
living room ﬂoor  and y ou may  be
banished to some corner of the house.
A telephone extension may be in order,
and here again you can save money by
purchasing approved D I Y  telephone
extension k i t s  f r o m  r e p u t a b le
companies such as Dataphone Ltd for
as little as E10. BT will organise it for a
minimum o f  E28.75 +  V A T  f o r
residential customers.
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988

Should y o u  u s e  t h e  p h o n e
frequently then you may have to opt
for another line into your premises.
The initial cost will be D05 + VAT.
Then there is the cost o f  the .phone
(always buy your own - never rent one
from BT), and the quarterly rental is
A:13.95 + VAT.
Cost of Phone Calls
This is the big one! I have met so many
people, who, after some time have
taken one look at the phone bill and
have s ubs equently  p a r k e d  t h e i r
modem in the attic for good! Without
a doubt your phone bill will go up b e
prepared for it to double or even triple.
This may not be as had as it sounds. An
average quarterly phone bill of say E25
(ex. rental and VAT )  going up to t60
may seem a lot, but is E60 such a big
deal? Well, to some it is, so again it is
best t o  be prepared. The telephone
subscriber has two vital weapons of
use in this ear against the BT phone bill
a free booklet fr om BT  and phone
directory!
The cost o f  a call is measured in
metered units. One unit costs 4.4p +
VAT  totalling 5.06p -  remember this
ﬁgure, it is vital! Depending on what
time of day you call, and what distance
that call is at you will be allowed a
ﬁxed amount o f  time for  each unit.
There i s  a  s im p le  f o r m u la  t o
remem her:
Number of units x 5.06p = cost of cap
As an example. I  liv e in  north
London and wish to make a call to
Basildon, Essex at 9pm on a weekday.

The call will be cheap rate (mon-Fri
6pm-8am remember?). Next I need to
know what charge band Basildon falls
in, so looking at my A - D telephone
directory I  see that the charge band
letter is 'a'. A cheap rate call in charge
band 'a' will give me 100 seconds per
metered unit. I make and time the call
which lasts 423 seconds and divide this
by 100 which gives me 4.23. Ahal We
have come across a fraction, but all
calls are rounded up to the nearest unit
so I get a ﬁgure of 5. This is the number
of metered units used for the call.
Using the formula mentioned earlier:
5 x 5.06p = 25.3p the cost of the call
Each and every call that I make is
calculated in this way. After a while it
becomes second nature. The total cost
of the call is written down (rounded up
to the nearest penny) and at the end of
the day a total is made which 1 enter
into a book. At the end of a week the
daily totals are added up and an
appropriate number o f  telephone
stamps are purchased. When the next
BT bill arrives you simply pay at the
local Post Ofﬁce.
The calculating, and noting down
of totals is an application begging to be
computerised.

Subscriptions
Subscribing t o  services such a s
Micronet. Compunet or Microlink is
going to cost you money. The vast
majority of services have a quarterly
subscription and nearly all require you
to subscribe for a minimum o f one
year.
Value Added Services
This is another of those costs which
most often than not is not budgeted
for. Under this heading can come time
charges, c o s t o f  downloading
telesoftware, playing a n  on-line
adventure game, entering a prize draw,
or time charges for reading pages of
information. These can mount up, and
are very hard t o  keep track o f.
Compunet provide their customers
with a detailed invoice itemising every
transaction made o n  th e  system
together w i th  reference number,
description, cost, date and VAT. Hats
off to Compunet!
Prestel/Micronet o n  th e  other
hand are terrible in this department.
Bills are not itemised and there is no
way in which you can verify costs by
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988

looking a t the bill. It's a  bit like
receiving a bill in a restaurant which
has just one heading - food x pounds
please.
An example of where things can get
out of hand is when playing Shades,
Micronet's on-line adventure game.
This, l i k e  m a n y  o th e r  on-line
adventure games is very addictive, and
players spend a lot of time and money
on it. The game is time charged, yet
players can only check the total cost of
the current session on-line, and even
this does not include VAT. To make
matters worse, areas on Micronet such
as X tra the on-line magazine are time
charged for non-Micronet subscribers,
yet the time charge is included in the
current total for the on-line session
(which is subsequently taken off when
the bill is calculated). This makes a
mockery of the on-line total, and in all
the billing system employed by Prestel
is, to put it mildly, puzzeling.
By careful use of on-line systems,
and by calculating the cost of phone
calls a lot of money can be saved. It has
not been my intention to 'scare o ff
potential, or existing modem users, but
to highlight some of the cost which in
the end, you and I have to pay.

ULTIMATE
C64 R E V I E W
Are the latest cartridges on
the market the ultimate in
C64 add-ons?
By Stuart Cooke
E
had a cartridge port, it is only over the
last couple of years that the cartridge
market has been getting the attention
that it deserves. Unfortunately, for the
software indus tr y , m a n y  o f  t h e
cartridges developed were designed to
enable the user to copy commercial
programs.
As time has marched on, more and
more cartridges have been developed,
each offering more facilities than the
last. Now Datel has added two more
cartridges to the ranks of ever ready
programs in  the guise o f  the Final
Cartridge III and the Action Replay
MK IV. Both of these cartridges offer
their owner facilities for making copies
of commercial software. However,
both offer the user of these cartridges
many mor e features, making them
stand out from others in the market.

To Copy Or Not To Copy
Even though many  cartridges offer
'backup' facilities we must stress that
Your Commodore does not condone
the copying of software for purposes
other than the owners own use. We do
understand the importance of having
backups o f  much used software t o
guard against accidents. Cartridges
that offer copying facilities should be
used for just this purpose.
Making backups of programs can
also give an increase in loading time.
Using the War p 2 5  option o f  the
Action Replay IV cartridge, more of
this later, the loading time o f  my
wordprocessor was reduced fr om I
minute 45 seconds t o  just 9, yes 9,
seconds, impressive eh?
The Final Cartridge?
When the original F inal Cartridge
made its way on to the UK market it
proved t o  b e  extremely popular.
O riginally  t h e  c ar t r idge a d d e d
numerous 'utility ' functions t o  the
CM, which the computer was in need
of. D O S  func tions  w er e added
allowing the user to access a directory
listing without having t o L O AD  it
over the program in memory. Basic
programmers were given a number of
toolk it c o m m a n d s  in c lu d in g  a
renumber, while machine code users
were given access to a monitor that
wasn't resident i n  t h e  computers
memory. T h e  F inal Cartridge I I I
offers all o f  the above facilities and
much more. F or  a start the C M  is
given a new, Macintosh like, desktop.

Basic Plus
As previously mentioned, the Final
Cartridge III adds a numbr of extra
facilities to Basic, these are:
Bi-directional scrolling o f  Basic
programs:
A printer interface;
Screen dump facilities;
A disk and tape turbo:
Pull down menus;
29 new commands;
New editing commands.
The new editing commands allow
you to jump to the bottom o f  t he
screen, delete characters after the
cursor to the end of the line and freeze
output to the screen -  useful with the
LIST command.
The printer interface mentioned
above allows you to connect a nop-
Commodore printer to the C64 via a
Centronics interface.
All of the new Basic commands can
either be entered directly from the
keyboard or selected from a pull down
menu. Obviously space won't allow
me t o  detail all o f  the commands
available so I'll just mention a few:
AUTO -  gives auto line numbering
facilities;
BAR -  allows you to turn on and off
the pull down menu:
APPEND/DAPPEND -  adds t he
speciﬁed program t o  t h e o n e i n
memory from either tape of disk;
DESKTOP -  takes yo u into the
cartridges desktop:
DOS -  allows you to send commands
to the disk drive, and get directory
listings, with ease;
DUMP -  list variables used b y a
program:
FIND -  search program for speciﬁed
information;
KILL. -  disable the cartridge;
MON -  enter the cartridges montior;
RENUM -  renumber a program;
PACK/UNPACK -  compress and
uncompress the program in memory.
- allows you to use a hexadecimal
number
Freezer
Monitoring
C64 R E V I E W
As I have already mentioned the Final
Cartridge I l l  allows you t o  make
backup copies of programs, - well this
is the section of the product that does
it, however, it doesen't end there.
Once you have accessed the freezer
you can manipulate the program in a
variety of different ways. Firstly, there
is an extremely powerful printer dump
option that will send a copy of your
current screen t o  the printer. One
extremely impressive feature of this
screen dump is the fact that not only is
the backdrop sent to the printer but
sprites are also printed. This is the only
printer dump that I have come across
that does this. It is worth pointing out
that due to the complexity of some
programs you can't successfully print
out everything.
Cheats are catered f o r b y the
ability to disable sprite/sprite collision
detection a n d  sprite/background
collision detection. Wh en  playing
some games selecting these options
will allow you to avoid being killed. A
G A M E  A U T O F 1 R E  o p t i o n
transforms your normal joystick into
one with auto-ﬁre capability. When
you hold down the ﬁre button the
joystick keeps ﬁring.
When ﬁnished manipulating the
program in  memory you have the
ability to return to the program, exit to
the desktop or go into the machine
code monitor.
The machine code monitor offers all of
the commands that you would expect
to ﬁnd such as assemble, disassemble,
memory display etc. A  number o f
other useful commands have also been
added t h a t  m a k e  t h e  m o n it o r
extremely powerful. Commands exist
to edit characters and sprites. These
aren't 'real' editors but allow you to
enter a series of '*'s and '.'s in the
shape of the character or sprite that
you require. A  disk monitor allows
YOU to access and modify the internal
memory in your disk drive. As well as
being able to modify the internal, your
drives memory facilities exist to read
areas o f  the disk in the drive into
memory.
Speeded Up
I have already mentioned that the
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
20
Final Cartridge III has both a disk and
a tape turbo.
To use the tape turbo you simply
LOAD and SAVE programs with a
device number of 7 rather than missing
it out or using 1. The tape turbo is
around ten times faster.
The disk turbo is automatically
used with any disk command. The
improvement o n  loading speed i s
around 15 times. It is worth pointing
out that if a program is protected then
not all of it will be loaded at turbo
speed. Though this can be overcome
by freezing the program. In my own
tests I found that my wordprocessor
actually loaded slower when the Final
Cartridge I l l  was enabled than the
same program did when the cartridge
wasn't present -  and that program
doesn't have its own turbo.
Final Cartridge?
There can be no denying that the Final
Cartridge I I I  h as some extremely
powerful and useful facilities. My own
view is that the Basic utility commands
and screen dump facilities are excellent
but that the desktop facilities, though
extremely pretty, arc gimmicky and
anyone using the cartridge will soon
get fed u p  o f  using many o f  the
facilities offered. The idea of having a
notepad facility permanently available
was extremely appealing to me as I
could use it for writing quick memos
and t akin g  telephone messages,
however when you move from Basic to
the desktop any program in  Basic
memory is lost. In other words you
have to SAVE your programs before
accessing the desktop. rn my mind this
makes options such as the notepad and
calculator useless since you can't ﬂick
between them and your program.
So would this cartridge be my
Final one? Well to be honest it is good,
but it's not that good.
Action Replay
Reading adverts in Your Commodore it
sometimes seems t hat  the Action
Replay cartridge i s  upgraded, re-
released every month. I n  fact the
newest re-generation is only number
four and is the most comprehensive to
date.
So much i s  packed into this
cartridge that Datel has had a custom
LSI logic chip designed by Motorola
for the cartridge. As well as this there is
also 32K of ROM and 8K of RAM
inside the small red box that plugs into
the cartridge port.

Back Again
As with all o f  the previous Ac tion
Replay cartridges the emphasis on this
one is the ability to backup programs.
When saving a  bac k up y o u  a r e
presented with various options. You
can SAVE the program as one of the
following types:
Standard speed:
Turbo;
Warp 25.
Standard means that the program
uses t h e  n o r m a l dis k /c omputer
LOAD routines and will re-load at the
normal Commodore snails pace. A
turbo saved ﬁle will re-load quicker
than normal, however both o f  these
options bec ome r edundant onc e
you've used Warp 25 after all what's 6-
7 times the normal LO AD rate?
Warp 25 ﬁles are of such a format
as they can only be loaded either with
the cartridge present or from a special
loader program. A n  option exists
within the cartridge to save the loader
onto your disks.
All ﬁles saves at WARP 25 will re-
load in 6-7 seconds, or so Datel claim.
In practice loading time is  a  little
longer as you do need to LO AD and
RUN the loader program i f  the
cartridge isn't present, however this
only adds a couple of seconds onto the
loading time -  who needs a parallel
disk operating system?
If using cassette then you too have
an option regarding the speed of the
SAVE. TURBO saves your programs
in such a way that they will re-load at
between 5  and 6  times faster than
normal. SUPERTURBO saves t h e
programs so that they will re-load at 8-
10 times normal, Superturbo requires
that the deck is in good condition and
that you are using good quality tape. If
not the results can be unpredictable.
For thos e awk war d t o  c opy
programs facilities ex is t t o  enter
POKEs into the program and LO AD
parameters f r o m  a  s pec ial d is k
available from Date!.
Pretty Pictures
As well as giving excellent backup
facilities a number of graphic options
also exist. As with the Final cartridge
you can disable sprite collision
detection enabling you to 'cheat' at
some o f  those difﬁcult games. It's
important t o  note that n o t  every
program w i l l  w o r k  w i t h  s pr it e
detection disabled. Another parallel
with the Final Cartridge I I I  is  the
ability to edit sprites, however, the
C64 R E V I E W
editing facilities of the Action Replay
IV are far superior. The sprite editor is
a 'real' one with the ability to display
sprites in either normal or multicolour
mode, change the colours, alter the
sprites. invert sprites, etc. In fact as a
stand alone program the sprite editor
would be fairly useful. For a games
programmer t h i s  n o n - m e m o r y
resident sprite editor is a must as it will
allow them to stop their program at
any time, tweak the way their sprites
look and then carry on with the game.
The non-programmer can have great
fun alter ing t h e  sprites i n  t h e ir
Favourite games.
Options exist to dump screen to a
printer or save it out in such a way that
it can be re-loaded by an arts package
such as Blazing Paddles (also from
Datel), The graphic dump is not as
versatile as  the one o n  the F inal
Cartridge I I I  a n d  doesn't inc lude
sprites i n  t h e  picture. Eps on and
Commodore printers are catered for,
One 'throw away' feature of the
cartridge is  the Text Modiﬁer, this
allows you to search through memory
for a speciﬁc string and change it to
another gr eat if you want to add your
own name to the high score table of a
game before you SAVE it.
Utilities
A number  o f  useful facilities ar e
provided by the cartridge. There's a
fast formatter for disk users. A  ﬁle
copier w i l l  c opy  indiv idual ﬁles ,
including WAR P 25 ﬁles. Yo u  can
even change nor mal programs t o
Warp 25 and vice versa. The ﬁle copier
comes into it's own when you realise
that it will work with two disk drives -
no m o r e  tedious  dis k  swapping!
Should you want to copy a whole disk
then a  disk copier is  provided for
copying Unprotected disks,
More from Basic
As well as  providing the expected
cartridge orientated fac ilities  t h e
Action Replay I V cartridge, like the
Final Cartridge, adds a number of new
facilities to Basic.
Firstly a DOS is included so that
you can access the drive with ease, get
disk directories etc. Furthermore the
function keys are deﬁned so that some
commands can be entered with one
key-stroke, for example loading and
running the ﬁrst program on disk.
A n u m b e r  o f  e x t r a  b a s i c
commands are provided, not as many
as the ﬁnal cartridge but still useful.

Monitoring
An extremely powerful machine code
monitor exists within the cartridge.

it doesn't perform a reset to stop the
program currently running. U p o n

You can examine memory contents in
hex, ASCII and CBM screen codes.

and hex  exist as does the unusual
ability to perform a Basic function.
In the Ring
Both of the cartridges looked at here
offer the user essentially the same
facilities. The Final Cartridge is more
gimmicky than the Ac tion Replay
cartridge and for me has a number of
facilities t h a t  w ould s oon become
redundant.
If y o u  a r e  a  newc omer  t o

wealth of toolkit commands useful.
I f  y o u  a r e  a n  a d v a n c e d
programmer and are more interested
in programming y our  computer in
machine code, then the monitor in the
Action Replay cartridge is excellent.
Disk owners will also ﬁnd WARP 25 a
delight. D o n ' t  forget y ou can even
backup your own programs and save
them at turbo speed.
So which one would I say was the
overall winner? Well both cartridges
have their own good and bad points
and I could ﬁnd excellent use for both
of them. I could say buy both, if you
did y ou wouldn't be disappointed.
Should I have to make a decision to
purchase one then the Action Replay
IV suits my requirements as a serious

software auto-starts when loaded from
disk. Further more, many have screens
that are displayed while the program is
loading, giving information about the
author o r  pr ogr am instructions.
Unfortunately, for many people who
would like to give their own programs
this professional touch, the process of
auto-starting a  program, let alone
displaying a screen, is quite difﬁcult.
The program presented with this
article changes all of that. it allows you
to alter any Basic program (less than
39K in length) so that it will auto-start
on loading. It also allows you to design
your o w n  lo a d in g  screen, us ing
characters ac c es s ible f r o m  t h e
keyboard, that will be displayed while
the program is transferred from disk
into the computer's memory.
Protection Pius
Apart from the convenience of your
program auto-running, because the
program auto-runs you will be able to
protect your masterpiece from prying
eyes. A  simple method of protection
would b e  t o  mak e t h e  following
instruction the ﬁrst in your program:
POKE 808,251
This quite s imply  disables the
RUN/STOP and RESTO RE keys.
Further protection could be added,
such as a routine to erase the program
on a reset etc.
The A U T O - S T A R T  M A K E R
program loads the Basic program into
reserved memory. I t  then writes the
program t o  disk with the necessary
machine code, and the loading screen.
This process adds about 6  blocks

The .8,1 must not be left out or the

otherwise the computer thinks it is in

Auto-Starting a Program
A detailed breakdown of the operation
of the AUTO - START M A K E R  is
given below. Careful reading and
following of these instructions should
give success every time.
To s t a r t  t h e  AU T O - ST AR T
MAKER simply LO AD and RUN it.
There will be a short delay while it
loads t w o machine code ﬁles fr om

The M E N U  has  t h e following
options:
COMMENCE AUTO-START PRO-

Selecting this option puts you into the
screen editor. To exit the editor press
the F t key. The screen that you have
been working on will not be lost.
LOAD LOADING SCREEN -  Allows
you to LO AD  a previously designed
screen into the editor.
SAVE LOADING SCREEN -  Puts a
copy of the current editor screen onto
disk.
READ DIRECTORY -  Displays the

contents of the disk error channel on
screen.
NOTE. It is not necessary to SAVE the
loading screen with the above option.
This simply allows you t o SAVE a
copy of a screen for later re-call. The
C O M M E N C E  A U T O - S T A R T
PROCEDURE saves the editor screen
with the 'new' Basic program.
To use the program simply design,
or load a  previously saved loading
screen. F2 allows you to design your
own screen. Use the normal keyboard
characters and editing keys (cursors
etc.) to design your screen. When the
cursor comes t o the bottom o f  the
screen it will appear at the top.
The colour keys have no effect on
the display as the colour of the loading
screen is pre-determined by the colour
memory on loading.
Once your screen is designed press
1 to ﬁnish.
Next s elec t t h e  C O M M EN C E
A U T O - S T A R T  P R O C E D U R E

there is a screen in memory. I f  there
isn't you will be returned to the menu.
The next prompt asks you for the
name of the program that you wish to
convert to auto-start.
Remember, this program must be
in Basic and must be less than 39K.

C64 does just that, it clears the screen
in one go. In many cases this is•all that
you require within a program. There
are times, however, that it would be
nice to clear your screen in a different
way just to make your program look
that little bit special.
Presented here are some simple
Basic routines which will enable Basic
programmers to clear their screens in a
variety of different ways. instead of the
usual 'PRINT CLR/HOME'.
Using the ROM
Three ROM routines exist within the
C64 that enable us to play around with
the way that the screen is cleared. Two
positions the cursor, the other cleafs an
entire screen line. We will use these
routines i n  some o f  the examples
presented here. First it is important
that we shed some light on the use of
the routines.
To position the cursor you use:
POKE211,X:POKE214,Y:SYS58732
Or:
Clear With1
Basic
POKE78LY:P0KE782,X:POKE783,
0:SYS65520
Where Y is the row from 2 to 24 and X
is the column from 0 to 39.
To clear an entire screen line you use:
POKE78 LY:SYS59903
Where Y is the same as above.
The Listings
Our ﬁrst program LISTING I. is the
base for many of the other routines so
type this in and SAVE it. When you
enter the other examples you need only

If you RUN LISTING I and press
a key once the screen is full, you will
see the screen clear from to p  t o
bottom. You may not think that this is
that fancy but it does get us started.
Careful examination o f  the listing
should make it clear how the program
works.
Now let's reverse LISTING I and
make the screen clear from the bottom
of the screen to the top. easy, just type
in the new lines of LISTING 2. Just by
adding an extra variable (B) and
incrementing this by one every pass
through the loop we reverse LISTING
1. It's very simple and works a treat.
Now that we've got a couple of
simple clear-screen routines let's jazz
them Lip a bit. Insert the new lines of
LISTING 3 into LISTING land RUN
it. We now have a screen clear starting
from the bottom left and going in an
up/clown fashion in columns o f 10
characters.
On to the next routine. Add the
Lines of LISTING 4 to LISTING I and
RUN-it. The screen will now clear in
four sections all emanating from the
centre, very easy this one. Why not try
to combine the four sections together
so that they clear at the same time?
LISTING 5 gives a partial answer
to the above problem, again add the
lines to LISTING I to see the program
work. RUN this and you will see the
screen clear in four sections all at the
same time.
Still not impressed? Okay. now for
a couple of more dramatic routines.
Insert the new lines of LISTING 6 and
RUN it. After pressing a key you will
see the screen contents disappear in a
more unusual way, starting from the
top left and ending at the bottom right.
The next example given is more
suited, i n  m y  opinion, t o  games.
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988

Maybe it could be used for clearing the
screen then the game is over. Insert the
lines of LISTING 7 in LISTING land
RUN it. You will now see the contents
of the screen disappear from the four
corners o f  the screen towards the
centre. Excellent, and all :.'rom Basic.
If the routines presented here are
too slow o r  t o o  fast f o r  your
requirements, then you can alter them.
Of course i f you want to clear your
screen really quickly then you will
have to resort to machine code.
This brings u s onto our latest
example where we have a machine
code routine that will clear the screen
from right and left towards the middle.
Add the lines from LISTING 8 to
LISTING 1 and RUN it. When you
press a key you will have to wait for a
few moments for the machine code is
POKEd into memory. Not very fast
from machine code you might say, but
by POKEing memory location 49223
with a number from I to 255 you can
change the delay. I is the fastest and
255 the slowest. Even with the delay set
to I the routine isn't the fastest that
could be written, then again, i f the
screen was cleared any faster then you
wouldn't see it so what would be the
point of using a fancy routine?
Back From The Past
For more examples o f clearing the
screen with machine code. refer to a
past article i n  l o u r  Commodore
September 1986 called 'All Clear'.
Incidentally you could use the
ROM routines mentioned in the article
to position the cursor anywhere on the
screen. Just set up two variables X and
Y to the correct column and row and
produce a subroutine to call the ROM •
routine and position the cursor.

Games Update
T
have noticed that we have adapted a
new style for  reviewing games this
month. Not every game received will
now get a full review. Instead, four to
six of the more interesting games will
get reviewed in depth each month and
the rest will get lumped together in one
large summary. This style is largely
experimental so please write in and let
us know what you think.

APOLLO 18 (Electronic Arts) is an
appropriate title t o  launch the new
section. Here is your opportunity to
participate i n  a  cross section o f
missions fr om the American Space
Program. You must blast off. dock,
land on the moon, explore the moon's
surface, take off from the moon and re-
dock, walk in space and ﬁnally re-enter
the Earth's atmosphere and splash
down i f  y o u  a r e  t o  accomplish
eN erything successfully.
The game looks as if it is going to
be an enormously complicated ﬂight
simulator but in fact, it is considerably
simpler than that. Most of the actions
required of you involve no more than
pressing y o u r  ﬁr e button a t  t h e
appropriate moment. B e  war ned
though. timing is absolutely critical
(measured in thousandths of a second)
and too great an error will result in the
entire mission being aborted.
The program itself is extremely
well constructed ranging fr om the
variety and quality of the graphics to
the crackly speech which adds just the
right amount of atmosphere. All that is
really lacking is gameplay — there just
isn't enough of it and I fear that none
space fanatics will soon tire o f  the
game.
Another way  o f  exercising y our
grey cells, albeit somewhat easier than
piloting a space rocket is answering
G A ME S  R E V I E W S
questions on one o f  the numerable
quiz shows on television. Should you
not be able to get enough of your daily
lix. Domark have come to your aid
with a  c o m p u t e r  v e r s i o n  o f
BLO CKBUSTERS o n  t h e i r  T V
Gaines label.
For anyone unfamiliar with the
game, the playing area consists of a
matrix of hexagons each containing a
letter. The players are then asked a
question the answer to which begins
with the letter that is in the hexagon.
Getting the answer right changes the
hexagon to your colour and the object
of the game is to form a continuous
line o f  your colour joining opposite
sides of the grid.
The game is  designed f o r  t w o
players and this tends to cramp things
somewhat round the keyboard. The
computer decides which player has
pressed their 'buzzer' ﬁrst and invites
them t o  type i n  their  answers. I n
theory, it doesn't matter too much if
your spelling is  a  b i t  if f y  as  the
computer will 'guess' what you meant
and answer accordingly. This worked
well on some occasions and badly on
others. Surely i t  would have been
better to ask the player to shout out the
answer and use the joystick to point to
a right or wrong box accordingly.
On winning the best out of three
games, the victor is invited to take part
in a Gold Run which is more of the
same except that phrases instead o f
single w o r d s  a r e  u s e d .  T h i s
unfortunately degenerates into a test
of typing speed rather than any other
ability. T h e  graphics are adequate
complete with a digitised picture of the
host Bob Holness shaking his head
dementedly. The game itself though
does not adapt particularly well t o
computer format and I would suggest
that you stick to watching it on the
box.

Software is  a very slickly produced
shoot-ern-up but you can't help but
feel that you have seen it all before.
After the usual inane plot, it transpires
that as usual, you are the only person
in the entire galaxy who is immune to
the threats of the Galactic Imperium
and it is up to you to save the world.

The game is in two parts starting t

This game is totally ruined by one
serious fault in the game design. The
Reﬂex system o f  selecting y o u r
commands. The initial series of actions
(known as main thoughts) scroll and
ﬂash across the menu box. You have to
control a severed hand and point to the
command that you want. Timing is
important and if you misjudge things,
you are quite likely to select something
entirely different f r o m  w h a t  y o u
intended. This  is  n o  more than a
gimmick b u t  i t  renders the game
unplayable to all but the most ardent
2000 AD  fan. Certainly, traditional
adventurers will hate it.
If you have ever dreamed of being a
Yuppie, if only to be able to afford a
Porsche, T E S T  D R I V E  f r o m
Electronic Arts may prove to be the
next best thing. You are given the
chance to test drive one of ﬁve of the
world's top sports cars. Apart from the
Porsche 9 1 1 ,  t h e r e  i s  , als o a
Lamborghini Countac h, a  L o t u s
Turbo Esprit, Ferrari Testarossa and a
Corvette.
Obviously these a r e  n o t  c ar s
designed to stick to American speed
limit of 55 mph. With top speeds in
some cases o f  over 170, i t  is  only
natural that you would want to put to
the ear through its paces. The only
trouble is that the local police are none
too happy if you try to burn them off.
Some you can pull away from but
others will force you to stop and accept
a ticket like a man.
Test Drive plays reasonably well
but is lacking a certain something that
keeps it from being one o f  the top
notch racing simulations.

128 different levels coupled with 8
different bonus screens sounds like the
committed zapper's dreams come true.
HUNTER'S MOON from Thalamus is
their f o u r t h  s h o o t - e m - u p  b u t
unfortunately their weakest to date.
After inadvertently entering a
black hole, y ou ﬁnd yourself in a
strange region containing hiv e lik e
structures that regenerate almost as
quickly as you can blast them. Your
task is to locate all the Starcells on
your radar and collect them. As you
progress through the various systems,
so you can gain co-ordinates allowing
you to skip levels.
Although the game is very well put
together. I found it lacking that one
vital ingredient of all classic shoot-cm-
Lips. addictiveness.
Another shoot-en-up on offer is
M.A.C.H. from Starvision, a Danish
company. Again, the plot is somewhat
familiar. As Knight of the Galaxy, you
are trying to rescue three planets from
slavery.
The only  thing about this game
likely to tempt anyone other than total
arcade freaks is the offer of an Amiga
should you ﬁnd the secret password.
Otherwise, you've seen it all before.

CODE HUNTER from Firebird sees
you battling against a battlestar o f
unknown origin. Your only hope is to
discover t h e  necessary c odes  t o
deactivate it. T o  do this, you must
enter each o f  the computer networks
and destroy the guards there before
you can escape with the relevant bit of
code.
Each section o f  t h e  computer
consists o f  a  screen made u p  o f
squares. You move round this leaving
bombs onto which you must lure the
guards. T h e  pr oblem i s  t h a t  t h e

your path must be chosen carefully.
This is a nice little arcade/ strategy
game l e t  d o w n  s lightly  b y  p o o r

female warriors although you would
never guess it from this as they look
more like they are trying to tickle each
other with feather dusters rather than
beat each others brains out. All this
plus trying to dodge numerous arrows.
Give it a miss.
ARAC from Addictive is a much
better game. Originally released at full
price, it never received the recognition
due to it. An  arcade adventure with
some good graphics. You are Arac. a

As well as retrieving y our missing
legs and power orb, you must also cast

These will then help you in return for
their freedom. Ea c h o f  t h e  liv e

big borer can gnaw through solid walls
whereas the ray will help to confuse the

looking out for.
PUB G A M E S  fr om Alligata
another previously full price offering
that m a y  appeal. Seven different
games that you play from the comfort
of your own armchair, presumably
with a  c a n  o r  t w o  o f  a le  f o r
accompaniment.
There are a number of quirks in the
game such as players swapping sides
part way through the events but on the
whole, Pub games is a good laugh and
a worthwhile antidote t o  all those
decathlon type games.

Give your numerical

touch with this
Basic subroutine
By D.J. Tripp
C
performing repetitive sequences o f
complex mathematical calculations,
and churning out large masses o f
highly accurate answers. One thing
that mos t versions o f  t h e  Bas ic
language are very bad at is giving you
the result in a neat and readable form.
In this respect. Commodore Basic
is typical. There is no way to control
the format o f  the numbers, with the
computer making its own mind up
when to change from the "decimal"
(123.456) to the "scientiﬁc" (1.23E+4)
modes. You cannot decide how many
digits will appear after the decimal
point, or if  there are to be "trailing
zeros" to pad all numbers out to a
standard length. As a consequence, the
length o f  number strings may vary
from three (sign.one digit and the
following space) to sixteen characters
(sign,nine digits plus decimal point.
" E"  sign, two digits and following
space).
The c ommands  av ailable f o r
controlling t h e  print-out ar e als o
primitive. T h e  T A B .  S P C  a n d
"comma" functions are all cunningly
arranged to work to the start of the
number string, so unless your answers
all have the same number of  digits
ahead of the decimal point it wanders
around the column at will. This is
especially annoying when y ou ar e
printing out columns of money.
The "comma" tabulation facility is
usually of  little or  no use, especially
when there is no way to control the
column width it  provides. The C64
presets this to ten, which means that
although s hort strings d o  line u p
reasonably tidily, the longer ones spill
outside their own column and force
the next number to be displaced into
the next one, which i n  tur n often
means on t o  the next line, You are
almost certain t o  end up with your
C64 U T I L I T Y ' S
COM
Tabulate
numbers scattered at random across
the page, w ith the headings either
sitting over the spaces between the
numbers or  over the wrong column
altogether!
In m a n y  cases. u s e  o f  t h e
"Rounding function", or:
FNR(X)=INT(1000*X+.5)/1000
to give its "three decimal places" form,
together with the T AB function, will
give a reasonably neat layout to be put
to the screen. However, this function
does not stop the numbers switching
from normal t o  scientiﬁc notation,
and the TAB,SPC and "comma" still
line up on the ﬁrst character.
In addition, there are two other
nasties lur k ing i n  the background
which this method is powerless to deal
with:
•  Your printer almos t certainly
does not recognise the TAB function,
and the printout will wander all over
the place. All the effort you have put in
to g e t  t h e  screen lay out nic ely
organised is therefore wasted.
•  There a r e  c er tain " m a g i c "
numbers which do not print out as you
would expect them to, and instead of
getting t h e  expected n u mb e r  o f
decimal places printout, you get the
full length string. If you are trying to ﬁt
numbers into narrow columns, these
numbers will spill out and upset the
rest of the line_
If you have not met these "magic
numbers" b e f o r e ,  t r y  e n t e r in g
"PRINT 5.5(7" in immediate mode or
as a line in a program, and see what
happens. There are quite a lot of these
numbers, and i f  the result o f  any
calculation, including the "Rounding
Function", h it s  t hem,  t his  effec t

included f o r  y our  convenience. I t
allows you to deﬁne a new format via
EMS. and a  new input number or
heading, and make just one call to this
routine to print out the new item in the
new format, rather than calling parts
2) and 3) separately.
FORMAT STRINGFIVIS
This string is most useful if you want to
change all or a k w  of the formatting
parameters from the default or current
values in one go.
FM$ is made up as follows:
EMS=" <CO > < TY> < P L >  < J U >
<SI >"
where:
<CO > =  (CO)Iumn width, or ﬁeld
width
TY > ( T Y ) p e  o f  numer ic al
notation
< PL > =  t h e  number  o f  decimal
(PL)aces to be displayed
<J U > =  (.11.1)stiﬁcation o f  item in
the column
<SI > =  (SI)ze, o r  the number of
decimal places expected ahead of the
decimal point. This is only used with
the "Rounded" notation, allowing
you to position the decimal point so
that there is sufﬁcient room to the left
of i t  t o  accommodate the largest
number you expect in your answers. If
you set St too small, you may ﬁnd the
bigger numbers are pushed to the right
to get them in. and your neat line of
decimal points is spoiled!
The types available are:-

R -  Th e  normal o r  "decimal"
notation,(R)ounded up to (PL) places
of decimals. (Note the rounding up is
done on the ABSOLUTE value of the
number, thus -1.15 will be rounded to
-1,2 to one place of decimals, rather
than 1.1). Numbers with less than PL
decimal places after the decimal point
will be padded with trailing zeros.
M -  (M)oney format. As "R"ounded,
except that the numbers arc broken up
bY the conventional commas at the
thousand. million and one thousand
million points.
S -(S)cientiﬁc notation, again with the
values rounded up as described for
"R" notation.
E -  (E)ngineering notation. This is
similar t o  the scientiﬁc notation.
except that the powers of ten change in
steps of three. Probably most used by
electronics engineers.
U - (or any other letter except. R.S.M
or E) -  (U)nchanged prints numbers
just as the computer sends them. Most
useful i f you have chosen the " R "
format and all your printouts are
0.000. Change the format to "U" and
it will let you see if it is your program
that is at fault, or if you have chosen an
inappropriate format for the results!
The output may be JUstiﬁed:
L -  to the (L)eft of each column
R - to the (R)ight of each column
C - (or any other letter except L or R)-
(C)entred, with the decimal points
aligned down the column.
"Read FM$". routine 61000, reads
FMS item by item from the left.-If the
ﬁrst item is a NUMBER. this will be
read as (CO)Iumn width. The ﬁrst
LETTER is taken as (TY)pe, and so
on,
Therefore, i f you want to change
the number o f  decimal (PL)aces
displayed, you MUST precede it with
the (TY)pe you are using, as otherwise
"Read EMS" sees the number as
(CO)Iumn width. Similarly, i f  you
want to  change the (JU)stiﬁcation,
you must precede it with the current
(TY)pe letter, or your JU letter will be
taken as the (TY)pe, with (SI)ze (if you
have included it) read as PL.
Within these rules, any item may
be omitted, in which case the variable
it represents will retain its current
value. Once you have set up all the
format values (by GOSUB 600(X)), youTabulate
C64 U T I L I T Y ' S
only need to put in the things you want
to change.
Examples of valid forms of FM$ are:

EMS="RC4" (CO)Iumn width and
(PL)aces unchanged, "R"ounded
notation selected w i th  a n  offset
expecting numbers with a (SI)ze of 4
characters ahead of the decimal point.
Formatting with Tabulate -
Demo
The power of FM$ formatting comes
into its own when you want to make up
complex tables with many changes of
format. In this case, you can load all
the EMS values into a string array
from easy-to-ﬁnd DATA statements,
and call them u p  either from a
"FOR N E X T "  loop which also
calls your results in order, or by the
array number in the sequence you
require them.
In some cases i t will be found
quicker to change a single formatting
parameter directly. For example, i f
you only want to change the column
width from its last value to, say, 20 you
would just put "CC, 2 0 " before the
next number.
I have included a  short(ish)
program, called by the inspired name
of "DEMO", which should make use
of both methods o f control clearer.
This l i t t l e  p ro g ra m shows i n
particular how FM$  and the four
routines of TABULATE can be used
to best advantage.
The program itself does not do
anything very clever, and most of it
consists of table formatting (I did say
at the start that you may stilt have a lot
of work to do!). But you will see how
all the controls for the printout can be
contained in DATA statements, and
how the "read EMS" routine may be
used to extract information from the
data t o  control, fo r example. the
lengths of the dividing lines separating
the parts of the header.
DEMO prints the DATA lines out
for you after each run, so you can
easily make changes and re-run the
program to see the effect (As written,
some of the choices made initially are
not too clever - see how quickly you
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
12
can rectify this, and then think back as
to how you would have done it before
the advent of TABULATE!).
Getting it in
TABULATE is written without using
any o f  those horrid "Commodore
Graphics" symbols, so entering i t
should present f e w  problems.
However, there are some deeply nested
functions, s o  count th e  brackets
carefully! Yo u  may "crunch" the
program if you want to by leaving out
all the REM and spacing ("59990 :")
lines. The program is numbered to let
you d o  this without the danger of
GOTO'ing a non-existent line.
Type in the program, and save it to
disk or tape.
TABULATE i s intended to  be
tacked on to  the end o f your own
program, a n d  i s  n u mb e re d
accordingly. If you own an extended
Basic or utility cartridge that gives you
the MERGE or APPEND ability, then
life is easy for you, and you can add it
to existing programs using these
means. If not, you will have to type
TABULATE on to the end of existing
programs each time.
For n e w  p r o g r a m s , l o a d
TABULATE ﬁrst, and then compose
your program on top of it.
If the line numbers clash wit
existing lines in your own program
then r e n u m b e r  T A B U L A T
accordingly but make sure you alter al
the GOTO's and GOSUBS properly i
you do.
You must also check that th
variables used by TABULATE&) no
clash with any in your own program
Tabulate uses:
CO,DD,DV,DL,EMS,JLLPES
PL,PZ,PXS,SI,SPS,TY,VE.
If you are in the habit of compilin
your Basic programs, especially wit
PETSPEED, you may ﬁnd that tw
lettered variable names such as the
cause strange things to happen. If till
occurs, you will have to rename dm
as CI,D1 etc. I make rio excuse for n
doing this in the ﬁrst place - most
the names were chosen either becau
they formed an easily remember
mnemonic (CO,TY etc) or were a b
strange and unlikely to be used
anyone else (DD,PZ etc).

this is the way golf is really played by millions on the world's
crazy golf courses. Electronic Art's Mini-Putt contains four
of the craziest courses to test your skill, courage and mental
ability.
The game was written by Electronic Arts by Accolade
who were the team behind games like I lardball, Killed Until
Dead and Comics and other recent EA games - Test Drive
and Apollo 18. All these games have one thing in common as
they combine addictive gameplay with great graphics,
The Mini-Putt screen is divided into four sections. Two
thirds of the screen shows a top down view of the hole being
played including the ball and a cross that is positioned using
the joystick to decide the direction of the shot. Below that is
a picture of your mini-golfer with a speed and accuracy
gauge, a map of the entire hole (since most holes are bigger
than a single screen) and a record of shots taken and the par
for the hole.
To take a shot you must line up the cross in the direction
you wish the ball to travel in (you can move onto the other
screens that make up the hole by moving the cursor off the
side of the screen) which also changes the distance by the
golfer. Pressing the ﬁre button starts a bar moving up a
gauge so that the release o f  the button determines the
strength of the shot and also starts a bar moving over the
accuracy gauge. This has a single line that you must stop the
bar on by pressing the button since any error will mean you
hit the ball off target. When you release the button the ball
hopefully heads towards the hole.
That's the theory which should work everytime on a ﬂat
C64 R E V I E W
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
33
green. Unfortunately, this a crazy golf and theory takes a
back seat as the courses are far from ﬂat and contain a
variety of obstacles put in your way from variable slopes to
walls, bridges, an aeroplane, elephant, castle and even the
Taj Mahal!
The four courses are given the misleading names of
Deluxe, Classic, Traditional and Challenging which you'll
soon r ename t o  standard, c urious , tr aditional a n d
impossible. Each course consists of nine holes and can be
played b y  u p  t o  f o u r  players w h o  tak e their  shots
alternatively with the result of the preceding hole deciding
the playing order. The holes vary from par one to three
which often means that the player going ﬁrst is used by the
others as a guinea pig.
The Deluxe course is the easiest with the holes consisting
of walled paths and a network of slopes that are marked by
coloured areas with arrows showing the direction of the
slope. This may look simple but it's not easy to pick a shot
through a course littered with slopes. At the end of each hole
the scores are displayed for each hole as well as the running
totals and the par for the course so far.
The classic course is undoubtedly the best as it contains
some o f  the hardest holes in  Mini-Putt. H ole tw o is
particularly difﬁcult thanks to an elephant that's sitting
right in the middle of  the course. T o complete the hole
within the par three you have to time your ﬁrst shot to avoid
the elephant's trunk that will hit you into an impossible
position, over a narrow bridge that spans a river, navigate
through a series of slopes that will steer you back over the
river, this time via a conveniently positioned boat, through a
gap in a wall past the swishing elephants tale and into the
hole!
The reward for completing the hole is a chance to fail on
a traditional windmill before trying to get your ball past a
revolving aeroplane propeller and then into a cannon that
ﬁres you over the walls that totally surround the hole, This
course also features walls with small holes in them such as
the ones in the castle wall that you must hit the ball in only to
ﬁnd that it doesn't re-appear in the obvious direction but in
the worst •possible place. There's one hole where the exit
varies depending on how many players have passed through
and anyone who tries to copy the success of a player before
them will ﬁnd themselves going backwards.
The traditional and challenge courses are back to the
simple walls, water and slopes of the ﬁrst course but these
are arranged in such a way that you have to be exact with
your shot's strength and direction and take your life in your
hands just to break even. This is Mini-Putt at it's toughest as
the slightest mistake could cost three shots. The on screen
golfer will mimic your actions and will jump with joy if you
sink a  par  o r  even a  birdie o r  hole in  one which is
accompanied with a fanfare to impress the neighbours but
he will stand sullenly over the hole if you go over par and
break his club over his knee in disgust if the shot ends up in
water.
Finally, two peices of advice. The ﬁrst is printed on the
packaging and advises you to remove any breakable objects
so they don't get hurled across the room, and secondly if
your opponent 10 putts a par three - don't laugh too loudly as
it could happen to you on the very next hole.
A superb new twist to the Leader Board style of hit and
hope golf game.

seasons, winds and dragons and packed with the mystery of
the Orient. I t  is also the latest in the Colossus series o f
strategy games from CDS. I f  you've ever seen the Chinese
playing Mali Jong at incredible speeds you may have noticed
a blur  o f  bamboo and ivory tiles covered in mysterious
symbols. These symbols have now been transferred into C64
pixels that accurately display the suits and majors of Mah
Jon g.
Mah Jong is played with a set o f  144 tiles that are
shufﬂed (or washed or twittered) and built into a wall and
then dealt to the four players who are known as East, West,
North and South. The object of the game is to build up a
complete hand of 14 tiles that Consist of pungs (3 identical
tiles), Kongs (4 identical tiles) and chows (a run of three tiles
of the same suit) and a pair. You begin the game with 13 tiles
and take it in turns to take a piece from the wall and then
discard one. You can jump a turn by claiming a discarded
piece for a pung or a kong but you can only claim a chow
from a person playing before you.
This s imple game system has  prompted many  t o
compare Mah Jong to the card game rummy but a few hands
of Mah Jong will convince you that this offers a lot more.
Each of the three Mah Jong suits (the bamboos, circles and
characters) contains four tiles that range from one to nine so
there can be a scramble if more than one player is going for
the same pung. The two to nine of each suit are considered
minor tiles and a pung of them is only worth two points
whereas a pung in the major ones or nines is worth four
points. The Mall Jong set also contains winds and dragons
that are not only worth four points per pung but a pung of
dragons or your own wind will double your score. There are
also four ﬂowers and seasons that correspond to the four
players and will score a double if you get your own and three
doubles if you get all four seasons or ﬂowers.
Two points for a pung and even with 20 points for going
Mali Jong may not sound a lot, but through skillful play and
the collection of pieces that give you doubles you can build a
score worth hundreds or even thousands in a single hand! To
add to the drama the player who is currently East pays and
collects double his score when the totals are compared at the
end of a hand.
To amass a really big score you should go for one of the
special hands that can earn you 1000 points in a single hand.
These hands have amazing names to match their value and
the difﬁculty to create them, but should you collect buried
treasure, four blessings hovering over the door,- imperial
jade or a gates of heaven you should enjoy it as it may be a
long time before you see another one.
Colossus Mall Jong provides you with three computer
opponents that can play at nine different skill levels and the
inclusion of features such as 3D displays of the tiles, a grid in
the centre of the screen that neatly displays the discarded
tiles and the ability to turn on and off game components
such as special hands and hidden discards to make the game
as difﬁcult or easy as you want.
A full game of Mah Jong consists of four rounds which
contain as many games as necessary for each player to have a
turn as East. This can often be more than four as East
remains East if he goes Mah Jong. On the computer as in the
real game this can take several hours but you can shorten
this by only playing one or two complete rounds.
1 have played Mah Jong for over ten years and have often
wondered if it could or would be computerised and whether
such a  version would accurately display the pieces and
include the special hands. Now CDS has done all that and

Basic
efore we can indulge ourselves in
B
an artiﬁcialls intelligent program, we
still have to tackle arrays and data —
probably the most avoided subjects in
Basic programming.
I' ye already shown that a variable
is simply a storage box for numbers, or
for groups of letters and/or numbers.
known as strings. These work well in
most cases but what happens when
you have a list o f  names that needs
sorting out into alphabetical order?
Normally. you'd make a list of the
names and then create a second list
pulling o u t  t h e  n a m e s  i n t o
alphabetical order, The computer can
behave in a similar fashion but ﬁrst it
needs a list to work from.
When we make a list, the computer
is notiﬁed by the word D A T A :
10 D AT A PET E,  J EF F .  J O H N .
FRED. FRAN, ALEX. AL AN
The computer n o w  k nows  the-
names but needs to store them in some
sort of numbered list so that it can
juggle them around. For this we use
the array.
An array is a series o f  variables
haying the name but with a qualifying
number in brackets, for example:
A(255), A S ( 6 ) ,  N A M E S ( I ) ,
NUMBER(22)
A small array, one using values
from (0) to (9). can be created simply
by using them in a program. A  line
Slating something lik e  XC ( 2) =2 I
automatically creates the X array with
ten elements numbered from zero to
nine inclusive.
Large a r r a y s  h a v e  t o  b e
DIMensioned. I n  other  words, the
computer has to be informed of  the
maximum number of elements which
will be used. F o r  example. D I M
AS(32) will create a string of arrays
with 33 elements; remember there is
also A$( 0) .  T h e  la r g e s t ,  o n e
dimensional array has 256 elements
and would be set up by something like
this:
B A S I C  T U T O R I A L
Basic can benight or bemuse, but it can also be fun

DIM NAMES(255).

can set up several variables instead of
interminable equivalance statements.
that is  NAS(  1)=-"PETE": NAS(2)=
—
we c an s et u p  t h e  variables b y
READing the data as follows:
20 F O R A = I T 0 7 : R E A D
(A):NEXT
N AS
This replaces t h e  long winded
alternative which would take up an
awful l o t  o f  m e m o r y  w i t h  a
dimensioned array o f  256 elements,
not to mention the boredom of typing
it all in!
The purpose of this exercise is to
show how the sort interacts with the
array system so we need to print out
the names in their original order as the
array is set up:
20 F O R A =I T 0 7 : R E A D  N AS( A) :
PRINT NAS(A)"".:NEXT:PRINT
Run the program and you'll see a
row o f  p r i n t e d  n a m e s  w h i c h
corresponds exactly w ith the order
given in line 10.
Forttinately  s t r in g s  c a n  b e
compared t o  each other  using the
greater than and less than symbols.
Even names whic h ar e s imilar i n
spelling such as FRED and FRAN can
be sorted in this way. F RAN will be
treated as having a value which is less
than that o f  FRED. Even a pair of
names  l i k e  G E O R G E  a n d
GEORGINA can be separated into
alphabetical order using one of these
symbols.
In o u r  program w e  w a n t  t o
compare two names and then swap
their places in the array if the second
name should precede the ﬁrst one in
alphabetical order. Using the ﬁrst two

statement such as:
IF NAS( >NAS( .2)  THEN._
would be true and whatever followed
the then statement would be executed.
The statement w o u ld  close b y
exchanging the contents o f  NAS( )
with the contents of NAS(2). If we just
said NAS( ) = N AS(2) we would change
PETE t o  J E F F  h u t  b o t h  array'
variables would then be J EFF and
PETE would he lost. We need to move
PETE o u t  o f  h is  v ariable i n t o
temporary storage. copy NAS(2) into
NAS( I)  and then bring PETE back out
as NAS(2). You may have noticed that
NAS(0) has not been used yet so here is
an ideal temporary home for PETE:
IF NAS(2) N A S (  1) THEN NAS(0)=
NASt I N A S (  )=NAS(2):NAS(2
NAS(0)
This would be quite sufﬁcient hut
PETE now needs to be compared to all
other names before he ﬁnds his place.
The use of variables gives us a new use
for a loop:
30 FOR B=2T07
40 I F  NAS( B- I) >NAS( B)  T H E N
NAS(0)=NAS( B):NAS( B)= NAS( B-I)
:NARB- I )=NAS(0)
50 NEXT B
60 F O RC= I T07:PRINTNAS(C)"
:NEXT:PRINT
Running the program will compare
PETE to all of the names in the list.
Now we have to compare all the
names by introducing a new loop using
variable 13:_
30 FORA= I106:FORB=2T07
70 NEXT A
Now the program is complete, a
careful study of the screen print out of'
each series of exchanges will show how
the sort program works. Remember
that the name will only move if  the
word that follows it has a higher value_

Out of Tune
Don Benham of Warwick has written
to say that he's having problems with
the Piano Keyboard program on page
147 o f  the User Manual whic h is
supplied with the CM. He writes:
When I  r u n  this  program I  g e t
ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR IN 310
and CannOf seem to ﬁnd what this error
is. Also. when _following the program
through. I cannot we how it ever gets to
line 800..
Taking your ﬁnal quandrv ﬁrst,
you're quite right in thinking that lines
800 onwards are redundant. Whether
it ever had any part in a longer version
of t h i s  p r o g r a m o r  n o t ,  o n l y
Commodore can say'.
I'm afraid that the main problem
you have is one of your own making
because t h e  program almos t r uns
correctly as printed in the manual. I
say 'almost' because the programmer
seems to have forgotten to switch the
volume on! Add the following line to
correct this omission:
275 POKE S+24,I5
Now, back to your problem and
how to track down faults. No matter

how carefully you type in a program,
faults seem to creep in. With an illegal
quantity error this means that a value
is being assigned to a variable which is
too high for  the purpose for  which
you're using it. T he offending line
looks like this:
310 F R =F ( K( ASC ( AS) ) ) / M : T =V
*7:CR=S+T+4:IF FR=Z THEN 500
With s o many variables around
how do you ﬁnd the troublesome one?
The answer is t o  use the STOP
command. Place it after each term in
turn until the error message appears.
Then y ou'll k now which formula is
faulty', but y ou don't k now which
variable. Suppose it turns out to be the
ﬁrst one:
FR=F(K(ASC(AS)))/M
It i s  unlik ely  that ASC(AS) is
wrong because it evaluates a keypress
which c ouldn't possibly b e  greater
than 255. Similarly if the value it gives
is o u t  o f  the range given i n  t h e
program's D I M  commands a  B A D
SUBSCRIPT error would result. This
rule also means that FOC(ASCS( AS)))
is not wrong, otherwise you'd get the
same subscript error.
The only one left is M  so check
VoLIR COMMODORE april 1988
38
back elsewhere in the program to see if
any of those statements using M could
be wrong.
If this part o f  the line is the one
causing the problem, similar detective
work will reveal your error.
Of all the complaints about faulty
listings in Your Commodore. 99(); can
be traced back to ty ping errors which
the errant typists refuse to accept is
their fault. Alway s  check, double
check and, i f  necessary check again.
We'll be looking at debugging in later
editions of Bothersome Basic but it all
boils down to logic in the end.

their pearl of  wisdom is this month.

Compunei database, Pr es tel a n d

modem mos t people use software
provided b y  o n e  o f  the services
mentioned, never dreaming that they
could write their own software which
would make the modem far  easier
to use.
This article will describe how you
can make the modem work other than
under Comp:1nel viewdata, or teletype
software. The modem can only handle
1200 baud reception but can transmit at
75 baud, or 1200 baud. This means
that i t  c a n  receive ar ound 1 2 0
characters per second, and transmit
at either 120 characters per second or
at 75.
Due to limitations of the hardware,
when 1200 baud is  being used for
transmission, no reception can occur.
This is why those of vou who have used
half-duplex Compunet access numbers
will have seen the arrow showing the
direction the data is travelling. Half-
duplex only lets information go one
way, whereas full-duplex lets data go in
both directions at the same time i f
required. Full-duplex i s  us ed f o r

necessary know-how and technical
information, much o f  which will be
covered in this article.

Auto-dialling
The auto-dialling features o f  the
modem a re  fairly powerful. Th e
program at the rear of the magazine
will automatically dial a number, or
get a name from the DATA statements,
and then engage in user to user chat.
The Ft and F3 keys are used to
swap between who is sending and who
is receiving, and the F7 key will drop
the line. Note that i f only one end
presses F7 , the line will still be
connected for the other person, unless
he keys F7.

disabled, so do not press it when using
this program, o r  the modem will
remain on line. To stop this, use the
modem RESET command:

duel for a foxhole and cover just minutes before a napalm air
raid.
The three sections are loaded in separately from tape and
you must survive one to start the next. The game begins as
you and your patrol of ﬁve enter a Vietnamese jungle.
The jungle forms a sideways scrolling maze that patrol
must enter to ﬁnd a pack of explosives that have been left by
a previous patrol. Although there are live in the patrol you
can only control one at a time but can swap freely between
them by selecting them from a menu accessed by pressing a
function key. Each man begins the game with a  full
complement of machine gun bullets ad a bagful of grenades.
As they are shot at and blown up they will suffer hits and if
they get four hits then they're reported as being killed in
action.
Deep in the jungle you'll ﬁnd some explosives that you
will need later and you may even ﬁnd some medical supplies
to heal hits and ammunition and grenades on the corpses
you create. When you ﬁnd a bridge you must be quick to get
across it, set explosives and destroy it before a large enemy
patrol crosses and wipes you out. Then it's on into the jungle
again as you search for a village. Now you must be careful
not t o  shoot innocent villagers which will damage your
morale and could end your game_ In the village you must
search the huts for a torch, map and trapdoor that leads and
equips you for part two.
In part two you are on your own as you explore a tunnel
network that is mapped out on the right hand side of the
screen. The other half of the screen shows your view and you
should stay alert ready for enemy soldiers and particularly
those that swim under the surface of the water that half ﬁlls
the complex and leap up to knife you. If you're quick enough
you can shoot them by aiming a cursor and ﬁring.
Apart from death lurking around every corner you will
C64 H E V I E W
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
41
also ﬁnd rooms to search that include useful objects such as
red cross boxes, ﬂares and a compass that are protected bN
booby trapped boxes. When and if you emerge from the
tunnel you ﬁnd yourself in a foxhole but your plans to rest
until morning are thwarted by an enemy attack. You do
have a machine gun but will need all your ﬂares to light up
the enemy or you'll be reduced to lucky shots in the dark.
As morning dawns and part three loads you see Sergeant
Elias, who led your patrol, gunned down in a hail of enem
ﬁre and discovcer that Sergeant Barnes is  indirectl
responsible for his death by not helping him. What's left ot
your innocence quickly departs but before you can act a
crackle on the radio warns o f  a napalm raid in just two
minutes. The compass that you collected in the tunnel will
guide v ou north and to safety but you'll have to avoid
snipers, traps and even hidden mines. If you succeed you
come face to face with Sergeant Barnes. He is in a foxhole
armed with a machine gun and grenades and he's trying to
kill y ou — you must avoid his ﬁre and score ﬁve direct
grenade hits to kill him and claim the foxhole before the air
raid strikes.
Each stage of this combat game will demand your skill
and reactions are at their best otherwise you'll end up a
statistic instead of a high score.

educational programs about recently
and so it was a nice surprise to receive a
parcel o f  four disks from Perfect
Fourth Software. These were the
component parts o f  a  package
designed to help students of music to
pass th e  a u ra l  p a r t  o f  th e i r
examinations. Hence th e  ti tl e  o f
"Aural".
Each package consisted o f  a
cassette or disk, an instruction book, a
booklet about the Associated Board of
the Royal Schools o f  M u s i c
Examinations and a music student's
practice diary. There a re  f o u r
packages: the ﬁrst one dealing with
Grades I and 2. Grade 1 consists of six
sections which are:
Scale lesson — t his  i s  a n
introductory lesson to remind the user
how the major chord sounds. The
chord is played and the tonic so l
name and the number of the note in
relation to the key note are shown
simultaneously.
Sing a note — in this section the user
practises singing single notes in tune.
E D U C A T I O N
Teacher's
Pet
For the musically minded take a look at the new
package speciﬁcally created for music students
By Margaret Webb
Name a note — this helps the user
practise recognising a played note. A
key chord .is played ﬁrst, and then the
key note followed by the test note. The
user has to say which note the test note
was.
Clap a Rhythm — self-explanatory!
Grade 2  uses the same approach
hut is a little more advanced. In section
2, three notes have to  be sung. In
section 3 you also have to name a note
but this time with a quicker response.
Whether you choose to do section 4 or
5 depends o n  your singing voice;
section 4 is low pitch while section 5 is
high. In this test you are given a key
note and asked to  sing the second,
third, fourth or ﬁfth notes of the scale.
Section 6 is again clapping a rhythm.
but as expected a little more advanced
than Grade
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
45
Grade 3 has the same components
as the ﬁrst package. The program
contains scale singing similar i n
approach to its equivalent in Grade 2.
The additional areas covered include
interval singing in which two notes are
played and the user is asked to sing
either the upper or lower of the notes.
In melody singing a  key chord is
played followed by a four note melody.
The user has to sing the melody aloud
getting the rhythm and notes correct.
The Grade 4 package follows very
much the same pattern as Grade 3.
High or low interval singing is similar
to Grade 3 except that you are now
asked to  name the interval. With
melody singing the length o f  the
melody is extended to live notes.
Grade 5  sta rts w i t h  scale
recognition. The computer plays as a
key chord and key note and tells the
user the name of the key (C, For G)and
then plays another note. The user has
to identify the scale. The other sections
are very much as for the other levels.
All grades have a further option for
practising beating time.

Overall, these packages did not
measure u p  t o  expectation. T h e
programming didn't really use the full
capabilities of the computer. Knowing
what games writers can get out of the
64. for example, I thought the sounds
used were 1,•ery primitive. The manual
suggests connection of the computer to
a Hi-Fi system - I'm not sure why. The
use o f  graphics. additionally, was
limited t o  the normal character set
with bland coloured screens. Although
the content is aimed at aural and vocal
skills, m o r e  attention t o  us e o f
graphics and presentation would have
added to the appeal. Due to the nature
of the subject. much must be left to the
honesty of the user. The package does
little, however, to encourage the user
to practise what is probably one of the
most d i f ﬁc u l t  p a r t s  o f  t h e
examinations. The dull presentation
could, indeed, hav e t h e  oppos ite
effects.
I asked a friend who has musical
qualiﬁcations to look at the programs.
His comments after testing them all
were not favourable. H e  said that
either the standards required for the

grades had been considerably lowered
over the years or the programs were

level. His other comment was that any

The Works
A simple description of how to use the

is needed to understand the program
operation fully. 1 have therefore kept
the program explanation extremely
simple. Should you be interested in
ﬁnding out more about y our drive
then try reading 'The Anatomy of the
1541 disk drive'.
BSW UK
In order to give the user access to a
pound sign the program BSW U K
simply alters the very last character in

the GEOS character set to the required
sign. In order to alter your character
set simply LO AD  the program given
here, put your GEOS disk in the drive
and RUN the program. The program
will do the rest and tell you of any
errors along t h e  way . Wh e n  t h e

Guild of Thieves games that have come to be much revered
by adventure gainers, largely because of their presentation
and performance on I6-bit machines such as the Amiga and.
wossname... the Atari ST.
Like infocom, a company that MS takes after in many
ways, this game is tops on packaging. Besides two disks, it
comes c omplete w i t h  s o m e  c ur ious  wos s na mes...
documents. Besides a quick guide to some of the important
commands, a copy of the 16-page Independent Guardian, a
spoof newspaper and a Department of Guardians Internal
Memo.
In the middle of all this verbiage. the keywod 'wossname'
looms large (that's enough about wossname — ED). This
ambiguous word covers a lot of what you might want to
know about the game, but as far as your intrepid reviewer
can make out, and mar k  y ou I  really don't see the
signiﬁcance o f  the cheese sandwiches, the game has
something to do with a lost bracelet.
The bracelet in question, it seems, is the much-coveted
Bracelet o f  Turani, a  bauble useful t o  the people o f
Aquitania. insofar as it  is  capable o f  increasing their
previously meagre store of luck. Turani the magician, before
departing this mortal coil, left the bracelet in the not-so-
reliable hands o f  the treacherous Green Witches, and
appointed a bunch of characters with godlike powers, who
also happened to be grimy, inarticulate and lovers of cheese
sandwiches to administer the supply of luck to the people of
Aquitania.
Sadly, however, a n  anti-bracelet s pell has  been
concocted by one of the witches, and an uncertain number of
charms (for it is a charm bracelet) hanging from the bracelet
have gone missing. Without the charms the device will not
function. Tile role of the poor unsuspecting mortal who
picks up the job of ﬁnding all the bits is to roll back the
power of the witches and restore luck to the kingdom.
Sounds like a hideously dull swords-and-magic plot,
doesn't it? In fact Jinxter doesn't quite work that way. At the
start of the game you ﬁnd yourself on the way home on a
crowded and smelly bus. The social realism lasts quite a long
time too. By my  21 2th move I  s till hadn't encountered
anything more magic than a few rather vidid hallucinations
- I've encountered worse after a few jars of Special Brew,
The fact is  that this  game really rather resembles

Hitchiker's Guide to The Galaxy — the humour is distinctly
Adamsesque w it h a  dash o f  Monty  Python. A  little
derivative, but fun in places. My  favourite ﬁctional beast,
the dog who swallows microscopic space ﬂeets, even gets a
part.
You can get a long way into J inxter before encountering
any real problems. This makes the game very good as a soft
introduction t o  adventure games for  newcomers to the
genre. An excellent idea of Magnetic Scrolls is to Provide a
hint list in code in the documentation. There are four or ﬁve
hints provided f o r  each puzzle, in  increasing order of
explicitness, To use the facility, you simply have to type a list
of double-letter combinations into the computer, and you
are told what to do. Unfortunately, for those who don't
want to be told, the title of each problem forms a hint in
itself.
Which
is wher e any  quibbles  I  hav e c ome in .
Experienced adventurers may ﬁnd this game a little slow to
get off the ground, besides being a bit of a give-away in
places. For a start it accesses tile disk a lot — if you're using a
1541 that gives you a lot of coffee breaks. And when I say a
lot, I mean a lot — the damn program needs a disk read just to
give you an inventory list or do a bit of parsing. Doubtless
this was a great idea when implemented on a 16-bitter, but it
doesn't cut the mustard on a CM. At least you can turn the
graphics off — they're pretty but uninformative.
It's also a bit pompous in places — I have little patience
with games that have you continually UNLOCK ing things,
then( awn!) OPENing things. then EXAMINEing things to
see what's inside, It doesn't give much of a puzzle, and it's
quite reasonable, as  some games do. t o  assume that
UNLOCK means OPEN as well, and some of them even
throw in a description of the contents as well. Not Jin.xter —
as if there wasn't enough of all this unlocking etc, the most
unimportant of doors in this game can blow shut all by itself,
requiring you to, of course, OPEN it again (yawn city!).
Still, the parser's pretty good. the game picks up later,
and the packaging and documentation arc great. Tile worst
problem is that slow disk interactiveness. For that, I've
lopped a few ponts off my rating.

Border Zone
ashington a n d  Moscow are the capitals o f  the
W
superpowers but the Cold War is fought in Eastern Block
countries lik e Frobnia and the adjacent neutral state of
Litzen burg. This is the setting for I rilOCOITCS Border Zone, a
spy thriller in which you play three separate parts in three
separate but linked adventures.
The game begins on the night train from Frobnia to
Litzenberg. You are a tired businessman and not enjoying
the bumpy journey at all, simply glad t o be out fr om
behind the iron curtain. You were even lucky enough to get a
compartment t o  yourself but then y our  luck changes.
Suddenly, the compartment door ﬂies open and a man
who's obviously been shot in the arm staggers in and gives
you a document. Although the document is written entirely
in Frobnian you realise it's important and agree to give it to
the contact at the next station and foil a plot to assassinate
the American ambassador. The agent is soon gone leaving
you with a fresh bloodstain on the carpet. a white carnation
pinned t o  y our lapel (the sign for  the contact) and a
document that could get you arrested. You look outside into
the train's corridor and see that police are everywhere and a
man i n  a  trench c oat going f r o m compartment t o
compartment and he's only three doors away from yours!
Whatever. you are going to do you'd better do it fast as if
your arise suspicion you won't be allowed off the train to
hand the document to the contact who you don't know who
speaks a language you don't understand. If you solve that lot
and have listened carefully to the agent and meet the contact
you can warn the authorities of the impending assassination
attempt and then climb back on the train that will take you
to safety.
In part two, you are once again travelling towards the
border but this time you're the American agent and you've
just .
and already you can hear packs of dogs looking for you and
even the sound o f  an approaching car. You dismiss the
chance that the car passengers will help you and dive into the
safety of the woods and see a hut. As you approach the hut
the car pulls up and guards climb out and if they don't see
and arrest you then warn the hut's occupant that you're on
the loose. This leaves you cold, wounded, hunted and alone.
The border lies just to the North but before you get there

you will have to avoid the guards and dogs and your state
health before you work out how to avoid the searchlight-.
border guards and fences of the border that lies between
and safety.
In chapter three you are a Russian double agent sent h •
the KG B to look after the assassination attempt o f  ft,
visitng American ambassador. You're there to ensure th.r
all goes well although the Kremlin has found an Iranian
pull the trigger and deﬂect the blame from Moscow.
It is now L I:47 and you're standing in the square in thc
Litzenberg border town of Ostn itz. In under ﬁve minutes Ili.
Ambassador will speak in the square and the assassin w
strike. Unfortunately, you are a double agent and must stor
the sniper! You might get some help from your KGB contac
Riznik who owns an antique shop but again you're on vot.r
own. You must stop the assassination without alarming th
police, the Russians or being caught by the American ager
who you have just spotted in the cafe. I f  he sees you heT
shoot and ask questions later. The resulting conclusion
the game is a desperate race against time in which you mu
save the ambassador without blowing your cover.
To help you in your three missions the game disk 1
accompanied by the usual superb Infocom packaging whicl
includes a map of the Border Zone, a matchbook from IL
Frobnian railways, a Frobnian tourist guide and phra,.•
book and a business card from Riznik's antiques.
Border Zone is  packed with the Infocom style teo
descriptions that pile on the atmosphere and tension which '-
enhanced as this is the ﬁrst real time Infocom adventure. A
clock at the top of the screen ticks the minutes by that coulc
bring the man in the trenchcoat closer, the guards and thcli
dogs nearer or the assassins ﬁnger to the trigger.
It's not as difﬁcult as some other Infocom adventur,
and also includes on-line hints that could guide you to ilk
solutiuon (only use these if you're absolutely desperate). .\
tense spy thriller which casts you in three major parts.

data transfer between machines -
speciﬁcally the 64/128 and the Amiga
-  us ing asynchronous RS232 a n d
Kermit o r  ) ( modem t i l e  transfer
protocols. Not long after I wrote it. I
had a  phone c all fr om an ICPUG
member who was trying to do exactly'
that, except he was using the parallel
user port on the 64 hooked up to the
parallel printer port on the Amiga.
Thinking about it, this is not an
unreasonable way to go about it, and
it's certainly cheaper than buying an
RS232 interface for the 64, especially if
vou're at the stage of transferring tiles
to a new machine, you are likely to he
in imminent danger of selling the old
one. There is a problem though. The
parallel printer (PRT:) on the Amiga.
and indeed on any PC is an output
device only. It iseasy to send data from
the new computer to the old 'one but
not vice versa.
By a  strange coincidence. t h e
Amiga's general I / 0  chips (8520s) are
register compatible with the 6526s on a
64. Both are called ClAs! Thus, we are
in a  position t o  bypass the built-in
device dr iv er s  a n d  pr ogr am t h e

BASIC, t h e  c ode i s  pretty  muc h
identical for both machines -  only the
addresses h a v e  been changed t o
protect the innocent.
Now, what I  am proposing here is,
naughty. strictly speaking. since the
multi-tasking rationale behind Amiga
strongly disuades us from hacking the
hardware directly - what if some other
task legally tries to use PRT? OK. I
plead guilty here, but needs must. etc..
and what Amiga DOS won't do.. Just

ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE
Al—is it within reach
of the humble micro
or is it just
for the big boys ? Read on
By
Mary Branscombe

T
Intelligence (or Al as it is also known)
is that it means a great many things to
different people -  c ertainly  o u r
demands on an Al system are likely to
change a s  o u r  conception o f  A I
becomes more deﬁnite (or at least, less
fuzzy!).
As a  result. I  have decided t o
concentrate o n  o n e  p a r t ic u la r
language - LISP - the language central
to the whole development of Artiﬁcial
Intelligence and, more recently, as a
core to the latest fourth generation
languages - 4GLs for short. Of course
there have been examples o f  other
languages ideally  s uited f o r  A l
applications -  n a m e l y  M i c r o
PROLOG and even operating systems
such as SmallTalk for VAX and PDP
computers, but these are derivative,
and can be seen as having their roots
ﬁrmly embedded in LISP.
LISP is a language of contrasts. As
it is one o f  the ﬁrst "ac ademic "
languages it is still looking forward.
and because of its history as a good
expert system generator. it has found
itself enmeshed in the world of Al.
LISP has risen in popularity since
its completion as a full mainframe
compiler back in the seventies. Due to
large amounts of money being poured
into the design of a ﬁfth generation
computer, it is likely that within the
next ﬁve years we will all be as familiar
with an expert system as we are with
the wordprocessor today . Alr eady
such commercial applications o f  A l
research are in  common use today,
helping out on the factory Floor, taking
the strain and tedium from everyday
working at a steel rolling mill as it
controls the vital combination of air
and heat.
A doc tor has  c ommitted h i s
lifelong working knowledge of brain
growths to an expert system written
using LISP as a front end processing
package to analyze brain defects from
a brain scan.
Figure I
PTEHT'TE'T''
Dina structure diagram of a typical sequential path written in LISP. This prms the heart of many lisp
programs
F U T U R E S
The applications i n  A l  ar e all
around us , and lik e the s o called
"silicon revolution", the acceptance of
Al is taking place very quietly. not
behind our backs, hut right under our
noses.
LISP on a Micro
So wher e d o  mic r o based L I S P
implementations come into all of this?
And more to the point, what possible
impact can a  microcomputer based
version of the language do in a ﬁeld of
computer science r apidly  gaining
momentum? The answer is. quite a lot.
In order to look at Al, we have to
look at the way we consider the outside
world, the way we consider things that
possess "intelligence" -  one person's
view o f  intelligence is  likely t o  be
directly at odds with another view.
Some people think that the computer
is "intelligent" when it plays a move in
a game of  chess, other people think
such a n  approach i s  worse than
moronic, but the fact is . it  is  still
possible to program a  computer to
beat a world master at his own game!
Micro P R O L O G  i s  a n o t h e r
language used in Al.  It's a language
designed t o  w o r k  o n  t h e  s ame
programming structures as LISP, that
is using a system of logic commonly
termed as predicate logic, but whereas
micro PROLOG is better suited to the
logical programming precepts we have
grown to know and love in languages
more down to earth such as Pascal and
Comal. LISP has taken a radical new
angle on the subject, one which has
tremendous applications in the world
of A l ,  a n d  t h a t  i s  i n  "s y mbol
manipulation".
It i s  many  intelligent people's
opinion that the one thing that makes
us intelligent, is our ability to absorb
symbols, ﬁnd a common factor, and
represent that symbol in another way.
That is known as learning! When we
get to the stage whereby we can make

assumptions such as "the sun sets in
the west" and so on, we are beginning
to rely on sense data being fed to us.
which we absorb and can postulate
such theories as "either the sun, or the
earth rotates around the other".
This is called "predicate learning"
and is one o f  the greatest stumbling
blocks i n  t h e  w or ld o f  computer
science, because the next step we take
will force our line of research in one
direction o r  another. I n  order t o
achieve the "intelligent machine" we
must make the right choice. D o we
assume t h a t  "predic ate lear ning"
processes are achieved by a strict order
by deductive process (so our reasoning
and learning is  made possible by  a
series o f  questions t o  which we are
given input). On the other hand do we
assume that the ability to manipulate
huge quantities o f  symbols and re-
package that information in another
way is indicative of "intelligence

LISP i s  a  c o m p u t e r  language

somebody could xs rite an arcade game

the name of a variable without a quote
mark the value assigned by the SETQ
statement will be produced.
As with mic ro PROLOG. LISP
requires a completely new approach to
the way we program. T o this extent
LISP and micro PROLOG share many
similarities, and even a few more in the
language constructs itself, but we have
to move away from the "sequential
ﬂow" that the ﬂowchart has instilled
m our programming ideologies and is.

programming languages s uc h a s
BASIC, CO MAL and the like.
Consider a list o f  information: it
consists of' a number of items, each of
which, except the last, has a successor.
LISP wishes to treat lists as a class of
objects which can be referred to in a
uniform way , irrespective o f  their
length. The idea that lists c an be
traversed by stepping along them one
element at a time helps greatly.
LISP also allows identiﬁers and
numbers to be mixed freely with lists.
It is a means in itself o f  handling
everything via pointers.
in the case of lists, these pointers
will identify an individual item of data.
called a cell; each half of which contain
another pointer. The left hand pointer
(ﬁrst in the cell) leads t o the ﬁrst
clement in the stored list, while the
right h a n d  o n e  p o in t s  t o  t h e
remainder. S o  f o r  t h e  l i s t
(ABC I 2 ...) we get the picture in
ﬁgure one. Such lists can be organised
into sub lists or arbitrary depths, such
F U T U R E S
as the illustration in ﬁgure two.
Now it is probably clear why LISP
is s uc h a  g o o d  general purpose
database generating language, as it has
nearly all o f  the functions and data
structures inherent in a database built
in to the structure of the language.
Tests and Comparisons
The ability to deﬁne a function so that,
by means of a simple call, structured
information may be built, stored or
retrieved, or arithmetic performed on
an arbitrary piece of data, is a common
feature o f  LISP. However, far more
interesting programs can be produced
once functions arc written capable of
using what some people might call
"intelligence", considering argument
data fr om a  function, and making
decisions about what to do next on the
basis o f  The functions ﬁndings. I n
other words LISP needs to make tests
on and comparisons between data.

considered to be any situation where
the data returned from a function is
not "false", thus we can use the word I
to represent this quantity, (likewise F
exists for its "false" counterpart).
LISP functions that are thought of
as returning "true" values are known
as predicates. Their main use is  in
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
61
c onjunc t ion w i t h  c o n d i t i o n a l
expressions built up using the special
function COND. The general form of
such expressions are:
(COND)
(predicate I expression 1)
(predicate 2 expression 2)
(T ﬁnal expression)
There can be as many, or as k w
predicate expression pairs as required.
When L I S P  ﬁn d s  a  C O N D
expression, i t  starts evaluating the
given predicates in order. The value it
returns is that of the expression which
is paired with the ﬁrst predicate to
yield a "true" (i.e. the ﬁrst expression
to be returned with a non NIL) value.
In t h e  previous example, t h e
constant T is used as a ﬁnal predicate.
Since this always has the value "true",
the corresponding ﬁnal expression can
be seen as a default. The result to be
returned in all of the other predicates is
therefore " fals e" . T hus , expressed
without the brackets, the conditional
form can be read as:
IF p r e d i c a t e  I is "true"
THEN r e t u r n  t h e  v a l u e  o f
expression I
ELSE IF  pr edic ate 2 is "true"
ELSE r e t u r n  v a lu e  o f  Final
expression
When L I SP requires composite
predicates. it can build them up using
AND and OR. Each of these functions
can cope with an arbitrary number of
arguments. T h e y  ev aluate thes e
arguments one a t  a  time until the

normal rules of logic allow them to
return a  result. Thus A N D  will
evaluate arguments until it reaches the
end of the list (and returns T) or until it
ﬁnds th a t one o f  i ts arguments
evaluates to NIL.
OR will stop evaluating and return
T as soon as i t ﬁnds a non N IL
argument. Pieces of LISP code which
seem t o  require a  complex nest
structures of COND, AND. OR and
NOT are usually best re-written as
groups of smaller functions.
The LISP System on a Micro
When you write a number of functions
using LISP you are bound to make
mistakes, after all that is part of the fun
connected with computer program-
ming. When LISP encounters an error.
a number of things will occur.
Your answers will either end up
making total nonsense (the worst kind
of error), or, if you're lucky, you will
be greeted with an error message. and
a confusing collection and list of LISP
expressions.
This list is called a "back trace"
and i s supposed to  help you with
debugging, although some mainframe
LISP systems use the back trace to
make educated "guesses" at what the
error is, and where it is most likely to
be.
One o f  the ﬁrst actions upon
getting an error message, is to check
whether the error really is an erfor,
and not just an unexpected result, an
entirely virtuous human misinterpre-
tation on behalf of the computer.
Once you have traced the logic of
the program b y  using th e  data
structure diagram (as all things centre
round the data, the integrity of the
data i s  th e  second thing t o  b e
considered at fault). The fun really
begins, and where LISP, thankfullv
enough abounds at being able to help
in isolating an error, as you can
examine all o f  the quantities ever
passed to LISP functions and all the
values that can ever get returned as
results can be read and printed.
The only time when you cannot
examine the integrity of the function is
where problems occur with function
entry points and w i th  re-entrant
structures such as breaking out of a
loop structure by direct means. (a bit
like issuing a GOTO inside a FOR
NEXT loop).
When all else fails, it is time to pull
in the heavy mob, in the form of a
function called TRACE. This can be
used to  see how values get passed
F U T U R E S
between functions i n  a  complex
calculation. Again, the object of using
it i s  t o  isolate a  single function
returning incorrect results, and to
exhibit arguments which lead to bad
behaviour.
If the bad function is a simple
mistake, then it will be easy to correct
the error, save the program and try
again. However, if all else fails, then all
that is left open to the programmer is a
long night sitting over a dry run chart
and a lot of paper.
LISP and Al
Al consists of a number of apparently
diverse areas, some of which have been
hinted at. One in particular was the
analysis of data trees and a simple type
of game. This can be taken further.
Imagine what happens as the tree
grows bigger, the number of branches
so great that they start to interact, to
produce a loop in the tree structure.
This latest idea is used in the "mouse
concept" whereby a  small robot is
placed in a maze. and is quite literally
left alone t o  learn about its new
environment.
In this example the mouse is left to
make a pathway in order to get from
one part of a maze to another. If this
seems pretty futile, examine th e
concepts o f examining the possible
movements. This same concept has
been used in databases and even in a
special version o f chess, to ﬁnd the
quickest way of getting from point A
to B. This could be used to develop fast
search operations (LISP has been used
to write wordprocessors and screen
editors in its past).
A famous LISP program, written
mainly a s a  joke has become a
notorious addition to any LISP system
and is great for breaking the ice at
parties! Called ELIZA, it is a simple
questibn and answer session between a
computer and its operator, sometimes
the results can be stunning:
Operator:

My father hated me.
Tell me more about youc
family.
I remember my unhappy
childhood.
Do you often think of
your unhappy child-
hood?
No. I can't.
Tell me why you can't.
This is a section from a typical
LISP dialogue, and as you can see, the
operator is already opening up his
heart to what is essentially a plastic
box with a TV on top of it!
I would be surprised if ELIZA has
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
62
any therapeutic value,especially as the
Operator eventually gets annoyed at
the lack o f feedback, just questions
and no answers: but to begin with, we
are willing to  tell all, to  convince
ourselves t h a t  t h e r e  i s  a
compassionate. thinking behind the
computer screen and the results tell us
a lot more about our demands from Al
than what we originally think.
I hope that this proves my last
point. The fact that Al also relies on
the fact that we are willing to attribute
intelligence to a series of rules and
statements for at least some o f the
time. Regardless o f how a piece of
software is written, if it at least gives
the appearance o f  behaving
intelligently, that is enough for some.
LISP will not turn your computer
into a silicon prodigy. nor will it even
hope t o  compete w i th  complex
applications such as sentence and
word structure analysis (as is being
researched by the Lotus corporation
for a  "context checker" t o  check
sentence structure for bad use of the
English language) but what LISP will
allow is some fairly comprehensive
database and list processing programs
to be written.
In addition t o  this. L ISP i s
perfectly capable of supporting a full
parser for direct text entry. so it may
ﬁnd itself applications i n  expert
systems and simulation and modelling
programs that require aspects of the
real world to  be simulated. Again
LISP is the ideal front end for this as
nearly 70 per cent of the functions deal
exclusively w i t h  co n d i ti o n a l
comparisons.
I have seen a chess program being
written using LISP. Although this is
purely an exercise, it should give an
indication a s t o  just how serious

company in the UK, having set up
ofﬁces here just too late to get a stand
at last year's British Music Fair. They
are a well known and much respected
name in America, and they have no
less than 18 MIDI programs and two
MIDI Interfaces for the Commodore.
The Hardware
Let's get straight down to business and
look at the hardware side of any MIDI
set-up -  t he  Interface. Sonus's
Standard MIDI Interface has a MIDI
In and two M ID I Outs. It's well
constructed and housed in a sturdy
black plastic case which plugs into the
Cartridge Por t. Sonus's othe r
Interface has tape sync. For serious
recording with a  multi-track tape
recorder you will need some sort of
sync to tape facility to allow you to
overdub a number of parts onto tape
while maintaining sync with each
other.
When you have more than two
pieces of MIDI equipment you may
need to consider a Thru Box such as
Sonus's 2 In K Out MT70. It can help
make more sense of all those MIDI
connections,
The manuals say Sonus's software
will run with Syntec, Passport,
Yamaha (not generally available in the
UK) and Sequential MIDI Interfaces
and. in fact it should also run with
Datel. SIEL. Jellingaus and Steinberg
models, too, but it's best to check to
make sure.
Super Sequencer
We'll begin with the biggy - the Super
Sequencer. There are two versions
R E V I E W S
When many companies seem to be forsaking the music
potential of the Commodore 64 for the bright lights of
the Atari ST, it's encouraging to ,ﬁnd a company like
Sonus with more Commodore MIDI products than all
the other companies put together

available, one for the 64 and one for
the 128. The  128 version takes
advantage of the extra memory and it
doesn't cost a  penny more. All the
other Sonus programs will work on the
128 in 64 mode.
Super Sequencer operates very
much like an audio tape recorder, a
method of working with which most
musicians are familiar. They are Play.

tracks of 16 sequences which can be
chained together to form a song. and
up to four songs can be stored in
memory at once although they can
only be made up from the one set of 16
sequences.
There is one main screen in which
all the recording and editing takes

CTRL or  Shift and CTRL. It can
appear overwhelming at ﬁrst but they
are arranged fairly logically and a little
use soon breeds familiarity. I would
have preferred to be able to access all
the functions with just one hand,
though.
Super Sequencer lets you select
throe PPQN (pulses per quarter note)
values which give different recording
resolutions (although the  smaller
values will usually be quite adequate).
You can drive a drum machine via the
MIDI Clock or the sequencer can be
driven by an external clock.
Super Sequencer has virtually
every facility you would expect to ﬁnd
in a  professional M I D I  sequencer
program. T h e  exact lengths o f

ill
sequences arc easy to set and each
sequence can have a different tempo.
Tracks and sequences can be named -
very useful -  and given individual
channel and velocity settings. You can
also ﬁlter out unwanted MIDI data.
Counters can be used to set auto
punch in and out points, and tracks can
be bounced down to create a backup
track or  to free a  track so more•
recording can be done.
The Track Menu features Auto
Correction with a resolution of up to
32-note triplets. Tracks can b e
transposed a nd shifted back and
forward in time to compensate for
timing errors.
Sequences can be appended to
themselves o r  other sequences.
transposed and shifted. In the song
screen, up to 24 sequences can be
chained together. Each sequence can
be set to repeat up to nine times and
given its own transposition and auto-
mute setting. This allows you t o
choose only to play selected tracks in
the eight-track sequence.
Other features include Omni Off
send (for those synthesisers which
always start up in Omni mode), a Seam
Manager to tidy up the end of a section
and Play Through t o allow your
master keyboard t o  play another
instrument on a different channel.
There are step-time facilities, too.
The Return Key can be programmed
to step the clock on by a set amount
and used t o  move through the
recording. It's simple, perhaps not an
ideal method, but it's effective.

is very similar to the Super Sequencer
and shares many o f  its editing.
recording and M ID I functions (but
not the system Exclusive Dump).
Glass Tracks, however, only allows
you to construct one 16-element song
made up from eight sequences of eight
tracks each. A  single sequence can't
repeat or be transposed. Altogether
Glass Tracks is not as powerful or
ﬂexible as the Super Sequencer but
then it is less than half its price and it
will comfortably handle many
applications.
The screen layout and menu-
driven functions operate in the same
way and you can swap ﬁles between
programs. The program disk contains
some excellent demos. Glass Tracks
would be an ideal program if you didn't
want to commit yourself to the price of
a Super Sequencer. It. too, has an
excellent manual.
Personal Musician
If you're still not convinced that
making music with MIDI can be both
easy and fun then Sonus's Personal
Musician may be worth looking at. It's
a complete package containing easy-
to-use software and a MIDI Interface
plus cables.
It was designed for entry-level
users v e t  s t ill maintains ﬁle
compatibility with Sonus's more
comprehensive programs. The manual
includes 'Introduction to MIDI* and
'Synthesiser' sections and the program
disk contains a selection of Christmas
carols (better late than never)as well as
other demo tunes.

MIDI Processor 64
All in all, the Son us sequencers are
excellent pr ogr ams . T h e  Su p e r
Sequencer i s  c er tainly  t h e  mos t
comprehensive, but it's main omission
is the lack of a note editor. Now. such
editing involves getting down to the
bits and bytes of MIDI data and may
not appeal to everyone but it could
save a lot of time and trouble if. for
example, you needed to correct just
one note i n  a n  otherwise perfect
sequence. Such an error in an audio
recording would require a re-take or a
punch in and you can use the Super
Sequencer's auto punch in features to
do this.
Son us's MIDI Processor, however,
lets you do this and more. It is a stand-
alone program but it can load and save
sequencer ﬁles. I t  c an be used t o
examine M I D I  d a t a  a n d  remove
unwanted program changes, pitch and
mod wheel data. I t  c an als o 'un-
bounce% a  process whic h involves
extracting information o n  a  giv en
channel and putting i t  on another
track.
It has its own mini-sequencer so
you can record additional tracks and
add them to your piece although its
main purpose is to test the results of
your edits. The Range Edit feature lets
you work on just a range o f  events
rather than a  complete tr ac k  o r
sequence.
Mid iTech 64
Sonus describe M id iT e c h  a s  a
monitor/system exclusive librarian. It
is t o  M I D I  d a t a  w h a t  a n
assembler/monitor i s  t o  mac hine
code. We're really down among the
bits and the bytes in MidiTech as most
information is displayed in hex which
should give computer users less of a
headache than musicians.
MidiTech c a n  b e  us ed a s  a
diagnostic aid to check suspect MID I
data or  to edit it. Yo u  could. for
example, load in a Super Sequencer
ﬁle, edit note or event information and
resaye it. Not the easiest way of doing
things. I admit, but it illustrates the
potential.
More practically, it can be used to
initiate a MI D I  dump request from
instruments without a manual dump
sent on their front panel such as
Casio's CZ-I01, 11 D ump Requests
are included on the program disk.
MidiTech also has  a  128 by te
Trigger Buffer which holds a series of
data it must receive before it begins
recording MID I data, This would be
used t o  start data reception after a
certain event had been enabled such as
the use of' a mod wheel or a program
change.
There are selectable MI D I  ﬁlters,
captive Play  Through a n d  editing
features.
MidiTech is a fascinating program,
unlike any other MID I program I've
seen, T he average -  and even the
super-average musician m a y  never
need to use its facilities as the MID I
Processor should ﬁll their needs. A
MIDI technician, however, or  data
buff will have a ﬁeld day and somehow
it's reassuring to know that a program
like this exists. You may just need it
one day.
Score Track
R E V I E W S
Most M I D I  sequencing programs
display the music they record as a
series of numbers, They are generally
quite easy to edit but it's often useful to
be able to see the music in traditional
notation,
Score Track does just that. In fact,
it's a  s elf- c ontained s equenc er
program with real and step-time input.
It was written by Gerhard Lengeling
who wrote C-Lab's programs and it
betrays its roots by displaying a C-Lab
logo in the Edit screen. Operation is
with s ingle k e y  commands -  a s
opposed t o  Sonus 's  multi- menu
system -  and it's a very easy program
to use.
You can record 64 Patterns each
with up to 16 tracks and arrange them
into a  Song containing u p  t o  256
Pattern Positions. There is a muting
function so the same pattern can be
used i n  .different pos itions  w i t h
different tracks playing.
The dis k  contains a  converter
program s o  y o u  c an lo a d  Super
Sequencer ﬁles. There are facilities
such as track copying and bouncing,
quantisation, transposition, ghos t
tracks and various delay options to get
tracks and drum machines in sync.
Recording takes place in the Song
and Pattern screen. To see a track in
traditional notation you go to the Edit
screen. The music is shown on a treble
and bass clef and beneath the stave are
options t o  alter various parameters
which affect the display. These include
quantisation, minimum note length.
legato (to avoid chords forming during
minimal overlapping), staccato (to set
the m i n i m u m  r e s t  le n g t h )  a n d
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988

transpose. The screen updates after
each keypress and you can see how the
alterations affect the music.
Beneath the stave is an event editor
which shows the time of the start of the
event, the note name and duration it'
it's a  n o t e  o r  a n y  as s oc iated
parameters if it's not. The cursor on
the stave is linked to one in the event
editor so you always see how the two
ﬁt together.
You can enter, insert and delete
notes and events and although you can
write a  piece directly t o  the stave
(principally by directly inserting notes)
if you can ﬁnd your way around a
keyboard y ou can probably enter a
piece just as easily in step-time from
the Pattern screen.
The print out is basically a dump of
what's on the screen.
Unfortunately, the stave has  a
range o f  o n ly  f o u r  octaves a n d
although notes outside this range are
shown in the event editor they appear
on the stave as rests and are printed as
such.
In spite of its limitations - there is a
limit to what you can cram into a
after all -  Score Track is  a  nic e
program and if  you like to see your
music in traditional form a s  I do - it
can be recommended.

Voice Editors
Sonus have a range of voice editors for
many of the most popular synthesisers
on the market. Voice editors serve
three functions, Firstly, as most synths
are digital. programming new sounds
nytmally requires the adjustment o f
donns (possibly hundreds) of numeric
parameters. Q u it e  often t h e  only
display on the synth is a small LC D
which can only show the value of one
parameter a t  a  time. W i t h  these
restrictions, it's  not easy try ing t o
work out how a sound is constructed.
Software can help by showing all
the parameters together on one screen
- or several screens if the synth has so
many parameters - and by translating
some o f  the numbers into graphs -
envelope and waveform shapes. for
example.

Secondly, th e  voices o n  most
synths are arranged in banks and you
will often want to load a selection of
voices into a  bank i n  a  particular
order. Trying to arrange voices in this
way on the actual synth can be very
hard work indeed but with a computer
it's a doddle.
Thirdly, voice editors 'let you save
voice data to disk. The usual method
of storage is a plug-in RAM pack or a
dump to a cassette. In terms of sheer
convenience -  and a saving in RAM
packs - a voice editor can soon pay for
itself several times over.
Casio Programmer Librarian
Like Sonus's other programs, their
CZ/PL (Casio CZ Programmer/Lib-
rarian) is driven from a series of menus
called up with the function keys. Shift
and CTRL. The program can store
two banks of 16 voices and has an edit
buffer. You can load and save voices to
and from these, the CZ synth and disk.
The program's banks a re  called
Cartridges, not to be confused with the
CZ's RAM cartridge.
You can swap voices from bank to
bank and buffer to buffer with the
press o f a few keys. Some o f these
swaps are activated from sub-levels of
the menu and require three key presses
to activate and then a conﬁrmative Y
or N so you don't overwrite. You do
get used to the system after a while,
especially a fte r using th e  Sonus
sequencers but I wonder if a slightly
different approach could have made
the process simpler.
The Edit screen shows all the
numeric parameters a t  a  glance
although you have to press Space to
swap between DC01 and DCO2. The
layout is not arranged in the same
order as the synth or the Casio CZ
patch charts - and hence the normally
accepted method o f  writing voice
parameters -  and slight though the
difference is. it makes copying patches
from charts just that shade more
difﬁcult. The data is illustrated purely
as numbers -  there are no graphs.
unfortunately -  b u t, t o  b e  fa i r.
although some voice editors have
graphs, most don't.
However, once you get the hang of
things - and a little familiarity goes a
long way -  the program can aid
programming enormously.
Compared with the price of RAM
cartridges, th e  program cost w i l l
quickly be recouped as you can save
any number o f  banks o f  voices
conveniently to disk. The CZ/PL disk
R E V I E W S
contains 10 banks of 16 voices so that's
a nice plus. Casio Digital Disks are
also available containing 10 more
banks of voices and you can buy patch
charts from various sources which you
can type into the program.
DX-TX Design
If you have a Yamaha DX or TX 7,216
or 816 synth or expander then the DX-
TX Double Banked Librarian &
Programmer - to give it its full title -
does for these instruments what the
CZ/PL does for the Casio CZ synths.
It uses the same sort of function
key menu system and displays the
parameters numerically over three
screens -  darned full o f parameters
these DX/TX thingies! It can hold two
banks of 32 sounds and includes an AB
compare feature. The disk contains
eight banks of 32 sounds and a DX-TX
Digitial Disk is available containing
over 500 sounds.
FB-01 Design
If you have a Yamaha Fa-Oland want
to program your own voices then you
must have some software to do it as the
FI3-01 lacks the necessary buttons to
be programmed by itself.
F13-01 Design retains the Sonus
function key menu features and lets
you do to the EB-01 what the other
editors let vou do to their respective
instruments.
ESQ-1 Design, TX816 Design
and DX21,27,100 Support
programs
These cater fo r  Ensoniq's ESQ-1
Synthesiser, Yamaha's T X B I
expander module and Yamaha's 4-
operator DX21 DX27 and DX100
synthesisers.
1 1/21 Librarian
Here's something slightly different a
librarian fo r a drum machine. The
program contains over 150 patterns
including jatz, latin and rock sets. You
can edit and store patterns and mixes
and a d d  a  20-line comment t o
individual patterns.
It is menu driven, Sonus style and
displays a grid showing which patterns
have been recorded. There are no
facilities for composing new patterns
or songs which is a shame - it is purely
a Librarian after all -  but it is more
useful and convenient than storing
songs on tape.

Sonic Editors
Two of Sonus's most recent programs
are Sonic Editors for the Ensoniq
Mirage and Sequential's Prophet.
These are menu-driven waveform
editors which display wavesample and
program parameters and let you step
through the samples page by page to
ﬁnd the best looping points. You can
also d ra w  yo u r  o w n  waveforms
directly into the system.
You can store sets of 78 sounds
(each containing a  single page
waveform and 36 preset parameters)
on a disk and a library o f 78 pre-
programmed sounds are provided.
Sonus Demo Disk
Finally. if you prefer your information
to be presented visually, then the
Demo Disk lists the features and gives
you screen shots of eight of the main
Sonus programs. None are interactive.
however, but you can take advantage
of Sonus's special I4-day money back
guarantee t o  make sure that the
program you buy does what you want
it to  do. Contact Sonus for more
details.
Summary
The S o n  us programs a re  well-
conceived pieces of software although
some o f the Voice Editors, though
functional, could have been more
inspiring. The Sequencers and Score
Track especially are certainly worth a
close look i f  you're after your ﬁrst
piece of MIDI sequencing software.
You can see th a t Sonus are
dedicated t o  su p p o rti n g  th e
Commodore's music potential. Write
to them fo r more details o f  their
products or speak to Rosemary. one of
the most helpful people in the biz on
the other side of a telephone. Sonus
have many special offers i f you buy
two or more of their products.
The Commodore 64 and 128 still
have a lot going for them in the music
stakes and the availability of the Sonus
range o f  software w i l l  hopefully
encourage anyone who has not yet
taken the plunge into MIDI music to
do so.

For disk users it is a good idea to

to remember all those SYS calls as the

will autorun when loaded.
Getting it all in
The program is presented in the form
of a BASIC  loader and should be
either typed o r  loaded in  after the
following line has been typed:
PO KE 4 3 , 1 : PO KE 44, 32: PO KE
8192,0:NEW
Once run, the BASIC loader will
generate another BASI C  ty pe ﬁle
called 'Gyrospeed' and save it on to
disk. If using tape then read the REM
statements in the program.
The program can then be loaded
like an ordinary BASIC program.

CP/M
Assembly
Language
Programming
i
Commodore, you should already know
about many of the features offered by
the CP/M+ Operating System. If this
has prompted you to experiment, you
are now no doubt well aware, that
after booting CP/M, all you see on the
screen is A >  .  This is not terribly
tnformative, so we are now going to
use a simple little program that will
make C P/ M display a menu o f  the
program ﬁles on the disk and let you
select one by a single key press.
Assemblers and Compilers
Before y ou c an create any  C P / M
programs, you need either a Z80 or
8080 Assembler o r  a  h ig h  lev el
language c ompiler. T h e  latter  o f
course, is very much easier and for
around 0 0 ,  you can buy a top class
compiler such as F T L Modula 2 or
Turbo Pascal. As  this is likely to be
beyond the budget o f  many readers,
we will stick to Assembly Language.
The assembler I  hav e used is
GEN80 by Hisoft. This is sold as a
package called DEVPAC80, whic h
also includes one of the few CP/M full
C128 P R O G R A M M I N G

screen editors and a ﬁrst class front
panel debugger . T h e  as s embler
supports the proper Zilog Z80 op-
codes and pseudo-ops and has very
powerful macro capabilities. At  just
under i'40 this package is very good
value for  money and I  thoroughly
recommend it.
If you don't have this package, but
have a copy of M80 you can assemble
the p r o
the DEFx pseudo-ops to INTEL style
DB, DS. I'm afraid if  you only have
the Digital Research MAC assembler
you w i l l  h a v e  p r o b l e m s .  I
experimented by changing the pseudo-
ops and including Z80.1-1B and got
about 50 errors. Rather than ﬁnding
all the alternate I N T EL op-codes I
would suggest that you use SID  t o
enter the H E X  dump and consider
buying a proper Z80 assembler.
Making a Program Auto-start
CP/M's popularity as an operating
system has never had very much to do
with either  i t s  fac ilities  o r  us er
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988

friendliness. In fact in one review of
the leading Z 8 0  based operating
systems it came last in most categories.
Its success lie s  i n  i t s  eas e o f
implementation on a wide variety of
hardware. However, w it h  C P/M+,
Digital Research tackled many of its
shortcomings. One new feature was a
simple means  o f  auto-starting a
program. T h e  mechanism i s  very
simple. During a cold-start, the system
disk i s  s ear c hed f o r  t h e  ﬁle
PROFILESUB. If the ﬁle is found,an
attempt i s  m a d e  t o  execute the
command:
A >  SUBMIT PROFILE
To make use o f  this we need to
make up a system disk with the tiles:
CP/M+.SYS
CCP.COM
SUBMIT.COM
We then use an editor to create the
ﬁle PROFILESUB, which is a text ﬁle
and contains the single line:
MENU <cr >

In future when this disk is booted,
SUBMIT.COM i s  r u n ,  i t  r eads
PROFILESUB a n d  attempts  t o
execute our program MENU,COM.
Z80 Assemhley Language
To those familiar with the 6502, the
Z80 instruction set may at ﬁrst seem a
little strange. The main differences are:
(i) most instructions have the form LD
dest.source.
(ii)there is no zero page, but many
registers; these c an b e  used singly
A.13,C,D,E,H,L. or in pairs AF , BC.
DE, H I  (the index registers IX. I Y
have not been used).
(iii)many operations do not set the
status bits and so it  must be done
explicitly e.g. OR A.
(iv) there a r e  a  f e w  c o m p l e x
instructions e.g. LD1R. which is used
for block moves and assumes that
certain registers are present.
Creating a Program Menu
The intention o f  our program is to
,generate a menu of the program ﬁles
on the disk, s o  the steps c an be
summarised as follows:
WHILE more ﬁles on disk
- ﬁnd next
- IF extension is .COM THEN
- display key and ﬁle name
- ENDIF
ENDWHILE
get key pressed
execute corresponding program
Directory Searching
CP/M makes directory searches very
easy for  us  b y  pr ov iding BD O S
function calls to do precisely what we
want. To use these we must know, how
to call a  BDO S function, how  t o
supply ﬁle information and where to
ﬁnd the information returned b y
CP/M.
Fortunately the ﬁrst two of these
arc quite simple. To make any BDOS
call, we ﬁrst set the function code in
register C and the function parameter
(if any) is placed in the register pair
DE. Finally we call the BDOS entry
point. 0005H. A  good example is
provided by the subroutine CHROUT
C128 P R O G R A M M I N G
at the start of the listing, which is used
to output a character to the screen,
For ﬁle related functions, i t  is
clearly not possible t o  pass all the
required information in a register pair,
so instead we pass the address of' a
parameter block called the FCB (File
Control Block). This  is  a standard
CP/M structure of which we will use
only a small portion for the ﬁlename
and ﬁletype.
FC13: 1 byte -  not used
8 bytes -  ﬁletype
3 bytes -  ﬁletype
21 bytes - not used
As we wish to ﬁnd any COM ﬁle.
we initialise ﬁlename t o  the string
"
are n o w  ready t o  use the BD O S
functions 17 and 18 to ﬁnd respectively
the ﬁrst and subsequent ﬁles matching
this speciﬁcation.
The response fr om C P / M  is  a
single byte value in  the A  register,
which the manual tells us is  either
OFFH (no ﬁle) or an offset multiplier.
The o f f s e t  m u l t i p l i e r  t e l l s  u s
whereabouts i n  t h e  D M A  (Direc t
Memory Access) area we will ﬁnd the
ﬁle data. The formula used is:
080H (L)MA default addr) + 32 * A
Menu Display &  Program
Execution
Having found the program ﬁles, it is
very simple to display the menu using
the standard BDOS calls for character
and string output and ﬁnally wait for a
user input using CO NIN. T he one
problem retraining is to activate the
selected program. This is done once
again by a BDOS call, which initially
requires the ﬁlename of selected ﬁle to
be placed at the start of the DMA area.
As you can see from the completed
program, most of the I/O  Operations
have been made very simple by CP/M
and t h e  majority  o f  the c ode i s
involved s imply  w i t h  c alc ulating
offsets to data and moving data from
one area to another.
To date, most discussion o f  the
Cl28's CP/M Mode has concentrated
on the range of business packages that
are available. Little has been said,
however, about wr iting y our  o w n
programs i n  this  mode. While the
limited screen display facilities mean
you are certainly not going to write the
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
71
next mega-hit arcade game in  this
mode, ther e r emain several g o o d
reasons f o r  w i d e n i n g  y o u r
programming horizons. Consider the
following:
-  f as t er  a n d  s impler  d is k  ﬁl e
operations,
- very wide choice o f  professional
program development packages.
- ﬁnished programs can be used on a
wide variety of computer systems,
-  lar ge bas e o f  Public  D o ma in
software, pr ov iding many  us eful
routines.
In this review we are going to look
at just some o f  the assemblers and
compilers available for  the C128 in
CP/M mode. At present there are few
UK retailers stocking these, but the
two companies mentioned at the end
of the article specialise in supply of
CP/M a n d  MS- DO S software a t
competitive prices. When ordering for
the C I 28 you should state either the
disk driv e (not 1541) or  the M E M
format e.g. KA YPRO
Assemblers
Even if you intend to program mainly
in a high level language, an assembler
is always useful for  those odd little
routines. T h e r e  a r e  t hr ee m a i n
contenders i n  this  market and the
choice w ill depend on the intended
usage.
If you get the Commodore CP/M
utilities pack, this contains the Digital
Research M A C  a n d  R  M AC
assemblers. Thes e a r e  I n t e l 8080
Assemblers and can be used to write
Z80 programs using the Z80 macro
library on the CP/M sources disk. This
is alright for short subroutines, but not
really s uitable f o r  w r it in g  lar ge
assembly language programs.
The mos t w idely  us ed C P / M
Assembler is M80 by Microsoft. This
has the advantage that you can choose
whether t o  u s e  Z 8 0  o r  8 0 8 0
mnemonics, which can be useful when
you w ant t o  mak e use o f  library
routines. This is a very comprehensive
package including a linker, librarian
and cross-reference utility . O n  the
negative s ide i t  uses mainly  Intel
Pseudo-ops and at around I.:80 is still
rather expensive.
At about half this price, Hisoft's
DEVPAC80 is  a  tr ue Z 80 Mac ro
Assembler package. This is the grown

up version o f  their very popular
Spectrum assembler package and has
the big bonus of a ﬁrst class full-screen
editor. T h i s  supports Wordsta r
commands as default, but you can
redeﬁne them how you like. The
second program i s  GEN 8 0  th e
assembler, which has a  powerful
MACRO facility and produces COM
ﬁles directly. I f  you have run-time
problems then you load up MON80 a
powerful front panel debugger which
allows y o u  t o  see j u s t what's
happening. A ﬁrst class package at a
very reasonable price.
BASIC
CP/M gives you a good opportunity to
come to grips with more sophisticated
programming languages, but those
who wish to remain faithful to the old
war horse are well catered for.
If you prefer an interpreter to a
Compiler. Mallard BASIC may be
worth a look. This is essentially the
same BASIC as used in the Amstrad,
but adapted fo r CP/M. Fo r some
reason Amstrad versions have more
features than others, but cost about
half the price and this should more or
less ensure that it is little used on other
machines.
A more obvious choice therefore
might be M-BASIC from Microsoft,
who wrote the Commodore's BA SICs.
Fortunately this version is much more
comprehensive than BASIC 2.0, but
you should have fe w  problems
adapting. This can still be rather an
expensive package and looks overdue
for a price cut. Watch out for package
deals with M80, if you are interested in
both. The main advantage is the large
quantity o f existing software in this
dialect.
C-BASIC. Digital Researches
Commercial BASIC also has large
libraries o f existing software. It has
some useful facilities, but is generally
rather lacking in features. Take care as
both interpreters and full compilers
are sold. A  budget priced version of
the compiler for the Amstrad is now
available, but it is generally expensive.
A fairly recent newcomer is Z-
BASIC. This i s  supposedly quite
similar to M-BASIC, but has some
nice extensions such as labelled GOTO
and GOSUB, automatic indenting and
variable precision for ﬂoating point
arithmetic. It also provides some nice
user facilities like those o f  Turbo
Pascal, and with very fast benchmarks
C128 P R O G R A M M I N G
and a price tag of around 00, looks
the pick of the bunch.
Pascal
If you are thinking of moving on from
BASIC. Pascal is the logical choice
and CP/M gives you the choice o f
some really top class products.
If you are an ICPUG member (and
you really should be if you are reading
Britain's only serious Commodore
Magazine!) then you can get JRT
Pascal for the price of an empty disk
and postage. Ask for disks CL2 &
CU. I  know nothing about this
compiler, but you can't grumble at the
price.
The compiler by which most others
are now judged is Borland's Turbo
Pascal. This sets new standards o f
performance, usability and price when
it was released and the opposition has
only recently started to catch up. It is
often criticised f o r  i ts very non-
standard Pascal extensions (what is a
standard extension?), but about half a
million satisﬁed users will tell you. that
this gives you a real 'do anything' high
level language system, Unlike many
Pascals, it also has adequate precision
for most scientiﬁc work. If you have
around £50. you can't go far wrong
with Turbo.
A good low cost alternative is
Pascal 80 f r o m  H i s o f t .  T h i s
comfortably wins the Pascal speed
stakes, but lacks accuracy in ﬂoating
point operations. The latest version is
packaged with ED80 and achieves
much of the user friendliness of Turbo
Pascal. At f40 this is a good package
for the beginner.
Two other compilers should also
be mentioned in this section. DR's MT
Pascal is a very good compiler. with
extensive CP/M libraries in existence,
but low cost versions have only as yet
appeared for the Amstrad. Purists of
course will insist on the full ISO
standard Prospero Pascal, it is just a
pity that they will probably have to sell
their 128 to buy it.
C is the high level language favoured
by assembly language programmers.
who are forced to  use a high level
language as it allows you to continue
writing unintelligible programs. To be
fair C is excellent for systems software.
Most CP/M compilers for C fall into
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
72
the category o f  'very expensive'.
BDSC, for example will set you back
over E100 and only supports integer
arithmetic. F o r  ﬂo a ti n g  p o i n t
capability the choice lies between
AZTEC C (approx 150) or ECO C,
which i s  depressingly slow b u t a
relative bargain at about .C80. For
systems work of course ﬂoating point
is not essential and Hisoft's offering at
around E40 should satisfy most needs.
although the performance is not that
exciting to say the least.
Modular 2
This i s  another language fro m
Nicholas Wirth, the author of Pascal
and is quite similar to ADA, but is
much easier to compile. If you can live
with a language in which FRED, fred
and Fred are all different variables, it's
very good and has the big advantage
that it is very easy to reuse bits of your
old programs. Until recently the cost
of a compiler used to be a deterrent,
but you can get a basic FTL Modula-2
compiler for 00.
With unusually good ﬂoating
point precision a n d  sensational
benchmarks, th i s product seems
destined t o  ﬁnally dislodge Turbo
Pascal from the top compiler spot.
One word of warning, however, while
Modular-2 is a very good language to
learn i t cannot be recommended to
those w i t h  n o  previous Pascal
experience, as good textbooks are very
expensive.
Fortran & COBOL
These very old languages cannot be
recommended unless you use them
already. Fortran is still useful for
scientiﬁc applications and at about
f.:40 Nevada Fortran is good value.
There is a similarly named and priced
COBOL compiler, b u t  f o r  data
intensive applications DBASE II is
probably a better bet.

e've mentioned r in g  modul-
W
ation brieﬂy, the art of modulating one
voice with respect to another, so that a
totally different kind of sound is pro-
duced. Rather than having one voice
trying to impersonate another, two (or
ihreelvoices are combined here to pro-
duce some t h a t  sounds at times.

This is because the frequency and
volume o f  one voice is  constantly
varying with respect to another, and it
is one of the w a s  available to us in

which must be set to the same value for
all three voices, c an be somewhat
overridden to give the effect of voices
playing at different volumes.
One simple way of doing this is to
play different waveforms at different
octave levels for different voices, but
ring modulation gives us a further, and
more accurate, way of' doing this.
Apart fr om altering volumes, it
also allows us to produce some very
interesting sound effects. On the debit
side, we haye to use at least two voices

However, the effects produced are well
wor th t h i s  a p p a r e n t l y  i n
limitation* and by  .
various settings we can still have three
very different sounds being produced
by the three voices.
The important thing to remember
is that what we are altering, when
modulating one voice with respect to
another, is the frequency and volume
of the note being played. I n  other
words, w h a t  w o u ld  hav e been a
constant frequenc y  play ed a t  a
constant v olume is  now a  variable
frequency at a variable volume - very
useful.
Some Rules
Wc c annot, o f  course, us e r i n g
modulation as and when we feel like it.
Disregarding t h e totally  unmusical
effects that might be produced as a
result of doing this, the Commodore 64
is not set up to be a true synthesiser,
and t r y  as  w e  might, w e  cannot
persuade it to do things that it wasn't
designed for.
Chief among the rules that must be
obeyed is that if we want to modulate
voice one with respect to voice,three,
voice one mus t h e  playing with a
triangle waveform. Voice three can be
using whatever waveform you Feel like,
white noise if vou want, but voice one
must be using that triangle waveform.
Similarly, modulating voice three
with respect to voice two means that
voice three must now have the triangle
waveform. O f course, there is nothing
to stop us setting all three voices to
triangle waveforms and modulating
the whole lot  w ith respect t o  each
other. This can be rather interesting.
Bits of information
In order to achieve this modulation we
must look to control registers 54276,
54283 and 54290, or using our base of
V=54272, then w e are altering the
content o f  registers V+4. V+ II and
V+19, These, as you are probably only'
too well aware, are the registers used to
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988

control the waveforms of the various
voices, so let's take a look at just one of
those registers. namely V+4.
128 064 032 016 008 (X)4 0)2 001
007 ())6 005 004 003 002 (XII OM
(XII M I  001 001 000 002 003 (X)I
This is  a multi-purpose register,
and we can riddle with every bit of bit
except bit three, which seems to have
no purpose in life, poor thing.
Bits seven. six, ﬁve. four and zero
are used purely for the waveform. That
is, POK Ling V+4 with either 128+ I.
64+1, 32+1 or  17+1 selects our white
noise, pulse. sawtooth o r  triangle
waveforms. POKEing V+4 with either
128, 64, 32 or 16 turns the waveform
off again, although a zero would do the
job just as well.
Bit two is the one that interests us
here. since this is the one that affects
the ring modulation. Setting this bit to
one turns ring modulation on, while
setting it to zero turns ring modulation
off again. Thus the effect can be either
on or off, no half measures here I'm
afraid.
So, if we had selected the sawtooth
waveform f o r  v oic e thr ee a n d  a
triangle one for  voice one, and we
wanted t o  modulate voice one with
respect to voice three we could either
POKE V+4.21 or , to be on the sale
side, POKE V+4.PEEK(V+4) or 4.-1n
this later  option whatever was set
would remain set, and bit two would
now be turned on as well. By playing a
note we could now see the effects of
ring modulation on voices one and
three.
It works in the same way for any of
the other voices. so that attempting to
modulate voice two with respect to
C64 PROGRAMMING
voice three would require us to POKE
V+ILPEEK(V+11) OR 4. and so on_
Setting ev ery thing t o  a  tr iangle
waveform and modulating all voices
with respect t o  each other  is  the
ultimate in ring modulation, and in the
following example we'll see just what
sort of thing can be achieved. Let's go
back to our Close Encounters theme.
(See foot of page).
Almost the same as before, but this
time we're using the ring modulation
effect and setting all the voices to be
triangular waveforms. This is achieved
by POK Ling a 21 into all the waveform
registers in line 25. As before, line 35
halts proceedings until the space bar is
pressed, whereupon the program hops
off back to line 25 to get another note.
With iust this minor change. vou can
see h o w  dramatically different the
effect can be.
You might now  care t o  amend
some o f  the earlier programs t o
incorporate this  effect. so that ( for
example) we could he playing notes in
different o c t a v e s  a n d  h a v i n g
knerything modulated with respect to
everything else, or we could be playing
chords, so that the three different notes
in t h e  c hord ar e again a ll being
modulated w i t h  eac h other . T h e
difference i n  sound is  really quite
suprising.
At the moment, we can only really
use this ring modulation as a novelty
item, and w e can't in  a ll honesty.
produce am thing startmgly useful.
Synchronisation is  another great
weapon a t  o u r  disposal. a n d  b y
combining the two effects we can begin
to make great progress.

produced b y  'electronic' composers
such as Jean Michaeklarre. or groups
like Tangerine Dream, is  synchro-
nisation. That is, you set up one voice to
play a straightforward musical tune,
like the 'riff t o  be found in Tubular
Bells, f o r  example (which we'll be
looking at in  a moment), and then
synchronise the voice playing that riff
with another voice. Then, while the
one voice merrily carries on playing its
little tune to itself over and over again
the composer or group can simply play
with the other voice, in the conﬁdent
knowledge that the 'r iff
attempt t o  follow it, or synchronise
with it.
To put it another way, voice three
might be playing its tune in the key of
C. while voice one is being made to
play notes. C, F. C. G, F and back to C
again. This is the simple 12 bar boogie
stuff that has made vast fortunes for a
number of' different groups over the
years. The Ulric in C then tries to lol low
this sequence of C. E, C. G. F and back
to C again, the results being anything
from wonderfully musical t o  truly
cacophonous. T h e  s k i l l  ' o f  t h e
musician is  t o increase the level of
wonderful and decrease the level of
cacophony. O ur  task is to make the
thing happen in the ﬁrst place, and
worry about the noise afterwards.
Combining synchronisation w ith
ring modulation can produce some
quite surprising results, but we'll leave
that one f o r  now  and concentrate
solely o n  synchronisation. As  with
ring modulation, we'll take a look at
the rules of the game ﬁrst.
Some Rules
There aren't any -  thank goodness!
What this feature tries to do is match
the fundamental frequency of the note
being played by  one voice with the
fUndamental frequency of a note being
played by another. Thus, if we were to
synchronise voices one and three,
voice three c ould b e  playing our
Tubular Bells r iff mentioned earlier,
and then by altering the frequency of
the notes being produced by voice one
we could make voice three try and
follow it around.
Note t h a t  i t  i s  o n l y  t h e
fundamental frequencies t h a t  are
affected here: the rest try and carry one
as if absolutely nothing has happened.
This has the effect of producing what
can sound like three voices from just
two, as one set of frequencies carries

on as before, the fundamental one tries
to follow the other voice, while that
other voice is also playing a tune, or
series of notes, all of its own.
Since i t  i s  thes e fundemantal
frequencies that are being matched,
the only rule that we must obey is the
frequencies of the notes being played
by voice three (assuming synchronis-
ation is between voices one and three)
must be lower, or equal to, those being
played by  voice one, otherwise not
very much happens. You can try using
higher frequencies i f  you lik e, and
indeed you are encouraged to do so
since, as we've seen, the only way of
getting the best out of the SID chip is
to mess a b o u t  w i t h  t h e  c ontr ol
registers a n d  s ee w h a t  happens.
However, theory must as usual come
before practice, so let's take a look at
the registers b e in g  affec ted b y
synchronisation
Bits of Information
We saw with ring modulation that the
registers in question were those used to
determine the waveform of the three
voices, and that those registers were
multi-purpose ones. Hazard a  w ild
guess as to what the third function of
those registers is? Yes, hard to believe
isn't it, as well as controlling waveform
and ring modulation they also look
after synchronisation.
This actually makes quite a bit of
sense from the point o f  view of the
designers of the chip, since synchron-
isation, lik e r in g  modulation, c an
either be on or off, and only one bit is
required to do that. There are only
four waveforms that can be selected,
so four bits are needed, and those
waveforms can be either on or  off,
r equir ing o n e  f u r t h e r  b i t .
Consequently, there is even a spare bit
left over to do nothing redundancy,
and a criminal waste. Let's look at the
chip to see precisely what it  is that
we're going to be altering.
128 064 032 ()16 008 004 002 001
007 006 005 004 003 002 001 000
001 001 011 001 WO 002 003 001
The bit to keep an eye out for this
time is bit one, labelled three in the
bottom line of information, since it is
the third part of this register that we're
going to be looking at. Rather like ring
modulation, synchronisation can be
either on or off, and each of the three
registers works in exactly the same
way.
C64 PROGRAMMING
To turn it on, we need to alter bit
one by (assuming our base of V=54272
and altering just the only voice) POKE
V+4PEEK(V+4) O R  2 .  Therefore
only this ﬁrst bit is altered, leaving
everything else as it  was before we
came along. Since, for the purpose of
our example program w e want t o
synchronise voice one with respect to
voice three, this will be ﬁne. Voice
three can carry on in its own sweet
way, with no great interference from
us. Let us ﬁrst of all set up the start of
the program in our usual way.
5 FO R 1=0 T O  24:POK 54272+1,
0:N EXT
10 V=54272
15 POKE V+24,I5
20 POKE V+5,9:POKE V-1-6,240
21 POKE V+12,9:POKE V-1-13,240
22 POKE V
25 FOR 1=0 TO 2:POKE
POKE V+1s7+4 (2 t 1•16+3):NEXT I
This sets up our three voices to
have different waveforms, and to be
synchronised with each other. This, of
course, i s  impossible. a s  Es c her
musicals involves everything playing
at a lower note than everything else
which just cannot be achieved, but at
least it will make a suitable noise and
you'll be able to listen to the results!
Now we need the data for  the
Tubular Bells riff, and as any fans of
Mike Oldﬁeld will know the notes we
need are D, E, C, D, F, G, E, F, E
before going back to the start again.
Fortunately for us the delays between
the notes  being played ar e quite
straightforward, c ons is ting o f  a
standard delay of whatever length we
choose and a half of that delay.
So, our data statement becomes:
100 D AT A 2463,10,2195,10,2463,10,
2930,10
101 D A T A  3288,10,2765,10,2930,10,
2765,10,0,0
The next line of our program can
now be used to read this in and set up
the h i g h  v a lu e  a n d  l o w  v a lu e
frequencies.

I t h in k  y ou'll agree, t h a t  this
produces quite an unusual effect.
You might now care to try your
hand at introducing chords, or notes
being played at different octaves, and
see what the results of that might be.
We c a n n o t  y e t  g e t  o n t o  t r u e
synchronisation, because w e would
need a n  inner  knowledge o f  h o w
musical interrupts work and how we
can combine those interrupts with a
synthesiser program.
And before we can do that, we also
need t o  k now something about the
workings of the last major feature of
the S W  c hip, namely the ﬁltering
techniques. I f  y o u  t h i n k  r i n g
modulation and synchronisation were
using multi-purpose registers, well, in
the w or ds  o f  someone relatively
famous, You Ain't Seen Nothing' Yet!
Filtering
A muc h misunderstood and, as  a
consequence, must underused aspect
of t h e  C ommodor e 6 4 ' s  mu s ic
capabilities is  the idea o f  ﬁltering.
People who have managed to master
this aspect o f  things have produced
some wonderful sound programs over
the years, whether as simple effects for
games or background soundtracks of
seemingly limitles s  dur ation a n d
soaring or iginality , a n d  y o u  c a n
guarantee that every successful music
package sold for the Commodore 64
has had, at its heart, a deep working
knowledge o f  ﬁltering and how  i t
works.
On the Commodore 64 we have
four differ ent ty pes  o f  ﬁlter ing
available to us. All work on the same
principle, but adapt that principle for
different needs, depending on the type
of ﬁlt e r in g  s elec ted. O n e  c a n
independently ﬁlter any or all of the
three voices, b u t  once ﬁltering has
been selected than any voices which
are being ﬁltered are all subject to the
same type of ﬁltering, and the same
effects of selecting that type are also
common t o  a ll the voices. This  is
similar t o  t h e  v o lu me  c ontr ol,
although a s  w i t h  t h a t  partic ular
option, things can be programmed in
such a way as to seemingly get around
that limitation.
As with a number of other control
registers on the SID chip. ﬁltering is
achieved by using two-multi-purpose
registers, and one of these is the afore-
mentioned volume control -  register
V+24, if we assume, as usual, our base
location is 54272 and the variable V to

beset equal to that value. Therefore we
must do away with our long held belief
of simply POKEing V+24.15 to turn
the v olume o n  t o  max imum, and
POK Ein V+2 4 , 0  t o  t u r n  i t  o f f
altogether. As we shall see. POKEing
that particular register affects far more
than just the volume.
But ﬁrst, let's look  at the four
different types of ﬁltering.
High Pass Filter
128 064 032 016 008 004 002 001

As w it h  a l l  t h e  other  types, this
particular effect depends on a selected
frequency, whic h is  k nown as  the
cutoff frequency. We  shall see how
that is selected in a moment. Having
determined the cutoff frequency, then,
selecting a high pass ﬁlter ensures that
the level o f  frequencies below the
cutoff point are drastically reduced,
while all those equal to it or higher
than it are passed through as normal.
Therefore a note of frequency 1000
cycles per second, or hertz, coupled
with a high pass ﬁlter and a cutoff
frequency of 1100 hertz, would sound
rather quiet! A l l  frequencies below
1100 hertz would be reduced, and thus
the note itself would be reduced into
relative silence. Selecting a cutoff of
about 900 hertz would, on the other
hand, produce something. N o  note
consists o f  just a  simple frequency,
since a l l  t h e  waveforms (triangle,
sawtooth, pulse and noise) produce a
variety o f  harmonics ar ound t h e
desired frequency. Selecting a  ﬁlter
and a cutoff frequency can therefore
be us ed t o  a m p lif y  o r  r educ e
frequencies around a  certain point,
and helps to simulate more accurately
a variety of musical instruments.
A high pass ﬁlter lets everything
through higher than or  equal to the
cutoff frequency, w h ile  reduc ing
everything lower than it.
Lovi, Pass Filter
This, as you might expect, is the exact
opposite o f  t h e  h ig h  pass ﬁlter ,
although i t  operates o n  t h e same
principle and still requires a c utoff
frequency t o  b e  s et. T h is  t ime,
everything low er  t h a n  t h e  c utoff
frequency i s  passed thr ough a s
normal, while everything higher than
it is severely reduced. For example. a
note o f  frequency 1000 hertz when
played through a low pass ﬁlter using a
cutoff frequency of around 1100 hertz
would sound perfectly normal (well,
almost) w hile changing the c utoff
C64 PROGRAMMING
frequency to about 900 hertz would
severely limit the sound.
A lo w  pass ﬁlter, lets through
everything lower than or equal to the
cutoff frequency, w h ile  r educ ing
everything higher than it.
Band Pass Filter
This would be something that would
be useful on a televison, allowing Only
certain groups to be played and getting
rid o f  anything extreme! O n  t h e
Commodore 64, however, a band pass
ﬁlter allows only a narrow band o f
frequencies to be played around the
cutoff frequency, w h ile  rejec ting
everything below or above that hand.
Therefore a note of ,1000 hertz played
through a band pass ﬁlter with a cutoff
frequency of 1000 hertz would sound
less 'full' than normal since all the
usual harmonics have been severely
reduced, leaving just a narrow band of
frequencies to get through.
In other words, a band pass ﬁlter
lets through everything in a band of
frequencies a r o u n d  t h e  c u t o f f
frequency, a n d  reduces everything
either higher or lower than the band.
Notch Reject Filter
The complete opposite of a band pass
ﬁlter, and strictly speaking one that
doesn't exist on the Commodore 64.
However, by  combining the already
mentioned high pass and low  pass
ﬁlters we can produce this fourth extra
ﬁlter. This time, if  we select a notch
reject ﬁlter  a n d  o u r  us ual c utoff
frequency, everything within a narrow
band centering around t h e  c utoff
frequency is rejected, while everything
outside it passed through as normal,
This has the effect of cutting down on
the main 'sound' of a note while only
play ing t h e  ' e x t r e m e '  o f  t h e
frequencies.
To conclude, a notch reject ﬁlter
reduces everything in a narrow band,
or notch, around the cutoff frequency,
while le t t in g  thr ough ev ery thing
outside that notch. H o w  does one
select these various ﬁlters?
Voice and Filter Selection
Let us ﬁrst of all consider the different
types of ﬁlter, and the best way to do
this is by looking at the register V+24.
128 064 032 016 008 004 002 001

Bits zero to three of this register are
used to control the volume, and can be
seen to have the values 0 to 15. Bit four
is used to select a low pass ﬁlter, so
POKE V+24,PEEK(V+24) O R  1 6
turns on a low pass ﬁlter while keeping
the volume at its normal level. Or, if
you like, PO KE V+24,31 sets a low
pass ﬁlter with a maximum volume,
Bit ﬁve is used to select a band pass
ﬁlter, so that POKE V+24,47 can be
used to select that ﬁlter while keeping
the volume at maximum level.
Bit six is used to select a high pass
ﬁlter, so that POKE V+24,79 can be
chosen to switch a high pass ﬁlter on,
switch all the others off, and again
keep the volume at maximum level.
Bit seven is used to turn all the ﬁlters
off, so POKE V+24,143 does precisely
that. but once more keeps the volume
at maximum.
Finally our 'hybrid' ﬁlter is chosen
by combining a high pass with a low
pass ﬁlter for the notch reject ﬁlter, so
to s e t  t h a t  w e  m u s t .  PO KE
V+24,(64+16+15) or POKE V+24,95.
Having turned them on,  which
voice are we going to use and how are
we t o  select the cut o f f  frequency?
There ar e three mor e registers to
consider now, namely V+21, V+22
and V-1-23. We'll look at the latter ﬁrst.
We'll ignore bit three, since that is
used only for an external input, and
we're n o t  a b o u t  t o  t u r n  Your
Commodore into a  maze o f circuit
diagrams.
Quite simply, turning on bit zero
will select voice one to be ﬁltered,
turning on bit one will select voice two
to be ﬁltered, and turning on bit two
will select voice three to be ﬁltered.
Turning on all the bits will select all
three voices to be ﬁltered, and any
combination can be chosen as you see
ﬁt.
Bits four  to seven determine the
ﬁlter resonance, that is, the amount of
resonance that one can expect with
respect to the cut off frequency. Being a
four bit number it can contain any
value between 0 and 32, and rather like
our discussion on ADSR it is easiest to
think o f it this way, multiplying the
value in the range 0 to 32 to ﬁnd out
which value should really be POKEd
in there.

Please allow 28 days for delivery.

ou may  have noticed that our
I/
listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for  a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more.
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f  countless spaces in  PRINT
statements and strings we use a speciW
coding s y s tem. T h e  c o d e ,  o r
mnemonic, is  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example. [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and ISAI01 would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
IS+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-I-2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
ISPC4] o r .  exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated int o English this  means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N .  DO WN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C31 
o
This would be achieved by holding

down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F 3 key and.
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would o f  course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
I SS],[C*]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T ]  will
appear jn  a  listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
Out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press t h e  number  n in e  k e y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T 's  and then h o ld  down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f  these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this ma
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE april 1988
g
: C C = 2 '
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check

Bug Finder
We'd like to remind our readers that
we run a Bug Finder service.
If you have typed in one of our
programs and despite much checking.
you still can't get it to run. then send us
the following:
Two copies of your program on tape
or disk.
A description of your problem.
If possible a listing of your work (you
max omit this).
A stamped. self-addressed envelope
for return of the program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where you
have made errors and place a corrected
copy of the program back on to 'our
tape or disk before we return it to you.
Do not send a program to us as
soon as it stops working. please check
it several times ﬁrst.
We d o  get a  large number o f
queries and so it may take a while for
us to deal with yours personally.
Note: we can only deal with problems
relating to programs published in Your
Commodore.

Reproduced here y ou w ill ﬁnd the

We suggest that y ou write this
correct address in the front o f  your

At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we receive hundreds of letters from readers every
month. We do try and answer each individually but sometimes this is impossible
due to pressure of work. If you have written to us and not received a personal
reply, we apologise for this but we cannot promise to reply to every item of mail
we receive. If you feel that your question or letter really needs an answer, then
inclusion of an s.a.e. will guarantee a reply, although this may still take time to
arrive.
