§4-2 Vagueness: One Option—Revising Our Logic
Greg Restall

Resolving the Problem
r1, r1 ⊃r2, r2 ⊃r3, . . . , r9,999 ⊃r10,000 ⊢r10,000
▶The premises seem true.
▶The argument seems valid,
▶The conclusion seems false.

Resolving the Problem
r1, r1 ⊃r2, r2 ⊃r3, . . . , r9,999 ⊃r10,000 ⊢r10,000
▶The premises seem true.
▶The argument seems valid, but it isn’t.
▶The conclusion seems false.

Option 2
1. Logic does not apply to vague expressions.
2. Logic does apply, and the argument is not valid.
3. Logic does apply, the argument is valid but one of the
premises is false.
4. Logic does apply, the argument is valid and sound,
and therefore the conclusion is true.

Degrees of Truth

Conditionals and Truth Degrees

Conditionals and Truth Degrees
▶If i(A) ⩽i(B) then i(A ⊃B) = 1

Conditionals and Truth Degrees
▶If i(A) ⩽i(B) then i(A ⊃B) = 1
▶If i(A) > i(B) then i(A ⊃B) = 1 −i(A) + i(B)

For you to try
Here are three circles,
numbered 1, 2, 3.
Let ri be the statement:
circle i is red,
and let li be the
statement: circle i is large.
Let’s suppose
i(l1) = i(r3) = 1,
i(l2) = i(r2) = 1
2
and
i(l3) = i(r1) = 0.
Which of the
following
statements are
true?
▶i(r2 ⊃r3) = 1
▶i(r2 ⊃r3) = 1
2
▶i(r2 ⊃r3) = 0
▶i(r2 ⊃l2) = 1
▶i(r2 ⊃l2) = 1
2
▶i(r2 ⊃l2) = 0

When is an Argument Valid?
▶An argument from Σ to B is t-valid iﬀ
whenever i(A) ⩾t for each A in Σ then i(B) ⩾t too.
- Think of t as the threshold to count as true.

- Think of t as the threshold to count as true.
▶If the argument from Σ to A is t-valid we’ll write ‘Σ ⊨t A.’
