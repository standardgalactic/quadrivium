Sets
●
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. A set is not a sequence type in 
Python.
●
Elements cannot be accessed by index;
●
A set is a mutable object and that means it can be modified. There is also another object 
type called FrozenSet that is immutable. A set can contain as elements any type of 
immutable object. 
 
●
A set uses curly braces and commas to separate its elements.  
>>> s1 = {1, 4.5, 'abc'}
>>> s1
{1, 4.5, 'abc'}
●
You cannot access items in a set by index because there is no order.
 
 
>>> s1[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#33>", line 1, in <module>
s1[0]
TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing
