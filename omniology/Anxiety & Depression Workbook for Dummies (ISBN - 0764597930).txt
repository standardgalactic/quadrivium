Foreword
N
ot long ago I wrote the following foreword for the book, Depression For Dummies.
As the current Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies is a companion to that
book as well as Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies, I believe the previous foreword is both
germane and worth repeating, followed by some specific comments about the current work. 
“I am very pleased that Drs. Charles Elliott and Laura Smith have reviewed
and distilled the scientific literature on the treatment of depression for the
general public. This book is uniquely comprehensive in that it thoroughly
covers the scientifically validated treatments for depression, including behav-
ior therapy, medications, interpersonal therapy, and cognitive therapy. The
authors have also included promising ideas based on mindfulness and posi-
tive psychology. However, they have chosen to emphasize the importance of
cognitive therapy because no other therapy has received as much support as
cognitive therapy for the treatment of depression.
Thus, Drs. Elliott and Smith have woven important cognitive therapy princi-
ples into their presentation of the other validated approaches to depression.
This decision is appropriate since research has suggested that some of these
other therapies may in fact work due in part to the cognitive therapy strate-
gies embedded within them.
I believe a word about cognitive therapy is in order. In the late 1950s, I began
developing cognitive therapy. At the time, I was dissatisfied with the lack of
evidence supporting the value of the prevailing psychotherapy — Freudian
psychoanalysis — in treating depression. Cognitive therapy quickly became
established as a highly effective treatment for depression, a finding that 
has been verified in numerous subsequent clinical trials. Over the ensuing
decades, cognitive therapy has also demonstrated excellent outcomes in the
treatment of problems with anger, anxiety, panic disorder, stress, relationship
problems, substance abuse, eating disorders, and most recently, even schizo-
phrenia. To date, no other psychotherapy has demonstrated such consistent
effectiveness across a broad swath of problems. Depression For Dummies
does a marvelous job of providing readers with the core techniques and prin-
ciples of cognitive therapy as applied to depression.
I feel it’s important to note that Depression For Dummies is not a book for
dummies! Rather, this book lays out the principles of cognitive therapy, as
well as other validated psychotherapies, in exceptionally clear terms. Drs.
Elliott and Smith include fascinating clinical examples and effective exercises
within the most reader-friendly, entertaining format I’ve seen in a book of this
genre. I have no doubt it will prove to be a powerful self-help resource as well
as an adjunct to psychotherapy.
I have known Dr. Elliott since the early 1980s, when he was a highly skillful
cognitive therapist serving in a major psychotherapy outcome study. I recall
last encountering Drs. Elliott and Smith just a few years ago at an interna-
tional conference on cognitive therapy in Catania, Italy. They presented at
this conference as part of their honeymoon. Such dedication to cognitive
therapy!

If you struggle with depression, I strongly recommend Depression For
Dummies. These authors convey considerable compassion, empathy, and
insight in addition to unusual clarity.”
At this time, I am especially pleased to see that Drs. Elliott and Smith have written a compan-
ion workbook called Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies. This workbook gives you
the basic essentials of each therapeutic strategy. After providing the rudimentary under-
standing you need, it quickly shows ways to put that information to work in your own life.
You won’t have to spend hours reading about technical jargon and irrelevant material.
Almost everything in this book can be immediately applied to improving the way you feel,
behave, and think. In addition, the authors have made the process amazingly painless. The
exercises are highly engaging, and Drs. Elliott and Smith weave humor throughout that man-
ages not to demean or condescend. You might just have a good time with this workbook!

Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
D
o you worry too much? Are you often sad or down in the dumps? Do you have to drag
yourself out of bed in the morning? Or maybe you avoid people more than you should.
If so, you’re probably dealing with some type of anxiety or depression. Depression and anxi-
ety are serious problems — they darken vision and distort thinking while draining joy and
pleasure from life.
Everyone feels sad or worried from time to time. Unpleasant feelings are a normal part of
life. But when depression or anxiety interferes with your work, play, and/or relationships,
it’s time to take action.
Good news! You can conquer these problems. And the Anxiety & Depression Workbook For
Dummies will help. You can use this workbook on its own or as a supplement to counseling.
In either case, numerous studies show that self-help efforts work.
Experts estimate that almost a quarter of the people in the world will experience signiﬁcant
problems with anxiety at some point in their lives. And between 15 and 20 percent will suc-
cumb to the ravages of depression at one point or another. Unfortunately, many people
suffer from both of these maladies. Over the years, we’ve known many clients, friends, and
family members who have anguished over anxiety or depression, but most of them have
found signiﬁcant relief.
So if you struggle with anxiety, depression, or both, you’re not alone. We join you in your
battle by giving you research-based strategies and plenty of practice opportunities to help
you defeat depression and overcome anxiety.
About This Book
Our purpose in writing this book is to give you a wide range of skills and tools for managing
anxiety and depression. Although we touch on essential concepts about depression and
anxiety, this book is action-oriented — in other words, you have the opportunity to actively
apply our professional ideas to your life in meaningful ways.
No doubt you used workbooks in school. A math workbook may have helped you apply
math concepts to everyday problems. Or a reading workbook may have improved your abil-
ity to comprehend stories. Today, you can ﬁnd workbooks on almost any topic, from selling
your home and succeeding on tests to preparing your taxes and improving your memory.
The purpose of any workbook is to lay out the basics of a topic and then provide numerous
opportunities to apply and practice the concepts at hand. Typically, books explain issues, and
workbooks help you master new skills. In other words, the Anxiety & Depression Workbook For
Dummies is “less talk — more action.”
Did you notice the “work” part of workbook? Don’t put this book back on the shelf quite yet!
You’ll be well paid for your work in the form of increased life satisfaction and reduced emo-
tional distress. And the work is actually rather interesting because you discover new ways
to live your life and get what you want.

A Note to Our Depressed and Anxious Readers
Feeling depressed or anxious certainly isn’t funny. In fact, when you’re feeling this way, 
you may ﬁnd it quite difﬁcult to see the humor in anything. Nevertheless, we’ve chosen to
include a little humor throughout this workbook. We understand that you may be offended
that we appear to make light of what is a dark, difﬁcult subject, but humor is an important
coping tool. Our intention is to cheer you up a bit.
How to Use This Book
Unlike most workbooks, you don’t necessarily have to read and use the chapters of this
book in order, beginning to end. You can pick and choose what chapters to read and what
exercises to do, and you can also choose where to start and stop. We give you just enough
information to carry out the exercises and improve your moods.
This book is meant to be written in. Writing enhances skills and commits you to taking
action, so we strongly encourage you to do the work required for your recovery by writing
out your answers in the forms and worksheets. Don’t worry about your handwriting or
spelling — nobody’s grading your work.
Throughout this book, you’ll see sections labeled My Reﬂections. When you come across 
a reﬂection space, we recommend that you take a little time to ponder what you’re feeling,
what you’ve discovered, and/or any new insights you’ve achieved. But hey, this is your
workbook — write down anything you want in My Reﬂections.
What Not to Read
Workbooks may conjure up memories of boredom and drudgery for you. Do you recall end-
less hours of mindless homework? Your teacher probably told you to ﬁll out every single
page of each and every assignment, whether you’d mastered the skills or not.
Not in this book! We don’t tell you what you have to do. You can pick and choose which sec-
tions to read and which exercises to complete. Although we believe all our suggestions have
value, we encourage you to judge for yourself which exercises offer maximum beneﬁt to you.
What We Assume About You
By the sheer fact that you’ve picked up this book, we assume, perhaps foolishly, that you
want to do something about depression and/or anxiety. We hope you already know a little
about these topics, but if you want to know more, we suggest you read either or both of 
the companion books to this workbook: Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies (Wiley) and
Depression For Dummies (Wiley). Of course, we’re slightly biased toward these books
because we wrote them, but honestly, they’ll broaden your understanding of working
through emotional distress.

Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
The Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies is organized into seven parts, which we
outline in the following sections.
Part I: Analyzing Angst and Preparing a Plan
This part is all about helping you identify your problem and take the ﬁrst small steps
toward recovery. Chapter 1 helps you discover whether you have a problem with anxiety or
depression. The quizzes in this chapter help you see where these problems show up in your
world and what they do to your thoughts, behaviors, feelings, and relationships. In Chapter 2,
you go on a journey to the origins of your problems with anxiety and depression because
knowing where it all began helps you realize that you’re not to blame. Because change some-
times feels overwhelming, Chapter 3 addresses self-sabotage and helps you keep moving
forward. Chapter 4 provides you with ways for keeping track of your moods and becoming
more aware of your thoughts.
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy
The chapters in this part help you become a thought detective. In Chapter 5, you ﬁnd out
how to examine your thoughts for distortions; then, in Chapter 6, you prosecute those dis-
torted thoughts and rehabilitate them.
Chapter 7 shows you how certain core beliefs darken and distort your view of yourself, your
world, and your future as surely as eyeglasses with the wrong prescription muddle normal
sight. We include tools for regrinding your life-lenses so you see things more clearly. Finally,
in Chapter 8, you have the opportunity to practice mindfulness and acceptance — more
techniques for handling troubling thoughts.
Part III: Actions Against Angst: Behavior Therapy
Chapter 9 spells out how you take direct action against the natural tendency to avoid what
makes you depressed or anxious. In Chapter 10, we get you up and moving by providing
workbook-type exercises that encourage physical exercise. When you’re depressed or anx-
ious, few activities sound like fun, so Chapter 11 has worksheets for reintroducing pleasure
into your life. Finally, Chapter 12 helps you tackle life problems that grow out of your emo-
tional distress.
Part IV: Phocus on Physical Pheelings
Addressing the physical side of distress is as important as addressing the mental or emo-
tional side. Excessive stress associated with anxiety and depression produces hormones
that ravage the body by increasing blood pressure and contributing to stomach problems,
weight gain, and heart disease. Therefore, relaxation techniques play an important role in
alleviating anxiety and depression. In Chapter 13, you ﬁnd a variety of exercises for reducing
tension and stress. Because medication is an additional option for many people who are
depressed or anxious, Chapter 14 guides you through the decision of whether or not med-
ications are the right choice for you.

Introduction

Part V: Relationship Therapy
Depression and anxiety can spill over and contaminate your relationships like sewage
dumped into a river. Good relationships offer support in dealing with emotional distress,
whereas spoiled relationships just make things worse. Chapter 15 helps you ﬁgure out if
your relationships are suffering, and the worksheets and exercises in Chapter 16 guide you
in improving the quality of your relationships.
Part VI: Looking Beyond Anxiety and Depression
After people overcome their anxiety and depression, naturally they prefer to go on with
their lives as though they’d never had a problem. Unfortunately, like the ﬂu, you can catch
depression or anxiety more than once. Chapter 17 tells you how to prepare for and deal
with any setbacks in your condition, and Chapter 18 helps you develop positive habits that
lead to a more joyful, meaningful, and connected life.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
This part contains a couple of our top ten lists when it comes to the subject of anxiety and
depression. Chapter 19 recommends ten resources for getting help in dealing with your
depression and anxiety. If you’re looking for a quick way out of a bad mood, Chapter 20 is
for you — it lists ten remedies that don’t take a whole lot of effort.
Characters in This Book
Throughout this workbook, we use ﬁctional characters to illustrate how you can complete
the various worksheets and exercises. Although these characters aren’t real people, they
represent composites of various clients and others we’ve known and worked with over the
years. Any resemblance to an actual individual, whether alive or deceased, is unintended
and coincidental. Nonetheless, we believe you’ll ﬁnd yourself relating to these characters
and ﬁnd their experiences useful.

In this part . . .

e help you figure out how anxiety or depression
affects your thinking, behaving, feeling, and bodily
sensations. You discover how your problems began and
work toward accepting that you’re not to blame for having
them. In case you feel stuck or unable to move forward,
we give you strategies for overcoming obstacles. Finally,
you see how to keep track of both your moods and the
thoughts that accompany distressing feelings.

Chapter 1
Sorting Out Signs of Anxiety 
and Depression
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how depression and anxiety affect you
 Finding your personal starting point
 Knowing when to get more help
E
veryone feels sad or worried from time to time. Such emotions are both natural and
unavoidable. People worry about their children, bills, aging parents, jobs, and health.
And most people have shed a tear or two watching a sad movie or a news story about a
poignant tragedy. That’s normal. A little bit of anxiety and depression is part of everyday
life.
But when sadness ﬁlls most of your days or worries saturate your mind, that’s not so
normal. You may be experiencing a real problem with depression or anxiety. Anxiety and
depression can affect how you think, behave, feel, and relate to others. The discussion and
quizzes in this chapter help you ﬁgure out how depression and anxiety affect your life.
When you understand what’s going on, you can start doing something about it.
Don’t freak out if the quizzes in this chapter reveal that you have a few symptoms of anxiety
or depression. Most people do. We let you know if you should be concerned.
If your symptoms are numerous and severe or your life seems out of control, you should
consult your primary care physician or a mental health professional. These quizzes aren’t
meant to replace trained mental health professionals — they’re the only people who can
really diagnose your problem.
Dwelling on Dismal and Worried Thoughts
If you were able to listen in on the thoughts that reverberate through a depressed person’s
head, you might hear “I’m a failure,” “My future looks bleak,” “Things just keep on getting
worse,” or “I regret so many things in my life.”
On the other hand, the thoughts of an anxious person might sound like “I’m going to make a
fool out of myself when I give that speech,” “I never know what to say at parties,” “The free-
way scares me to death,” “I know that the odds of a plane crash are small, but ﬂying scares
me,” or “I’m going have a nervous breakdown if my editor doesn’t like what I write.”

Thoughts inﬂuence the way you feel. The very darkest thoughts usually lead to depression,
whereas anxiety usually stems from thoughts about being judged or hurt. And, of course,
people often have both types of thoughts.
Do your thoughts dwell on the dark, dismal, or the scary aspects of life? Take the quiz in
Worksheet 1-1 to determine if your thoughts reﬂect a problem with anxiety or depression.
Put a check mark next to an item if you feel the statement applies to you.
Worksheet 1-1
The Negative Thinking Quiz
❏
1. Things are getting worse and worse for me.
❏
2. I worry all the time.
❏
3. I think I’m worthless.
❏
4. I never know what to say.
❏
5. No one would miss me if I were dead.
❏
6. I’m afraid that I’ll get sick.
❏
7. I think I’m a failure.
❏
8. My thoughts race, and I obsess about things.
❏
9. I don’t look forward to much of anything.
❏10. I get really nervous around people I don’t know.
❏11. The world would be better off without me.
❏12. Thoughts about past trauma keep rolling through my mind.
❏13. I ﬁnd it impossible to make decisions.
❏14. I can’t stand it when I’m the center of attention.
❏15. My life is full of regrets.
❏16. I can’t stand making mistakes.
❏17. I don’t see things getting any better in the future.
❏18. I worry about my health all the time.
❏19. I’m deeply ashamed of myself.
❏20. I over-prepare for everything.
Although these thoughts can occur to someone who’s either depressed or anxious (or both),
the odd-numbered items are most indicative of depression, and the even-numbered items
reﬂect anxious thinking. There’s no pass or fail mark on this quiz. However, the more items
you endorse, the more you have cause for concern; speciﬁcally, if you check more than
eight or ten items, you should think seriously about addressing your condition. At the same
time, if you very strongly believe in any of these items, you just may have too much anxiety
or depression.
If you have any thoughts of suicide or utter hopelessness, you should consult your primary
care physician or a mental health professional immediately.

Part I: Analyzing Angst and Preparing a Plan 

Walking in Quicksand: Apprehensive 
and Blue Behavior
If you were to follow a depressed or anxious person around, you might see some behavioral
signs of their emotional turmoil. That’s because depression and anxiety on the inside affect
what people do on the outside. For example, a depressed person may look tired, move
slowly, or withdraw from friends and family; an anxious person may avoid socializing or
have a trembling voice.
Take the quiz in Worksheet 1-2 to see if your behavior indicates a problem with anxiety
and/or depression. Check off each statement that applies to you.
Worksheet 1-2
The Distraught Behavior Quiz
❏
1. I’ve been crying for no clear reason.
❏
2. I pace around when I’m worried.
❏
3. Sometimes I can’t make myself get out of bed.
❏
4. I avoid going into crowded areas.
❏
5. I can’t seem to make myself exercise.
❏
6. I avoid risks because I’m afraid of failure.
❏
7. I don’t do things for fun lately.
❏
8. I always play things on the safe side.
❏
9. I’ve been missing work lately because I just don’t have the motivation.
❏10. I’m really ﬁdgety.
❏11. I’ve been doing everything at a much slower pace for no good reason.
❏12. I avoid people or places that remind me of a bad past experience.
❏13. I don’t care what I look like anymore.
❏14. I spend too much time making sure I look okay.
❏15. I don’t laugh anymore.
❏16. My hands shake when I’m nervous.
❏17. I’ve been letting things go that I need to attend to.
❏18. I feel compelled to repeat actions (such as hand washing, checking locks, arrang-
ing things in a certain way, and so on).
Again, there’s no pass or fail on this quiz. The more items you check, the greater the prob-
lem. Even-numbered items are most consistent with anxiety, and odd-numbered items
largely indicate depression. And, of course, like many people, you may have symptoms of
both types of problems.
Feeling Funky
Depression and anxiety inevitably produce physical symptoms. In fact, some people primar-
ily suffer from changes in appetite, sleep, energy, or pain while reporting few problematic
thoughts or behaviors. These symptoms directly affect your body, but they’re not as easily
observed by other people as the behavioral signs covered in the preceding section.

Chapter 1: Sorting Out Signs of Anxiety and Depression

Take The Sad, Stressed Sensations Quiz in Worksheet 1-3 to see if your body is trying to tell
you something about your emotional state.
Worksheet 1-3
The Sad, Stressed Sensations Quiz
❏
1. I have no appetite.
❏
2. My palms sweat all the time.
❏
3. I wake up too early each morning and can’t go back to sleep.
❏
4. I’ve been experiencing a lot of nausea and diarrhea.
❏
5. I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual.
❏
6. I feel shaky all over.
❏
7. I’ve been having lots of aches and pains for no good reason.
❏
8. When I’m nervous, my chest feels tight.
❏
9. I have no energy lately.
❏10. My heart races when I’m tense.
❏11. I’ve been constipated a lot more often than usual.
❏12. I feel like I can’t catch my breath.
❏13. I’m eating all the time lately.
❏14. My hands are often cold and clammy.
❏15. I’ve lost my sex drive.
❏16. Sometimes I hyperventilate.
❏17. Every move I make takes more effort lately.
❏18. I get dizzy easily.
The symptoms in this quiz can also result from various physical illnesses, drugs in your
medicine cabinet, or even your three-cup coffee ﬁx in the morning. Be sure to consult your
primary care physician if you’re experiencing any of the symptoms in The Sad, Stressed
Sensations Quiz. It’s always a good idea to have a checkup once a year and more frequently
if you experience noticeable changes in your body.
Although physical sensations overlap in anxiety and depression, even-numbered items in
the quiz above are most consistent with anxiety, and the odd-numbered items usually
plague those with depression. There’s no cutoff point for indicating a problem. The more
statements you check off, though, the worse your problem.
Reflecting upon Relationships
When you’re feeling down or distressed for any length of time, odds are that your relation-
ships with those around you will take a hit. Although you may think that your depression 
or anxiety affects only you, it impacts your friends, family, lovers, co-workers, and 
acquaintances.
Take the quiz in Worksheet 1-4 to see if your emotions are causing trouble with your rela-
tionships. Check off any statements that apply to you.
12
Part I: Analyzing Angst and Preparing a Plan 

Worksheet 1-4
The Conﬂicted Connections Quiz
❏
1. I don’t feel like being with anybody.
❏
2. I get very nervous when I meet new people.
❏
3. I don’t feel like talking to anyone.
❏
4. I’m overly sensitive when anyone criticizes me in the slightest way.
❏
5. I’m more irritable with others than usual.
❏
6. I worry about saying the wrong thing.
❏
7. I don’t feel connected to anyone.
❏
8. I worry about people leaving me.
❏
9. I don’t feel like going out with anyone anymore.
❏10. I’m plagued by visions of people I care about getting hurt.
❏11. I’ve withdrawn from everyone.
❏12. I feel uptight in crowds, so I stay at home.
❏13. I feel numb around people.
❏14. I always feel uncomfortable in the spotlight.
❏15. I feel unworthy of friendship and love.
❏16. Compliments make me feel uneasy.
You guessed it; there’s no cutoff score here to tell you deﬁnitively whether or not you’re
anxious or depressed. But the more items you check off, the more your relationships are
suffering from your anxiety, depression, or both. Odd-numbered items usually indicate prob-
lems with depression, and even-numbered items particularly accompany anxious feelings.
Many people are a little shy or introverted. You may feel somewhat anxious meeting new
people and may be uncomfortable in the spotlight — these feelings aren’t necessarily any-
thing to be concerned about. However, such issues become problematic when you ﬁnd
yourself avoiding social activities or meeting new people because of your shyness.
Plotting Your Personal Problems Profile
The Personal Problems Proﬁle provides you with an overview of your problematic symp-
toms. (If you skipped the quizzes in the previous sections of this chapter, go back and take
some time to complete them; your answers to those quizzes come into play in this exercise.)
The proﬁle exercise in this section helps you identify the ways in which anxiety and depres-
sion affect you. One good thing about this proﬁle is that you can track how these symptoms
change as you progress through the rest of this book.
Tyler, a middle-aged engineer, doesn’t consider himself depressed or plagued with any 
emotional problems. But when he sees his primary care doctor, Tyler complains of fatigue,
recent weight gain, and a noticeable loss in his sex drive. After ruling out physical causes,
the doctor suggests that he may be depressed. “Funny,” Tyler says, “my girlfriend just
bought me the Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies and said she thought I was
depressed too. Maybe I’ll take a look at it.”
13
Chapter 1: Sorting Out Signs of Anxiety and Depression

When Tyler ﬁlls out his Personal Problems Proﬁle (see Worksheet 1-5), he lists the following
top ten symptoms and notes whether they indicate anxiety or depression (A or D).
Worksheet 1-5
Tyler’s Personal Problems Proﬁle
1. I have no energy lately. (D)
2. Every move I make takes more effort lately. (D)
3. I’ve lost my sex drive. (D)
4. I’ve been eating all the time lately. (D)
5. I don’t feel like being with anyone. (D)
6. I don’t look forward to much of anything. (D)
7. I ﬁnd it impossible to make decisions. (D)
8. I worry about my health all the time. (A)
9. I feel shaky all over. (A)
10. Sometimes I can’t make myself get out of bed. (D)
As you can see, Tyler suffers primarily from symptoms of depression. And most of these
symptoms are physical in nature. Filling out his Personal Problems Proﬁle helps Tyler see
that he has a depression that he wasn’t even consciously aware of. He reﬂects on his discov-
ery (see Worksheet 1-6).
Worksheet 1-6
Tyler’s Reﬂections
I can see that I do have signs of depression. I didn’t realize that before. And I
see that depression particularly shows up in my body. It’s affecting my energy,
sex drive, and appetite. It’s also making me withdraw from my girlfriend, which I
can see from my loss of sex drive and lack of desire to be with her. Apparently,
I also have a few symptoms of anxiety, and I think I always have. It’s time to do
something about this. 
This is the Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies. You can’t feel better without
doing a little work. It isn’t that difﬁcult. Of course, you can skip a few exercises, but the
more you do, the sooner you’ll start feeling better. Odd as it may seem, writing things down
does a world of good. Writing helps you remember, clariﬁes your thinking, and increases
focus and reﬂection.
Now, complete your own Personal Problems Proﬁle in Worksheet 1-7. Look back at the
quizzes earlier in this chapter and underline the most problematic thoughts, feelings,
behaviors, and relationship issues for you. Then choose up to ten of the most signiﬁcant
items that you’ve underlined and write them in the My Personal Problems Proﬁle space
that’s provided.

In addition, put an A by the symptoms that are most indicative of anxiety (even-numbered
items in the preceding quizzes) and a D by symptoms that are most consistent with depres-
sion (odd-numbered items).

Do your symptoms mostly involve anxiety, depression, or a mix of the two? And do they
seem to mostly affect your thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or relationships? Take some time
to reﬂect on your proﬁle. What conclusions can you draw? Record them in Worksheet 1-8.
Worksheet 1-8

Choosing Your Challenge
The next four parts of this workbook cover the areas of thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and
relationships. One obvious way of deciding which area to begin in is to choose the one that
causes you the most problems. Or, you can work through them in order. Wherever you
choose to start, you should know that all these areas interact with each other. For example,
if you have anxious thoughts about being judged, you’re likely to avoid (behavior) the spot-
light. And you could very well experience butterﬂies (feelings). Furthermore, you may be
overly sensitive to criticism from others (relationships).

Chapter 1: Sorting Out Signs of Anxiety and Depression

Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that many people like to start out by tackling the problem area that
best ﬁts their personal styles. In other words, some folks are doers and others are thinkers;
still others are feelers, and some are relaters. Use the Personal Style Questionnaire in
Worksheet 1-9 to pinpoint and understand your preferred style.
Worksheet 1-9
Personal Style Questionnaire
Thinkers
❏I like facts and numbers.
❏I tend to be a very logical person.
❏I’m a planner.
❏I like to think through problems.
❏I carefully weigh costs and beneﬁts before I act.
Doers
❏I can’t stand sitting around and thinking.
❏I like to take action on problems.
❏I like accomplishing things each day.
❏I like plowing through obstacles.
❏I act ﬁrst and think later.
Feelers
❏I’m a very sensuous person.
❏I pay a lot of attention to how I feel.
❏I love massages and hot baths.
❏Music and art are very important to me.
❏I’m very in touch with my feelings.
Relaters
❏I’m a people person.
❏I’d rather be with people than anything else.
❏I care deeply about other people’s feelings.
❏I’m very empathetic.
❏Relationships are more important to me than accomplishments.
Are you predominately a thinker, doer, feeler, or relater? If you checked considerably more
items in one area than the others, you may want to start your work in the part of this work-
book that corresponds to that style:
 Thinker: Part II, Thought Therapy
 Doer: Part III, Behavior Therapy
 Feeler: Part IV, Physical Feelings
 Relater: Part V, Relationship Therapy

Knowing When to Get More Help
Self-help tools beneﬁt almost everyone who puts in the effort. Many people ﬁnd they can
overcome minor to moderate emotional problems by working with books like this one.
Nevertheless, some difﬁculties require professional help, perhaps because your anxiety or
depression is especially serious or because your problems are simply too complex to be
addressed by self-help methods.
Work through The Serious Symptom Checklist in Worksheet 1-10 to ﬁnd out if you should
seriously consider seeking treatment from a mental health professional.
Checking off any one item from the list means that you should strongly consider a profes-
sional consultation. Furthermore, please realize that no such list can be all-inclusive. If
you’re really not sure if you need help, see a mental health professional for an assessment.
Worksheet 1-10
The Serious Symptom Checklist
❏I have thoughts about killing myself.
❏I feel hopeless.
❏My sleep has been seriously disturbed for more than two weeks (including sleeping too
little or too much).
❏I’ve gained or lost more than a few pounds without trying to do so.
❏I’m ignoring major responsibilities in my life such as going to work or paying bills.
❏I’m hearing voices.
❏I’m seeing things that aren’t there.
❏My drug use and/or drinking are interfering with my life.
❏My thoughts race, and I can’t slow them down.
❏Someone I trust and care about has said I need help.
❏I’ve been getting into numerous ﬁghts or arguments.
❏I’ve been making really poor decisions lately (such as making outlandish purchases or
getting involved in questionable business schemes).
❏Lately I’ve felt that people are out to get me.
❏I haven’t been able to get myself to leave the house except for absolute essentials.
❏I’m taking risks that I never did before.
❏Suddenly I feel like I’m a special person who’s capable of extraordinary things.
❏I’m spending considerably more time everyday than I should repeating actions such as
hand washing, arranging things, and checking and rechecking things (appliances, locks,
and so on).
❏I have highly disturbing ﬂashbacks or nightmares about past trauma that I can’t seem
to forget about.
If you checked one or more of the statements above and you’re beginning to think that per-
haps you need help, where should you go? Many people start with their family physicians,
which is a pretty good idea because your doctor can also determine if your problems have a
physical cause. If physical problems have been ruled out or treated and you still need help,
you can:
17
Chapter 1: Sorting Out Signs of Anxiety and Depression

 Check with your state’s psychology, counseling, social work, or psychiatric association.
 Call your insurance company for recommendations.
 Ask trusted friends or family for recommendations.
 Contact your local university department of psychology, social work, counseling, or
psychiatry for a referral.
Either before or during your ﬁrst session, talk to the mental health professional and ask if
you’ll receive a scientiﬁcally validated treatment for anxiety or depression. Unfortunately,
some practitioners lack necessary training in therapies that have shown effectiveness in sci-
entiﬁc studies. And make sure whomever you see is a licensed mental health practitioner.
At this point, you should pat yourself on the back! Whether this is the ﬁrst chapter you’ve
read or not, you’ve made a good start. Every minute you spend with this workbook is likely
to improve your moods.

Chapter 2
Discovering the Beginnings
In This Chapter
 Burrowing through biology
 Studying your history
 Reviewing what’s happening now
 Finding fault (or not)
I
f you’re reading this book, you probably feel a little anxious or depressed. But you may
not know where those feelings come from. It’s valuable to understand the origins of your
feelings, whether its biology and genetics, personal history, or stress. This chapter helps
you gain insight into the source of your problem and connect the dots, because knowing the
origins of your emotions allows you to discard the baggage of guilt and self-blame.
In this chapter, we review the major causes of depression and anxiety: biology, personal his-
tory, and stress. Many of our clients come to us believing that they’re to blame for having
succumbed to emotional distress. When they discover the factors that contributed to the
origins of their problems, they usually feel less guilty, and getting rid of that guilt frees up
energy that can be used for making important changes.
Building the Body Connection
Feelings can have biological beginnings. Does your Uncle Paul seem down in the dumps? Was
Cousin Jack a neat freak? Was your grandmother a recluse? What was your great-grandmother
like? Why are these questions important? Because depression and anxiety tend to run in fami-
lies. And genes could be responsible for a good portion of your emotional distress.
If you have access to family members, ask if they’d be willing to talk with you about your
family’s history. Ask them if any relatives, from either side of the family, suffered from any
symptoms of anxiety or depression. You may want to review the symptoms covered in
Chapter 1 ﬁrst. There’s no exact number of relatives required for determining if genetics are
responsible for your symptoms. However, the more family members with similar problems,
the more likely you’ve inherited a tendency for depression or anxiety. Fill in the blanks here
with what you learn.

Members of my family with anxiety or depression (brothers, sisters, cousins, parents,
uncles, aunts, and grandparents):
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
In addition to genetics, depression and anxiety can have biological underpinnings in the
drugs you take (legal or illegal) or as the result of physical illness. Drugs — whether over-
the-counter, prescription, or illegal — have many side effects. Sometimes solving your
problem is as simple as checking your medicine cabinet for possible culprits.
Almost any medication you’re taking could inﬂuence your emotions negatively. Check with
your pharmacist or primary care physician to see if your medication may be causing part of
your problem. Don’t stop taking the medication without medical consultation.
In addition, alcohol is widely known to contribute to depression or anxiety when it’s abused.
Some people ﬁnd that even moderate amounts of alcohol exacerbate their problems with
mood. Alcohol also interacts with a wide variety of prescribed and over-the-counter drugs
to produce harmful and even deadly results.
Finally, illegal drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and so
on are taken to alter moods. In the short run, they accomplish that goal; but in the long run,
they almost inevitably worsen mood problems.
Physical illnesses can also produce symptoms of anxiety or depression. Not only can the ill-
ness itself cause mood problems, but worry and grief about illness can contribute to your
distress. If you’ve been diagnosed with a medical condition, check with your doctor to see if
your depression or anxiety is related to that condition.
Laying Out a Lifeline
The sadness and angst you feel today often sprout from seeds planted in your past. There-
fore, exploring your personal history provides clues about the origins of your problems.
The exercise in this section, called the Emotional Origins form, takes a little time.
The Emotional Origins exercise makes you revisit your childhood by asking questions about
your parents and your childhood experiences. Some of the memories involved may evoke
powerful emotions; if you become overwhelmed, you may wish to stop the exercise and
consult a mental health professional for guidance and support.
Filling out this form is a lot easier after you look over an example. So, the following example
shows you how Tyler ﬁlled out his Emotional Origins form.
Tyler suffers from many physical signs of depression such as lack of energy and increased
appetite. He has little insight as to the origins of his depression. His physician refers him to
a psychologist who suggests he ﬁll out an Emotional Origins form (see Worksheet 2-1) to
examine his childhood experiences.

Tyler’s Emotional Origins
Questions About Mother (or other caregiver)
1. What was my mother’s personality like?
She was self-centered and rarely thought much about what my sister and I
needed. When things didn’t go her way, she exploded. She was domineering
and incredibly uptight. She was a perfectionist who talked about the “right way”
or the “wrong way” to do things. I also remember that she always acted like a
martyr.
2. How did my mother discipline me?
She mostly just yelled at us. Sometimes she’d ground us, but we’d talk our way
out of it. I didn’t get in a lot of trouble because she didn’t catch me breaking the
rules.
3. Was my mother warm or cold?
It’s funny; she could be very warm sometimes. But in other ways, it felt like she
couldn’t care less about me.
4. Was she overly critical or supportive?
Again, she was inconsistent. She could be both. Sometimes, she’d encourage
me to do things, and other times, she’d rip me to shreds. I never knew what to
expect.
5. How did she spend time with me?
This seems odd, but I just don’t remember doing much of anything with her. She
was a den mother for my Cub Scout group, though. In retrospect, the things
she did always seemed to be more about her than about me.
6. Were there special circumstances (for example, illness, death, divorce, military 
service, etc.)?
She had a miscarriage when I was about 6 years old. She was really
depressed for several years after that.
7. Does anything else important about her come to mind, whether positive or negative?
She never seemed especially happy or satisﬁed with her life. I remember her
getting furious with my father a number of times.
Questions About Father (or other important caregiver)
1. What was my father’s personality like?
Everybody liked him. He could be very funny. But I can’t say that I really knew
him very well.
21
Chapter 2: Discovering the Beginnings

2. How did my father discipline me?
He mostly stayed out of the discipline area. But sometimes he’d explode over
nothing.
3. Was my father warm or cold?
I guess he was warm, but looking back, it feels like it was pretty superﬁcial. He
never said, “I love you.”
4. Was he overly critical or supportive?
Neither really. He didn’t pay a lot of attention to me. He paid more attention to
my sister than to me. I always felt I wasn’t good enough to warrant his attention.
5. How did he spend time with me?
When I was little, he’d wrestle and roughhouse with me. He worked really long
hours and just wasn’t around that much.
6. Were there special circumstances (for example, illness, death, divorce, military 
service, etc.)?
Nothing really. To the outside world, we seemed like a pretty typical family with
no particular problems.
7. Does anything else important about him come to mind, whether positive or negative?
When he tried to teach me to do things, he’d explode if I didn’t get the hang of it
right away.
Other Questions About Childhood
1. What are my earliest memories?
I don’t remember much from when I was a little kid. My grandfather used to
take us horseback riding. That was fun. I remember my father and my grand-
parents having a big ﬁght over money. That was scary.
2. Did I have siblings or other people in the home who inﬂuenced me, and how?
I looked up to my older sister, but she didn’t want anything to do with me after
she went to junior high school. I think my parents favored her — at least my
Dad did. I never felt like I measured up to her.
3. What do I remember about grade school? (Was I happy; what did I think about
myself; how did I do in school; what were my friendships like; were there any
important events?)
I remember being really shy. But I was a good student. I had a few good friends,
but they were sort of nerds like me.
22
Part I: Analyzing Angst and Preparing a Plan 

4. What do I remember about middle school or junior high school? (Was I happy; what
did I think about myself; how did I do in school; what were my friendships like;
were there any important events?)
I was even shyer then. I felt clumsy and awkward all the time. I didn’t get invited
to parties much. I wasn’t very happy. If I got upset, my mother sometimes would
do some of my homework for me. Then she’d make me feel guilty about it.
5. What do I remember about high school? (Was I happy; what did I think about
myself; how did I do in school; what were my friendships like; were there any
important events?)
I had a few more friends then and started dating some. I got pretty down when
a girl jilted me. I remember staying in my room for hours at a time. I realize now
that I didn’t know how to handle my emotions very well — when I didn’t know
what else to do, I’d just withdraw. I worked just hard enough to get Bs, but I
know I could have done much better in school.
6. What are the major events of my adulthood, such as trauma or winning the lottery?
I graduated from college, got married, and had a couple of kids. My divorce
after 14 years of marriage came as a shock, but I got through it okay.
7. What did this exercise teach me about the origins of my anxiety or depression?
When I think back on my childhood, I realize it wasn’t very happy. My dad didn’t
seem to care much about me. My mother cared more, but she was like an
emotional roller coaster. I just shut down, and I think I’ve had that tendency my
whole life. Maybe I’m shutting down now, too; it’s what I do when I’m unhappy. I
guess I realize that I’m not totally to blame for my problems. It sort of makes
sense that I shut down whenever I face possible rejection, criticism, or when
someone gets angry with me.
After completing the Emotional Origins form, Tyler has a better understanding of why he
copes with stress the way he does. He sees that there’s a reason he shuts down when facing
certain types of situations. The exercise isn’t about blame and faultﬁnding; rather, it helps
Tyler forgive himself for being the way he is. These insights start him on the path toward a
new beginning.
Now, complete your Emotional Origins form in Worksheet 2-2. This is an important exercise;
take as much time as you need. If you happen to be receiving counseling or psychotherapy,
your therapist will no doubt ﬁnd this information useful and informative.
Start by reﬂecting on your childhood. You may jump-start your memory by talking with rela-
tives or by looking through old photo albums. Then move on to answer the questions about
your parents or caregivers as well as the questions about your childhood and adolescence.
Don’t worry about getting all the details right — just do the best you can. Memories aren’t
always completely accurate, but, in a powerful way, they impact the way you feel today.
Please realize that the intent of this exercise is not to place blame on your parents or other
important people in your life. These people indeed may have made signiﬁcant contributions
to your problems, and that’s useful to know. But they came by their own problems as hon-
estly as you did. Understanding helps; blame and faultﬁnding do not.

Surveying Stress
In the search for causes of your anxiety or depression, you need to include a review of 
your world. Open your eyes and observe. What’s going on in your life that aggravates your
distress? From daily trafﬁc hassles to major losses, stressful events deplete your coping
resources and even harm your health. Complete The Current Culprits Survey in Worksheet
2-3 to uncover the sources of your stress. You can’t make your world less stressful unless
you ﬁrst identify the stress-causing culprits.

You may notice that a few of the items above have positive aspects to them. For example,
retirement or the purchase of a new home may be exciting. However, all major changes,
whether positive or negative, carry signiﬁcant stress that tags along for the ride.

Drawing Conclusions
You didn’t ask for depression or anxiety. Your distress is understandable if you examine the
three major contributors: biology/genetics, your personal history, and the stressors in your
world. Take a moment to summarize in Worksheet 2-4 what you believe are the most impor-
tant origins and contributors to your depression or anxiety.
Worksheet 2-4
My Most Important Contributors
1. Physical contributors (genetics, drugs, illness):
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
2. My personal history:

________________________________________________________________________________
3. The stressors in my world:
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
As you review your summary, we sincerely hope you conclude that you’re truly not at fault
for having depression or anxiety. At the same time, you’re responsible for doing something
about your distress — no one can do the work for you. Just remember that working on your
emotional distress rewards you with lifelong beneﬁts.

Chapter 3
Overcoming Obstacles to Change
In This Chapter
 Uncovering change-blocking beliefs
 Busting beliefs
 Sleuthing self-sabotage
 Slicing through self-sabotage
You don’t want to feel depressed or anxious. And at times it probably seems as if you
have no choice but to feel that way. You want to do something about your distress, 
but you may feel overwhelmed and incapable. Truth is, you can do something about your
predicament. But ﬁrst, you have to understand and overcome the obstacles in your mind
that prevent you from taking action and moving forward.
In this chapter, we help you uncover assumptions or beliefs you may have that make it hard
for you to tackle your problems. After you identify the beliefs that stand in your way, you
can use a tool we provide to remove these obstacles from your path. We also help you dis-
cover whether you’re unconsciously sabotaging your own progress. If you discover that
you’re getting in your own way, we show you how to rewrite your self-defeating script.
Discovering and Challenging 
Change-Blocking Beliefs
You may not be aware that people hold many beliefs about change. For example, some people
believe that change is frightening. Others think they don’t deserve to be happy and there-
fore don’t change their lives to improve their situations. By stealing your motivation to
change, assumptions such as these can keep you stuck in a depressed or anxious state.
And, unfortunately, most people aren’t aware of when and how these underlying assump-
tions can derail the most serious and sincere efforts for making changes.
The quizzes in this section are designed to help you discover whether any change-blocking
beliefs create obstacles on your road to change. After the quizzes, you can ﬁnd an exercise
that assists you in ridding yourself of these beliefs through careful, honest analysis of
whether each belief helps or hurts you.
Detecting beliefs standing in your way
People resist change because they are afraid, feel they don’t deserve something better,
and/or view themselves as helpless to do anything about their circumstances. Unknowingly
holding any of these beliefs will inevitably impede your progress toward change. So take the
following three quizzes to see which, if any, of these barriers exist in your mind. Put a check
mark next to each statement in Worksheets 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 that you feel applies to you.

Worksheet 3-1
The Fear of Change Quiz
❏
1. If I take a risk, I’m likely to fail.
❏
2. If I reach out to others, I’ll get rejected.
❏
3. Whenever I try something new, I manage to screw it up.
❏
4. Every time I get my hopes up, I’m disappointed.
❏
5. If I work on my problems, I’ll fail.
❏
6. I’d rather not try than fail.
❏
7. I can’t see myself as a success.
❏
8. I’m too anxious and depressed to succeed.
Worksheet 3-2
The Underlying Undeserving Belief Quiz
❏
1. I don’t deserve to be happy.
❏
2. I don’t expect much out of my life.
❏
3. I feel less worthy than other people.
❏
4. I feel guilty asking anyone for help, so I’d rather not ask.
❏
5. There’s something fundamentally wrong with me; that’s why I’m distressed.
❏
6. I don’t feel I’m as good as other people.
❏
7. I’m uncomfortable when people are nice to me.
❏
8. I feel like other people deserve a lot more than I do.
Worksheet 3-3
The Unfair, Unjust Belief Quiz
❏
1. It’s easy for me to dwell on how unfair life has been to me.
❏
2. I feel helpless in dealing with my plight.
❏
3. I can’t stop thinking about how I’ve been mistreated.
❏
4. I feel angry about all the bad things that have happened to me.
❏
5. Other people don’t understand how difﬁcult my life has been.
❏
6. Anyone with my life couldn’t help but complain.
❏
7. Hardly anyone could appreciate how much I’ve suffered.
❏
8. Doing something about my problems would somehow discount the importance of
the trauma that has happened in my life.
Now that you’ve taken the quizzes, you can probably see if any of these beliefs dwell in your
mind.
 If you checked two or more items in The Fear of Change Quiz, you probably get scared
at the thought of changing.
 If you checked two or more items from The Underlying Undeserving Belief Quiz, you
may feel that you don’t deserve the good things that could come to you if you were to
change.
32
Part I: Analyzing Angst and Preparing a Plan 

 If you checked two or more items from The Unfair, Unjust Belief Quiz, you may dwell so
much on how you’re suffering that you have trouble marshalling the resources for
making changes.
 If, by chance, you checked two or more items in two or more quizzes, well, you have a
little work cut out for you.
It’s not your fault if you hold any of these change-blocking beliefs. People pick up on these
ideas as children or through traumatic events at any time in their lives. And some change-
blocking beliefs have a touch of truth to them; for instance,
 Life is often unfair.
 It’s reasonable sometimes to feel a little angry.
 You can’t always succeed.
However, people deserve to feel happy, including you. You can succeed in the things you do,
and you can move past the bad things that have happened to you. Even if you’ve experienced
horriﬁc trauma, moving on doesn’t diminish the signiﬁcance of what you experienced. Getting
better simply makes you more powerful and allows you to live again.
Jasmine, a mother of three, worries all the time. As a child, she was sexually abused by a
babysitter. Now, she tends to be overly protective of her own children. Lately, she’s been
sleeping poorly; her youngest child has asthma, and Jasmine ﬁnds herself listening to the
child’s breathing throughout the night. She panics when her middle child is late from school.
Her oldest son is an exchange student in another country and rarely calls home, so images
of him being hurt or kidnapped ﬂoat through Jasmine’s mind throughout the day. Her doctor
is concerned about her rising blood pressure, so Jasmine decides to work on her anxiety
and stress. She takes the three change-blocking beliefs quizzes (presented earlier in this
section) and discovers a variety of change-blocking beliefs, although the fear and undeserv-
ing beliefs predominate. She then ﬁlls in her Top Three Change-Blocking Beliefs Summary,
which you can see in Worksheet 3-4.
Worksheet 3-4
Jasmine’s Top Three Change-Blocking Beliefs Summary
1. Whenever I try something new, I manage to screw it up.
2. Every time I get my hopes up, I’m disappointed.
3. I feel guilty asking anyone for help, so I’d rather not.
Next, Jasmine jots down her reﬂections on both this exercise and the change-blocking
beliefs she’s identiﬁed in the summary (see Worksheet 3-5).
Worksheet 3-5
Jasmine’s Reﬂections
I can see that I do have some of these change-blocking beliefs. I guess I’ve
always thought that this is just the way my life is. But now that I reﬂect on it, I
guess I can see how these beliefs could get in the way of doing something
about my problems. Nothing is going to change if I hold on tightly to these
assumptions. But what can I do about them?
33
Chapter 3: Overcoming Obstacles to Change

In the next section, Jasmine sees what she can do about her problematic beliefs. But before
jumping to her resolution, try ﬁlling out your own Top Three Change-Blocking Beliefs
Summary in Worksheet 3-6. Go back to the three change-blocking belief quizzes and look at
the items you checked. Then write down the three beliefs that seem to be the most trou-
bling and the most likely to get in the way of your ability to make changes.

In Worksheet 3-7, jot down your reﬂections about these beliefs. What have you learned? Do
you think these beliefs are helping you or getting in your way? Write down anything that
comes to mind.
Worksheet 3-7
My Reﬂections
Blasting through beliefs blocking your path
After completing the exercises in the last section, you should have an idea of which change-
blocking beliefs may be holding up your progress. If you’ve tried to make changes in the
past and failed, it’s very likely that one or more of these beliefs are responsible. Unfortunately,
ridding yourself of such problematic beliefs isn’t as easy as sweeping them out the door; it’s
more than a matter of knowing what they are and declaring that you no longer believe in
them. Fortunately, we have some tools to help you revise your way of thinking.
Changing beliefs requires that you appreciate and understand the extent to which your
assumptions cause trouble for you. If you’ve only just now discovered what your beliefs are,
you can’t be expected to fully understand the pros and cons associated with them. We ﬁnd
that analyzing advantages and disadvantages helps achieve this insight.
Jasmine ﬁlls out an Analyzing Advantages and Disadvantages Form (see Worksheet 3-8) in
order to more fully comprehend how her change-blocking beliefs affect her. She starts by
writing down the reasons her change-blocking beliefs feel good and advantageous to her.
Next, she writes about how each belief gives her problems — in other words, how it stands
in her way. Finally, she reviews both lists very carefully and writes down her conclusions.
She ﬁlls out this form for each belief in her Top Three Change-Blocking Beliefs Summary.
(This example only includes analysis of two of Jasmine’s beliefs.)

After completing her Analyzing Advantages and Disadvantages Form, Jasmine takes some
time to reﬂect. She considers whether the advantages she listed are truly advantages and
concludes that her original change-blocking beliefs are causing her more harm than good.
She then writes down her reﬂections in Worksheet 3-9.
35
Chapter 3: Overcoming Obstacles to Change

Worksheet 3-9
Jasmine’s Reﬂections
I realize that when I don’t try, I still end up failing, so not trying isn’t really an
advantage. And yes, change may be a lot of work and seem overwhelming, but
I’m utterly miserable. When I think about it, I get satisfaction from helping
others. So logically, they wouldn’t mind helping me from time to time. I could
use some help, and it might feel really nice to get close to people. On balance,
these change-blocking beliefs are keeping me stuck.
Clearly, Jasmine can see that her assumptions about change are causing her to remain in
limbo. Now that she’s completed the exercises and disputed those assumptions, she can
start moving forward. Because she’s aware of these beliefs, she can be on the lookout for
them to pop up again and remind herself of their considerable disadvantages.
Now it’s your turn.
1. In Worksheet 3-10, write down each of your change-blocking beliefs (see Work-
sheet 3-6).
2. Jot down all the reasons that each belief feels right, true, and useful to you.
3. For each belief, write down the other side of the argument; in other words, make a
list of all the ways in which your belief may actually be causing you harm.

If you get stuck on any of these exercises, or if you see more advantages than disadvantages
to your change-blocking beliefs, consider talking with your therapist or possibly a close
friend for further help and advice.
Looking Out for Self-Sabotage
Overcoming anxiety or depression is tough and sometimes even frightening work. (Even
positive change evokes fear in most people!) As a result, people tend to resist, avoid, or pro-
crastinate working on their problems. This means you have to be on the lookout for
self-sabotage. Self-sabotage describes the things you do to keep from addressing and cor-
recting your problems, and it appears in various forms and disguises.
Some people self-sabotage by telling themselves that change is impossible. Others defeat
themselves by ﬁnding reasons to put off working on their issues. What are your reasons for
avoiding making changes?

Complete the checklist in Worksheet 3-12 to see if you’re falling into the self-sabotage trap.
Check off any statements you hear running through your mind.
Worksheet 3-12
The Hindering Change Checklist
❏
1. I feel my situation is hopeless.
❏
2. I’ll never be okay because of my past.
❏
3. I want to wait to make changes until just the right time, but that time never comes.
❏
4. I want a guarantee that I’ll get better before I’m willing to risk change.
❏
5. I use a lot of excuses for not dealing with my problems.
❏
6. It’s hard for me to stick with something if it doesn’t help right away.
❏
7. Sometimes I get confused or out of it when I try to tackle my issues.
❏
8. If I don’t succeed 100%, I get very critical of myself.
❏
9. If I do something well, it’s hard for me to give myself credit for it.
❏10. I want fast results, or else I just can’t get motivated to try.
❏11. I dwell so much on my past failures that it’s hard to try something new.
❏12. My depression or anxiety is biological, so I can’t do anything about it.
It isn’t hard to see how thoughts like these could bog you down and prevent active efforts
to change. Yet almost everyone engages in at least a little self-sabotage, whether consciously
or not.
Don’t make your problems worse by pummeling yourself when you see that you’re self-
sabotaging. Self-criticism merely piles on more self-sabotage. Instead, monitor your self-
sabotaging thoughts. When you feel them getting in your way, ﬁght back and argue against
them using the Self-Sabotage Diary presented in the next section.
Stopping self-sabotage
Throughout this book, we ask you to write out your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and life events.
That’s because writing is an invaluable tool for battling problematic emotions, sorting out
issues, achieving important insight, and solving problems. In this section, we invite you to
track and record your inevitable acts and thoughts of self-sabotage in a diary. But ﬁrst, see
how Molly ﬁlls out her Self-Sabotage Diary.
Molly is a busy, highly successful professional at the top of her career. None of her col-
leagues are aware that she suffers from considerable anxiety and depression. She worries
that others will discover that she doesn’t deserve her professional success. She realizes
that, for the last decade, she has neglected friends and family in pursuit of success. Now,
she feels lonely and despondent; success hasn’t brought her the happiness she expected,
and her anxiety and depression have only increased. Molly sees a psychologist, and together
they identify her self-sabotaging tendencies. She keeps a diary in which she records her acts
of self-sabotage and responses to them. Worksheet 3-13 contains ﬁve days’ worth of Molly’s
diary.

Now, it’s time for you to make a Self-Sabotage Diary. Remember to take your time.
1. In the middle column of Worksheet 3-14, write down any thought or action from that
day that you feel limits your efforts at overcoming your anxiety or depression. If you
get stuck, review The Hindering Change Checklist for examples.
2. In the right-hand column, write down how helpful (if at all) you think the self-
sabotage may have been as well as any arguments you can ﬁnd against it.
3. Maintain this diary for at least one week; keep it up much longer if you continue to
see lots of self-sabotage.
Criticizing yourself for the sabotage you notice yourself committing only leads to more sab-
otage. Stop the cycle!

Rewriting your self-sabotaging scripts
Our minds create stories — about ourselves, our lives, and our worlds. If you feel stuck,
your stories are probably cloaked in themes of failure. For example, you may have a long-
running play in your mind that has you as its central character. That character has a series
of mishaps, failures, and missed opportunities. If this sounds familiar, it’s time to rewrite 
the script. Try creating a new story about you and your life that allows you to ultimately
succeed. But remember, in addition to success, the new story needs to contain realistic
struggle and difﬁculty. After all, life isn’t a fairy tale.
To the outside world, Molly is successful. On the inside, she feels like a fraud. Worksheet
3-15 illustrates her personal story.

Molly struggles to rewrite her script. When she ﬁnishes, she reads her new story every day
for a month. Although it takes her a while to start believing it, gradually she begins to see
her life in a new light. Worksheet 3-16 contains her revised story.
Worksheet 3-16
Molly’s New Life-Script
I have a good job, and I worked very hard to get it. I don’t need to discount my
accomplishments. Yes, I do get irritable sometimes, and who doesn’t? Besides,
I’m capable of learning new behaviors, and I’m working on my irritability. I don’t
have many friends because I’m a workaholic. This will be a struggle for me, but
I see myself cutting back a little on my work and making new friends. I’m going
to put more meaning in my life. For starters, I plan to do some volunteer work.
Now it’s your turn. Follow these instructions:
1. In Worksheet 3-17, write your current life-script, including how you see yourself
today and in the future. How do you view your accomplishments, relationships, and
failures?
2. In Worksheet 3-18, write a new life-script. Be sure to include your thoughts on hope,
change, possibilities, as well as struggle.
3. Read your new life-script daily for a month. Feel free to make changes to it as you
see ﬁt.

Chapter 4
Minding Your Moods
In This Chapter
 Listening to your body
 Figuring out your feelings
 Connecting events and feelings
 Tracking thoughts, events, and feelings
You can’t overcome anxiety and depression by running on autopilot. Learning how to feel
better starts with self-observation. In this chapter, we provide instructions for observing
the relationships among your feelings, your thoughts, and the happenings in your life.
First, you monitor your body’s response to events. This information helps you become
more aware of the physical components of depression and anxiety. Next, you keep track of
your feelings. Some people aren’t very good at identifying their feelings, so we help you by
providing a list of feeling words. Then you observe how events, feelings, and bodily sensa-
tions go hand in hand. Finally, we show you how to become aware of how thoughts link up
with feelings, events, and bodily sensations. The path to feeling better starts with under-
standing these connections.
Deciphering Body Signals
Your heart may race or your hands may sweat when you feel anxious. Changes in appetite
and sleep may accompany feelings of sadness and depression. These physical reactions
signal that something important is going on internally. Monitoring your bodily sensations
gives you an early warning that a storm of emotional distress is brewing.
Tyler is surprised when his doctor diagnoses him with depression. His friends say he’s out
of touch with his feelings. Tyler begins to understand his body’s signals by monitoring phys-
ical sensations on a daily basis. He ﬁlls out the Body Responses Tracking Sheet shown in
Worksheet 4-1. He jots down any time that he feels something uncomfortable in his body
and includes information about what was going on at the time.

After ﬁlling out his Body Responses Tracking Sheet, Tyler takes some time to reﬂect on the
exercise (see Worksheet 4-2).
Worksheet 4-2
Tyler’s Reﬂections
I noticed that my body seems to react to what’s going on in my life. I really
wasn’t aware of that before. These sensations aren’t very pleasant, and maybe
the doc is right that I’m depressed. I realize that talking with my ex-wife and my
boss both make me feel pretty weird and stressed. I also think I’m worried
about ﬁnances although I haven’t wanted to admit it. Now that I know all this, I
really want to do something to get myself to a better place.
Now ﬁll out your own Body Responses Tracking Sheet (see Worksheet 4-3) and record your
reﬂections on the exercise (see Worksheet 4-4).
1. Once or twice a day, review each of the body responses in the left-hand column.
2. If you experienced a reaction in a given category, elaborate and specify how your
body reacted (in the middle column).
3. Record when the body response happened and what was going on at the time. This
information should help you connect the dots between events and responses.
4. After completing the tracking sheet, take some time to think about what you see.
Write a few reﬂections.

Connecting the Mind and Body
After you become more observant of your body’s signals, it’s time to connect your mental
and physical states. Feeling words connect and label these combined states. If you’re unac-
customed to describing your feelings, spend some time looking over the list of words in the
following chart and ponder whether they apply to you. Take your time, and don’t rush the
process.
Track your feelings every day for a week using the Daily Unpleasant Emotions Checklist in
Worksheet 4-5. See Chapter 17 for exercises relevant to positive emotions.
1. Each day, circle all the feeling words that describe your emotions.
2. At the end of the week, look back over your checklist and tally the most prevalent
feelings. Use Worksheet 4-6 to reﬂect on the exercise.

Putting Events, Feelings, 
and Sensations Together
As you work through this chapter, you should become more aware of how your body reacts
to events in your life. And thanks to the Daily Unpleasant Emotions Checklist in the previous
section, you have feeling words to label your mental and physical states. It’s time to connect
these body sensations and feeling words to the events that trigger them.

Chapter 4: Minding Your Moods

Jasmine suffers from constant worry and anxiety. She thinks that her worries mainly center
on her children, but at times she has no idea where her anxiety comes from. So, she ﬁlls out
a Mood Diary. She pays special attention to her body’s signals and writes them down when-
ever she feels something unpleasant. She then searches for a feeling word that captures her
emotion. She rates the emotions and sensations on a scale of 1 (almost undetectable) to 
100 (maximal). She then asks herself what was going on when she detected her distress.
Worksheet 4-7 is a sample of Jasmine’s Mood Diary; speciﬁcally, it’s a record of four days on
which Jasmine noticed undesirable moods.

Jasmine keeps track of her moods over the course of a couple of weeks. After studying her

Worksheet 4-8
Jasmine’s Reﬂections
Well, I’m surprised. I thought that all I worried about was the kids. Truth is, my
job really gets me stirred up. Conﬂict isn’t easy for me either. I’d better do
something about that. My shyness gets in my way, too. I didn’t realize how often
I have these feelings.
Now it’s your turn to ﬁll out a Mood Diary (see Worksheet 4-9). This exercise can provide
you with invaluable information about patterns and issues that consistently cause you dis-
tress. This knowledge helps you see what needs to change in your life. The exercise also
lays a foundation for changing your thinking, which we get into in Part II of this book.
1. For at least one week, pay attention to your body’s signals and write them down
whenever you feel something unpleasant.
2. Search for a feeling word that captures your emotion and jot it down. Refer to the
Daily Unpleasant Emotions Checklist earlier in this chapter for help ﬁnding the right
feeling words.
3. Rate your feeling on a scale of intensity from 1 (almost undetectable) to 100 
(maximal).
48
Part I: Analyzing Angst and Preparing a Plan 

4. Ask yourself what was going on when you started noticing your emotions and
body’s signals. The corresponding event can be something happening in your world,
but an event can also be in the form of a thought or image that runs through your
mind. Be concrete and speciﬁc; don’t write something overly general such as “I hate
my work.” Instead, ask yourself what happened at work that you didn’t like.
5. Look over your Mood Diary to see if you can draw any conclusions or come up with
any new insights into where your body signals come from. Write a few sentences of

Chapter 4: Minding Your Moods

Worksheet 4-10
My Reﬂections
Becoming a Thought Detective
Imagine yourself in a parking lot at night. You’re tired and back your car into a cement pole.
Crunch. What’s your reaction? Do you have angry thoughts like “Who the bleep put that
post there!?” Do you feel anxious and worried about the costs of repair? Or do you feel dis-
traught and upset with yourself because you believe you were careless?
Anyone is likely to feel upset for a little while after banging up a car. However, if your thoughts
are intense or persistent, they provide clues about your negative thinking habits. These
habits dictate how you interpret the accident and thus the way you feel about it. If you feel
terribly worried, it’s probably because you tend to have lots of anxious thoughts. If the acci-
dent leaves you overly down on yourself, you may be prone to depressive thoughts.
Thought Trackers show you how feelings, events, and thoughts connect — they lay it all 
out for you. What are you saying to yourself when you feel upset? See how Molly, Tyler, and
Jasmine complete their Thought Trackers before you try a few for yourself.
Molly runs her car into a pole one night. Her psychologist has been having her ﬁll out
Thought Trackers for the past week whenever she notices upsetting feelings. So later that
night she completes a Thought Tracker on the incident (see Worksheet 4-11).

All three of them look at this event in unique ways, and they feel differently as a result. Molly
worries about the consequences of the accident and puts herself down. Because of the way
she interprets the event, Molly’s at risk for anxiety and depression. Tyler gets mad and cata-
strophizes the fender-bender. He tends to have problems with anger and depression. On the
other hand, Jasmine panics about the bash into the pole; her reaction is the product of her
frequent struggles with anxiety and panic.

Sometimes people say they really don’t know what’s going on in their heads when they feel
distressed. They know how they feel and they know what happened, but they simply have
no idea what they’re thinking. You may experience this problem. If so, ask yourself the ques-
tions in Worksheet 4-14 about an event that accompanied your difﬁcult feelings.

Part I: Analyzing Angst and Preparing a Plan 

The Thought Tracker demonstrates how the way you think about occurrences inﬂuences
the way you feel. Sad feelings inevitably accompany thoughts about loss, low self-worth, or
rejection. Anxious or worried feelings go along with thoughts about danger, vulnerability, or
horrible outcomes. To complete your Thought Tracker in Worksheet 4-15, follow these
instructions:
1. Pay attention to your body’s signals and write them down whenever you feel some-
thing unpleasant.
2. Search for a feeling word that captures your emotion and jot that down, too. Refer to
the Daily Unpleasant Emotions Checklist earlier in this chapter for help.
3. Rate your feeling on a scale of intensity from 1 (almost undetectable) to 100 
(maximal).
4. Ask yourself what was going on when you started noticing your emotions and
body’s signals. The corresponding event can be something happening in your world,
but an event can also come in the form of a thought or image that runs through your
mind. Be concrete and speciﬁc; don’t write something overly general such as “I hate
my job.” Instead, ask yourself what happened at work that you didn’t like.
5. Record your thoughts in the thoughts and interpretation column. Describe how you
perceive, interpret, or think about the event. Refer to the preceding Thought Query
Quiz if you experience any difﬁculty ﬁguring out your thoughts about the event.

thinking. Distorted means that your thinking doesn’t accurately reﬂect, predict, or describe
what’s going on. Have you ever heard a noise in the night that woke you up and scared you?
Perhaps your mind ﬁlled with thoughts of dread and images of someone breaking into your
house. Only rarely are such thoughts accurate. More often than not, the noise results from
wind or creaking ﬂoorboards. But when you hear a bump in the night, your fear is very real.
Your thoughts, while understandable, are distorted.
Distorted thinking can be overly positive as well as negative. For example, we have a dog we
think is truly beautiful, but most of our friends and neighbors think he’s a peculiar-looking
mutt. No doubt our perception is slightly ﬂawed; it’s understandable because we love our
dog, but it’s distorted nevertheless.
Distorted thinking is a problem when it leads to depression and anxiety. We call these kinds
of distortions reality scramblers. The three types of reality scramblers are:
 The Information Reality Scramblers
 The Self-Judging Reality Scramblers
 The Self-Blame Reality Scramblers
Although this chapter makes distinctions among various types of reality scramblers, in real-
ity, scramblers often overlap or exist in groups. To put it another way, a single thought can
involve several Information Reality Scramblers as well as scramblers involving self-judging
and self-blame. The examples used throughout this chapter show you how scramblers 
combine.
The Information Reality Scramblers
Information Reality Scramblers warp your perceptions of your world and events occurring
around you; they distort how you think about what’s really happening. You may not know
that Information Reality Scramblers affect your thinking, but if you give it a little thought,
you’re likely to see that they do.

Information Reality Scramblers consist of the various ways in which the mind distorts the
information coming into it. For example, suppose a depressed man receives a mediocre per-
formance review at work. He’s likely to enlarge this event and turn it into a complete
catastrophe by assuming that he’s totally worthless as a person. That Information Reality
Scrambler is called enlarging. Without the scrambler, the reality is simply that his perform-
ance was considered average even though he would have preferred a better rating.
This exercise shows you all the various ways that Information Reality Scramblers can affect
your thinking and ultimately the way you feel.
1. Read the description of each type of Information Reality Scrambler and the accom-
panying examples in Worksheet 5-1.
2. Think about when your thoughts might have been inﬂuenced by the Information
Reality Scrambler.
3. Reﬂect and write down any examples of speciﬁc thoughts that you’ve had which
might be distorted by an Information Reality Scrambler. If you can’t think of an 
example for each type of Information Reality Scrambler, that’s okay. We give you more
exercises for seeing how they do their work later in this chapter.
Worksheet 5-1
Information Reality Scramblers Exercise
1. Enlarging and shrinking: Your mind magniﬁes the awfulness of unpleasant events and
minimizes the value and importance of anything positive about yourself, your world, 
or your future. For example, we may think, “It’s horrible that we have to write six pages
today. We can’t stand it!” Truth is, we may not feel like writing six pages, but the task
hardly compares with more trying events such as losing someone close or being diag-
nosed with a serious health problem.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
2. Filtering: Your mind searches for dismal, dark, or frightening data while screening out
more positive information. The not-too-surprising result? The world (or yourself) looks
bleak or more frightening than it is. For example, suppose you receive a job evaluation
that rates you highly on most areas but contains one average rating. You proceed to
focus exclusively on the average rating and conclude that the evaluation was mediocre.

Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

3. Seeing in black-or-white, all-or-none terms: Your mind views events and your 
character as either black or white, with no shades of gray. Thus, a single bad grade or
performance, for example, indicates complete failure. Or when teenagers notice blem-
ishes on their faces, they often conclude that they look totally horrible. The problem
with such polarized thinking is that it sets you up for inevitable failure, disappoint-
ment, and self-abuse.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
4. Dismissing evidence: Your mind discards evidence that may contradict its negative
thoughts. For example, suppose you’re preparing a speech and have the thought that
when it comes time to give the speech, you’ll be so scared that you won’t be able to
talk. Your mind automatically dismisses the fact that you’ve given numerous speeches
before and have never been so afraid you couldn’t talk.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
5. Overgeneralizing: You look at a single, unpleasant occurrence and decide that this
event represents a general, unrelenting trend. For example, a wife tells her husband
that she’s furious because he’s always late, but in reality he’s late only about 10 percent
of the time. Words like always and never are clues to overgeneralization.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
6. Mind reading: You assume that you know what others are thinking without checking it
out. Thus, when your boss walks by you without saying hello, you automatically think,
“She’s really angry with me; I must have messed something up.” In reality, she’s merely
distracted.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
59
Chapter 5: Untangling Twisted Thinking

7. Emotional reasoning: You treat feelings as facts. For example, if you feel guilty, you
conclude that you must have done something wrong. Or if you don’t feel like working
on your depression, you assume that means you’re unable to. And if you’re afraid of
something, it must be dangerous merely because you fear it.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
8. Unreliable forecasting: You presume a negative outcome without any real evidence.
For example, you have an argument with your partner and believe that he or she will
certainly leave you. Or, you avoid driving on the freeway because you’re convinced
that you’ll get in an accident.

Here are the answers to the Thought Tracker Information Reality Scrambler Practice exercise.
Don’t worry if your answers don’t perfectly match ours — the point is simply learning to
observe distortions at work. And sometimes the precise distortions involved are debatable.
 Scenario 1: Enlarging, unreliable forecasting, seeing in black-and-white terms, emo-
tional reasoning
 Scenario 2: Dismissing the evidence, mind reading, ﬁltering
 Scenario 3: Enlarging, overgeneralizing, unreliable forecasting
It’s time to start tracking your own thoughts and looking for possible Information Reality
Scramblers. This process helps you to see that some of your unpleasant feelings actually
come from the way your mind misinterprets events in your world. The following instruc-
tions guide you in building your own Thought Tracker in Worksheet 5-5, but for more
complete information about Thought Trackers, see Chapter 4.
1. Pay attention to your body’s signals and write them down whenever you feel some-
thing unpleasant.
2. Search for a feeling word that captures your emotion and jot it down. Refer to the
Daily Unpleasant Emotions Checklist in Chapter 4 for an extensive list of feeling words
to get you started.
3. Rate your feeling on a scale of intensity from 1 (almost undetectable) to 100 
(maximal).
4. Ask yourself what was going on when you started noticing your emotions and your
body’s signals, and record that event. The event can be something happening in your
world or it can come in the form of a thought or image that runs through your mind. Be
concrete and speciﬁc when recording events. Don’t write something overly general such
as “I hate my work;” instead, ask yourself what happened at work that you didn’t like.
62
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

5. Record your thoughts in the appropriate column by describing how you perceive,
interpret, or think about the event. Refer to The Thought Query Quiz in Chapter 4 if
you experience any difﬁculty ﬁguring out your thoughts about the event.
6. Using the Information Reality Scramblers information from Worksheet 5-1, record
the distortions you believe are at work.

In working through the exercise in Worksheet 5-5, were you able to ﬁnd the Information 
Reality Scramblers in your thinking? If so, we expect you’ll begin questioning whether or not
your thoughts about events are always accurate. With that doubt comes the possibility of
seeing things a little differently — more realistically, actually. Record your reﬂections in
Worksheet 5-6. We hope we’re beginning to shake up your thinking (see Chapter 6 for a 
variety of strategies for replacing distorted thinking with more accurate perceptions).

Chapter 5: Untangling Twisted Thinking

Worksheet 5-6
My Reﬂections
The Self-Judging Reality Scramblers
The Self-Judging Reality Scramblers twist the way you view yourself and your behavior.
Depressed and anxious minds tend to be harshly critical, judgmental, and self-abusive. Why
is that a problem? Because self-judging is another form of self-sabotage. Although you may
think otherwise, self-criticism doesn’t motivate you to do anything positive or productive;
rather, it only makes you feel worse and leaves you with less energy for changing.
Self-Judging Reality Scramblers come in three different forms:
 Shoulds
 Critical comparisons
 Loathsome labels
Shoulding on yourself
One of our favorite quotes comes from psychologist Dr. Albert Ellis, who said, “Stop should-
ing on yourself.” That phrase rings true for the vast majority of clients we see in our
practices as psychologists. And we must admit, we occasionally fall victim to the tyranny of
the should as well. Shoulding involves putting yourself down by telling yourself that you
should be or act different in some way. It can refer to past, present, or future actions.
Shoulding scrambles accurate self-views and turns them into self-criticisms.
To identify your own shoulds, take the quiz in Worksheet 5-7, putting a check mark next to
each thought that has run through your mind.
Worksheet 5-7
The Shoulding-on-Yourself Quiz
❏I should have known better.
❏I shouldn’t eat that much.
❏I should be a better person.
❏I should have been more careful.
❏I shouldn’t have distorted thoughts!
❏I shouldn’t be so crabby.
64
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

❏I shouldn’t make so many mistakes.
❏I should exercise more.
❏I should be nicer to people.
❏I shouldn’t get so upset about things.
So what’s wrong with these thoughts? (We can almost hear you thinking, “But I SHOULD eat
less, be a better person, or not get so upset about things!”) Well, there’s no rule chiseled in
granite stating that you should or must act or think in certain ways. Shoulding is a form of
criticism that makes you feel bad because guilt and shame don’t motivate positive behavior.
The bottom line is that shoulding doesn’t help. You shouldn’t should on yourself — just kid-
ding, sort of.
The alternative to shoulding on yourself is recognizing that it may be a good idea to do
things differently but refusing to engage in harsh self-judgment. Before you get to your own
should alternatives, in Worksheet 5-8, you can read Murphy’s should statements and see
how she develops alternatives to shoulding on herself.

2. Listen for any time that you tell yourself, “I should” or “I shouldn’t.”
3. Record those statements in the left-hand column.
4. Come up with alternative perspectives for each should statement and write them in
the right-hand column. Words like “prefer,” “would like to,” “wish,” and “would be
better if,” make good alternatives to “should.”

Making critical comparisons
Are you the richest, best-looking, or smartest person in the world? Neither are we. There’s
always someone who has more of something than you do. Even if you’re the best at 
something, that doesn’t mean you’re the best at everything. People have strengths and
weaknesses, and if you do think you’re the best at everything, you have a problem that’s
quite different from anxiety or depression.
Everyone engages in comparing themselves to others sometimes. But anxious and
depressed folks tend to rate themselves more negatively and place more value on those
comparisons.
To identify your negative personal comparisons, put a check mark next to each item in
Worksheet 5-10 that you sometimes examine in yourself and then compare to others.
66

❏Looks and appearance
❏Intelligence
❏Popularity
❏Fame
❏Gadgets (a guy thing)
❏House
❏Car
❏Clothes
❏Status
❏Age
❏Knowledge
Essentially, the less comparing you do, the better off you are. However, the seduction of
comparisons lies in the fact that they contain a kernel of truth. The reality is that there’s
always someone richer, younger, or higher on the ladder than you. Comparisons may be
unavoidable, but they become problematic when you conclude that you’re not good enough
because you’re not the top or the best.
What’s the alternative to making critical comparisons that scramble the way you see 
yourself? Like should alternative statements (see “Shoulding on yourself”), comparison
alternatives are all about looking at an issue from a different, less harsh perspective. Before
creating your own alternative statements, take a look at Worksheet 5-11 for an example.

2. List those statements in the left-hand column.
3. Come up with alternative perspectives and record them in the right-hand column.
Because only one person in the world is at the top on any given issue or activity, try to
accept that you’ll be average, normal, or even occasionally less than average at many
things. Comparing yourself to the very top only leaves you disappointed, so appreciate
your own strengths, weaknesses, and chosen priorities.

Tagging yourself with loathsome labels
Sticks and stones can break your bones, and words can really hurt you. The ﬁnal Self-

with demeaning labels, and when you do, you inevitably feel worse.

Labels erode your self-worth. They always involve overgeneralization and black-and-white
thinking (see the section “The Information Reality Scramblers” earlier in this chapter). Labels
represent concepts that hold no redeeming value; they don’t help you, and they often lead
to increased emotional distress. So what should you do when you hear these labels ﬂoating
through your mind? See Worksheet 5-14 for examples of self-labels and new ways of looking
at them.

If you stop calling yourself useless, hurtful names, and replace the labels with more reason-
able perspectives, you’ll feel better. Therefore, we recommend that you complete the Label
Replacement Exercise in Worksheet 5-15 each time you hear those destructive labels in your
mind:
1. Tune into what you’re telling yourself when you feel upset, and listen for any time
that you tag yourself with a hurtful label.
2. Write the triggering event in the left-hand column.
3. Write the label you’re putting on yourself in the middle column.
4. Come up with alternative perspectives to the labels and record them in the right-
hand column. In creating label replacements, try to accept any portion of the event
that has truth in it, such as having gained some weight, but look at the issue more real-
istically. Try to be self-forgiving. Because labels tend to be overarching ratings (that is,
they imply a bigger problem than the event that triggered them), your replacement
thoughts should be speciﬁc and look for positive possibilities.
If you have trouble coming up with label replacement thoughts, don’t worry. Jump to
Chapter 6 for lots of ideas for challenging negative self-talk.

The Self-Blame Reality Scrambler
When sadness or anxiety clouds your thinking, you’re likely to add to your distress by
assuming full responsibility for your misery. You may accuse yourself of being inept, inca-
pable, or inadequate and therefore fully culpable for all your suffering. When the Self-Blame
Reality Scrambler is at work, you attribute all fault and blame to yourself. Doing so leads
you to wallow in shame and self-loathing.
In this section, we give you a tool for ﬁguring out if you use the Self-Blame Reality Scrambler.
After you begin to understand that your problem isn’t completely your fault, you can take
action on the portion for which you own responsibility. The Rating Responsibility Exercise
helps you see that most problems have many causes and that you only own a portion of the
responsibility. Accepting these facts can help you lessen the guilt and shame you feel. After
you understand the causes of the problem, you’ll be more ready to do something produc-
tive about it. 
Robin blames herself for her recent divorce and believes that she is almost entirely respon-
sible for her husband leaving the marriage for another woman. Robin considers herself
boring and unattractive, and she berates herself for not seeing the signs early enough to
prevent what happened. Robin decides to take the Rating Responsibility Exercise (see
Worksheet 5-17), focusing on the blame she places on herself for her divorce.

As you can see, Robin initially assigns 95 percent of the blame for the divorce on herself. At
the end of the quiz, Robin reassesses her level of responsibility because she’s able to see
things a bit more objectively. She re-rates the level of blame she puts on herself and identi-
ﬁes that 20 percent seems more appropriate — she’s only partly responsible. This
knowledge helps her to feel less guilty and self-disparaging.
Now that you’ve seen the Rating Responsibility Exercise in action, it’s time to evaluate the
level of responsibility you feel you carry. In other words, you’re ﬁguring out how much of
the problem is you. Complete your Rating Responsibility Exercise in Worksheet 5-18 by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Name the problem you’re blaming yourself for. Write this at the top of the 
worksheet.
2. Using a percentage from 1 to 100, rate how much blame you put on yourself for this
problem. At the top of the worksheet, write this percentage under the problem
you’ve identiﬁed.
3. In the left-hand column, list all imaginable causes of your problem.
4. In the right-hand column, using a number from 1 to 100, estimate the percentage of

My re-rated level of responsibility is: ______________________________________________
Some people deny any and all responsibility for problems they encounter. These folks usu-
ally ﬁnd a convenient scapegoat such as a mother, father, signiﬁcant other, society, or event
to blame for all their woes. Failing to accept any responsibility for your troubles makes you
see yourself as helpless and the world as unfair and unjust (check out Chapter 3 for more
information about such self-sabotaging beliefs). Realize that you don’t want to fall into that
trap — read the next section to see how to avoid it.
Doing What You Can to Solve the Problem
In this section, you face your problem and take action to change it. By assessing your
responsibility and determining what you can do about your problem, you avoid immersing
yourself in self-loathing and harsh self-blame. This approach allows you to take respon-
sibility for an appropriate portion of the problem and do what you can with it. If your
responsibility involves something that’s over and done with, no action is possible. But you
can still try to let go of the shame that leads nowhere and does nothing to help you. And
you may be able to do some things to prevent a similar problem in the future.

ost people simply assume that thoughts they have about themselves and the world
are true. But thoughts don’t always reﬂect reality, just as funhouse mirrors don’t
reﬂect the way you really look. In Chapter 5, we help you uncover the distortions (also
known as reality scramblers) in your thoughts.
In this chapter, you become a thought detective. No, you don’t need a magnifying glass or
sharp-looking hat and trenchcoat. All you need are the tools and instructions we provide in
this chapter . . . and an open mind. We show you how to take your distorted thoughts to
court and charge them with the crime of inﬂicting misery on yourself. If you ﬁnd them guilty
(and we think you will), you see how to rehabilitate those criminal thoughts so that they
can contribute to your well-being.
From Arraignment to Conviction: Thought Court
We base our technique called Thought Court on the principles of cognitive therapy.
Cognitive therapy was founded in the late 1950s by Dr. Aaron T. Beck, who discovered that
changing the way people think changes the way they feel. Many studies attest to the fact
that cognitive therapy works very well to alleviate anxiety and depression. Therefore, we
recommend that you regularly work on the exercises in this section. Do this work until you
ﬁnd yourself starting to think and feel differently . . . then do it for a little while longer.
Thought Court begins with a Thought Tracker. Thought Trackers show you how feelings,
events, and thoughts connect. We give you examples of Thought Trackers in this section,
but for more information, ﬂip to Chapter 4.
Thought Court is a process of indicting the accused thought (the one you pinpoint in your
Thought Tracker) and then bringing it to trial. You play the roles of defense attorney, 
prosecutor, and judge. As the defense attorney, you present the evidence that supports the
validity or accuracy of the thought. In other words, the defense claims that your thought 
is true and isn’t culpable for your anguish. On the other side, you, as the prosecutor, lay 
out a case demonstrating that the thought is actually guilty of distortion and therefore has
caused you unnecessary emotional distress. In Thought Court, you’re also the judge. If you
ﬁnd the thought guilty, we give you ways to replace or rehabilitate your thought.

Frankly, you’re very unlikely to ﬁnd the thought innocent, but if you manage to consistently
ﬁnd your thought justiﬁed or innocent of causing you unnecessary harm, you should seek
consultation with a mental health professional. You may need a fresh perspective to help
sort out your troubles.
Most people learn better through stories and examples than through laborious explana-
tions. With that in mind, we help you master the process of Thought Court by presenting a
case example in the next section. Then we give you the chance to put your thoughts on trial,
and in case you need more help, we follow up your practice with more case examples.
Examining a sample case in Thought Court
Jeremy is a good looking 23-year-old personal trainer who takes pride in his healthy
lifestyle. People admire his strength and athleticism. He’s known at the gym for the colorful,
long-sleeved T-shirts that he always wears. Jeremy gets more than his share of attention
from women, but he never gets involved because he has a secret: He was seriously burned
as a child, and his chest and arms are deeply scarred. Jeremy has never had a serious rela-
tionship; he believes any woman seeing his body would recoil in disgust. Rather than face
rejection and ridicule, he locks himself away in solitary conﬁnement.
Jeremy ﬁnds himself very attracted to a young woman he meets at the gym. She’s obviously
drawn to him as well. When she asks him out for coffee, he panics and puts her off. His com-
bination of fear and yearning motivates him to see a therapist, and he manages to tell his
therapist about his lifelong secret. Jeremy’s therapist suggests that he start examining his
thoughts with a Thought Tracker (see Worksheet 6-1) and then take his thoughts to
Thought Court.

After he completes his Thought Tracker, Jeremy and his therapist pull out his most trou-
bling thoughts, what we call the most malicious thoughts.
78
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

Jeremy’s most malicious thoughts:
1. I couldn’t stand to see the look of repulsion on her face.
2. It’s not fair that I was burned and have to go through life this way.
Jeremy ﬁnds the Thought Tracker exercise interesting. He realizes that two thoughts create
the most emotional pain for him. Next, his therapist suggests that Jeremy put the ﬁrst 
of these thoughts on trial using a worksheet (later on, they address his other malicious
thought). As you can see in Worksheet 6-2, Jeremy writes down the malicious thought ﬁrst
and then in one column defends the thought by listing all the reasons, logic, and evidence
he can muster to support the case that the thought is true. In the other column, Jeremy
attempts to prosecute the thought by demonstrating that it’s false.

So far, this case is going very well for the defense and very poorly for the prosecution. Thus,
Jeremy remains quite convinced that his thought is a true reﬂection of reality; it’s just the
way things are. He can’t imagine being persuaded to change his thought. The therapist tells
him he’s made a good start but asks him to consider the Prosecutor’s Investigative
Questions in Worksheet 6-3 and write down his reﬂections on those questions (see
Worksheet 6-4).

8.
What would happen if I just started acting as though the thought weren’t true?
Worksheet 6-4
Jeremy’s Reﬂections
These questions are a little difﬁcult to contemplate. But let’s see. Are there any
distortions in my accused thought? Well, I guess I would really dislike seeing
repulsion on her face, but I could probably “stand it.” So I might be enlarging
somewhat. And I suppose I’ve seen attractive women who are with guys who
have substantial disabilities like morbid obesity, missing limbs, and so on. I was in
that burn support group, and I admit there were some people who had nice
relationships after they’d been burned. So I guess it’s possible she may not be
repulsed. And I guess the thought is doing me more harm than good because
it keeps me from ever considering a relationship. Maybe it’s worth testing out if
it’s true or not.
After Jeremy reﬂects on the list of Prosecutor Investigative Questions, his therapist advises
him to take another look at his Thoughts on Trial Worksheet and try to add more evidence
and logic to his case (see Worksheet 6-5).

At this point, Jeremy carefully reviews the case presented in his Revised Thought on Trial
Worksheet. He ﬁnds his accused thought guilty of inﬂicting unnecessary misery. He and his
therapist agree to work on a replacement thought for his most malicious thought (see the sec-
tion “After the Verdict: Replacing and Rehabilitating Your Thoughts” later in this chapter).
After he creates the ﬁrst replacement though, he continues putting his other malicious
thoughts on trial and replacing them, one at a time.
Putting your thoughts on trial
You guessed it; it’s your turn to visit Thought Court. Don’t be concerned if you struggle in
your initial attempts; this important exercise takes practice. (And if you’re still confused
after examining your own thoughts, you can ﬁnd several more examples to illustrate further
how this process works.) The ﬁrst step is to complete a Thought Tracker (see Worksheet
6-6) by following these instructions:
81
Chapter 6: Indicting and Rehabilitating Thoughts

1. Pay attention to your body’s signals and write them down whenever you feel some-
thing unpleasant.
2. Search for a feeling word that captures your emotion and jot it down. Refer to the
Daily Unpleasant Emotions Checklist in Chapter 4 for help ﬁnding the right feeling words.
3. Rate your feeling on a scale of intensity from 1 (almost undetectable) to 100 
(maximal).
4. Ask yourself what was going on when you started noticing your emotions and your
body’s signals. The corresponding event can be something happening in your world,
but an event can also be in the form of a thought or image that runs through your
mind. Be concrete and speciﬁc; don’t write something overly general such as “I hate
my work.” Instead, ask yourself what happened at work that you didn’t like.
5. Record your thoughts in the Thoughts/Interpretations column of the worksheet.
Describe how you perceive, interpret, or think about the event. Refer to The Thought
Query Quiz in Chapter 4 if you experience any difﬁculty ﬁguring out your thoughts
about the event.
6. Review your thoughts and write down the thought or thoughts that evoke the great-
est amount of emotion — your most malicious thoughts.

need to use the Thought Court method numerous times to feel the full beneﬁt.
After you complete the Thought Court process, decide for yourself whether or not your
thought is guilty of causing you unneeded emotional distress such as anxiety, depression, 
or other difﬁcult feelings. Even if you conclude that your thought has some grain of truth,
you’re likely to discover that it’s highly suspect of causing you more harm than good. In
Thought Court, you don’t judge your thought guilty only on the basis of “beyond a reason-
able doubt.” Rather, we suggest you judge your thoughts on the “preponderance of evidence”;
in plain English, convict your thought if the evidence weighs heaviest on the guilty side.
Reviewing more Thought Court cases
To help you understand Thought Court better, this section contains a few more examples.
Because the Thought Tracker also appears in Chapters 4 and 5, we start with the accused
thought here, which comes from the most malicious thoughts at the end of a Thought
Tracker (see “Putting your thoughts on trial”).
Connor: Doomed to unhappiness
Over the years, Connor, a 58-year-old high school teacher, became an avid outdoorsman,
spending his summer vacations camping, ﬁshing, and hiking. Although his arthritis has been
getting progressively worse, Connor has tried to ignore the pain. In fact, he only consults
his doctor when the pain becomes overwhelming. His doctor refers him to an orthopedic
specialist who tells Connor he needs a hip replacement. Connor slips into depression at the
news. He ﬁlls out some Thought Trackers and zeroes in on a malicious thought: “I’ll never
be happy again. Life will just be a downhill slide from here.” He accuses this thought of
increasing his misery and puts it on trial (see Worksheet 6-9).

Connor carefully considers the evidence. His verdict: Guilty as charged. He now realizes the
thought, “I’ll never be happy again — life will just be a downhill slide from here,” is far from
the truth and certainly doesn’t help him cope with his reality.
Emma: Filled with anxiety
Emma, a 37-year-old loan ofﬁcer, regularly puts in a 50-hour workweek. A divorced mom,
she juggles the responsibilities of work and parenting. She’s also a perfectionist and expects
to be able to handle everything. Understandably, Emma is often plagued with anxiety. She
worries about keeping up with her job and being a good mother to her two children. So
when Emma’s son brings home a mediocre report card, she crashes into a terrible depres-
sion. She loses her temper and screams at her son, and then she berates herself for being a
terrible mother. Emma completes a Thought Tracker and then puts her most malicious
thought on trial (see Worksheet 6-10).

Thought Court is one of the most effective tools for combating anxiety, depression, and
other unpleasant emotions. If you have trouble with the exercise, spend more time going
over the Prosecutor’s Investigative Questions in Worksheet 6-3. It also doesn’t hurt to
review Chapter 5 and re-read the examples in this chapter. If you still struggle, we recom-
mend you consult a mental health professional who’s proﬁcient in cognitive therapy.
After the Verdict: Replacing and 
Rehabilitating Your Thoughts
Hopefully, the prosecution presents a convincing case against a variety of your malicious
thoughts, and you begin to see that many of your thoughts are guilty of scrambling reality
and causing excessive emotional distress. When criminals are convicted, society usually
tries to rehabilitate them and give them a second chance. The same thing goes for guilty
thoughts.
In this section, we show you how to rehabilitate your guilty thoughts, one at a time.
Rehabilitating your thoughts decreases feelings of depression and anxiety because rehabili-
tated thoughts are less distorted, judgmental, and critical. We call rehabilitated thoughts
replacement thoughts because they replace your old malicious thoughts.
A replacement thought is a balanced, realistic appraisal of your problem. The reason for
forming a single replacement thought is that you can use that new thought repeatedly when-
ever the old, malicious thoughts start rumbling through your mind. The new thought is a
quick and easy comeback to negative, distorted, reality-scrambled thinking.
You can use a number of different techniques to develop effective replacement thoughts.
The strategies outlined in the following sections help you discard distortions and straighten
out your thinking. With these strategies, you discover how to replace your twisted thoughts
with more helpful, realistic replacement thoughts. We provide four separate strategies for
developing replacement thoughts. If one doesn’t work for you, be sure to try the others.
87
Chapter 6: Indicting and Rehabilitating Thoughts

Getting a little help from a friend
This rehabilitation strategy is pretty simple. You start by imagining that a good friend of
yours is going through the same kind of problem as you are. Your friend has the same kind
of thoughts as you do about the problem. Now imagine your friend sitting across from you.
You feel empathy for your friend, and you want to help.
What do you say? How do you suggest your friend think about this situation? It’s important
that you look at your friend’s problem from an honest viewpoint. We don’t want you to
simply try to make your friend feel better by sugarcoating the issue; rather, tell your friend
about a reasonable way to think about the problem.
The essence of this powerful, yet surprisingly simple, technique is that the advice you would
give a friend is advice you can give to yourself. The strategy works by helping you get a
little distance from your problem. Viewing thoughts and feelings from a distance helps you
be more objective. The following example shows you how to use Getting Help from a Friend
to your advantage.
Emma (see “Emma: Filled with anxiety” earlier in this chapter) has taken her most malicious
thought to Thought Court and found it guilty. Now she turns to Getting Help from a Friend
to rehabilitate that thought. She thinks about her best friend, Louise. She imagines Louise
coming to her with the same problem and concerns about her son. In other words, Louise is
thinking Emma’s most malicious thought and seeking advice (see Worksheet 6-11).
Emma’s/Louise’s most malicious thought:
I’m a complete failure as a mother; my son is falling apart.
Worksheet 6-11
Emma’s Getting Help from a Friend (Louise)
Well, Louise, I know you feel like a failure, but your son only came home with
two C’s and three B’s. That’s not exactly catastrophic. Sure, you haven’t spent
as much time with him lately, but you’ve been pretty tied up at work. That hap-
pens. You don’t need to beat up on yourself. Talk with his teacher and see what
you can do to help. Quit sounding like a helpless victim. Besides, your son is 16
now; don’t you think he has something to do with his own success and failure?
It isn’t all about you.
Emma reviews her imaginary discussion with Louise. She sees that her perspective changes
when she gives Louise advice rather than listen to the negative automatic dialogue in 
her own head. Next, she distills this perspective into a single replacement thought (see
Worksheet 6-12).

My son isn’t falling apart and I’m not a failure. All I can do is see what I can do

Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

Take one of your most malicious thoughts and use the Getting Help from a Friend strategy
to devise an effective response to that thought. Of course, it helps to take the malicious
thought to Thought Court ﬁrst, which you’ve done — right? We did mention this is a work-
book? That means you need to do the work for this book to help you. So if you haven’t
worked on these exercises yet, no problem. Start now!
1. Write down one of your most malicious thoughts from your Thought Tracker (see
Worksheet 6-6).
2. Think of someone you know and respect.
3. Imagine that the friend has a problem very similar to your own and has similar
thoughts about the problem.
4. Imagine you’re talking with your friend about a better way to think about and deal

Traveling to the future
The events that disrupt your life today rarely have the same meaning after a few days,
weeks, or months. For example, have you ever felt distraught about any of the following?
89
Chapter 6: Indicting and Rehabilitating Thoughts

 Someone cutting you off in trafﬁc
 Being embarrassed
 Locking yourself out of your car
 Forgetting someone’s name
 A minor illness or injury
 Spilling something
 For women (well, mostly women anyway): A run in your nylon hose
 For men (again, for the most part): Cutting your face shaving
 A bad hair day
 A fender bender
 A trafﬁc ticket
 Running late
Events like these so often lead to very malicious thoughts and highly distressing feelings. If
you think back on these events after some time has passed, however, rarely can you muster
up the same intensity of emotion. That’s because most upsetting events truly aren’t all that
important if you look at them in the context of your entire life. Check out the following
example of the Traveling to the Future technique in action.
Joel owns a piece of land on a busy corner. He’d like to sell the property, but he knows it’s
worth far more if it can be zoned for commercial purposes ﬁrst. In order to do that, Joel
must present his case in front of the Zoning Commission. He expects some opposition and
criticism from homeowners in the area, and he’s been putting this task off for months
because of the intense anxiety it arouses in him.
He ﬁlls out a Thought Tracker (see “From Arraignment to Conviction: Thought Court” ear-
lier in this chapter) and identiﬁes his most malicious thought: “I’ll make a fool out of myself.
I’ll probably stumble all over my words and sound like an idiot.” He travels to the future
with this thought to help him gain a better perspective; Joel asks himself how he’ll look at
this issue at various times in the future (see Worksheet 6-15). He rates the emotional upset
and effect on his life that he feels right now, and then he re-rates the impact on his life at the
conclusion of the exercise.
Worksheet 6-15
Joel’s Traveling to the Future
If I do indeed make a fool out of myself, I’ll probably feel pretty bad and the
impact on my life will feel like 30 or even 40 on a 100-point scale. I’ll still feel
embarrassed a week later. I suspect that images of the incident will go through
my mind fairly often, but six months from now, I doubt I’ll think about the inci-
dent much at all. I’m sure that a year later I will have almost completely
forgotten about it. So I guess the overall effect on my life will likely be about a 1
on a 100-point scale.
After pondering what his malicious thought will seem like in the future, Joel feels ready to
develop a more realistic replacement thought (see Worksheet 6-16). 
90
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

Worksheet 6-16
Joel’s Replacement Thought
Even if I should happen to make a fool out of myself, it’s hardly going to be a
life-changing event. I may as well just go ahead and present the case.
The Traveling to the Future technique won’t apply to all your thoughts and problems, but it
works wonders with quite a few. In Joel’s case, he could have analyzed his malicious
thought for obvious distortions such as labeling and enlarging. He also could have taken the
malicious thought to Thought Court. In other words, be sure to try out a variety of strate-
gies for rehabilitating your thoughts in order to ﬁnd the one that works best for you and for
a particular thought or thoughts.
Take one of your most malicious thoughts and use the Traveling to the Future strategy to
devise an effective response to that thought.
1. Write down one of your most malicious thoughts from your Thought Tracker (see
Worksheet 6-6).
2. In Worksheet 6-17, rate the overall amount of upset and impact you feel at the
moment (on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 representing the highest imaginable impact).
3. Think about how your thoughts are likely to change in a week.
4. Think about how your thoughts are likely to change in six months.
5. Think about how your thoughts are likely to change in a year.
6. Re-rate how much impact you’ll feel as a whole.
7. In Worksheet 6-18, write down a balanced, summary replacement thought based on
any new perspective you obtain with this strategy.

Chapter 6: Indicting and Rehabilitating Thoughts

Recalculating risks
When you’re anxious, worried, or depressed, your mind frequently focuses on the future and
makes dire predictions. People worry about things yet to happen to them, such as facing a
plane crash, catching germs, encountering heights, and experiencing embarrassment. They
predict that whatever they undertake will result in horror, misery, or unhappiness. Yet, such
worries typically far exceed the actual odds of unwanted outcomes. In other words, people
tend to overestimate the risks of negative outcomes, and they do so more often when
they’re in emotional distress.
When you predict negative outcomes, you have malicious thoughts that paralyze you from
taking action. In order to develop replacement thoughts for your malicious ones, you ﬁrst
need to rethink your negative predictions. Then we suggest that you recalculate your actual
risks. After you analyze your predictions, you’ll be able to rehabilitate your malicious
thoughts. The following example illustrates this technique.
Melinda’s boss, Allison, takes a month off work after the birth of her baby. Melinda takes on
Allison’s responsibilities in her absence and assumes the extra work without thinking about
it. She performs ﬂawlessly. After a month, Allison announces that she isn’t returning to work.
Melinda is offered Allison’s job. Oddly, Melinda now ﬁnds herself racked with fear and anxi-
ety. She predicts that she won’t be able to handle the job, and she can’t see herself as a boss.
Her most malicious thoughts are, “I’m not cut out to handle supervising others — I’m a fol-
lower, not a leader. I can’t do this.”
Melinda takes the Rethinking Negative Predictions Quiz shown in Worksheet 6-19 to prepare
her to test out her negative predictions.
Worksheet 6-19
Melinda’s Rethinking Negative Predictions Quiz
1. How many times have I predicted this outcome and how many times has it actually
happened to me?
There are other challenges in my life that I thought I couldn’t do. I didn’t think I’d
make it through college and I did. I actually can’t think of any times that I failed
at something important to me.
2. How often does this happen to people I know?
I can’t recall a single instance in this company when someone has been pro-
moted and then ﬁred.
3. If someone else made this prediction, would I agree?
Not necessarily. I would base my prediction on past performance. I guess mine
has been pretty good.
4. Am I assuming this will happen just because I fear that it will, or is there a reason-
able chance that it will truly happen?
Of course, there’s a small chance I won’t be able to handle the job. But clearly,
I’m making some unwarranted assumptions here. After all, I’ve done the job
successfully for a month.
92
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

5. Do I have any experiences from my past that suggest my dire prediction is unlikely
to occur?
Again, for the past month, I have done ﬁne. I’ve never really failed at anything,
come to think of it.
After ﬁlling out her answers to this quiz, Melinda decides to act on her recalculated risk by
taking the job. She ﬁnds she actually enjoys the new challenges. She looks back over her
most malicious thought and develops a replacement thought (see Worksheet 6-20).
Worksheet 6-20
Melinda’s Replacement Thought
While I don’t “feel” like a leader, the evidence says otherwise. I’m capable, and
I’m doing it!
Take one of your most malicious thoughts and use the Testing Thoughts strategy to devise
an effective response to that thought.
1. When you ﬁnd yourself making a negative prediction about some upcoming event
or situation, write down your most malicious thought.
2. Take the Rethinking Negative Predictions Quiz in Worksheet 6-21.
3. Act on your recalculated risk by doing the thing you fear.
4. In Worksheet 6-22, write out a replacement thought for your original prediction and
use it in similar future situations.

Assuming your answers tell you that the odds are in your favor, go ahead and test out your
negative predictions. Jump right in and do what you fear. Then jot down a replacement
thought (in Worksheet 6-22) for your original malicious thought.
If the odds of a bad outcome are high, go to the Worst-Case Scenario strategy in the next
section of this chapter, where you can ﬁnd techniques for coping with bad outcomes.
Worksheet 6-22
My Replacement Thought
Imagining the worst
The preceding section shows you how to rethink risks because, in general, when people are
depressed or anxious, they greatly overestimate the odds of bad things happening. And they
grossly underestimate their abilities to cope.
94
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

But just in case you’re starting to think otherwise, we’re not trying to convince you that bad
things never happen. They do. People get sick, accidents happen, and relationships end.
Stuff happens. Sometimes really bad stuff. What then? Imagining yourself dealing with worst-
case scenarios is a useful exercise because it helps you understand that you can get through
whatever it is that you fear. The following example shows you how the Worst-Case Scenario
Quiz helps Martha make a decision and develop a replacement thought for her malicious
thought.
Martha has been single for the past 20 years. Since her painful divorce, she’s had a number
of casual dates, but work and raising her child have kept her attention away from develop-
ing a serious relationship. Now at age 50, Martha has fallen in love with someone special,
and he feels the same way. However, she ﬁnds herself withdrawing out of fear that things
won’t work out. She predicts that if she commits to the relationship, her companion will ulti-
mately reject her, and she couldn’t stand that. Martha identiﬁes her most malicious thought
as, “I’d rather be alone forever than risk the pain of rejection again; I don’t think I could deal
with that.”
Martha takes the Worst-Case Scenario Quiz shown in Worksheet 6-23 to identify and work
through her greatest fear.
Worksheet 6-23
Martha’s Worst-Case Scenario Quiz
1. Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past?
I was rejected by my ex-husband. It took me quite a while, but I got through it.
Today, I’m actually fairly happy.
2. How much will this affect my life a year from now?
If he rejects me, I’ll be hurt and alone. I’ve been okay alone for a while now. A
year from now, I suspect I’ll be sad, but I think I’ll be getting over the worst of
the rejection.
3. Do I know people who have coped with something like this, and how did they do it?
I have lots of friends who’ve lost relationships. They got through it by staying
active and seeking support from others. A couple of my friends went to therapy,
which they said helped.
4. Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support?
Over the years, I’ve developed a pretty good network of friends. I know I could
get support from them. My family has always been there for me, too.
5. Can I think of a creative, new possibility that could result from this challenge?
If this relationship doesn’t work, I think I’ll volunteer to work with Habitat for
Humanity in another country. I’ve always wanted to do something like that. I love
travel and meeting new people. I think that experience would be very meaning-
ful to me.
Now, Martha’s ready to devise a more realistic replacement thought (see Worksheet 6-24).

Correcting Your Life-Lenses: 
A New Vision
In This Chapter
 Understanding the power of life-lenses
 Discovering your problematic life-lenses
 Changing the way you see things
W
hen people get out of bed every morning, they open their eyes and look at their
world. Some folks grab glasses off the nightstand, others need to get up and put in
their contacts to see better. Some lucky people have 20/20 vision.
What most people don’t know is that everyone’s vision of reality is altered by special life-
lenses. Life-lenses are strongly held beliefs or assumptions that you have about yourself,
your relationships with others, and your world. Life-lenses powerfully inﬂuence how you
respond to, interpret, and feel about events, but you may not be aware that you look
through them.
Perhaps you know of people who view the world through rose-colored glasses. As perpetual
optimists, they see the best in everything and everyone. On the other hand, you probably
know a few folks who view the world through dark, gloomy shades. They expect the worst
and rarely see the positive side of things.
In this chapter, we help you understand the nature of life-lenses. Your views of people, events,
and even your self-image depend upon which lenses you look through. This chapter helps
you realize whether your lenses are dirty, cracked, smoky, colored, or clear. A quiz shows
you which lenses you look through and how they may cause you emotional trouble, and the
exercises demonstrate how to change problematic life-lenses.
Examining Life-Lenses
Everyone has certain unquestioned assumptions about life. Many assumptions are rather
useful. For example, it’s not a bad idea to assume that day follows night, taxes must be paid,
food is located at grocery stores, most drivers stop at red lights, and hard work usually
pays off. Not questioning these assumptions makes life more efﬁcient. Think about how
snarled trafﬁc would be if no one assumed that red means stop and green means go. Or just
consider how much time you’d waste if you searched for food in department stores,
schools, and libraries rather than assuming that you’d ﬁnd it in grocery stores.
Life-lenses are special types of unquestioned assumptions. These assumptions or beliefs
color the way you feel about yourself and the things that happen to you. For example, you

may look through a perfectionistic life-lens and therefore believe that you must be perfect all
the time. Or perhaps you have a vulnerable life-lens and thus assume that the world is a dan-
gerous place. As we explore assumptions (that is, life-lenses) such as these, you can see that
they form the foundation of your most distressing emotions, such as depression, anxiety,
worry, irritability, apprehension, and even anger.
Life-lenses are the broad themes or assumptions you live by. These themes directly inﬂu-
ence the kinds of thoughts you have and, in turn, how you feel about what happens to you.
Each life-lens can be activated by many types of events.
Susan and Diane work as nurses at a local hospital. They both apply for one open manage-
ment position. Although Susan and Diane are both well qualiﬁed, a nurse from another
hospital gets the job. Susan reacts with anger and comments, “I deserved that job; the
administration had no right to give that job away. I’ll never cooperate with the creep that
stole my job.”
Diane reacts quite differently. She feels gloomy and says, “I’m sure they made the right deci-
sion picking someone else. I shouldn’t have let my supervisor talk me into applying. I’m not
management material.”
Susan and Diane have different life-lenses. Susan has the life-lens of entitled. She believes
that she always deserves the best; Susan feels that the world owes her and that if she wants
something, it should be hers. On the other hand, Diane has the life-lens of inadequacy. She
thinks that she’s not good enough and that others have more skill and talent than she does.
Diane assumes that she couldn’t do the job even though her supervisor told her she has the
appropriate ability and background.
Same event. Different thoughts and different feelings. Susan’s entitled life-lens makes her
prone to tension and anger when her needs aren’t met. Diane’s inadequacy life-lens steers
her in the direction of depression when her adequacy is called into question.
Susan and Diane apply their respective life-lenses to many different events in their lives. For
example, when they’re both caught in an unexpected trafﬁc jam, they view the event through
their own life-lenses and thus experience different thoughts and feelings. Susan’s entitled
life-lens leads her to feel rage and have thoughts like, “No one in this town knows how to
drive. What idiots!” Diane, who looks through an inadequacy life-lens, scolds herself, “I
should have left earlier. Why didn’t I listen to the trafﬁc report this morning? I’m an idiot!”
With some understanding of life-lenses, it’s time to take a look at which lenses may be
affecting you and your life. After all, changing the way you feel starts with identifying your
problematic life-lenses. If you aren’t aware of your own life-lenses, you’re powerless to do
anything about them.
The questionnaire in Worksheet 7-1 is designed to clarify which life-lenses may be causing
you trouble. After you identify them, we tell you a little more about how they work, where
they come from, and most importantly, what you can do about them. Before you start mark-
ing the life-lenses in the worksheet that apply to you, consider the following tips:
 Answer as honestly as possible. Sometimes, people respond how they think they
“should” answer rather than responding with honest self-appraisals. Self-deception
isn’t useful.
 Take your time to reﬂect on various events and situations that have happened 
to you that are relevant to each lens. For example, in answering questions about 
abandonment-fearful versus intimacy-avoidant, ponder the relationships you’ve had
and how you feel and react to those close to you. You shouldn’t rush this task.
100
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

 Base your answer on how you feel and react in situations that relate to each lens.
For example, if you frequently feel inadequate but know in your head that you’re actu-
ally not inadequate, answer on the basis of how you feel when your adequacy comes
into question, such as when you’re asked to make a speech.
 Don’t worry about inconsistencies. As you see in Worksheet 7-1, life-lenses come in
opposite pairs. And you very well may ﬁnd yourself using both lenses from time to
time. For example, if you’re a perfectionist, you may also quite often feel inadequate
when you make a mistake. Or if you normally feel unworthy and undeserving, you may
ﬁnd yourself feeling quite angry and entitled on occasions when your needs unexpect-
edly go unmet. People often ﬂip between opposite lenses, so don’t worry if you seem a
little inconsistent.
 Answer on the basis of how often each lens describes you. If you see parts of the
description that apply and others that don’t, underline the parts that ﬁt and rate your-
self on those parts in terms of how often they apply to you.
Use a scale of 1 to 5 for your frequency rating.
 1 if the lens almost never describes you
 2 if it occasionally describes you
 3 if it sometimes describes you
 4 if it usually describes you
 5 if it almost always describes you

Any life-lens that you rate as 3 or above probably gives you trouble now and then. If you dis-
cover that you have many life-lenses that you rate as 3 or above, don’t worry. Many people
have a range of these problematic assumptions. Change takes time, but you can do it — one
lens at a time.
Take a few minutes now to reﬂect on the results of your Problematic Life-Lenses
Questionnaire. In Worksheet 7-2, jot down thoughts about how these life-lenses may be
causing you to have troubling emotions. Don’t worry if you’re not quite sure of the connec-
tions; we give you more ways of seeing the lenses’ inﬂuence on your life in the next few
sections of this chapter.
Worksheet 7-2
My Reﬂections
How life-lenses work
You may wonder just how much trouble life-lenses create and why we say they’re the root
cause of most emotional turmoil. The examples in this section give you an idea about how
they work their mischief. The exercise in this section is likely to convince you of just how
much life-lenses affect your vision and your emotional life.
After you identify your life-lenses, it’s a good idea to consider more examples of how the
lenses lead to problematic thoughts and feelings. Notice how the life-lenses are a broad
theme and the thoughts are speciﬁc to a given event.
Jim, Paul, and Wayne are friends and neighbors. All three have teenage daughters who are
the same age and also best friends. One evening, the girls are late coming home. Jim, Paul,
and Wayne have very different reactions. See how life-lenses inﬂuence how the fathers inter-
pret this identical event and respond to their daughters.
102
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

Jim has a guilty and blameworthy life-lens. He feels like he’s done something wrong, even
when it’s not his fault (see Worksheet 7-3).

Chapter 7: Correcting Your Life-Lenses: A New Vision

1. When events happen and you notice distressing feelings, write the event down. The
event can be something happening in your world or something that runs through your
mind. Whatever it is, be speciﬁc.
2. In the middle column, write down the thoughts or interpretations you have about
the event. In other words, describe how you perceive or think about the event. If you
have difﬁculty with this step, ﬂip to Chapter 6 for more information about events and
thoughts.
3. In the right-hand column, write down any feelings you have about the event. Check
out the Daily Unpleasant Emotions Checklist in Chapter 4 for a list of feelings.
4. Review the Problematic Life-Lenses Questionnaire in Worksheet 7-1 (you did do it,
didn’t you?). Think about which life-lens ﬁts your thoughts and feelings best and
write that in the left-hand column. You may discover that more than one lens applies.
Also, include a brief deﬁnition of the life-lens based on the reﬂections you recorded in
Worksheet 7-2. Feel free to shorten and/or tailor the deﬁnition so that it ﬁts you better.
5. In Worksheet 7-7, reﬂect on what this exercise tells you about your problematic
emotions and where they come from.

Worksheet 7-7
My Reﬂections
The origins of life-lenses
Usually, the prescription for your life-lenses is established in your childhood. People don’t
come into the world seeing themselves as inadequate, undeserving, entitled, or perfectionis-
tic. Rather, they learn these patterns through repeated experiences. Life-lenses emerge from
abuse, abandonment, betrayal, criticism, natural disasters, loss, rejection, and other emo-
tionally powerful events.
Some life-lenses even develop from well-meaning parents who unwittingly go overboard
(probably because of their own life-lenses). For example, some parents worry so much that
they overprotect their children, who subsequently feel vulnerable. Other parents overindulge
their children in the name of love and caring, and their kids may end up feeling entitled.
On the road to understanding and changing your life-lenses, it helps to reﬂect on what caused
you to acquire the lenses you look through in the ﬁrst place. When you understand these
origins, you can release the notion that you’re crazy, weird, or messed up. Self-forgiveness
releases energy that you can use for grinding new lenses for better vision.
Hannah struggles with depression and anxiety. She takes the Problematic Life-Lenses
Questionnaire shown in Worksheet 7-1 and identiﬁes the life-lenses of intimacy-avoidant and
entitled. She also realizes that she’s perfectionistic but ﬂips to feeling inadequate when she
makes a mistake. Hannah reﬂects on her childhood for possible causes of her life-lenses.
She then completes the Childhood Origins of Life-Lenses exercise shown in Worksheet 7-8
and reﬂects on her ﬁndings in Worksheet 7-9.

Hannah’s Reﬂections
When I look back on my childhood, I realize that my family was pretty cold.
They expected me to be perfect, and when I wasn’t, I was treated with scorn.
It’s no wonder I feel anxious about being perfect and feel depressed when I’m
not. There wasn’t a lot of love in my family, so I’ve learned to keep my distance
from others. I was taught that possessions and status are more important than
people, so I’ve invested too much time and effort on getting the things I want.
But I feel empty and lonely.
To uncover the origins of your life-lenses in the same way that Hannah did, follow these
instructions and complete Worksheets 7-10 and 7-11.
1. Review each life-lens that you rated as 3 or above on your Problematic Life-lens
Questionnaire (see Worksheet 7-1).
2. For each of those lenses, reﬂect on your childhood. Feel free to look back at Chapter
2 for help with ways of recalling past feelings and events.
3. Jot down anything from your childhood that you believe may have contributed to
each of your problematic life-lenses.
4. After you complete this exercise, take some time to reﬂect on any new insights
you’ve discovered and record them in Worksheet 7-11.

My Reﬂections
Changing the Prescription of Your Life-Lenses
After you complete the exercises in the preceding sections, you should know which life-
lenses cause you problems. In this section, we give you three techniques for regrinding your
life-lenses. It would be nice if you could toss the old lenses in the trash or throw them on
the ground and stomp on them. But these lenses consist of almost shatterproof material —
after all, they’re cast from the emotional turmoil of childhood (see “The origins of life-
lenses”). Thus, you need to proceed slowly and cautiously.
You may ﬁnd the task of changing your life-lenses more challenging than you expected. Even
if you put a lot of time and work into it, when you’re tired or stressed, you may ﬁnd yourself
looking through your outdated prescription. That’s okay. Your new prescription takes a
while to break in. You’re bound to use the old one out of habit. Your goal is simply to use
the new lenses more often than the old ones (until you can’t even ﬁnd the old ones). If you
ﬁnd the task too difﬁcult, please consult a mental health professional.
Distinguishing the past from the present
Life-lenses develop from emotionally signiﬁcant events in childhood, and they make sense
when viewed in conjunction with those events. Your world has no doubt changed a great
deal over the years, but you probably still look through many of the same old lenses. And
those lenses don’t give you a clear vision of present-day reality.
107
Chapter 7: Correcting Your Life-Lenses: A New Vision

As you can see in Worksheet 7-8, Hannah developed the life-lens of perfectionistic. As a kid,
she was harshly criticized when she wasn’t perfect, so the lens helped her avoid some of
that criticism. The lens was a healthy adaptation to her life at the time. But today, as an
adult, her perfectionistic life-lens causes her anxiety, stress, and even depression when she
fails. Furthermore, no one in her life is nearly as critical as her father was. So she doesn’t
need to be perfect to avoid harsh criticism today. Her perfectionistic lens distorts her vision.
Hannah completes the Then and Now Exercise in Worksheet 7-12 in order to help her under-
stand how her past experiences cause her to overreact to current triggers. Seeing this
connection will help her change her life-lens.

Eleven-year-old Adam had a warm and caring family. He lived in a nice neighborhood and
attended a reputable public middle school. He was bright but not brilliant. He played sports
well enough and had many friends. In short, he was an unlikely candidate for developing
problematic life-lenses.
Tragically, one beautiful fall day a highly disturbed classmate brought a gun to school and
shot three students. Adam witnessed the event and was slightly injured. Subsequently,
Adam suffered from nightmares, experienced intrusive images of the event, and was easily
startled. Understandably, Adam developed a vulnerable life-lens.
As an adult, anxiety often overwhelms Adam. His vulnerable life-lens is activated by events
only superﬁcially similar to the original trauma. Adam completes the Then and Now Exercise
in Worksheet 7-13 in order to help him understand how his past experiences contribute to
his current responses. This connection helps him begin to change his life-lens.

You know the routine. Take some time to ﬁll out the Then and Now Exercise (see Worksheet
7-14) for each problematic life-lens that you identiﬁed in Worksheet 7-1 earlier in this chap-
ter. Whenever one of your problematic life-lenses is activated, refer back to this form in order
to remind yourself that your feelings and reactions today have more to do with yesteryear
than with your current reality.
1. In the left-hand column, write down one of the problematic life-lenses that you rated
as 3 or above on your Problematic Life-Lens Questionnaire (see Worksheet 7-1). Also
include a brief deﬁnition of the life-lens based on your reﬂections from Worksheet 7-2.
Feel free to shorten and/or tailor the deﬁnition so that it ﬁts you better.
2. Reﬂect on your childhood and, in the middle column, record any memories or
images that probably had something to do with the development of your life-lens.
Review Worksheet 7-10 for ideas.
3. Be on the lookout for events that trigger your life-lens, and write those events down
in the right-hand column as they occur.
Because each lens often has multiple images and a variety of triggers, you should ﬁll out a sep-
arate form for each problematic life-lens. And whenever your problematic life-lens is triggered,
review this Then and Now Exercise as a reminder of what your reaction is actually all about.

For almost any problematic life-lens, you need to employ an array of strategies in order to
feel signiﬁcant beneﬁt. Don’t expect a single exercise to “cure” you, and always consider
professional help if your own efforts don’t take you far enough.
After you complete the exercise, take some time to reﬂect on what you’ve learned about
yourself and your feelings, and record your reﬂections in Worksheet 7-15.
Worksheet 7-15
My Reﬂections
Tallying up costs and benefits 
of current life-lenses
The process of changing life-lenses stirs up some anxiety in most people. That’s because
people believe (whether consciously or unconsciously) that life-lenses either protect or
beneﬁt them in some important ways. For example, if you have a vulnerable life-lens, you
probably think that seeing the world as dangerous helps you avoid harm. Or if you possess
a dependency life-lens, you likely think that it guides you to ﬁnd the help from others that
you truly need.
But you may not have as much awareness of the costs of your life-lenses. This section helps
reveal the hidden costs of problematic life-lenses. Only when you fully believe that your life-
lenses cause you more harm than good do you have the motivation to change them.
Cameron, a 22-year-old college student, loves to have a good time. He looks at his world
through the under-control life-lens. Cameron rarely sets limits on himself or others and 
doesn’t think he should have to. He says what he thinks and does what he wants. His high
intelligence and easy-going personality have enabled him to get by — until recently.
Lately, Cameron’s drinking, which has never been under great control, escalates. He hangs
out at bars until they close. Hangovers often cause him to miss classes, and his grades, pre-
viously hovering just above passing, sink into the failure zone. Cameron gets picked up for a
DWI and is put on academic probation in the same week. He reels from the impact of these
events and becomes depressed. Alarmed, his parents encourage him to see someone at the
Student Mental Health Center.
After discovering that Cameron looks through an under-control life-lens, his therapist suggests
that he ﬁll out a Cost/Beneﬁt Analysis of his life-lens. Because patients often downplay the
beneﬁts of their life-lenses when they’re in therapy, his therapist suggests that he ﬁrst
ponder the advantages of his life-lens (see Worksheet 7-16).

Cameron doesn’t have much trouble ﬁguring out beneﬁts for his problematic life-lens. In
fact, at this point, he’s not even sure the lens is problematic at all. However, his therapist
urges him to carefully consider any negative consequences, or costs, of his under-control
life-lens. Worksheet 7-17 shows Cameron’s completed Cost/Beneﬁt Analysis.

Take the time to carefully complete this exercise in Worksheet 7-18.
1. Write down one of the problematic life-lenses that you identiﬁed in Worksheet 7-1.
Also, include a brief deﬁnition of the life-lens based on your reﬂections in Worksheet

times, you may need to reﬂect a while. Write down everything you come up with.
3. In the right-hand column, record any and all conceivable costs of your problematic
life-lens. It’s a good idea to start by looking at the presumed beneﬁts and responding

Taking direct action against 
problematic life-lenses
The exercises in the previous two sections were designed to increase your motivation and
set the stage for altering your life-lenses. In this section, our guidelines for developing an
action plan show you how to prepare for an all-out assault on your life-lenses. Ready . . . 
set . . . go!
To tackle the action steps, you start by ﬁguring out the effect your life-lens has had on you,
your emotions, and your life. For example, if you have the perfectionistic life-lens, you may
realize that this lens causes inordinate tension and worry; basically, you obsess over every
little error.
The next step in taking action is to devise a plan that tests the assumptions behind your 
life-lens. For example, an action step for the perfectionistic life-lens tests out the assumption
that you must never make mistakes. The test is an experiment in which you intentionally
make small mistakes and see what happens.
To help you devise your own action steps, Worksheet 7-20 contains some examples for each
problematic life-lens. But don’t let our list stiﬂe your own creativity. Be adventurous and
take risks.

Managing Mindfulness and

In This Chapter
 Taking your thoughts less seriously
 Embracing your feelings
 Staying connected to the present
S
it quietly for a few moments and pay attention to your breathing. Feel the air as it passes
through your nostrils and slowly ﬁlls your lungs. Experience the sensation of your lungs
deﬂating as you exhale. If thoughts come into your mind, notice them as an observer and
allow them to pass through. Go back to focusing on your breathing.
This breathing exercise is designed to introduce you to mindfulness. Mindfulness is a state
of awareness of the present in the absence of judgment, analysis, and reasoning. In other
words, it’s awareness without dwelling on your thinking. (That’s why we think the term
mindfulness really ought to be “mindlessness,” but alas, the world has adopted the term
“mindfulness,” so we’ll go along with that.) You can’t achieve mindfulness without accept-
ance, which involves patience and tolerance as well as willingness to feel and experience
“what is” without resistance. In this chapter, we guide you through the acceptance of your
thoughts and feelings so that you can achieve mindfulness.
Start by Losing Your Mind!
You aren’t the same as your mind. What’s that? Confused? You may be thinking, “These
authors sound like the ones who are losing their minds. This sounds like ﬂakey hogwash!”
It’s perfectly okay with us if you wish to think that, but how about you play along with us for
a few moments more and work through the next few sections?
Distinguishing between observing and evaluating
Sit back and wait for a thought to enter your mind. Don’t rush it; we’re sure one will come
along pretty soon. When it does, ask yourself this question: Who noticed that thought? The
obvious answer is you. The you that observes, breathes, and experiences isn’t the same
thing as your thoughts or your mind.

The following exercise helps you connect with the mindful, observant you by ﬁrst demon-
strating the ease with which you can slip into thoughts that come from an overly evaluative,
judgmental state of mind.
As we sit in our ofﬁce working on this chapter, we’re connecting with our evaluative, judg-
mental minds. In this exercise, our job is to criticize everything we see. Therefore, we make
the following critical thoughts and judgments about our surroundings:
 Papers are piled and stacked everywhere. What a disastrous mess!
 Who could ever work around this place?
 How could anyone type endlessly on a keyboard like this one that’s tethered in one spot?
 How many glasses and cups are we going to accumulate before one of us ﬁnally breaks
down and takes them to the kitchen?
 That picture on the wall of the memorial at the University of Kansas is wrinkled and
warped.
 Look at this mess of computer wires under the desk. It looks like a snake pit.
 There are way too many books on the shelves — and just look at all that dust on them!
 See that basket full of last year’s tax records? When are we ever going to ﬁle them away?
 With all this chaos, we’ll never be able to ﬁnish this ^*!&*%#^@! book!
We found this exercise quite simple to do because we, like everyone else, easily slip into
judgmental, critical states of mind. The more difﬁcult task is to access the observing, non-
evaluative you — in other words, to merely look at and experience what’s around you.
Here’s what we experience when we’re being mindful:
Right now, we can hear birds chirping outside, a ﬂy let in through an open door buzzing
around the room, and in the background, the sound of the dryer warning us that the laundry
is ready. We see papers piled in stacks of varying heights, the ﬂat computer screen, smooth-
ﬁnished wood desks and shelves, a telephone, and the dogs napping on the ﬂoor. We see
black and white wires entangled underneath the desk in patterns. We feel the plastic keys 
of the keyboard, the textured fabric of our chairs, slick paper lying on the desk, and a cold
glass of iced tea. We also feel our breath as it gently goes in and out.
After the ﬁrst, judgmental look at our present moment, we felt a little irritable, overwhelmed,
and discouraged. When we simply allowed ourselves to experience what was in front of us
without evaluation, we felt relaxed. The tasks at hand seemed less daunting. We pulled back
from self-disparagement and soon found ourselves absorbed by our writing.
Do this three-part exercise right now. Don’t let thoughts like “This is stupid,” “What can this
do for me?,” or “I’ll do this when I have more time” get in your way. Follow these instruc-
tions to complete Worksheet 8-1. Then move on to Worksheets 8-2 and 8-3.
1. Sit and look at everything around you.
2. Find something negative in everything you see.

Tuning in and tuning out mind chatter
Depressed and anxious minds chatter constantly. And usually the chatter predicts, judges,
and evaluates in harsh or frightening ways. Think of part of your mind as a chatter machine
that produces a stream of toxic verbiage, including:
 I’m not good enough.
 I’m a terrible person.
 I’ll never make it.
 I don’t deserve good things.
 I’m a screw-up.
 I’ll fail if I try.
 I can’t do this.
 No one will like me.
 If I ask her out, she’ll reject me.
 Pretty soon, people will know I’m a phony.
 I’m going to fall apart.
 What if I get cancer?
 I might throw up.
 What if I cry?
Do you have thoughts like these? Tune into them using this exercise.
1. Listen to your mind chatter as it rumbles through your mind.
2. In the left-hand column of Worksheet 8-4, write down the comments that you hear
over and over.
3. Think of a good friend of yours. Change your mind chatter to a statement about 
your friend, and write that statement in the right-hand column. For example, change
“Pretty soon, people will know I’m a phony” to “Pretty soon, people will know you’re a
phony, Richard.” Or change “I’m a terrible person” to “You’re a terrible person, Richard.”

My Reﬂections
Consider treating yourself as well as your friend better, and stop being so mean to yourself.
When your mind chatters, remind yourself that you want to be a friend to yourself.
Playing with your mind chatter
In Chapters 5, 6, and 7, we show you how thoughts and beliefs that run through your mind
contribute to emotional distress. These thoughts are almost always distorted and built on a
foundation of sand (that is, they are based on ﬂimsy evidence or outright distortions). Flip
back to those chapters for a review of how you can wage war against unhelpful thoughts
and beliefs.
You can certainly wage war on your unhelpful thoughts, but sometimes a warrior needs a
break or a change in tactics. In this section, we ask you to change tactics and put down your
weapons. Instead of going to war, we show you how to disarm damaging thoughts with
humor. After all, it’s hard to be upset when you’re laughing. When you hear negative chatter,
thank your mind for having those thoughts. Tell your mind how creative it’s being (yes, this
involves more than a hint of sarcasm). Take a look at an example, and then have some fun
taking on your own thoughts.

Chapter 8: Managing Mindfulness and Achieving Acceptance

Joseph works as a correction ofﬁcer during the day and attends college at night. He hates
his job and hopes that getting a counseling degree will allow him to change careers. His
schedule is grueling, and at times he gets discouraged. He tracks his mind chatter and
notices three recurring thoughts. After reading about thanking his mind, he comes up with
the responses shown in Worksheet 8-6.

Try thanking your mind when you hear unhelpful mind chatter. If you take such chatter seri-
ously, it’s sure to drag you under. But if you play with the thoughts, you can take away their
power. Follow these instructions to complete the exercise in Worksheet 8-7, and then record
your overall reﬂections in Worksheet 8-8.
1. Pay attention to your negative mind chatter.
2. In the left-hand column, write down upsetting thoughts that you hear repeatedly.
3. In the right-hand column, write a playful response to your mind chatter machine.
Consider complimenting or thanking your mind.
Keep this exercise in mind when your mind starts to chatter. Thank your mind for those
thoughts, and smile!

Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

Just for fun, consider trying out some other ways of playing with your mind’s chatter. Try
singing the negative thoughts to the tune of “Happy Birthday to You” or “Row, Row, Row
Your Boat.” You can also speak the thoughts out loud in a different voice — how’s your
Homer Simpson impression? Or how about Donald Duck? When you sing or say your self-
downing thoughts in a humorous manner, it’s much harder to take them seriously.
Worksheet 8-8
My Reﬂections
Arriving at Acceptance
Once or twice each winter, we take a drive up to the crest of New Mexico’s Sandia Mountains,
elevation 10,000 feet. We like to tromp around in the snow and sometimes go cross-country
skiing. We bring our dogs, and they appear to love the snow more than we do.
The parking lot at the crest is usually plowed, but the last time we went, we managed to get
stuck in a snowbank. I mean really stuck. As the wheels began spinning uselessly, I (Charles)
uttered a few choice words of frustration. Laura reminded me that we had written about this
very subject (getting stuck in the snow) in our last book, Depression For Dummies. She said,
“Remember, you have to accept where you’re at to get where you want to go.”
So, I took my foot off the accelerator and allowed the car to rock back. I gently applied the
gas again until the tires started to spin, and once again, I took my foot off the accelerator. I
continued rocking the car until we ﬁnally escaped from the snow.
No, this isn’t a lesson in how to extract your car from a snowbank. Rather, the message here
is that in order to move forward, it’s important to ease up and accept where you’re at for a
moment. When the time is right, you can gently push ahead.
Are you wondering what acceptance has to do with anxiety and depression? Well, everyone
feels anxious or sad now and then. Recognizing and accepting those feelings is important
because if you absolutely can’t stand to be worried or down, then you’ll inevitably feel more
upset when you experience these normal feelings. In other words, you get more upset and
distressed about getting distressed. That’s clearly not very helpful.
Don’t get us wrong; we want you to feel good most of the time. But as far as we know, the
only humans who don’t feel some anxiety or sadness are, well . . . dead. Besides, if you don’t
know sadness, it’s difﬁcult to know what happiness is. Without worry, you wouldn’t appreci-
ate calm. Accept a certain degree of difﬁcult emotions as part of your life.
One way to accept a few negative feelings is to view them objectively. Imagine that you’re
writing a report on the experience of anxiety or depression. To accurately express the expe-
rience, you need to acquire a dispassionate understanding of the essence of your emotions.
In other words, observe and accept your feelings without judgment. As you do, you’ll likely
123
Chapter 8: Managing Mindfulness and Achieving Acceptance

see that your distress lessens. Whether you’re depressed or anxious, accepting the emo-
tional angst dispassionately will help you handle your bad feelings without becoming more
upset. Read through the following example, and try out the exercise when you’re feeling
troubled.
Kelsey needs to renew her driver’s license, so she runs over to the Motor Vehicles Depart-
ment on her lunch hour. Although there’s only one clerk on duty, she’s pleased to see only
four people ahead of her. Then, the man at the front of the line starts arguing with the clerk.
The argument continues, and the supervisor is summoned. As the discussion at the front of
the line drags on, Kelsey looks at her watch and starts to worry about getting back to work
on time. She recalls the Accepting Angst Dispassionately exercise (see Worksheet 8-9) and
runs through it in her mind.
Worksheet 8-9
Accepting Angst Dispassionately
1. Write about your current physical feelings. Is your stomach upset? Are you sweat-
ing? Is your heart pounding? Do your shoulders feel tight? Describe everything
going on in your body in objective terms.
Huh, I’m jiggling and rocking back and forth. I can feel the tension in my shoul-
ders. My breathing is becoming fast and shallow. My heart is even starting to
race. How interesting.
2. Notice ﬂuctuations in these physical feelings. Over time, feelings vary in intensity.
Are the waves long or short? How high do they go at their peaks and how low at
their ebbs?
Now that I’m paying attention, I can see that these feelings go up and down
every few minutes; they aren’t constant. As I’m observing them, they actually
seem to be lessening.
3. Predict how long you will have these physical feelings. An hour, a minute, a day, 
a year?
They probably won’t last more than however long I’m here.
4. Notice with dispassion the thoughts that go through your mind. Imagine those
thoughts ﬂoating away on clouds. Write them down and say goodbye as they ﬂoat
away.
It’s interesting to notice my thoughts. I’m thinking things like, “I’m going to be late
and that’s horrible,” and “That stupid man; who does he think he is anyway?” It’s
funny, but as I listen to these thoughts objectively, they don’t seem so important.
5. Predict how long you will have these thoughts. An hour, a minute, a day, a year?
They’re already ﬂoating away as I zero in on them.
The next time you notice unpleasant feelings, work through the exercise in Worksheet 8-10.
If you happen to have this book in front of you at the time, write your reactions down imme-
diately. If you don’t have your workbook on hand, recall as many of these questions as you
can and answer them in your mind. The main goal is simply to adopt an objective perspec-
tive that describes your feeling without judging it.

The point of this exercise is to accept the way you feel in the moment without jumping to
evaluation or judgment. Think of yourself as a scientist interested in objective observation
and description. This exercise is particularly useful when you ﬁnd yourself in frustrating,
unavoidable predicaments, such as
 Being stuck in a trafﬁc jam.
 Waiting in long lines.
 Sitting through boring meetings.
 Moving through crowds.
 Suffering through travel delays.
125

 Waiting for someone who’s late.
 Meeting a deadline.
 Getting rejected.
 Receiving criticism.
 Feeling afraid.
 Taking a risk such as giving a speech.
 Getting sick.
Connecting with Now
People have the rather curious habit of allowing their thoughts to dwell on the past or the
future. In the process, they make themselves miserable. If you really think about it, most of
what you get unhappy or worried about has to do with events that happened in the past or
are yet to occur. You feel guilty about past transgressions and worry about future calamities.
When you spend too much time in the past or future, you’re bound to ruin your present.
You lose the enjoyment and pleasure you may otherwise feel about the present. Rarely is
the present as miserable as your memories or predictions.
For example, we have a great dog named Murphy. She’s a Wheaton Terrier (looks like a little
sheep dog). Murphy loves to ride in the car. What’s odd is that most of the time she’s in 
the car, we’re taking her to the groomer. Murphy hates the groomer — as in really hates the
groomer. Nevertheless, every time we open the car door, she eagerly bounds in and enthusi-
astically sticks her head out the window to enjoy the wind. When we arrive at the groomer’s
shop, she gleefully jumps out of the car, hoping to go for a walk. About 20 feet from the door,
however, she sees where she’s going and promptly plops down on the parking lot pavement.
She refuses to move, so we end up carrying her in.
If Murphy were a person, she’d mark her calendar with her grooming dates and then worry
and obsess about the appointment for days, if not weeks, ahead of time. She certainly would
not enjoy the car ride — like how you miss your present because you’re focusing on the past
or future — and all those enjoyable moments would be lost.
The exercise laid out in Worksheet 8-11 facilitates becoming more now- or present-focused.
Practice it for four or ﬁve minutes during your day; you can do it almost anywhere. This
exercise will refresh you. (Some people need to use a stopwatch or timer because the ﬁve-
minute rule is hard to follow at ﬁrst, but it’ll become easier as your practice becomes
routine.)
Worksheet 8-11
Embracing Present Moments
1. Sit comfortably in a chair or on the ﬂoor. (Location doesn’t matter as long as you’re
comfortable.)
2. Extend your legs and place your feet about shoulder width apart.
3. Put your hand on your abdomen and feel your breath go in and out. Take your time
breathing, keep it low and slow.
4. When you feel comfortable, close your eyes. Continue to think about your breathing.
126
Part II: Thinking About Thinking: Thought Therapy 

5. When thoughts intrude, let them be. Notice them and watch them ﬂoat away. Just
keep breathing — low and slow.
6. Sit quietly. When you ﬁrst start this practice, you may feel an urge to scratch some
part of your body. When that sensation occurs, concentrate mentally on the area and
the desire is likely to pass.
7. Remain for just ﬁve minutes of stillness. If you feel a muscle tensing, send your mental
effort to that area. Study the feeling, and it will pass.
Five quiet minutes is all it takes to become mindful of the present. Follow the steps above,
and then take a few moments to reﬂect in Worksheet 8-12 on how you felt.
Worksheet 8-12
My Reﬂections
Almost any activity can be carried out mindfully, connecting only with the activity itself
without judgment, evaluation, or analysis. For example, eating is an activity that occurs
often and thus gives you numerous opportunities for practicing mindfulness. Relatively 
few present moments elicit high distress, and mindfulness connects you with the present.
Mindful connection with the present takes some practice, so don’t rush the process or
judge your success or failure. Instead, simply practice, practice, practice.
Try this mindfulness exercise at any meal (see Worksheet 8-13). You’ll ﬁnd yourself slowing
down and enjoying your food more than before. In fact, people who eat mindfully typically
lose weight more easily (if that’s what they’re trying to do) because they’re no longer eating
to rid themselves of unpleasant feelings. After you work through the steps, record your
reﬂections in Worksheet 8-14.
Worksheet 8-13
Eating Mindfully
1. Look at what you’re about to eat. What colors are in front of you? Are they shiny or
dull? What does the texture look like? Is it smooth, rough, or varied?
2. Smell the food. Does it smell sweet, garlicky, ﬁshy, pungent, or something else?
3. Take a small piece of food and place it on your tongue. What does it feel like?
4. Gently, slowly, move the piece around your mouth. Are you salivating? Does this food
need to be chewed?
5. As you chew, note the different tastes and textures that are released.
6. As the food begins to break down, feel it as it gets close to the back of your throat.
Swallow.
7. Start again with the next piece of food.

Chapter 9
Facing Feelings: Avoiding Avoidance
In This Chapter
 Figuring out your fears
 Facing fear one step at a time
 Plowing through obsessions and compulsions
T
his chapter is all about fear and anxiety. We know what you’re thinking — this book is
supposed to be about both anxiety and depression; so what does fear have to do with
depression? Well, quite a lot actually. Fear is connected to anxiety, and anxiety, especially
chronic anxiety, frequently leads to depression. And if you’re already depressed, anxiety is
likely to deepen your depression.
If you experience fear and anxiety, you probably avoid the things that make you feel uneasy.
For example, if you’re dreadfully afraid of snakes, you probably don’t hang out in swamps.
Or if crowds make you nervous — really nervous, that is — you likely avoid the shopping
mall during the holidays. So what’s wrong with that?
The problem is that avoidance increases or intensiﬁes anxiety. When you make the decision
to avoid something you fear, you instantly feel relief, and relief feels pretty good. In a sense,
you’ve rewarded yourself for avoidance. People tend to do things more often when they’re
rewarded; therefore, you’re more likely to avoid again. In fact, you’ll probably ﬁnd yourself
avoiding more frequently and in response to other, somewhat similar events.
If crowds make you really nervous, you may start out avoiding only huge crowds. That avoid-
ance feels pretty good until smaller crowds start making you nervous, too. So you avoid
smaller and smaller crowds, and your avoidance continues to grow until you’re barely able
to get yourself out of your house, lest you run into even a few people.
In this chapter, we give you a list of common anxieties and fears that people commonly
experience so that you can identify the ones that cause you the most distress and choose
one to battle. We show you how to break your fear into manageable pieces, guiding you up
the Staircase of Fear, one step at a time. Don’t worry; you can do it! Finally, we review a spe-
cial type of anxiety known as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and explain its treatment,
which is similar to the treatment of other anxieties and fears but with a few special modiﬁ-
cations.
What, Me Worry?
Most people have at least a few minor worries or anxieties, and that’s no big deal. A little
anxiety prepares you for action. When the guy in the car in front of you slams on his brakes,
the sudden anxiety you feel helps your body to respond quickly — and that’s a good thing.

But when fears and worries start dominating your life, you probably want to take action.
The ﬁrst step in doing so involves ﬁguring out exactly what makes you anxious. Go through
our 50 Fears Checklist in Worksheet 9-1 and check off each item that causes you signiﬁcant
concern.

If a few of your top fears don’t seriously interfere with your life, you may decide simply to
live with them — and that’s okay! For example, Laura (co-author of this book) has no inten-
tion of doing anything about her silly fear of bugs. It doesn’t prevent her from enjoying the
outdoors or life in general, and she always has Charles (the other co-author) around to get
rid of them if they appear. If all else fails, 15 tissues provide enough of a barrier between her
and any bugs as to enable her to muster the courage to eliminate them.
133
Chapter 9: Facing Feelings: Avoiding Avoidance

Building a Staircase of Fear
Pick a fear, any fear. Well, maybe not any fear — it should be one that bothers you and that
you’d like to do something about (it’s probably from your Top Five Fears list; see Worksheet
9-2). The best way to overcome fear is to face it dead-on. Not all at once, mind you, but 
in steps.
The exposure technique for facing and overcoming fear involves breaking your fear into
manageable steps and gradually confronting each one. You don’t proceed to the next step
until you’ve conquered the one you started with. You’ll know you’ve mastered a given step
when you can repeat the step without getting overly anxious.
Exposure can be carried out both in real life and in your imagination. Some fearful events
aren’t easy to arrange, such as fear of being laughed at or humiliated, but they’re easily
imagined. Typically, imagining such events doesn’t involve quite as much anxiety as actually
experiencing them; however, most people can reduce their anxiety by repeatedly imagining
fearful events.
Identifying your fears
The ﬁrst stage of the exposure technique involves zeroing in on your fear and where it comes
from. You construct a staircase that takes you from fear and anxiety to a better place. Your
staircase consists of all the situations and activities that evoke your fear. Tackling your fear
involves climbing this staircase, starting with the easiest steps and progressively getting a
little more difﬁcult. When constructing your staircase, it’s important not to make your steps
too far apart or you may end up scaring yourself.
You get a pretty nice view from the top, but don’t be surprised if the climb challenges you.
Just take your time, and use the following example as a guide.
Jason is painfully shy, especially when it comes to women and dating. He has a number of
good male friends but trembles at the thought of asking someone out. He tries online match-
making and ﬁnds that engaging in conversations via e-mail is pretty easy. But he stops short
of setting up a face-to-face meeting for fear of rejection. Jason vows to overcome this fear on
his 30th birthday. His ﬁrst step is to work through the Gathering Materials for the Staircase
of Fear (see Worksheet 9-3).
Worksheet 9-3
Gathering Materials for Jason’s Staircase of Fear
1. How does your anxiety or fear begin?
The mere image of picking up the phone to ask someone out scares me to
death. Even when I’m conversing with women, my anxiety can get triggered.
Gosh, I get nervous when I talk to a good-looking clerk at the grocery store.
2. What activities do you avoid?
Obviously, I haven’t had a date in a long time. I avoid going to parties. I avoid
talking to available women. I avoid calling them on the phone. I even avoid the
staff lunchroom with the excuse that I have too much work to do. My shyness
seems to be getting worse, and lately I’m avoiding meeting and talking with new
people, even guys.
134
Part III: Actions Against Angst: Behavior Therapy 

3. What other situations or activities could your fear conceivably involve?
The whole relationship thing worries me. If I did get a date, I wouldn’t know what
to do or what to say. And I wouldn’t know when to make an advance — that’s
really scary. The one brief relationship I had in college really hurt me, so I worry
that if I were to ﬁnd someone, she’d just reject me, too. Heck, I can hardly even
ask for directions from a woman.
4. Do you use any “crutches” or aids to get through what makes you anxious, such as
drugs or alcohol? Do you lean on other people to do what’s too hard for you to do?
Do you try to distract yourself with songs, rituals, or chants?
I have a prescription for a tranquilizer. I take one of those sometimes before I
have to talk with a woman. At work I avoid committees and meetings and let my
co-workers cover for me.
5. What bad outcomes do you envision occuring if you were to face your fear? In other
words, what are the worst imaginable scenarios?
If I try to ask someone out, I imagine my voice shaking and not being able to
speak. I would look like a fool. My stomach would churn, and I’d sweat like a pig.
And if I did go out on a date, she’d probably laugh in my face or walk away
before the evening was over. If someone was dumb enough to go out with me
more than once, she’d no doubt break my heart.
After Jason completes the questions for Gathering Materials for the Staircase of Fear, he
moves on to the next step, which helps him arrange his materials according to how much
fear they cause (see Worksheet 9-4). He reviews what he wrote in Worksheet 9-3 and uses
that information to identify speciﬁc activities that he fears carrying out. He rates each activ-
ity on a scale of 0 (no fear) to 100 (worst imaginable fear). Jason takes care to come up with
items that cover the full range of fear, from little fear to overwhelming fear and everything in
between.

between 25 and 55), try to think of some more items to ﬁll in the gaps — you don’t
want to make too large of a step all at once.

Surveying sample staircases of fear
Everyone’s fears and worries are a little different, but they frequently have much in common
as well. Therefore, it may help you to see a variety of staircases that are typical of many of
the clients we’ve seen. These samples cover many of the major types of anxiety. They can
help you get started, but remember that your own staircase is unique to you.

Lydia worries all the time. She frets about her family, friends, ﬁnances, and even her ﬁgure.
She particularly worries about traveling and having enough money saved. So when she has
a trip planned, she packs weeks in advance and repeatedly calls for reservation reconﬁr-
mation. She also balks at making reasonable purchases that are well within her means.
Furthermore, she worries about her husband’s love. Thus, anxiety drains enjoyment from
Lydia’s life. Worksheet 9-8 shows her Staircase of Fear.

Lydia’s Staircase of Fear
Larry is scared to death of ﬂying. Forced to ﬂy for business, he’s so anxious that he has
three drinks at the airport bar before he boards. After he’s on the plane, he has three more
drinks and can barely walk off the plane when it lands. Watching the bags go around and
around on the baggage claim belt makes him nauseous.
The next morning, Larry suffers through a board meeting with his head pounding and his
stomach churning. A ﬁstful of aspirin and frequent trips to the bathroom convince him that
he has a problem. He vows to ﬁnd a better way to deal with his ﬂying phobia. Worksheet 9-9
shows his Staircase of Fear.
Christopher suffers from panic attacks and a fear of crowds. His panic attacks consist of
sweating, rapid heartbeat, and a horrible tightness in his chest. When an attack occurs,
Christopher feels like he may be dying. Christopher stays away from crowded places. He
shops for groceries late at night when few people are around, and he makes all other pur-
chases on the Internet so that he can avoid shopping malls. He feels worst in places in
which he thinks he may have trouble escaping, such as crowded movie theaters. Worksheet
9-10 shows Christopher’s Staircase of Fear.
If your anxiety includes signiﬁcant physical symptoms such as difﬁculty breathing and
changes in heart rate, you should consult with your medical doctor prior to treating the
anxiety on your own or even with a counselor or therapist.

Creating your own Staircase of Fear
Now comes the fun part . . . well, maybe not fun, but eye-opening for sure. Using the infor-
mation you’ve recorded and the samples in the previous section as a guide, you can build
your Staircase of Fear.
1. Review the fearful activities you listed in Worksheet 9-7.
2. Pick the least feared item and write it in the bottom step of Worksheet 9-11.
3. Continue ﬁlling in Worksheet 9-11, writing activities in the order of the degree of
fear they carry.
Try to make your steps reasonably evenly spaced in terms of the amount of fear involved.
Thus, if you rate one step a 25, your next step ideally should have a ranking of 30 to 35. If
you don’t have such a step, try to think of one.
Some of your steps may involve using your imagination. For example, if your fear involves
getting ill, we don’t particularly advise you expose yourself to deadly viruses. But you cer-
tainly can conjure up an image of getting ill in your mind.

If you ﬁnd that developing or climbing a Staircase of Fear is so difﬁcult that you just can’t
make progress on your own, consult a mental health professional.

Climbing Your Staircase
After you develop your ﬁrst Staircase of Fear (see the previous section), it’s time to face
your fear directly. Oh my gosh! This could be kind of hard, huh? It will be hard, but if you
take care to focus on each step as it comes and climb slowly, you’re likely to succeed.
Take the steps as slowly as you need to. Remember, if you ﬁnd the process too difﬁcult, 
consult a mental health professional. You don’t have to go this alone.
Jump back up to the section “Identifying your fears” and review Jason’s story. He’s afraid 
to talk to or date women. After constructing his Staircase of Fear, Jason’s ready for the ﬁrst
step in confronting his fear, which requires him to talk to a female sales clerk. (That task is
lowest on his list — that is, it carries the lowest fear rating — so it’s the ﬁrst task Jason
takes on.)
Jason takes a trip to the mall and spots an attractive female sales clerk. His anxiety rockets,
so he practices a breathing and relaxation technique. After he feels a little calmer, Jason
approaches the clerk and asks for directions to customer service. Because he feels pretty
anxious during this brief conversation, he knows he needs to repeat this step a number of
times before he’s ready to move on to the next step in his staircase.
Jason spends much of the afternoon in the mall going from one clerk to another in various
stores. By the end of the day, he chats easily with a clerk and feels only a fraction of his pre-
vious anxiety. Jason knows he needs to continue with this step, but he’s also ready to take
on the next one. Slowly but surely, he climbs to the top of his Staircase of Fear.
Jason tracks his progress in the Climb to the Top Exercise shown in Worksheet 9-12. After
each attempt at a fearful activity, he records how much anxiety he experiences and jots
down his thoughts. He repeats the activity until his anxiety decreases by at least 50 percent,
and then he moves to the next step.

I need to keep on practicing, but I think I
can handle the next step in the meantime.
As you can see, the ﬁrst time Jason carried out an activity, his anxiety wasn’t always at the
level he had expected on his Staircase of Fear (see Worksheet 9-5). As he repeated the activ-
ities, his anxiety went up and down but generally tended downward.
Before you begin exposure, or what we call climbing the staircase, it’s a good idea to start
out in a reasonably relaxed state. To help you achieve this state, here’s a brief breathing
exercise. Practicing this breathing technique gives you a quick way of managing anxiety if it
crops up and climbs excessively. (If you want more instructions on learning to relax, see
Chapter 13.)
1. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose.
2. Hold your breath for a few seconds.
3. Breathe out very slowly through your mouth.
4. As you breathe out, make a slight hissing sound.
5. Repeat ten times.
Now, the hard part — climbing your Staircase of Fear.
1. In the left-hand column of Worksheet 9-13, write down the activities from your
Staircase of Fear (see Worksheet 9-11) in order of difﬁculty, with the easiest, least
fearful items listed ﬁrst.
2. Do the ﬁrst activity listed, and carefully observe how you feel. If the item involves 
an imaginary scene, ﬁnd a comfortable place to sit and relax. Lie back, close your eyes,
and picture the feared item as though it were occurring. Stay with the image as long as
it takes for your fear to diminish at least 50 percent.
3. In the right-hand column of Worksheet 9-13, rate how anxious the activity or
imagery makes you feel on a scale of 0 (no anxiety) to 100 (terrifying). Include any
interesting reactions or observations.
4. Repeat each activity and rate each repetition until your anxiety has dropped by
around 50 percent. If your anxiety remains high, try the breathing technique for a
minute or two. If the breathing technique doesn’t calm you down, consider backing
away from the activity and try to break it down into more manageable steps.
5. Move on to the next, more difﬁcult activity when your anxiety has dropped and you
feel you have mastered the preceding item.
6. When you complete the climb of your Staircase of Fear, take a few moments to
reﬂect on the experience and what it’s meant to you in Worksheet 9-14.

If you ﬁnd the task of climbing your staircase daunting, turn to the following helpful sugges-
tions for making your climb successful.
 Consider asking a trusted friend or family member to accompany you on your ﬁrst
attempt at difﬁcult activities. Just be sure to carry out the task by yourself later.
 Don’t give in to mind chatter such as, “I can’t do this,” “This is stupid,” “I’ll look like a
fool,” or “This exercise won’t help!” Thoughts like these are merely thoughts, nothing
more. Notice how interesting this mind chatter is, but don’t be seduced into believing
it. (See Chapter 8 for more about dealing with mind chatter.)
 Consider rewarding yourself for the successful completion of any difﬁcult steps. Treat
yourself to something special — you deserve it!
 Allow yourself to feel some discomfort. After all, this work is difﬁcult. It’s okay to feel anx-
ious at times — that shows you’re making progress. Just don’t forget, “no pain, no gain.”
144
Part III: Actions Against Angst: Behavior Therapy 

 Tell yourself that you can overcome your fears. Be positive. Beating your fears may
take some time, but you can do it.
 Don’t use crutches such as alcohol or excessive medication to get through steps.
Crutches diminish the effectiveness of exposure. Try not to distract yourself with
chants, songs, or other rituals, either.
 Climb those stairs slowly. Exposure takes time, and this isn’t a race!

My Reﬂections
If you ﬁnd yourself avoiding this exposure part of the program, we suggest you ﬂip back to
Chapter 3, which discusses ways of identifying and overcoming roadblocks to change.
Exposing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) poses a somewhat greater challenge than the anxieties
we discuss earlier in this chapter. OCD frustrates and challenges those afﬂicted as well as
their loved ones. Not only does OCD cause considerable emotional discomfort, it also con-
sumes a considerable amount of time.
Essentially, obsessions are unwanted images, impulses, or thoughts that ﬂood the mind. These
thoughts may take the form of excessive worry about contamination by germs, chemicals,
radiation, and so on. Other obsessions include concerns about whether doors were left
unlocked or appliances were turned off. Additional obsessions common to OCD include
impulses to hurt someone you love, engage in shameful sexual behaviors, violate your per-
sonal religious beliefs, or act in socially unacceptable or highly strange ways.
Compulsions are undesired actions that people ﬁnd themselves doing over and over in order
to temporarily reduce anxiety. Common compulsions include excessive hand washing, over-
cleaning, hoarding objects, arranging objects in a particularly rigid manner, checking and
rechecking things (such as locks), and creating strict rituals such as counting stairs or put-
ting on clothing in the exact same order every day.
Lots of people experience a few minor obsessions or compulsions, and that’s no problem.
You don’t have a problem with OCD unless your repetitive thoughts and actions begin to
seriously infringe on your relationships, your work, or your sense of freedom. You can ﬁnd
considerably more information about this particular problem in Overcoming Anxiety For
Dummies (Wiley).
Obsessive-compulsive disorder can be a serious, debilitating problem, and most people
who suffer from OCD require professional help. You should only attempt the strategies that
follow if your problems are fairly mild; consider using this book in collaboration with your
therapist or counselor.
145
Chapter 9: Facing Feelings: Avoiding Avoidance

The approach for treating OCD is quite similar to the treatments for anxiety and fear reviewed
earlier in this chapter. However, as you can see in the following sections, there are a few
minor differences.
Beating obsessions
Because obsessions consist of thoughts or mental images, exposure for obsessions typically
takes place in the imagination. Also, imagination is the best approach because many obses-
sions really couldn’t or shouldn’t be acted out. For example, if your obsession involves
strange sexual perversions, we don’t recommend that you “expose” yourself to them!
In fact, if you have obsessions that involve unacceptable sexual activities or physically hurt-
ing yourself or others, you should consult a mental health professional rather than attempt
imaginal or real exposure techniques.
Most obsessions are focused on a single idea, so you may not have a Staircase of Fear to
climb. However, you can still utilize exposure to help you deal with many different obses-
sions. Proceed by answering the questions posed in Worksheet 9-15.
Worksheet 9-15
Obsessional Exposure
1. Write down your distressing, obsessional thought or image.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
2. Rank how upsetting the thought or image is to you on a scale of 0 (no upset) to 100.
________
3. Find a comfortable, private place to sit and work through this procedure.
4. Repeat the thought or image over and over and over and over and over and over
and over and over and over and over and over (oops, we’re getting a tad compulsive
here aren’t we?).
5. Continue repeating the thought or image for 20 to 30 minutes or as long as it takes
to reduce your level of upset (in Step 2) by at least 10 to 20 points.
6. Re-rate your thought or image on the same scale (0 [no upset] to 100 [totally 
disturbing]). ______
The act of exposing oneself to obsessional thoughts and images is quite the opposite of
what people with OCD usually try to do. They often try to immediately expunge obsessive
thoughts and images from their minds when they occur. The problem with that approach is
that attempting to suppress thoughts only makes them surface more frequently.
For example, try not thinking about purple elephants. Don’t even begin to let an image of a
purple elephant come into your mind! We may even pay you $1 million if you can keep even
a momentary image of a PURPLE ELEPHANT from coming into your mind. See, it’s not so
easy, is it?
146
Part III: Actions Against Angst: Behavior Therapy 

Treating compulsions
Treating compulsions, like the treatment of other anxieties and fears, involves exposure as
the ﬁrst step. You gather materials for a Staircase of Fear, arrange your materials into an
actual staircase, and start your climb. The only difference in the treatment of compulsions
is that you have to do one extra thing: Not only do you expose yourself to the problematic
activities or items, but you also must stop yourself from engaging in the compulsive behav-
ior. The technical name for this procedure is exposure and response prevention. The following
example shows you how this treatment procedure works for a particular compulsion.
Gina has a common compulsion — washing her hands . . . a lot. In fact, altogether, she
spends about three hours a day washing her hands. She does this because she fears coming
in contact with germs and becoming ill. However, the compulsion is ruining her life by unnec-
essarily taking up huge amounts of time. Not to mention that her hands are raw and oozing.
Gina gathers and arranges materials as well as constructs her Staircase of Fear. In Worksheet
9-16, you see the partial results of her Climb to the Top Exercise, her repeated exposures 
to problematic events and activities while not washing her hands. In fact, Gina makes a con-
certed effort not to wash for at least an hour after the exposure.

Chapter 9: Facing Feelings: Avoiding Avoidance

In addition to climbing your Staircase of Fear while preventing the compulsive behavior,
consider
 Delaying your urges by 30 minutes each time you have them. Later, you can delay for
45 minutes.
 Changing your compulsion in various ways. You may use different soap, arrange things
a little differently, or make a slight change in your routine.

OCD problems. In Worksheet 9-17, record your thoughts and insights.

 Finding motivation to stick with the program
W
hy devote a whole chapter to exercise in a book that deals with anxiety and depres-
sion? Well, because getting up and moving increases the naturally occurring feel-good
endorphins in the human body. When endorphins, substances occurring naturally in the
brain that are chemically similar to morphine, spread through your brain, you get a sense of
well-being and pleasure. And it’s hard to be depressed or anxious when you feel good inside.
In this chapter, we tell you how much exercise you need to get those endorphins going, and
we tell you about all the known beneﬁts of exercise. You pick your top ten reasons for begin-
ning or sticking with an exercise program and then ﬁgure out an exercise plan that ﬁts your
lifestyle. We also offer some tips for ﬁnding the motivation to keep exercise going in your life.
How Much Is Enough?
The best time to get into an exercise habit is when you’re young because exercise helps to
keep you healthy throughout your life. However, it’s never too late to start — even 90-year-
olds beneﬁt from regular exercise!
If you’re in good health, it’s okay to start an exercise program on your own. However, for
men over 40, women over 50, and anyone with a chronic disease or other health concerns,
it’s best to check with a physician before beginning a vigorous exercise regimen.
Every ﬁve years, the United States government updates its guidelines for nutrition and exer-
cise. The 2005 recommendations signiﬁcantly increased the recommended amount of time
for healthy people to engage in vigorous physical activity. So what do the current guidelines
recommend? Take a deep breath and relax. Here they are:
 Children should be physically active about an hour a day on most days. Activities can
include vigorous play, dance, or organized sports.
 Adolescents should engage in at least 60 minutes of exercise every day, most days of
the week.
 Healthy adults should be physically active for at least 30 minutes per day.

 If you’re trying to prevent the gradual weight gain associated with normal aging, exer-
cise should be increased to an hour of vigorous activity per day most days of the week.
 If you want to lose weight, you should exercise between 60 and 90 minutes on most
days.
 Most pregnant women should be exercising 30 minutes per day. (Check with your
doctor to make sure this recommendation’s right for you.)
Write down here how many minutes a day you should be exercising: ____________________
The point of exercise is to improve physical ﬁtness. Fitness consists of the following:
 Cardiorespiratory endurance: Your body’s ability to pump blood and circulate oxygen,
which is improved by elevating your heart rate safely for increasing periods of time.
 Body composition: Your body’s ratio of fat and lean mass, which is improved by all
types of exercise.
 Flexibility: Your body’s ability to move ﬂuidly and with good range, which is improved
by stretching or activities such as swimming.
 Muscular strength: Your body’s ability to lift and push, which is improved largely
through weight training.
 Muscular endurance: Your body’s ability to sustain effort without getting tired, which
is also improved by all kinds of exercise.
The Case for Health Improvement
Hold on. The U.S. government gives you guidelines about what you should do exercise-wise,
but what’s with all the shoulds? In Chapter 5, we told you to stop “shoulding” on yourself.
Now, we’re telling you that you should exercise. Are we just trying to make you feel guilty?
No, not really. In fact, we’d be defeating our own purpose if you started feeling guilty!
However, we believe that exercise has so many beneﬁts that everyone physically capable of
moving around would feel better if they just did it. So this section covers the many good
things that can happen — as well as the bad things that can be prevented — when you exer-
cise. You may ﬁnd a few of these items surprising, but they’re all 100 percent true and well
documented.
You didn’t think you’d get away with just reading a list of reasons for exercise, did you?
Follow the instructions here in order to identify the ten reasons you should be exercising.
1. Read through the items in Worksheet 10-1. If the item is something that you’re con-
cerned about, check it off. Some items may be relevant to just about everyone; others
may be particularly important to you. For example, if you have a family history of dia-
betes or colon cancer, those items may be especially important and make it on your
top ten list.
2. When you ﬁnish checking off the items that pertain to you, spend a few moments
deciding which ones are the most important and relevant to you.
3. Pick your top ten reasons for exercising, and record them in Worksheet 10-2.

Fitting Exercise into Your Life
You may have some pretty good reasons for exercising now, but wow, 30 to 90 minutes —
where will you ﬁnd the time? You’re probably way too busy as it is. We know, we know — we
can almost hear those thoughts running through your head.
First of all, you don’t have to ﬁnd one big window of time for exercise. The government guide-
lines state that it’s just as useful to do your exercise in 10- or 15-minute segments. What
matters is the total accumulation per day. And it may help you to know that exercise con-
sists of just about any type of activity that occurs at a moderate level of intensity. Moderate
intensity means that you’re increasing your breathing and heart rate, which you can do by
mowing the lawn, dancing, swimming, bike riding, jogging, or even walking at a rapid pace.
Thus, if your job is physically demanding, you may already be getting sufﬁcient exercise
every day. On the other hand, if you religiously take your dogs on a leisurely walk every
morning for 45 minutes, that probably won’t do the trick — you need to pick up your pace
because anything done leisurely just doesn’t cut it.
Everyone is different. People have different schedules, habits, preferences, and lifestyles.
Therefore, an exercise program that works for one person may not work for another. The
following instructions and checklist in Worksheet 10-3 are designed to help you choose
exercise that will work into your life.
1. Read through Worksheet 10-3, checking off all the exercise ideas that could conceiv-
ably become part of your routine.
2. Add a few possibilities of your own at the bottom of the list.
3. Try each and every activity you select at least a couple of times.
4. Jot down your feelings and reactions under My Reﬂections (see Worksheet 10-4).
Include comments on how you think you can work these activities into your 
daily life.

Chapter 10: Lifting Mood Through Exercise

What to Do When Willpower Wilts
Working through the preceding section gives you some pretty good reasons for exercising
(ten, in fact!). And hopefully you’ve found a few types of exercise that just may ﬁt into your
life and have tried them out. Your intentions may be good, but what happens when your ini-
tial enthusiasm and commitment to do something positive for yourself fade? Or, how do you
get started if you haven’t found that initial enthusiasm?
Fighting de-motivating thoughts
The problem with ﬁnding and maintaining motivation to exercise lies in distorted, 
de-motivating thinking (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7 for more on distorted thinking). De-motivating
thinking keeps you from taking action and puts you in a defeatist frame of mind, where you’re
doomed to fail. When your thinking is distorted, your mind is full of reasons you can’t exercise.
It’s hard to get moving when demotivating thoughts take control. But we have a strategy 
for defeating defeatism. The following example gives you an idea of how you can give 
de-motivating thoughts the one-two punch.
Janine, a busy mother of two, works as a bank teller. She rushes off every morning to drop
her kids at day care and tries to ﬁt in her errands during a 45-minute lunch break. By dinner-
time, she’s usually exhausted. It’s no wonder Janine suffers from mild depression. When her
doctor suggests she begin exercising to improve her mood and health, Janine laughs and
says, “You’ve got to be kidding; I don’t have an extra second in my day.”
But fortunately for Janine, she has a copy of the Anxiety & Depression Workbook For
Dummies and completes the Defeating De-Motivating Thoughts exercise. Worksheet 10-5
shows what she comes up with, and Worksheet 10-6 has her reﬂections on the exercise.

Worksheet 10-6
Janine’s Reﬂections
I guess I can see how my thinking is bogging me down on this exercise thing.
Part of the reason I feel so down is because I haven’t been able to lose the
weight from my last baby. What I need to do is stop listening to all these
thoughts and just do it. I think I’ll ride my bike with the kids down to the library
tonight and check out an exercise tape.
Most folks who struggle to work exercise into their lives have thoughts like Janine’s. Just
because you think something, though, doesn’t mean it’s true. Therefore, paying attention 
to the dialogue about exercise that runs through your head is important because you can
argue with these thoughts and in turn increase your willingness and motivation to exercise.
To complete your own Defeating De-Motivating Thoughts Exercise,
1. Read the de-motivating thoughts in the left-hand column of Worksheet 10-7, and
circle those that are relevant to you. These are the most common thoughts people
have that get in the way of exercise.
If you have thoughts that aren’t on the list, feel free to add them in the extra spaces
provided.
2. For each thought that you circle or that you add, develop a motivating thought that
refutes and debunks the de-motivating one. Consider the following points in develop-
ing motivating thoughts:
• Is the de-motivating thought exaggerated or illogical in any way?
• Is the thought just an excuse not to exercise?
• Is there a better way to think about this de-motivating thought?
• If a friend of mine told me the thought, would I think it was completely legitimate,
or would it sound like an excuse?
• Is the thought helping me?
• What would happen if I simply tried acting as though the thought weren’t true?
If you struggle to come up with motivating thoughts, ﬂip back to Chapters 5, 6, and 7
for a myriad of ways to defeat such thinking.
3. Jot down your reactions to this exercise under My Reﬂections (see Worksheet 10-8).

Keeping track of your progress
An effective way to boost motivation is to keep an exercise calendar. On this calendar, track
the physical activity you do everyday, and write down your reactions to the activity. When
you commit yourself to writing something down, you tend to pay more attention to what
you do. That’s just part of human nature. The following is a brief example of an exercise cal-
endar; read it through before starting your own.
Randy is a unit secretary at a busy hospital. He feels like his life is out of control: He can’t
save enough money to go to school, his social life seems ﬂat, and his mood is gloomy. On
top of that, he notices his belly is beginning to stick out for the ﬁrst time. His pants are too
tight, and he feels hopeless. Randy talks to a friend who urges him to join a gym to get
active again. Randy’s therapist agrees with the recommendation, so Randy joins a gym and
begins tracking his daily physical activity (see Worksheet 10-9).

I
t’s hard to be anxious or depressed when you’re having fun. Laughter, enjoyment, and
pleasure interfere with feelings of sadness or worry, and pleasure actually causes your
body to release endorphins, brain chemicals that increase a sense of well-being. Unfortunately,
when you suffer from anxiety or depression, you tend to withdraw from pleasurable activi-
ties. Thus, we recommend that you bring pleasure back into your life as part of your healing
process.
In this chapter, we help you choose from a variety of healthy pleasures — activities, people,
and events that are good for you and help combat anxiety and depression.
What’s Your Pleasure?
Emotional distress interferes with thinking. If you’re sad or worried, you may have difﬁculty
coming up with ideas about what sounds pleasurable. Not to worry. That’s why we created
The Nifty 50 Checklist of Pleasurable Activities (see Worksheet 11-1). As you can see, this
list doesn’t consist of spectacular, intense pleasures. Rather, it contains a wide range of
simple pleasures — and research has found that simple pleasures actually provide more
enjoyment than occasional, spectacular pleasures anyway.
1. Review the list of pleasurable activities in Worksheet 11-1.
2. Check off any items that sound appealing to you now or have been pleasurable to
you in the past.
3. In Worksheet 11-2, record the items that you believe you can bring into your life.

Assuming you’ve managed to create your own list of pleasurable activities, it’s time to
schedule them into your life. Use the following instructions to complete this part of the
pleasure process.
1. In Worksheet 11-3, for each day of the week, write down one or more pleasurable
activities that you plan to engage in. Try to pick different activities across the week.
Ideally, choose some that you haven’t done in a while.
2. After you complete the pleasurable activity, circle it in the chart as a marker of your
accomplishment.
3. Notice how you feel at the end of a week in which you’ve increased your simple
pleasures.
4. Jot down your observations under My Reﬂections in Worksheet 11-4.

Poisonous Pleasures
We don’t want you taking this pleasure idea too far. Pleasure’s great, of course, but some
pleasures can get you into instant trouble, and other pleasures, when taken to extremes,
can be dangerous or unhealthy. Thus, we’d be remiss if we didn’t make note of the dangers
some pleasures hold. Watch out for
162
Part III: Actions Against Angst: Behavior Therapy 

 Drug abuse
 Prostitution
 Alcohol to excess
 Hanging out with bad company
 Sleeping to excess
 Watching television endlessly
 Overeating
 Sexual promiscuity
 Excessive caffeine consumption
 Compulsive exercise
 Shopping beyond your budget
 Reckless driving
 Gambling
 Thrill-seeking through risky behaviors
 Shoplifting
 Gobbling two gallons of cookie dough ice cream (our personal favorite!)
If you engage in one or more of these poisonous pleasures, please consider seeking profes-
sional help. Even healthy activities like exercising or dieting, when taken to the extreme or
overdone, can become a problem. Furthermore, these behaviors can greatly complicate the
task of overcoming anxiety and depression.
Pleasure Busters
Ideally, you found a nice list of pleasurable activities from our Nifty 50 Checklist (see
Worksheet 11-1) and were able to insert them into your regular life without too much 
trouble. However, we know that many people don’t ﬁnd this task so easy to do.
Emotional distress and especially depression cause distorted thinking (see Chapters 5, 6,
and 7 for the lowdown on distorted thinking). In this section, we zero in on the thoughts
that are most likely to interfere with your efforts to increase pleasure in your life. Three
types of distortions typically get in the way: thoughts of undeservingness and unworthi-
ness, thoughts that pleasure is a frivolous waste of time, and thoughts that deny the
effectiveness of pleasurable activities.
Deciding to deserve fun
Depression and anxiety affect your self-esteem — and not for the better. When you’re sad or
anxious, you probably don’t think too highly of yourself. And along with low self-esteem
come thoughts such as
 I don’t deserve happiness or pleasure.
 I’m not good enough.
163
Chapter 11: Entertaining Enjoyment

 I’m not getting enough done as it is, so I certainly don’t have time for pleasure.
 I deserve punishment, not pleasure.
 I’ve let everyone down. How can I justify having fun?
As you may imagine, these types of thoughts don’t exactly result in a strong desire to seek
pleasure and fun. They also increase emotional distress in general. Clearly, it’s best to 
rethink those thoughts. The following example illustrates how pleasure-busting thoughts
can be turned into pleasure-boosting thoughts.
Theresa suffers from depression. Her therapist suggests that she increase the pleasurable
activities in her life. Theresa ﬁnds herself resisting the idea, so she and her therapist explore
the reasons behind her reluctance. They discover two pleasure-busting thoughts standing
in the way: “I don’t deserve pleasure,” and “I’m not getting enough done in my life as it is.”
Theresa and her therapist work together to rethink her pleasure-busting thoughts.
Worksheet 11-5 shows what they come up with.

because I’m so depressed. If I get less depressed, I’ll
be more productive.
If you ﬁnd that you’re resisting increasing pleasure in your life, it’s likely you have one or
more pleasure-busting thoughts. The following exercise helps you identify the pleasure-
busting thoughts you may have and develop more adaptive, pleasure-boosting thoughts.
1. Read the pleasure-busting thoughts in the left-hand column of Worksheet 11-6. These
are the most common thoughts people have that get in the way of increasing pleas-
ure. Circle those relevant to you.
2. Add any thoughts that aren’t on our list in the extra spaces provided.
3. For each thought that you’ve circled or added, develop a pleasure-boosting thought
that refutes the pleasure-busting thought. Consider the following points in developing
motivating thoughts:
• Is this pleasure-busting thought actually exaggerated or illogical in some way?
• Is there a better way to think about this pleasure-busting thought?
• If a friend of mine told me that thought, would I think it was completely legitimate
or would it sound merely self-defeating?
• Is this thought helping me?
If you struggle to come up with pleasure-boosting thoughts, turn to Chapter 3 for ways to
defeat the distorted thinking that’s standing in your way.

Finding fun frivolous?
Common thoughts among the pleasure-challenged folks of the world are, “Having a good
time is a waste of time,” and “Fun is frivolous.” These people usually think that work and
accomplishments are acceptable activities, but fun, entertainment, or even relaxation are
deﬁnitely unacceptable. Their leisure activities are typically ones that expand their knowl-
edge or increase their skills.
We’re not saying that expanding your horizons is a bad thing, but trashy novels, silly
movies, a walk in the park, some time at a comedy club, dancing, or a little karaoke (mind
you, you’ll never, ever see us doing this one!) have many beneﬁts.
Beneﬁts, you ask? Absolutely. Research shows that pleasure forms the backbone of a
healthy life. For starters, pleasure decreases anxiety and depression because it releases
endorphins that make you feel grrrreat. But it also has other important physical and emo-
tional beneﬁts such as
 Improved immune function
 Decreased feelings of chronic pain
 Decreased risk of heart attack
 Decreased stress
 Prolonged life expectancy
165
Chapter 11: Entertaining Enjoyment

 Enhanced sense of well-being
 Improved overall health
 Increased productivity
Did you notice that last item, “Increased productivity”? Many people think that non-work
related activities are frivolous. Truth is, putting pleasure into your life actually makes you
more productive when you’re working. You have more enthusiasm for your work and more
energy. In other words, you’re very likely to get more done if you just take a break every
once in a while!
If you’ve fallen into the “fun is frivolous” mind trap, we’d like you to seriously consider the
beneﬁts of pleasure. Think about what pleasure and its beneﬁts can mean to you and your
life. Jot down your conclusions under My Reﬂections in Worksheet 11-7.
Worksheet 11-7
My Reﬂections
Pleasure-pooping predictions
Minds riddled with depression and anxiety do a curious thing: They make predictions about
how much you’re likely to enjoy various activities. And with amazing consistency, these pre-
dictions, such as the following, are negative:
 I’m not going to enjoy myself at all.
 That sounds so boring.
 I’ll just look stupid.
 I’m too down to like anything like that.
 I’m too anxious to enjoy myself at that party.
Recognize any of these thoughts? Research has demonstrated rather conclusively that,
especially when you’re depressed or anxious, such predictions are worse than unreliable —
they’re actually reliably wrong! In other words, when you push yourself to engage in a poten-
tially pleasurable activity, you’re highly likely to discover that you enjoy it more than you
think you will.
But if you believe what your mind tells you and take its negative predictions as the gospel
truth, you’ll follow the wrong road again and again — you’ll avoid pursuing pleasure. Listening
to your mind is a little like listening to the radio for the daily trafﬁc report. Each and every
day the reporter tells you to avoid taking I-40 because of construction delays. So you choose
the surface roads and spend an extra 20 minutes getting to work. The only problem is that
the reporter is lying to you, and you’d be much better off not listening to his advice. Think
of this conniving reporter as your mind, predicting that activities can’t possibly cause you
pleasure, and ﬁre the reporter in your mind.

of 0 (no fun at all) to 10 (maximal pleasure). Write that number in the middle
column.
4. Do the pleasurable activity.
5. Rate how much enjoyment you actually felt from each activity on the same scale of 
0 (no fun at all) to 10 (maximal pleasure).

epression and anxiety steal energy, hope, and motivation. When negative emotions
cloud your mind, it’s hard to get moving. Everyday tasks seem overwhelming, simple
problems appear complex, and molehills become mountains as a vicious cycle begins. In
the end, not getting things done and not solving problems only make you more depressed
and anxious.
In this chapter, you discover how to get going again. We warn you about the trap of waiting
for motivation, and you get action plans for, well, umm . . . action. We also provide a com-
prehensive, step-by-step game plan for untangling your problems and coping with your
solutions.
The Motivation Myth
Especially if you’re depressed, you may ﬁnd yourself spending a lot of time spinning your
wheels. In other words, you’re not accomplishing what you want to do, and you aren’t even
able to take the ﬁrst step toward reversing your inactivity. You’re likely to tell yourself, “I’ll
do these things when I feel motivated.” Ahh, but that thought buys into a common myth
that if you wait for motivation to arrive on your doorstep, you’ll feel like taking action when
it ﬁnally comes along. In actuality, action creates motivation — the more you do, the more
you want to do. It doesn’t work as reliably the other way around. The following example
highlights the relationship between action and motivation.
It’s Saturday morning and we need to get six pages of writing done today in order to stay 
on schedule. We’re in sunny New Mexico, and — big surprise — we don’t feel like writing. 
In fact, we really don’t want to write today. The sky is so blue, the temperature outside is
perfect, and the winds are calm. So the thought of writing is more and more dreadful by the
minute. Ugh. We’re getting kind of depressed ourselves. How about we just put this task off
until we’re more motivated?
There’s two little problems with that plan: Not only will we fall behind, but also we’re not
entirely sure that the motivation will come along. Ever. If we wait for motivation that never
comes, we’ll never ﬁnish the book, you’ll never read it, and our publisher will be really,
really unhappy with us. The momentary relief from not writing on this beautiful Saturday
morning leads to a whole lot of misery. Not a pretty picture.

What’s our alternative? To sit down and write, of course! When we do, something miracu-
lous happens: We actually start to feel like doing it. In fact, we have fun with it by writing
about this example of action creating motivation rather than the other way around.
One way to jump-start action is through the creation of an activity log (see the following
example). An activity log is an action plan that plots out at least one small activity to accom-
plish each day and includes space to record how the task went and how it felt to complete
it. Keeping track of the activities and small tasks you accomplish can give you incentive to
keep going. Motivation will slowly but surely rise, and you’ll do even more than you
expected.

for her. She decides to ask her cousin, a bookkeeper, to come in and help her get started on
straightening out her ﬁnances. Overall, the activity log helps Carmen get going again.

If you’ve been feeling stuck lately and overwhelmed by all that you need to do, we recom-
mend you create your own activity log to get back on track.
1. Think about the various tasks and chores you’ve been putting off.
2. In the middle column of Worksheet 12-2, jot down one task or chore for each day of
the week.
Start with small tasks, and break big tasks into smaller parts. For example, don’t take
on cleaning out the entire garage on a single day; instead, tackle one messy shelf at a
time. Make tasks doable!
3. On each day, complete the corresponding task and, in the right-hand column, write
down how it went and how it made you feel to do it. If you don’t complete a given
task, don’t beat yourself up; just move onto the next one.

Worksheet 12-3
My Reﬂections
Scoring Goals with S.O.C.C.E.R.
When people are emotionally distressed, many situations seem overwhelmingly difﬁcult.
Anxiety and depression make even small problems appear insurmountable because emo-
tional pain interferes with clear thinking.
When feeling overwhelmed, most folks avoid the problem at hand as long as they can. This
avoidance is unfortunate because problems usually grow rather than fade away. Because
avoidance is not the answer, we have a way for breaking problems down and ﬁguring out
what to do with them. We call the plan S.O.C.C.E.R. so that it’s easy to remember. Here’s
what S.O.C.C.E.R. stands for:
 S: Situation, meaning the nature and causes of the problem as well as your beliefs and
feelings about the issue.
 O: All possible options for addressing the problem.
 C: The consequences or results most likely to occur with each option.
 C: Choosing which option to go with.
 E: The emotional plan for dealing with distress associated with the solution you choose.
 R: Running and reviewing your plan. Afterward, sit back and evaluate how well it
worked; you may be pleased with the outcome, or you may want to revise your plan.
In the following sections, we review each of the S.O.C.C.E.R. steps in detail. To give you 
a complete picture of how this process works, you follow one example subject, Derrick, 
who solves a problem about his work. You see how he completes each component of the
S.O.C.C.E.R. problem-solving process, and then we tell you how to do the same for yourself.
The S.O.C.C.E.R. system is useful regardless of whether you’re feeling emotional distress. Even
if you feel great, you can employ this plan for tackling some of life’s most vexing issues.
Sizing things up (S)
Rather than bury your head in the sand, take a good, hard look at your problem. Gather
information about it, and think about the causes and the relative importance of the problem
to your life. Believe it or not, you’re not the ﬁrst person to experience your problem. You
can obtain information by talking to others, through books and articles, or by searching the
Internet. Finally, reﬂect on what feelings this problem stirs up in you.

Part III: Actions Against Angst: Behavior Therapy 

Derrick feels frustrated at work as a mechanical engineer. He hasn’t been given the level of
responsibilities he feels capable of taking on, and he hasn’t received the bonuses or recogni-
tion he’s expected. His frustration grows as he ruminates about his dilemma in the early
morning hours. He realizes that the situation is contributing to his mounting depression.
Derrick goes online and researches comparable jobs; he also reads some books about career
advancement. Derrick decides the ﬁrst step in tackling his problem is describing it (see
Worksheet 12-4).
Worksheet 12-4
Derrick’s Problematic Situation: S.
I’m not happy with my job. I want more responsibility and the pay and recogni-
tion that go along with it. I’ve been here for six years, and I’m still doing the
same things I was when I got here. I don’t think the problem is a lack of skills;
I’m pretty conﬁdent about my talent. One of the books I’ve read suggests that
maybe I haven’t been assertive enough and made myself known around here.
This issue keeps me up at night, so it’s quite important.
After describing his problem in great detail, Derrick is ready to go on to the next step, ﬁgur-
ing out his options.
Using Derrick’s description as a guide, take the time to describe your problematic situation.
1. In Worksheet 12-5, describe your problematic situation.
2. Consider reading books and articles or searching the Internet for helpful insights,
and record any relevant information you ﬁnd.
3. Include information about possible causes of your problem.
4. Include your emotional responses to the problem — does it make you feel
depressed, frustrated, anxious, or something else?
5. Indicate how important the problem is to you.
Worksheet 12-5
My Problematic Situation: S.
Collecting options (O)
After you lay out your problem, it’s time to let the creative juices ﬂow. This step asks you to
brainstorm any and all possible ways of tackling your problem. Be sure to list all the ideas
you have, even if they sound silly. Put your internal critique on hold and let loose. 
173
Chapter 12: Getting Moving and Tackling Life’s Problems

If you’re stumped for solution ideas, consider reading books — your local librarian will have
ideas. And ask trusted people who have gone through similar problems. 
Derrick learns more about the job market and continues to read about career advancement
in his ﬁeld. He talks with friends and co-workers in order to brainstorm his options. After a
lot of research and thought, he lists his ideas (see Worksheet 12-6).

skills; I’m pretty conﬁdent about my talent. One of the books I’ve read suggests
that maybe I haven’t been assertive enough and made myself known around
here. This issue keeps me up at night, so it’s quite important.
Options
I can look for another job.
I can work on my assertiveness skills — maybe take a Dale Carnegie class
and go to Toastmasters.
I can ask for a meeting with my supervisor and discuss my concerns.
I can do nothing about work and try to ﬁnd pleasure in outside pursuits.
I could go into business for myself.
I could tell the boss off.
I could get even more education and training in order to impress the 
higher-ups.
I could network and politic at work more than I do. I could start by attending all
those stupid company picnics and parties.
Derrick feels he’s covered all bases with his possible options. He’s now ready for the next
step in the S.O.C.C.E.R. problem-solving process, recognizing consequences.
Complete your own options step by following these instructions:
1. In Worksheet 12-7, write down the situation you describe in Worksheet 12-5.
2. Gather data from books, the Internet, friends — basically anywhere.
3. Develop a list of options for dealing with your problem and write them down in the
space provided. Don’t forget — one option is to not solve the problem and deal with
the status quo.
Don’t censor your ideas; put down anything that’s even in the ballpark of helping your 
situation.

Making a choice (C)
In order to make a choice about how to handle your problem, you need to carefully consider
each option and its most likely outcome (see Worksheet 12-9). Reﬂect on how each option
would make you feel — if you were to carry it out. Some options may seem pretty difﬁcult.
And some options, you would obviously not select. 
When you make your selection, commit to it even it it seems very difﬁcult. You may want to
tell others what you plan to do because spreading the word often makes the commitment
more ﬁrm and makes you think twice before backing out or giving up.
It may not seem so, but deciding to make no choice is really making a choice. Doing nothing
has its own set of likely outcomes.
Derrick sizes up his options and their potential consequences and makes the decision to
work on his communication, assertiveness, social, and political skills. He decides to sign up
for some classes, read books, and start going to company functions.
In order to make your own choices, follow these instructions and use Derrick’s example as a
guide.
1. Review your S.O.C. form (see Worksheet 12-9).
2. Choose the option or options that really make the most sense to you — the ones
most likely to get you what you want.
3. Jot down your selection in Worksheet 12-10.
Worksheet 12-10
My Choice: C.
Working up the courage (E)
Many people make decisions to do something but procrastinate when it comes to carrying
out those decisions. Why? Because many actions arouse anxiety, fear, or distress. If your
choice of options makes you tremble, consider the following tips:
 Role-play and rehearsal: Using imagery in your mind, you can rehearse carrying out
your solution. Or even better, rehearse it aloud by yourself or with a trusted friend.
The more times you repeat your rehearsal, the more you’re likely to feel prepared 
and calm.
 Self-talk: Think of some positive statements you can repeat to yourself as you carry
out your plan. Consider writing them on a card to carry with you as a reminder.
Positive statements may include:
178
Part III: Actions Against Angst: Behavior Therapy 

• This is the right thing to do.
• I can tolerate the discomfort; it won’t last long.
• I worked hard to consider other alternatives; this is the best shot.
• I have the absolute right to carry this out.
 Brief relaxation strategy: Not only is it quick and simple, but this technique helps
calm acute anxiety. (See Chapter 13 for more information and practice with relaxation
techniques.)
1. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose.
2. Hold your breath for a few seconds.
3. Breathe out through your mouth very slowly.
4. As you breathe out, make a slight hissing sound.
5. Repeat ten times.
After you work through these recommendations, write down your personal emotional plan
in Worksheet 12-11.
Worksheet 12-11
My Emotional Plan: E.
Letting it rip (R)
Running your solution and reviewing its effectiveness are crucial to your success. You’ve
gone through the problem-solving process, and now it’s time to turn all that work into
action. Decide when would be a good time to execute your plan, and do it! Afterward, evalu-
ate how your plan worked.
Derrick decides to improve his communication and social skills, so he completes the
actions he selected earlier in the process. Worksheet 12-12 shows Derrick’s reﬂections on
how his solution goes.
Worksheet 12-12
Derrick’s Running and Reviewing: R.
I think some of these strategies are working for me. Just last week, I was
chosen to take the lead on a project. That’s a ﬁrst. And I’ve noticed that other
people are seeking me out for advice more. The talk I gave last week actually
went okay; I didn’t faint. At this point, I want to improve my presentation skills 
further by taking a class at the university. This feels like a good start.

Chapter 12: Getting Moving and Tackling Life’s Problems

As you can see, Derrick’s plan works out pretty well. Yours may or may not. If your plan 
isn’t a rousing success, be sure to include in your running and reviewing stage any ideas for
either continuing what you’re doing or making alterations to your game plan. You can even
run through the S.O.C.C.E.R. problem-solving process anew.

epression and anxiety have an important physical, or
biological, component. Emotional problems may be
the result of chemical imbalances, illnesses, or chronic

traced to or made worse by emotional factors.
In this part, we instruct you in relaxing your body through
breathing, exercise, muscle relaxation, and improved sleep.
Then we help you decide whether or not you’re a good

In This Chapter
 Knowing what relaxation can do for you
 Practicing different relaxation strategies
 Rooting out things that ruin sleep
 Capturing pleasurable sleep
You’re running late. You dash to the car and drive a little too fast. Your cellphone rings,
and you reach for it on the seat next to you. When your eyes return to the road, you
see that the car ahead of you has come to a dead stop. You stomp on your brakes and
barely avoid an accident — an enormous parking lot looms ahead on the freeway. You feel
every muscle in your body tighten up, your heart pounds, and you begin to sweat. Drat!
Another rotten start to the day.
Modern life supplies a never-ending string of opportunities for revving up your entire
system. Your body prepares you to react to perceived dangers and stressors by orchestrat-
ing a complex response:
 Your brain sends messages to your nervous system to go into high gear.
 Your eyes widen to let in more light.
 Your heart beats faster.
 Your digestion slows so that energy is available for large muscles, which tighten.
 Blood ﬂow increases to the arms and legs so that you can run or ﬁght.
 Sweating increases to keep your body cool.
All these responses are pretty handy if you need to physically defend yourself or run away.
But typically speaking, most folks don’t jump out of their cars to beat up other drivers or
abandon their cars and run to work. Well, okay, maybe in L.A. they do.
The costs of chronically revving up your body’s ﬁght or ﬂight response include high blood
pressure, chronic muscle spasms, tension headaches, suppressed immune system, irrita-
ble bowel syndrome, ulcers, and on and on. That’s a rather high price for responses you
rarely need.
In this chapter, we look at the beneﬁts of relaxation. We give you some quick, effective
strategies for teaching your body to chill out, even when you ﬁnd yourself in stressful situa-
tions. Finally, we show you how to enhance the quality of your sleep, which increases your
ability to cope with stress.

Relaxation: What’s in It for Me?
We know your life is probably hectic and stressed, and time is hard to come by. Learning to
relax takes some time, so why in the world would you want to devote precious minutes to
the task of relaxation? We can think of a few pretty good reasons:
 Reduced blood pressure
 Improved immune response
 Increased sense of well-being
 Reduced anger
 Better sleep
 Decreased risk of heart disease
 Decreased risk of chronic diseases
 Reduced pain
 Decreased anxiety
 Improved mood
 Improved ability to cope
 Improved productivity
Not a bad deal, is it? Relax for a few minutes of each day, and you’ll improve your health and
sense of well-being. Not only that, you’re likely to make up for the time lost through relaxing
by becoming more efﬁcient and productive.
Maybe you’re a pretty calm person and don’t need to learn to relax. How do you know? Take
a few minutes to complete the following exercise which will help you decide whether or not
spending a little time learning to relax is a good idea for you.
1. Think about your days over the last week.
2. In Worksheet 13-1, write down all situations and times when you felt truly calm and
relaxed.
3. Write down all the situations and times you recall feeling tense and stressed.
4. Take stock of your life, and reﬂect on whether you need to do something about your
approach to relaxation.
Worksheet 13-1
Personal Relaxation Review
Although rather rare, some people report that relaxation techniques sometimes actually
induce a sense of panic and loss of control. If that starts to happen to you, cease practicing
the strategies covered in this chapter and consult a mental health professional.
184
Part IV: Phocus on Physical Pheelings 

Breathing Tension Away
You may not realize it, but the way you breathe can either increase or decrease your ten-
sion. Many people breathe in a manner that’s counterproductive in terms of relaxation:
They breathe too shallowly, restricting their breathing to the upper chest area, or breathe
too fast. Sometimes, people under stress even hold their breath for a while, which further
heightens their body’s arousal.
Abdominal breathing
You don’t get the full beneﬁt from breathing when you breathe into your upper chest. Such
shallow breathing fails to ﬁll your lungs properly, and it can lead to stress and hyperventila-
tion. Plus, shallow breathing isn’t the body’s natural response; watch a baby breathing and
you’ll see that its tummy rises and falls more than its chest area. Somehow, as people grow
older, they forget this inborn style of breathing. Perhaps parents give too many directives to
stand up straight and hold that stomach in!
This exercise shows you what it’s like to breathe like a baby.
1. Lie down on your back either on a soft carpet, a mat, or a bed.
2. Bend your knees slightly so your back is ﬂat and you feel comfortable.
3. Place one hand on your stomach.
4. Place one hand on your chest.
5. Breathe so that your abdomen rises and falls more than your chest.
6. Breathe this way for several minutes.
7. Take notice of how you feel, and write your observations in Worksheet 13-2.
Worksheet 13-2
My Reﬂections
You can practice abdominal breathing just about anywhere, anytime. For example, take three
minutes at work to concentrate on breathing deeply. You don’t even have to lie down (if you
do, make sure the boss doesn’t see you!). Just sit quietly and breathe while making sure to let
your stomach rise more than your chest so that you ﬁll up your lungs more fully. And three
minutes will refresh you. With practice, abdominal breathing just may become routine for you.
Anti-panic breathing
If you ever experience intense anxiety or panic, your breathing no doubt quickens and
becomes more shallow. These changes may increase your heart rate and blood pressure,
you may feel dizzy, and your thinking may get confused.
185
Chapter 13: Relaxing the Heart and Soul

This breathing technique can cut short the effects of panic on your breathing. Practice it
now and from time to time when you’re not panicked so that you know how to do it when
you need to most.
1. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose.
2. Hold your breath and count to six.
3. Slowly breathe out through your mouth while making a very slight hissing noise.
This noise helps you slow your breath down. The noise should be subtle because
you’re the only one who needs to hear it. After all, you don’t want people thinking
you’re nuts!
4. Repeat this cycle ﬁve or ten times, until you feel that you’ve calmed down a little.
5. In Worksheet 13-3, write your observations on how this exercise makes you feel.

Gentle breathing
It doesn’t get any simpler than this breathing technique, and gentle breathing doesn’t take
much time either.
1. Go to a comfortable place and sit down.
2. Simply pay attention to your breathing. Be aware of the air as it ﬂows through your
nose and into your lungs. Notice how your muscles pull the air gently in and out.
3. Allow your breathing to develop a slow, even ﬂow — in and out.
4. Imagine bringing a delicate ﬂower with dainty petals up to your nostrils. Soften your
breath so that the petals remain still.
5. Continue to be aware of the air as it goes through your nose and lungs.
6. Note how focusing on your breathing gradually relaxes and calms you.
7. Feel how refreshing the air is.
8. Continue gentle breathing while focusing on the feel of the passing air.
9. In Worksheet 13-4, write your observations on how this exercise makes you feel.
Consider practicing gentle breathing for ﬁve minutes every day for ten days or so. You may
discover that you want to continue this or one of the other breathing strategies for the rest
of your life. Relaxed breathing is a simple, yet powerful way of teaching your body to relax.
Gradually, you’ll ﬁnd yourself able to employ such breathing to reduce stress whenever you
encounter it.

Mellowing Your Muscles
One of the most thoroughly researched methods for teaching your body to relax is called
progressive muscle relaxation. It sounds scientiﬁc and complicated, but you can ﬁnd easy
techniques for muscle relaxation in a variety of books, tapes, CDs, and on the Internet. Flat
out: Muscle relaxation works. That’s why, in this section, we give you one of our favorite
muscle relaxation strategies. In the beginning, this technique will take you about 15 or 20
minutes. As you practice the exercise, you’ll be able to accomplish relaxation in a shorter
period of time. After a while, some people are able to relax their bodies within just two or
three minutes!
To get the most out of this relaxation exercise, ﬁnd a quiet place where you’re unlikely to be
disturbed. Turn off phones and pagers. Wear comfortable clothing, take off your shoes, and
loosen any tight belts or restrictive clothing.
Feel free to record these instructions on a tape. Following tape-recorded instructions is
probably more relaxing than reading and then doing each step. Be sure to speak slowly and
calmly.
The following relaxation procedure is excerpted from our book, Overcoming Anxiety For
Dummies (Wiley). Practice this procedure frequently until you can do it without looking at
the instructions. This technique involves systematically tensing various muscle groups and
holding that tension for a few moments — perhaps ﬁve or ten seconds. Then you release
the tension and allow relaxation to take over. The procedure starts with your hands and
arms, moves through the neck, back, and face, and progresses down the legs and feet.
1. Take a deep breath from your abdomen, hold it for a few seconds, and slowly
exhale, letting the tension go.
Imagine that your whole body is a balloon losing air as you exhale and release tension
with the air. Take three more such breaths, and feel your entire body become more
limp with each one.
2. Squeeze your ﬁngers into a ﬁst, and feel the tension. Release your hands and let
them go limp, allowing the tension in your hands to ﬂow out.
3. Raise your arms until they’re almost even with your shoulders, and tighten the mus-
cles. Hold the tension, and then drop your arms as though the string holding them
up has been cut.
Make sure you tense the muscles on the inside and outside of both the upper and
lower arms. If you’re not sure you’re doing that, use one hand to do a tension check on
the opposite arm.
187
Chapter 13: Relaxing the Heart and Soul

4. Raise your shoulders up as though you were a turtle trying to get into its shell. Hold
the tension, and then let your shoulders drop.
5. Pull your shoulders back, bringing your shoulder blades closer together. Hold that
tension . . . and let it go.
6. Scrunch up your entire face by squeezing your forehead down, bringing your jaws
together, tightening your eyes and eyebrows, and contracting your tongue and lips.
Feel the tension, and then relax.
7. Gently drop your head back, and feel the muscles tighten in the back of your neck.
Notice that tension, hold it, let go, and relax.
8. Gently move your chin toward your chest. Tighten your neck muscles, and let the
tension increase. Maintain the tension, and then relax.
9. Tighten the muscles in your stomach and chest. Hold the tension, and then let it go.
10. Arch your back (by pressing against a chair or just arching it on your own), hang on
to the contraction (but don’t push too far), and then relax.
Be gentle with your lower back, and skip this step entirely if you’ve ever had trouble
with this part of your body.
11. Contract your buttocks muscles so as to gently lift yourself up in your chair. Hold
the tension, and then relax your muscles.
12. Squeeze and relax your thigh muscles.
13. Contract the muscles in your calves by pulling your toes toward your face. Hold the
tension, and then relax your calves.
If you’re prone to muscle cramps, don’t overdo this exercise. Only contract your mus-
cles as much as you feel comfortable with.
14. Gently curl your toes, maintain the tension, and then relax.
15. Take time to tour your entire body, noticing if you feel different than when you
began.
If you ﬁnd any areas of tension, allow the relaxed areas to come in and replace the
tense ones. If that doesn’t work, repeat the tense-and-relax procedure for the tense
area.
16. Spend a few minutes enjoying the relaxed feelings. Let relaxation spread and pene-
trate every muscle ﬁber in your body. You may feel warmth, or you may feel a
ﬂoating sensation. Perhaps you’ll feel a sense of sinking down. When you wish to do
so, open your eyes and go on with your day, perhaps feeling like you just returned
from a brief vacation.
Although we recommend you spend 15 or 20 minutes a day on the muscle relaxation proce-
dure at ﬁrst, you can shorten it considerably. With practice, you’ll be able to tense up
several muscles groups at once. For example, you may tense hands and arms at the same
time. Eventually, you may tense all the muscles in your lower body at once, followed by all
the muscles in your upper body. If you carry all your tension in your neck, shoulders, or
back, try tensing and relaxing just those muscles. Repeat the tense-and-relax cycle once or
twice on especially tight muscles if that helps.
Use Worksheet 13-5 to track your thoughts and observations about using progressive
muscle relaxation.

Getting Your Zzzzzzz’s
Depression and anxiety disrupt sleep. Some people have trouble falling asleep, others wake
up in the early morning hours and can’t get back to sleep, and some people even have both
problems. On the other hand, a few people with anxiety or depression sleep too much —
way too much — and their sleep isn’t refreshing.
If you have trouble sleeping, it probably adds to your emotional distress. And as your emo-
tional distress mounts from lack of sleep, your sleep problems deepen. Talk about a vicious
cycle.
Serious, chronic sleep disturbances may be a symptom of a major depressive disorder or an
undiagnosed physical problem. You should consult your physician if you have major, unremit-

Your answers to these questions should give you a good picture of your sleep patterns. If it
doesn’t appear that you have a sleep problem, feel free to skip the rest of this chapter! But 
if you clearly struggle with sleep, read on. The following sections tell you what you should
know about each of the seven sleep situations in Worksheet 13-6 and what you can do about
each one.

Part IV: Phocus on Physical Pheelings 

Sleep situation #1: Watching 
what you eat and drink
You probably know that caffeine is a stimulant and, as such, keeps many people awake. Some
folks don’t seem to be all that affected by caffeine, but others may lie awake for hours after
a single cup of java. Coffee isn’t the only culprit though; other sources of caffeine include
tea, many soft drinks, chocolate, and some pain relievers. Read the labels of what you’re
consuming or you may be wide awake all night!
You may think that alcohol is the opposite of caffeine, so it should do the trick and put you
right to sleep, right? Well, not exactly. Some people ﬁnd a glass or two of wine relaxing and 
a helpful inducement of sleep. However, too much alcohol interferes with restful sleep. For
that matter, too much of anything — such as rich foods or an especially late dinner —
before bed can mess with your sleep.
When it comes to eating and drinking before bed, if you just have to have something, try an
herbal tea without caffeine, such as chamomile or valerian. Or have a small glass of milk or
a light snack. And we probably don’t have to tell you not to drink gallons of ﬂuids before
you go to bed or you’ll be up all night for different reasons.
Sleep situation #2: Watching what you do
One key to restful sleep is going to bed somewhat relaxed. Strenuous and aerobic activities
tend to stimulate the body, so avoid any such activities for at least an hour before you hit
the sack. Also, don’t call your mother and have a big argument. While you’re at it, don’t call
your ex-spouse or anyone who’s likely to get you worked up.
Instead, develop a regular winding-down routine that you can go through prior to bed. A
warm bath (not overly hot, which can be stimulative for some), quiet music, a good book
(probably not a horror novel), or a little television can all help you wind down.
Experiment with what you personally can or can’t do prior to bed. For some, the horrors on
the evening news don’t have any stressful effects. Others ﬁnd a murder mystery quite calm-
ing. Still others aren’t bothered by aerobic exercise. Go ﬁgure.
Sleep situation #3: The sleep setting
The environment you sleep in plays a major part in determining the quality of your sleep.
For most people, sleep comes more easily when it’s dark. But what if your work shift requires
that you sleep in the daytime? Consider getting blackout curtains or wearing a sleep mask
because darkness tells your brain it’s time to sleep.
How about that mattress you’ve had for 20 years? Is it comfortable? For some, the ﬂoor or
couch is good enough. For most of us, however, a really comfortable mattress is worth
every dime. You may want to invest in some high quality sheets as well to make your sleep
setting even more inviting.
When it comes to your sleep setting, noise matters, too. Find a way to keep your environ-
ment relatively silent. If you can’t do that, you can mask noises with a sound machine. For
example, a dog lives next door to us . . . an annoying dog . . . a really annoying dog. He barks
for hours at a time. Our dogs, of course, are perfect and only bark when dangerous people,
191
Chapter 13: Relaxing the Heart and Soul

cats, birds, hot air balloons, and delivery trucks threaten our home. Because of the neigh-
bors’ chatty four-legged friend, we leave an overhead fan on and the windows closed at
night. Works pretty well.
Finally, temperature matters. For most people, cool is better, and they can always pile on
the blankets. Sleep researchers have found that core body temperature tends to decrease
during good sleep. 
Sleep situation #4: How long is too long?
How long does it take you to get to sleep? If you lie restless in bed for more than 30 minutes
or so, we recommend that you get up. What? Get up when you want to sleep? Getting up
may sound counterproductive, but it’s important for your brain to associate your bed with
sleep. So if you lie in bed too long without actually sleeping, your brain will only get more
mixed up. Furthermore, when you get up and do something boring such as pay bills, your
brain will associate unpleasantness with getting up. Just don’t do something stimulating.
And if you do pay your bills in the middle of the night, please check your addition in the
morning.
How many hours of sleep do you rack up on a typical night? Although people differ in their
sleep needs, most folks function pretty well on six to eight hours of sleep a night. The bottom
line, however, is that if you feel rested, you’re getting enough sleep. If you don’t feel rested,
you may be getting too much or too little.
If you don’t feel rested after six to eight hours of sleep, you may have a serious sleep prob-
lem known as sleep apnea. Sleep apnea involves a series of episodes in which your breathing
stops while you sleep. You awaken momentarily to gasp for air, and then you fall back asleep,
only to have your breathing cease yet again. Sleep apnea results in very poor quality sleep
and frequently leads to nodding off in the daytime. Snoring can be a sign of sleep apnea, but
that’s not always the case. If you think you may have sleep apnea, your physician can refer
you to a sleep clinic where the condition can be accurately diagnosed.
Sleep situation #5: Waking up too much?
Waking up once on most nights is pretty typical and not a problem to be concerned about.
However, waking up frequently or being unable to get back to sleep after waking is a prob-
lem. This problem should be checked out with your physician because it may indicate
 Prostate problems (that is, if you’re a guy).
 Hormonal problems (typically, if you’re female).
 Restless leg syndrome, a condition in which you feel an uncomfortable feeling in your
legs or feet and an urge to keep moving them.
 Medication issues.
 A major depressive disorder (for which this workbook can help, but you need a profes-
sional’s opinion, too).
 Other physical conditions of various sorts.
 Other serious emotional disorders (again, this workbook can help, but you should still
seek consultation).
192
Part IV: Phocus on Physical Pheelings 

If you’ve eliminated the possible problems listed above and continue to awaken or be unable
to get back to sleep, follow the advice under all six other sleep situations in this chapter. In
particular, don’t lie awake for more than 30 minutes without going back to sleep — get up
and do something and give sleep another shot later.
Even with a good amount of sleep each night, some people feel they don’t sleep as many
hours as they really do. If you feel rested during the day, you’re getting enough sleep. If you
don’t feel rested, something’s amiss.
Sleep situation #6: When worries keep you awake
Sleep is very important, right? It’s so important that if you don’t get enough, your day will
be utterly ruined. If you don’t sleep enough, you may make terrible mistakes and even get
sick. You MUST get enough sleep!
Well, hold the phone. That kind of thinking will surely keep you awake at night and make the
next day more miserable to boot. When you ﬁnd yourself thinking such thoughts, turn to
Worksheet 13-7 for some more reasonable ways of looking at your situation:

Chapter 14
Making the Medication Decision
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether medication makes sense for you
 Talking through your treatment options with your healthcare provider
 Tracking medication side effects
T
oday, we know more about the brain and its relationship to emotional problems than
ever before; we understand that chemical imbalances in the brain accompany both anxi-
ety and depression. Because of this growing knowledge, some television commercials would
lead you to believe that making some simple corrections to your brain chemistry with the
advertised drug will cure your problem. Voila!
If it were that simple, we’d be ﬁrst in line to recommend medication for whatever emotions
disturb you. And we probably wouldn’t be writing this book because there’d be no need for it.
Alas, for the vast majority, medication alone doesn’t eliminate emotional distress, and rare is
the case when medication’s the only strategy that one would want to employ. But medication
does have an important role to play, so in this chapter, we help you make a good decision
about medications and whether you may want to consider this option. We also prepare you
for discussing medications with your doctor. If you and your doctor decide that medication
is right for you, we then help you track any side effects so that you can keep your doctor
accurately informed about your condition.
Because this is a workbook and space is limited, we don’t review the myriad of medications
available for the treatment of anxiety and depression. If you’d like more information on spe-
ciﬁc medications, look to Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies and Depression For Dummies
(Wiley). And of course, talk the issue over with your doctor.
Whether or not you take medication to alleviate your emotional distress, is a decision that
you will make in collaboration with your healthcare provider. One purpose of this chapter 
is to make you an informed consumer. Ultimately, your doctor will determine if you have a
condition that is treatable with medication. And ultimately, you will have to agree to take
the medication or not. The more information you and your doctor have, the better informed
your decision will be. 
To Take or Not to Take
One question we frequently encounter is, “What works best, medications or therapies?” The
answer is both. For depression, research tends to suggest that medication and therapy work
just about equally well. But for some types of anxiety cognitive behavior, therapies such as
the ones covered in this book may hold a slight edge. Some folks see a somewhat better out-
come when they combine medication with therapy.

Studies show that cognitive behavior therapy helps prevent relapse, so it’s strongly recom-
mended that you don’t rely on medications as your sole approach to treatment. (Much of
what you’re reading in this workbook is based upon the principles of cognitive behavior
therapy.)
How do you make the medication decision? First you need to understand that some sit-
uations or experiences support taking medication. Worksheet 14-1 lists the reasons for 
considering medication. All the items suggest a need for professional evaluation. Check 
off the situations or items that pertain to you; each additional statement that you select
increases the likelihood that medication will be part of your treatment plan.
Worksheet 14-1
Indications for Medications
❑
1. I seriously think about or plan to hurt myself or others.
❑
2. I feel out of touch with reality. I hear or see things that aren’t there.
❑
3. I have severe mood swings from high to low.
❑
4. I feel totally hopeless that things could ever improve.
❑
5. My thoughts are constantly racing and feel out of control.
❑
6. I’ve experienced a sudden, severely traumatic event.
❑
7. My emotional distress is causing severe disruptions in my life.
❑
8. I’ve tried therapy for six months or more and feel no improvement at all.
❑
9. My doctor says that medical conditions are primarily causing my depression.
❑10. I’ve been depressed or seriously anxious most of my life.
❑11. I just can’t stand the thought of talking with someone about my problems.
❑12. I feel totally overwhelmed by my emotional problems.
❑13. I have a problem with alcohol/drug use in addition to depression or anxiety.
❑14. I feel highly suspicious or paranoid.
❑15. Lately, I’ve made really terrible, outrageous decisions.
Now use Worksheet 14-2 to reﬂect on the items you’ve checked off. In the space below, elab-
orate on the statements that apply to you. Use speciﬁcs to describe how these problems
appear in your life. Include your thoughts, feelings, and observations.
Worksheet 14-2
My Summary of Medication Indications
Every coin has two sides. Worksheet 14-1 reveals the possible reasons for considering med-
ication, but there are also reasons you may not wish to take that route. Consider the
following reasons some people decide to opt out of taking medications:
198
Part IV: Phocus on Physical Pheelings 

 Side effect concerns: Different medications have various side effects. We review side
effects in detail in the section “Sizing Up Side Effects” later in this chapter, but common
ones include dry mouth, gastro-intestinal problems, sexual difﬁculties, weight gain, 
and headaches. Some people suffer side effects more than others, and although your
doctor can usually ﬁnd ways around the worst of them, side effects are a real concern.
 Worries about long-term effects: Most medications for emotional problems appear to
have relatively little short-term risk. However, some medications haven’t been around
long enough for doctors to know for sure if problems may show up after many years of
use. And because medications often must be taken for a lifetime, long-term effects are 
a serious concern.
 Addiction: Some medications for anxiety, such as benzodiazepines, are rather addictive.
That means, if you take them for more than a few months, you could become highly
dependent on them and experience withdrawal symptoms if and when you discontinue
them. However, most antidepressants don’t appear to be addictive in the usual sense,
and, good, nonaddictive alternatives for the treatment of anxiety are available.
 Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Under careful medical review, some medications for
emotional distress appear relatively safe for pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.
However, the safety data isn’t comprehensive, and controversy exists around their use
in this special case.
Postpartum depression, depression that accompanies giving birth, is relatively common
but can become quite serious if left untreated. If you experience symptoms of depres-
sion following the birth of a baby, you should get an evaluation.
 Personal preference: Because of religious reasons, philosophical viewpoints, or strong
personal preferences, some people simply choose not to take medication. If that’s the
case for you, please get treatment for your problems through self-help exercises or
through a qualiﬁed mental health professional.
Although valid reasons exist for choosing to not take medications for anxiety or depression,
if your distress is extremely severe or involves serious suicidal or homicidal thoughts, we
hope you’ll reconsider your treatment decision and consult with your doctor.
1. Review your reasons for and against taking medication.
2. Consider talking about your concerns with close friends, family, your physician,
and/or a mental health professional.
3. Make a decision about how you want medication to factor into your treatment, and
write out your reasoning process in Worksheet 14-3. Include your thoughts, feelings,
and observations.
Worksheet 14-3
My Medication Decision

Chapter 14: Making the Medication Decision

Preparing Your Prescriber
If you decide to take medication (hopefully you’re planning to do so only in conjunction
with therapy or self-help exercises), it’s important to give your healthcare provider the com-
plete and truthful information so that he or she can make an accurate recommendation for
your treatment. We don’t know about you, but we often forget what we want to say to our
doctors during hurried visits. So, we’ve created a questionnaire for you to ﬁll out and give
to your provider during your visit. Your healthcare provider may need additional informa-
tion, but the questions in Worksheet 14-4 are a good start to expressing the particulars of
your condition.

Sizing Up Side Effects
Close to half the number of people who take medications for anxiety or depression stop
because of disagreeable side effects and/or because they don’t feel they’re beneﬁting from
the drug. These people may not be aware that
 Many medications can take a number of weeks to achieve a good effect.
 Side effects often decrease or go away over time.
 The prescriber probably knows of alternative medications with fewer side effects.
 Another medication may be added to reduce side effects.
Stopping any medication for emotional difﬁculties needs to be carefully supervised because
even medications that are not addictive in the usual sense can cause troublesome reactions
if stopped abruptly. Please do not stop taking prescribed medication without consulting
your physicians. 
If you’re experiencing problems with your medication, the decision to continue with med-
ication, try an alternative medication, or add another drug to the regimen to reduce side
202
Part IV: Phocus on Physical Pheelings 

effects is best made in tandem with your healthcare provider. You guessed it — that means
you must communicate with your prescriber on a regular basis about the speciﬁc side
effects you’re experiencing.
Because it’s so important for your healthcare provider to know about your experience with
side effects, we created the Side Effect Tracking Form, shown in Worksheet 14-5, for you to
ﬁll out and take to your consultations (or use it as a guide during your telephone conversa-
tions). We recommend you complete this form at the very least for one month after you
start a new medication for depression or anxiety. (You can download additional copies of
the worksheet at www.dummies.com/go/adwbfd.)
1. For each day of the week, place a check mark next to each symptom you experience
to a noticeable degree.
2. For each symptom checked, rate its intensity on a scale of 1 (minimal) to 10 (maximal).

You always have the option of a few alternative treatments for depression and anxiety. Many
people take herbs and supplements for minor emotional distress, and your healthcare
provider can tell you about options for especially severe depression. For more information
about alternatives to medication, see Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies and Depression For
Dummies (Wiley).

Part V
Relationship Therapy

In this part . . .
Your relationships may suffer when you feel significant
amounts of anxiety or depression. And when your
relationships suffer, you no doubt feel more anxious or
depressed. It’s a rather vicious cycle.
In this part, we give you techniques to enhance relation-
ships and improve communication. We also help you deal
with loss and conflict.

Chapter 15
Restoring Relationships
In This Chapter
 Discovering the connection between emotions and relationships
 Examining your relationship
 Enhancing your relationship with positive actions
 Dealing with endings
S
upportive relationships provide a buffer against all types of emotional distress.
Numerous studies indicate that good relationships and social support improve both
mental and physical health. Humans apparently are social animals that are biologically pro-
grammed to function better when in supportive relationships. Like gorillas, birds, and ants,
we thrive in close-knit colonies. Therefore, working to improve your relationships can help
boost your moods, increase your ability to handle stress, and create a sense of well-being.
Yet, distressing emotions can get in the way of your attempts to improve your relationships.
Such emotions can harm friendships, intimate relationships, and even relationships with 
co-workers or relative strangers. So, along with the obvious ways of working to alleviate
your anxiety or depression, shoring up your relationships will also improve your moods.
In this chapter, we review strengthening strategies that you can apply to almost any type of
relationship. However, we emphasize intimate relationships because disruptions in these
types of relationships cause the most harm and because repairing them is enormously ben-
eﬁcial to your mental health. In addition, we help you cope with the loss of a relationship
because such an event can be quite traumatic and trigger intense feelings of anxiety and/or
despair.
Revealing the Emotion-Relationship Connection 
Whether you like it or not, when you’re anxious or depressed, you become more self-
absorbed. We don’t mean that you become conceited, but your attention becomes focused
on your problems and concerns. Although the shift in your focus is quite understandable,
your relationships are likely to suffer when your problems lay claim to your energy. Because
you’re mentally and emotionally drained, you don’t pay much attention to nurturing your
relationships — and relationships need nurturing.
In addition, when you’re anxious and depressed, those who care about you are likely to
make attempts to cheer you up or help you. When their efforts fall short, they often feel
frustrated and helpless. Eventually, they feel exhausted, too, and may pull away from you.
Frankly, after a prolonged time, it’s a downer to be around someone who’s constantly
bummed out.
The following example shows you how depression can easily erode a good relationship.

John slips in and out of depression with the seasons. When daylight diminishes in the
winter, his moods darken (see Depression For Dummies [Wiley] for more about Seasonal
Affective Disorder). After a whirlwind romance last summer, John marries Gia, the woman of
his dreams, in a beautiful fall wedding. He’s never been so happy.
John warns Gia about his winter blues. However, both hope that their love and her presence
in his life will help him ward off depression during the dark months. Unfortunately, depres-
sion overtakes John as the days become shorter. John withdraws from Gia, who tries to
understand but becomes hurt and frustrated with her inability to cheer him up. John feels
guilty that he’s hurting his wife but feels powerless to do anything about his predicament.
The relationship suffers.
In Worksheet 15-1, answer the questions about an important relationship in your life in
order to see if depression or anxiety have been inﬂicting harm.

Part V: Relationship Therapy 

Although depression and anxiety often cause problems in relationships, they’re not the only
culprits. Some relationships deteriorate in the presence of severe emotional problems, and
some relationships are simply unhealthy. If you wonder why your relationship isn’t doing
well, or if you suspect you’re being abused, check with a mental health professional who
specializes in couples work.
Enhancing Your Relationship
Have you ever received or given ﬂowers at the start of a new relationship? Ideally, relation-
ships continue to provide “ﬂowers” of many varieties — compliments, companionship, good
times, caring, affection, laughter, and more. Most good relationships start out with enthusi-
asm and a bouquet of good feelings. But too often, complacency sets in, and life interferes.
After a while, it’s easy to forget to send ﬂowers.
When you stop cultivating a garden, ugly weeds choke out the ﬂowers. The same is true of 
a relationship, which wilts as a result of inattention. You can fertilize your relationship by
increasing:
 Positive talk
 Positive actions
Whether your relationship is really suffering or is doing pretty well but isn’t quite what
you’d like it to be, the strategies in this section can help you make it better.
Talking together
Communication is the foundation of a good relationship. Everyone beneﬁts from having safe
people to express their thoughts and feelings to. In order to help you create the right cli-
mate for such positive communication, we introduce two exercises: the Daily News and the
Top 12 Things I Appreciate About My Partner.
If your communication with your partner is conﬂictual, jump to Chapter 16 for a ﬁx. And if
the following exercises don’t go over well, we recommend you see a therapist for couples
counseling.
Perusing the Daily News
The Daily News is a way of making sure that you and your partner spend time talking and lis-
tening to one another. The purpose of this exercise is to enhance intimacy. We recommend
that you make this exercise a high priority and perform it often.
Worksheet 15-2
The Daily News
1. Work with your partner to decide on a time when you will sit and talk about the
day’s events for 20 minutes. You may choose to chat at the same time every day, or
you may want to vary it. Daily is best (that’s why we call it the “Daily News,” but you’ll
beneﬁt from talking this way at least three or four times a week.

3. Let your partner begin and speak for ten minutes.
4. Show interest by:
• Asking a few questions for greater understanding
• Nodding your head
• Making brief comments
• Expressing empathy or understanding for how your partner feels
Don’t give advice or solve your partner’s problem at this time. And avoid criticism or
stirring up conﬂict!
5. After your partner shares the events of his or her day, try to summarize what he or
she said in a positive manner.
6. Ask your partner if your understanding of what he or she said is basically correct. If
not, ask for clariﬁcation.
7. Take your turn to talk about your day, asking your partner to follow these same rules.
After you work through the Daily News exercise a few times, reﬂect on how it went and
record your thoughts in Worksheet 15-3. How did you feel before and after the exercise? Do
you know more about your partner now, and does your partner know more about you? Do
you feel closer?

Putting compliments to good use
Compliments, when sincerely offered, enhance communication and positive feelings. When
you feel anxious or depressed, you may not think about all the things you appreciate about
your partner. But when you don’t express what you cherish and admire, your partner is
likely to feel unappreciated. We recommend you work through the following exercise, the
Top 12 Things I Appreciate About My Partner, to get back on track when it comes to compli-
menting your partner.
1. In Worksheet 15-4, write down all the things you appreciate, value, admire, and
cherish about your partner. Include attributes such as intelligence, caring, warmth,
attractiveness, talents, help with daily life (such as cooking, cleaning, ﬁnances, and so
on), sense of humor, and anything else you can think of. Only include items you feel
sincerely apply.
210
Part V: Relationship Therapy 

Be speciﬁc in your assessment of your partner. For example, rather than saying, “You’re
the best person in the whole world,” consider narrowing it down and saying, “I love the
way you play with the baby.” Also, avoid “buts”; for example, don’t say, “I really like your
hair, but it would look better shorter.” That’s really just a backhanded compliment — it
could go either way.
2. Compliment your partner at least once a day from your list (or you may come up
with something new). 
3. Create a strategy for remembering to make these compliments. For example, you may
make a note in your calendar or put sticky notes in various places around the house.
Get into the habit of handing out genuine compliments to everyone, not just your partner.
Doing so will improve your popularity by making people notice you, and it may even get you
a raise!

Some people dismiss compliments by saying, “Oh, you don’t mean that,” or “That isn’t really
true.” If your partner responds in this way, keep complimenting. People dismiss compliments
not because they don’t want to hear them but because they have trouble accepting them.
After you spend a couple of weeks increasing the compliments you give your partner, reﬂect
on any changes in your relationship (see Worksheet 15-5). Do you notice any increased
warmth, affection, or communication? Are you or your partner in a better mood?

Delightful doings
If communication is the foundation of a good relationship (see the “Talking together” section),
sharing pleasurable activities is the house that sits on top. In this section, we review an
important technique for increasing positive times with your partner: the Positive Behavioral
Exchange System. 
The Positive Behavioral Exchange System is designed to give you an easy way of showing
your partner that you care. The system involves making a list of small caring actions that
you and your partner can do for each other frequently. After making a list, each person
keeps track of what the other has done. We recommend that you review this strategy with
your partner and that you both participate in the exercise. Although this technique may
look simplistic, research shows that it works and builds surprisingly positive feelings.
(We’ve taken the essence of this idea from our friend and colleague, Dr. Richard B. Stuart.)
Before you get started on your own Positive Behavioral Exchange System, consider the fol-
lowing example.
Trisha and Michael decide to try the Positive Behavioral Exchange System because they’ve
noticed that their relationship has been getting stale. Trisha and Michael discuss speciﬁc
actions they can take to increase the pleasure they get from one another. Michael asks Trisha
to stop complaining about their ﬁnances, but in talking, they realize that his request is both
negative and focused on something they frequently argue about. So, they think of other,
more positive actions to take to increase pleasure. For example, Trisha asks Michael to be
nicer to her mother. But upon reﬂection, she realizes that her request is too vague, so she
asks him to spend one or two minutes speaking to her mother on the phone when she calls.
Worksheet 15-6 shows what they ﬁnally settle on and the results of their ﬁrst week of taking
the decided actions.

closer and warmer to each other, and they aren’t arguing as much. In fact, they enjoy the
results so much that the following week, they add several more items to their list. Both
notice an increased desire to please the other.
1. Talk with your partner and develop a list of small actions that either of you inter-
pret as an indication of caring or affection. These actions must be
• Stated positively.
• Clear and speciﬁc (so you will know for sure if it happens).
• Easily carried out.
• Able to be frequently carried out.
• Not something you’ve been ﬁghting about.
2. List these actions in the left-hand column of Worksheet 15-7.
3. Each day, in the right-hand column, write the date when you notice your partner
doing one of the items for you, and your partner should do the same.
4. At the end of each day, brieﬂy discuss the progress of your exercise with your 
partner.
5. Commit to doing at least three to ﬁve of these actions every day, whether your part-
ner does the same or not. Don’t feel obligated to do any particular item, but try to
carry out a variety of them.
Consider taping this list to your refrigerator or some other obvious place in the house so
that it’s easy for you and your partner to keep track of each other’s actions and see the
progress you’re making.

Dealing with Relationship Loss
It would be nice if people lived forever and relationships always endured. But life isn’t a
fairy tale — everyone doesn’t live “happily ever after.” Relationships break up, marriages
dissolve, circumstances cause prolonged separations, and people die. And loss, whether
from death or happenstance, causes great distress.
214
Part V: Relationship Therapy 

In fact, loss sometimes causes depression. When you lose someone, it’s natural to grieve
and feel sad. However, grief isn’t quite the same thing as depression. The main difference is
that depression includes feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, whereas grief centers
around feelings of loss and loneliness. Also, most people ﬁnd that grief decreases with time,
unlike depression. Loss or fear of loss can also create anxiety. You may think you can’t
handle life without your loved one; you may feel dependent and overwhelmed.
If you’ve lost someone, ﬁrst and foremost, take care of yourself. Be sure to eat healthy, stay
away from abusing drugs and alcohol, and exercise regularly, whether you feel like it or not —
even if you just take a 30-minute brisk walk each day. And be sure to get enough sleep.
Grieving takes a physical and mental toll, and you need all your resources to get through it.
In addition, you may want to turn to other sources of support. Don’t be afraid to ask for
help! Such sources can include
 Religious or spiritual resources
 Grief support groups
 Friends and family
 Mental health professionals
If you lose someone and feel like you can’t go on, or if you have thoughts of hopelessness or
suicide, please seek professional help promptly.
Moving on
When you’re grieving, it’s natural to feel like staying in bed and pulling the covers over your
head. And there’s a tendency to try and avoid thinking about the lost person or relationship.
Some folks even turn to drugs or alcohol in order to blunt their pain. However, all those
strategies merely make things worse.
A better approach is to explore your thoughts and feelings about the lost person. Yes, you
should actually spend some active time reviewing and reconstructing the relationship and
what the person meant to you. This process facilitates moving on.
In order to get the most out of this Grief Exploration Questionnaire (see Worksheet 15-9), 
set aside at least an hour to answer the questions. Don’t rush the process. Also, you should
expect to feel some intense sadness or grief; in fact, you’re likely to cry. But if you feel over-
whelmed or feel that you can’t handle this exercise, please seek professional help.

Becoming active
You’ll never fully replace someone you’ve lost because people and relationships are all unique
and, in one sense, irreplaceable. Nonetheless, you can pick up the pieces, move on, and
reﬁll your life with meaningful relationships and activities. We suggest you explore the fol-
lowing after you begin to recover:
 Volunteer work: A great way to regain a sense of meaning in your life is to help others.
Plus, volunteer work often leads to friendships and a new social circle.
 Pleasurable activities: Even if you feel sad and unenthusiastic, putting pleasure back
into your life is possible (see Chapter 11 for more about healthy pleasures). You won’t
feel like you “should” indulge in pleasure, but after you start to recover from your loss,
allowing yourself to enjoy things can accelerate your healing.
 Socializing: Whether it’s visiting with friends and family or starting to date again, being
with other people helps you get through tough times. Sometimes starting to date or
making new friends can feel frightening at ﬁrst. However, both are steps in learning to
love and establish new connections. Venturing back into the world is part of the heal-
ing process.

C
onﬂict with someone you care about hurts, and when you’re depressed or anxious, you
tend to be more irritable, which leads to more conﬂict. Like so many other problems
related to depression and anxiety, a vicious cycle ensues.
In this chapter, we help you break the negative cycle of conﬂict. We explain how what we
call the malicious assumption leads to defensiveness and counterattacks. Then we show you
how to track the malicious assumption and defensiveness in your relationships. You see
how identifying and understanding your hot buttons and those of your partner can help you
depersonalize what you previously considered criticism. Finally, we provide some tips for
dealing with conﬂict constructively.
Overriding Defensiveness
When people feel emotionally vulnerable, whether from depression, anxiety, or conﬂict 
in a relationship, they all too easily start making the malicious assumption in response to
something their partners say or do. The malicious assumption refers to the tendency to
automatically interpret communications or actions in the most negative, critical way possi-
ble. More often than not, the malicious assumption grossly misinterprets the true meaning
of the message.
Here’s a common, concrete example of the malicious assumption in everyday life. Suppose
you’re driving on the freeway, and someone cuts you off. You can interpret the driver’s
motive in one of two ways: as the result of careless inattentiveness or as a hostile action
aimed at you directly. Which is the malicious assumption? The belief that the driver cut you
off deliberately and with hostility. Thus, if you make this assumption, you may respond by
opening your car window and giving the other driver a good look at one of your ﬁngers (and
we’re guessing you know which one). This action, in turn, may lead to a dangerous escala-
tion of violent action, also known as road rage.
Defensiveness occurs when the malicious assumption causes you to perceive a communica-
tion or behavior as an attack. In a defensive response, you say that you aren’t to blame in any
way for the problem, or you counterattack. Saying that something’s not your fault assumes
that your partner had hostile intentions. And when you counterattack, all you accomplish is
an escalation of conﬂict. Either reaction is likely to provide fuel for an argument.
Sarcasm usually indicates defensiveness. Pay particular attention when you hear yourself
being sarcastic, and try to reign yourself in with reasonability.

The examples in Worksheet 16-1 help you see how the insidious process of assumption and
defensiveness works.

don’t like it.”
Notice that in Worksheet 16-1, all the initial communications and actions are at least some-
what ambiguous. In other words, you can’t tell with certainty whether the person had
hostile intentions. Besides, whether a message or behavior is clearly hostile, it doesn’t do
much good to respond defensively — unless, of course, all you want is a good ﬁght.
Shining the light on your defensive behavior
Before you can stop making the malicious assumption and following it with defensive
responses, you need to see how these behaviors play out in your life. Therefore, we suggest
you track events in which these behaviors crop up. Use the following instructions as your
guide. (After you identify your own defensive behaviors, we give you an alternative to defen-
siveness and explain a method for dealing with truly hostile criticism in a way that may lead
to better outcomes.)
1. Whenever your partner says or does something that you feel may have been
intended as hostile, write it down in the left-hand column of Worksheet 16-2.
2. In the middle column, write down how you interpret what happened. Try to be
honest; don’t clean up your reaction (or your language!). Say how you really feel about
what your partner said or did.

3. In the right-hand column, jot down how you respond, and analyze your response for
defensiveness: Did you try to absolve yourself of all blame, or did you counterattack
in some way?

Check, please
Hopefully the exercise in the preceding section has made you more aware of when you get
defensive. But what’s an alternative when you perceive your partner’s actions or words as
hostile or malicious? We recommend something called checking it out.
Checking it out involves ﬁrst catching the urge to be defensive. Then, when you’re ready,
you make a gentle inquiry about your partner’s true intentions.
Max promises to pick up Teva for dinner and a movie at 6:30. He arrives breathless at 6:50
saying, “Sorry, trafﬁc was horrible.” Teva immediately makes a malicious assumption, believ-
ing that Max was purposely late, which proves that Max is losing interest in her. She almost
says, “That’s what you said last time, you jerk,” but she decides to check it out. She stops
herself and takes a deep breath or two. After she calms down a little, she asks, “Max, I’m a
little worried that you might be losing interest. Is that possible?” Max is quite surprised by
the question and says, “Gosh, no. I’m really sorry if it seemed that way to you. There really
was a terrible accident. I really care about you and enjoy every second that I’m with you.”
When you ﬁnd yourself in a potentially hostile situation, take a moment and practice the
checking it out technique by following these instructions:
1. The moment you feel attacked or criticized, close your mouth!
2. Take a slow, deep breath in, and exhale very slowly. Repeat once or twice until you
feel a little calmer.
While you’re breathing, remind yourself that if you speak while you’re upset, the odds
of saying something useful or productive have been precisely calculated at 1 in 5.86 
billion.
3. When you feel calmer, inquire about your partner’s actual intentions. Gently
explain what your worry or concern is about, but don’t accuse or attack. 
4. Keep track of your exchange so that you can work through it with less emotion
involved. In Worksheet 16-4, record the initial communication or action in the left-
hand column.
5. Write down your malicious assumption in the middle column.
6. In the right-hand column, jot down how you checked out your assumption.

Don’t refuse to defuse
Another alternative to defensiveness or counterattacking is defusing. You use this technique
when your partner clearly is engaging in criticism. Basically, defusing consists of saying
something downright counterintuitive — ﬁnding at least a sliver of truth in your partner’s
statement. When you acknowledge part (or sometimes all) of your partner’s concerns, you
keep the dialogue going and take the emotional charge out of the interaction. We’re not sug-
gesting that you completely capitulate or lie to your partner but rather that you genuinely
work hard to discover your partner’s perspective on the problem at hand. Usually, you and
your partner can ﬁnd at least something to agree upon.
This technique doesn’t work for dealing with ﬂat-out verbal abuse. For that kind of situa-
tion, you need to get help. But sometimes it’s difﬁcult to know if you’re being emotionally
abused. So, if you’re not sure if your partner is being abusive, consult with a mental health
professional.
Worksheet 16-5 contains examples of criticisms with corresponding defusing responses. In
each defusing response, a section appears in italics to show you which part of the criticism
is valid and acknowledged by the person being criticized. For the last three criticisms in the
worksheet, ﬁll in the defusing responses that you think would be most effective.

all your relationships will go more smoothly if you master the technique.
After you put the defusing technique as well as the checking it out technique (see the pre-
ceding section) to the test in your own relationships, reﬂect on how these alternatives to
defensiveness and counterattacking have worked for you. Did you ﬁnd that checking it out
revealed that your partner indeed was being hostile? Or did you discover that your partner
wasn’t intending to inﬂict hurt or criticism? In either case, did checking it out keep things
from escalating like they usually do? When you tried to defuse your partner’s comments,
did the potential conﬂict seem to deﬂate? Record your reﬂections in Worksheet 16-5.
Worksheet 16-5
My Reﬂections
Discovering the Problem Isn’t All About You
When someone you care about is angry or distraught, you may think that the upset relates
to you in some way. This assumption is natural but not always correct. When you wrongly
take responsibility for your partner’s emotions, you engage in personalizing. And when you
personalize, you’re likely to feel distressed and just may become defensive or counterattack
(see “Overriding Defensiveness” for more on those reactions).
It’s often the case that when people get upset, it has very little to do with you — even if they
say it does! What? How can that be? Truth is, most of the time, people have intense emotions
about events because one or more of their personal hot buttons have been pushed. These
hot buttons are what we call problematic life-lenses (check out Chapter 7 for a full explana-
tion). They’re the core beliefs that people have about themselves and the world, and they
arouse a lot of emotion.
224
Part V: Relationship Therapy 

If you can identify what your partner’s hot buttons are, you can understand what triggers
his or her anger and other heightened emotions. It also helps to know that your partner’s
upset has more to do with problematic life-lenses than with you. Understanding problematic
life-lenses allows you to depersonalize the event, which in turn leads you to feel a little
empathy rather than defensiveness.
If you haven’t done so already, we recommend that you ﬂip to Chapter 7 and get to the
bottom of your own problematic life-lenses. If you already worked through Chapter 7, we
suggest you go back and review it now. Understanding your own issues is as important as
understanding your partner’s.
It’s time to ﬁgure out which of the problematic life-lenses listed in Worksheet 16-6 apply to
your partner.
1. Read over the problematic life-lenses in Worksheet 16-6.
2. Think about your partner and how he or she reacts to life events.
3. Rate each lens based on how it describes your partner’s behavior and reactions to
life events. Use a scale of 1 to 5 for your frequency rating: 1 for almost never, 2 for
occasionally, 3 for sometimes, 4 for usually, and 5 for almost always.
You may discover that your partner has seemingly contradictory life-lenses, such as
feeling both perfectionistic and at times inadequate. Don’t worry; combinations are
fairly common.

If you rated your partner as having a 3 or above on any of the problematic life-lenses in this
table, you’ve found a hot button. Life happenings that tie into those life-lenses are likely to
produce strong emotions — and the intensity of those emotions probably has more to do
with your partner’s life-lens than with you. Keeping track of when your partner becomes
upset and ﬁguring out which problematic life-lens is involved is always a good move because
knowing this connection may not make you feel good about your partner’s upset, but at
least you can understand what’s going on and perhaps let it go with more ease.
Isabelle has a hot temper. She gets angry about almost anything that goes wrong, and even
small stuff gets her really worked up. Isabelle’s partner, Lisa, blames herself when Isabelle
goes off on one of her tirades. Lisa completes the problematic life-lens questionnaire on
Isabelle’s behaviors (see Worksheet 16-6) and discovers that Isabelle appears to look through
the lenses perfectionistic, help-avoidant, and vulnerable. It’s no wonder she gets upset so
easily! With that information in hand, Lisa tracks Isabelle’s life-lenses over a variety of life
events (see Worksheet 16-7), and reﬂects on her ﬁndings (see Worksheet 16-8).

Lisa’s Reﬂections
I really see now that I’ve been beating myself up over what are really Isabelle’s
problems. I can tell that she gets really pissed off when she’s afraid, and she
turns it all on me. Her perfectionism drives her nuts whenever the slightest
thing goes wrong. And she hates asking for help on anything. I don’t much like
her tirades, but at least I can depersonalize them a little. I understand now that
her anger isn’t all about me. I don’t deserve to be treated like this. I’m going to
work up the courage to tell Isabelle that she needs some help with these
issues, and I may suggest we go to couples counseling as well.
Use the following instructions to understand and depersonalize your partner’s hot button
reactions.
1. After you ﬁgure out your partner’s problematic life-lenses (see Worksheet 16-6),
observe him or her in action over the next few weeks.
2. When you notice your partner expressing strong, negative emotions, write down the
event that appeared to trigger the reaction in the left-hand column of Worksheet 16-9.
3. In the middle column, record your partner’s emotions and overall reactions.
4. In the right-hand column, write down your partner’s problematic life-lens that
relates to his or her emotions and reactions to that particular event.
5. Use Worksheet 16-10 to reﬂect on your observations. Try to depersonalize your part-
ner’s behavior and let some of your own upset go.

Talking About the Tough Stuff
As we explain in Chapter 15, communication is the foundation of any good relationship. In
that chapter, we give you tools for sharing experiences and positive feelings. In this chapter,
we tell you how to talk about dicier issues, such as concerns, disagreements, and dissatis-
factions. After all, sometimes people just need to discuss this stuff. Unfortunately, most
people don’t know how to do that very well. Our two strategies for helping you express the
tough stuff are I Messages and buffering.
Shifting the focus with I Messages
When you want to communicate concerns or dissatisfaction, the language you use makes a
big difference in how heated your communication becomes. If you’re critical or blaming,
you’re likely to produce defensiveness or a counterattack in your partner. I Messages state
your concerns in terms of how they affect you and don’t blame or accuse your partner of
anything. To use this technique, you clearly state how you feel about an issue; you know
you’re giving an I Message when you start your communication with the word “I” instead of
“you.”
Don’t expect to master the I Message technique quickly or easily because the natural, per-
haps instinctive response is to lash out. Thus, I Messages take lots of rehearsal and practice.
Worksheet 16-11 lays out several examples of blaming messages accompanied by alternative
I Messages. Read through the examples, and then come up with your own I Messages for the
blaming messages at the bottom of the list.

You charge way too much 
on the credit cards.
You never put your dishes 
in the dishwasher!
You’re always late.
You don’t appreciate all the 
things I do around here.
Of course it is possible that I Messages could lead to a negative response by your partner.
They simply improve your odds as compared to blaming and complaining “You Messages.”
You can make your I Messages even more effective by not only expressing what you feel but
also stating your concern gently.
Softening the blow through buffering
When you communicate negative or critical concerns, you have basically two choices: 
You can smash your partner over the head, or you can soften the blow. Guess which one
works best?
Like buffered aspirin, buffering reduces the acidity in your communications. To buffer, you
add a phrase that conveys the possibility that your position may not be entirely correct or
that your reaction may be a little excessive. We know, we know — you may feel you’re
undoubtedly 100 percent correct, but it never hurts to cover your conﬁdence a bit. Even if
you’re totally in the right, buffering can help.
Take a look at buffered and unbuffered concern examples in Worksheet 16-12, and decide for
yourself which approach is more likely to lead to a productive exchange — that’s one in which
you have possible compromise and useful conversation. After reading through the examples,
ﬁll in your own buffered alternatives for the unbuffered concerns at the end of the list.
Combining your buffering with an I Message (see “Shifting the focus with I Messages” earlier
in the chapter) can convey your point even more effectively. The Buffering Strategy below
includes I Messages in addition to using buffered phrases that suggest your position may
not be entirely 100-percent correct.

e take you beyond getting better and help you 
prepare for possible difficulties in the road ahead.
Relapse of anxiety or depression is disturbingly common,
but you don’t have to sit back and let it happen. We tell
you what you can do to prevent relapse or at least head it
off early on.
Finally, we turn our focus to what makes people happy.
After all, we don’t want you to just get over your emo-
tional distress; we want you to feel true joy from your life.
That’s why we provide exercises that focus your efforts on
finding meaning, purpose, and fulfillment.

Chapter 17
Reining In Relapse
In This Chapter
 Determining the risk of relapse
 Looking out for relapse signs
 Taking steps to catch and deal with relapse early on
T
he good news about anxiety and depression is that they’re both highly treatable disor-
ders. Typically, you can expect treatment efforts, either on your own or in conjunction
with professional help, to improve your moods and emotions considerably. The bad news is
that relapse is common. But there’s a lot you can do to prevent relapse and get better
quickly should it occur.
If you’ve made a substantial improvement in your anxiety or depression and you want to
hold onto your gains, this is the chapter for you. In this chapter, we help you ﬁgure out if
you’re at risk for relapse. Watching for relapse signs allows you to nip problems in the bud
before they overwhelm you. We also give you a couple of strategies for preventing relapse
from occurring in the ﬁrst place.
If you’ve worked (really worked, that is) through the rest of this book and your moods
remain anxious or depressed, this is not the chapter for you. Seek professional help if you
haven’t improved or you’re struggling more than you’d like. However, if you’ve improved
but not gotten to the point of recovery you’d like to be at, keep doing more of what you’ve
been doing.
Sizing Up Your Risk of Relapse
If your main problem is depression, your risk of relapse is particularly high. In fact, if you
treated your depression only with medication, your risk of relapse exceeds 50 percent over
the next couple of years. Anxiety poses a somewhat lower relapse risk.
Studies indicate that cognitive behavior therapies (those that focus on changes in thinking
and behaving), which are the basis for most of this book, work. Not only do these therapies
work, they appear to signiﬁcantly reduce relapse risk. So the bottom line is that if all you’ve
tried is medication, we recommend you embrace the skills we give you throughout this
book and/or see a therapist trained in cognitive behavior therapy.
You’re probably wondering how much risk you actually have for relapse. To ﬁgure out your
risk, check off the items in Worksheet 17-1 that pertain to you.

Worksheet 17-1
Relapse Risk Quiz
❑
1. I am completely over my anxiety or depression. I have no fear it will return.
❑
2. I have been previously depressed more than once in my life.
❑
3. I have had bouts of anxiety off and on for years.
❑
4. I have only taken medication for my problems.
❑
5. I suffer from a chronic illness.
❑
6. I have had some big ﬁnancial problems lately.
❑
7. I recently lost someone I care deeply about through breakup or death.
❑
8. I recently experienced a traumatic event.
❑
9. I lost my job not long ago.
❑10. I just retired.
❑11. There’s been an increase in family conﬂict lately.
❑12. I just graduated from high school or college.
❑13. When I get depressed or anxious, I know it’s entirely my fault.
❑14. I can’t control my moods at all.
❑15. I need people to like me in order to be happy.
You may think that checking off the ﬁrst statement in the list reduces your risk of relapse.
Wrong. Surprisingly, overconﬁdence has been found to be a risk factor for relapse. In other
words, a little optimism is a good thing, but you need to temper that optimism with realism.
Knowing that you have some risk of relapse is vital to helping you deal with early signs.
If you checked any statements at all in the Relapse Risk Quiz, you’re at increased risk for 
the return of emotional distress. Checking more than two or three statements puts you at
extremely high risk.
Depression and anxiety should be treated until symptoms almost completely subside.
Therapy should extend for at least six or eight weeks after you experience a return to full
energy, appetite, sleep, and pleasure levels. Medication should be continued even longer —
six to twelve months after full remission of symptoms.
If you work through the exercises in this chapter and a relapse still occurs, don’t catastro-
phize. You’re not starting at square one. You have some skills, and you can apply them anew.
Or you can try one of the exercises that you haven’t gotten around to. If you can’t get out of
your funk on your own, you can always turn to professional help. You can feel better; don’t
just sit around and feel miserable.
Not Letting Relapse Sneak Up on You
With relapse, subtle signs may start to appear and go unnoticed. Then, suddenly, you ﬁnd
your problems have returned, possibly even worse than before.
We don’t want relapse to get the best of you, so we recommend that, after you’ve recovered
from anxiety or depression, you conduct a review of your emotions and feelings on a weekly
basis. Over time, you can reduce the frequency of these reviews to once every month or
two as your risk of relapse becomes less and less.

Worksheet 17-2), please read and work through the next two sections of this chapter. In
addition, we recommend that you go back and do more of whatever it was that reduced
your emotional distress previously.
Changes in energy, appetite, or sleep may be due to a physical problem. If you’re experienc-

physician.

So, are we trying to get you to worry about all the bad things that may happen to you? What
about our advice in Chapter 8 about the value of staying centered in the present? Well, you
raise a good point! Staying in the present is a good idea, but so is being reasonably prepared
for the future.
In order to be prepared, we suggest the Fire Drill Strategy. Take each event that you list as
worrisome in Worksheet 17-3 and ﬁgure out how you would cope if that event occurred.
First, review this example of the Fire Drill Strategy.
David recovered from a combination of anxiety and depression about two months ago. He’s
preparing to stop seeing his professional counselor from the past six months. Before ending
their sessions, David’s therapist suggests that David prepare for possible ﬁre, or the ﬂare-up
of one of his fears. The therapist has David ﬁll out the Fire Drill Strategy (see Worksheet
17-4) on one of David’s worries. David’s father and uncle both died of colon cancer in their
50s, and David’s now 51, so the fear of developing colon cancer is very real for him.
Worksheet 17-4
David’s Fire Drill Strategy
Situation: Fear of colon cancer
1. How would someone else cope with this situation?
I can’t deny that it would be incredibly tough. However, my father used the last
years of his life to get his affairs in order and spend time with his family. He also
was very helpful to many people in his cancer support group. I could do that. I
remember my uncle was very angry and seemed to suffer a lot more. I’d rather
be like my father.
238
Part VI: Looking Beyond Anxiety and Depression 

2. Have I dealt with something like this in the past? How did I do it?
When I was in college I came down with meningitis. I was really sick, and
everyone was very worried. I don’t remember being terriﬁed, though. I think I
could use the same acceptance I had then.
3. How much will this event affect my life a year after it occurs?
Actually, given that I get regular screenings, the odds are pretty good that it
won’t be affecting me much a year after diagnosis. I just may be catastrophiz-
ing about this issue.
4. Is this event as awful as I’m making it out to be?
Obviously not. There have been so many advances both in terms of catching it
early as well as treatment that I think I’d be okay. As for the slim chance that I’d
die, I guess I could deal with that, too. I’d have to.
5. Are there any intriguing, creative ways of dealing with this challenge?
I’ve been meaning to participate in the cancer walk-a-thon. Maybe I’ll get off
my behind (so to speak) and just do it. If I do get diagnosed, I’ll join the support
group like my Dad did. He seemed to really beneﬁt and help others at the 
same time.
After completing this exercise, David realizes that he can cope with even his worst fears.
Seeing the beneﬁt of the exercise, he also ﬁlls out a Fire Drill Strategy on several other prob-
lems that he may encounter down the road.
Using Worksheet 17-5, complete your own Fire Drill Strategy. Simply list your speciﬁc fear at
the top and answer the questions that follow. Fill out a questionnaire for each problematic
concern you identiﬁed in the Fuel for Emotional Fires Questionnaire (see Worksheet 17-3).

If you work hard and conquer your depression or anxiety, that’s great! But you still probably
experience minor bumps in the road. And some people fail to appreciate the things that are
going well for them. Are you one of those folks? Do you notice the activities that increase
your feelings of satisfaction and well-being?
240
Part VI: Looking Beyond Anxiety and Depression 

Doing the right things
The technique we explain in this section, the Satisfaction Tracker, is designed to track satis-
fying activities. Paying close attention to satisfying activities highlights what’s going right in
your life, and increasing your focus on your well-being improves your odds of preventing
relapse.
Cindy has had a tough year. She broke up with her boyfriend and was diagnosed with breast
cancer. Her physical recovery was excellent and rapid by most standards. However, as is
common with breast cancer survivors, Cindy suffered from depression off and on during her
ordeal. Now a year later, her depression has thoroughly abated. Cindy tracks her satisfying
activities as a way of solidifying her gains and preventing relapse (see Worksheet 17-7).

Disrupting satisfaction interrupters
Sometimes, activities that you anticipate being wonderful turn out to be just okay, blah, 
or downright downers. This kind of outcome may indicate that your satisfaction was sabo-
taged by a satisfaction interrupter. The culprit is usually a thought that steals your initial or
planned enjoyment of an activity. To understand satisfaction interrupters and their effects
on your experiences, check out the following example.
Austin loves golf and looks forward to playing in a weekend charity game. It’s a crisp, clear
day, and the course is beautiful. Austin is clearly the best player of his foursome. He expects
to have a really a great time. But as he plays, he ﬁnds himself having thoughts that interrupt
his good feelings. Therefore, after he’s ﬁnished his round of golf, Austin ﬁlls out a Satisfaction

Notice how Austin’s initial, satisfying thoughts were zapped by his satisfaction-interrupting
thoughts. These satisfaction-interrupting thoughts didn’t make Austin feel depressed (like
the thoughts discussed in Chapters 5, 6, and 7), but they robbed him of his good feelings.
When the joy in your life gets stolen in this manner, you’re be more susceptible to relapse.
So what can you do to hold onto your joy? Well, we have a strategy for dealing with satis-
faction interrupters. Check out Worksheet 17-11 to see how Austin uses the Satisfaction-
Interrupter Disrupter.
Worksheet 17-11
Austin’s Satisfaction-Interrupter Disrupter
Satisfaction-Interrupting Thought: Every time I have thoughts like this, I can hear my
mother telling me that I’ll never amount to anything.
1. What evidence do I have that either supports or refutes my satisfaction-interrupting
thought?
I’m doing ﬁne. I have a good job with lots of potential for advancement. My
mother has been wrong about so many things in my life that it’s almost funny.
2. If a friend of mine told me that he or she had this thought, would I think it sounded
reasonable or self-defeating?
I’ve had friends who are good golfers, and I’ve encouraged them to compete. If
my friend told me that he felt like a failure because of something his mother
said, I’d tell him to grow up and get over it.
243
Chapter 17: Reining In Relapse

3. Do I have experiences in my life that could refute this thought?
I’ve won several local golf tournaments. I can’t be that much of a loser. I don’t
have to be the world’s best golfer to get somewhere in life, but hey, I’m darn
good.
4. Is this satisfaction-interrupting thought distorted, and can I come up with a more
accurate replacement thought? (See Chapter 6 for more information on thought 
distortions.)
Clearly, thinking that my mother’s view has anything to do with reality is pretty
darn distorted. I’m overgeneralizing and dismissing evidence that shows I’m
doing great. I can replace my satisfaction-interrupting thought with, “I’m doing
great with my golf game. I don’t need to listen to my mother’s voice anymore.”
After Austin answers the Satisfaction-Interrupter Disrupter questions, he realizes that he
has been allowing distorted thinking to interfere with his pleasure.
Now that you’ve seen how it’s done, track your satisfaction-interrupting thoughts in
Worksheet 17-12.
1. In the left-hand column, use a few words to capture what should have been a satisfy-
ing event.
2. If you initially had satisfying thoughts about that event, record those in the middle
column. If you didn’t have such thoughts, leave this column blank.
3. Record your satisfaction-interrupting thoughts in the right-hand column. Remember,
these are any thoughts that somehow took away the pleasure you may have other-
wise felt.
Some people almost automatically sabotage their satisfaction with general beliefs such as,
“Fun is frivolous,” “I don’t deserve to have a good time,” or “I should be working.” These
thoughts stop satisfaction before it even begins. Look out for such beliefs in your own think-
ing, and read more about them in Chapters 7 and 11.

Chapter 18
Promoting Positives
In This Chapter
 Being thankful
 Reaching out to help others
 Forgiving and moving past your anger
 Finding meaning in everyday life
T
hroughout this book, we focus on ways to help you overcome depression and defeat
anxiety. We know that working through the exercises we lay out and trying the strate-
gies presented will improve your moods. You deserve to feel better, and if you already feel
pretty good, this chapter is for you.
In this chapter, we go beyond depression and anxiety and reach for true happiness. Why?
Because science tell us that happiness doesn’t just feel good — happy people have better
immune systems, live longer, have lower blood pressure, and have more empathy for others.
Happy people are also more productive and make more money. That’s a pretty good argu-
ment for ﬁnding happiness.
If happiness is such a good thing, you may wonder what exactly makes people happy.
Although happy people usually make a little more money, research shows that money alone
doesn’t lead to more happiness. Unless you’re in extreme poverty and struggling to put food
on the table, studies indicate that even winning a big lottery payout doesn’t increase happi-
ness for very long. And, surprisingly, power, youth, and good looks don’t seem to contribute
much at all to people’s reported happiness.
As psychologists, we see ﬁrsthand how often those with money, looks, and power suffer
from depression and anxiety. Basically rich, gorgeous, young, and powerful people are as
likely to be just as miserable as anyone else. That’s not to say you should give away all your
money, neglect your appearance, and quit your job! It’s just that having all those things
doesn’t lead to happiness.
So what does lead to happiness? In Chapter 11, we talk about the value of seeking what 
we call healthy pleasures. Simple healthy pleasures are very helpful for kick-starting better
moods, but they’re somewhat transitory. In this chapter, we present ideas for ﬁnding deeper,
longer-lasting satisfaction and well-being.
Focusing on Gratitude
You may have a grandmother or mother who suggests that you think about good things and
put aside the bad. That’s pretty good advice. The common-sense advice of our elders usu-
ally has more than a grain of truth to it. Truth is, concentrating on the good things in your
life and whatever ﬁlls you with a sense of gratitude can be surprisingly helpful to developing
your sense of well-being.

Keeping track of the things 
that make you grateful
Studies show that keeping track of what you appreciate or are thankful for improves mood,
sleep, and health. What’s really amazing is how easy it is to enhance your life-satisfaction in
this manner.
Janet had a bout of depression and recovered a few months ago. She carefully monitors
herself for signs of relapse and feels grateful that she seems to have beaten the blues.
Before terminating therapy, her therapist suggests that Janet count her blessings for a
while. So Janet ﬁlls out a Gratitude Diary; Worksheet 18-1 shows her ﬁrst week’s efforts.

Janet is surprised at how good it feels to track what makes her feel grateful for a few weeks.
She starts to exercise more than before, and she feels a deeper sense of satisfaction with
her life.
Using Janet’s Gratitude Diary as a guide, ﬁll out your own Diary in Worksheet 18-2.
1. On each day of the week, think of ﬁve things you feel grateful for that day. These
items can be very small, such as ﬁnding a great parking space, or more substantial,
such as your good health.
2. Write each item in the diary on its corresponding day, and reﬂect on how apprecia-
tive you feel that day.
3. At the end of the week, use Worksheet 18-3 to reﬂect on what you’ve learned as a
result of keeping tabs on what makes you feel grateful.
Consider continuing this exercise every week for a month and from time to time in the future.

Writing testimonials
One strategy for bringing gratitude into your life by writing testimonials was developed by
Dr. Martin Seligman, and we think it’s a great idea. Dr. Seligman conducted some research on
this technique and found that participants felt great after completing it.
Dustin has a lot to be grateful for. He conquered his social anxiety more than a year ago. His
college roommate, Jack, was instrumental in helping Dustin overcome his anxiety. Now, a
junior in college, Dustin is taking an upper-level psychology class. His professor suggests a
project called the Testimonial Exercise. The students are instructed to choose someone
from their lives who made a real difference and write out a testimonial to that individual.
The students are told to deliver the testimonial and read it to their selected person. In
Worksheet 18-4, you can read what Dustin writes about his roommate.
Worksheet 18-4
Testimonial Exercise
Dear Jack,
I was given the assignment of writing a testimonial to someone who has made
a difference in my life, and guess what? You’re it. I felt pretty weird about this at
ﬁrst, but the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. I don’t think I’ve
ever told you how much I appreciate what you did for me in helping me over-
come my social anxiety. That ﬁrst year of college was brutal for me. Your
friendship saved me from utter misery.
You took me under your wing and pushed me to do things I didn’t think I could.
And you were a role model for me. You taught me how to talk with women. We
had some pretty good times, didn’t we? But sometimes I would get pretty
down about my problems, and you’d kick me in the butt. You told me I needed
to get counseling. Oh how I didn’t want to hear that! But you were right. The
whole ﬁrst-year experience changed my life. I give you credit for so much.
My hat’s off to you, buddy. They don’t come any better than you. Your friendship
is incredibly valuable to me. And now before I make myself totally sick, I’d better
end this thing! But seriously, I appreciate all you did.
Your buddy,
Dustin

Use Worksheet 18-5 and the following instructions to complete your own Testimonial
Exercise.
1. Choose someone from your life who has made a real positive difference in your life.
Ideally, the person you choose shouldn’t be someone you’re romantically involved with.
2. Write at least two or three paragraphs expressing your gratitude and telling the
person what he or she did for you. Write out your testimonial in longhand — it’s more
personal that way.
3. Arrange a time to meet with the person to whom you wrote, and read your testimo-

Making the World a Bit Nicer
A powerful way of achieving happiness is through helping others. Being kind to others helps
you in two ways: First, you’re likely to enjoy the feeling you get from giving service or kind-
ness to others. Second, doing something nice for another person takes your mind off your
own problems.
To get you started, Worksheet 18-7 lists some possible good things you can do to help
others. It’s good to come up with your own list of things that are important to you, but for
more ideas, consider checking out www.actsofkindness.org.
Worksheet 18-7
Nice Ideas
❑Walk dogs at your local Humane Society
❑Offer to take someone else’s shopping cart back to the store
❑Volunteer to tutor someone
❑Volunteer to drive for a Senior Center
❑Offer to run an errand for a neighbor
❑Pick up litter in your neighborhood
❑Let another driver merge into your lane
❑Donate blood
❑Donate food or clothing to a homeless shelter
❑Write a thank-you note to someone
This exercise helps you discover the personal beneﬁts of small acts of kindness. Even in small
ways, you make the world a better place while simultaneously enhancing your own well-being.
1. Brainstorm a list of at least 20 small acts of kindness — things you could do almost
anytime. Write them in the left-hand column of Worksheet 18-8. The key is to think of
ideas that are truly gifts — in other words, you shouldn’t expect something in return. If
you want to include a few more substantial acts, that’s ﬁne; remember, the frequency of
your actions is what really makes the difference.
2. After you develop your list, start doing the things you’ve listed!
252

Letting Go
One way people ruin their chances for happiness is by holding on to resentments, anger,
and rage. When you’ve been wronged, it’s natural to feel upset, and anger can be useful, at
least for a while. Anger helps you defend yourself when attacked because it revs up your
body to right a wrong.
253
Chapter 18: Promoting Positives

However, anger that’s held for too long begins to poison your body and soul. Chronic anger
leads to high blood pressure, emotional disturbance, and a decrease in common sense. Thus,
when you’re angry, you simply can’t be happy.
But ridding yourself of chronic anger isn’t an especially easy task. You must do something
that feels rather counterintuitive: Somehow ﬁnd forgiveness for those who have wronged you.
There may be certain wrongs that you probably can’t realistically forgive. For example, you
may ﬁnd yourself unable to forgive acts of severe violence or abuse. In that case, an alterna-
tive approach is to let go of the anger and rage by ﬁnding acceptance. See Chapter 8 for ideas
on acquiring acceptance.
In Worksheet 18-10, we guide you through a series of steps for ﬁnding forgiveness and the
serenity that comes along with it.
Worksheet 18-10
Finding Forgiveness
1. Write down what has happened to you to make you angry. Be speciﬁc. Try to avoid
using words of rage and retribution; instead, describe the person and event in dis-
passionate terms. Review what you’ve written over and over until your feelings
about it begin to lessen.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
2. Try to put yourself in the offender’s shoes. Search for some understanding as to why
he or she may have carried out the offense against you. Was the offender or perpe-
trator afraid, misguided, depressed, defensive, lacking judgment, or purposefully
hurtful? Write down your ideas.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
3. Think of yourself as a forgiving person, not a victim. Describe how your life may be
different when you learn to let go of your anger and forgive.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
254
Part VI: Looking Beyond Anxiety and Depression 

4. When thoughts of revenge come into your mind, write down reasons for letting
them go. Remember that anger and rage harm you more than the perpetrator.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________

5. Consider writing a letter of forgiveness in the space below. You don’t have to send it
to the perpetrator, but you may ﬁnd comfort in discussing it with others.
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
Forgiving isn’t the same as saying that the wrong was okay. Forgiveness gives back the
peace that you had before the event occurred. And letting go of your anger allows you to
regain your previous happiness.
Exercising Self-Control
In pursuing happiness, avoiding the quick ﬁx is very important. Quick ﬁxes come in all shapes
and sizes — alcohol, drugs, chocolate, a new car, a better house, more clothes, blah, blah,
blah. Such things are ﬁne in moderation, of course, but they don’t create lasting happiness.
In fact, numerous studies demonstrate that in the long run, self-control and the ability to
delay gratiﬁcation lead to better adjustment and greater satisfaction with life. Yet we live in
a world that promises and encourages instant gratiﬁcation and suggests that you should be
happy at all times. Those expectations can easily set you up for disappointment. The truth
is that
 People aren’t always happy.
 Meaningful goals require effort and patience.
 Overindulgence leads to satiation and depleted pleasure.
 People who expect instant gratiﬁcation are inevitably frustrated and disappointed.
Worksheet 18-11 starts you on the path to achieving greater self-control. Even small steps in
this direction enhance your sense of well-being. Please realize you don’t have to make major
changes all at once, and most importantly, devote some serious time to this exercise to get
the best results.

Finding Meaning at Your Funeral
You probably think that your funeral would be a rather odd place to ﬁnd meaning in your
life, and you may wonder why a book purporting to provide help with emotional distress is
asking you to think about dying. Well, give us a minute here, okay? Let us explain.
Finding meaning and purpose in life is about connecting with ideas and concepts that are
larger and deeper than yourself. For many, religion and spirituality are the primary channels
for ﬁnding such meaning. But regardless of your spiritual beliefs, giving serious considera-
tion to what you want your life to be about, in other words, the legacy you want to leave
behind, can be an enlightening exercise.
In this section, we ask you to think about your funeral or memorial service and the thoughts
and feelings that those in attendance may experience when contemplating your life. What
do you want people to remember about your life? The following exercise helps you discover
the traits, characteristics, and values you hold most dearly. By reminding yourself to live
the rest of your life accordingly, you’ll feel more enriched and fulﬁlled.
Roland completes the Eulogy in Advance exercise as a way of enhancing the sense of mean-

that he hasn’t been living his life in a way that justiﬁes how he wants to be remembered.
Nevertheless, he writes out how he wants people to think of him and his life after he’s gone

Roland’s Eulogy in Advance
We are gathered here today to say goodbye to our friend and family member,
Roland. Roland was a wonderful father and husband. He loved and enjoyed
spending time with his family. Roland’s children grew up to be successful and
happy. He loved and cherished his wife throughout their marriage. He was
careful to keep the romance alive, even until the end. Roland was a true friend
to many of us here today. When someone needed help, Roland was the ﬁrst to
offer. His door was always open. Whether or not people needed his time or
even his money, Roland was generous. Roland also gave to his community; he
organized members of his congregation to pick up seniors who were unable to
drive so that they could attend church services and functions. Truly, he made
the world a little better place.

Roland sees a painful contrast between the life he’s been living and the one he wants to 
be remembered for. Thus, he realizes that he spends far too much of his time working and
buying unnecessary “stuff.” He doesn’t want people to recall that he was the ﬁrst on his
block to have a plasma television or that he leased a new car every year. Roland vows that
in the future, he’ll spend more time with his friends and family, and he makes a plan for con-
tributing more to his community. After all, he cherishes these values far more than all the
material prizes in the world.

Browsing Helpful Web Sites
The Internet gives you access to incredible amounts of information, good and bad, accu-
rate and inaccurate, so you need to be careful about what you read and put to use in your
situation. We can attest to the quality of the information and advice provided by the follow-
ing sites:
 American Psychiatric Association (www.psych.org/public_info): Provides informa-
tion about depression and other mental disorders.
 American Psychological Association (www.apa.org/pubinfo): Provides information
about the treatment of depression and other emotional disorders as well as interesting
facts about these topics.
 Anxiety Disorders Association of America (www.adaa.org): Lists self-help groups
across the United States. It also displays a variety of anxiety-screening tools for self-
assessment as well as an online newsletter and a message board. Because anxiety
sometimes accompanies depression, you may want to check this site out even if you
think you’re only dealing with depression.
 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (www.nami.org): A wonderful organization that
serves as an advocate for people and families affected by mental disorders. This site
provides information about the causes, prevalence, and treatments of mental disorders
that affect children and adults.
 National Institute of Mental Health (www.nimh.nih.gov): Reports on research con-
cerning a wide variety of mental health issues. This Web site supplies an array of
educational materials on depression as well as resources for researchers and practi-
tioners in the ﬁeld.
 WebMD (www.webmd.com): Provides a vast array of information on both physical and
mental health issues, including information about psychological treatments, drug ther-
apy, and prevention.

Participating in Support Groups
Sometimes it’s not a bad idea to seek out support from others who currently experience or
have experienced problems similar to your own. Check out your local newspaper for a listing
of support groups — you’ll probably be surprised at how many different groups you ﬁnd.
Be careful when it comes to the many Internet support groups that exist. Sometimes, rather
strange and disturbed people go to support group chat rooms and attempt to take advan-
tage of vulnerable people.
Checking In with Primary Care Doctors
Most family practitioners and internists don’t have specialized training in the treatment 
of emotional disorders. However, your anxiety and depression may be caused by physical
problems, and your physician can rule that possibility out. Furthermore, your primary care
doctor can refer you to the right mental health professionals.
Sharing with Psychiatrists
Psychiatrists have extensive training in diagnosing and treating mental disorders. Most psy-
chiatrists primarily utilize medication in treating these disorders, and they’re particularly
expert in the management of medications’ side effects. (See Chapter 14 for more informa-
tion about treatment through medication.) Some psychiatrists have specialized training in
psychotherapy techniques such as those reviewed in this book, so you should inquire
ahead of time if that’s the kind of help you’re looking for.
Getting a Hand from Psychologists
Psychologists typically have PhDs in psychology, which give them extensive training in the
diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. They primarily utilize psychotherapy, which
involves individual sessions during which you and your psychologist work together on
goals for overcoming your difﬁculties. For the best results, make sure your psychologist is
familiar with scientiﬁcally validated therapies such as those covered in this book. In a few
states, psychologists with additional, specialized training are allowed to prescribe medica-
tion as well.
Talking Things Through with Counselors
Most counselors have master’s degrees in counseling or psychology and have been trained
in the treatment and diagnosis of emotional disorders. Before you begin a treatment 
program, make sure that your counselor is familiar with scientiﬁcally validated psycho-
therapeutic techniques.
265
Chapter 19: Ten Resources for Help

Getting Extra Help from Social Workers
Social workers typically have master’s degrees in social work. They often specialize in help-
ing people access community resources, but many are trained in psychotherapy as well.
Before you begin a treatment program, inquire as to your social worker’s knowledge about
scientiﬁcally validated psychotherapies.
Taking Advantage of Community Centers
If your town has a university, medical school, or community mental health center, you may
be able to take advantage of any available mental health services, sometimes even at a
reduced cost or on a scale based on income. Students may provide the actual services, but
they’re usually closely supervised by experienced faculty.
Leaning on Family and Friends
Almost everyone turns to friends or family for help from time to time, and we certainly
encourage you to do so. Although your friends and family probably don’t have the expertise
to do more than support and listen to you, such support is invaluable in stressful times.
Avoid making your loved ones feel responsible for your mental health. Doing so may jeop-
ardize your relationship and won’t help you in the end. You must take charge of getting
better.
Considering the Best Options for You
Take some time to reﬂect on which of the resources above you wish to pursue. In Worksheet
19-1, jot down a statement of commitment to pursue your chosen resources. You may also
record notes here regarding your own investigation of these resources.

Chapter 20
Ten Quick Ways Out of Upset
In This Chapter
 Finding fast ﬁxes in a pinch
 Building your personal plan of attack
T
he ideas in this chapter are designed to give you a lift when you’re feeling a little down
or uptight. Mind you, we’re not talking about deep depression or intense anxiety —
that’s what the rest of the book is about. But if you’re feeling not quite yourself, you’re likely
to ﬁnd these tips useful.
Just Breathe
Typically, when you’re distraught, your breathing quickens and becomes shallow. These
changes in breathing are bound to add to your stress and make you more uncomfortable
than you already are. You can counter such distress with this quick breathing technique:
1. Place one hand on your abdomen and the other on your chest.
2. Breathe in slowly, concentrating on inﬂating your abdomen ﬁrst and then your
chest.
3. Exhale slowly, quietly saying the word “relax” as the air goes out.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for at least ten breaths.
Talk It Out
People are social creatures. When you connect with others, you’re likely to feel better. If
you’re feeling down, call a friend and discuss what’s bothering you. Or call someone just 
to chat. Whatever the reason you connect, it’s likely to help.
Get Soaked
Sitting in a warm bath or standing in a hot shower can comfort the body by loosening all
those muscles that tighten up when you’re stressed. (Hot tubs work pretty well, too, as do
saunas, but not everyone has one of these handy.) As you feel the water rushing over or
around you, think of yourself as wrapped up in a warm blanket. You’ll feel safe, soothed, 
and serene.

Feel the Big Chill
This technique sounds pretty weird, but it works. When your distress feels intense, ﬁll a
sink or large bowl with ice water (that’s right, ice water), take a deep breath, and immerse
your face in the water for 30 seconds or so. Believe us, it’s not as terrible as it sounds. This
calming technique is believed to work because it elicits what’s known as the body’s dive
reﬂex. When you’re in ice-cold water, the body slows its metabolism in order to spare vital
organs. A slowed metabolism reduces tension, so when your face is in ice water, your
metabolism slows, your tension goes down, and you stop fretting about the things that are
bothering you and your negative mind chatter ceases. As we said, it sounds weird, but we
urge you to try it!
Take a Quick Thought Challenge
To ﬁgure out exactly what’s bothering you and consider it in relation to the big picture of
your life’s events, answer the following questions. Note: This quick strategy works best if
you ﬁrst read Part II of this book.
1. What’s bothering me?
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
2. How important will this upset be to me in one year?
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
3. Do I have any evidence that would suggest my thoughts about the event are 
incorrect?
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________
4. Is there a more reasonable way of looking at what happened?

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Exorcise with Exercise
The body responds to upset by producing stress hormones. However, you can quickly burn
up those hormones by exercising at least 15 to 20 minutes. Try something aerobic such as
running, jogging, or brisk walking. If it’s a nice day, going outside gives you the added bene-
ﬁt of sunshine and fresh air. Or if it’s more convenient, go to the gym and participate in an
exercise class.
Mellow with Music
Sound inﬂuences the mind and body. It can jar, startle, upset, or soothe you. When you feel
distressed, try listening to music that you ﬁnd relaxing, whether classical, jazz, or even
heavy metal. (For us, listening to heavy metal would send us into a crazed tizzy, but what-
ever works for you is what you should turn to.) Or you may listen to something pleasant
and mellow but nonmusical, such as a fountain or the sounds of nature.
Pacify with Pets
Studies have shown that pets promote better moods and possibly better health. In fact, one
study suggests that petting dogs helps reduce blood pressure. Therefore, if you don’t have 
a pet, consider getting one, or at least borrowing a friend’s from time to time. Watching ani-
mals play is delightful, and petting them seems to soothe the body.
Distract Your Distress
When you’re upset, usually the only thing on your mind is your discomfort. And focusing 
on that discomfort only makes things worse. We’re not advocating putting your head in the
sand, but for quick relief of minor stress, consider distraction. Try these activities:
 Reading a good novel.
 Going to the movies.
 Watching television.
 Surﬁng the Internet.
 Playing a game.
Stay in the Present
Remember that most of what upsets you has to do with the past or the future. You may feel
guilty and depressed about events from the past, and you may feel anxious about events
that have not yet occurred and often never will. To snap yourself out of this trap, focus on
what’s actually happening around you right now. Notice your breathing. Feel your feet on
the ground. Notice the ﬁrmness of your chair. Pay attention to the temperature. Look
around you and observe. Don’t judge. Just observe, and breathe.
