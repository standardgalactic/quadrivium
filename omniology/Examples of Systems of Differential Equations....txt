Introduction
Introduction
Here we present a collection of examples of general systems of linear diﬀerential equations and some
applications in Physics and the Technical Sciences. The reader is also referred to Calculus 4b as well
as to Calculus 4c-2.
It should no longer be necessary rigourously to use the ADIC-model, described in Calculus 1c and
Calculus 2c, because we now assume that the reader can do this himself.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

is a solution of (1).
2) Are the vectors in (2) linearly dependent or linearly independent?

be done?

and the equation is fulﬁlled.
It follows from Example 1.1 that the complete solution of the homogeneous system of equations is
given by


cosh t

+ c2


Due to the linearity, the complete solution of the inhomogeneous system of diﬀerential equations is
given by


If we put t = 0 into the complete solution, we get

Homogeneous systems of linear differential equations
Example 1.3 Find that solution z1(t) = (x1, x2)T of
(3)
d

 x1
x2

=
 1
−1
1
1
  x1
x2

,
which satisﬁes z1(0) = (1, 0)T .
Than ﬁnd that solution z2(t) of (3), which satisﬁes z2(0) = (0, 1)T .
What is the complete solution of (3)?
1) The complete solution.
a) The “fumbling method”. The system is written
 dx1/dt = x1 −x2,
dx2/dt = x1 + x2,
thus in particular x2 = x1 −dx1
dt .
By insertion into the latter equation we get
dx2
dt = dx1
dt −d2x1
dt2 = x1 + x2 = x1 + x1 −dx1
dt ,
hence by a rearrangement,
d2x1
dt2 −2 dx1
dt + 2x1 = 0.
The characteristic polynomial R2 −2R + 2 has the roots R = 1 ± i, so we conclude that the
complete solution is
x1 = c1et cos t + c2et sin t,
c1, c2 arbitrary.
It follows from
dx1
dt = (c1 + c2)et cos t + (c2 −c1)et sin t,
that
x2 = x1 −dx1
dt = −c2et cos t + c1et sin t.
Summing up we get
(4)
 x1
x2

=

c1et cos t+c2et sin t
−c2et cos t+c1et sin t

=c1et
 cos t

+c2et

sin t
−cos t

,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
b) Alternatively we apply the eigenvalue method. From

1 −λ
−1
1
1 −λ
 = (λ −1)2 + 1 = 0
we obtain the complex conjugated eigenvalues λ = 1 ± i.

A complex eigenvector for e.g. λ = 1 + i is the “cross vector” of (1 −λ, −1) = (−i, −1), thus
e.g. v = (1, −i).
A fundamental matrix is
Φ(t) =

Re

e(a+iω)t(α + iβ)
	
| Im

e(a+iω)t(α + iβ)
	
= eat cos ωt(α β)+eat sin ωt(−β α).
Here,
λ = 1 + i = a + iω,
α =
 1
0

,
β =

0


,
so
Φ(t) = et cos t

The complete solution is
x(t) = Φ(t)c = c1et

cos t
sin t

+ c2et

sin t
−cos t

,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
c) Alternatively we can directly write down the exponential matrix,
exp(At)
=
eat 
cos ωt −a
ω sin ωt
	
I + 1
ω eat sin ωt · A
=
et(cos t−sin t)


+ et sin t
 1


= et
 cos t
−sin t

,
so the complete solution becomes
x(t) = exp(At)c = c1et
 cos t
sin t

+ c2et
 −sin t
cos t

,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
d) Alternatively (only sketchy) the eigenvalues λ = 1 ± i indicate that the solution necessarily
is of the structure

x1(t) = a1et cos t + a2et sin t,
x2(t) = b1et cos t + b2et sin t.
We have here four unknown constants, and we know that the ﬁnal result may only contain
two arbitrary constants. By insertion into the system of diﬀerential equations we get by an
identiﬁcation that b1 = a1 og b2 = −a2, and we ﬁnd again the complete solution
 x1
x2

=
 a1et cos t + a2et sin t
a1et sin t −a2et cos t

= a1et
 cos t
sin t

+ a2et

sin t
−cos t

,
where a1 and a2 are arbitrary constants.
2) By using the initial conditions z1(0) = (1, 0)T in e.g. (4) we get

1
0

= c1

1
0

+ c2

0
−1

,
thus c1 = 1 and c2 = 0, and hence
z1(t) =

et cos t
et sin t

.

3) By inserting the initial conditions z2(0) = (0, 1)T into e.g. (4), we get
 0



,
thus c1 = 0 and c2 = −1, hence
z2(t) =
 −et sin t
et cos t

.
4) The complete solution has already been given i four diﬀerent versions in (1).

1) The eigenvalue method. It follows immediately that the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = −2.
To the eigenvalue λ1 = 1 correspond the eigenvectors which are proportional to (1, 0).
To the eigenvalue λ2 = −2 corresponds the eigenvectors which are proportional to (1, −3).

3) Alternatively the system is written (the “fumbling method”),
dx1
dt = x1 + x2,
dx2
dt = −2x2,
from which we immediately get x2 = c2e−2t.
Then by insertion
dx1

so
x1 = c1et + c2et

ential equations
dx
dt =

1) The eigenvalue method. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the following equation,

1 −λ
4
−2
−3 −λ
 = (1 −λ)(−3 −λ) + 8 = λ2 + 2λ + 5 = 0,
hence λ = −1 ± 2i.
A complex eigenvector corresponding to e.g.. λ = a + iω = −1 + 2i is a cross vector of
(1 −λ, 4) = (2 −2i, 4) = 2(1 −i, 2),
so we have e.g.
v = α + iβ = (2, −1 + i)T = (2, −1)T + i(0, 1)T .
Then a fundamental matrix is given by

The characteristic polynomial R2 + 2R + 5 has the roots R = −1 ± 2i, so the complete solution is
x1(t) = c1e−t cos 2t + c2e−t sin 2t.
We conclude from
dx1
dt = (2c2 −c1)e−t cos 2t + (−2c1 −c2)e−t sin 2t,
that
4x2 = dx1
dt −x1 = (2c2 −2c1)e−t cos 2t + (−2c1 −2c2)e−t sin 2t.

= −0, 76483 ± 1, 29339i.
If one insists on solving the equation, the “fumbling method” is here without question the easiest
one to apply. In fact, if we write the full system
 x′′′ = 3x −y + t2,
y′ = 2x + 4y + t3 + 1,
dvs. specielt y = −x′′′ + 3x + t2,
then it follows by insertion into the latter equation that
−x(4) + 3x′ + 2t = 2x −4x(3) + 12x + 4t2 + t3 + 1,
hence by a rearrangement
d4x
dt4 −4d3x
dt3 −3dx
dt + 14x = −t3 −4t2 + 2t −1.
The we guess a particular solution of the form of a polynomial of degree 3, at3 + bt2 + ct + d (the
coeﬃcients are really ugly), and since the characteristic polynomial is the same as before, we get the
complete solution
x(t) = at3 + bt2 + ct + d + c1eλ1t + c2eλ2t + c3eαt cos βt + c4eαt sin βt,
where we have λ3 = α + iβ and λ4 = α −iβ from above.
Then put this solution into
y = −x′′′ + 3x + t2.
One has to admit that this method is somewhat easier to apply than the “standard method” of ﬁnding
the eigenvectors ﬁrst.

 = (λ −1)(λ + 1) + 2 = λ2 + 1,
thus λ = ±i. Since the eigenvalues are complex numbers, we have four solution variants.
1) The eigenvalue method. To λ = a+iω = i, i.e. a = 0 and ω = 1, we have a complex eigenvector
of the form

2) The exponential matrix. Since the eigenvalues are complex conjugated, the exponential matrix
is given by a formula (a = 0 and ω = 1),
exp(At)

3) Since λ = ±i, the real structure of the solution is given by


b1 cos t + b2 sin t

,
hence


=

(a1−b1) cos t+(a2−b2) sin t
(2a1−b1) cos t+(2a2−b2) sin t

.
When we identify the coeﬃcients, we eliminate b1 and b2, thus
a2 = a1 −b1
and
−a1 = a2 −b2,
and hence
b1 = a1 −a2
and
b2 = a1 + a2.

where a1 and a2 are arbitrary constants.
4) The “fumbling method”. It follows from
dy1
dt = y1 −y2,
i.e.
y2 = −dy1
dt + y1,
dy2
dt = 2y1 −y2,
by eliminating y2 that
−d2y1
dt2 + dy1
dt = 2y1 + dy1
dt −y1,
hence by a rearrangement
d2y1
dt2 + y1 = 0.
Then we get the complete solution
y1 = c1 cos t + c2 sin t.
This gives us
y2
=
−dy1
dt + y1 = −(−c1 sin t + c2 cos t) + c1 cos t + c2 sin t

c1(sin t + cos t) + c2(−cos t + sin t).

Y.
Obviously, λ = 1 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2. We have a couple of solution methods.
1) Discussion of the structure of the solution. The algebraic multiplicity is 2, while the geo-
metric multiplicity is only w. Hence the complete solution must necessarily have the structure
 y1

It follows by a couple of calculations that

When we identify the coeﬃcients we ﬁnd that
a1 + a2 = a1,
thus a2 = 0,
b1 + b2 = 2a1 + b1,
thus b2 = 2a1.
The two free parameters are a1 and b1, while a2 = 0 and b2 = 2a1, so

Example 1.11 Find the complete solution of the system
y′
1 = y2 + y3,
y′
2 = y1 + y3,
y′
3 = y1 + y2.
Here we also have a couple of solution possibilities.
1) The system can also be written
d

⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠=
⎛
⎝

⎛


= −λ3 + 1 + 1 + λ + λ + λ = −(λ3 −3λ −2).
We immediately guess the roots λ = −1 and λ = 2. Then we get by a reduction,
−(λ3 −3λ −2) = −(λ + 1)(λ −2)(λ + 1) = −(λ + 1)2(λ −2),
so λ1 = λ2 = −1 is a root of multiplicity w, and λ3 = 2 is a simple root.
If λ = −1, we get the following system of equations for the eigenvectors,
(A −λI)v =
⎛
⎝
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
⎞
⎠v = 0.
Two linearly independent vectors which satisfy these equations are e.g.
v1 = (2, −1, −1)
and
v2 = (1, 1, −2).
If λ = 2 then we get
(A −λI)v =
⎛
⎝

and we can e.g. choose the solution v3 = (1, 1, 1). The complete solution is

2) The “fumbling method”. It follows immediately of the symmetry of the equations that
d
dt(y1 −y2) = −(y1 −y2),
thus y1 −y2 = 3c1e−t,
d
dt(y2 −y3) = −(y2 −y3),
thus y2 −y3 = 3c2e−t,
hence by addition y1 −y3 = 3(c1 + c2)e−t. Finally,
d
dt(y1 + y2 + y3) = 2(y1 + y2 + y3),
thus y1 + y2 + y3 = 3c3e2t.
Hence we get
 2y1 + y3 = 3c1e−t + 3c3e2t,
y1 −y3 = 3(c1 + c2)e−t,
i.e.
y1 = (2c1 + c2)e−t + c3e2t,
y2 = (−c1 + c2)e−t + c3e2t,
y3 = (−c1 −2c2)e−t + c3e2t,

If λ = 1, then

2a + 4c = 0,
a + 2b = 0,
−2a −4c = 0,
thus

a = −2c = −2b,
(a, b, c) = c(−2, 1, 1).
If λ = −1, then
⎧
⎨
⎩
4a + 4c = 0,
−a = 0,
−2a −2c = 0,
thus a = c = 0, and b is a free parameter.
Thus we have found two linearly independent solutions. The third solution must have the structure
⎛

a1e−t + a2te−t

⎞
⎠.
We get by identifying the coeﬃcients that
3a1 + 4c1 = −a1 + a2,
thus 4c1 = −4a1 + a2,
−a1 −b1 = −b1 + b2,
thus b2 = −a1,
−2a1 −3c1 = −c1 + c2,
thus 2c1 + c2 = −2a1,
3a2 + 4c2 = −a2,
thus c2 = −a2,
−a2 −b2 = −b2,
thus a2 = 0,
−2a2 −3c2 = −c2,
thus c2 = −a2.
It follows from a2 = 0 that c2 = 0, hence c1 = −a1 = b2. Finally, b1 can be chosen freely.

The matrix is an upper triangular matrix, so it follows immediately by inspection that the two
eigenvalues λ = ±1 both have multiplicity 2. It also follows immediately that y4 and y3 must have
the simpliﬁed structure

It follows immediately from these equations that

b1 = a2.
Then the equations are reduced to

k = −2a4 + k,
hence

a4 = 0 = a3,
thus c3 = −k −b3.
Let the free parameters be a1, a2, b3 and k. Then
a3 = a4 = 0,

so the eigenvalues are λ1 = −1 and λ2 = 7.
Once the characteristic polynomial has been found, there are several ways to continue. We shall here
give some variants.
First variant. The eigenvalue method. The eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue λ is a
cross vector to (1 −λ, 3).
If λ1 = −1, then we e.g. get v1 = (3, −2)T .
If λ2 = 7, then we e.g. get v2 = (1, 2)T .

Second variant. Discussion of the structure of the solution. The solution must necessarily
have the structure

x1


=

ae−t + be7t
ce−t + de7t

,
where we shall eliminate two of the parameters. We ﬁrst calculate
d


=
 (a + 3c)e−t + (b + 3d)e7t
(4a + 5c)e−t + (4b + 5b)e7t

.
Now, e−t and e7t are linearly independent, so we get by an identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients that

−a = a + 3c,
−c = 4a + 3c,
og

7b = b + 3d,
7d = 4b + 5b,
hence 2a + 3c = 0 and 2b = d.
It follows that we may choose a = 3, c = −2, and b = 1, d = 2, and then we obtain the complete
solution

where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Third variant. The fumbling method. We expand the system,

dt = x1 + 3x2,
dvs. x2 = 1

λ1 −λ2

λ1 −λ2


.
Fifth variant. (Sketch). It is also to ﬁnd the exponential matrix by using its structure
exp(At) = ϕ(t)I + ψ(t)A,
ϕ(0) = 1,
ψ(0) = 0,
and by checking the matrix diﬀerential equation,
d
dt exp(At) = A exp(At)
and ﬁnally apply Caley-Hamilton’s equation,
A2 −6A −7I = 0,
dvs. A2 = 6A + 7I.
However, if one does not use some clever calculational tricks, one may easily end up in a mess of
formulæ, so this variant is not given here in all its details.

The eigenvectors. An eigenvector v is a cross vector to 2 −λ, 3)
If λ = 5, then we get a cross vector (−3, 3), so we may choose v1 = (1, 1).

It follows from the latter equation that
(5) x1 = dx2
dt + 3x2,
hence by insertion into the former one,
dx1
dt = d2x2
dt2 + 3dx2
dt = x1 + 5x2 = dx2
dt + 8x2.
Then by a rearrangement
d2x2
dt2 + 2dx2
dt −8x2 = 0.
The characteristic equation R2 + 2R −8 = 0 has the roots R = 2 and R = −4, so
x2 = c2e2t + c2e−4t.
If we put this into (5), we get
x1 = dx2
dt + 3x2 = (2c1e2t −4c2e−4t) + (3c1e2t + 3c2e−4t) = 5c1e2t −c2e−4t.

1) If λ = 2, then an eigenvector is a cross vector to (1 −λ, 2) = (−1, 2), so we get e.g. (2, 1) as an
eigenvector.

2) The eigenvalue method. We have previously found the eigenvalues λ = 2 and λ = −5. We
choose an eigenvector as a cross vector to
(1 −λ, 2)
or to
(3, −4 −λ).
To λ = 2 corresponds e.g. the eigenvector v1 = (2, λ −1) = (2, 1).
To λ = −5 corresponds e.g. the eigenvector v2 = (−4 −λ, −3) = (1, −3).
Then a fundamental matrix is
Φ(t) =

We shall here give four variants.
1) The fumbling method. In the actual case this is the simplest variant. It follows immediately
from the system of equations that
dx1
dt = dx2
dt = dx3
dt = x1 + x2 + x3,
hence (by some conveniently chosen constants)
x2 = x1 + 3c2,
x3 = x1 + 3c3,
and
d
dt(x1 + x2 + x3) = 3(x1 + x2 + x3).
We obtain from these equations that
x1 + x2 + x3 = 3x1 + 3c2 + 3c3 = 3c1e3t,

hence
⎧
⎨
⎩
x1 = c1e3t−c2−c3,
x2 = c1e3t+2c2−c3,
x3 = c1e3t−c2+2c3,
and thus
⎛

⎠= c1e−3t

⎠+ c2
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠+ c3
⎛
⎝

⎠.
2) The standard method. The eigenvalues of the matrix are the solutions of the equation
0 =

1 −λ

1 −λ

1
1
1 −λ

= (1 −λ)3 + 2 −3(1 −λ) = −λ3 + 3λ2 = −λ2(λ −3).
It follows that λ = 3 is a simple root and that λ = 0 is a double root. Since the matrix A is
symmetric, its algebraic multiplicity is equal to its geometric multiplicity for λ = 0.
Let y = (y1, y2, y3) be an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 3, thus
3
⎛
⎝
y1
y2
y3
⎞
⎠=
⎛
⎝
y1 + y2 + y3
y1 + y2 + y2
y1 + y2 + y3
⎞
⎠.
It follows immediately that y1 = y2 = y3, so we may choose (1, 1, 1) as an eigenvector.
If λ = 0 we get analogously the condition
y1 + y2 + y3 = 0,
which describes a plane in space.
We shall only choose two linearly independent vectors, the
coordinates of which satisfy this condition. This may be done in several ways. If we e.g. choose
(1, −1, 0) and (1, 0, −1), then we get the complete solution
x(t) = c1e3t
⎛
⎝
1

⎛
⎝
1

⎠+ c3
⎛
⎝

⎠.
3) Calculation of the exponential matrix. It follows immediately that
A =

⎝

A2 = 3A, . . . , An = 3n−1A,

Remark 1.1 The three solutions are of course equivalent, even though the constants do not
correspond here.
4) Cayley-Hamilton’s theorem. We prove as in (2) that the characteristic polynomial is
(−1)3 det(A −λI) = λ3 −3λ2 = λ2(λ −3).
The corresponding diﬀerential equation
d3x
dt3 −3d2x
dt2 = 0
has the complete solution x(t), where
x(t) =
c1 + c2t + c3e3t,
x′(t) =
c2 + 3c3e3t,
x′′(t) =
9c3e3t.
The initial conditions are
x(j)
i (0) = δij
for i, j = 0, 1, 2.
If i = 0, then
⎧
⎨
⎩
c1 + c3 = 1,
c2 + 3c3 = 0,
9c3 = 0,
thus
⎧
⎨
⎩
c1 = 1,
c2 = 0,
c3 = 0,
hence x0(t) = 1.
If i = 1, then
⎧
⎨
⎩
c1 + c3 = 0,
c2 + 3c3 = 1,
9c3 = 0,
thus
⎧
⎨
⎩
c1 = 0,
c2 = 1,
c3 = 0,
hence x1(t) = t.
If i = 2, then
⎧
⎨
⎩
c1 + c3 = 0,
c2 + 3c3 = 0,
9c3 = 1,
thus
⎧

c1 = −1/9,

c3 = 1/9,
hence

2) Alternatively one may only use real calculations. In fact, since λ = −1

We know that we have two arbitrary constants in the ﬁnal solution, and here we have got four
unknowns a1, a2, b1, b2, so we still have to eliminate two of them by means of the diﬀerential
equation. Now,

We shall not calculate the latter two equations from the second row. One may if necessary use
them as a control.

The inhomogeneous equation. Even if one should know a fundamental matrix, it cannot be rec-

We get by an identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients,
a2 + b1 = 1,
−a1 + b2 = 0,
b2 −a1 + b1 = 0,
−b1 −a2 + b2 = 1,

Finally, the complete solution is obtained by adding all solutions of the homogeneous equation found
previously. Since this will give us a mess of formulæ, we shall not produce it here).

1) The eigenvalues are the roots of the polynomial

−3 −λ
4
−2
1 −λ
 = (λ + 3)(λ −1) + 8 = λ2 + 2λ + 5 = (λ + 1)2 + 4,
hence the complex eigenvalues are λ = −1 ± 2i.
2) The corresponding complex eigenvectors are cross vector to anyone of the rows in the matrix


.
It follows from the ﬁrst row, (−2 ∓2i, 4) = 2(−{1 ± i}, 2) that
v1 = (2, 1 + i)T
for λ1 = −1 + 2i,
v2 = (2, 1 −i)T
for λ2 = −1 −2i.

3) If λ1 = a + iω = −1 + 2i, where a = −1 and ω = 2, then

⎠.
4) This fundamental matrix looks very complicated, so it does not invite one to apply the solution
formula.


=
 (3a −4c)t + (a + 3b −4d)
(2a −c)t + (2b + c −d)

.
Then by an identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients,
3a −4c = 2,
a + 3b −4d = 0,
2a −c = 1,
2b + c −d = 0.
We get from the ﬁrst and third equation
 3a −4c = 2,
2a −c = 1,
that
 a = 2/5
c = −1/5.
Then by a rearrangement and insertion into the second and the fourth equation,
 3b −4d = −a = −2/5,
2b −d = −c = 1/5,
,
hence
 b = 6/25,
d = 7/25.
If this is put into our guess, we obtain our particular solution

5) It follows from the linearity that the complete solution is given by a particular solution to which

where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
6) Alternatives
a) Real calculations of the solutions of the homogeneous equation.
The eigenvalues
λ = −1 ± 2i are complex conjugated, so the structure of the solution of the homogeneous
equation is given by

x1
x2

= e−t

a1 cos 2t + a2 sin 2t
b1 cos 2t + b2 sin 2t

.
We get by a calculation,
d
dt

x1
x2

= e−t

(−a1+2a2) cos 2t+(−2a1−a2) sin 2t
(−b1+2b2) cos 2t+(−2b1−b2) sin 2t

,
and


 


(−3a1+4b1) cos 2t+(−3a2+4b2) sin 2t
(−2a1+b1) cos 2t+(−2a2+b2) sin 2t

.
When the coeﬃcients are identiﬁed, we get
−a1 + 2a2 = −3a1 + 4b1,
dvs. b1 = 1
2a1 + 1
2a2,
−2a1 −a2 = −3a2 + 4b2,
dvs. b2 = −1
2a1 + 1
2a2,
−b1 + 2b2 = −2a1 + b1,
dvs. a1 = b1 −b2,
−2b1 −b2 = −2a2 + b2,
dvs. a2 = b1 + b2.
We see that the four equations are consistent, and that the homogeneous equation has the
complete solution


(b1−b2) cos 2t+(b1+b2) sin 2t

corresponding to the fundamental matrix
Φ1(t) = e−t

.
Notice that Φ1(t) ̸= Φ(t) found previously. However, the two diﬀerent fundamental matrices
are of course equivalent.

which very conveniently gives

B2n = (−1)n · 22n · I
for n ∈N (og for n = 0).
Since I commutes with everything, we get

We note again that the fundamental matrix is diﬀerent from both Φ(t) and Φ1(t) found pre-
viously.
c) The fumbling method. We ﬁrst expand the system,
 dx1/dt = −3x1 + 4x2 + 2t,
dx2/dt = −2x1 + x2 + t.
If we use the ﬁrst equation to eliminate x2, it follows that
(6) 4x2 = dx1
dt + 3x1 −2t, med d(4x2)
dt
= d2x1
dt2 + 3dx1
dt −2.
Then the latter equation of the system is multiplied by 4,
d(4x2)
dt
= −8x1 + 4x2 + 4t,
and we get by an insertion,
d2x1
dt2 + 3x1
dt −2 = −8x1 +
dx1
dt + 3x1 −2t

+ 4t.
Then by a rearrangement,
d2x1
dt2 + 2dx1
dt + 5x1 = 2t + 2.
The characteristic equation R2 + 2R + 5 = 0 has the roots R = −1 ± 2i (the same as the
eigenvalues in the other variants).
We guess a particular solution of the form
x1 = at + b,
thus dx1
dt = a and d2x1
dt2 = 0.

Then by insertion,
2t + 2 = 0 + 2a + 5at + 5b = 5at + (2a + 5b).
When we identify the coeﬃcients, we get
 5a = 2,
dvs. a = 2/5,
2a + 5b = 2,
dvs. b = 1
5(2 −2a) = 6/25.
Hence,
x1 = 2
5t + 6
25 + c1e−t cos 2t + c2e−t sin 2t.
Now,
dx1
dt = 2
5 + (−c1 + 2c2)e−t cos 2t + (−2c1 −c2)e−t sin 2t,
so if we put this into (6), then
4x2
=
dx1
dt + 3x1 −2t
=
2
5 + (−c1+2c2)e−t cos 2t+(−2c1−c2)e−t sin 2t

5t + 18
25 + 3c1e−t cos 2t + 3c2e−t sin 2t −2t
=
−4
5t + 28
25 + (2c1+2c2)e−t cos 2t + (−2c1+2c2)e−t sin 2t,
whence
x2 = −1

25 + (1

so we can also write the system of equations in the following way,
 2b cos 2t −2a sin 2t = (a −c + 2) cos 2t + (b −d) sin 2t,
2d cos 2t −2c sin 2t = (−a −c) cos 2t + (−b −d + 1) sin 2t.
When the coeﬃcients are identiﬁed we get
2b = a −c + 2,
thus −a + 2b + c = 2,
−2a = b −d,
thus 2a + b −d = 0,
2d = −a −c,
thus a + c + 2d = 0,
−2c = −b −d + 1,
thus b −2c + d = 1.
It follows from the ﬁrst and the third equation that
b + c + d = 1,

which together with the fourth equation implies c = 0. This reduces the equations to

and then ﬁnally,
x2(t) = 1
6 sin 2t.
Second solution. The “fumbling method”. We shall actually only ﬁnd x2(t), so it would be
reasonable to eliminate x1(t). First we get from
dx1
dt = x1 −x2 + 2 cos 2t,
dx2
dt = −x1 −x2 + sin 2t,
that
x1 = −dx1
dt −x2 + sin 2t,
which when put into the ﬁrst equation gives
−d2x2
dt2 −dx2
dt + 2 cos 2t = dx2
dt −x2 + 2 cos 2t −x2 + sin 2t,
hence by a rearrangement,
(7) d2x2
dt2 −2x2 = −sin 2t,
x2(0) = 0
og
dx2
dt (0) = 1
3.
If we guess a particular solution of the structure x2 = a cos 2t + b sin 2t, we get
−6a cos 2t −6b sin 2t = −sin 2t,
hence a = 0 and b = 1
6, and we ﬁnd the particular solution
x2(t) = 1
6 sin 2t.
It is seen by inspection that it fulﬁls the initial conditions, and since the solution is unique, we have
solved the problem.
Alternatively the complete solution of (7) is given by
x2(t) = 1
6 sin 2t + c1e
√
2t + c2e−
√
2t.
It follows from the initial conditions that c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, hence the solution is
x2(t) = 1
6 sin 2t.

−λ
1
−2
−2 −λ
 = (λ + 2)λ + 2 = λ2 + 2λ + 2 = (λ + 1)2 + 1,
thus λ = a ± iω = −1 ± i where a = −1 and ω = 1.
We ﬁrst guess on a particular solution of the structure
 x1
x2


 a cos 2t + b sin 2t
c cos 2t + d sin 2t


c cos 2t + d sin 2t


,
we get from the system of diﬀerential equations and a multiplication with et that

(−a+2b) cos 2t−(2a+b) sin 2t = c cos 2t+(d+1) sin 2t,
(−c+2d) cos 2t−(2c+d) sin 2t = −2(a+c) cos 2t−(2b+2b+1) sin 2t.
When the coeﬃcients are identiﬁed it follows that
−a + b = c,
thus a −b + c = 0,
−(2a + b) = d + 1,
thus −2a −b −d = 1,
−c + 2d = −2(a + c),
thus 2a + c + 2d = 0,
−(2c + d) = −(2b + 2d + 1),
thus 2b −2c + d = −1.
We get from the second and the fourth equation that
−2a + b −2c = 0,
which together with the ﬁrst equation gives b = 0.
The system of equations is then reduced to
a + c = 0,
thus c = −a,
2a + d = −1,
thus 2a + d = −1,
2a + c + 2d = 0,
thus a + 2d = 0,

This can of course be found in many ways.
1) The eigenvalue method. We have already found the eigenvalues λ = a ± iω = −1 ± i where
a = −1 and ω = 1. An eigenvector corresponding to λ = −1 + i is a cross vector to (1 −i, 1), e.g.

3) Real structure of the solution. Since λ = −1 ± i, the solution must necessarily have the
following structure

x1

= e−t

a1 cos t + a2 sin t
b1 cos t + b2 sin t

.
Then by a calculation,
d


x1
x2

(−a1 + a2) cos t −(a1 + a2) sin t
(−b1 + b2) cos t −(b1 + b2) sin t

x1
x2


b1 cos t + b2 sin t
−2(a1 + b1) cos t −2(a2 + b2) sin t

.
When we identify the coeﬃcients we get
b1 = −a1 + a2,
b2 = −a1 −a2,
and (a little superﬂuous)
−b1 + b2 = −2(a1 + b1),
2(a2 + b2) = b1 + b2.
We have thus eliminated b1 and b2, hence the complete solution is

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

4) The “fumbling method”. The homogeneous system is expanded,
dx1
dt = x2
and
dx2
dt = −2x1 −2x2.
If we put the ﬁrst equation into the last one, it follows by a rearrangement,
d2x1
dt2 + 2dx1
dt + 2x1 = 0
med R2 + 2R + 2 = 0 for R = −1 ± i.
Hence
x1 = c1e−t cos t + c2e−t sin t
and
x2 = dx1
dt = c1e−t(−cos t −sin t) + c2e−t(cos t −sin t),
thus

The inhomogeneous term is a constant vector. Therefore, we guess on a particular solution as a

Alternatively we may apply the “fumbling method”. We expand the system,
⎧
⎨
⎩
dx1/dt = x1 + x2 + 1,
thus dx1/dt −x1 = x2 + 1,
dx2/dt = −2x1 −4,
thus dx2/dt + 2x2 = −4.
Clearly, the solution of the latter equation is
x2 = −2 + c2e−2t.
When this is put into the ﬁrst equation, we get
dx1
dt −x1 = −1 + c2e−2t,
hence
x1 = 1 + c2et

e−te−2t dt + c1et = 1 + c1et −1
3c2e−2t,
and summing up,
x(t) =

c1 + c2

Example 3.1 Consider a physical system consisting of two coupled oscillators. We assume that there
is no damper in the system. The three spring constants are k1, k and k2, and m1 and m2 denote the
masses of each of the two particles. At equilibrium we assume that the spring forces are 0. It can be
proved by Newton’s second law that the system can be described by the following system of diﬀerential
equations,
d2x1

m1
x1 = k
m1
x2
and
d2x2

x1(0) = 3 · 10−2,
x′
1(0) = 0,
x2(0) = 3 · 10−2,
x′
2(0) = 0.
Find x1(t) and x2(t) as solutions of a diﬀerential equation of fourth order.
By using the selected values of m1, m2 k, k1 and k2, we get

we get by an identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients that

where L, R and C are the induction coeﬃcient, the resistance and the capacity, resp..

The eigenvalues are the roots of the polynomial

so λ = 0 is a double root. It is not possible at this stage to conclude anything about the stability, so
we must necessarily solve the system.
It follows from Cayley-Hamilton’s theorem (cf. Linear Algebra) that A2 = 0, hence the series of

Example 4.9 Let (x, h)T denote a state vector (where h denotes the velocity of M, deﬁned below). A

Here the spring has the equilibrium length 0, and the error of the position governs the dependent

1) Find the characteristic polynomial of the system, and the values of e0, for which the system is
stable.
2) Assume that f(t) = F is constant and that the system is stable.
Find x1 = limt→∞x(t).
Is
x1 = x0?
3) Assume that f(t) is arbitrary for t ∈[0, t0[, while f(t) is 0 for t > t0. Find limt→∞x(t).

2) We shall ﬁnd a particular solution (x1, h1)T . If f(t) = F is a constant, we guess on a constant
vector (x1, h1). It follows from the former equation that
dx1

dvs. h1 = 0.
By insertion into the latter equation we obtain

The solutions of the homogeneous equation die out when e < krR
K , so the expression is equal to
limt→∞x(t). (Note that the denominator is < 0). It follows that this expression is only equal to
x0, if F = kx0.

The characteristic polynomial is
P(λ) = λ3 + 4λ2 + 4 = λ3 + 4λ2 + 0 · λ + 4.
The coeﬃcient of λ is 0, hence the system is not asymptotically stable.

By means of e.g. a pocket calculator we ﬁnd the approximate roots
λ = 0, 112085 ± 0, 966627i
eller
λ = −4, 22417.
Since there are roots with a positive real part, the system is unstable.
Alternatively we introduce the disturbance
Pε(λ) = λ3 + 4λ2 + ελ + 4.
Then all roots have a negative real part, if and only if ε > 0 and

4
4
1
ε
 = 4(ε −1) > 0
(Routh-Hurwitz’s criterion),
thus if and only if ε > 1. Since we here let ε →0, we again conclude that the system is unstable.
Alternatively the equation has a real root < 0 and two complex conjugated roots x ± iy. When we
put λ = x + iy, y ̸= 0, then
0 = (x + iy)3 + 4(x + iy)2 + 4 = {x3 −3xy2 + 4x2 −4y2 + 4} + i · y(3x2 −y2 + 8x).
Since in particular the imaginary part is 0, we must necessarily have that y2 = 3x2 + 8x, which when
put into the real part gives the necessary condition
0 = −8x3 −32x2 −32x + 4.
Since we have both positive and negative coeﬃcients, we must have a real and positive root, so the
system is unstable.
Example 4.11 It is well-known that a rigid body can be in a permanent rotation around any of
its principal axes (through a ﬁxed point of the body). However, the rotation around the axis of the
“middle” moment of inertia is not stable. Apply Euler’s equations and small variations of the velocity
of the angle to prove this.
Euler’s equations are
I1
dω1
dt + (I3 −I2)ω2ω3 = M1,
I2
dω2
dt + (I1 −I3)ω1ω3 = M2,
I3
dω3
dt + (I2 −I1)ω1ω2 = M3.
Assume that M1 = M2 = M3 = 0 and ω1 = ω0 + ξ1, ω2 = ξ2, ω3 = ξ3, where ξν are small
variations and ω0 is a constant (hence one consider a rotation around the ﬁrst principal axis and
small disturbances). By insertion into Euler’s equations, follows by a linearization we obtain a system
of ﬁrst order for ξν, the stability of which should be checked.
Putting M1 = M2 = M3 = 0 and ω1 = ω0 + ξ1, ω2 = ξ2, ω3 = ξ3 into Euler’s equations we get by
linearizations (this implies that we assume that the ξν-erne are so small that we can neglect terms of
higher order) that

Since ξ1 is a constant, we obtain stability (though not asymptotically stability), when
(I1 −I3)(I2 −I1)
I2I3

thus when
(I1 −I2)(I1 −I3) > 0.
For ﬁxed I2 and I3 this is only possible when I1 does not lie between I2 and I3. Therefore, if I1 is the
“middle” moment of inertia, then we have unstability.

then ﬁnd the complete solution of the homogeneous equation.
2) Then prove that (10) has periodical solutions which unlike the external force cos 2t does not have

3) Is it possible for a stable and linear system for a given external periodical force to have a periodical

1) Find a fundamental matrix of the system.
2) Is the system asymptotically stable?
3) Find the solution x(t) of the system, for which x(0) = (6, 0)T .

hence λ1 = 5 and λ2 = −1. The eigenvectors are cross vectors of (−1, 3 −λ).
If λ1 = 5, then e.g. v1 = (2, −1).
If λ2 = −1, then e.g. v2 = (4, 1).
The complete solution is

b) The fumbling method. We eliminate x1 by

Then
dx1
dt = −d2x2
dt2 + 3dx2
dt = x1 −8x2 = −dx2

2) When a = −4 and b = −1 the characteristic polynomial becomes
λ2−(5−1)λ−5+8 = λ2−4λ+3 = (λ−2)2−1 = (λ−1)(λ−3),
thus the roots are λ = 1 and λ = 3.
Since the matrix is A, given in (3), an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue λ is a cross
vector of (5 −λ, −4).
If λ1 = 1, then v1 = (1, 1)T .

Routh-Hurwitz’s criterion that the system is asymptotically stable.
b) Since the roots λ = −1
2 ± i
#

4 all have negative real part, the system is asymptotically stable.

(12)
hence a1 = 7, a2 = 23 and a3 = 17.
We have again two variants:
a) It follows from (11) that the roots are

They have all a negative real part, hence the system is asymptotically stable.

a1 > 0,
a2 > 0,
a3 > 0,

Then by Routh-Hurwitz’s criterion the linear system is asymptotically stable.

The characteristic polynomial is

−λ

−1
−2 −λ

= −λ2(λ + 2) −1 −λ = −{λ3 + 2λ2 + λ + 1},
thus
p(λ) = λ3 + 2λ2 + λ + 1 = λ3 + a1λ2 + a2λ + a3.
Now, a1 = 2 > 0, a2 = 1 > 0 and a3 = 1 > 0, and

a1
a3
1
a2
 =

 = 1 > 0,
so it follows from Routh-Hurwitz’s criterion that the system is asymptotically stable.
Remark 4.2 By using a pocket calculator it is seen that the roots are approximatively
λ1,2 = −0, 122561 ± i · 0, 744862,
λ3 = −1, 75488.

Example 5.3 Consider the linear system of diﬀerential equations of ﬁrst order

t ∈R.
1) Find the values of the constant a, for which there for every periodical exterior force u(t) of period
T exists precisely one periodical solution of (13) with period T.
2) Find a value of the constant a and a periodical exterior force u(t) of period T, such that
a) (13) does not have any periodical solutions of period T.
b) (13) has inﬁnitely many periodical solutions of period T.
Using the coordinates, (13) is written
dxj
dt = axj(t) + uj(t),
t ∈R.
Hence we may assume that the dimension is 1, so (13) is reduced to
dx
dt = ax(t) + u(t),

x(t) = ceat + eat

(a) u(t) = cos t,
(b) u(t) = 2 cos 2t,

1) The transfer function is given by
H(s) = cT (sI −A)−1b + d.
This expression is not deﬁned, if and only if s is an eigenvalue for A. In the given case we see
that H(s) is not deﬁned for s = −1 < 0, which lies in the left hand half plane, so the system is
asymptotical stable.
