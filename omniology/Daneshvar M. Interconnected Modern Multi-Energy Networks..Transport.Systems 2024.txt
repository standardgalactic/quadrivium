Preface
Modern grids aim at enabling modern functionalities (e.g., self-healing systems,
smart transportation systems, sustainable energy networks, and multi-dimensional
community of intelligence agents) and integrating smart technologies in the body of
multi-energy networks (MENs) aiming to supply more reliable and efficient energy.
In this context, transportation networks have recently experienced significant
growth in terms of vehicle systems, physical infrastructures, public transit system
management, autonomous vehicles, traveler information systems, and traffic man-
agement, to name a few. In this area, emerging new intelligent and hybrid energy
systems, along with the substantial development in energy conversion technologies,
as well as increasing demand for secure, comfortable, and reliable vehicle systems
declare the fact that modern grids need to include intelligent interconnected trans-
portation systems. Herein, diverse and intelligent transportation devices play a piv-
otal role in meeting the growing demand for vehicle systems that can be operated in
a collaborative manner to make the modern structure of the energy network more
efficient, reliable, resilient, and stable. However, how intelligent transportation sys-
tems (ITSs) can be interconnectedly operated for maintaining the sustainability of
cleaner modern MENs is a key question that needs to be addressed in deep detail.
As reliable transportation services are critical for future modern energy grids, a great
need is felt for sustainable intelligent interconnected transportation systems to sup-
port the system in realizing modern energy services goals under the cleaner and
modern structure of energy networks. As a pioneering book that presents the fun-
damental technologies and solutions for real-world problems in the context of intel-
ligent interconnected transportation systems, it covers a conceptual introduction to
modern transportation systems, highlights potential technologies and vehicle sys-
tems in this area, and discusses requirements for coordinated exploitation of modern
transportation systems. Moreover, the current book presents innovative ways for
interconnecting ITSs to ensure the sustainability of modern MENs with a high/full
share of renewable energy sources.

Introduction
In recent years, the growing need for all carriers of energy has driven energy
networks to be reconstructed in a way to effectively match energy supply and
demand [1]. In this transformation, grid modernization is introduced to pave
the realization of required changes that make the energy structure cleaner, more
efficient, affordable, sustainable, flexible, stable, and secure than the previous par-
adigm [2]. One of the prominent features of modernized energy networks is the
adoption of renewable energy sources (RESs) in energy generation premises [3].
This evolution is intended to facilitate the decarbonization plans for an energy
transition toward a carbon-free and green energy structure. However, such a
development was not only accompanied by economic and environmental benefits,
but also critical challenges have emerged, especially concerning uncertain outputs
of RESs [4]. Multi-energy systems along with other energy storage, management,
and energy trading technologies are proposed to address such challenges in the
modern energy grid [5]. However, effectively responding to such concerns requires
more than just using the mentioned solutions. Indeed, dynamic energy balancing
is more difficult from the network viewpoint when it is equipped with 100% RESs
given the stochastic nature of energy production. In such a circumstance, intercon-
necting different sectors of energy grids can make an appropriate multi-energy
coupling that supports the whole structure of the system in continuous energy
serving. One of these important sectors is transportation. The transportation

network encompasses different parts such as power lines, air routes, railways, and
road networks that possess diverse energy-consumed systems like electric vehicles
(EVs), buses, boats, etc. [6]. By including various energy-dependent devices, the
transportation network plays a vital role in energy interactions across the grid.
As future energy networks are planned to be eco-friendly infrastructure with fully
clean energy production [7], the transportation sector is also not exempt from this
green economy movement. Hence, exploiting carbon-free energy systems is nec-
essary for realizing a green transportation network. In this regard, recent advances
in the technology of multi-carrier energy devices offer great opportunities for gen-
erating, storing, and converting different carriers of energy to each other [8].
Therefore, the operation of coupled intelligent transportation networks and
multi-carrier energy units can procure appropriate conditions for implementing
net-zero emission plans and realizing a green transportation network. This issue
highlights the necessity for developing the application of multi-energy systems to
their usage in the transportation network. This chapter aims to further clarify var-
ious dimensions of this necessity.
1.2
Applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems
Recent years have witnessed a considerable rise in energy demand along with the
rapid development in the technologies of smart devices for smart grids. The
deployment of intelligent systems is not only limited to the residential sector,
but also the transportation premise has benefited in controlling a variety of energy
interactions. Such evolutions have driven the system to face huge volumes of data
generated by smart devices across the grid. This data is taken into account as val-
uable information for the decision-making process of the transportation network.
How the mentioned information needs to be used for managing various processes
as well as completing different duties is the main reason for creating transportation
management systems (TMSs). The TMS is from the area of transportation that sets
up for improving flexibility, load optimization, and effective route planning [9].
The utilization of machine learning (ML) techniques along with artificial intelli-
gence (AI) has made TMSs more intelligent, enabling them to achieve accurate
performance. The emergence of intelligent devices in recent decades has resulted
in the development of diverse information systems for planning, mapping, routing,
and logistics. The exploitation of such systems has significantly increased the cap-
abilities of data processing leading to the appearance of intelligent transportation
systems (ITSs) [10]. Indeed, ITS is a system with the ability to take appropriate
decisions for different states of the transportation network using the data from

vehicles with smart devices. The received data from the sensors and intelligent
devices are monitored by ITSs to extract useful information that can be effectively
used by businesses and governments for taking purposeful decisions. The used
feedback mechanism enables ITSs to continuously improve the performance of
different systems across the transportation network. ITSs consist of a set of subsys-
tems to achieve such improvements that are indicated in Figure 1.1 [11].
As one of the ITSs’ subsystems, intelligent public transportation systems are
for controlling the public transportation network, maintaining the performance
of the transportation structure, and providing up-to-date information regarding
the network operation and trips for the decision-makers and passengers [12]. As
a context-aware solution to effectively control and manage the traffic challenges
of the transportation network, the intelligent traffic control and management
system has been developed that uses real-time data coming from predictive analytics
as well as connected road infrastructure [13]. The intelligent parking management
system relies on satisfying the requirements of the Internet of things (IoT) device
management, vehicle management, and user information management for

managing vehicle parking [14]. The intelligent traffic information system is
responsible for effectively monitoring traffic by using IoT to create interoperabil-
ity among heterogeneous interconnected devices to avoid vehicle traffic conges-
tion [15]. The application of IoT is not just limited to the mentioned ITSs’
subsystems, but its integration with AI also procures appropriate platforms for
safety management and emergency conditions. Given the significant role of
pavement maintenance in megacities, the intelligent pavement management
system pursues the key goal of scheduling road reviews as well as managing com-
plaints [16]. Indeed, such systems can be most efficient in improving manage-
ment capability, driving economic growth, and supporting the sustainability
of the transportation network when accurate data is available from sensors. In
this regard, different applications of ITSs can be classified into four main classes
that are illustrated in Figure 1.2 [17].
All presented applications for ITSs in Figure 1.2 are based on using the collected
data from vehicles aiming to improve the transportation process, facilitate public
transportation services, and increase driver safety. Thus, ITSs not only ease the
decision-making process for government authorities, but they can also manage
and control planning for the transportation network in an appropriate manner,
resulting in efficient road management, better driver experience, and a proper
degree of passenger comfort [9].

1.3
Coupled Structure of ITSs and Multi-Energy
Networks
The described applications of ITSs highlight their undeniable place in the future
energy network infrastructure. The rise in transport demand has substantially
increased for different types of transportation services in recent years. In this respect,
vehicles with traditional fossil fuels were mainly responsible for satisfying the trans-
portdemandinthe transportationnetwork.However,considerable advancements in
the technology of clean energy systems have changed the mentioned trend in the
usageoffossilfuel-baseddevicesinthetransportationsector.Theenvironmentalpro-
blems caused by traditional systems have driven the transportation sector to operate
carbon-freedevicesinbothpersonalvehiclesandpublictransportservices.Moreover,
recent endeavors have been focused on significantly declining the carbon emissions
in the transportation premise and actualizing green transportation more than ever
before. However, rapid developments in energy technologies do not accept such a
reduction degree and define ambitious goals in constructing zero-emission transpor-
tation networks. Therefore, the modernization of the transportation network is
accompanied by realizing 100% RES goals in the grid modernization process. How-
ever, uncertainties in clean energy production by RESs have procured difficult con-
ditionsformakingsuchdecarbonizationplansreliablyimplementableinthepractice.
Indeed, most clean energy production systems rely on climate-dependent systems
whoseoutputsvarysimultaneouslywithclimatechanges.Hence,incorporatingRESs
in the transportation sector donates the challenge of their uncontrollable energy gen-
eration, which is already a great concern for energy networks. In this circumstance,
although ITSs can pave the successful adoption of diverse technologies for providing
an acceptable degree of safety and services in the transportation network, reliable
exploitation of the transportation sector still remains a considerable challenge when
planning to realize zero-emission goals through full usage of RESs. Herein, given the
great achievements of deploying multi-energy systems in boosting the ability of
energy grids in coping with the intermittences of RESs, their utilization in the trans-
portation network can open new doors for this sector to act most flexibly in making
green transportation. Indeed, multi-energy networks offer a set of multi-energy
interactions using different technologies such as power-to-X to enable renewable-
dominant structures for supplying energy. The aforementioned benefits are a key
portion of opportunities that the transportation grid with RESs requires to keep its
sustainability in the green economy. Therefore, the considerable advantages of
multi-energy systems in easing the adoption of a high level of RESs highlight the
necessity of interconnected exploitation of the transportation network with
multi-energy grids. Indeed, coupling them is an essential step for facilitating the
implementation of decarbonization plans as well as realizing green transportation
infrastructure.

Summary
Recent evolutions in technology development along with the rapid growth in
multi-energy demand have affected different sectors across the globe. The trans-
portation network has also not been spared from these transformations and has
witnessed widespread changes in different layers of transportation management.
One of the affected parts is ITSs which are developed in a way to improve synergies
while promoting interoperability between various participants of the transporta-
tion network. In this respect, ITSs cannot satisfy the modernization expectations
of transportation alone. On the other hand, multi-energy systems render attractive
privileges for utilizing RESs and efficiently constructing green transportation.
Thus, there is a great necessity for coupling ITSs and multi-energy networks to
easily reach the grid modernization goals. This chapter highlights this necessity
by mostly focusing on the grid modernization viewpoint. Moreover, it also clarified
the different applications of ITSs in the transportation network.

Introduction
2.1.1
Motivation and Problem Description
The most significant issue facing contemporary society is population growth. The
demand to consume various resources grows even more as the population grows.
For stability and forward movement, the world has to guarantee dependable and
stable access to its basic requirements. At first glance, food, energy, and water are
the three basic needs that are thought to be necessary for a society. The environ-
ment must be destroyed in order to fulfill these systemic needs.
The society and organizations that make policies give these three demands a lot
of consideration. One of society’s fundamental needs is social welfare, although it
receives less attention. One of the main pillars of social welfare is transportation.
Unreasonable population expansion, inadequate planning for the construction of
roads, and an unchecked increase in the number of automobiles have all caused
issues for human society [1].
The development of technology opened up a new area for the planning and rede-
sign of conventional systems [2]. Redesign and special look at the changes in tra-
ditional systems to save energy consumption were applied and implemented in
large networks such as electricity. In the power system, the coordination between
different energy carriers led to significant economic benefits [3]. The transporta-

with energy and greenhouse gas emissions issues, the traditional transportation
system struggles with car congestion due to its inadequate infrastructure. Green
transportation (GT) was proposed as a solution to these issues and as the corner-
stone of the new transportation system, notwithstanding these issues and the fun-
damental requirement to rethink the traditional transportation system [4]. The
following objectives and problems have been addressed in this chapter, which
is centered on the GT system:
• Discussing the development and expansion of the transportation system.
• Population growth and the issues it brings are studied statistically.
• Vehicle traffic as a consequence of the community’s growing population and
people’s time wastage.
• Pollution of the environment and greenhouse gas emissions from the transpor-
tation system.
• Effects and advantages of GT versus traditional transportation systems.
• Issues that prevent the growth of GT.
• Effect of new technologies on GT’s acceleration.
• Intelligent transportation systems and methods for connection between various
components.
2.1.2
Literature Review
One of the biggest problems brought on by the use of traditional transport systems is
global warming. Without changing the current system’s structure, every attempt to
reduce transportation density will have a negative impact on both the general sat-
isfaction of society and the transportation industry [5]. In Ref. [6], it is investigated
how increasing the usage of fossil fuels puts both the global environment and global
society at irreversible harm. It is recommended that the global economy shift toward
carbon reduction so that the rise in global temperature does not exceed 2 . There are
serious challenges in reducing carbon with the goal of lowering temperatures. The
use of renewable energy sources is one of these difficulties. In order to overcome
these obstacles, there must be broad international cooperation. As a result, the
United Nations member states decided to work together in this direction [7].
The Green Climate Fund was formed in 2010 to help finance this objective. The
big businesses then started to reduce their carbon emissions. Businesses are
encouraged to invest in this area, and transportation companies strive to act in
a less carbon-intensive manner, thanks to the assistance of the international com-
munity and the adoption of legislation [8]. The ultimate purpose of the transpor-
tation system is to make it easier for people to go about their normal, everyday lives
without wasting time. Another major objective of better transportation is to move
commodities more efficiently while having less of a negative impact on the
2.1 Introduction

environment [9]. In light of these circumstances, the world community has set sus-
tainability in transportation as a goal. This means finding ways to meet societal
requirements while also protecting the environment and future generations’
access to resources [10]. Several governments have modified their policies to solve
this problem and are working to achieve sustainable transportation [11]. Despite
government attempts to promote sustainable transportation, the use of conven-
tional and fossil fuels and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions have created
an unstable environment [12]. One of the key causes of declining societal health
and environmental destruction is the emission of greenhouse gases [13]. The use of
clean fuels and the electrification of cars rather than the use of fossil fuels in the
transportation sector can work to address these concerns and problems [14, 15].
The use of sustainable transport was recognized, and suggestions were made
specifically for public transportation [16]. There are still some unknowns despite
all the recommendations and alternative solutions to the transportation issues.
Researchers recognized the urgent need to develop a GT system after assessing
the severity of the system’s issues. A system of GT is one in which all modes of
transportation cause the least amount of damage to the environment and to
people’s health [4]. These concepts and topics are also covered in this chapter:
1) Investigated the development of transportation from the invention of the wheel
to modern green and smart transportation.
2) Problems brought on by population growth, such as the escalation of traffic and
the contamination of the environment.
3) Agreements and treaties established in relation to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
4) Challenges that need to be overcome to implement GT.
5) Technology advancements that are practical as well as new are speeding up the
development of greener transportation.
2.1.3
Chapter Organization
The remainder of this chapter first reviews and presents the history of the trans-
portation system from the age of the invention of the wheel to the present, and
then lists the issues and difficulties that the current transportation faces as a result
of population increase. After reviewing the international accords that have been
put forth to address the issues of GT and global warming, the GT system is
described and its difficulties are looked at. Multiple energy networks and GT’s
effects are investigated. The methods for implementing GT are offered after the
definition of the GT system. The newest technology utilized by the GT system
is discussed and presented at the end.

2.2
History of Transportation
Studying the history and current state of transportation systems is crucial for
researching and evaluating various vehicle types. The welfare of society is consid-
erably increased by transportation systems. The movement of people and products
both vertically and horizontally may be referred to as transportation. When it
comes to vertical transportation, equipment is utilized for lifting tasks like remov-
ing objects from atop structures, metal from mines, and other things. The Shadow
apparatus, which was used in Mesopotamia to lift water, is one of the historical
examples of a vertical transportation system [17–20].
The invention of the first wheel in 3500 BC can be regarded as the start of hor-
izontal transportation [21]. Around 2000 BC, small chariots developed in Syria or
northern Mesopotamia and were the first horizontal wheeled means of transpor-
tation, which swiftly swept throughout the Middle East [22]. Although it was pri-
marily utilized for military purposes, this kind of chariot was also used for travel
and hunting. Around 1550 BC, chariot use spread throughout Greece as a result of
trade and migration. Chariot use led to the development of roadways, which were
primarily tied to the building of bridges across rivers and streams [22]. Horses were
utilized to pull chariots throughout this time period, and they were regarded as the
most crucial component of the transportation system [3].
Up until the year 1400 AD, when Europeans invented the horse-drawn wagon,
chariots were still in use [23]. James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in
1769 sparked a massive revolution in both industry and daily life [24].
Boats and steamships were among the first modes of transportation to make
significant strides using Watt steam engines in 1783 [25]. Locomotives were
the first land vehicles to benefit from steam engines. The locomotive was
unveiled in 1801, and its “Salamanca” commercial counterpart was conceived
and constructed in 1812 [25]. A more advanced version of this locomotive with
eight wagons was shown two years later. Thirty tons of coal could be moved by
this locomotive at a speed of 4 miles per hour [25]. The first air transport
method was the hot air balloon, which was invented and developed in
1783 [26].
The invention of the bicycle in the 1790s marked the beginning of the personal
vehicle age [25]. In 1886, the first motorized vehicle was created, and people
started using them [27]. A century or so later, in 1980, a more advanced model
of the automobile without a driver was invented [28]. Parallel to this progress,
motorized airplanes first flew in 1903; electric subways began operating in
1890; cruise ships appeared in 2002; and lastly, from 2010 onward, electric auto-
mobiles have significantly increased horizontal transportation and impacted peo-
ple’s lives [29]. Figure 2.1 depicts the development and growth of transportation
based on the history as described.

Transportation Expansion Issues
There are several issues with the traditional transportation system. These issues
are caused by an increase in the number of vehicles, a lack of infrastructure,
and facilities within the system, as well as factors relating to the local environment
and society. The spread of urbanization and the rise in population are just two pro-
blems that have a negative impact on the traditional transportation system. The
transportation system has also imposed problems on the environment, such as
the rise in traffic and the release of greenhouse gases. Below, these concerns
and issues are discussed in more detail.
2.3.1
Urbanization’s Growth
Around the world, urban areas are more populous than rural ones. In 2018, 55% of
people worldwide lived in urban settings, according to United Nations figures.
Urbanization is expected to increase from 30% of the global population in 1950
to 68% of the global population by 2050 [30]. According to figures from 2018, North
America now has the greatest rate of urbanization, with 82% of the population liv-
ing in cities. Europe has 74%, Oceania has 68%, and Latin America and the Car-
ibbean have 81%. Asia has now reached a 50% urbanization rate [30].
While only 43% of Africans live in cities, the continent remains predominantly
rural. Since 1950, the world’s rural population has slowly increased, and it is antici-
pated that it will soon hit an all-time high before starting to drop. The number of
rural people worldwide is predicted to decline from its present level of about 3.4
billion to about 3.1 billion in 2050. Nearly 90% of the world’s rural population lives
in Africa and Asia. With 893 million people, India has the most people living in
rural areas, followed by China with 578 million. Since 1950, the global urban pop-
ulation has increased significantly, from 751 million to 4.2 billion people in 2018.
This is in contrast to the rate at which the rural population is growing. Asia now
has 54% of the world’s urban population while being less urbanized than other
continents. With 13% apiece, Europe and Africa are next [30].

The economic structure has changed as urbanization has increased. According
to the data provided in Ref. [30], the gross domestic product (GDP) of agriculture
has declined from 27% to 10%, and the GDP of industry has climbed from 32% to
43% as a result of the rise in urbanization demand [31]. The total number of regis-
tered automobiles has climbed from 200 million in 1960 to 1430 million worldwide
in 2018 due to the growing population and the rising desire of the younger gener-
ation for a personal vehicle [32]. Three hundred sixty-three million commercial
cars and 1.06 billion private vehicles make up the 1.42 billion vehicles now in
use globally. Figure 2.2 depicts the rise in both population and vehicles [30].
The three key problems of social, economic, and environmental satisfaction are
intimately tied to urban expansion and the rise in cars. Despite population expan-
sion, well-managed urbanization can still offer a number of advantages if long-term
population patterns are taken into account. Planning and management can simul-
taneously reduce environmental damage and other negative impacts brought on by
an increase in city dwellers [30, 33]. The idea of GT is one approach to doing this.
2.3.2
Traffic Growth
One of the most fundamental necessities of humans and industry in modern life,
with the development of industry and technology, is quick mobility. As a result,
members of society employ a variety of modes of transportation, including cars,
trains, and bicycles. However, due to their practicality and ease, personal automo-
biles continue to be the most popular form of transportation out of all these
options. As a result, given the assumption that the population will continue to rise,
more private and public cars will be present in major cities. The issue is that as the

number of cars increases, there has not been a matching growth in the creation
and extension of the transportation infrastructure. Traffic congestion will conse-
quently become a serious problem.
It is true that more traffic and congestion may result from industrial expansion
or other factors, and while they may help many people economically, they will also
cause more issues for society as a whole. Public transportation will suffer from
overcrowding, and the depreciation of public vehicles will grow. The society is
shifting toward the usage of personal automobiles, which is increasing traffic in
metropolitan areas. Increasing the number of personal vehicles on the road would
undoubtedly increase the dangers for motorcyclists, cyclists, and pedestrians.
Additionally, people without access to a car will have a harder time taking advan-
tage of urban living’s advantages and will have a lesser quality of life, a situation
that will only get worse as the population ages. There are additional disadvantages
to traffic in every society. One of these disadvantages is that every member of soci-
ety wastes time, which is one of the barriers to the progress of society.

hours vary depending on each city’s population and geography. Figure 2.4 depicts
the percentage growth in traffic from 2020 in several places throughout the
world [34].
2.3.3
Environmental Issues
The transportation services industry played a bigger role in people’s daily lives as a
result of population growth. Additionally, the transportation industry serves as an
essential and undeniable infrastructure for the growth of any society’s economy
and industry, transporting millions of tons of cargo and a large number of passen-
gers every day. It was anticipated that advancements in technology and the growth
of the virtual world would lessen the need for physical transmission; however,
despite the virtual world’s expansion, the emergence of new opportunities, and
society’s encouragement to make more transfers, not only was the global depend-
ence on this industry not reduced, but it also experienced rapid growth. Despite the
necessity of transportation for the global community, the use of fossil fuels in the
system has made it a threat to the environment and the health of society. Emis-
sions of CO2, CO, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen, and sulfur oxides, as well

as fine particles, are primarily to blame for this threat (heavy metals, micro- and
nanoplastics, etc.) [35].
Table 2.1 lists the emissions of CO2, SOx, suspended particles PM10, and PM2.5 in
various cities around the world [1]. There are many causes of PM10 and PM2.5 emis-
sions, including improper fuel combustion and tire and brake wear. In addition to
the importance of transportation for the world community, the transportation sec-
tor and its related services have grown to be one of the biggest consumers of petro-
leum products globally, contributing significantly to the production of airborne
pollutants. Approximately, 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions are attributed
to the transportation system. 23% of CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil
fuels globally are related to the transportation sector. From 1970 to 2007, transpor-
tation-related CO2 emissions rose by 45%; by 2030, they are predicted to rise by
about 40% [36].
For example, Figure 2.5 depicts the amount of CO2 gas produced in the United
States in 2020, which is equal to 5981 million tons, and 27% of the total CO2 pro-
duction is accounted for by the transportation system [37].
Despite all the advancements in air, sea, and rail transportation, road transpor-
tation is much more popular due to its lower cost, high flexibility, and quick
response time. Road transportation accounts for 30–40% of all transportation-
related CO2 emissions, so finding and implementing a solution to this issue in soci-
ety is only natural. The “greening” of road transportation has been suggested as a
solution to this issue [37].

Definition of Green Transportation
In order to address the transportation-related difficulties, the UN established a
high-level advisory group in 2016 to offer guidance and address these problems.
At the first World Summit on Sustainable Transport in 2016, this group’s initial
report was released [30]. Only 50% of metropolitan areas have trouble-free access
to urban transportation, according to a report released by the UN in 2020 [38].
Informal transportation networks, which frequently lack safety measures, have
grown in the remaining 50% of regions.
The worldwide community’s travel habits have significantly changed as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which has led to an increase in the usage of per-
sonal transportation. Despite these modifications to the transportation system and
the effect these services have on societal problems related to the economy, society,
and the environment (Figure 2.6), technological and economic advancement should

be taken into account to enhance this significant and influential system in people’s
lives. Due to these factors, scientists and researchers recognized the urgency of the
situation and made an effort to define and present a GT system.
The idea of “transportation services that have a less detrimental impact than the
current transportation system on the health of individuals in society and the sur-
rounding environment” can be used to describe GT. As a vast field of technology,
GT encompasses things like the effective use of electric vehicle technology, the
more effective use of fossil and conventional fuels, and the use of novel fuels like
hydrogen and biogas for private and public transportation [1].
2.5
Advantages of Green Transportation
The primary objective of GT is to plan transportation-related activities so that there
is the least amount of money spent and the least amount of environmental harm.
Before the idea of GT and the disregard for the environment, objectives were solely
determined by economic factors. Environmental factors are taken into account
alongside economic costs due to growing environmental concerns. Different ben-
efits are produced in comparison to the conventional transportation system by
implementing the GT concept [1, 39].
One of GT’s most significant advantages is its ability to reduce the number of
cars in urban regions. The danger of traffic accidents and collisions between cars
can be reduced by fewer cars on the road and the use of new technologies. The
sustainability of current energy sources is improved by using new energies as well
as by planning and optimizing the transportation network. Reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, including CO2, is one of GT’s main objectives. GT drastically
decreases the use of automobiles while increasing the use of new technologies,
renewable energy sources, and other forms of transportation. These acts contribute
to reducing greenhouse gas emissions [39, 40].
Traffic is decreased as a consequence of the transit system being optimized as a
result of GT, which decreases community members’ wasted time and raises their
satisfaction. People in the community and all sectors engaged in the transportation
system can reduce costs by reducing traffic, enhancing vehicle fuel efficiency, opti-
mizing transportation, and utilizing technology [39]. Figure 2.7 displays some of
the advantages and results of GT.
2.6
International Agreements
The global community decided to take action and work toward removing these
gases from the environment due to the environmental issues caused by the emis-
sion of greenhouse gases. This decision was made with an eye toward the future
18
2 Green Transportation Systems

and taking into account the growth of these emissions. The European Union made
a decision and published the European Commission’s vision in a document known
as a “White Paper” in 2011, focusing on the coordination of transportation policies
as one of the most significant factors in the production of greenhouse gases [1].
In this document, it is stated that as transportation increased and fossil fuels
were used more frequently, oil became more scarce. As a result, the price of oil
would increase, which would have an impact on the economy and lower social
satisfaction. Additionally, it was decided to keep temperature variations under
2 because of the environment and because it was stated in this document. It is
necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–90% from 1990 levels until
2050 in order to meet this objective [1].
In these situations, oil fuel still accounts for 96% of EU transportation. In accord-
ance with this document, the use of conventionally fueled vehicles will decrease by
half by 2030 and end entirely in the major urban areas by 2050. Additionally, the

2.7
Challenges to GT
Due to its close ties to the personal and social lives of society’s members and the
institutionalization of this need in their lives since ancient times, the transporta-
tion system encounters significant resistance to changes. Society refuses change
for two primary reasons. The first is the society’s habit to an extremely antiquated
and institutionalized system in the specifics of their lives, and the second is the
economic issues and laws. These two factors together account for the majority
of the resistance from the people of the society. It is expensive to switch from
one system to another at first, and doing so necessitates amending the relevant
laws and regulations, which will meet resistance from the general populace.

2 Green Transportation Systems

In general, when taking into account the challenges, all the stakeholders in the
transportation system should be taken into account.
The companies that provide the infrastructure for the transportation system,
environmental and environmental organizations, transportation companies, busi-
nesses, research organizations, and most importantly, society’s citizens, are all
examples of stakeholders. These stakeholders’ actions and responses to the adjust-
ments and difficulties they encounter vary from one another. The challenges and
obstacles are broken down into five categories and each category is expressed sep-
arately in order to determine the best course of action for GT while also satisfying
and controlling all stakeholders (Figure 2.9).
2.7.1
Institutional Challenges
Politicians and legislators have always faced a fundamental problem when their
views diverged on a particular issue. This issue is a fundamental one for man-
agers of smaller organizations as well as for politicians in order to achieve the
same objectives within the organization. Due to its size and the presence of
numerous stakeholders, the transportation system is struggling with the issue of leg-
islation. The existence of geographic and political borders, as well as various legis-
lative bodies in various nations, is the cause of this issue. For these reasons, creating
coordination to bear the costs of creating a GT system can become a big challenge.
The societal adoption of new technologies and fuels is another significant issue
that needs to be addressed through legislation. Society must understand how new
technology affects the economy and personal comfort in order to be motivated to
use it. The information on these technologies’ effects on the economy and social

life is scarce because of how recent they are. Customers and society are therefore
not persuaded to purchase a vehicle based on the use of novel and environmentally
friendly fuels.
2.7.2
Regulatory Challenges and Barriers
Numerous changes in the social and economic structure of the country have been
brought about by population growth and urbanization. The expansion of the trans-
portation system and its significant impact on people’s lives are the results of these
changes. The planning of governments and the management of countries is based
on the idea that the development of each populated area should be balanced; how-
ever, as the population grows and moves to urban areas, there are more jobs avail-
able in the service sector. Urban areas become more densely populated as a result.
This results in various issues, lowers social welfare, and obstructs city managers’
ability to make sound policies. There is still competition among the conventional
vehicles using traditional fuels in the transportation sector, despite the introduc-
tion of new vehicles using cleaner fuel and also as a result of investors’ reluctance
to invest in the new generation of vehicles. Applying a higher tax cannot be a good
way to encourage society to use these fuel-efficient vehicles because it deviates
from the intended goal and harms domestic transportation competition [42].
With the implementation of current policies, there is also the concern of a loss of
national competitiveness because of the possibility for public unrest brought on by
the capacity overload of the transportation and urban infrastructure due to pop-
ulation and vehicle growth. Despite these problems, policymakers must find a
way to interact and communicate with the public because policies cannot be
implemented without the support of society and because achieving the goals of
GT requires widespread acceptance by society and the public.
2.7.3
Technology-related Barriers
The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the essential pillars of the exe-
cution of the idea of GT. The employment of technology is one of the most practical
and efficient methods out of all the tools available for this aim. Technology can be
used to manage automobiles completely and comprehensively while simultane-
ously lowering the degree of greenhouse gas emissions [43].
Even with all the positive aspects and advantages of the new system’s use of tech-
nology, there are drawbacks. The majority of these issues originate from how chal-
lenging it is to integrate and adapt the conventional system to new technologies.
A major problem is adapting to and having access to technology in many countries
and communities. Because less developed countries have less access to technology
than wealthy nations do, it will take time and significant advancement to bring the
idea of GT to the level that is desired.
22
2 Green Transportation Systems

If traditional fuels are used, the concept of GT will encounter several issues due
to the growth in people and the ensuing increase in automobiles. Under these cir-
cumstances, the use of fuels should shift toward high-quality fuels, and efforts
should be made to improve the fuel’s quality and environmental compatibility
by implementing new technology. However, it is not an easy process to replace
new fuels and automobiles that are compatible with these fuels. The large number
of traditional cars using fossil fuels is one of the issues that lie ahead. The devel-
opment of associated fuel station technology, as well as vehicle maintenance tech-
nology, is necessary to replace modern technology with sustainable fuel as a
replacement for many traditional automobiles. The general satisfaction of society
is yet another problem with technological advancement. The development of tech-
nology must be followed by the observation of its effects on people’s lives through-
out time in order for it to result in their satisfaction.
In light of this, one of the challenges facing emerging eco-friendly transportation
technology is public satisfaction. To show how technology improves people’s lives
and to hasten the adoption of new technologies, policymakers should offer
solutions.
2.7.4
Financial Barriers
Depending on the country, different infrastructure is required to promote GT.
As a result, each country should use a distinct approach when building the infra-
structure required for GT. In developed countries, the necessary infrastructure is
in good condition and does not require significant investment to get them ready
for the introduction of GT. Numerous infrastructures in less developed countries
are in poor shape, and it costs a lot of money to expand and improve them.
Following are some of the infrastructures that need to be modified and ready
for use with GT:
• Road
• Transport companies
• Vehicle control technology
• Green fuel station
• Data communication centers between vehicles
• GT-based management and planning agencies for urban transportation
GT has a variety of objectives, some of which are global in scope, and it will
succeed in achieving those objectives if the international community supports it.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the environment are two of
these objectives. These objectives necessitate a global strategy for infrastructure pro-
vision and development in less-developed nations. Large investment firms should
be encouraged to invest in these nations by these policies [43].
2.7 Challenges to GT
23

2.7.5
General Admission
When purchasing and using vehicles, the majority of society’s members
consider factors like fuel costs, vehicle dependability, car prices, and vehicle
safety. Less attention is paid to environmental issues like greenhouse gas
emissions. The traditional mindset of people is also not very conducive when
it comes to public transportation, which has a special place in the concept
of GT.
According to the ingrained social stereotype, public transportation is primarily
used by schoolchildren, the elderly, persons of low socioeconomic status, etc., and
is therefore less trustworthy and independent than a personal vehicle [42]. For
these reasons, simply replacing the existing system with a new one without any
policy or planning is not recommended. Instead, the public should be won over
by enhancing the public transportation system’s level of quality, dependability,
and organization. Additionally, because they worry about society’s acceptance,
investors and transport businesses in the investment sector are less interested
in reducing carbon emissions. By creating regulations and favorable conditions,
policymakers should encourage these enterprises to transform and invest [44]

Green Transportation’s Effects on Multi-Energy
Networks
According to forecasts, the expansion of multi-carrier and hybrid networks will
result in a favorable and profitable increase in natural gas consumption in the
coming years. Multi-carrier networks have started to grow significantly in recent
years [45]. In contrast to independent energy systems, multi-carrier systems
exhibit integrated and interacting behaviors among various energy carriers. As
an illustration, CHPs, which burn natural gas to generate both heat and electricity,
increase the reliance on both thermal and electric energy [46]. In multi-carrier sys-
tems, several energy carrier quantities are combined with each other in order to
supply various customers while pursuing various optimization goals. In compar-
ison to single-carrier and independent systems, one of the most significant benefits
of multi-carrier systems is the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions [45].
The GT system and its components are regarded as one of the largest consumers
of multi-carrier networks due to the expansion of the consumption of various
energy carriers by new vehicles, such as electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, etc.
The transport system’s continuity and interconnection to multi-carrier networks
can be looked at from two distinct viewpoints. The dependency between multi-
carrier energy network optimization and transport network optimization is the
first viewpoint. The performance and optimization of multi-carrier energy net-
works can be improved by the coordination and optimization of various GT system
components, which use energy supplied by the multi-carrier energy network [47].
The second viewpoint focuses on the transfer of energy between various transpor-
tation system components and multiple energy networks. Several storage mechan-
isms are used in modern vehicles. Modern vehicles use a variety of storage systems
such as batteries and hydrogen storage devices. These vehicles can be employed as
resources to optimize multi-carrier networks when necessary, which will lead to
their stability and enhancement [48]. A multi-energy network and its connection
to vehicles using various fuels are depicted in Figure 2.11 as an example.
2.9
Implementation Strategies for the Green
Transportation System
The need for more infrastructure, such as roads and automobiles, as a result of
population growth is one of the most significant issues with traditional transpor-
tation. This point of view has its own economic and social issues, and each of the
2.9 Implementation Strategies for the Green Transportation System
25

old infrastructures can only be expanded to a certain point in terms of size. Due to
environmental issues, this old perspective and system cannot be expanded upon or
maintained.
In 2004 (GIZ), a novel strategy concentrating on the demand side of transpor-
tation for large works was outlined and suggested as a means of overcoming
the traditional transportation system. The following three fundamental ideas form
the basis of this strategy [49]:
• Avoid or reduce
• Change
• Improvement
The first tenet of this strategy, known as “Avoid” asserts that, to the greatest
extent possible, urban planning should be done such that the efficacy of transpor-
tation is maximized, mobility is decreased, and the basic requirements of the com-
munity are met regionally.
“Change” focuses on enhancing transportation by attempting to increase the
community’s use of nonmotorized modes of transportation like walking and bicy-
cling. Public transportation should thus take precedence in society, followed by the
usage of personal vehicles only under rare conditions.
Fuel economy and the optimization of transportation system components are
the main topics of the third “Improvement” principle. By emphasizing the need
to utilize fewer fossil fuels, this principle also paves the way for the creation of
clean fuels like electricity and hydrogen. This stage also includes attempting to

build the infrastructure for these fuels, including their stations and the vehicles
that consume them.
City management can use and put into practice these concepts on the transpor-
tation system in one of two ways: through an attraction policy or a fine. Different
transportation sectors execute these policies in different ways. For instance, in the
public sector, the more regular, reliable, and comfortable they are, the more likely
it is that people will choose them as their preferred mode of transportation. This
will then make control and monitoring easier for city managers [31].
The presented approach is executed and applied differently in various countries.
The amount of CO2 gas is what causes the variation in implementation. The objec-
tive is to minimize gases, especially CO2, in underdeveloped countries where the
standard of vehicles is low and the level of greenhouse gas emissions is high. The
objective shifts to lowering the concentration and eventually removing CO2 in
developed countries where infrastructure and vehicles have attained a good stand-
ard level [50] (Figure 2.12).

2.9 Implementation Strategies for the Green Transportation System
27

2.9.1
Actions Performed to Promote Green Transportation
The National Environmental Policy Act, passed in 1970, is one of the steps made to
enhance the environmental behavior of transportation [51]. The Clean Air Law
was then approved and put into effect. The law requiring vehicle adaptation to
greenhouse gas emission laws was developed at the same time and put into effect
in 1990. Every vehicle must abide by the specifications of these laws so that its
greenhouse gas emissions do not go above a predetermined threshold. These reg-
ulations stipulate that cars must possess a pollutant level certificate, which must be
updated and renewed every three months. This has two extremely practical ben-
efits: The first is that the overall level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions is
managed. The second benefit is that it raises public awareness of environmental
contamination and the significance of environmental issues in society.
2.10
New Technologies for Green Transportation
As the idea of GT has grown and environmental laws and treaties have been
adopted to reduce the impact of pollution on the environment, the rise in green-
house gas emissions has been accompanied by penalties and legal pressure. These
fines decrease revenue and impede the operations of transportation businesses. In
this regard, in order to sustain both their revenue and client pleasure, transporta-
tion businesses are compelled to alter how they utilize current facilities. The tech-
nology significantly lowers greenhouse gas emissions, providing transportation
businesses with a way to comply with and uphold environmental laws and regula-
tions. Additionally, companies’ productivity and profits have increased, and client
satisfaction levels have risen as well [13].
2.10.1
Energy Technology
In society, it is typical to drive conventional cars with internal combustion
engines. Internal combustion engines propel the vehicle by converting the chem-
ical energy found in fossil fuels into mechanical energy through combustion.
After internal combustion engines, transportation technology moved toward
the use of batteries and fuel cells. However, using batteries is not always prefer-
able to using internal combustion engines. When using batteries, characteristics
like storage capacity, lifespan, usability, safety, and cost-effectiveness should be
taken into account. Lithium-ion batteries are one type of battery that can support
these features [52].
One of the effective ways to increase energy use is to use hybrid technologies.
Reducing the losses brought on by combustion engines’ internal friction is another
28
2 Green Transportation Systems

way to improve. Around 15% of losses are brought on by friction, which can be
greatly reduced by using new lubricants. These lubricants are the focus of ongoing
laboratory and research work because they significantly improve energy effi-
ciency. Greenhouse gas emissions are decreased by lowering losses and raising
energy efficiency.
Another advancement and step toward environmentally friendly transportation
is fuel technology. The role of fuel in internal combustion engines is crucial. The
use of hybrid fuel technology can significantly increase vehicle efficiency. Gaseous
fuels like hydrogen and natural gas, alcohol-based fuels like methanol and etha-
nol, as well as vegetable fuels and waste, alternative fuels that are environmentally
friendly, are among the fuels that can be used as alternative or hybrid fuels in vehi-
cles. By lowering greenhouse gas emissions, these fuels can be a very good replace-
ment for traditional fossil fuels without affecting the performance of combustion
engines and newer models of cars [1] (Figure 2.13).

29

2.10.2
Environmentally Friendly Technologies
In addition to the fuel issue, other features of cars that fit the concept of GT also
contribute to lowering the emissions. Among these features are the use of environ-
mentally friendly raw materials and their safe recycling, the reduction of the vehi-
cle’s weight to lower energy consumption, and the advancement of the vehicle’s
batteries to maximize its performance. In addition to improving green recycling,
using environmentally friendly materials in the manufacture of cars lowers green-
house gas emissions in auto factories.
Following the use of sustainable fuels to reduce emissions, the consumption of
these fuels should be decreased in order to make them more economically viable
and encourage society to adopt these technologies. The weight of the car affects the
amount of fuel used. According to a general rule, you can reduce fuel consumption
by 7% by losing 10% of the weight of the car [53].
2.10.2.1
Greener Tires
In the discussion of GT, tires need special consideration because they are one of the
most crucial car parts and are closely related to environmental issues. The GT’s
tires have two distinct functions. First, they ought to have a feature that makes
cars more dependable and increases passenger safety. Second, because of wear
on the road and factory conditions, tires must be produced in a way that maximizes
environmental compatibility. Vulcanization is a process used to make rubber tires
durable and useful. Rubber is vulcanized while being exposed to sulfur. This
approach can be abandoned to lessen carbon emissions.
Growing live moss inside tires is one of the suggested solutions for the future of
tires. These mosses will work by soaking up carbon dioxide from vehicles and
water from the roads. Additionally, these mosses will help to maintain tire pres-
sure. The expression of this solution promises to persuade researchers and busi-
nesses to change tires in order to improve the environment, though it should be
noted that this is just a proposed solution and is very far from being a finished
product [54].
2.10.2.2
Reusing Energy
Beyond cutting down on fuel use and switching to sustainable fuels, the GT sys-
tem takes a holistic approach to energy. One of the key components of GT is the
reuse of consumed energy, which stores a portion of the kinetic energy produced
by fuel consumption for use during the next acceleration of the vehicle. Various
storage devices, including batteries and flywheels, are used to perform this
recovery.
30
2 Green Transportation Systems

2.11
Intelligent Transportation System
The expression of the GT concept is heavily reliant on both environmental factors
and technical advancement. The traditional transportation system has changed
significantly in recent years as a result of technological advancements such as
the development of self-driving and intelligent vehicles and new sensors. It
became possible to apply smart programs with the development of technology
and its penetration into transportation systems, as well as other new systems like
robotic systems. The following are examples of elements of the transportation sys-
tem that will develop and become more intelligent as technology advances:
• Road management and vehicle volume control
• Car information management
• Passenger information
• Traffic management
• Management of emergency vehicles
The integration of information across the many transportation sectors could
offer a number of advantages. Its first and most significant benefit is a reduction
in the pollution produced by vehicle movement. One of the most significant objec-
tives of GT is pollution reduction, which may be accomplished by making it more
intelligent. Other benefits of positive changes include a decrease in the number of
cars and traffic, a decrease in accidents, and an increase in the dependability and
safety of inhabitants [55].
Numerous concepts and improvements were developed in them as a result of the
smart platform’s integration into the transportation system and the growth of elec-
tric vehicles. The following can be included as some of the ITS-related fields and
developments:
• Creating smart roads: The primary motivation for expressing and putting this
notion into practice is to be aware of the number of vehicles on the road. It
can be quite helpful to use this data for central planning and optimization, as
well as to advise drivers about the status of the route and help them choose
a route.
• Satellite traffic control: With this technology, information can be exchanged
between ground stations and satellites to intelligently monitor and regulate traf-
fic on the roads.
• Self-driving vehicles: With the development of electric vehicles, as well as
advancements in software and robotics, self-driving vehicles can play a signifi-
cant part in environmentally friendly transportation. If there is road infrastruc-
ture, these vehicles can use the internal computer to make the safest and most
cost-effective choice.
2.11 Intelligent Transportation System
31

• Vehicles with biometric technology: Compared to conventional security mea-
sures, using biometric technologies to lock and secure the vehicle is far more
effective. You can utilize fingerprints or eye scans with this technology.
• Remote tracking: Using location-based technologies, the location of the vehicle
can be traced. Insurance and social service expenses can also be intelligently cal-
culated based on the distance traveled.
• Monitoring the driver’s and passengers’ health actively: The expansion of in-car
sensors and the presence of a communication network connecting the vehicle to
management centers allow for real-time monitoring of passenger health and the
intelligent dispatch of emergency assistance in the event of an emergency.
2.11.1
Vehicle Communication in Intelligent Transportation
Communication between components is a key topic when it comes to intelligent
transportation. The Internet of Things is one of the platforms suggested and
offered for communication in the transportation industry. New channels of com-
munication with the outside world and with other cars are made available via the
Internet of Things. This communication has improved the efficiency of automo-
biles and environmentally friendly transportation. Here are three examples of
intelligent transportation vehicle communication [2] (Figure 2.14).
V2I
V2P
V2V
Figure 2.14
Examples of communication in GT.
32
2 Green Transportation Systems

• Vehicles communicating with infrastructure (V2I): This kind of communication
serves as a coordinator. Transportation management carries out its duties for
traffic control and environmental monitoring in this type of communication
by gathering information about the surroundings as well as overall system infor-
mation. In these communications, information about location, traffic alerts,
accident warnings, and safety warnings is sent.
• Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication: Every vehicle, including cars, motor-
bikes, and new vehicles, can communicate with one another and exchange
information through this link. This promotes the safety of transportation by
transferring the sensor data from the vehicles to one another and determining
details like the distance between them and their blind spots.
• Pedestrian-to-vehicle (V2P) communication: In this regard, electronic and smart
gadgets that are linked to communication platforms are used by pedestrians to
interact with moving vehicles. The benefit of this method of communication is
that the pedestrian can update himself on the circumstances and facts surround-
ing him and make the best choice for his course of action and individual strategy.
For instance, he can decide on the best course of action while selecting the mode
of transportation, such as public or private, or his own route.
2.12
Conclusion
The necessity for the current transportation system to transform into a sustainable
system is brought on by the world’s population’s continued development as well as
the rise in urban population density. The idea of GT was developed in response to
this demand and is one of the suggestions for the sustainability of this industry. In
order to further explore this concept, the chapter discussed the evolution of the
transportation system from the discovery of the wheel in 3500 BC to the develop-
ment of the automobile and personal electronic devices. After describing the his-
tory of the transportation system, problems that have arisen owing to the
conventional nature of the current system were discussed. Issues like traffic levels
and the number of hours that each person wastes in traffic in some places across
the world were statistically studied. One of the issues is the transportation system’s
emission of greenhouse gases, which was statistically investigated. After stating
the existing problems, the concept of GT was defined and established as an idea
and solution to overcome the problems, and the advantages of this system and
the green concept were stated and examined. The advantages of this system
and the green concept were discussed after stating the current issues and defining
and establishing the concept of GT as an idea and a means of resolving them.
2.12 Conclusion
33

In order to express the idea of GT and address environmental threats, the inter-
national community’s cooperation is necessary. The treaties that were approved
and put into effect to lessen environmental threats were repeatedly mentioned
after introducing the concept of GT. The Paris Agreement and the European Com-
mission’s White Paper were two of the agreements that were stated and investi-
gated. The complexity of the system and its significant impact on society’s day-
to-day activities make the implementation of GT challenging. The following sub-
ject in this section’s continuation deals with the difficulties and challenges asso-
ciated with implementing GT. We can list organizational problems, financial
problems, regulatory problems, the difficulty of societal acceptance, and technol-
ogy-related improvements as some of the issues that were looked at and discussed.
It was discussed and explained after stating the issues with the A-S-I solution that
is suggested for the step-by-step implementation of this concept. The next issue
that was looked at was the steps that have been taken so far to establish GT around
the world. One of the key pillars in the development of the idea of transportation is
the availability of technology. Fuel and energy technology, which was investigated
and covered in the remainder of this part, is one of the crucial technologies that must
be employed to realize the objectives of GT and make progress every day. The infra-
structures needed to achieve intelligent transportation were among the topics cov-
ered in the intelligentization segment. Intelligent transportation heavily relies on the
ability of the system’s various components to communicate with one another in
order to accomplish its desired goals. Three different V2V, V2I, and V2P communi-
cation types were studied and addressed at the conclusion of this chapter. The sub-
jects discussed make it clear that the current transportation system needs to be
changed in order to be environmentally friendly and prevent damage to the environ-
ment, and that GT is one of the best solutions. The main topics and reviewed results
addressed in this chapter are summarized in the following list:
• History of transportation: Due to investigations, transportation began with the
development of the wheel in 3500 BC, advanced with the development of steam
engines, and today, with the introduction of electric cars, has transitioned
into GT.
• Issues of transportation expansion: By 2018, there were 4.2 billion people living
in urban areas, which led to an increase in traffic and the number of vehicles
there. As a result, these vehicles generate greenhouse gases.
• GT advantages: It was discovered that the concept of GT has several advantages,
like lowering greenhouse gas emissions, reducing traffic, increasing secu-
rity, etc.
• International agreements: As global warming and environmental pollution
increased, the world community came up with regulations and agreements to
address the issue. One of these was the European Union’s white paper.
34
2 Green Transportation Systems

• GT implementation challenges: There are a number of challenges and impedi-
ments that must be overcome, including technological, financial, institutional,
and regulatory issues.
• A-S-I is one of the methods for achieving the concept of GT, which entails three
components: avoidance, change, and improvement. It has been thoroughly
examined and explained.
• New technologies: A review and discussion of new technologies, such as clean
fuels, and new vehicle ideas, such as green tires, was conducted.
• Intelligent transportation system: The examination of intelligent transportation
and the areas in which it is being used, as well as various communication tech-
niques in intelligent transportation, were examined and debated.

Introduction
Transportation system sustainability is one of the pressing concerns for modern
urbanization in major cities across the world. Recent statistics published by the
International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers demonstrate that
nearly 1.06 billion personal/public vehicles and 363 million commercial vehicles
are currently in use worldwide [1]. More than 90% of these vehicles entirely rely on
fuels for the transmission system. Such huge fuel utilization actually contributes to
around 60% of the total global fuel consumption [2] and labels vehicles as preem-
inent contributors to air pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and sulfur
oxides, volatile organic compounds (e.g., cyanide dioxide formaldehyde, and ben-
zene), and other fine particulate matters (e.g., carbon black, micro- and nanoplas-
tics, and heavy metals) [3]. For instance, in 2016, close to 8 gigatons of carbon
dioxide were emitted by the vehicles globally, and the figure was around 71%
higher than that of 1991. In fact, a further increase is likely to be observed in
the upcoming years as the number of vehicles is expected to grow [4].
Given this context, governing bodies aim to plan for more energy- and climate-
efficient transportation [5]. This has led to the introduction of green transporta-
tion systems aspiring to provide modern technology-facilitated vehicle services
with fewer detrimental impacts on the immediate environment and human
health and higher energy ratings contrasting with existing means of transport
[6]. The general objectives of the policies undertaken to familiarize green trans-
portation are to reduce air pollution and fuel dependency by at least 60% and

80%, respectively, by 2050 and to introduce green freight corridors efficiently
limiting congestion [7]. Green transportation systems can contribute toward
optimized traffic flow and traveling speed, enhanced security and safety, and
offer extensive benefits to our economic budgets, environment, and health [8].
Some noteworthy beneficial aspects are captured in Figure 3.1 and demonstrated
as follows [2]:
• Cutting down fuel costs: Embracing green transportation systems can save us a
significant amount of costs related to fuel purchases at fuel stations.
• Building a sustainable economy: Manufacturing green transportation systems can
create a substantial number of jobs in the transportation sector. Thus, socioeco-
nomic disparities can be minimized, and a sustainable economy can be built.
• Decreasing pressure on parking spaces: Using green transportation systems with
multiple occupant features can facilitate overpopulated workplaces and cor-
porations to getting relief from parking problems.
• Decreasing traffic congestion: Adopting green transportation systems with mul-
tiple occupant features can also assist in reducing traffic congestion.
• Less environmental pollution: Shifting to green transportation systems can help
us lower or completely get rid of toxic gas emissions into our atmosphere, result-
ing in fewer to no environmental pollutants.
• Improving human health status: Adapting green transportation systems can also
facilitate us to avoiding cancer, bronchitis, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases caused by toxic gas emissions and
improve our health status.

3 Techno-Economic-Environmental Assessment of Green Transportation Systems

Figure 3.2 depicts examples of some popular modes of green transportation
systems, such as walking to destinations, bicycles, and electric vehicles (EVs) [2].
Walking (could be jogging or running) to work, institutions, shopping, and so on
is not only free from any greenhouse gas emissions but also a good form of body
exercise. Bicycling is also a sort of workout (along with being free from any green-
house gas emissions) but faster than walking. On top of that, the purchasing and
maintenance costs of bicycles are much lower than those of other vehicles. EVs
are primarily powered by multi-carrier energy technologies, such as solar, geother-
mal, hydroelectric, battery, and so forth. Hence, less or no toxic emissions are caused
by these vehicles. At present, three types of EVs are commonly used worldwide
including private, service, and public EVs. Hybrid cars and electric bikes (motor-
cycles and scooters) are notable examples of private EVs. Examples of some service
and freight EVs include hybrid ambulances, trucks, and lorries. On the other hand,
some prominent examples of public EVs are hybrid trains, buses, and boats. Hydro-
gen fuel cell-driven vehicles are another type of green transport, which run on
hydrogen and emit only water vapors, but their wide adoption has not been as pop-
ular as EVs due to significant production costs [9].
However, a number of barriers are also associated with the adoption of green
transportation systems, such as regulatory barriers in terms of policy-making,
institutional barriers (e.g., political issues to materialize undertaken policies, out-
dated infrastructure – road and freight networks, and taxation related to vehicle
purchase and registration), and public support to prioritize environmental sustain-
ability [10]. As such, it is important to articulate how available technologies can be
employed effectively to attain the inherent benefits of green transportation sys-
tems. To this end, this chapter focuses on an overview of the techno-economic-
environmental approaches and benefits of green transportation systems to help

the readers understand their applicability in today’s world. To do so, the following
contributions are made:
• An overview of modern technologies, that can be utilized for green transporta-
tion systems, is demonstrated.
• Further, both the financial viability and environmental-friendly operation of
green transportation systems are assessed based on some real-world data.

Technologies for Green Transportation Systems
Several modern technologies are currently available to develop and operate green
transportation systems. They include eco-friendly, energy-efficient, energy reus-
ing, intelligent system, integrated management, and distributed ledger technolo-
gies. The benefits, statistical facts, and current applicability of these technologies
are outlined in this section. Also, a succinct overview is summarized in Table 3.1.

3.2.1
Eco-Friendly and Energy-Efficient Technologies
An eco-friendly technology can optimize vehicle performance by utilizing eco-
friendly materials for production and less rolling resistance, scaling down vehicle
weight, and advancing driving attributes, for instance, transmission, braking,
acceleration, and cornering [11]. The use of eco-friendly materials in vehicle con-
struction products can result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the reduc-
tion in a vehicle’s weight can diminish fuel consumption. It is reported in Ref. [8]
that approximately 5–7% of fuel usage can be decreased by a 10% minimization in
vehicle weight. The BMW i3 – with an underfloor battery pack and an optional
range-extending fuel engine to power the car – is a glaring example in which rein-
forced carbon fiber is applied in vehicle construction instead of steel to lower the
vehicle weight by 30–50% contrasting with steel. The weight of the battery pack is
also counterbalanced by the light body of the BMW i3 [12].
A solar impulse technology is a type of eco-friendly technology, in which solar
energy is converted into electrical energy by photovoltaic (PV) cells to drive vehi-
cles. This technology (designated as solar impulse-2’s lightweight construction)
left its mark on the world in 2015 by building the first-ever solar-driven round-
the-world flight [13]. Besides, the first-ever self-charging solar-powered cargo bike,
with a 545 W peak capacity, was launched in 2021. The cargo bike gathers about
50% of its power on average from solar energy, but it goes up to 100% during sunny
days enabling the cargo bike to operate as an EV [14].
An energy-efficient technology-based green transportation system is predom-
inantly driven by batteries (with optimized scheduling, longevity, safety, and
cost), hydrogen gas, and hybrid combustion systems. According to an analytical
analysis published in Ref. [15], lithium-ion batteries are found to be more sup-
portive in providing optimized operation efficiently as they can be charged and
discharged with 15% more efficiency compared to traditional lead acid batteries.
Thus, vehicles with lithium-ion batteries can be operated with greater energy
efficiency. On the other hand, hydrogen gas can generate energy around 30%
more efficiently in comparison with conventional combustion-governed power
plants and can lead to the development of energy-efficient vehicles [33]. Vehicles
with hybrid combustion systems use biodiesel instead of existing diesel to cut
back on toxic gas emissions without compromising the combustion engine per-
formance of the vehicles [16].
An energy reusing technology focuses on more air usage in place of fuel in
green transportation systems. It also incorporates kinetic energy recovery tech-
nology to recover and reuse the induced energy – originated from the break of an
EV. The induced energy can be stored in batteries and flywheels for later utili-
zation under acceleration. This technical approach has already been used in both
racing and passenger cars [8]. An energy control system is also presented in Ref.
[17] to manage the acceleration and deceleration of vehicles by adopting this
technology.
3.2 Technologies for Green Transportation Systems
43

3.2.2
Intelligent System Technologies
Intelligent system technologies have paved the way to reshape modern transpor-
tation by incorporating new technological features into it, such as telecommuni-
cation, sensor system, positioning system, computing hardware, data processing,
planning processing, and virtual operation [8]. Some noteworthy uses of intelli-
gent system technologies in modern transportation are listed below [18]:
• Smart roads and parking: The number of vehicle tyres moving through the
ground can be sensed by such roads. In addition, drivers can receive instant noti-
fications with regard to traffic patterns and avoid congested roads subsequently.
Smart technologies can also manage parking availability dynamically and con-
tribute toward decreasing the time and fuel consumption required to search for a
parking slot.
• Electronic toll collection (ETC): The ETC system can facilitate the direct elec-
tronic debit from the registered vehicle owners without stopping them at a toll-
booth, and thus contribute to reducing delays, especially during high traffic. The
ETC system has already been deployed in many parts of the world. In particular,
Taiwan has implemented this technology on all of its motorways [19].
• Automated vehicles: A calibrated road technology integrated with sophisticated
cameras is utilized in these vehicles to drive automatically, i.e., no drivers are
required. However, its safety on complex roads has yet to be examined.
• Biometric Access: The vehicle owners can unlock and start vehicles with their
fingers and eyeballs – which are read and scanned flawlessly by the biometric
technology. Due to some operational advantages, fingerprint readers are more
widely accepted contrasting with retina scanners [20].
• Remote shutdown: This technology has primarily been introduced to prevent
theft. In fact, stolen vehicles can be closed down remotely with the help of this
technology. Remote shutdown is customarily implemented on the smartphones
of the vehicle owners. Because of its protection, the global market is growing,
which is expected to reach US$723.65 million by 2026 [21].
• Head-up display: This active window display can help the vehicle driver navigate
by providing vibrant images in regard to the distance between nearby vehicles.
• Health monitoring: The heartbeats of the drivers can be tracked either by seat
belt sensors or steering wheel sensors by dint of this technology, and hence
the active health monitoring of the vehicle driver can be possible. The idea
has been proposed by Ford company and they expect to bring it to reality in
upcoming years [22].
• Real-time information and comprehensive tracking: Real-time information in
regard to traffic conditions and congestion, road closures, and rerouting can
be provided by modern technologies to organize travel in the shortest possible
time. In fact, the travel distance of a vehicle can be tracked using comprehensive
44
3 Techno-Economic-Environmental Assessment of Green Transportation Systems

tracking technology. Some state governments and insurance companies are
intending to deploy the comprehensive vehicle tracking system [23].
• Road charging and congestion pricing: Intelligent technologies can be employed
to implement dynamic road pricing schemes to charge vehicles for the utiliza-
tion of congested roads with the purpose of evading traffic congestion and
improving road sustainability.
• Safety of heavy freight vehicles: Radar-driven active acceleration and braking sys-
tem, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, and Pelo-
ton technologies (i.e., automated mechanisms to solve challenges of fuel use and
crashes) can enable heavy freight vehicles to achieve energy saving, reduced
delivery time and accidents, and operational safety.
3.2.3
Integrated Management Technologies
Multifarious facets of travel needs are required to be taken into account while
addressing transportation and urbanization issues, which mainly include pattern
of transport growth and systematic use of available lands, emission rates of toxic
gases, advanced traffic management, and adequate infrastructure management.
All these features are interconnected and cannot be solved in an isolated fashion.
This necessitates the use of integrated management technologies in transporta-
tion [24].
In general, these technologies have five major goals, including baseline review,
target setting, political commitment, implementation and monitoring, and evalu-
ation and reporting. These goals are achieved by implementing technologies in
three different stages. In the first stage, substantial objectives are determined.
The second stage defines the indicators and task forces. The deliverable items
are finalized in the third stage [8]. A brief description of primary targets along with
subsequent tasks and deliverable items is encapsulated as follows:
• Baseline review: It is the first and foremost goal of integrated management tech-
nologies in the transportation system. It essentially reviews all the related data
and maps of emerging trends and issues, political priorities, organizational setup
and responsibilities, and consultation with stakeholders. Time saving and mini-
mized congestion are two ultimate deliverable items of the baseline review.
• Target setting: The second objective is to organize a favorable organizational
structure to drive the system. Significant priorities, issues, and indicators are
identified, and potential action plans are laid out to reach the responsibility
and time frame targets. Travel and vehicle efficiency are considered deliverable
items in the target setting.
• Political commitment: It deals with government strategic programs and vision,
public information strategy and sensitization, and partnership commitments
3.2 Technologies for Green Transportation Systems
45

with private businesses as well as national and regional authorities. The deliv-
erable items are increased travel and vehicle efficiency.
• Implementation and monitoring: They aim at performing strategic actions appro-
priately, arranging internal review of the actions undertaken regularly, refining
any action if necessary, monitoring results, and providing information to all
engaged stakeholders. Two paramount deliverable items are increased public
transportation and a lower health risk.
• Evaluation and reporting: This is the last goal of integrated management tech-
nologies, which focuses on evaluating the process and outcome and reporting on
actions. It also involves internal auditing in accordance with monitoring results.
Moreover, certification and public information are also taken care of. Increased
private investment is the principal deliverable item.
3.2.4
Distributed Ledger Technologies
Distributed ledger technologies denote the technological protocols that facilitate
the protection and well functioning of a digital and encrypted database, including
contemporary access, validation, and immutable records, without a direct inter-
vention of a central authority [25]. Blockchain is the most popular form of distrib-
uted ledger technology at present. It essentially integrates a set of chronologically
arranged blocks that are irreversible and organized by consensus-based protocols
and exercises an automatic hash algorithm to validate and store transactions in
these blocks [26]. Once any transaction is validated and recorded, the immutable
feature of blockchain does not permit changes [27].
There are four different categories of blockchain, namely public blockchain, pri-
vate blockchain, consortium blockchain, and hybrid blockchain. A public block-
chain allows everyone to participate in the blockchain network without any
permission in a decentralized manner, i.e., a permissionless blockchain. Examples
are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Private blockchains are entirely maintained
by a single authority and participation is subject to permission. Hyperledger and
Solana are examples of private blockchain. In consortium blockchain, permission
is needed to join, but unlike private blockchain, it is controlled by a group of autho-
rities to improve security. A single authority controls hybrid blockchains like pri-
vate blockchains, but some processes are executed without any permission [28].
Blockchain can find its application in green transportation systems to guarantee
traceability and transparency in the supply chain and manage resources effica-
ciously. The technology can also handle the charging and discharging of EVs in a
decentralized fashion. Blockchain-enabled coordination of EVs is driven by
multilateral computerized embedded agreements, commonly known as smart
46
3 Techno-Economic-Environmental Assessment of Green Transportation Systems

contracts[29].EVownerscanalsoparticipateinblockchain-empoweredpeer-to-peer
(P2P) mechanisms to charge and discharge their vehicles based on individual prefer-
ences [30]. Once coordinated/P2P charging and discharging patterns, rules, and con-
ditions are mutually agreed upon, the smart contracts are written on the blockchain
and cannot be removed or altered. Furthermore, a blockchain is rugged against a sin-
gle point offailure andnetwork members can beinvalidatedifit isrequiredfor sturdy
functioning [31].
Blockchain can be adopted to securely store various data sets of green transpor-
tation systems, which include data on fuel usage, carbon emission, running and
maintenance costs. This can assist in conducting better analysis, whenever neces-
sary, to report sustainability features of green transportations. Also, the privacy
and security of blockchain-driven transportation systems can be ensured
by employing challenge-response protocols, digital signatures, entity authenti-
cation, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, pseudonyms, non-likability, and
asymmetric cryptographic private and public keys in its platform. Mixing, zero-
knowledge proofs, and ring signatures are typical examples of such blockchain-
based methods [32].
In addition, blockchain can allow EV owners to track and monitor their char-
ging and discharging transactions in an automated way. Transactions’ data and
history are always preserved in the blockchain database and are also available
to the energy retailers (if they have blockchain accounts) for periodic billing. Dig-
ital currency, designated as a token, can also be incorporated to settle payments
with confidentiality. In other words, blockchain has the potential to introduce
an electronic billing system in the transportation sector [31].
3.3
Economic Implications of Green
Transportation Systems
Adequate infrastructure, efficient operational technologies, and coordinated net-
work systems of green transportation can play a vital role in economic growth as
basic goods and services can easily be accessed swiftly at cheaper prices while envi-
ronmental sustainability is guaranteed [34]. A statistic states that environmental
pollutants (considered in the long-range energy alternative planning system model)
like nitrogen oxide, nitrous oxide, sulfur oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, car-
bon monoxide, methane, and non-methane volatile organic compounds incur
US$0.33/kg, US$0.91/kg, US$1.16/kg, US$0.0019/kg, US$0.018/kg, US$0.049/kg,
and US$1.35/kg, respectively [35]. These costs can be avoided completely or miti-
gated remarkably by the adoption of sustainable transportation.
3.3 Economic Implications of Green Transportation Systems
47

The financial benefits of green transportation can be analyzed from two points of
view in general: cost savings to vehicle owners and employment creation in the job
market [2].
3.3.1
Cost Saving
The latest research undertaken by the World Resources Institute reports that the
world needs US$2 trillion in capital investment on low-carbon transportations,
and it is projected that US$300 billion could be saved annually compared to fos-
sil-fueled transportations. This emphasizes the necessity of investing in green
transportation when cost-effective transportation is one of the targets of modern
society [36].
The overall running and maintenance costs of sustainable transportation are
also substantially lower than those of internal combustion engine-driven vehicles,
although the capital prices of batteries – which are the heart of EVs – are still com-
paratively expensive. Proterra, an EV manufacturer, demonstrates that an electric
bus can save approximately €49,000 in running and maintenance costs over the
period of five years in comparison with a standard passenger-carrying bus.
Another EV manufacturer, called New Flyer, reports that a typical electric bus
can cut down around €393,550 and €123,000 in fuel and maintenance expenses,
respectively, over its lifetime [37].
The investment in electric cars can also bring significant cost savings in the long
run. According to Australia’s Electric Vehicle Council (EVC), the average cost of
powering petrol-driven vehicles ranges between AU$1.50/l and AU$2/l. On the
contrary, the equivalent EV cost would be close to AU$0.33/l, resulting in an
impressive fuel cost saving. The motoring body also claims that the annual run-
ning cost savings could be around AU$1600 on average (70% cheaper) if fuel-
powered cars are replaced by electric cars [38].
Further, electric cars do not experience rigorous maintenance like their fuel-
based counterparts. In fact, electric cars are free from some well-known services
required for internal combustion engines, such as fuel changes and prolonging
brake life through regenerative braking, resulting in lower maintenance costs.
An analysis of Consumer Reports finds that electric car owners need to spend half
as much on maintenance and repair costs on average, contrasting with petrol-
driven vehicle owners. In other words, electric car owners can save 50% more
in maintenance and repair costs [39].
On top of it, governmental incentives are also available to EV owners to save
money on vehicle charges that include registration fees and stamp duties. For
instance, in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the registration fees of electric
car owners are waived for two years while stamp duties are completely exempted.
48
3 Techno-Economic-Environmental Assessment of Green Transportation Systems

Moreover, zero-interest loans, from AU$2000 to AU$15,000, are also offered to EV
owners to promote the usage of zero-emission vehicles [40].
3.3.2
Job Creation
A wide range of employment opportunities can be created by investing in green
transportation systems. These jobs could be of three types: direct jobs, indirect jobs,
and induced jobs. Direct jobs can be generated from the construction, manufactur-
ing, and maintenance activities related to green transport, which include the
assembly and repair of various EVs, the construction of bicycle lanes and parking,
pavements, the coordination of modern technologies, and wholesale and retail
market settlements. The production of materials and parts for EVs and bicycles,
initialization of green transport system layout, and development of required tech-
nologies are typical examples of some indirect jobs. On the other hand, green
transportations aim at providing cost savings to owners (e.g., private EVs) and
users (e.g., public EVs). These savings are more likely to be spent in the overall
economy, which can also contribute to creating induced jobs in society [41].
Some cities in the world are putting significant efforts to promote the bicycle job
market. One of them is the city of Portland, Oregon, USA. It launched its Bicycle
Master Plan back in 1996 to encourage its dwellers to cycle and enlarge the biking
network. At present, nearly 6–8% of its commuters are bicycle commuters. The
sizes of its bikeways, bike lanes, and off-street bike paths are 314 mi, 202 mi,
and 76 mi, respectively [42].
The implication of advocating the use of bicycles has been outstanding on the
local job market of Portland. The job opportunities in different sectors, such as
entertainment and recreation, manufacturing, retail, and wholesale trades, in
the city from 2015 to 2025 are depicted in Table 3.2. As is observed, total employ-
ment opportunities are projected to increase in 2025 compared to 2015 and 2020.
Jobs related to bicycle manufacturing and retail trade may diminish slightly in

2025. However, both wholesale trade and the entertainment and recreation sectors
are expected to create greater numbers of jobs in the city, resulting in an overall
escalation in the job market [43].
Nevertheless, EVs also have the potential to bring dramatic changes to job sec-
tors globally. A case study published in [44] suggests that US$8.61 and US$0.59
trillion of incremental investment in passenger and freight EVs would facilitate
the world receiving US$320.42 and US$79.85 billion in annual returns, respec-
tively, in 2030. Besides, 3.6 and 0.1 million jobs, respectively, would be created
in passenger and freight transportations in the same year. In total, a US$7.20 tril-
lion investment in EVs across the world would see US$7.20 billion in annual
returns and creation of 3.7 million jobs, as illustrated in Table 3.3.
3.4
Environmental Implications of Green
Transportation Systems
Environmental assessment mainly addresses the issues caused by transportation
in the environment as part of the decision-making process in modern societies.
The characteristics of transportation are considered for the base year and horizon
year (i.e., the expected growth year) while analyzing the impacts on the environ-
ment [45]. The pivotal environmental concerns of transportation are toxic gas
emissions and threat to human health [37]. Thus, green transportation aims at
scaling down environmental pollution (for better air quality and noise level)
and improving human health status.
3.4.1
Lowering Emission of Pollutants
Complying with the Paris Agreement, many countries in the world have set their
targets to lower acidifying gas emissions and ambient pollution (e.g., carbon

dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and suspended particulate matter) from various sectors
that include transportation. For instance, Australia’s 17% greenhouse gas emis-
sions come from transportation, figuring at 96 megatons per year. While the trans-
portation sector in Australia is experiencing unprecedented growth in recent
times, the country is committed to achieving zero net emissions by the end of
2050 [46].
According to Australian National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA) factors [47], a
standard diesel-powered bus consumes nearly 0.3-l fuel/km traveled and emits
0.815232 kg of carbon/km traveled. The average carbon emission intensity
becomes 4.402253 kg/km for a fleet. The adoption of EVs can contribute greatly
to reducing carbon emission intensity toward zero and cut down on significant
expenditures on carbon prices. The analysis has found that the abated carbon
emission of a bus and a fleet would be 652 and 35,218 tons, respectively, over
the period of eight years if conventional vehicles were replaced by EVs. In return,
around AU$19,566 and AU$1,056,541 could be saved, respectively, as a result of
carbon offsets.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that hybrid
vehicles held at share of 9% of all produced vehicles in 2021, and this figure is
expected to grow in the upcoming years. In 2021, the carbon emission rate of
all vehicles in the USA plummeted to 347 g/mi on average, which was 25% lower
than that of the model year 2004. The real-world average fuel economy (i.e., the
relationship between traveled distance and fuel consumption) increased by 32%
or 6.1 mpg. For this study, vehicles were divided into five classes, which include
SUV, sedan/wagon, minivan/van, truck SUV, and pickup truck. Among them,
sedans and wagons were labeled as the vehicles with the lowest carbon emissions
and highest fuel economy [48].
Vehicle manufacturers are also contributing substantially to achieving compli-
ance with the greenhouse gas emission standards by employing several cutting-
edge technologies. While Tesla did not produce any carbon due to their all-electric
fleets as displayed in Table 3.4, other manufacturers generated some sorts of car-
bon gases ranging from 309 g/mi (the lowest achieved by Subaru) to 385 g/mi (the
highest achieved by Ford) in 2021.
Compared to 2016, Kia and Toyota ensured the largest reduction in carbon emis-
sions, by 28 g/mi each, in 2021. The fuel economy of Kia and Toyota increased by
2.5 mpg and 2.1 mpg, respectively, over this period. Honda, Nissan, and BMW also
had an abatement in carbon emissions during the course of five years, figuring at 3
g/mi, 7 g/mi, and 10 g/mi, respectively. Meanwhile, their fuel economy exhibited
an upsurge at 0.7 mpg, 0.8 mpg, and 2.1 mpg, respectively. Mercedes, on the con-
trary, showed unchanged variations in both carbon emissions and fuel economy
between model years 2016 and 2021 [48]. The detailed comparisons among vehicle
manufacturers are demonstrated in Table 3.4.

3.4.2
Improving Human Health Status
Toxic emissions from fuel-driven vehicles are responsible for numerous human
health issues, including cancer, bronchitis, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, for example. In Australia, between
900 and 2000 early deaths are caused every year by the air pollution coming from
motor vehicles. Further, between 900 and 4500 bronchitis, cardiovascular, and res-
piratory disease cases are recorded, costing between AU$1.5 and AU$3.8 billion for
health treatments [49]. Green transportations can protect and promote human
health by dropping down health risks and diseases resulting from vehicular air pol-
lutants, saving a lot of money otherwise required for health treatments [2].
A European research study has found that the life expectancy in urban areas is
reduced by nine months on average due to ambient particulate matter pollution
generated from vehicles. Each year, pollution also leads to 482,000 premature
deaths in Europe. Moreover, the overall cost of these health concerns is valued
at around US$1.2 trillion annually. Based on the study, people’s health is jeopar-
dized owing to motorized transportation with significant greenhouse gas emis-
sions. Elderly, homeless, and poor people, along with children, are affected
disproportionately, causing health inequalities at an alarming rate [50].
To this end, the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe introduced a health
framework related to sustainable transportations in 2020 with the purpose of redu-
cing health concerns by minimizing emissions of pollutants and strengthening the
link between public health and transportation in European regions. The governing

bodies are also working toward developing coherent policies to invest in environ-
ment-friendly transportation to improve human health status [50].
Another research study conducted by Chinese researchers in 2019, reported in
Ref. [51], outlines that thousands of lives could be saved by the initiation of green
transportations. In this analysis, they modeled a scenario in which 27% of the total
transportations was assumed to be EVs, and a mix of renewable sources and coals
were considered as primary power sources. They adopted an atmospheric chem-
istry transport layout to determine the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, ozone,
and particulate pollution. Their experiment showed positive air quality and better
health benefits. In fact, the cuts in atmospheric pollution could prevent approxi-
mately 17,500 deaths by 2030.
Finally, a pilot project is going on in Accra, Ghana, to demonstrate how green
transportations can protect and promote health [52]. In particular, to integrate
health action in transport, the Urban Health Initiative (UHI) model is processed
in the project in six steps as follows:
• Step 1: Existing transport policies mainly related to air pollution and human
health are mapped considering the involvement of key stakeholders.
• Step 2: Policy-makers are directed to build competencies in evaluating health
and financial effects of transportation policies.
• Step 3: Various tools, such as integrated sustainable transport and health assess-
ment tool (iSThAT), integrated transport and health impact modeling tool
(ITHIM), and health economic assessment tool (HEAT), are locally used to carry
out the health and economic assessment of green transportations.
• Step 4: Alternative scenarios are also considered to estimate potential health and
financial impacts.
• Step 5: Campaigns are arranged to intensify the need for green transportations.
• Step 6: Incentives are provided to act, monitor, and track green transportation
initiatives.

Introduction
One of the main sectors responsible for the worldwide climate crisis is
transportation. Transportation is mainly known as the second main contributor
to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, after energy, around the world, with almost
27% pollution in the United States [1] and approximately 18% in Australia. In par-
ticular, freight transportation accounts for roughly 50% of all transport emissions
and 7–8% of all CO2 emissions [2]. Furthermore, according to [3], given predictions
for worldwide economic and population expansion as well as the present average
distance covered per freight unit [4], freight transport operations are expected to be
more than twice by 2050 in comparison with 2015. The goals set as per the Paris
Agreement at the EU level to be accomplished in 2025–2030 and by 2050 are mark-
edly different from this scenario. Additionally, in September 2020, the European
Commission (EC) proposed to increase the reduction target of GHG emissions for
2030, which includes both removals and emissions, to atleast 55% below the levels
of 1990 in accordance with the European Green Deal. Yet, considering the present
rate of GHG emissions, the most concerning fact is that warming is expected to
approach 1.5 C by 2030s [5].
Urbanization, on the other hand, is contributing to increased energy consump-
tion and demand for larger transport networks. Hence, planning a low-emission,
responsive, and well-designed transport system is crucial for achieving sustaina-
bility. However, there are numerous challenges in implementing low-emission
and environmentally friendly transportation systems. From the economic

perspective, transforming the transport sector into a sustainable system requires
significant investment in both infrastructure and technology. Safety and security
risks associated with promoting alternative modes of transportation are also
among the challenges needing serious attention.
Although achieving accessible, affordable, and efficient urban transport requires
addressing various challenges in an integrated manner, there are several social,
environmental, and economic benefits associated with the implementation of sus-
tainable transport. Improved access to affordable transport services, increased
physical activity, and reduced social inequalities are some instances of social ben-
efits that can be achieved by sustainability. Environmental benefits include
reduced local air pollutants and GHG emissions, improved air quality, and
reduced noise pollution. From the economic point of view, benefits include cost
savings for transport users and providers, reduced healthcare costs, and new job
opportunities. A well-designed integrated transport system can help create more
sustainable cities by reducing dependencies on personal vehicles as an economic
objective. These significant benefits are the major motivation for promoting,
implementing, and adopting the modes of sustainable transportation.
These modes are adopted in various countries based on the availability of facil-
ities and government policies that encourage their usage. Some of these modes are
quite healthy in terms of exercise and activeness such as walking and cycling
although they have constraints regarding longer distances and extreme weather
conditions. On the other hand, some modes are significantly beneficial for our
environment and their adoption can help not only in cleaning the atmosphere
from GHG emissions but also in the reduction of serious health issues pertaining
to adverse effects of polluted environment. Examples of such sustainable modes
are electric bikes, electric scooters, electric cars, electric buses, and electric trains.
Some modes are relatively inexpensive and provide social benefits such as carpool-
ing. A consistent adoption of these modes at a global scale can shift the current
adverse climate change situation upside down. The implementation of these
modes of sustainable transportation requires successful urban planning.
Urban planning is essential to guarantee that cities have the equitable and sus-
tainable transportation infrastructure they require for urban growth. To promote
healthy transportation systems, urban planners must promote walking, cycling,
and other efficient modes of travel. Sustainable transport not only protects the
environment and people’s well-being, but it also provides better connectivity
and drives productivity in modern smart cities. In other words, sustainable trans-
port has an immense role to play in urban economic growth as it safeguards
resources. Sustainable transport can reduce transportation costs, create job oppor-
tunities, and attract investments, businesses, tourists, and other economic drivers.
Furthermore, sustainable transport infrastructures like bike lanes or pedestrian
walkways and transit systems make it simpler for people and businesses to get
goods and services, ultimately stimulating economic activity. In short, urban

planning plays a significant role in the implementation of sustainable transporta-
tion infrastructure that requires a comprehensive integration of different
infrastructures.
These infrastructures include mobility, energy, and society. Traditionally, these
different sectors have had separate planning and operation processes without
taking care of each other. For example, transportation planners have not been
concerned about the electricity grid when they design city bus routes and sche-
dules. However, with the emergence of electric buses, the transport network
and electricity grid should be more coordinated. From the governance perspective,
establishing sustainable transportation requires significant investment in upgrad-
ing the transport and energy infrastructure. It includes the cost of upgrading the
electrical system, e.g., for transformers and substations, and modifications in the
transport network, such as the construction of charging stations.
It has been shown that investing in major infrastructure is likely to be ineffective
during transition to sustainable transport, unless accompanied by local actions
and policies using small-scale investments. Thus, establishing an integrated gov-
ernance framework for transition to sustainable transportation is key. Last, but not
least, is the society engagement. A glance at trials shows that this item is even more
important than technical problems in the success of transition to public transport.
For example, investment in establishing a cycling track in an area where people
have difficulties in basic infrastructures, such as water or electricity, may cause
a negative pushback for the public.
This chapter encompasses various significant aspects of sustainable transporta-
tion networks that are shown in Figure 4.1. This chapter mainly contributes to pro-
viding a holistic comprehensive review of these aspects considering cutting-edge
technologies and case studies at a global scale that is missing in the existing liter-
ature. It begins with highlighting the true motivation for transitioning toward sus-
tainable transportation and proceeds by providing insights into the challenges and
opportunities for its implementation. It further elaborates on various modes of sus-
tainable transportation along with modern urban advancement and concludes
with a detailed discussion on sustainable infrastructure. This holistic review not
only adds considerable value to the existing literature but also provides a starting
point for those researchers, who are newcomers in this field and want to have a
proper structure of the problem. Moreover, it is quite beneficial for the policy-

4.2
Necessity of Sustainable Transportation
In view of the continuously increasing issues regarding climate change and public
health caused by the conventional fuel-based transportation system, the imple-
mentation of sustainable transportation has become inevitable. The impact of
these critical issues is discussed below.
4.2.1
Impact of Conventional Transportation on Climate Change
One of the sectors that contributes the most to pollution and emissions in urban
areas is transportation [6]. Transportation-related emissions, particularly the
amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, are a major contributor to both climate

change and environmental pollution [6]. Air pollutant emissions (APE) and GHG
emissions are primarily two forms of emissions that have a negative impact on the
environment [7]. CO2 is one of the GHGs that is released into the atmosphere and
has the ability to trap additional solar heat. The resultant rise in temperature is
known as the “Greenhouse Effect,” which causes unfavorable changes in climate.
This hazardous GHG is released into the atmosphere in large quantities as a result
of motor vehicle use [6].
On the contrary, APE is a mixture of numerous chemicals, including nitrogen
oxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and many other dangerous organic com-
pounds, like benzene. It also consists of emissions of particulate matter. These pol-
lutants are a by-product of vehicle emissions into the atmosphere. These pollutants
have the potential to cause fatal conditions like heart disease, cancer, lung infec-
tion, and aggravated asthma [8].
The excellent performance of the transportation sector is crucial for our eco-
nomic stability and social life, yet it continues to be one of the main causes of envi-
ronmental damage in the modern world. Over 70% of pollution is caused by
transportation, including cars, wagons, and public transportation in the EU [9].
Adverse climate shifts and severe weather conditions, which have reportedly hap-
pened globally throughout time, are mostly the result of the uncontrolled utiliza-
tion of fossil fuels and excessive carbon emissions. The Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) that the United Nations (UN) has established also witness to the
need for mitigating ecological impact and promoting all preventive and precau-
tionary measures [10].
4.2.2
Impact of Transportation-related Emissions on Public Health
Nowadays, roads are flooded with private vehicles as a result of which the trans-
portation sector shares the responsibility for the increasing issues for public health
such as smog, air acidification, road accidents, and carbon dioxide emissions. The
road transportation industry, which also contributes significantly to elevated levels
of other elements including hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, is the main
source of these air pollutants in the majority of international cities. These elevated
levels play an important role in a number of respiratory and cardiovascular dis-
eases. Transport-related pollutants have been directly linked to bronchitis, heart
attacks, asthma, strokes, and other illnesses in numerous epidemiological studies
[11]. Out of the total CO2 emissions, the transport sector produced 24% [12].
The interaction of humans with the environment is greatly influenced by non-
renewable energy sources-based transportation systems. In 2010, CO2 emissions of
7 gigatonnes were produced directly by the transportation sector. Compared to
emissions from other sectors (i.e., agriculture, industry, power, commercial, or res-
idential), GHG emissions of annual transportation are rising more quickly. In the
4.2 Necessity of Sustainable Transportation
63

upcoming years, it is anticipated that transportation demand will rise significantly
as income levels rise and infrastructure around the globe expands. By 2050, annual
emissions from the transportation industry are anticipated to double [13].
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the US, the trans-
portation industry was the greatest producer of GHG emissions in the country in
2016, responsible for 28.5% of all national GHG emissions, which are related to
the energy sector. As per the most recent Energy Information Administration
(EIA) figures, from October 2015 to September 2016, the transportation sector in
the US produced CO2 emissions of 1893 million metric tonnes (MMt) which was
more than that of the power sector i.e., 1803 MMt [14]. If increased renewable
energy production reduces the amount of electricity produced using fossil fuels,
which further reduces emissions from the power sector, this trend is expected to
continue [15].
4.2.3
Role of Road Transportation in Carbon Emissions
In comparison with other forms of transportation including rail, marine, and avi-
ation, road transportation accounts for the biggest percentage of energy consump-
tion and CO2 emissions. The GHG emissions from the transportation sector in the
United States in 2016 were 22.9%, 18%, and 41.6% for freight trucks, light-duty
trucks, and passenger cars, respectively [14]. Emissions by road transportation
must be a primary priority of mitigation policies because they surged more than
emissions generated by any other industry between 1990 and 2016. It is, therefore,
possible to significantly reduce the environmental effects of the transportation
industry as a whole by systematically developing and implementing innovative
technology to limit the impacts of road transportation [15].
One of the primary areas where emissions are still increasing is transportation,
which contributes to around one-fourth of worldwide GHG emissions [16–18].
Road transportation makes up over 50% of all GHG emissions related to the trans-
portation sector, making it the single-largest emitter within the transportation
industry. The world’s efforts to minimize GHG emissions caused by the transpor-
tation sector are being impeded by the rapidly expanding demand for mobility and
the ownership of private vehicles [5]. The mitigation of GHG emissions in trans-
port to control climate change issues will be more difficult compared to other sec-
tors [19, 20] due to society’s continued dependence on fossil fuels.
4.2.4
Existing Global Energy Market
Technological advancements and growing population around the globe have
resulted in the rapid increase in energy demand. Although the use of fossil fuels
has threatening impact on human health [16, 17] as well as the atmosphere, they
still maintain a dominating position in the energy sector. Burning of fossil fuels
64
4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

causes the emission of hazardous gases like nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and
methane. It is also predicted that there will be a tremendous increase in such emis-
sions due to the growth of industrial and urban sectors. If we will not shift toward
green energy resources, the increasing levels of these detrimental gases will not
only deteriorate our health and environment but also cause unexpected changes
in our whole ecosystem [18]. Humans will experience the most adverse effects in
the form of potential health problems and unavoidable climate catastrophes due to
the excessive use of fossil fuels [19, 21].
4.2.5
Potential Approaches for Mitigating Emissions
Different countries have taken decisive steps to get rid of the hazards caused by
transportation-related emissions. To reduce these issues, governments have begun
reconsidering their energy policies and regulations. Several strategies have been
proposed to either completely or partially reduce GHGs and the consequences they
cause. Other potential approaches include increasing the effectiveness of existing
technologies [20, 22], creating new, efficient technology that has less negative
environmental effects [23, 24], and/or making a partial or complete switch to
renewable energy sources [25, 26]. Indeed, it is the most potential approach to
quickly phase out fossil fuels [27].
Decarbonatization is among the many steps that have been taken around the
globe to address the pollution crisis caused by traffic congestion. In recent years,
there has been an increase in the emissions reductions of the transportation sector
through the use of EVs in urban areas. EVs are anticipated to have the potential to
lessen both environmental pollution and the current energy problem [6]. Passen-
ger automobiles account for about 12% of the total EU emissions of carbon dioxide,
while light commercial vehicles or vans account for about 2.5% [28]. The EU has
implemented a number of strict regulations to decrease emissions from transpor-
tation. One amongst them would be to establish goals for a percentage decrease in
CO2 emissions starting in 2021 [29]. For cars, it is 15% reduction in 2025 and 37.5%
reduction in 2030. For vans, in 2025 and 2030, there will be a 15% and 31% reduc-
tion, respectively.
4.3
Challenges and Opportunities Associated with the
Implementation of Sustainable Transportation
Achieving sustainable transport requires solution strategies that can pave the
way for the development of low-emission and environment-friendly transport
systems. However, there are various challenges in the underlying system that
can hinder the successful implementation of sustainable transportation. This
4.3 Challenges and Opportunities Associated with the Implementation of Sustainable Transportation
65

section summarizes some of the major challenges and benefits associated with
the development of sustainable integrated transport as follows.
4.3.1
Growing Car Sector
The latest energy and carbon emission figures show that transport accounts for
24% of global CO2 emissions (if only energy-related emissions are considered),
with road transport responsible for almost 76% of the carbon emissions in the
transport sector [30, 31], a considerable proportion that can potentially get larger
with the continuously growing number of cars worldwide. According to the latest
global figures, it is projected that the motorization rate will increase from 92 vehi-
cles per 1000 people in 2020 to 173 vehicles per 1000 people by 2050 [32]. It is also
estimated that the number of light-duty vehicles worldwide will continue to grow
to over two billion vehicles by 2050, with around 70% of them still operating with
fossil fuels. It is worth mentioning that the COVID-19 pandemic and its related
restrictions have amplified the situation, with urban dwellers willing to use their
private cars rather than traveling with others due to higher risks of infection
[33, 34]. Consequently, the transport sector will inevitably need to deal with the
increased use of conventional private vehicles.
4.3.2
Urban Growth
There is a direct relationship between urbanization, the gradual shift in residence
of the human population from rural to urban areas, and energy used for transpor-
tation, mainly because the transport network becomes larger when urban areas
spread out. The latest revision of World Urbanization Prospects [35] estimates that
the world’s population in urban areas will increase from 55% in 2018 to 68% by
2050. With the rapid urbanization trend around the world, accelerated by the
COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging trend of flexible working, suburban areas
have been growing faster, and we can expect increased transport demand in outer
suburbs. Hence, transport providers may need to increase their supply to account
for those shifted demands.
4.3.3
Transformation Cost
A fully sustainable transport is not achieved unless all its key elements are trans-
formed in a way that they become part of an environmentally friendly ecosystem.
Nonetheless, funding plays a key role in the fulfillment of a successful transforma-
tion. In many cases, this transition requires significant investment in both infra-
structure and technology, with the associated costs later reflected in the relative
price of services. According to the Global Infrastructure Outlook [36], it is
66
4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

estimated that $2 trillion in transport infrastructure investments would be needed
every year until 2040 to upgrade the infrastructure [37]. Hence, when it comes to
sustainable transport, it is crucial for the transport sector to budget for the trans-
formation cost well before implementation, and to ensure their services are still
affordable and accessible for all users when they are operational.
4.3.4
Planning Challenges
One of the main objectives of sustainable transport is improving the efficiency of
transport in urban areas by either provisioning new means of transport, such as
providing bike lanes, or the efficient use of resources and urban space, such as by
designing integrated transport services. In addition, a responsive transport sys-
tem may require structural changes over the long run to implement new technol-
ogies or to reflect changes in policies or demands. However, the lack of enough
resources allocated to the development and implementation of an environmen-
tally friendly transport system (such as land, money, equipment, etc.) is a critical
challenge that can seriously limit the benefits of sustainability in such integrated
systems, especially in areas that host large-scale transport demands. To this end,
achieving sustainability in the transport sector requires careful planning to
ensure a well-designed and responsive transport system via demand-oriented
strategies such as push-and-pull and avoid-shift-improve (ASI) [38, 39], which
offer a more comprehensive approach for an overall sustainable transport system
design.
4.3.5
Safety Risks
With an increased focus on reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality,
sustainable transport requires promoting cycling and walking as alternative
modes of transportation. However, the lack of dedicated bike lanes and safe
pedestrian crossings can lead to accidents and injuries. According to global
reports, road traffic accidents are the top cause of death for individuals between
the ages of 15 and 29, with pedestrians and cyclists accounting for approximately
35% of these fatalities [11, 40]. Furthermore, the emergence of low-noise trans-
port technologies, such as EVs, has raised new safety concerns due to their quiet
operation. Unlike conventional fuel-powered vehicles, the electrified driveline in
modern vehicles produces significantly less noise, which can make them harder
for pedestrians and cyclists to hear, particularly for those with impaired hearing
or sight. Nonetheless, the installation of high-capacity infrastructure, such as fast
charging equipment for EVs, may pose a significant danger to public safety, espe-
cially in areas with high population density. This includes the risk of electric
4.3 Challenges and Opportunities Associated with the Implementation of Sustainable Transportation
67

shock caused by cable or plug damages, which can be exacerbated by severe
weather conditions.
4.3.6
Security Challenges
Integration in transport systems often relies on utilizing data, software, and sen-
sors to coordinate and optimize the operation of the key system components and,
consequently, enhance the driving experience. Hence, one of the primary issues
in smart transport platforms is the vulnerability of such integrated systems to
cyberattacks. As integrated transportation systems become more prevalent, they
rely on more complex networks of interconnected technologies, creating a larger
attack surface for cybercriminals. In addition, implementing sustainable trans-
port infrastructure, such as EV charging stations, involves substantial invest-
ment, making them vulnerable to copper theft and vandalism. Such criminal
activities can result in the exposure of wiring, posing a significant risk of injury
or even fatalities.
As discussed above, to achieve accessible, affordable, and efficient urban trans-
port, various challenges need to be addressed in an integrated manner. In gen-
eral, urban transport is intricately linked with urban life, and thus it is critically
important to understand the benefits of sustainable transport to society as a
whole. Recent studies show that increasing public awareness of traffic problems
and perceived benefits of sustainability can play a significant role in producing
more informed policy interventions and promoting sustainable transport
[41, 42]. Besides key advantages such as safer transport services and less traffic
congestion, as shown in Figure 4.2, there are various social, environmental, and

economic aspects in which the transport sector can reap the benefits of
sustainability.
4.3.7
Social Benefits
Implementing a sustainable, integrated transport system can provide the society
with improved access to affordable transport services and increased physical activ-
ity. It can also help to better recognize and address the specific needs of vulnerable
groups and communities by reducing social inequalities regarding access to trans-
port services. Sustainable modes such as public transport and biking infrastructure
can help to increase social inclusion by providing affordable and accessible trans-
portation for people with limited mobility, low-income households, and other
marginalized groups. Meanwhile, reduced travel time in optimized demand-
serving scenarios can potentially lead to time-efficient transport modes, saving
the transport user’s time by shortening overall trip duration. Furthermore, a sus-
tainable transport system can make the use of new transport modes possible or
even help change traditional transport modes to more sustainable ones. Some
examples are building bike and walking paths in city areas to help society take
advantage of reduced congestion, less parking pressure, and lower health risks,
or changing conventional bus services with bus rapid transit (BRT) as a cost-
and time-efficient transport mean with dedicated bus lanes.
4.3.8
Environmental Benefits
One of the key features of sustainable transport is the reduced number of motor-
ized/conventional vehicles, known as the source of local air pollutants, combus-
tion noise, and greenhouse effect. Sustainable transport options such as biking,
walking, and using electrified transport services can improve the quality of life
for individuals living in urban areas by preserving natural resources and reducing
noise pollution. More importantly, by incorporating sustainability and integration
into urban mobility, the transport sector can help reduce transport emission and
contribute to a healthier environment through enabling active transport modes
(e.g., walking or cycling). For example, a recent case study on a sustainable public
transport project in Rzeszów, Poland, estimates that replacing 52 old buses with
new low-emission buses contributes to a reduction of 201.9 tonnes in GHG emis-
sions [33]. Besides actions taken to reduce greenhouse emissions, emerging tech-
nologies such as electric and fuel-cell vehicles can play critical roles in improving
air quality. A transition away from fossil fuel-powered fleets to zero-carbon solu-
tions, such as EVs, can not only alleviate climate change concerns but also gener-
ate co-benefits for wider use of renewable energy sources.

4.3.9
Economic Benefits
In view of the transport user’s perspective, sustainable transport methods such as
biking, walking, and public transport are affordable options that can effectively
help save the increasing cost of fuel, parking, and maintenance associated with
private cars. In addition, sustainable transport options such as biking and walking
can promote physical activity, which can reduce healthcare costs associated with
inactive lifestyles. With energy-efficient technologies implemented in the trans-
port system, from high-efficient electrified fleets to optimized route-planning stra-
tegies, transport provides a significant reduction in the operation cost in terms of
total energy consumption. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors such as changes
in driving patterns due to less congested roads, less demand for car travel due
to improved public transport accessibility, shifting conventional travel modes to
more efficient ones due to effective urban planning, and presenting policies
enforcing efficiency improvements can all help achieve a cost-effective integrated
transport framework. The other benefit associated with the implementation of sus-
tainable transport is the presence of entirely new transport solutions incorporating
a range of new technologies. As part of transitioning to sustainable transport, new
technologies are needed to accommodate the need for eco-friendly systems. The
deployment of new technologies can positively impact economic and social aspects
of sustainability, mainly because new job opportunities are created in such inte-
grated systems. For instance, a recent study on Europe’s 2050 carbon-neutral tar-
gets illustrates that more than 1.5 million new jobs could be expected as part of the
gradual transition to renewable energy production in the transport and electricity
sectors [43]. Nonetheless, a well-designed, integrated, transport system can help
create more sustainable cities by reducing dependencies on vehicles as an eco-
nomic objective (via digital transformation and the consequent service economy)
[44, 45]. In other words, sustainable transport can foster economic development
via improving the efficiency and accessibility of the overall transport system.
4.4
Modes of Sustainable Transportation
There are several modes of sustainable transportation. Their implementation on a
global scale can effectively reduce GHG emissions and can contribute significantly
to the improvement of existing environmental issues. These modes are elabo-
rated below.
4.4.1
Walk
The simplest mode of sustainable transportation for local places is walking, which
can not only save money but also keep us healthy. Indeed, it is an excellent form of
exercise without following any particular schedule. Walking longer distances can
70
4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

be made comfortable with shoe inserts and good-quality jogger shoes. Move your
body and benefit the environment by going for a walk with friends, family, or even
by yourself [46]. It is preferable to walk to work, school, grocery stores, and other
nearby destinations. Walking is free, it emits no GHGs, and it’s also an excellent
type of physical training for the body [47]. Walking benefits your heart’s health,
your quality of life, and the health of your city. Hence, if you make five trips of
less than 2 km/week on foot, you cut 86 kg off your annual carbon footprint.
By preferring walking over driving personal conveyance, one can contribute sig-
nificantly to the reduction of air pollutants, which is quite essential for a clean
environment and healthy lifestyle. A study demonstrates that the health advan-
tages of walking in a typical metropolitan setting outweigh the drawbacks by walk-
ing only for 16 hours [48].
4.4.2
Bicycle
This is an obvious choice. Bicycling to work is a fantastic way to travel sustainably.
Bicycling instead of using a car makes a significant contribution to reducing GHG
emissions. Although walking is a fantastic environmentally friendly way of trans-
portation, riding a bicycle has numerous advantages because it is quicker and pro-
vides its own sort of exercise. These days, bicycles can be purchased for incredibly
affordable prices. Purchasing and maintaining a bicycle only costs a small portion
of that of an automobile [47]. The use of bicycles to reach where you want to go has
been around for centuries. You never have to be concerned about these forms of
transportation having a negative influence on the environment by making loud
noises or releasing hazardous emissions such as carbon monoxide into the atmos-
phere [46].
It should not be a surprise that walking and riding a bicycle are the most envi-
ronmentally friendly modes of transportation. In addition to having zero carbon
dioxide emissions at every level, they are also fun and healthy. Of course, it would
not always be possible for you to ride a cycle everywhere you want to go, but if you
have to choose between a 10-minute bus ride and a 20-minute bicycle ride, the lat-
ter would be better for the environment and for you. Numerous nations and towns
are launching campaigns and initiatives to promote cycling. The goal of the USA is
to build a coast-to-coast bicycle path. From the nation’s capital to the west of Seat-
tle (Pacific Ocean), the Great American Rail Trail travels 3700 miles through
12 states. A 62-mile cycling expressway will be opened in Germany just for cyclists.
Ten western cities will be connected by this motorway, along with four colleges, in
a move to promote more environmentally friendly transportation.
Cycling is indeed environmentally friendly, social, cathartic, calming, and a
great way to see the world. They are also the best and most affordable method
to see a new city [49]. The statistics for cycling are equally encouraging: if you
4.4 Modes of Sustainable Transportation
71

pedal 5 miles to work 4 days a week, you avoid driving 3220 km. At least 750 kg of
CO2 emissions and 380 l of gasoline consumption can be saved. Cycling is frequent
and the quickest form of transportation in cities, especially during rush hours. As a
result, cyclists are less likely to be exposed to air pollution since they spend rela-
tively less time in traffic. In this aspect, a report demonstrates that the health
advantages of cycling in an urban setting only exceed the drawbacks after six hours
of cycling [48].
4.4.3
Electric Bike/Scooter
Electric bikes are excellent eco-friendly means of transportation because they do
not pollute the environment with hazardous emissions. It only takes a little ped-
aling to move an electric bike. Yet, there are many legal restrictions on how fast
electric bikes can go. Some nations cap the top speed of electric bikes at 20 mph.
Yet, in certain nations, riding an electric bike requires a specific registration, insur-
ance, and license [47]. Supporters of low-emissions modes of transportation, like
bicycles, now have several options. You might also wish to think about traveling by
moped or scooter. Riders choose electric scooters over hoverboards mostly because
they are safer and more compact than bikes. Those who are overweight, however,
often worry that this mode of transportation would not be able to carry them. Yet,
there are scooters available for riders who weigh more than 300 pounds, making it
possible for heavier riders as well [46]. Electric motorcycles emit no pollution sim-
ilar to other EVs. Usually, they run on batteries. If renewable energy resources are
used to recharge the batteries, the pollution becomes negligible using this mode of
sustainable transportation [47].
4.4.4
Carpooling
Although not a novel idea, carpooling is nevertheless beneficial and pertinent
today. In short, if you’re all traveling to the same place, you ride together. This
significantly reduces the number of vehicles on the road by reducing traffic and
harmful pollutants. Arizona is one state that has included this approach in its laws
and regulations. There are currently designated lanes that are only used for driving
in carpools. However, if you are caught driving in such lanes alone, you could be
fined heavily. These sustainable transportation solutions are now being adopted by
carshare applications like Lyft and Uber. You can enjoy a less expensive trip by
sharing it with others [46]. These initiatives are useful in motivating people to cul-
tivate greater environmental awareness. The flourishing global economy has con-
tributed to the rise in automobile production. Although many people are thrilled
about this achievement, pollution levels have dramatically risen. Carpooling,
another name for multiple-occupant vehicles, helps to minimize pollution levels
by reducing the number of cars on the road. Vehicles with several occupants are a
72
4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

very beneficial and environmentally friendly form of transportation. When fre-
quently traveling in the same direction, groups of co-workers and friends can share
one vehicle. Using one automobile to transport a number of passengers to their
destination is much more affordable and environmentally sustainable than having
multiple people drive their own vehicles in the same direction. This is undoubtedly
an excellent method to save money and gasoline [47].
4.4.5
Electric Car
In Europe, cars produce 12% of CO2 emissions out of which 73% of emissions are
caused by newly sold cars. Majority of them are company cars. As a result, there
has been a strong push for electric cars future that prevents the use of fossil fuels.
Sales of EVs increased by more than three times in 2020, reaching 10.5% in Europe
[49]. Over the past few years, the number of cars that do not need petrol to run has
increased dramatically. Instead of rushing to gas stations, drivers now plug their
electric cars into charging stations. Using domestic 110 V or 13A plugs at home or
when traveling makes charging these cars pretty simple. Tesla, led by CEO Elon
Musk, is one of the most well-known companies of electric cars to have gained
popularity in the environmentally friendly community. EVs are available for a
reasonable price starting at around $23,000. Overall, this increases the practicality
of broad ownership and may result in lower pollution levels and improved air
quality [46].
Although there are several excellent electric cars available, proper research is
required to select the best one. Also, you need the compatible amenities, which
you may purchase from an EV cable store. Despite the fact that power plants that
generate energy may also release poisonous emissions, electric cars that are totally
powered by electricity do not produce any harmful gases. Even so, renewable
energy sources including hydroelectric, geothermal, wind turbines, and solar
energy can be used to generate power. In comparison with gasoline-fueled conven-
tional cars, electric cars with alternative fuels and cutting-edge vehicle technolo-
gies ease environmental pressure [47]. An electric automobile has a more
environmentally friendly footprint than a thermal car if we compare the two. This
is because clean energy-based electricity is required to operate an electric car. It
also uses rechargeable batteries and an electric motor for propulsion. This indi-
cates that the use of electrical energy to propel the car reduces CO2 emissions from
getting into the atmosphere [48].
4.4.6
Public Transportation
It is obvious that using public transportation has several advantages for the envi-
ronment. Millions of people could avoid using their personal conveyance and take
public transportation, which would significantly reduce the pollution that cities
4.4 Modes of Sustainable Transportation
73

produce. The bus is the best means of transportation for cities, especially hybrid
and battery electric buses. New technologies have made it possible to design
and produce automobiles that emit as little pollution as possible. It is crucial that
public transportation offers a comfortable environment as a part of its high-quality
service, which can encourage more people to adopt it. Hence, it needs to be secure,
efficient, and reliable [48]. Some of the most unique green buses on the market
today are already available. The Mercedes-Benz Ciatro G BlueTec Hybrid Bus,
which makes use of lithium-ion batteries and four-wheel hub motors, is a prime
example. The largest battery in the world is thought to be the lithium-ion one.
Large amounts of energy extracted from a generator (diesel) can be stored in
the battery.
Trains are becoming more environmentally friendly thanks to hybrid electric
locomotives and other cutting-edge green technologies as the majority of govern-
ments throughout the world are now more committed than ever to promoting sus-
tainable transportation. Similar technologies used in hybrid electric cars are also
employed in hybrid electric locomotives. The conductor rail, overhead power
cables, and energy-storage technologies like batteries and fuel cells are all used
by modern electric trains. These electric trains have the advantage of reaching
maximum speeds of greater than 200 mph while retaining high safety levels
[47]. Using public transportation has significant benefits to the environment. Usu-
ally, carpooling and public transportation operate on the same principles. It might
be advantageous to occasionally use the bus or train instead of your car [46].
4.5
Sustainable Transportation in Modern Urban
Advancement
As cities continue to grow and populations increase, the need for sustainable
transportation becomes increasingly vital: the more a city grows, the more
transportation it needs, and the more sustainable transport it needs to provide.
Transportation plays a crucial role in urban advancement, and sustainability is
essential for creating more livable, equitable, and environmentally friendly cities.
This section explores the roles of sustainable transport in urban growth and how it
can contribute to the overall well-being of urban residents.
4.5.1
Importance of Sustainable Transport in Urban Growth
Urban growth is an essential aspect of economic development, but it often comes
at a significant cost to the environment and public health. Nonetheless, sustaina-
ble transport can help cities mitigate the negative impacts of conventional trans-
port systems on the environment by reducing the reliance on private vehicles via
74
4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

promoting alternative, more efficient, modes of transportation. Examples are elec-
tric buses and bicycles that can help reduce congestion and GHG emissions. Sus-
tainable transport also promotes social equity by providing affordable and
accessible transportation options for all members of society, including those
who cannot afford to own a car. Further, it helps improve urban planning to
accommodate novel modes of transport, enable smart cities, and increase eco-
nomic growth.
4.5.1.1
Urban Planning
Given the global drive toward more sustainable transport modes, an efficient dis-
tribution of urban space is paramount in creating feasible transport systems. Thus,
urban planners have a vital role in guaranteeing that cities have sustainable and
equitable transport infrastructures. Sustainable transport necessitates urban plans
that encourage walking, cycling, and other eco-friendly transportation modes
while decreasing reliance on private cars to minimize their negative environmen-
tal effects. Nevertheless, urban space transformation to promote sustainable trans-
port modes has gained widespread attention in the literature, despite its time-
consuming implementation process. Many studies have investigated the effects
of transforming urban spaces in sustainable transport modes such as cycling
and walking [50–52]. A successful example of integrating sustainable transport
and urban planning is the city of Copenhagen in Denmark, where cycling and pub-
lic transportation are given priority. Copenhagen’s commitment to cycling infra-
structure, including dedicated lanes, separated pathways, and secure bike parking,
has resulted in a sustainable urban design that encourages over 60% of inner-city
trips to be made by bicycle, outnumbering cars in the area and improving quality of
life for its residents [53].
4.5.1.2
Smart Cities
Smart cities make use of technology and data to boost sustainability, economic
growth (ecosystem stability), and living standards in urban areas [54]. The key
to building smart cities is sustainable transport, which can be supported by a range
of innovative and modern technologies. Figure 4.3 illustrates some of the key char-
acteristics of sustainable transportation that are directly connected to the develop-
ment and maintenance of smart cities. These features contribute to environmental
stability as well as improving the quality of urban life. The development of sustain-
able transport infrastructure and technology, like EVs and optimized public tran-
sit, can address environmental concerns as well as provide greater connectivity,
which allows people to travel more quickly and efficiently. To create intelligent
solutions for urban areas, it is therefore necessary to establish secure infrastructure
and integrate technology, which enables travelers to stay connected [55]. Sustain-
able transport can provide the residents of smart cities with improved access to
4.5 Sustainable Transportation in Modern Urban Advancement
75

essential services, such as healthcare, education, and employment, all contributing
to the economic growth and development of the city. By creating a more equitable
and accessible transport system, smart cities can promote sustainable and inclu-
sive growth.
4.5.1.3
Economic Growth
Sustainable transport in modern cities can contribute to economic growth and pro-
ductivity by reducing transportation costs and creating job opportunities. In addi-
tion, sustainable transport can attract new investors, businesses, and tourists.
Copenhagen, Denmark, shows best practices for sustainable urban cycling and
bicycle tourism. Approximately 7% of foreign visitors use bicycles while they
are in the city, highlighting the success of this sustainable development [56]. Sus-
tainable infrastructure such as bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and electrified
public transport systems can make it easier and more affordable for people to
access goods and services. This can also increase economic activity. Additionally,
there are many job opportunities that can be created by sustainable transport, such
as in the construction, maintenance, and operation (e.g., food and drink industry)
of transport systems. For example, there are over 35,000 new jobs created in the
United Kingdom due to investments in bike infrastructure and cycle tourism,
showing a remarkable cost-benefit ratio of 13 : 1 [57, 58].
4.5.1.4

In order to ensure sustainable urban development and growth, sustainable trans-
port must be promoted in urban areas. The following are strategies that cities can
use to promote sustainable transport:

4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

• Implementing sustainable urban planning: Urban planners can design cities in
ways that encourage sustainable transport. This means creating mixed-use areas
that reduce the need to travel long distances and promoting local amenities
accessible via public transport, cycling, or walking.
• Investing in public transportation: Public transport is a vital element of sustain-
able transport. It is often cheaper and more efficient than private transportation
and can help reduce congestion. Public transportation can be expanded and
made more accessible to all.
• Encouraging active modes: Active transportation such as walking, or cycling, is
more sustainable and healthier than traditional modes. Building bike lanes and
walking pathways in cities can encourage active transportation.
• Promoting electric vehicles: EVs offer an environmentally friendly alternative to
conventional fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Cities can promote EVs by providing
charging infrastructure and offering incentives, such as tax rebates for EVs and
free parking.
4.6
Infrastructure for Sustainable Transportation
In the context of sustainable development, sustainable transportation improves
the quality, convenience, and livability of the city through constructing a compre-
hensive range of transportation infrastructure services to achieve the objectives of
economic efficiency and sustainability in urban transportation. Several transpor-
tation facilities, such as pathways, cycling routes, trains, buses, and taxi zones
shape the urban transportation environment. Sustainable transportation has been
under continuous development, in both academic and industry sectors, for at least
the last two decades and many of these means are now well established in many
cities around the world. However, electrification has been a game-changing con-
cept in this context.
Transport electrification has been declared as a main strategy to address the
social and political movement to clean energy. Electric buses and scooters have
been introduced to already developed transportation infrastructure. This is,
somehow, the first significant contact between the mobility and electricity
sectors after electrifying the metro and light trains in cities. The massive electri-
fication of transportation requires significant interactions between mobility and
electricity infrastructure.
For example, interaction between electric buses and the power grid, in the form
of charging and possible services, should be well addressed in the transition from
fossil fuel-based buses to EVs. Reliability in providing mobility services is the top
priority of any public transport system. A comprehensive study of mobility
4.6 Infrastructure for Sustainable Transportation
77

demand considering practical constraints such as different driving scenarios,
peak demand, and traffic conditions is required to achieve the energy and fleet
requirements of a reliable electric bus system. For example, electrification of a
bus transport system with 4000 fleet may augment approximately 1.2 gigawatt
hours (GWh) electricity demand to the grid considering a typical electric bus
with a 300 kilowatt hour (kWh) battery capacity. The problem will become more
sophisticated if 175–500 kilowatts (kW) fast chargers are installed to meet tight
bus schedules. That means mobility requirements and power grid constraints
limit each other.
A sustainable transportation system requires a comprehensive integration of
mobility, energy, and social infrastructure, as shown in Figure 4.4. Traditionally,
networks of different means of transport have been designed in most cities such
that an interconnected mobility network has been achieved. Transition toward
e-mobility is probably the main challenge of this sector. This is where the mobility
sector meets the energy sector to facilitate charging of these new mobility means.
Clearly, renewable and clean energy technologies are required to establish a sus-
tainable charging infrastructure. Last, but not least, the social aspect of these tran-
sitions should be well addressed through effective and smooth communication of
benefits of these transition to people.

4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

4.6.1
Governance
Transition to sustainable transportation and keeping it operational in the long
term often requires heavy investment in infrastructure upgrades. Traditionally,
there has been a role-shrinking agreement between the central and local govern-
ments, which has been somehow successful in keeping the infrastructure opera-
tional. However, during transition to sustainable transport, investing in major
infrastructure is likely to be ineffective unless accompanied by local actions and
policies using small-scale investments [59]. In other words, planners and policy-
makers should consider the details on the community scale while they are concur-
rently planning major transportation corridors. There are several stakeholders
when it comes to sustainable transportation including mobility service providers
and information and computer technology (ICT), urban and transport planning
authorities, electricity market operators and aggregators, electric bus, grid, and
charging station operators.
Enhancement of the cooperation among these stakeholders in the context of sus-
tainable transportation is one of the key enablers underpinning a successful tran-
sition and further operation. The complexity is that many of these entities are
working isolated from the others in the current transportation system. Therefore,
the first step is to bring them together and start negotiations between them about
the operation and planning of future transportation. For example, in a 2021 posi-
tion paper, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electric-
ity (ENTSO-E), called on transmission system operators (TSOs) to govern the
optimal transition to EVs [60]. This means that TSOs must look beyond their tra-
ditional responsibilities, get engaged with the mobility sector, and adapt and sup-
port the wider energy system integration.
4.6.2
Interaction with Electricity Infrastructure
There is a significant interest these days to revisit the sustainable transportation
concept in the context of electrification of everything. Many of the transportation
means, from vehicles to bicycles and scooters, are going to be electric. That means
the future sustainable transport system and the power grid, mainly empowered by
renewable energy resources, will be heavily interconnected.
4.6.2.1
Electric Buses and the Power Grid
The capacity of electric bus batteries is normally between 60 and 500 kWh. The size
of the battery is chosen based on the travel distance and travel time of electric
buses in each route. Despite the design process, these buses generally require
on-route fast chargers (up to 500 kW) since their time schedule does not let them
4.6 Infrastructure for Sustainable Transportation
79

leave the service for charging. This is on top of the fast chargers in depots. There-
fore, a significant upgrade of the electricity network is required on the scale of
increasing the capacity of substations and feeders [61]. Practical constraints should
be also considered to address the limitations of the distribution grid where e-
mobility normally connects.
The location and size of charging and battery stations pose significant challenges
for e-mobility. Optimal placement of charging stations is an active field of research
and requires mobility information such as bus routes and schedules. This optimi-
zation sometimes requires smart scheduling algorithms for electric bus deploy-
ment from the depot and main stops as well as for electric bus recharging. On
the other hand, network operators are mainly concerned with the capital costs
of installing a fast charger or a depot. Unpredictable and intermittent electric
bus charging is another challenge. Any charging activity should be well aligned
with the peak time of the energy demand. Optimal daytime charging could be
helpful in spreading the load.
4.6.2.2
Operational Strategies
Operational strategies identify the time and duration of operation, sleep, and char-
ging of a transportation means based on the required mobility service. For exam-
ple, most of the transportation means are normally in the stations during night-
time; thus, night-time charging could be the first option. However, it does not line
up with solar generation times and is often aligned with electricity network peaks.
New charging strategies that maximize renewable energy storage are required.
These strategies should utilize the flexibility of each mobility service to manage
green charging. For example, opportunity on-route chargers can be supplied by
solar if appropriate storage systems are used. Another challenge is the small-
energy capacity of EVs compared to fossil fuel-based cars [62]. That means at least
for short-term planning, electric buses with large and heavy storage systems
should be considered. This adds operational limitations when it comes to challeng-
ing conditions, such as hilly routes.
4.6.2.3
Compensation for the Minimum Demand Reduction
As the use of distributed energy resources like solar rooftop photovoltaic and bat-
tery storage systems increases, it becomes challenging to maintain a minimum
operational demand for the grid [63]. This can impact grid security and reliability.
To address this, network operators can implement several strategies such as using
storage systems to absorb excess solar generation, curtailing photovoltaic systems
during emergencies, and encouraging e-mobility charging during low-mobility
demand periods. These strategies can help to increase the minimum operational
demand and ensure that EVs charge from clean energy. However, it is crucial for
80
4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

network operators to carefully balance the integration of distributed energy
resources with grid reliability and security.
4.6.2.4
Flexible Operation of E-mobility
The demand for electricity and transportation systems peaks at different times,
presenting an opportunity to integrate sustainable transportation systems flexibly
into the grid. For instance, during the early evening peak in electricity demand,
transportation systems slow down, while the opposite happens during peak day-
time mobility demand. Integrating sustainable transportation systems can align
the fleet’s electricity demand with the daily electricity demand profile.
Sustainable transportation planning, such as dynamic route assignment, can
also increase flexibility in the transportation system. This can reduce the number
of fleet vehicles required and increase the utilization of purchased vehicles, par-
ticularly for electric buses. Such planning can help align the electricity demand
profile with the transportation system, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient
use of resources.
4.6.3
Features of Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks
For a long time, several transportation networks have been implemented and run,
sometimes by different operators, in a city. The main focus of the network
designers has been either on vehicles or on individual network design and optimi-
zation [64]. For example, the planning concerns of bus-operating companies and
city transport service operators have been limited to bus networks in order to
improve the network configuration [65], optimize the number of fleets through
dynamic bus routing [66, 67], or reduce passenger waiting time [68]. The same sce-
nario happens for other transportation means such as trains and trams. However,
in the context of integrated transportation, these networks are identified as funda-
mental subsystems that need to work collaboratively.
The problem of integrated transportation system brings up the spatial distribu-
tion of transportation services as a measure for urban development [69]. The main
idea is to guarantee fair accessibility of all urban services, such as education,
entertainment, and health, using the transportation system. As a part of the urban
management system hierarchy, integrated transport can be managed through
hierarchical approaches such as the demand-responsive transit proposed in Ref.
[70]. In fact, the problem of integrated transportation planning should be
addressed in a layer of the comprehensive, urban planning framework. In this con-
text, some transportation links need improvement, some of them can be removed,
while new links should be also defined.
Designing an integrated transportation system in the context of comprehensive
urban planning is indeed a large-scale optimization problem. It requires location
4.6 Infrastructure for Sustainable Transportation
81

models for city facilities and can be formulated as either a continuous or discrete
optimization problem [71]. A wide range of objective functions can be considered
from minimizing the cost of construction of new links to minimizing the travel
time between two specific centers [72]. This sophisticated network optimization
problem requires advanced methods to solve such as mathematical graph
theory [73].
4.6.3.1
Transport Resilience and Sustainability
As cities become more complex in terms of social relations, population, and infra-
structure, they become more vulnerable to failures and poor management. Several
uncertain factors, such as political instability and cyberattacks, may also happen in
this interconnected infrastructure. In addition, new disruptive technologies are
emerging in our daily lifestyle, which are sometimes out of the direct control of
planners and urban managers. For example, the emergence of EVs impacts the
stability of the power distribution grid in a city since unexpected EV charging
may happen anywhere at any time.
Resilience of a transportation system can be studied either from the supply-side,
i.e., the system planners and operators, or from the customer-side [74]. The focus
on the supply side is to recover the quality of service as fast as possible after the
failure or attack. It may include different strategies such as establishing redundan-
cies in the system, shifting between different transportation modes, and repair of
critical inputs. On the customer-side, the focus is on running the life or business
activities as usual using the remained and healthy transport services. Social reac-
tions from the customers may also impact transportation. Studies show a signifi-
cant reduction in the number of passengers in the United Kingdom and the United
States after unexpected serious incidents [75]. This puts the transport system under
financial pressure.
While transport resilience focuses on fast system recovery after unexpected
events, transport sustainability always looks for socioeconomic equilibrium, i.e.,
self-sufficiency, as well as ecologically viable solutions with minimum environ-
mental impact. An integrated sustainable transport system should have close
interaction and co-evolution with other urban subsystems to contribute to the
whole urban management system without compromising other city services.
Although resilience and sustainability seem to be totally different concepts, the
contrast is not clear in the research environment [76].
The interconnection between transport resilience and sustainability can be
shown using Figure 4.5 proposed in Ref. [76]. In fact, the performance of any
large-scale hierarchical system can be studied through a bottom-up or top-down
approach. The former is more subjective, called active, while the latter is more sub-
jective and passive. Also, the transport development activities can be more formal
(rational) than informal. Figure 4.5 shows how the resilience and sustainability of
82
4 Urban Integrated Sustainable Transportation Networks

transportation can be distinguished considering these concepts. For example, it
shows that active and rational approaches result in sustainable transport while
passive-rational is related to resilience. Therefore, resilience and sustainability
of the transport system are not necessarily aligned to each other.
In addition to transportation means and networks, other aspects related to them,
such as stations, should be considered in an integrated sustainable transport sys-
tem. For example, the land use planning problem has been addressed in Ref. [77]
to sustainably use the area around a transport station in Beijing, China. This is
indeed a multi-objective optimization problem including different features such
as density and cultural diversity of the area, accessibility, and environmental
impact. In addition to technical complexity, there are several regulation and leg-
islation challenges. For example, a study in the United Kingdom shows how con-
flict of responsibilities, such as duplication of procedures, may cause failure in
integrating the transportation system sustainably.
4.6.4
Transition to a Sustainable Transportation
Transition from the current unsustainable transportation to a sustainable one is a
complicated socio-technical problem [78]. Governance, financing, infrastructure,
and neighborhoods are the four pillars identified for this transition [59].

4.6 Infrastructure for Sustainable Transportation
83

A successful transition requires an interdisciplinary major activity to cover all
these four pillars simultaneously. For example, an ASI approach is proposed in
Ref. [79] to overcome the encountered barriers in transition to sustainable trans-
portation. The first step in this approach is to “avoid” unnecessary traveling
demand by implementing smart city planning. This can be done by reducing
the distance between residential locations and places of daily activities or priori-
tizing local pedestrians or cyclers. “Shifting” the traveling demand from personal
vehicles to public transport is a popular approach toward clean transportation.
Finally, the infrastructure related to clean transportation, such as EV charging
and intelligent transport facilities, should be “improved”. Another example in
the Mexican bajío shows how the lack of social support can hinder the integration
of a 115 M pesos cycling infrastructure project into daily lives [80].
In late 2021, the United States announced a $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to boost three key areas of transport electrification. The
first one, called connectivity, funds highways, roads, and bridges, and invests in
public transit and water system upgrades, passenger rail, airports, supply chain
ports, and high-quality broadband connectivity [81]. Secondly, the decarboniza-
tion part supports the expansion of renewable energy, EV adoption, and emerging
technologies such as energy storage, blue hydrogen, geothermal, and advanced
nuclear power generation. Finally, the Act supports the workforce by creating
1.5 million jobs per year for the next 10 years [82]. All these areas should progress
simultaneously to achieve sustainable green transportation.
4.7
Conclusion
This chapter presents an overview of various aspects of sustainable transportation.
It encompasses different perspectives from cogent reasoning for the adoption of
sustainable transportation modes to the infrastructure requirements for its well-
planned implementation on a global scale. It also provides a deep insight into
the existing challenges for the transition from the conventional fossil fuel-based
transportation system toward the clean, secure, reliable, and healthy modes of sus-
tainable transportation. It also throws some light on the key benefits in terms of
social and economic views of shifting to these modes. It also highlights the core
issues in planning for the establishment of proper infrastructure that can meet
the increasing demand for mobility. This chapter is quite beneficial for academic
researchers and industrial workers to be aware of the intensity of the existing cli-
mate crisis in which the conventional fuel-based transportation system plays a sig-
nificant role. Moreover, it elaborates on the systematic ways to not only improve
the current situation of the transportation sector but also plan for future policies to
successfully achieve green economy and sustainable development. In view of the

Introduction
Because of urban growth over the last few years, the proportion of the world inha-
bitants of cities has risen from 39% in 1970 to 60% in 2022 [1]. The number of
licensed automobiles has risen from 200 million in 1960 to 1431 million in 2018. This
is due to the expanding population and financial progress, as well as the high
requirement of the millennial population for a customized transportation [2].
The existing transportation found a significant positive to make it possible for people
to transit to their normal tasks, improve the energy efficiency of transportation
services, and reduce the detrimental effects of road transport on the environment,
climatic conditions, and health impacts. In addition, sustainable development
is described as addressing present needs without compromising those of the
future [3]. In the same vein, it is possible to define sustainable transportation as
the capacity to meet the accessibility needs of the modern society, while minimizing
environmental pollution and preserving the movement of future generations [4].
The different pollution attributes include other harmful emissions in addition to
greenhouse gases (GHG), so even the future system with the minimum GHG emis-
sions might not be able to address possible environmental issues [5]. An alternative
approach would be to look for new types of fuel for the transportation system [6].
By minimizing carbon pollution and implementing low-carbon systems through-
out their life cycle, low-carbon transit infrastructure can be attained. The key

technologies typically cover every stage of a transportation infrastructure’s life cycle,
including the manufacturing of raw materials, the building of the facilities, the
maintenance and operation phases, and the end-of-life phases [7]. The automobile
industry is at a turning point as a result of the emergence of these new innovations
and the growing accessibility of renewable energies. Modern transportation net-
works are anticipated to be more connected with industrial automation, the energy
infrastructure, and information ecosystems even while the techniques and energies
that will carry people and commodities are yet unknown. This offers never-before-
seen chances to make use of these links and achieve system-level ideal results [8].
Technologies that combine transportation and energy by taking into consideration
shifts in the demand for transportation and mobility, the usage of fuel and energy, as
well as the effects of actions and regulations, modeling tools may help explain the
shift to this future. Understanding the linkages between various systems, the effects
of technology and innovative mobility marketing strategies, and the infrastructure
required to accommodate changes in the way cars are fueled will be crucial for mod-
eling future mobility and energy systems. A more in-depth comprehension of the
spatiotemporal energy usage needs that are unrelated to the existing systems will
be necessary, in particular, to investigate the function of alternative fuels [9]. Utili-
zation of renewable energy and effective resource use is necessary for green trans-
portation. The transportation sector might become carbon neutral through
conserving energy and reducing emissions in addition to embracing renewable
energy, which is the primary option. According to our estimates, the transportation
sector’s carbon emissions will reach their high in 2030 at 1.33 billion tonnes before
falling to 77% from 1.16 billion tonnes in 2019 to 261 million tonnes in 2060 [10].
In conclusion, to the best of their understanding, studies on multi-energy tech-
nologies that incorporate green and integrated transportation networks are sparse,
but a collaboration of electrical grids, heat power, and energy for transportation
might capitalize on the benefits of multi-energy sources. More research is needed
to completely understand the ideal design and operation of multi-energy systems
that can improve efficiency, flexibility, and carbon footprint. Although resilience
has been extensively explored in the literature, outage survival difficulties neces-
sitate more research for a thorough understanding of resilience, particularly in
multi-energy technologies in the transportation industry. The situation has an
impact on every kind of transportation, including cars driven by individuals, city
buses, trains, and aeroplanes. It is the moment to consider economic and technical
advancements in order to improve the transportation infrastructure. Researchers
desperately require clarifying the system and defining GT after taking into account
the seriousness of the issue related to the overall transportation system. This chap-
ter is organized into eight sections. Section 5.1 is introductory. Section 5.2 presents
the definition of green transportation. Section 5.3 presents the technological devel-
opment and managerial integration for green transportation. It includes a smart

transportation network, resource-efficient technologies, green technology, hybrid
systems, and integrated management for green transportation. Section 5.4
describes the definition and features of an integrated multi-energy system. It com-
prises major characteristics of an integrated multi-energy system. Section 5.5 pre-
sents the electric vehicle integration with renewable energy sources. Section 5.6
describes hybrid fuel cell/battery vehicle systems. Section 5.7 presents the barriers
and challenges of integrated multi-energy systems. Finally, Section 5.8 sum-
marizes the conclusions and discusses the scope for future research.
5.2
Definition of Green Transportation
Transportation has a benefit of the societal economic, sociological, and environ-
mental footprint. Transportation should be prioritized in order to meet urban sus-
tainability objectives; this may be accomplished by regulating various components
of the transportation network (public transportation), automobile developmental
stages, and effective resource patterns [11]. GT is described as “transportation that
has less negative effects on human health and the environment than present trans-
portation services” [12]. GT may be defined as a hybrid technology that combines
the optimum use of conventional fuels, the most effective use of electric car sys-
tems, the utilization of bioenergy as a fuel for automobiles, and improved public
transit [13]. Lower risk, reduced traffic issues, enhanced energy and resource sus-
tainability, reduced emissions, and improved assurance of safety are all benefits of
a functional GT system. The goal of smart, green, and integrated transportation is
to increase the competitiveness of the transportation sectors and develop a
resource-efficient, environment and eco-friendly, stable, and fully integrated
transportation system for the benefit of the public, the economy, and society
[14]. The interconnections between different resource consumption in the urban
agricultural system and the GT system, together with the sustainability features of
smart hybrid vehicles, have emerged as a new research area of focus in a food-
energy-water nexus [15].
5.3
Technological Development and Managerial
Integration for Green Transportation
Transportation agencies are under intense pressure to adjust to changing needs
and declining income in this era of globalization and the green frontier. Although
adaptable, transportation’s influence on the environment is heavily reliant on
transportation technology to be lessened. In the current situation, agencies look
for innovative ways to increase the productivity of their current resources so they
94
5 Multi-Energy Technologies in Green and Integrated Transportation Networks

can provide the public with delightful travel opportunities. There are various tech-
nologies that can help the development of GT [16].
5.3.1
Energy-Efficient Technology
The re-design concept is the basis of energy-efficient technologies. Its fascinating
to observe that as time goes on, manufacturers are shifting away from enhancing
certain parts of cars and toward fully revamping them to achieve improved energy
efficiency [17]. To increase energy efficiency, hybrid combustion technology is
being used. Friction also results in the loss of 10–15% of the energy produced
by an automobile’s IC engine. The performance of an engine may be improved
by using lubricants to reduce this drag. To increase energy efficiency, several
research facilities are creating brand-new nanofluids or lubricants that might
address this frictional problem. Hybrid technologies might be a dependable solu-
tion to improve the efficiency of a combustion engine. In order to increase the effi-
ciency of combustion engines, fuel is also essential [18]. Hydrogen fuel cells are
another good alternative energy option in combination with bioenergy [19].
5.3.2
Eco-Friendly Technology
Numerous technical advancements, including lighter vehicles, eco-friendly ele-
ments and manufacturing techniques, lower friction coefficient, and better trans-
missions, can increase the performance of the vehicle [5]. Green resources have
been used in operation with a noticeable decrease in GHG emissions without com-
promising safety. In general, a vehicle’s weight may be decreased to minimize
energy consumption. According to a basic rule of thumb, a 10% decrease in gross
weight can minimize energy consumption by 5–7% when combined with good
engine technology. BMW’s new all-electric compact car, the Intel Xeon, which
is constructed from reinforced carbon fiber to save its weight by 30–50% compared
to steel, is one such example [20].
5.3.3
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)
Because of the emergence of innovative technologies including hardware and soft-
ware systems, navigation technologies, smart sensors, communications, cloud
computing, virtual operations, and planning approaches in recent decades, the
condition of the transportation network has completely altered. Traffic monitor-
ing, cargo monitoring, systems integration, emergency logistics system, and con-
sumer management platform are important intelligent transportation system (ITS)
components. Numerous IT technologies may contribute significantly to risk mit-
igation, current traffic abatement, and reduced environmental impact along with
improved associated with vehicle flow to provide an enjoyable ride for all

modalities. Some of them integrate automated toll collecting, data gathering from
highways, transportation management systems, automotive information gather-
ing, transit signal priorities, and other technologies [21]. The following are some
examples of ITS advances that may be seen in electric vehicles:
Automated vehicles – These vehicles can operate themselves by using advanced
sensors and a customized transport network. If the technology is suitable to
travel on challenging routes, these are safer [22].
Smart roads can detect how many tyres are being driven on them and provide
information to drivers about transportation systems so that they can plan their
journey appropriately [23].
Biometric vehicle access–With the use of these technologies, users of vehicles
may start and access them using their eyes or biometrics. However, compared
to optic scanners, biometric scanners have a higher chance of being accepted [24].
Remote vehicle shutoff is a feature that has been added to cell phones to stop
thievery. The use of these technologies can disable stolen autos. By 2020, this
remote vehicle shut-down technology is anticipated to be used [25].
Vehicle-to-vehicle communication (peloton technologies) – Fuel and safety
are two major issues that the transportation sector faces. To improve safety and
save power, large vehicles are connected by peloton, vehicle-to-vehicle connec-
tions, and sensor automatic safety systems. For the second vehicle and 4.5% for
the main vehicle, fuel savings are anticipated to total 10% [20]
The electronic toll collection system (ETC) is designed to reduce wait times at
toll booths. The ETC system is designed to automatically deduct money from
authorized automobile users’ account while forcing them to end. Taiwan
was the first nation in the world to implement electronic tolls on all of its
highways [26].
5.3.4
Integrating Systems: Efficiency by Design
High-strength iron, optical fiber composites, metal matrix composites, advanced
composite matrix, and magnesium composites may reduce weight by 10–28%,
15–25%, 30–60%, 50–70%, and 30–70%, respectively, during the design process
of vehicles. In terms of internal components, strong insulation provides for a
concentration drop of 0.4 kg, polyamide polymers at the rear seat, chassis, and con-
toured light panel decrease weight by 0.3 kg, 0.7 kg, and 0.4 kg, respectively, with-
out sacrificing durability and stability, and traditional combination and insert
hybrid automobiles have their own designs. However, a normal hybrid has to have
its gas tank filled periodically, necessitating many trips to the gas station. Addition-
ally, it features a power pack that may be used to power the vehicle or launch it.
Fuel is the main source of energy. A battery serves as the plug-in hybrid vehicle’s
primary fuel source, with petrol serving as a backup. The plug-in hybrid
96
5 Multi-Energy Technologies in Green and Integrated Transportation Networks

technology is more user-friendly when compared to the other two since it can be
fueled at home and does not need to be refilled [27]. The British automobile sci-
entist remarked on the logicalness of the race vehicle design, but his ideas apply to
many cutting-edge ways of dealing with energy efficiency, such as replacing steel
with lightweight materials [28].
5.3.5
Energy Re-using
With this technique, it is anticipated that less fuel will be used and more air will be
used. The energy generated during a vehicle’s break may be recovered and used
again using kinetic energy restoration technologies. For use later, while accelerat-
ing, the enhanced energy is typically stored in a reservoir. Multiple applications,
including racing automobiles and passenger vehicles, have made use of it.
5.3.6
Solar Impulse Technology
An electric vehicle that uses solar energy as its energy is referred to as a solar car.
Photovoltaic systems are used to turn solar energy into electrical energy. With sun-
rise, the first solar-powered flight took off in 1974 [29]. By completing the first
round-the-world voyage powered entirely by solar energy in July 2016, ABB alli-
ance partner Solar Impulse made history. For the use of solar energy for public
transport services in 2020, the Tube Way Solar Company has created a solar cargo
bike and tube way system [30]. The advantage of Solar Impulse Technology goes
beyond sustainability and offers management over the continuously growing cost
of electricity.
5.3.7
Integrated Management for Green Transportation
In order to maintain development in the economy, the ecological, and safety, the
transportation sector modifies how it is structured and controlled. It is challenging
to tackle the problem of urbanization and transportation, and any attempt to
achieve sustainability in the transportation network needs to take into account
all the many facets of travel demands. The main factor consists of land use effi-
ciency, traffic control, emissions rates, and vehicle growth patterns. Since each
of these factors affects the others, it can be challenging to address any one of them
on its own. Consequently, it is crucial to address them at the stage of integration
[31]. The five key components of the integrated management framework for the
GT are benchmark assessment, target formulation, governmental pledges, execu-
tion and monitoring, and assessment and adaptation. These five components are
schematically shown in Figure 5.1. GT can be effectively applied in several inte-
grated management industries.

5.3.7.1
Infrastructure Development
In the automotive industry, maintaining the network is a significant difficulty for
many emerging regions since it not only takes a significant financial investment
but also calls for the right operational and technological abilities. To transform the
cityscape and public domain, significant spending on infrastructure for walkers
and bicycles is needed. Additional management strategies include carbon restric-
tion, geological formations expanded vehicular access, vehicular traffic regulation,
restrictions on automobile parking and accessibility, lowered speed restrictions,
and behavioral modification strategies.
5.3.7.2
Alternative Measures in Urban Transportation
The following are alternate energy sources, managerial strategies, and technolog-
ical advancements to consider for the world’s public transportation system:
To encourage the use of natural gas vehicles, such as petroleum products, as an
alternative to fossil fuels, such as hydrocarbons, coal, and petroleum; raising
public awareness of the benefits of using electric vehicles; to grant hybrid elec-
tric automobiles a tax break; to encourage research toward the creation of fuel-
cell automobiles; creating a safer hydrogen energy source; creating a tax relief
policy to encourage the use of biofuels; developing an inspection and mainte-
nance strategy for an environmental certification scheme; developing and
deploying emission control technologies; building bypasses and signals to
improve traffic management; and promoting the use of metro rail and monorail
travel.
5.4
Definition and Features of Integrated
Multi-Energy System
5.4.1
Definition of Integrated Multi-Energy System
Energy systems integration (ESI) is the method of integrating the operations and
management of energy technologies across several geographic regions and/or
channels to supply dependable, affordable energy services with low environmental
impact. Energy system interactions (ESI) involve connections between energy
sources (power, heat, and fuel) as well as interconnections with other large-scale
applications such as irrigation, transportation, and communications systems con-
stitute an underlying technology for ESI [31]. The structural, organizational, and
geographical interactions are where ESI is most useful since there are new possi-
bilities and difficulties for development, implementation, and application that can
lead to economic and social advantages. ESI is a multidimensional field that
5.4 Definition and Features of Integrated Multi-Energy System
99

includes human behavior as well as science, engineering, and technology [32].
Compared to “traditional” energy technologies, which respect the multiple energy
segments “individually” multi-energy systems (MES), where power generation,
refrigeration, fuel sources, and transport interact efficiently at different levels, have
a significant chance to enhance technical, economic, and involve performing [33].
The concentration on both broadness and depth at the same time is what makes ESI
such a difficult and fascinating field. Through plug-in electric (hybrid) cars and car
battery packs, the hitherto completely independent domains of transportation and
power may become increasingly connected. However, the customer must embrace
this method of transportation [34]. Enhance the energy system’s adaptability, for
example, by enabling electrically powered heating and cooling loads to naturally
possess storage properties to contribute to power source balancing by offering
reserve and performance requirements, or by utilizing the adaptable storage
technologies found in electric vehicles (EVs) to endorse wind connectivity while
supplying cleaner energy for transportation [35].
5.4.2
Major Characteristics of Integrated Multi-Energy System
To emphasize the variety of views and diversity that often constitute MES, four
sequences of classification will be carefully pursued. They are as follows [36]:
The geographical viewpoint is used to illustrate whether MES might be meant the-
oretically or at various degrees of grouping in terms of its constituents. Buildings
may be the first level of grouping (where, for example, multiple technology
classes providing multiple energy channels combine with one another), followed
by districts (such as the critically essential situations of district energy technol-
ogies), and eventually, territories and even continents.
The objective of the multi-service viewpoint is on delivering several functions or
“outcomes” (from multiple forms of energy utilities to the transportation industry)
by integrating energy pathways as best as possible, especially at the level of pro-
duction. A situation that is especially pertinent is the one involving the joint cre-
ation of many fuel sources. The multi-fuel approach emphasizes how various
sources of energy, from “traditional” fossil fuels to biomass resources and renew-
able energy sources (RES) for electric and thermal energy, can be incorporated
together to meet the best availability of the multi-service consumption in an
MES (commonly for both environmental and economic benefits). The channel
characteristics discusses the vital function that energy networks play in the evolu-
tion of multi-energy systems and how they engage to reduce system costs and max-
imize sustainability impact. These channels include those for energy, fuel, district
heating and cooling, hydrogen, and other types of energy.

5 Multi-Energy Technologies in Green and Integrated Transportation Networks

A balanced allocation, integrated control, and functional management of mul-
tiple energy sources comprise integrated multi-energy. It is an optimization issue
with several activities and multiple constraints, thus during the application proce-
dure, special attention should indeed be paid to the requirements indicated below
[37]: (i) the availability of resources to meet the integrated multi-energy system’s
demand for energy forms. Integrated multi-energy systems must take into account
all available recourses and be tailored to the area’s specific needs. In order to satisfy
the need for energy supply, it needs to rationally embrace energy of diverse forms
to create combinations that integrate one another. (ii) The potential for different
energy levels to interact, integrate, and support one another. The energy streams
on the side of the power sources are interchangeable in certain respects in inte-
grated multi-energy. Technically, integrated multi-energy cannot be realized if
two sources of energy cannot be replaced. (iii) Integrated multi-energy can provide
the load requirement in a cohesive manner. Based on load requirements, inte-
grated multi-energy implementation should be carried out. The layout of energy
demand is estimated directly by the load profile. Commercial, domestic, and pro-
fessional energy usage will all be very different in terms of proportion and features.
The user load demand for power, heating, and cooling varies with seasonal and
demographic shifts. Various working modes can be made synchronized by the
integrated multi-energy. (iv) The use of pertinent technological advancements that
can facilitate integrated multi-energy. The intricacy of the global energy system is
increased by integrated multi-energy. Due to the intimate coupling between the
elements, problems such as malfunctioning and disruption can propagate
throughout the subsystems and have an influence on each other. The resilience
and reliability of the system are ensured by the energy infrastructure technologies
that facilitate the deployment of integrated multi-energy, such as technological
integrating, control and monitoring, dispatch planning,and information proces-
sing. (v) The business strategy and operational services may satisfy the needs of
an integrated multi-energy activity. Users of the integrated multi-energy can flex-
ibly shift between a variety of energy sources, including power, gasoline, coal, and
natural gas. It is time for traditionally grown service providers to become multi-
energy providers. As the use of an integrated multi-energy system develops, so
should the operating framework, market process, oversight methods, commercial
model, and access requirements.
5.4.3
Role and Effects of Multi-Energy Conversion Systems in Green
and Integrated Transportation Networks
Ever-rising CO2 emissions from transport are a challenge that no one technology
can address alone. Here, a comprehensive strategy for integrating transport into
energy planning is put out, employing a variety of strategies to promote
5.4 Definition and Features of Integrated Multi-Energy System

sustainable travel. It is stated that while a 100% renewable energy transportation
system is feasible, getting there will include major obstacles. Because biomass is a
finite resource, itscritical to prevent any impact on the food supply. A multifaceted
approach and the integration of the transportation and energy systems are essen-
tial. The long-term objective must be taken into account in short-term solutions.
Biofuels are the major focus of the growing global attention on the transporta-
tion industry. However, because biomass is a finite resource, it cannot provide a
viable mode of transportation by itself. Biofuels will affect food production if used
without restriction. Biofuels for transport have a significant role in the long-term
planning for 100% renewable energy sources when combined with other equally
essential technologies and ideas [38].
About 25% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the transpor-
tation industry. Fossil fuels predominate, which has a variety of detrimental effects
on both people and the environment. Research in alternative automobile engines,
such as various electric car models and low-carbon fuels, has grown over the past
several years. Fuel cell transportation is a unique subset of electric vehicles. In
such automobiles, hydrogen is refueled, preserved, and then utilized to generate
power on board rather than charging batteries at charging points. Similar to elec-
tricity, hydrogen is a secondary energy carrier that may be created from a variety of
main energy sources, such as fossil fuels and renewable energy. Green hydrogen is
the common name for hydrogen produced using renewable energy sources. How-
ever, high ecological sustainability is taking precedence if hydrogen is to be
regarded as a source of energy for usage in the transportation industry.
5.5
Electric Vehicle Integration with Renewable
Energy Sources
Due to their minimal carbon pollution and reduced dependency on oil, electric
vehicles (EVs) have gained a considerable degree of mainstream adoption during
the past 10 years. According to the estimates, there will be more than 36 million
EVs worldwide by 2023. However, a significant issue with EVs is that they have a
significant adoption rate, which increases terminal and substation traffic and the
local grid’s excessive energy usage. Integrating energy production, such as RESs,
into the EV charging network is one effective way to mitigate the impact [39–42].
High standards for system reliability and relative power regulation have been
prompted by the increasing generation capacity of solar and wind power in many
places [43, 44]. Its significant that the investigation has mostly concentrated on
the possible impact of EVs in easing the integration of RESs in the electricity grid.
The research topic, which is focused on how EVs may create reciprocal advantages
102
5 Multi-Energy Technologies in Green and Integrated Transportation Networks

for the electric energy system with RES and prospective EV consumers, has been
created within the context of the smart grid [45]. In particular, the study has
concentrated on EV-based approaches for providing additional benefits for wind
integration and power storage for PV integration.
5.5.1
Electric Vehicle Integration with Wind Energy
According to the reports, integrating wind energy and electric vehicles into elec-
tricity grids makes sense for the delivery of auxiliary functions [46]. EVs should
indeed be synchronized for elevated activities, especially supplementary services
that frequently lower the operational cost to EV users in the shortterm [47]. Even
though EVs have a greater beginning value than ICE vehicles, EV users are
expected to pay less overall. The advantages of auxiliary benefits rendered by
EVs in the power grid [48]. Their primary focus was on the management of sec-
ondary reserves and load frequency control, which is evaluated using computa-
tional methods. The article describes that EVs may effectively manage energy
imbalance brought on by wind power’s fluctuation, doing away with the need
for traditional power stations. Huge numbers of distributed EVs and home appli-
ances may be leveraged to provide LFC as secondary reserves in the electric grid.
According to the simulation’s findings, it can be shown that battery packs experi-
ence significant energy excursions that often switch between an empty and full
level of charge [49]. It is thought that increasing the objective of voltage regulation
in Denmark is unavoidably necessary in order to decrease the unnecessary use of
automated reserves [50] and to re-establish their supply. The authors claim that
one of the best alternatives for the future replacement of the diminished reserve
capacity produced by traditional power plants is employing EVs to provide mea-
suring energy in Denmark. The study examined micro-grid uses as well. Lopes
et al. address the application of EV demand management and a droop manage-
ment approach to stabilize the synchronism in a micro-grid with wind energy
in Ref. [51]. It was shown that by utilizing a synchronized EV demand, the degree
of penetration of wind energy may be raised even further. In a previous study,
power grids and EVs were thought to be ideal controlled loads in a network sim-
ulator, but the study neglected to consider potential obstacles such as the need for
EV management and the behavior of EV parts during synchronization times.
5.5.2
Electric Vehicle Integration with Solar Energy
In contrast to other studies concentrating on wind power and EVs, the study on the
use of solar energy with EVs is substantially more diverse. Significantly, PV elec-
tricity production is feasible inside the power system networks at both moderate
and low-voltage levels. Moreover, this option further encourages the idea of com-
bining PV energy with EVs [52]. Furthermore, studies show that solar energy may
5.5 Electric Vehicle Integration with Renewable Energy Sources
103

be conveniently conserved in automobile battery packs for later use throughout
the day, when radiation from the sun is at its strongest. The concept of “green”-
charging [53], for example, is one addition that has helped users grasp the neces-
sity of limiting the pricing of EVs during the irradiation duration. It is proposed the
idea that EVs may be fueled on a daily basis in parking spaces located, for example,
inside companies. In order to implement the solar-to-vehicle (SV2) technique, EVs
may also be fully recharged during business hours. The study also shows that
energy produced in each parking space is crucial for the additional generation
of enough electricity to meet the needs of EV operators for mobility [54].
Despite the possibility of substantial PV power system adoption, lower voltage is
also a possibility. The main restriction under such circumstances is related to fluc-
tuations in voltage measurement along the sources. Additionally, these differences
are especially noticeable at times of high output and low demand [55]. Conse-
quently, these occurrences are expected to happen frequently, but mostly in loca-
tions where there are a lot of homes with roof-mounted solar panels. On the other
hand, several investigations have looked at different options for reducing voltage
capability, including grid strengthening, voltage regulation strategies [56], harmo-
nized power flow restriction, and long-term energy storage [57]. Research reveals
that the synchronized EV load inside the feeders employing high PV adoption has
not been adequately evaluated.
5.6
Hybrid Fuel Cell/Battery Vehicle Systems
New varieties of fuel cell vehicles have been made available for purchase for mul-
tiple transportation needs. Cars, buses, submarines, and motorbikes are a few
examples of common applications. Due to its relative high maturity, impressive
performance, and quick reaction, proton exchange membrane fuel cells
(PEMFC) are the fuel source of choice for the majority of applications. The major-
ity of the energy needed to run the vehicle is produced by the PEMFC stacks when
hydrogen is utilized as the fuel. In order to achieve a quick reaction to sudden
acceleration or deceleration, a power supply is included. Alternative energy
sources for fuel cell cars include methanol, ethanol, gasoline, etc., however, they
require additional fuel processing components like reformers or partial oxidation
reactors (POX) and water-gas shift reactors. The preferred operating temperature
for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is normally between 600 C and 1000 C. Due to
this, balance of plant is more complicated and SOFC is less adaptable in terms
of reboot and energy management. However, an automobile normally needs a
power output of 100 kW. SOFC has the edge in terms of efficiency at this size
[58]. This SOFC-based power generation has the unique characteristic that the
104
5 Multi-Energy Technologies in Green and Integrated Transportation Networks
.

SOFC stack feeds the power pack instead of directly powering the motor. Users can
therefore receive a driving dynamic that is comparable to that of a fully electric car.
A typical PEMFC-based electric vehicle system is shown in Figure 5.2.
5.6.1
PEMFC-Based Fuel Cell Vehicle Systems
Although it is commonly accepted that hydrogen is the end objective for fuel cell
vehicles, there continues to be disagreement over how to use it. Even though it will
cost more to build refueling stations and store hydrogen, internal compressed
hydrogen storage can streamline the fuel cell car system. Figure 5.3a–c displays
the system schematics for these three fuel cell cars. These systems attempted to
power a midsize automobile car similar to the partnership for a new generation
of vehicles (PNGV) with less weight, rolling resistance, and aerodynamic drag [60].
To simulate these three systems, Ogden created a numerical simulation model
that included a dynamic PEMFC model, a steam reformer, a POX reactor, a WGS
reactor, and a selective catalytic oxidation (SCO) reactor. The power battery can
supply additional required power when the fuel cell is unable to run the motor
by itself. According to the premise that the battery should be kept close to an

optimal state of charge, this system will distribute the power demand between the
fuel cell and the battery (SOC). According to the PEMFC stack’s polarization curve
and the efficiency of the fuel processing subsystem, this model determined the
amount of fuel that was used. The anode of the PEMFC stack was supplied with
pure H2 for the hydrogen-fueled system. However, whether the system is powered
by methanol or gasoline, the incoming H2 concentration depends on the fuel pro-
cessing subsystem’s output. For methanol-fueled systems, the intake H2 level is
around 75%, whereas for gasoline-fueled systems, it is 40%. Fuels that are liquid
at room temperature and normal pressure, such as methanol and gasoline, have
a greater volumetric energy density. Hydrocarbon-fueled systems need more fuel
reformers, POX reactors, WGS reactors, SCO reactors, and other BOPs such as heat
exchangers, burners, compressors, and turbines than H2-fueled systems need. This
mechanism is substantially more intricate as a result. The combined peak power of
the power battery pack and PEMFC stack in these three fuel cell vehicle systems is
closed. Because they are lightweight, hydrogen-fueled systems require the least
peak power. In these unique circumstances, the power battery was employed to
provide the additional power requirements. The expenses of the fuel processing
subsystems for methanol- and gasoline-fueled systems are comparable. The

was largely responsible for the high investment costs for the gasoline-fueled fuel
cell vehicle system. The PEMFC stacks and other elements have to be bigger in size
and heavier in the gasoline-fueled fuel cell vehicle system in order to achieve the
same power output.
In conclusion, hydrogen-fueled fuel cell cars have a more straightforward sys-
tem architecture, less system weight, greater electrochemical performance, higher
fuel economy, and cheaper investment costs. Due to the high volumetric energy
density of liquid fuels, fuel cell cars that run on methanol or gasoline have a greater
range. Methanol-fueled fuel cell cars among these three fuel cell vehicles became
the most economically viable after at least two years of operation, assuming the
same maintenance cost and lifetime. After three to four years of operation,
gasoline-fueled fuel cell vehicles are more cost-effective than hydrogen-fueled fuel
cell vehicles. Of course, if a carbon emission penalty is taken into account, this
issue has to be reassessed.
5.6.2
SOFC-Based Fuel Cell Vehicle Systems
Due to its high efficiency and fuel adaptability, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) pro-
vides several fixed and mobile application possibilities. The POX reformer and a
12-kW SOFC unit make up the SOFC subsystem. In contrast to hybrid PEMFC/
battery vehicle systems, hybrid SOFC/battery vehicle systems directly provide
all of the power loads from the power battery. Thus, the driving experience of this
hybrid SOFC/battery car is comparable to that of an electric vehicle system that is
only powered by batteries. To greatly increase the driving distance, the power
battery is directly charged by the SOFC unit.
In general, solid oxide FCs (SOFCs) are not taken into consideration for propul-
sion in automotive applications due to their high operating temperature and slow
start-up times. However, because SOFCs can run on reformed diesel fuel and do
not need the establishment of hydrogen fuel facilities, they are being developed for
auxiliary power units (APUs). Truckers will be able to power the sleeper cabins
using SOFCs thanks to the development of APUs for trucks, which will eliminate
the need to idle the diesel engine while the driver is sleeping [61]. Due to their high
operating temperature and lengthy start-up times, SOFCs are typically not thought
of for rocket engines in vehicle industries [62]. However, since reformed gasoline
and diesel can be used in these systems without the development of hydrogen
supply facilities, SOFCs for APUs are being established [61]. For instance,
SOFC-based APUs are being created to replace the need for idle diesel engines
in stationary cars.
An additional choice is a SOFC-battery hybrid system, in which the battery is in
charge of the vehicle’s quick start-up and resource efficiency during braking, and
the SOFC stack is used to either drive or recharge the battery. The SOFC-battery
5.6 Hybrid Fuel Cell/Battery Vehicle Systems
107

hybrid systems have a lower top speed but comparable driving range and acceler-
ation times to PEMFCs [59].
5.6.3
Present Situation of Fuel Cell Vehicle Technology
More than 35,000 fuel cell cars will be sold by the end of 2023, and Toyota and
Hyundai will each sell more than 10,000 fuel cell cars. Future sales of fuel cell vehi-
cles will rise as a result of the conventional vehicle’s equal recharging time. As a
result, the customer drives the long route without hesitation. In comparison to a
conventional vehicle, the fuel cell electric vehicle has a low operating cost [63].
The fuel cell vehicle is being promoted by Indian officials due to its numerous
advantages in the context of green and clean energy. In contrast to the rising cost
of conventional fuel in the worldwide industry, they claimed that the number of
green hydrogen fuel vehicles would rise in the future, allowing every Indian to pur-
chase green fuel. This raises the nation’s overall level of independence. The gov-
ernment also finances numerous initiatives to create environmentally friendly
hydrogen vehicles. By 2030, India wants to have produced five million tonnes
of green hydrogen [64].
5.6.4
Confronts of Fuel Cell Vehicle Technology
Keeping the fuel cell stack’s temperature under control and storing hydrogen are
the two biggest challenges for fuel cell vehicles. Since hydrogen has a pressure of
about 700 bar (10,000 psi), storing it is challenging. Only a few fuel cell electric
vehicle models are offered globally, with the Toyota Mirai being the most well-
known model. There are a finite number of fueling stations for fuel cell electric
vehicles. The Toyota Mirai is a fuel cell electric vehicle that the Indian government
has introduced. After the start of the green hydrogen project in 2025, a hydrogen
fueling station will be accessible. Compared to electric and conventional vehicles,
the cost of a fuel cell vehicle is very high. Car manufacturers keep working to bring
down the price of fuel cell electric vehicles. The most crucial factor for fuel cell
electric vehicles is public awareness. The Toyota Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle
was introduced by the Indian government, and a pilot project there began in
March 2023. The project to launch fuel cell cars for people is very beneficial [64].
5.7
Barriers and Challenges
The terms “barrier” and “challenges” refer to things like rules, laws, or policies
that prevent anything from occurring as well as difficulties that might be resolved.
All stakeholders, including mobility drivers, logistics providers, infrastructure
108
5 Multi-Energy Technologies in Green and Integrated Transportation Networks

operators, shipowners, environmentalists, public officials, legislators, enterprises,
R&D institutions, and academic institutions, must be taken into account when
analyzing the barriers and challenges because their respective initiatives and goals
differ from one another [65]. To make the goals of all stakeholders more manage-
able, barriers and challenges are segmented into the compliance, organizational,
scientific, economic, and public segments. However, the most recent COVID-19
pandemic have created a number of new difficulties in production processes
and logistic support [66].
5.7.1
Societal Barriers and Challenges
Due to rapid urbanization, inhabitants and rising incomes have shifted topograph-
ically over the past several years, which have fueled an increase in the road trans-
port system’s reliance on cars. This is made worse by the shift to service-oriented
jobs, which are more likely to be found in cities, as well as the ineffectiveness of
authority at all levels in planning to promote sustainable and inclusive develop-
ment [67]. The distance between individuals living and working is growing as a
result. This has been unable to show how transportation, territory, residential,
and employment legislation have been comprehensively incorporated at the
nationwide, geographical, and microlevels [68]. Due to fierce competition during
a period of rapid urbanization, lower penetration levels and a reluctance to engage
in automobiles with increased emission regulations were seen in the case of the
transport industry. Increased taxes during organizing could cause perverse incen-
tives and harm domestic transporters’ ability to compete. The interruption of the
existing policies may raise concerns about a loss of domestic profitability, which
could lead to slower adoption of new methods and service practices in the cargo
industry segments. Social approval of the transformative process to accomplish the
GT objectives is ambiguous because of the uncertainty surrounding the level of
engagement between the public and policymakers [69]. Consequently, this is a sig-
nificant issue for decision-makers because they are unable to put initiatives into
effect without public support.
5.7.2
Technological Barriers and Challenges
Scientific knowledge, future technologies, and engineering applications of
technological advancements are noted as being key factors in GT’s goal of environ-
mentally friendly transportation. Technological innovations can be used to reduce
environmental pollution and ensure the sustainability of natural resources.
However, the main obstacles and challenges to a successful transformation of
technology from conventional to innovative are modification, restricted access
to low-carbon technologies, and lack of performance of technology [70]. High-
quality energy sources and the use of more environmentally friendly, highly
5.7 Barriers and Challenges
109

effective transportation methods may improve vehicle performance and lessen
environmental problems. The number of vehicles is rising, though, due to current
policy decisions. In order to significantly reduce the pollution load caused by
vehicle fleets and the use of low-quality fuels, a variety of technologies (such as
enhanced automotive vehicles and fuels) should be embraced. It is best to
maximize the use of low-carbon fuels rather than liquid fuels. Alternative energy
sources and automobiles, such as renewable fuels, biogas, battery-operated cars,
hybrid electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell cars, are currently in the market
or nearly commercially viable [71]. However, there are a number of complicating
factors that contribute to weak sustainability, such as high capital costs, a lack of
natural resources, the growth of filling stations, high maintenance costs, and
negative public understanding. It is crucial to deploy the new technology with
knowledge that is easily available to end users and legislators.
5.7.3
Financial Barriers and Challenges
The economic cause of poor sustainable practices is the cost of going sustainable,
as green technologies are too expensive because of decaying infrastructure in both
developing and developed nations. It is challenging to implement the necessary
changes to move to GT without the backing of a strong infrastructure [72]. Because
of the need for required facilities, such as a freight channel and roads, for the effec-
tive delivery of GT, developing nations are falling behind [73]. To address these
issues and meet GT’s current needs, the outdated facilities must be renovated. Gov-
ernment and financial institutions are least interested in undertaking this full or
partial rehabilitation because it requires a significant time and financial commit-
ment, especially given the state of the economy in 2008. Transportation regula-
tions should be designed to draw major investment firms.
5.8
Conclusion
Due to the growing attention to adopting sustainability in the global increasing
urbanization, the existing transport network should be transitioned into a sustain-
able and inclusive GT by implementing novel technology and management
approaches. This chapter created the conceptual underpinning of a sustainable
transportation system from the context by describing GT and identifying limita-
tions and problems in constructing the GT. In recent years, there has been a huge
need for green supply chains, green ecotourism, and a sustainable economy in
order to accomplish global sustainability objectives. Unfortunately, the current
public transportation networks are unable to shift the global transportation system
toward green on a technological and environmental level. Yet, this study
110
5 Multi-Energy Technologies in Green and Integrated Transportation Networks

demonstrated that using multi-energy technologies in green and integrated trans-
portation systems in the current transportation system might have positive effects
on the environment as well as the economy. Thus, it can be concluded that in order
to transform a current transport network into a GT and advance sustainable
growth, multi-energy technology adoption in green and integrated transportation
systems is essential. The integration of GT with green ecotourism, green distribu-
tion networks, and GT should be done to create a resource-efficient system that
will replace the existing cycle and be the futuristic society, even if it is not
addressed in this study and is left to future studies. The most effective strategy
for creating smart cities and smart tourism, while taking into account the environ-
mental and financial benefits, is green transportation.

Introduction
6.1.1
Problem Description and Motivation
Climate changes have caused serious concerns about the future of the world [1].
With increasing the average global temperature, human beings and agriculture are
exposed to a high risk of extinction. Therefore, it does not matter how capacity is
the global fossil fuel resources or when they run out. The matter is that the current
exploitation rate of fossil fuels may cause irreversible damage to the environment.
To overcome this problem, policymakers have decided to accelerate investment in
renewable energy extraction. There is no doubt that future energy systems are
independent of fossil fuels and dependent on renewable energies. To decarbonize
energy systems, renewable energy should penetrate all energy sectors, including
power [2], heat [3], and mobility (transportation) [4]. Therefore, sector coupling
is essential to transform renewable energy, e.g., wind energy, into thermal energy
in the residential heating system [5] or mobility in electric vehicles (EVs). The
power-to-X (P2X) structure is a long-term solution not only to couple different
energy sectors but also to provide enough reserve and flexibility [6]. The flexibility
potentials of the P2X are reflected in the flexible operation of facilities and
demands in different sectors. The facilities include water electrolyzers, hydrogen
storage, chemical processes, district heating (DH), and electric and hydrogen
vehicles. Therefore, the flexible operation of joint sectors counterbalances the
renewable power fluctuation. Consequently, the sustainable P2X structure
118
6 Flexible Operation of Power-To-X Energy Systems in Transportation Networks

requires the flexible operation of coupled sectors. This is the main motivation
of this study to provide a critical review of the flexibility potentials of the P2X
facilities in different sectors.
6.1.2
State of the Art
In the literature, the number of research studies in the domain of P2X plants has
increased recently. Many scoping studies have been conducted to investigate the
operation of energy sectors in P2X systems. Generally, the P2X transforms renew-
able energy, e.g., wind, solar, and geothermal, into other forms of energy, e.g.,
hydrogen, heat, syngas, and liquid chemical fuels, which are easily storable and
transformable in energy sectors. Therefore, the P2X is comprised of various energy
networks including power networks, heat networks, gas networks, and transpor-
tation systems. Some review studies are carried out to discuss the structure of
energy management in the mentioned sectors. To provide a general insight into
the P2X, Figure 6.1 elaborates on the different energy sectors as intermediary or
final P2X products.
First, the power-to-hydrogen (P2H) plants transform renewable power into
hydrogen energy. The hydrogen can be stored in the storage, e.g., tanks or salt
caverns, or be used as feedstock for downstream sectors. A comprehensive review
is presented to discuss methodologies of carbon- and hydrocarbon-assisted water
electrolysis in hydrogen production facilities [7]. Technological, financial, and
environmental aspects of green hydrogen production plants are surveyed to pro-
vide a sustainable operation for large-scale plants [8]. The state of the art of inte-
grated photovoltaic (PV) and hydrogen production facilities is presented [9]. The
technical challenges of solar to hydrogen are also reviewed. The challenges and
prospects of renewable-based hydrogen production plants are surveyed to decar-
bonize stationary power applications [10]. A holistic review is provided about the
expansion planning of integrated power-hydrogen-gas energy systems [11].
Hydrogen energy can be transformed into syngas, methane, and liquid fuels. In
addition, the hydrogen may be injected into gas networks directly. Syngas and syn-
thetic methane are used by other sectors, e.g., industries and heating systems. In
Ref. [12], the advanced methodologies are discussed to produce hydrogen or syn-
gas using solar-thermal aided reforming of methane feedstocks. A critical review is
conducted for power-to-syngas facilities supplied by various renewable energy
resources including hydro, wind, solar, bio, and geothermal energies [13]. Syngas
is suggested as a substitute for natural gas in power and mobility sectors to relieve
socioeconomic and environmental concerns [14]. The current methodologies of
catalytic bi-reforming of methane are reviewed to produce clean syngas [15].
A mini-review is presented to investigate the environmental implications of
hydrogen-rich syngas production [16]. In addition to syngas, renewable power

is transformed into chemicals and liquid fuels which are easily stored and trans-
formed. Recent technologies are reviewed to produce green liquid fuels, i.e., formic
acid, formaldehyde, methanol, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel [17]. Advanced meth-
odologies of power-to-methanol production are reviewed from a viewpoint of sys-
tems engineering [18]. The scoping study discusses commercialization methods to
choose methanol as the final production.
In the conventional heating system, fossil fuels are the main energy source of
building heating systems for both space heating and hot water consumption. In
the P2X system, hydrogen energy can be used in green hydrogen boilers or trans-
formed into power to supply electrical heat pumps (HP). A literature review of
power-heat sector coupling is presented to contribute to renewable power integra-
tion and energy system decarbonization [19]. An extensive survey is conducted to
address the joint heat-to-power flexibility potentials of electrically operated heat-
ing systems, including HP, and DH [20]. The flexibility potentials of HP with their
barriers and methods of energy efficiency improvement are reviewed [21]. In Ref.
[22], 34 large-scale projects are reviewed to address demand response programs
(DRPs) of power-to-heat plants. The flexibility opportunities of electricity-thermal
systems, including buildings and DH, are surveyed [23].
The future mobility sector benefits from P2X in EVs and hydrogen fuel cell elec-
tric vehicles (FCEVs). In EV fleets, the electrical batteries act as the source of elec-
trical storage and flexibility for the power grid [24]. In public parking lots, the
aggregated storage capacity of parked EVs provides great flexibility potential for
the supply network [25]. The flexibility potentials of EVs in the power distribution
grid and the technical, economic, and regulatory barriers to EVs’ flexibility inte-
gration are reviewed [26]. In addition to EVs, the aggregated flexibility potentials
of parked hydrogen vehicles can be integrated into energy hubs [27]. Intelligent
parking lots integrated with electrolyzers, hydrogen storage, and fuel cells facili-
tate the flexible operation of P2X [28]. Flexible interoperation of hydrogen electro-
lyzers and heavy-duty trucks reduces system operation costs and carbon dioxide
emissions [28].
To sum up, Table 6.1 surveys the key objectives of some recent review studies in
different energy sectors of the P2X structure. The references are extracted from var-
ious publishers to convey the general objectives of multidisciplinary domains
including power, thermal, and chemical engineering.

industrial, and agricultural sectors. The key objectives and applications of energy
flexibility are discussed. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no comprehensive
review study has been conducted to elaborate on the flexibility potentials of differ-
ent energy sectors of the P2X. Therefore, the main contributions of the current
study can be stated as follows:
1) Providing an extensive review of flexibility potentials of different energy sectors
in the P2X structure, including power-to-hydrogen, power-to-chemicals,
power-to-syngas, power-to-heat, and power-to-mobility, as well as electricity
demand, i.e., residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors.
2) Classifying the key objectives and applications of the flexibility opportunities in
different energy sectors of the P2X system with key results and the studied
region.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In Section 6.2, the flexibility
potentials of Power-to-Hydrogen facilities are discussed. Section 6.3 addressed the
flexibility opportunities of Power-to-Methan plants. The flexible operation of
power-to-chemical, including diesel, formic acid, and methanol, is explained in
Section 6.4. The power-to-heat sector is described in Section 6.5. Section 6.6
illustrates the flexibility potential of the mobility sector. In Section 6.7, flexibility
is discussed in four electricity demand sectors. Finally, Section 6.8 concludes the
review study.
6.2
Power to Hydrogen
The power-to-hydrogen (P2H) sector transforms renewable power into hydrogen
energy through water electrolysis. In water electrolysis, renewable power is used
to decompose water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The electrolysis
process takes place in an electrolysis cell which is comprised of anode/cathode
electrodes, a catalyst, and a membrane. Generally, the electrolysis is carried out
based on three main technologies as follows:
1) Alkaline water electrolysis [44]
2) Polymer-electrolyte membrane [45]
3) Solid oxide electrolysis [46]
Water electrolysis is the core part of P2H plants. The main product is H2, which
is a storable energy commodity. The by-product is O2, which can be further utilized
by downstream industries. The chemical reaction of the water electrolysis can be
formulated as follows:
2H2O
2H2 + O2

6 Flexible Operation of Power-To-X Energy Systems in Transportation Networks

Figure 6.2 describes the energy paradigm of the P2H plants. In this figure, the
inlet and outlet energy and materials are stated. As the graph reveals, the outlet
hydrogen energy can be used in three ways:
1) Store in hydrogen storage and/or salt caverns
2) Inject into the gas network directly
3) Export to (hydrogen-to-X) H2X facilities
First of all, the produced hydrogen can be stored in hydrogen storage. Gen-
erally, hydrogen storage is in the form of storage tanks and salt caverns. There
is a direct relationship between the flexible operation of the electrolyzer and
storage capacity. To ensure constant operation of the electrolyzers, an adequate
storage capacity is required. The “adequate storage capacity” is determined con-
sidering the lull duration of renewable energies. The main challenge of hydro-
gen tanks is the large dimensions. Increasing the storage volume of the
hydrogen, the dimension and investment cost of the storage tanks increase
noticeably. To overcome this problem, salt caverns are the practical solution
to store hydrogen underground. The salt caverns have a geometrical volume
from 100,000 to 1,000,000 m3 [47]. Salt caverns suffer from local constraints.
It means that the salt caverns are normally created on salt bed deposits. The
stored hydrogen can be used by (1) fuel cells to reconvert to power and (2)
H2X plants to convert to other types of energy commodities.
The produced hydrogen can be injected into the natural gas network directly.
The amount of hydrogen injected into the gas network is limited. The reason is
that the mixture of hydrogen reduces the gas quality. Meanwhile, it increases the
loss of the natural gas network. In the literature, it is suggested that the accept-
able amount of hydrogen share in the gas network should not exceed 10%. In
some studies, a higher share of hydrogen blending is investigated. The results
show that the injection point plays a key role in the upper threshold of hydrogen
blending. In this way, as the hydrogen injection point approaches the pipeline
outlet of the gas network, the loss of the natural gas network decreases up to
36.5% [48].
In the literature, many studies have been conducted to unlock the flexibility
potentials of P2H plants in response to renewable power fluctuations. Table 6.2
surveys the key objectives and flexibility purposes of some recent studies for
P2H plants. In Ref. [57], the P2X is suggested to counterbalance the wind power
fluctuation and decarbonize the transportation sector. The study proposes a new
energy system that is comprised of combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP),
wind power, and hydrogen electrolysis systems. The daily production capacity
of the hydrogen electrolysis reaches 500 and 260 kg in winter and summer, respec-
tively. Besides, the total energy system efficiency increases to 72%. The levelized
costs of hydrogen models in China are discussed in the research study [58]. The

study concludes that the cost of the hydrogen model for coal-to-hydrogen is
13.1–19.4 RMB/kg, which is 20.5–61% lower than the hydrogen production elec-
trolyzed by renewable energies. In Sweden, the feasibility of hydrogen production
is investigated in nuclear power plants to hedge against the inherent inflexibility of
the power plant. Besides, hydrogen production for industrial applications is dis-
cussed [59]. Molten salt heat storage is addressed to improve the operational flex-
ibility of the power grid whose electricity and heat demands are supplied by
hydrogen production. The results confirm a 4.4% reduction in the operational cost
of the power grid [60]. In Ref. [61], the power and hydrogen networks are inte-
grated to supply fuel cell EVs with the purpose of maximizing daily profit. The sim-
ulation results show that the integrated network increases the daily profit by up to
25.32% and decreases the renewable energy curtailment by up to 36.4%. In Ger-
many, the P2H system is discussed to decarbonize energy-intensive industries,
e.g., copper production, through on-site hydrogen production. Based on the result,
not only are the heavy industries decarbonized but also the by-product of oxygen
brings economic benefit [62]. In Ref. [63], a multi-energy hub system is proposed
to deliver power, heating, cooling, and hydrogen. The study aims to maximize the
total energy efficiency of the energy system using fuel cells. The results reveal that
the suggested structure increases energy efficiency by up to 87.43%. In a smart
multi-carrier energy system, hydrogen storage is considered a flexible resource
to counterbalance renewable power fluctuations. The power is converted to hydro-
gen energy in low-price hours (surplus of renewable energy), and then electrical
power is generated by hydrogen-based fuel cells during high-price hours (deficit of
renewable energy) [64]. In Ref. [65], a multi-carrier storage system is comprised of
thermal storage, ice banks, and hydrogen storage to supply electricity, heating, and
cooling demands. Minimizing the operational cost of the energy system, the sim-
ulation results confirm up to a 5% reduction in the total system operation cost. The
P2H and lithium batteries are evaluated to hedge against wind power fluctuations
[66]. The study concludes that the P2H is more beneficial for profitability, reliabil-
ity, and full-load operation. In contrast, the lithium battery is advantageous in
reducing the lost wind with a lower environmental impact. To conclude this sec-
tion, Table 6.3 classifies the flexibility potentials of hydrogen storage and con-
sumption in the P2H facilities.

Power to Methane
Power to methane (P2M) is an energy sector in which the original renewable
power is transformed into synthetic gas energy through the methanation process.
Methanation is an exothermic chemical reaction in which carbon dioxide and
hydrogen are converted to methane through hydrogenation. Methanation is a

The methanation methods are classified into two different approaches:
(i) Thermochemical methanation [80] and (ii) biological methanation [81]. In
the former, the methanation process is done using a transition metal catalyst with
an efficiency of 70–85% [82]. In the latter, the methanation is carried out using
microorganisms or biogas with an efficiency of 75–98% [83].
Figure 6.3 describes the different sections of P2M facilities. Based on the dia-
gram, the main share of produced methane is injected into the natural gas net-
work. Generally, natural gas is comprised of more than 75% methane [84].
Therefore, in contrast to hydrogen, there is no limitation to inject methane into
the gas pipelines. For regions with well-developed natural gas networks, pipelines
are the best solution. In intercontinental applications, the gas network may not be
practical due to oceans and deep seas. In this condition, compression and lique-
faction facilities are applied to convert methane into pressurized and liquefied
methane, respectively. Consequently, the volume decreases noticeably, especially
for the liquid methane. The liquid/pressurized methane can be transported by
trucks, trains, and ships. It is worth mentioning that the liquefication/compression
facilities consume a certain percentage of methane energy [85]. The compression
and liquefaction plants consume 7.2–13% [86] and 10–25% [87] of methane energy,
respectively. It means that the total efficiency of the P2M facilities decreases for
compressed and liquid methane.
The produced hydrogen of P2H plants is the main feedstock of the methanation
facilities. In the P2H sector, two technical factors limit the flexible operation of the
electrolyzers: (i) the limited share of the hydrogen blending to natural gas net-
works and (ii) the limited storage capacity of hydrogen tanks. Consequently,
the methanation facilities can increase the flexibility potential of the P2H plants.
In the literature, many studies have been conducted to facilitate the flexible oper-
ation of methanation plants. In Ref. [88], a mathematical model is suggested for
power-to-renewable methane in regions with high penetration of wind energy
and biogas plants. The problem aims to provide power grid balancing in the Baltic
States, including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The results show that the current
wind power potential can increase mechanized biogas by up to 48.4%. The
dynamic model of power-to-synthetic natural gas is presented in Ref. [89]. The
study investigates the impact of hydrogen generation, storage, and buffering
devices on the operation of the P2M plants. The role of P2M plants is studied in
the security and operation of the networked energy hubs, including power and
gas grids [90]. The results confirm that the suggested approach can overcome
gas shortages in critical hours. Moreover, it reduces wind generation curtailment.

The economic analysis is carried out on a fully renewable P2M system [91].
The study concludes that the Levelized cost is between 0.24 and 0.30 €/kWh of
SNG. Also, it conveys that the by-products, e.g., oxygen, can increase the compet-
itiveness of the P2M plants. In Ref. [92], the P2M plant is suggested as an auxiliary
operation of thermal power plants. Based on the study, the competitiveness of the
P2M depends mainly on the interconnectedness of other technologies. The anal-
ysis reveals that the payback period for the P2M facilities ranges between 3.8 and
5.1 years. A poly-generation system is proposed for hydrogen production and elec-
tric power generation [93]. A combined-cycle power plant is modeled to utilize
methane. The results show that the poly-generation system can reach an exergy
efficiency of 83.1%. In Ref. [94], a bio-P2M system is discussed to convert the biogas
carbon dioxide to methane. Based on the results, if the bio-P2M is integrated with
renewable energies, the suggested system can meet the 2026 EU goal of green-
house gas (GHG) reduction. The research study [95] proposes liquid CO2 energy
storage as a flexible regulator for P2M facilities to hedge against the uncertainties
associated with renewable power, gas demand, and electricity prices. In this way,
CO2 energy storage ensures continuous power and gas production. A bi-level
profit-driven approach is suggested for P2M systems to maximize the benefit of
electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen sectors [96]. In the upper level, the energy
value and price bids are submitted in the day-ahead markets for the three
energy commodities. In the lower level, the multi-carrier energy markets are
characterized. To have a general insight into the flexibility potentials of methane
storage and gas network injection, Table 6.4 explains some recent studies for
P2M facilities.

Power to Chemical (P2C)
In the power-to-chemical (P2C) process, the electrical power is converted to liquid
energy commodity or chemical energy. In the literature, power-to-liquid [104] and
power-to-fuel [105] have a close relation to the P2C concept. Chemical energy nor-
mally is used in the transportation and chemical industries. Methanol, synthetic
diesel, and formic acid are the most important chemical products of the P2C. In the
following, the three liquid fuels are described.

There are two widely accepted technologies to produce liquid fuel including
methanol synthesis [106] and the Fischer-Tropsch reaction [107]. Diesel is an eas-
ily transportable energy commodity that can be transported via pipe networks or
fuel transportation fleets, e.g., railway, ship, and trucks.
In the literature, some studies have been conducted to produce diesel fuel from
renewable hydrogen. In Ref. [108], an experimental study is conducted to produce
diesel fuel from biomass. Also, the study integrated wind energy into hydrogen
production facilities, P2G, and biomass-to-liquid processes. The study concludes
that wind energy can be stored in chemical commodities with high energy den-
sity. Considering diesel as a transportable energy carrier, a research study shows
that renewable energy in North Africa can be transformed into Hydrogen, diesel,
or gasoline and transported to Europe by pipe networks and/or tankers (ships)
[109]. Therefore, liquid fuel is an economic intermediary energy commodity to
transfer renewable energy from North Africa to the center of Europe at the price
of 54–119 €/MWh. In another study, synthetic diesel is suggested as a means of
renewable energy storage [110]. The study concludes that the suggested system
can supply between 0.9% and 32% of the annual diesel demand for road transpor-
tation with 100% emission savings. However, the production cost of synthetic die-
sel is not competitive enough in comparison to conventional diesel. Synthetic
diesel plays a key role in energy system decarbonization. The research study sug-
gested dimethyl ether as a synthetic diesel for road transportation with low CO2,
NOx, and particulate matter emissions [111]. It is shown that synthetic fuel can
decarbonize the agricultural sector. To have a net-zero local energy system, a
dairy farm is modeled with microturbines, solar panels, batteries, and synthetic
fuel production facilities [112]. The results reveal that the electricity generation of
the farm is profitable; adversely, the synthetic fuel production causes high costs
that make it nonprofitable. In Sweden, synthetic fuel is used to integrate renew-
able energies into the transportation sector [113]. Comparing hydrogen, methane,
methanol, and diesel in the transportation sector, the results show that methane
and diesel have great potential for cost competitiveness in the near term. In con-
trast, hydrogen is price-competitive for longer terms. A hybrid energy system is
suggested to supply transportation fuel in Finland with renewable energy
[114]. The hybrid system is comprised of PV, wind generation units, electrolysis,
and hydrogen-to-liquids plants. Based on the results, the combined renewable
electricity-diesel value chains are competitive for crude oil prices within a min-
imum price range of about 79–135 US$/barrel regarding costs associated with cap-
ital, oxygen, and CO2 emissions. Although synthetic fuels are used to supply
industries and the transportation sector, a study is carried out in the Maldives
to decarbonize the energy systems by substituting diesel generations with 100%
renewable energies, including floating offshore solar PVs, wave power, and
offshore wind [115].

6.4.2
Power-to-Formic Acid (P2FA)
In power-to-formic acid (P2FA), hydrogen and carbon dioxide are reacted chem-
ically to produce formic acid as the following formulation [116]:
CO2 + H2
HCOOH
6 4
Formic acid is a nontoxic environmentally friendly hydrogen energy with low
flammability under ambient conditions that show great applicability in the
mobility sector [117]. Generally, formic acid has applications as an energy carrier
and a chemical combination. In the former, formic acid is used to carry hydrogen
energy. In the latter, formic acid is used in heavy industries, chemical industries,
food industries, and pharmacological manufacturing for non-energy applica-
tions. The current study concentrates on the energy applications of hydrogen
energy carriers; therefore, the latter is excluded. Considering formic acid as
hydrogen energy, formic acid impacts the energy systems with the following
objectives:
1) supplying the transportation sector with green hydrogen energy;
2) storing renewable electricity in the form of a green hydrogen carrier;
3) decarbonization of energy systems and industries.
First, formic acid supplies the transportation sector, including vehicles, buses,
and trucks, with green energy. Formic acid can generate electricity in two ways:
(i) direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) [118] and (ii) indirect hydrogen fuel cell
(IHFC) through dehydrogenation reactions [119]. The DFAFC is suggested for
the mobility sector to replace traditional fossil fuels. In Ref. [120], a 25 kW formic
acid-to-power system technology is proposed to supply city buses or serve as a
standalone carbon-neutral electricity generator unit. Storage technologies are
developed to store hydrogen energy in the form of formic acid [121]. Formic acid
has a high volumetric hydrogen storage capacity of 53 g H2/L: therefore, it takes
advantage of low-cost and large-scale hydrogen storage and transportation in
contrast to energy-intensive hydrogen liquefaction and compression [122]. For-
mic acid not only provides green energy to the transportation sector but also
causes a net reduction of carbon dioxide due to the captured CO2 during the syn-
thesis process, i.e., Eq. (6.4). A technical report carried out by the EU Commis-
sion shows that the capacity of the carbon dioxide utilization plant depends on
the available renewable power, rather than on the product’s demand [123]. To
sum up, Figure 6.4 explains how the green formic acid decarbonizes the mobility
sector.

Power to Methanol (P2Me)
In the power-to-methanol (P2Me) plants, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are reacted
to produce methanol and water using the following formulation [124]:
CO2 + 3H2
CH3OH + H2O
6 5
The hydrogen energy of methanol normally supplies the mobility sector in
three ways: (i) methanol blending with fossil fuel vehicles (FFVs), (ii) direct
methanol fuel cells (DMFC), and (iii) indirect methanol fuel cells (IMFC).
In methanol blending, alcohol-blended fuels are used in fossil fuel-based
engines to reduce emission production [125]. In the DMFC, the chemical
energy of liquid methanol is transformed into electric power through an elec-
trochemical energy conversion process [126]. In the IMFC, also called
reformed methanol fuel cell (RMFC), the liquid methanol is reformed before
feeding the fuel cells.
The flexible operation of P2Me plants plays a key role in the integration of
intermittent renewable energy into chemical production. The research study
shows that the flexible operation of chemical processes can reduce the methanol
production cost by 20–35% [127]. In addition to the flexible operation of the
P2Me facilities, the flexible operation of the electrolysis system and power grid
should be integrated to hedge against intermittent renewable power. The
dynamic simulation of methanol synthesis reveals that the energy efficiency
of the P2Me varies between 75.4% and 90.2% under different load change opera-
tions [128].
A research study is conducted to assess the production and transportation costs
of switching from fossil fuels to renewable methanol [129]. The results reveal that
the production cost of renewable methanol can reach the market price of fossil
fuels by 2030. In Ref. [130], wind energy and captured CO2 are discussed in six
countries to decarbonize the transportation-power nexus and reduce gasoline
consumption. A chemically recuperated gas turbine is suggested to be fed by
renewable methanol from power-to-liquid facilities. The integrated gas turbine,
hydrogen electrolyzer, and methanol production plants can store a surplus of
renewable energy with very low CO2 emission and an overall power-to-power effi-
ciency of 0.23 [131]. In the other study, a novel system is proposed to produce solar
methanol by hybridizing natural gas with an energy efficiency of 62% [132]. When
the system is integrated with a power generation unit, the net solar-to-electricity
efficiency reaches 23%. To elaborate more on the energy management of power-
to-liquid plants, Table 6.5 classifies the key characteristics of flexible operation,
objectives, and outcomes.

Power to Heat (P2H)
Power-to-heat (P2H) refers to energy-converting technologies that generate ther-
mal energy for heating purposes including space heating and domestic hot water
(DHW) consumption. In heat networks, the heat energy is distributed to consumers
through DH systems. The heat sources of the DH can be power or fuel. Regarding
power, electric boilers and HP convert electric power directly to thermal energy. In
the latter, the heat source can be natural gas, syngas, and chemical fuels. Therefore,
there is a strong interdependency between the heat and power networks to coun-
terbalance the renewable power fluctuations. Figure 6.5 explains the flexibility
potentials of P2H for both electric and hydrogen energy consumption.
Regarding the power source, the total energy efficiency of HP is much higher
than that of electric heaters. Although the investment cost of HP is currently
higher than that of electric heaters, saving energy can compensate for the high ini-
tial investment within a few years depending on energy prices. The HP operations
are normally optimized by heat controllers. The heat controller can unlock the
flexibility potentials of space heating and DHW consumption in response to the
energy price or flexibility needs of the upstream networks. In Ref. [137], a model
predictive control (MPC) is suggested to unlock the flexibility of the residential
heating system in response to day-ahead electricity prices. The flexibility of resi-
dential heating systems stems from the upper and lower thresholds of indoor

air temperature and hot water. The research study suggested a stochastic structure
for the MPC to incorporate the electricity price uncertainties of three successive
electricity market floors, including the day-ahead, intraday, and balancing mar-
kets [138]. In addition to individual HP, many residential buildings are supplied
by DH through mixing loop control. Therefore, a mixing loop controller is dis-
cussed to optimize the operation of hot water valves [139]. The on-off states of
the mixing loop valves are optimized to unlock the flexibility of space heating
in response to variable energy prices. In Ref. [140], a two-layer stratified hot water
tank model is presented for electric boilers to integrate flexibility potentials of res-
idential heating systems into a low voltage distribution grid in Northern Jutland,
Denmark. The role of flexible thermal units in voltage control and grid congestion
mitigation is also addressed. A research study was conducted in Norway to inves-
tigate the role of electricity price scenarios on the flexible operation of electric boi-
lers integrated with thermal storage as the backup system of HPs [141]. The result
reveals that electric boilers contribute to 17% of the heat supply in the case study.
In addition to the electric HP, the gas pumps are operated by hydrogen energy.
The technical operation, coefficients of performance (COP), and exergy efficiency
of chemical HP are discussed [142]. A thermo-economic cost analysis was carried
out for a small prototype of the isopropanol-acetone-hydrogen chemical HP in
China [143]. The simulation results revealed that the COP and exergy efficiency
of the system were 24.3% and 42.3%, respectively. Although this type of HP is nor-
mally used to recover industrial waste heat, it can supply the DH systems in
urban areas.
6.6
Power to Transport (P2T)
By increasing the penetration of EVs in private and public transportation, road
maps and traffic routes are attracting attention in energy system studies [144].
Nowadays, the transportation sector is not supplied by fossil fuels alone. Electricity
and hydrogen energies are displacing traditional fuels to meet climate change
requirements [145]. In the mobility sector, there are three types of vehicle fleets
as follows:
1) FFVs, supplied by gasoline and natural gas;
2) plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), supplied by electric power;
3) FCEVs, supplied by hydrogen- and formic acid-based energy.
Figure 6.6 sketches the energy paradigm of the P2T sector. In the transportation
sector, the FFVs are the main consumers of P2D products [146]. Synthetic diesel is
used for conventional vehicle fleets. In recent years, the FFVs have been retired
6.6 Power to Transport (P2T)
143

and replaced by PEVs and FCEVs. The PEVs can provide noticeable demand flex-
ibility for power systems [147] and the P2T sector. The PEVs are mobile electrical
batteries that can be charged/discharged when a renewable power excess/shortage
occurs on the supply side. The PEVs are discussed in private and public parking
lots [148]. In large-scale parking lots, the parking lot operator can coordinate the
charging/discharging operation of the PEVs [149]. In the private parking lots, an
intermediary entity, e.g., a demand response aggregator, is required to integrate
the flexibility potentials of individual PEVs in response to the flexibility require-
ments of the supply networks. Public parking lots exhibit considerable electric
storage capacity to counterbalance renewable power fluctuations [150]. Smart
charging stations play a pivotal role in the flexible operation of PEVs [151]. In
the home parking lots, the occupancy pattern, driving patterns, and PEV owners’
behavior affect the charging/discharging operation of PEVs [152]. In public park-
ing lots, the traffic pattern depends on the application of the parking lot. For offi-
cial parking, the electrical storage is normally accessible during working hours on
weekdays. Therefore, the time duration and capacity of available electric storage
depend on the number of office staff and the length of working hours. For the park-
ing of an entertainment complex, the electric storage capacity is normally acces-
sible outside of working hours with a lower time length [153]. Dwell time, arrival/
departure State of Charge (SoC), and drivers’ willingness to participate in the DRPs
are the main factors affecting the flexibility potential of public parking lots. The
FCEVs are new hydrogen energy consumers in the mobility sector [154]. The

FCEVs can be supplied by hydrogen and formic acid. In the hydrogen FCEVs, the
hydrogen energy is transformed directly into electric power [155]. In the formic
acid FCEVs, the electric power is generated by direct and indirect fuel cells in
which the formic acid is converted to electricity directly or through dehydrogen-
ation reactions.
6.7
Power Demand Flexibility
In power systems, electricity consumers play a pivotal role in meeting flexibility
requirements. The electricity consumers are discussed in four sectors, including
residential, industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors. Responsive demands
can integrate demand flexibility into power systems when a power shortage occurs
or system reliability is jeopardized due to failure or unforeseen maintenance.
Figure 6.7 explains the various flexibility potentials of electricity consumers in
power systems. In residential buildings, the HEMS unleashes the flexibility potential
of household appliances [156]. Household appliances are divided into three
main categories: (i) thermostatically controlled appliances (TCA) [157], (ii) non-
thermostatically controlled appliances (Non-TCAs) [158], and (iii) uncontrollable
appliances. The first group includes HP, HVAC, refrigerators, and electric water hea-
ters (EWH). The second group addresses wet appliances, e.g., washing machines,
dishwashers, and tumble dryers. The uncontrollable appliances normally refer to
TV, Radio, and basic lighting systems which are not subject to DRPs. In Norway,
the flexibility potentials of EWH are calculated for different levels of flexible power
and activation time. The result indicates that the highest flexibility potential is
approximately 54% for a duration of 61 minutes at 8 a.m. [159]. The flexibility poten-
tials of 10 residential buildings are discussed in Madrid, Spain, to integrate HP into
solar-assisted DH with thermal storage [160]. The flexibility potentials of HVAC sys-
tems are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm in Portugal to reduce operation
costs and interaction with the power grid [161]. Home refrigerators with flexible
chamber temperatures are discussed as flexible resources in the HEMS [158]. The
refrigerator’s flexibility stems from the limited gap between the upper and lower
thresholds of the chamber temperature. Wet appliances are a practical solution to
shift energy consumption out of peak demand. In France, a practical study on
100 French households shows that wet appliances can provide peak shaving for
the supply side at a net-zero cost [162]. It is worth mentioning that rooftop PV sites
can increase the flexibility opportunities of residential buildings significantly. This
way, household energy consumption can be supplied by solar power during high
solar irradiation hours and be supplied partially by the stored energy in electrical
batteries out of daylight hours [163].

Figure 6.7
General flexibility potentials of four sectors of electricity consumers in power systems.

In the industrial sector, energy-intensive industrial processes provide great
flexibility for power systems. In cement manufacturing plants, some processes,
e.g., crushers and cement mills, are interruptible: therefore, they can be turned
off/on when a power shortage/surplus occurs in the electricity market [164]. Metal
smelting plants are comprised of different smelting pots. The operation processes
of the smelting pots are normally uninterruptible, but the power consumption can
be turned up/down by variable voltage controllers and tap changer transformers in
response to the flexibility requirements of the supply side [165]. Oil refinery indus-
tries are consumers of power, heat, and steam supplied by power and gas grids.
They have self-generation facilities, e.g., gas turbines and heat boilers, to supply
domestic energy needs. The generation facilities can provide power and gas flex-
ibility for the energy networks when an energy shortage happens in the power/gas
grid [166].
In the agricultural sector, demand flexibility can be addressed for crop farming
and livestock farms. In crop farming, water irrigation pumps show great flexibility
potential. In Ref. [167], a robust optimization model is proposed to schedule the
power consumption of water pumps out of peak hours. As a result, peak shaving
and valley filling are provided for the power system. The variable frequency drive
of water pumps can turn up/down the power consumption in response to excess/
deficit of renewable power in the electricity market [168]. Tower water storage is a
practical solution to draw water from an underground well during low electricity
price hours: then the crops can be irrigated by gravity or less power consumption
during high electricity price hours [169]. In New Zealand, six large-scale dairy
farms are studied to shift demand out of peak periods and balance grid demand.
Based on the results, flattening demand reduces electricity costs for the milking
process by 3.3% [170]. In Ref. [171], Poultry Demand-Side Management is sug-
gested in Bangladesh to facilitate the use of solar energy in poultry farms and
decrease the dependency on the power grid.
In the commercial sector, supermarket refrigerators exhibit great flexibility
potential. In Denmark, a research study was conducted to improve the flexibility
of supermarket refrigeration systems based on Danfoss A/S. The study concludes
that the estimation of food temperature plays a key role in the improvement of
DRPs [172]. The optimal DRPs of commercial buildings in a heavily urbanized
area are studied [173]. To deploy the DRPs, different commercial buildings, includ-
ing hotels, shopping malls, and offices, are discussed in Huangpu district, Shang-
hai. In Iran, a research study investigated the flexibility potential of commercial
EV parking lots to supply the demand of shopping stores, office buildings, food
courts, and entertainment complexes [153]. To extract the demand flexibility in
the four sectors, expert knowledge is required. Therefore, based on Figure 6.7,
the flexibility potential of the demand sectors is integrated into power systems
by intermediary agents called Industrial Demand Response Aggregators (IDRA)

Conclusion
In this chapter, the flexibility potentials of eight different energy sectors of power-
to-X facilities are discussed. The energy sectors include power-to-hydrogen,
power-to-methane, power-to-diesel, power-to-methanol, power-to-formic acid,
power-to-heat, power-to-transport, and electric power demands.
In the power-to-hydrogen plants, hydrogen storage, i.e., storage tanks and salt
caverns, plays a key role in flexible operation. Although the share of hydrogen
injection into the gas network is limited to 10%, the flexible interoperation of
the gas network and hydrogen electrolyzers can counterbalance the renewable
power fluctuations. In the power-to-methan plants, storage tanks, salt caverns,
and saline aquifers play a pivotal role in the flexible operation. Also, there is no
limitation to inject methane into gas grids: therefore, the gas networks increase
flexibility opportunities. For regions without gas network access, energy-intensive
liquefaction and compression processes are applied which decrease the energy
content by up to 25%. Power-to-chemicals, including power-to-methanol and
power-to-Formic Acid, decarbonize the mobility sector. Green methanol and for-
mic acid can supply EVs through direct and indirect fuel cells. Also, methanol can
be blended with fossil fuels to decrease GHG emissions. Therefore, the flexible
operation of the power-to-chemical depends strongly on the flexible operation
of the mobility sector. Regarding the power-to-heat, the thermal demands can
be supplied by electricity, e.g., HP and electric boilers, or green hydrogen boilers.
The main flexibility of heat demand stems from the flexible bound of buildings’ air
temperature and DHW consumption. In the power-to-mobility sector, EVs are
supplied by direct electricity and hydrogen energy, i.e., hydrogen, formic acid,
and methanol. This way, there are strong ties between traffic control, energy man-
agement of parking lots, and flexible operation of the power-to-chemical and
power-to-transport sectors.
Power demands are addressed in four sectors, including residential, industrial,
agricultural, and commercial sectors. In the residential sector, the home energy
management system unlocks the flexibility of household appliances, e.g., HP,
refrigerators, and wet appliances. In the industrial sector, the power consumption
of energy-intensive industrial processes, e.g., cement crushers and metal smelting
pots, can be turned off/on or up/down in response to the flexibility requirements of
the power systems. In the agricultural sector, the water irrigation pumps, water

tank towers, and on-farm solar sites provide great flexibility potential for the power
system. In the commercial sector, supermarket refrigerators and public parking
lots are addressed as great sources of flexibility potential. To sum up, the key points
of the chapter can be summarized as follows:
1) The flexibility potentials of different energy sectors in the P2X structure enable
the integration of renewable energies into energy systems in the forms of green
hydrogen, chemicals, syngas, heat, and power.
2) The storage capability of various P2X sectors makes it possible to store renew-
able power in different forms of energy commodities.
3) The flexibility potentials and storage capabilities of the P2X energy sectors mit-
igate the volatility and intermittency of renewable energies.
4) The flexibility potentials of the transportation sector, particularly PEVs and
FCEVs, play a pivotal role in decarbonizing energy systems.

Introduction
More than 50% of the world’s population resides in urban areas [1]. Developed
countries in Europe and North America already have more than 70% and 80%,
respectively, of their population classified as urban dwellers. This continuous
trend of urbanization has led to an increase in sustainability challenges in cities.
For example, cities currently consume approximately 75% of all resources and
account for around 70% of all greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Securing a clean,
affordable, and reliable energy supply is one of the primary sustainable develop-
ment challenges of cities for which, integrating renewable energy sources (RES)-
based electricity into the energy mix, using innovative concepts such as Smart
Grid, is a potential solution. Although, electricity only satisfies a portion of a city’s
energy needs[3], there is an increasing interest in expanding its role in sustainable
urban development to shape future smart cities.
Multi-Energy System (MES) is gaining increasing attention as a promising
approach to tackle the growing energy consumption needs while mitigating green-
house gas emissions and promoting sustainable energy systems. MES integrates
multiple energy sources, such as electricity, natural gas, and renewable energy,
with various energy storage technologies, such as batteries, thermal storage,
and hydrogen storage, to provide a reliable and efficient energy supply [4]. Differ-
ent energy sources in MES are coupled by an energy hub (EH) or integrated energy
station (IES) [5–7]. MES has different definitions in the literature [8]. For example,
it has been considered as an innovative integration of energy sectors, including
gas, water, electricity, cooling, heating, and transport, at different stages to enable
the creation of more services and profitable streams [9].
An MES requires harmony in the operation and planning of the integration of
energy systems across various routes and geographic locations that offer reliable
166
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

and sustainable energy delivery with minimal impact on the environment [10]. In
addition, MESs offer optimization capabilities in the form of energy conversion to
meet the specific requirements of consumers [11, 12]. It can provide significant
advantages such as operational flexibility, sustainable energy utilization, and
improved reliability. MES comprises various complex components, such as com-
bined heating and power (CHP) systems, combined cooling, heat, and power
(CCHP) systems, heat pumps (HP), boilers, refrigerators, thermal and electricity
storage systems, and power-to-gas (P2G) converters [13].
EH is the state-of-the-art solution for MES modeling. It enables the conversion,
conditioning, and storage of multiple carriers, thus making it easier to model and
operate MES [14–16].The incorporation of RES like photovoltaic (PV) and wind
power provides advantageous prospects in the system operation of EH and has also
attracted significant attention globally [17]. Furthermore, electric vehicles (EVs)
are being recognized as a potential answer to enhance flexibility in MES due to
their rapid response, economic viability, and eco-friendly nature. This has led
to increased interest in operating an MES structure that incorporates renewa-
ble-based generation systems and EVs, leveraging the advantages of the smart grid
perspective [12].
The integration of EVs can significantly enhance the overall effectiveness and
sustainability of the MES. EV-grid integration requires careful consideration of
the charging infrastructure and energy management strategies to optimize perfor-
mance. This integration is important because changes in electricity load resulting
from the adoption of EVs can affect the operation of energy conversion systems
like CHP, gas-fired generators, boilers, and others. In addition, by leveraging
the bidirectional power flow capabilities of EVs, they can be utilized as a means
of energy storage to balance energy demand and supply [18, 19].
Many studies have primarily focused on examining the interconnection between
EVs and power grids, disregarding the significant interdependencies between
alternative-fuel-powered modes of transportation or mechanical energy storage
and the broader energy infrastructure. For example, a multi-objective optimization
approach is proposed in Ref. [20] for modeling the components of advanced dis-
tribution networks (ADNs) and identification of the optimal location and size of
charging stations. Wang et al. [21] use a stochastic approach to develop an
approach for expanding the planning of ADNs that considered shared charging
stations and the charging behavior of users. The authors in Ref. [22] propose a pla-
nning model for distributed generators, charging stations, and charging demand,
which identified the distribution curves indicating the likelihood of EVs parking
time and durations. However, these studies made the common assumption that
charging demand could be predicted in advance using pre-collected data or prob-
ability distributions, neglecting the consequences of flow patterns in traffic
networks.
7.1 Introduction
167

In Ref. [23], operational challenges associated with interconnected transportation
and distribution systems are investigated, highlighting the potential security risks of
an unguided traffic flow. Following that, a model for expansion planning based on
scenarios for an ADN coupled with a transportation system is presented in Ref. [24],
emphasizing the significance of accounting for the interconnectedness of the two
systems. Additionally, a two-stage robust optimization method is employed to
effectively synchronize the integrated networks, taking into account the uncertain-
ties associated with renewable energy and demand.
The critical topic of the smart charging of EVs involves a set of smart feature sets
that enable a versatile and energy-efficient ecosystem for charging and dischar-
ging. This is achieved by facilitating communication between the EVs and the
power grid. The rapid acceleration of electrical equipment manufacturing with
higher power ratings is imperative to facilitate ultra-fast charging. Powerful con-
verters and integrated control approaches for intelligent charging coordination at
high power levels are examples of how the charging time of EVs can be reduced
effectively [25]. Smart charging can not only increase power transmission effi-
ciency but also helps to mitigate the electricity demand from the grid. Additionally,
charging EVs using solar and wind power can promote products that are designed,
manufactured, and utilized in a manner that promotes sustainability.
Smart bi-directional charging, also called Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) can bring a new
role for EVs as ancillary service providers to the grid, e.g. for frequency control
[26].By offering these services, smart charging has the potential to slash energy
costs of owners associated with EVs by up to 60%. [27]. Furthermore, EV batteries
serve a critical function in the charging process of EVs and as energy storage for
grid integration. In the V2G mode, during periods of high demand, EVs are com-
monly linked to the grid to strengthen grid performance and stability.
In light of the explanations provided above, despite significant research on EV
and MES separately, there is potential to explore optimal strategies for integrating
EVs within MES. This could include investigating the most efficient and effective
ways to integrate EVs into existing MES through energy management and system
optimization. Furthermore, comprehensive studies are needed for modeling
approaches that consider the dynamic interactions among EVs, RES, storage sys-
tems, and the grid. Developing robust and holistic modeling approaches that cap-
ture the complexities of MES with EV integration could be an area for further
research. Moreover, while there may be research into the technical aspects of inte-
grating EVs within MESs, there could be a research gap in terms of exploring the
economic and policy aspects of this integration. This could include investigating
the economic viability of different integration strategies, evaluating the impact
of policies and regulations on the integration of EV within MES, and assessing
the potential economic benefits and challenges associated with this integration.
In addition to this, still research gaps exist in terms of real-world implementation
168
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

studies that demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of integrating EV within
MES. Examining case studies or pilot projects that have implemented or tested dif-
ferent integration strategies in real-world settings could provide valuable insights
into the challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned from actual implementa-
tion efforts.
This chapter provides a review of the EV-MES integration. The novelty of this
book chapter lies within its comprehensive review of original research works asso-
ciated with the modeling and management of MES integrating EV routing and
charging. It highlights the interdependencies between the energy and transport
infrastructure in the MES, particularly in the context of transport electrification
and the challenges and opportunities it presents. By addressing the interdependen-
cies and optimization opportunities within the MES, this chapter provides a holis-
tic approach to understanding the integration of EVs into MESs and offers insights
into the potential benefits, challenges, and solutions for achieving sustainable and
efficient energy systems in the context of transport electrification. The comprehen-
sive review of original research works in this area adds value to the existing liter-
ature and provides valuable information for researchers, and policymakers
interested in the field of MES and EV integration.
Section 7.2 reviews the structure of MESs, the general aspects and assessment of
MES modeling, the concept of EHs and their role in the modeling and implement-
ing of MES, and the challenges in MES modeling. Section 7.3 investigates the inte-
gration of EVs with MESs, including integration with RES and the power grid. It
also reviews the different strategies for charging/discharging of EVs. Section 7.3
provides the conclusion and future recommendations.
7.2
Multi-energy Systems Structure
Integrating multiple energy carriers like electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, and
thermal energy in an MES is a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency
and decrease the expenses related to energy supply. However, with the availabil-
ity of various energy converters and storage devices with distinct characteristics,
the selection of appropriate types and capacities of these devices and their
effective management pose significant challenges in designing optimal MES
structures. Due to the remarkable progress in information and communication
technologies, coupled with the proliferation of smart devices such as smart
meters/sensors, actuators, switchgears, communication and metering infrastruc-
tures, and embedded smart energy management systems, the development of
MES has evolved into smart multi-energy System (SMES) [28, 29]. Within this
smart environment, devices from each network can exchange relevant informa-
tion and identify potential synergies in a coordinated manner, resulting in

customized and ideal resolution for individual sectors as well as the entirety of the
SMES simultaneously. An SMES structure is a complex energy system that inte-
grates multiple energy sources and storage technologies to meet energy demands
in an efficient, sustainable, and reliable manner. It is developed to improve effi-
ciency in the use of various energy sources and storage technologies, including
renewable and non-renewable sources, while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions
and reducing energy costs. The diagram in Figure 7.1 illustrates the structure of a
typical SMES that is in use at the community level. This SMES connects to the elec-
tricity, natural gas, and district heat distribution networks via input ports, and the
output ports provide a range of multi-energy services, such as power, heating, and
cooling, all simultaneously. The power, heating, and cooling hubs function as
energy nodes, responsible for gathering and distributing power, heat, and cold
energy. At any given time, the energy at each hub remains in balance, which means
that the energy input matches the energy output. This arrangement allows for a clear
visualization of energy flows and the links between energy converters and storage
devices. The SMES structure consists of four main components:
• Energy sources: The SMES structure includes multiple energy sources such as
solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro-, and fossil fuels. The system uses these
energy sources to produce electricity and heat to meet the energy demands of
various applications.
• Energy storage: The SMES structure includes various energy storage systems
like batteries, hydrogen, pumped hydro-, and compressed air energy storage.
These technologies store excess energy generated during off-peak hours and dis-
charge it during peak periods, thereby ensuring a continuous and stable energy
supply.
• Energy conversion: The SMES structure includes various energy conversion
technologies such as fuel cells, combustion engines, and turbines. In other word,
the energy converters include photovoltaic, wind turbine (WT), transformers,
gas turbines, gas boilers, heat exchangers, electric chillers, and absorption
chillers. These technologies convert stored energy into electricity and heat for
various applications.
• Energy management: The SMES structure includes advanced energy
management systems that monitor and control energy flows between different
components of the system. These systems optimize the use of energy sources
and storage technologies to meet energy demands in the most optimal and
economically feasible way.
In the context of the main components in a MES, diverse energy requirements of
end-users can be met using various sources, including renewable generators such
as PV and WT, gas turbines, storage systems, or the power network. Similarly,
heating demands can be addressed through options such as gas turbines, gas

boilers, heat storage systems, or district heat networks. Cooling demands can be
fulfilled using electric or absorption chillers. The MES also possesses a bidirec-
tional communication infrastructure, smart energy meters, and a smart multi-
energy management system (SMEMS). The SMEMS collects data on electricity
and natural gas prices, device status, weather patterns, PV and WT power outputs,
and power, heating, and cooling loads, among other factors. Utilizing this data, the
SMEMS develops an optimal energy management and dispatch approach, sending
control signals to each component to efficiently coordinate the operation of the
entire energy system.
The SMES structure is also designed to achieve several benefits, including:
• Energy security: The incorporation of multiple energy sources and storage
technologies reduces dependence on a single energy source, such as fossil fuels.
This makes the system less vulnerable to supply disruptions or price volatility
associated with a single energy source. The SMES structure can also escalate
the reliability of energy supply by providing backup energy storage during peak
demand periods or grid outages.
• Cost-effectiveness: The integration of multiple energy sources and storage
technologies can optimize the use of energy resources and reduce the need
for expensive grid infrastructure. For example, by using energy storage technol-
ogies to accumulate energy when demand is low, the SMES can help to decrease
the need for peak generation capacity and lower overall energy costs. Addition-
ally, by reducing energy waste through better energy management, the SMES
can lower energy costs for both the system and the end-users.
• Sustainability: By promoting the use of RES and energy storage technologies,
the SMES can help to mitigate these environmental impacts and set the stage for
a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. Additionally, the use of these technol-
ogies can help to reduce the dependence on finite resources and can ensure a
more reliable and sustainable energy supply for future generations.
7.2.1
General Aspects of MES Modeling
The analysis and evaluation of how various energy systems interconnect and influ-
ence the overall performance of the energy system is known as the modeling and
assessment of MES. This field encompasses the integration of diverse energy
sources and the assessment of the trade-offs involved in their use within the energy
grid. MES modeling and assessment involve a comprehensive study of various
energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro-, fossil fuels, and nuclear energy. This
analysis considers the energy demand and its variability, including the energy
requirements of different sectors such as industry, residential, and commercial.
Additionally, the study focuses on energy storage options like batteries, pumped
172
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

hydro-, and thermal energy storage to manage the variability in energy generation
and demand. The modeling of the energy network, including the interconnections
between different energy sources and the energy grid, is also a critical aspect. The
economic viability of different energy sources and the cost of integrating them into
the energy grid is evaluated, along with an assessment of the environmental
impact, including emissions and land use. By evaluating various energy sources
and their interconnections with the energy grid, MES modeling and assessment
can identify the most effective and economical approaches for integrating different
energy sources. Moreover, it can assess the impacts of diverse energy policies on
the energy system and provide crucial information for decision-makers in priori-
tizing investments in different energy sources and infrastructure. In addition to
this, modeling of MES involves the use of mathematical and computational meth-
ods to simulate the behavior of the energy system and its components. The prin-
cipal objective of MES modeling is to achieve a thorough comprehension of the
interrelations among the various energy sources and the energy grid, while eval-
uating the trade-offs between them. Below are some of the key elements of MES
modeling:
• Energy demand modeling: This modeling encompasses the examination of
the patterns and fluctuations of energy demand, considering the energy neces-
sities of various sectors, including industrial, residential, and commercial. By
employing energy demand models, one can evaluate the energy requirements
of a specific location and determine the effects of energy-conservation measures
on energy demand. To estimate the energy requirements of a specific location,
energy demand models use data from multiple sources such as weather fore-
casts, demographic information, and economic trends. By analyzing this infor-
mation, energy demand models can accurately predict the demand of different
sectors at different times. Moreover, this modeling plays a pivotal role in pla-
nning and managing the energy supply of a region. By accurately estimating
the demand, energy providers can optimize the design and operation of energy
generation systems as well as energy storage systems to ensure that the grid can
reliably meet the demand of consumers. Furthermore, this part of MES model-
ing allows for the optimization of energy systems design and operation and helps
evaluate the impact of energy-conservation measures on energy demand. These
models can be used to estimate the impact of building retrofits or energy-
efficient appliances on the demand of residential or commercial sectors.
• Energy generation modeling: This part of the MES modeling includes mod-
eling various energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro-, and nuclear energy, to
estimate their energy yield and evaluate the impact of weather conditions on
energy generation. In energy generation modeling, a variety of factors are taken
into account, including solar radiation, wind speed, water flow, and reactor
7.2 Multi-energy Systems Structure
173

power output. By analyzing these factors, energy generation models can esti-
mate the energy yield of different sources under various conditions. These mod-
els can be used to optimize the design and operation of generation systems and
to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating new or alternative energy sources into
the grid. Weather conditions have a substantial impact on the generation of
renewable sources. Energy generation models also take into account different
weather scenarios, including seasonal, daily, and hourly variations, to estimate
the energy output of renewable sources accurately. This helps to ensure that the
energy grid can reliably fulfill the demands of the consumers and can accommo-
date fluctuations in supply.
• Energy storage modeling: Energy storage modeling is also one of the funda-
mental aspects of MES modeling and assessment, providing critical insights into
the performance and efficiency of energy storage systems, which are vital com-
ponents of a reliable and sustainable energy system. It involves modeling energy
storage systems like batteries and pumped hydro- storage to estimate their
capacity and efficiency. Energy storage models are necessary for assessing the
ability of energy storage systems to manage fluctuations in generation and
demand, which is of particular significance for variable RES like wind and solar.
Energy storage modeling enables the identification of the most cost-effective and
efficient energy storage technologies that can be integrated into the grid to sup-
port renewable sources. This helps in minimizing the need for expensive and
environmentally damaging backup power sources, such as natural gas plants,
during times of low generation or high demand. This part of MES modeling also
enables the assessment of the impact of several factors on the performance of
storage systems, such as the ambient temperature, battery or storage system deg-
radation, and the depth of discharge. This information is crucial for optimizing
the storage system design and operation, maximizing their benefits, and mini-
mizing costs.
• Energy network modeling: Network modeling is a crucial part of the model-
ing and evaluation of MES. It involves creating a model that encompasses all
relevant aspects of the energy infrastructure, including the interconnections
between different energy sources and the grid, to assess the performance of
the energy infrastructure and its ability to meet the demands of consumers.
Energy network models simulate various scenarios of energy generation, stor-
age, and distribution to identify potential issues in the grid and develop solutions
to mitigate these issues. For example, an energy network model can assess the
impact of integrating a new energy source, such as a wind farm, into the existing
energy infrastructure, helping to identify the optimal location for the wind farm
and the required upgrades to the grid to ensure a reliable energy supply. Further-
more, network models can estimate the cost of integrating different energy
sources into the grid by analyzing the cost of generation, storage, and
174
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

distribution. The model can help identify the most cost-effective solutions for
meeting demand, which is useful for decision-makers in determining invest-
ment priorities and developing energy policies.
• Economics modeling: MES economic modeling involves analyzing the eco-
nomic feasibility of various energy sources and the associated costs of integrat-
ing them into the energy grid. Economic models estimate the cost of energy
generation and storage and analyze the impact of energy policies on the energy
system. Economic modeling accounts for several factors, such as capital, oper-
ational, and maintenance costs, fuel costs, and financing costs, to estimate the
overall cost of energy generation and storage for different energy sources. The
costs can differ, depending on the energy source type, location, and the level
of technology employed for energy generation and storage. The models can also
assess the impacts of various energy policies on the energy system. For example,
economic models evaluate the impact of carbon pricing or subsidies on energy
generation and storage costs, which is valuable for policymakers to identify suc-
cessful interventions to promote renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. Furthermore, economic models identify the most cost-effective solu-
tions for meeting energy demand. By analyzing the costs of energy generation,
storage, and distribution, these models help determine the most economically
feasible combination of energy sources and the most efficient methods for inte-
grating them into the grid.
The operational and planning optimization of MES is often a complex process
due to the diverse range of potential MES types that can be envisioned. Advanced
modeling techniques and tools are necessary to address this complexity. It is cru-
cial to capture both the complexity of interactions between multiple sources of
energy occurring within the MES and the interactions with the external environ-
ment. Power system operators must recognize that distributed multi-generation
(DMG) and multi-energy loads, previously considered passive by power system
operators, must be integrated into the power system operation to achieve a sustain-
able energy system while minimizing costs. Because many DMG systems operate
at small or even micro-scale levels (For example, micro-CHP generators that are
installed in residential homes), general aggregation concepts have been proposed
to integrate distributed energy resources into power system operation and pla-
nning [30]. Microgrids [31, 32] and virtual power plants (VPP) [33, 34] are two
such concepts that can be implemented in MES. On the other hand, the EH con-
cept has been particularly established to technically model generic MES [15, 35].
The significance of these aggregation notions is underscored from an economic
standpoint, indicating a necessity to shift away from the traditional scheme of con-
structing large-scale power plants subject to regulated rates of return, and instead
develop new business models for these novel, distributed systems.
7.2 Multi-energy Systems Structure

7.2.2
Energy Hub Concept
Researchers have shown an increasing interest in utilizing the EH approach for
implementing MES [36–40]. In Ref. [36], an EH was defined as a computer-
simulated environment where energy carriers are transformed into load demand.
Various technologies are available inside the box for energy conversion and stor-
age, as depicted in Figure 7.2. In MES modeling, an EH is a central facility that
integrates multiple energy sources and energy carriers to manage energy supply
and demand more efficiently. EH uses advanced optimization algorithms and con-
trol strategies to balance the flow of energy across different sectors, such as resi-
dential, commercial, industrial, and transportation. They can incorporate various
energy sources, including RES like solar, wind, and geothermal, as well as non-
renewable sources like fossil fuels and nuclear power. These sources are integrated
into the EH through various energy carriers, such as electricity, natural gas, hydro-
gen, and thermal energy [41]. One of the primary functions of EH is energy stor-
age, which, by using technology like batteries, pumped hydro, or compressed air,
can accumulate surplus energy during periods of low demand and distribute it
when demand is high. This helps balance the energy supply and demand, reducing
the need for fossil fuel-based peaking power plants and minimizing energy waste.
EH also distributes energy to different sectors. For example, a microgrid can be
used to supply electricity to a local community, while a district heating system
can supply thermal energy to buildings. By optimizing energy distribution, EH
can help reduce transmission losses and increase energy efficiency. Designing
and operating an EH requires interdisciplinary energy engineering, economics,
and policy expertise. Energy engineers design the technical components of the
EH, like energy storage systems, conversion technologies, and distribution net-
works. Economists evaluate the economic viability of it and analyze the costs
and benefits of different energy sources and technologies. Policy experts assess
the regulatory framework and incentives needed to support the development
of an EH.
As shown in Figure 7.2, the EH is comprised of several components, including
input and output, conversion, and storage units. In essence, it is an extension of
power system network nodes. The EH framework includes inputs such as natural
gas, electricity, and district heat networks, as well as energy conversion compo-
nents including a natural gas boiler, CHP, transformer, heat exchanger, electric
heat pump, and absorption chiller. The EH also includes battery/thermal storage
devices [42]. Finally, the EH outputs include heat, cool, and electricity. In this
regard, an EH can be broken down into the following four basic areas. The first
is energy generation, which encompasses producing energy from various sources,
including RES like solar, wind, and geothermal, fossil fuels like coal and natural
gas, and nuclear energy. The second component is energy storage, which involves
using energy storage technologies like batteries, pumped hydro-, or compressed air
176
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

to store excess energy during periods of low demand and release it during periods
of high demand. Energy storage systems employed in EH may include heat
storage, hot water tanks, hydrogen tanks, batteries, ice storage, and flywheels.
The third component is energy conversion, which utilizes energy conversion
technologies like boilers, chillers, CHP units, heat pumps, fuel cells, electrolysers,

or power electronics to convert energy from one form to another (e.g., from
electricity to hydrogen or from thermal energy to electricity). These conversion
technologies enable the management of different energy resources entering the
system and balance supply and demand. Finally, energy distribution involves
the distribution of energy across various sectors such as residential, commercial,
industrial, and transportation. Energy distribution technologies employed in EH
may include microgrids, district heating and cooling systems, and hydrogen
pipelines. The hub energy demands for end-users may include electricity, heat,
cooling, gas, water, and hydrogen. The energy vectors used as inputs to the EH
system may come from any of these sources.
MES planning and management involves the challenge of determining the
facilities, systems, or networks required for energy supply, storage, and conversion
technologies to effectively fulfill energy needs. Recent studies suggest that a
coordinated approach for planning and managing MESs is more desirable
compared to the current practice of uncoordinated development. Deterministic
and probabilistic models are used to employ the EH scheme for evaluating the
management of MESs. Moreover, planning objective functions (OFs) are used
to make decisions when planning an EH. The OFs refer to the objectives that guide
decision-making during the planning process. These objectives can be broadly
grouped into three categories: technical, economic, and environmental. The main
OFs that are commonly used include minimizing investment costs, operational
costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. These OFs are typically related to the cost
and environmental impacts of different energy conversion, storage, and supply
technologies [8]. Nevertheless, the majority of studies that focus on planning
micro-energy systems tend to emphasize economic and technical objectives,
with little consideration for environmental objectives. This is a significant gap,
as ecological consequences of energy production and consumption systems are
of increasing concern globally. Therefore, there is a need to incorporate environ-
mental objectives into planning models for EH. Furthermore, few studies have
compared the advantages of management and planning an EH that synergizes
various energy carriers (such as electricity, heat, and gas) with independent energy
carrier planning. To address this gap, some objective functions have been proposed
for EH planning, including the following:
• Minimizing investment and operating cost: This OF designs an energy sys-
tem that can produce the desired amount of energy with the lowest possible
investment in equipment and infrastructure, and the lowest possible operating
costs. To this end, a careful analysis of the different components that make up
the energy system, including energy generation, transmission, and storage, is
required. It can involve choosing equipment and technologies that require less
178
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

maintenance and have a longer life span, as well as optimizing the operation of
the energy system to reduce energy waste and increase efficiency.
• Minimizing lifecycle cost (LCC): This involves assessing the total cost of a
project over its entire lifecycle, including design, construction, operation, and
maintenance costs. The aim is to optimize the LCC by selecting the most
cost-effective technologies and designing the system to minimize overall costs.
• Maximizing the share of RES penetration: This objective is driven by the
need to mitigate the effects of climate change by lowering greenhouse gas emis-
sions, as well as to increase energy security and diversify the energy mix. This OF
involves assessing factors such as the availability and reliability of renewable
sources, their cost and competitiveness relative to other energy sources, and
the potential impacts on the grid and energy storage requirements. Additionally,
it may be needed to consider the policy and regulatory frameworks that support
the development of renewable sources, such as feed-in tariffs or renewable
energy targets.
• Minimizing energy costs and emissions: This goal is strongly linked to the
previous objectiveof minimizing lifecycle costs, as reducing energy costs and emis-
sions often requires a focus on energy efficiency, which can result in long-term
cost savings. One approach to minimizing energy costs and emissions is to pro-
mote the adoption of RES, which can be used to displace fossil fuel-based energy
sources that are associated with high emissions. Another approach to achieving
this objective is to increase the efficiency of the energy system by reducing energy
waste, such as through improved insulation and building design, and by optimiz-
ing the use of energy in buildings, industry, and transportation. This can involve
the use of energy efficient appliances and equipment, as well as the progression of
smart grids and energy management systems that can contribute to a better
balance between energy supply and demand and also reduce energy waste.
• Maximizing system reliability and profits: System reliability gauges the sys-
tem’s ability to deliver energy consistently and without interruption, while prof-
its refer to the financial benefits of operating the system. To achieve this
objective, a range of factors that can impact system reliability and profits, such
as the availability and quality of energy sources, the efficiency of energy conver-
ters and storage devices, the cost of maintenance and repair, and the demand for
energy should be considered. Incorporating advanced control systems and pre-
dictive maintenance strategies can help identify potential issues before they
become major problems, allowing for timely repairs and maintenance that
can prevent downtime and ensure consistent energy delivery. Additionally,
incorporating backup power sources or redundant systems can be considered
to further improve system reliability. Maximizing profits can also involve stra-
tegies such as pricing energy at different rates based on demand, implementing
7.2 Multi-energy Systems Structure
179

demand-response programs that incentivize customers to reduce energy usage
during peak demand periods, or integrating energy storage devices to take
advantage of fluctuations in energy prices.
• Maximizing social welfare: This objective considers various factors, such as
energy access, affordability, and equity. It should be considered that the benefits
of the energy system are distributed fairly across different segments of society.
Moreover, maximizing social welfare also involves considering the environmen-
tal impact of the energy system. Planners need to design the energy system in a
way that minimizes its negative impact on the environment while still providing
the necessary energy services to society.
By considering these OFs, a more comprehensive understanding of the costs,
benefits, and environmental impacts of different EH designs and configurations
can be developed. This can help to inform more sustainable and efficient energy
planning decisions and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable energy future.
In addition to those mentioned earlier, the EH planning involves dealing with
constraints that limit the possible values of decision variables, such as operational
or structural constraints. Operational constraints refer to the power system’s lim-
itations, with consideration of power balance, ramping rate thresholds, wind
power accessibility, and transmission flow limits. Gas system constraints are lim-
itations for a gas system, incorporating nodal balance equations, well-flow capac-
ity, nodal pressure, compressor constraints, and pipeline limits. Moreover,
decision variables determine the output demand of an EH. To plan an EH and
solve operational challenges, it is essential to identify decision variables, such as
binary variables, to indicate if an energy converter or storage device is selected,
or continuous variables to represent energy flow at a specific time. Also, EH opti-
mization models fall into the two following categories [8]:
1) Structural optimization finds the ideal configuration and arrangement of an
EH developed on unique energy requirements and relevant objectives’ OFs.
2) Operational optimization involves finding the optimal power dispatch within a
single EH or the optimal power flow within a network of interlinked EH, given
a specific system structure.
7.2.3
MES Modeling Process and Challenges
As discussed earlier, energy system modeling encompasses various sectors, includ-
ing energy infrastructure, technology, RES, and consumer behavior. Modeling
these components accurately is crucial for accounting for the uncertain character-
istics of RES and the actions of market players. However, developing precise MES
models can be a daunting task, and it involves several challenges, including overall
180
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

features such as model formulation and data, as well as specific aspects related to
time and space [41].
• Overall features: One of the main challenges is to define the system boundaries
and select appropriate modeling tools and techniques. Since MES models
involve multiple domains such as electricity, gas, and heat, it is necessary to take
a holistic approach to modeling to capture the interconnections between these
domains accurately. Although energy system models are commonly used to
investigate the technological and economic impacts, they are seldom utilized
to explore the effects of factors such as human behavior, socio-political dynam-
ics, or non-financial challenges regarding technology adoption. These factors
can be important in the development of energy systems, and it is imperative
to incorporate them in the modeling process. Energy systems consist of multiple
interrelated fields, such as power generation, transmission and distribution,
end-use consumption, and energy storage. With the increasing integration of
distributed RES, the increasing interconnectedness among the distinct energy
carriers will continue to rise, adding to the intricate nature of the system and
increasing maintenance costs [43].
• Mathematical formulation: Mathematical formulation is a challenging
aspect of MES modeling, as it involves determining the appropriate level of
detail and accuracy for the models. The models must include the key interac-
tions and dependencies among several energy systems, but not be so complex
that they are computationally infeasible to solve. As a system becomes more
interconnected, the complexity of the mathematical problem increases. One
potential strategy involves breaking down energy flows to derive linear models,
but this could result in significant inaccuracies due to the nonlinear nature of
power flow equations for electricity and hydraulic networks. Optimizing nonlin-
ear constraints requires additional optimality conditions, making the mathe-
matical task even more challenging to solve. MES models need to be complex
enough to capture the essential interactions, but not so complex that they
become computationally infeasible to solve. A balance must be struck between
model accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, var-
ious modeling techniques, such as mixed-integer linear programming, dynamic
optimization, and agent-based modeling have been proposed in the literature.
Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, and the selection of the appro-
priate modeling technique depends on the specific problem being addressed.
The development of a model for operational planning or scenario exploration
purposes often involves multi-criteria examination, which is investigated within
the framework of MES. The process of multi-criteria decision-making involves
several steps, including identification, characterization, and formulation of
the problem, establishing the objectives, and mathematical modeling. This
7.2 Multi-energy Systems Structure
181

approach can be applied to MES planning problems, where a decision-maker
designs a comprehensive and forward-thinking analysis of a specific system,
incorporating diverse criteria, with a forward-looking and enduring perspective.
This holistic approach captures strategies from the demand and supply sides of
the power system, heating/cooling system, fuel systems, transport sector, and
their interactions. To identify an adequate decision situation, a group of decision
variables, alternatives, and criteria must be established [44]. The available
options denote potential resolutions to the problem and can be determined
by evaluating the investments and policies under examination. Each alternative
includes a group of decision variables, such as modifications in the demand,
installed capacity of RES and other MES technologies, use of storage systems,
and sustainable mobility options. Multiple metrics can be utilized to enhance
decision-making efficacy in addressing various challenges within MES. The
process of selecting criteria forms a fundamental step in the decision-making
process, and they must be sufficiently intelligible for each stakeholder, viewed
as a valuable instrument for assessing and contrasting alternative actions, and
must be a coherent family of criteria that is exhaustive, consistent, and non-
redundant. Other desirable properties include intelligibility and operationality.
Each criterion is associated with an attribute, which serves as a yardstick for
assessing the criteria. Attributes are commonly used to describe the features,
qualities, or performance parameters of alternatives, and are quantifiable mea-
sures represented by metrics or indicators that gauge the extent of fulfillment for
a particular criterion. Criteria and their corresponding attributes/metrics that
are typically used in the context of MES may include [44]:
– Economics, which may involve characteristics and measures such as annual
costs, revenues, profits, net present values, and payback times [45].
– Energy consumption/savings, considering primary energy use and savings
compared to a reference case, broken down by type of energy vector or overall
[46].
– Emissions/emission savings, which may encompass global emissions and
emission savings of GHG/CO2, as well as local emissions/pollution such as
CO, NOx, etc. [47].
– Integration of RES and low-carbon technologies, using indicators such as the
quantity of RES integrated into a given system, renewable energy curtailment,
and hosting capacity of the distribution network, among other pertinent
metrics.
– Security of supply, reliability, and resilience, evaluated using performance mea-
sures such as anticipated energy shortfall, frequency and duration of service
interruptions, and so on.
– Comfort level, evaluated through indicators like average indoor temperature
[40] and projected energy reduction by building management systems, among
others.
182
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

• Data collection and management: The development of accurate and robust
models for MES requires large amounts of data from various sources, including
the following data:
– Weather data, including historical and current weather data, such as temper-
ature, wind speed, solar irradiation, and precipitation, which are essential for
modeling RES like solar and wind.
– Energy consumption data, including data on the consumption of energy by
different sectors, such as residential, commercial, and industrial, as well as
data on energy imports and exports.
– Infrastructure data, incorporating data on the physical infrastructure of the
energy system, such as the location, capacity, and efficiency of power plants,
transmission and distribution lines, storage facilities, and other energy-
related infrastructure.
– Economic data, containing data on energy prices, tariffs, subsidies, and taxes.
– Demographic data, including data on population size, growth, and distribu-
tion, as well as data on household and commercial characteristics, such as
building size and age, which can help to model energy demand.
– Environmental data, incorporation of data on environmental factors such as
air quality, water availability, and land use, which can have an impact on
energy production and consumption.
– Social data, such as demographic data, data on energy use patterns and beha-
viors, and data on energy access and affordability.
The availability and quality of data can pose significant challenges, particu-
larly for emerging technologies and systems that lack historical data. Therefore,
data quality and availability are crucial for developing accurate and robust mod-
els for MES. Uncertainty is inherent in all models, and to address it, two types of
uncertainty are discussed in the excerpt: epistemic and aleatory. Epistemic
uncertainty arises when the modeler thinks that uncertainty can be lowered
through improved data and models, whereas aleatory uncertainty arises from
randomness and cannot be reduced by better data or models [48, 49]. Formal
methods, such as the Monte Carlo method, can be used to address aleatory
uncertainty. This method involves iterating through input data to analyze the
variations in the inputs and outputs of a model. For accurate and robust results,
time and space modeling are crucial for MES models. However, acquiring suf-
ficiently fine-resolution data for RES can be challenging. Traditional optimiza-
tion models, that consider energy-based approaches, may not entirely
encompass the resolution obstacles. Furthermore, assigning deviation ranges
to input data and parameters is preferable, although challenges such as data
quality, availability, and compliance with data protection laws may hinder
access to necessary input information, which could be limited to aggregated
levels. Unfortunately, omit comprehensive explanations of the approaches
7.2 Multi-energy Systems Structure
183

utilized to handle uncertainties pertaining to their input data, making it difficult
or impossible to determine the uncertainty. Therefore, researchers must take
measures to address uncertainties in their models by using formal methods
and acquiring high-quality data from various sources to ensure that the MES
models are accurate and robust [50].
• Spatial and temporal requirement: Energy supply may not always align with
demand in terms of location and timing, which can result in an energy imbal-
ance. This can be mitigated through spatial balancing via the grid or temporal
balancing through energy storage, allowing for energy to be released at a later
time when demand is higher [51, 52]. Nevertheless, highly detailed models with
fine spatial and temporal resolution can demand excessive computational
resources that may not be practical within a reasonable time frame. On the other
hand, using a coarse resolution can reduce computational complexity; but, it can
result in less accurate outcomes, as it averages out the extreme points that are
crucial for designing the system [53]. MES models require high-resolution data,
particularly for RES, to accurately represent the spatial and temporal variations
in energy supply and demand. However, acquiring sufficiently fine-resolution
data for RES can be challenging. Spatial resolution refers to the level of detail
in geographic information. For example, solar irradiance varies with latitude,
longitude, and altitude. Therefore, it is necessary to have high-resolution data
on solar irradiance to accurately represent the potential energy yield of a solar
power plant. However, as mentioned earlier, obtaining such data can be difficult
and expensive, particularly in remote or inaccessible areas. Furthermore, the
data may not be available at a small-enough scale to capture all the variations
in the energy supply. It is essential to balance the level of detail required for
accuracy with the computational cost of the model. Furthermore, models that
do not fully incorporate the fluctuations in supply and demand may overstate
the portion of demand fulfilled by renewable energies. Therefore, it is crucial
to consider the full variability of energy supply and demand in MES modeling
to accurately represent the performance of the system. In summary, space and
time resolution is a significant challenge in MES modeling, requiring high-
resolution data and balancing the level of detail required for accuracy with
the computational cost of the model. It is essential to account for the entire spec-
trum of variation in energy supply and demand to accurately represent the per-
formance of the system.

Integration of EVs in MES
Integrating EVs into MES involves incorporating these vehicles into existing
energy systems that may include power, gas, and heat networks. This integration
is important because changes in electricity load resulting from the adoption of EVs
184
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

can affect the operation of energy conversion systems such as combined heat and
power (CHP) systems, gas-fired generators, boilers, and others. To balance the
supply and demand of the energy, EVs can be used as energy storage systems
in MES [18, 19]. Some studies have explored the integration of EVs and renewable
sources with combined power and gas networks to increase the share of renewable
sources. Gas-fired generators have been shown to enhance the interdependency
between natural gas and electricity networks. In addition, some studies have inte-
grated residential charging stations with an integrated power and gas network,
including hydrogen storage, CHP, gas-fired units, non-gas-fired units, and renew-
able sources. However, some studies have focused only on charging EVs and did
not consider discharging them [54–59] have investigated EV charging in inte-
grated power distribution and transportation networks, microgrids with buildings
that have space heating, cooling, and electrical loads, and the presence of EVs in
integrated power and district heat systems. The objective of integrating EVs into
MES is to achieve better energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and create a more
sustainable energy future. To successfully integrate EVs into MES, it is important
to consider various technical aspects such as the capacity and power rating of char-
ging stations, the control and coordination of charging schedules, and the impact
of EV charging on the distribution network. By addressing these technical consid-
erations, EVs can play an important role in balancing supply and demand in MES,
enhancing the use of RES, and creating a more sustainable energy future.
7.3.1
Integration of EV with RES
Integrating EVs with RES is a critical component of the development of MES. By
integrating EVs with RES, the overall energy system can be optimized for maxi-
mum efficiency and minimal environmental impact. RES like solar, wind, and
hydroelectric power can provide a substantial amount of energy to power EVs,
and by utilizing them, the carbon footprint of transportation can be reduced.
EVs can serve as energy storage systems, allowing excess renewable energy gen-
erated during periods of low demand to be stored in EV batteries and used later
when demand is high, which can address the issue of intermittency in RES.
Figure 7.3 illustrates the overall framework that outlines the various RES, EH,
and EV chargers. In different parts of the city, EV charging stations that are pow-
ered by EH will be strategically placed. These areas could include residential sites,
workplaces, schools, hospitals, and other notable places where vehicles may be
parked for extended periods. While superchargers exist for EVs that can charge
a battery within 30 minutes, giving a range of 270 km, standard chargers (Level
2) typically provide an additional 18 km/hour of charging time [60, 61]. Hence,
Level-2 charging stations are suitable for such locations. To establish this infra-
structure, multiple charging points will be installed throughout the city in
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
185

locations where vehicles are likely to be parked for extended periods. These char-
ging points will be energized by EH, which enables the integration of RES. In
Figure 7.3, E indicates an EH at a specific site, like a rooftop, while Cij among
the green rectangle symbolizes each charger that connects to the EH. Moreover,
apart from providing power to charge EVs, the energy generated by these hubs
can also be utilized to meet some of the energy needs of the surrounding area [60].
Researchers have explored various scenarios, such as the optimal integration of
EV charging stations without RES, the optimal integration of EV charging stations
and RES with a controlled charging procedure, and the optimal integration of EV
charging stations and RES with a controlled charging and discharging scheme.
The most promising results were achieved with the optimal integration of EV char-
ging stations and RES with a controlled charging and discharging strategy. This
approach significantly reduced voltage deviation, energy not supplied, and total
cost compared to the base case, with reductions of 73.97%, 50.43%, and 29.55%,
respectively [62]. Research has primarily focused on the potential contribution
of EVs to facilitate the integration of RES in the power system [63–65]. This
research topic is centered on the smart grid paradigm, which uses communication,
control technology, power-electronics technologies, and storage technologies to
balance production and consumption at all levels. EVs can act as a controllable

load or storage, charging or discharging part of their battery capacity back to the
grid, according to the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept [64]. When integrating EVs
with RES in MES, several technical tips must be considered. First, capacity pla-
nning should be considered to ensure that RES and the charging infrastructure
can handle the load requirements of EVs. Second, implementing smart charging
strategies that consider the availability of RES and the changing needs of EVs can
help balance the supply and demand of energy and prevent the overloading of the
power grid. Third, V2G technology should be considered, which allows EVs to
charge from the grid and discharge energy back into the grid when needed, bal-
ancing the grid during peak demand, and supporting the integration of RES.
Fourth, energy storage systems, such as batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, should
be integrated to store excess renewable energy and use it to charge EVs, when
needed. Finally, advanced system control and management tools should be imple-
mented to monitor and optimize the operation of the MES, ensuring energy effi-
ciency, reducing emissions, and enhancing the reliability and stability of the
system. By considering these technical tips, EVs can be effectively integrated with
RES in MES, providing more efficient and sustainable energy solutions while
reducing carbon emissions.
7.3.1.1
Integration of EV with Wind Energy
The integration of EVs with wind power is advantageous for providing ancillary
services due to their ability to respond quickly to changes in the grid’s needs. Ancil-
lary services are support services provided by power systems to ensure the security,
stability, and reliability of the electric grid. These services include frequency reg-
ulation, voltage regulation, and reserve capacity, among others. EV owners may
face a higher upfront cost than those, who opt for internal combustion engine
(ICE) cars. However, Ref. [66] highlights how EVs can offer economic benefits
in the long term. The study examined the potential for EVs to provide ancillary
services in the western Danish power system, with a particular focus on the man-
agement of secondary reserves and load frequency control (LFC).
The authors used simulation models to demonstrate how EVs can efficiently reg-
ulate power imbalances arising from wind-power variability, reducing the reliance
on conventional power plants. This could lead to lower costs for EV owners and a
more sustainable energy system overall. In a similar vein, Ref. [67] introduces a
concept whereby large clusters of EVs and household appliances could be lever-
aged to offer secondary reserves and LFC services in the power system. Simulation
data suggests that EV batteries undergo extensive energy excursions, frequently
transitioning from empty to full charge levels. The study highlights the potential
of aggregating distributed energy resources for enhancing system stability and effi-
ciency, while also underscoring the importance of battery management strategies
for maintaining EV performance and longevity. The authors in Ref. [68] present an
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
187

optimized operation model for EVs in the presence of wind turbines and
dispatchable generation units. They evaluate the impact of coordinated and
non-coordinated EV operations on the stochastic generation of wind turbines,
using distribution functions to model wind turbine variability across various sce-
narios. In one scenario, they assumed that there are some EVs connected to the
grid, but they are not coordinated in the operation with other units. In this case,
it reveals that the absence of coordination resulted in a rise in the dispatchable unit
generation, increased costs, and ultimately decreased profits for the system
operator. In another scenario, the authors suppose that EVs are charged and dis-
charged in coordination with other system units, utilizing coordinated scheduling
to optimize energy utilization. This approach enables EVs to charge during periods
of high wind turbine generation or low-power demand, while stored energy is dis-
charged during peak hours when demand is high, or generation is low. Coordi-
nated charge and discharge operations can enhance system efficiency and
reduce total costs, with uncoordinated operations leading to increased power sys-
tem stress and reduced profitability. The study emphasizes the importance of effec-
tive coordination strategies for maximizing energy utilization and achieving
financial returns in the renewable energy sector. In Ref. [69], the authors examine
the viability of coordinated EV load management for enhancing system frequency
stability in microgrids with wind power, leveraging a droop control approach.
Their findings indicate that coordinated EV load management can enable even
greater wind power penetration levels. Based on this literature, however, the
potential of EVs and power systems as controllable loads in simulation environ-
ments is highlighted, but some unresolved issues such as EV control requirements
and element responses during coordination represent significant barriers to
practical implementation and the need for continued research into effective coor-
dination strategies for maximizing the potential of RES is underscored [70].
7.3.1.2
Integration of EV with Solar Energy
The research landscape regarding the integration of solar power and EVs is con-
siderably more dynamic compared to that of wind power and EVs. Importantly,
solar power can be harnessed at both medium and low voltage levels, offering
greater flexibility within the power system. Moreover, this approach presents
opportunities for integrating PV generation with EVs, further enhancing the
potential of both technologies. These findings highlight the importance of consid-
ering a range of these RES in optimizing the functioning of EVs and the power
network as a whole. Nevertheless, the concurrent incorporation of EVs and PVs
into the power grid brings forth several challenges due to the uncertain power gen-
eration, dynamic loading conditions, and charging requirements.
In such a complicated and dynamic environment, appropriate scheduling and
control schemes are required to ensure the stability and reliability of the electric
188
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

system. Among various contributions suggesting environmentally conscious char-
ging surveyed in Ref. [71], Bessa and Matos emphasize the importance of optimiz-
ing the cost-effectiveness of EV charging during the irradiation period. On the
contrary, another valuable application is identified in Ref. [72], where the concept
of charging EVs throughout the daytime at parking spots, located in workplaces,
has been introduced. This approach enables EVs to be recharged completely
during working hours, allowing for the implementation of the solar-to-vehicle
approach. Additionally, research has shown that the energy generated in each
parking area is crucial for generating sufficient electricity to meet the transporta-
tion requirements of EV operators. These contributions shed light on the potential
of optimizing EV charging practices to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency
while reducing carbon emissions. In Ref. [73], to determine the most effective con-
figuration for meeting daily charging demands, a new solar-based grid-tied char-
ging station (SGTCS) is proposed. The proposed method is evaluated through a
techno-economic assessment that considers the technical, economic, and environ-
mental impacts of a solar-powered charging station. The model is built to account
for losses, and the results demonstrate a reduction in energy costs from $.200/kWh
to $.016/kWh, as well as a decrease in grid load of 254,030 kWh/year. It also can
support up to 7.7 charging sessions daily, using only 13% of the power supplied.
The leftover 87% can be sold back to the grid, providing a significant source of rev-
enue. The authors in Ref. [74] propose an SGTCS that maximizes the exploitation
of solar energy by optimizing the charging of EVs through an advanced scheduling
scheme. That study shows that the proposed grid-connected PV-based highway
charging station provides electricity at a cost per unit of 0.05161 $/kWh, much less
than the grid’s cost of 0.20 $/kWh. It also concludes that the PV generates 64.5% of
the power, creating 1,752,305 kWh/year. Consequently, only 34.5% of the electric-
ity is drawn from the grid to fulfill the load requirement.
7.3.2
Integration of EV with Power Grids
The growing number of electric transportation options presents new challenges to
electric energy systems, but EVs also provide significant advantages to power
networks, as depicted in Figure 7.4. Through the continued development of EV
networks, regulatory frameworks, and innovative technologies, the power grid
can become more resilient, sustainable, and reliable, meeting the energy needs
of society while reducing the environmental impact of transportation. In this
regard, successful incorporation of EVs into the power grid requires the develop-
ment of EV networks, which can contribute to mitigating harmonic distortions,
providing reactive power, reducing peak demand, and more. To fully harness
the potential of EVs, regulatory bodies specializing in EV aggregators are neces-
sary. They aggregate EVs based on their owners’ preferences to maximize business
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
189

opportunities in the electricity sector. While EVs alone may not significantly
impact the electricity industry, when coupled with energy storage systems like
accumulators, they can significantly transform it.
As global climate change intensifies, integrated electrical energy systems,
including cooling, heating, and electricity, are becoming increasingly important
[18]. The integration of these systems enables multiple components to fulfill
diverse requirements concurrently, making the incorporation of EVs essential.
The fluctuation in electrical load leads to changes in energy conversion system per-
formance, such as electric motors and boilers, further highlighting the importance
of EV adoption in integrated energy systems. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, EVs
can act as an energy storage system, helping to stabilize supply and demand. Addi-
tionally, Fattori et al. [56] examines the impact of EV penetration in electricity and
heat-integrated energy systems on a regional level. To maximize the benefits of EV
integration, numerous technical and logistical challenges must be addressed. One
significant challenge is the potential increase in harmonic distortions due to the
rapid charging of EVs. Another challenge is the difficulty in managing the high
variability and uncertainty of EV charging demand, which can lead to an unstable
power grid. To address these challenges, several academic investigations have
examined the optimal scheduling of EV charging, leveraging machine learning
techniques to predict EV charging demand, and the use of V2G technology to ena-
ble bidirectional power flow between EVs and the power grid.
Drawing on the above explanation, EV charging can be carried out using the
central power grid or the distributed renewable/non-renewable energy resources.
In the following, we review the role of EV smart charging into the distribution sys-
tems, microgrids, home and buildings, and VPP.

7.3.2.1
EV and Distribution Systems
EVs have the potential to function as a means of energy storage and supply the
required energy to both the power grid and consumers, allowing them to function
as distributed/decentralized energy units. Under such circumstances, EVs can
contribute to the reliability, stability, and flexibility of the electricity distribution
network, whenever required. The ability of EVs to store and supply energy during
peak energy demand periods can have significant benefits for the electricity distri-
bution system. During peak hours, electricity demand can exceed the available
supply, leading to strain on the distribution infrastructure and potentially result-
ing in blackouts or brownouts. By using the stored energy in EVs to supplement
the grid’s energy supply during these times, the strain on the distribution infra-
structure can be alleviated. This can help prevent costly upgrades to the infrastruc-
ture and improve the overall reliability of the electricity system. Additionally, EVs
can provide backup power to critical infrastructure during emergencies, further
enhancing the system’s resiliency. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of EVs
and the distribution network can also support the integration of RES in MES, such
as solar and wind power. These renewable sources are unpredictable, meaning
that their energy production fluctuates with weather conditions and time of
day. However, by storing excess energy from renewable sources in EVs, the supply
and demand of electricity on the grid can be balanced. This can reduce the need for
fossil fuel-powered backup generators and increase the share of renewable energy
in the electricity mix, contributing to a more sustainable energy system.
Reference [75] provides a thorough review of the modeling methods for
grid-connected EV-PV charging systems. It outlines an overall structure for
designing these systems, with a specific emphasis on incorporating smart
charging algorithms. The article also provides a comprehensive analysis of the
modeling techniques used to handle uncertainties associated with linking the
EV and PV to the grid, such as EV demand, electrical load, and PV generation.
In Ref. [76], the authors investigate the incorporation of parking depots with a
large number of EVs into distribution networks. A solution for addressing the issue
of dynamic power imbalance caused by the integration of EVs and PV systems is
proposed in a recent study referred to as Ref. [77]. The study introduces a dynamic
power balance system that models EV charging loads and PV generation in the
distribution network, allowing for investigation and mitigation of imbalanced
power flow among adjacent feeders. The aggregated EV charging loads are imple-
mented in Monte-Carlo simulation, considering several factors that may affect the
load profile. The potential role of battery-exchange stations in improving the reli-
ability level of distribution systems was studied. The authors of Ref. [78] present a
novel evaluation methodology that employs an analytical approach to provide
fresh insights into the reliability assessment of V2G strategies. This approach effec-
tively models the stochastic nature of vehicle owners’ driving behaviors and
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
191

fluctuations in system load, shedding new light on the reliability evaluation of V2G
programs.
7.3.2.2
EV and Microgrids
To reduce reliance on fossil fuels, energy managers are incorporating greater
amounts of RES into their production mix. This has led to the development of
microgrids, which consist of intermittent microgenerators as a source of energy
[32, 79]. Microgrids offer support for the smart charging of EVs, which can
improve the reliability of the energy system while optimizing energy consumption
and improving the economic aspects of energy management. By integrating EV
charging with the microgrid, EV charging can be coordinated to take advantage
of times when energy is most abundant and cheapest. In addition to their use
in supporting EV charging, microgrids also offer a range of benefits for energy
management. They can be designed to operate independently of the main power
grid, providing backup power during emergencies or blackouts. Additionally, the
incorporation of energy storage systems, such as batteries, can help to balance the
supply and demand of energy on the grid, making the microgrid more resilient to
disruptions. Moreover, microgrids can operate in a more sustainable and environ-
mentally friendly manner by utilizing RES, such as solar and wind power. This can
reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to a more sustainable energy sys-
tem. Overall, by incorporating RES, energy storage systems, and coordination with
EV charging, microgrids can provide a reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective
source of energy.
Extensive research is conducted by researchers in Ref. [80] to explore the incen-
tive schemes offered to EV owners for their participation in microgrid demand-
response mechanisms. The authors in Ref. [81] design hybrid island systems that
integrate EV parking and energy storage to decrease construction and operational
expenses, while also considering various uncertainties. The research reveals that
including EV parking in the design results in a considerable reduction in the costs
associated with energy storage installation. Ref. [82] suggests incorporating solar
PV microgrids as a means to meet the energy requirements of EV charging in
Rwanda, an East African community nation. Using the Hybrid Optimization of
Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) Grid software [83], the financial implica-
tions of a scheduled EV charging station integrated with a grid-connected solar
PV microgrid and storage are analyzed. It shows that the suggested method can
reduce the overall electricity cost by 139.7%. In Ref. [84], an incentivized energy
trading approach is introduced to study the interaction between EVs and critical
load in microgrids. EV mobility and battery degradation are studied to ensure they
do not deter EV participation. Bidder satisfaction is also introduced, which allows
EV owners to enforce their energy trading conditions. An advanced stochastic
optimization model, as detailed in Ref. [85], is devised to facilitate the control
entity in effectively managing generation and storage through precise control of
192
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

charging behavior of plug-in EVs. This study proposes a new strategy for reducing
reliability costs to achieve the lowest total cost. In this regard, the V2G tool is used
to reduce the overall system cost. The presented energy management model for the
microgrid in the grid-connected mode takes into consideration the uncertainty of
output power of WTs and PVs, as well as the EVs’ charging and discharging.
7.3.2.3
EVs and Homes/Buildings
In the near future, a significant amount of EVs is anticipated to be integrated with
residential or other buildings, enabling them to charge via either the central grid or
decentralized energy systems. Through strategic charging and discharging at suit-
able times, EVs have the potential to decrease peak demand and lower the elec-
tricity costs of smart buildings. By working in harmony with the energy system,
EVs can contribute to the total effectiveness of smart buildings and networks, max-
imizing their performance.
The authors in Ref. [86] present a multi-objective techno-economic optimization
framework in pursuit of the maximum profitability of interconnected buildings
with bilateral agreements and coordinated EV charging. The framework proposes
that primary and secondary buildings agree on a minimum contracted load and
contract tariff based on the varying load shape of the secondary building(s).
The study found that a fleet of EVs can be optimally charged through a combina-
tion of grid, solar PV, or energy storage systems at the parking station located in the
primary building. This fleet of EVs can then sell electricity to local loads in the
primary and secondary buildings, storage, and the grid, depending on their power
state, and arrival and departure times. The research results also show that the pri-
mary building can experience up to 62% daily revenue after accounting for the
deployment costs of solar, storage, and charging stations. Moreover, the secondary
buildings without solar, storage, and charging facilities can earn up to 20% cost
savings based on the nature of their bilateral agreements with the primary build-
ing. Reference [87] describes a comprehensive study of integrating EVs with
homes that have wind turbines, energy storage, and combined heat and power
generators to optimize energy consumption. The authors conducted extensive
research to explore the potential benefits of combining these technologies to
enhance energy efficiency and reduce costs.
The authors in Ref. [88] present a two-level distributed deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) algorithm that focuses on minimizing electricity costs by optimiz-
ing the scheduling of energy consumption for two controllable home appliances
(an air conditioner and a washing machine), as well as managing an ESS and
an EV charging/discharging. This algorithm ensures that the satisfaction of the
consumer and the operational features of the appliances are preserved, while
effectively reducing the overall electricity costs associated with these devices.
The comparative case studies under different weather and driving patterns of
the EV with different initial states of energy confirm that the proposed approach
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
193

can successfully minimize the cost of electricity within the consumer’s preference.
Hou et al. [89] present a comprehensive approach for scheduling various physical
equipments involved in home energy management systems (HEMS) that center on
the preferences of users. Additionally, it introduces a specially developed char-
ging/discharging approach for both ESS and EVs while taking into account their
upfront costs to incorporate them into HEMS. This strategy provides greater flex-
ibility and economic benefits and ensures that battery life is prolonged.
7.3.2.4
EV and EH
As was mentioned in Section 7.2, in the modeling of MES, an EH serves as a central
facility that efficiently manages energy supply and demand by integrating various
energy sources and carriers. This is achieved using advanced optimization algo-
rithms and control strategies, which help to balance the flow of energy across dif-
ferent sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation.
EH can incorporate different energy sources, including renewable sources like
solar, wind, and geothermal, as well as non-renewable sources like fossil fuels
and nuclear power. The integration of EV into EH requires careful energy con-
sumption management plans to maintain the demand balance. This integration
can potentially upset the equilibrium in such systems, emphasizing the impor-
tance of developing optimal strategies for managing the energy consumption of
EV within EH.
In Ref. [90], the energy management of an EH integrated with an EV is inves-
tigated. The study establishes optimal operational costs by taking into account the
thermal loads and flexible power requirements. It also involves extensive research,
and the results highlight the importance of developing strategies that ensure the
efficient use of energy resources in EH while maintaining optimal operational
costs. In Ref. [91], an optimal load dispatch form for an EH to reduce the total costs
of the EH, such as CO2 emission costs is addressed. The considered EH includes a
heat storage unit, CHP unit, PV arrays, gas boiler, wind turbine, and EV. The pro-
posed optimization algorithm models EV uncertainty via Monte Carlo simulation
and takes into account the electric and thermal demand-response (DR) schemes
extensively. It shows that the EV coordinated charge/discharge mode can reduce
the total costs by 12% compared to the uncoordinated charge mode. The results
also showed that by implementing the DR methods, the total cost can be reduced
by about 5%. In Ref. [92], research is carried out on decreasing the purchase cost
and tax of building an EH with EVs.
7.3.2.5
EV and Virtual Power Plants
A VPP is a system of distributed and moderately sized power generation facilities,
power consumers, and flexible storage systems that are aggregated and managed
as a single entity to provide grid services, such as balancing supply and demand
and providing ancillary services. The resources that make up a VPP can include
194
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

a variety of DERs, such as solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage systems
(such as batteries), and demand-response programs. These resources are con-
nected to the grid and can be controlled through a centralized platform that
enables the VPP operator to monitor and optimize their performance in real time.
The key advantage of a VPP is its ability to provide a flexible and reliable source
of power that can help to balance the grid and support the integration of intermit-
tent RES. For example, a VPP can store excess energy produced by photovoltaic
systems during daylight hours and release it during peak demand periods in the
evening, reducing the need for expensive and polluting peaking power plants.
In addition to providing grid services, VPPs can also offer benefits to energy
consumers. EVs can play a dual role in a VPP as both means of large-scale energy
storage and consumer of energy for transportation. Along with DER, EV integra-
tion into VPP contributes to both sides. Integrating EVs with VPPs contributes to
stabilizing electricity demand by compensating for instantaneous increases in
electricity consumption within a building, thus reducing the additional energy
drawn from the grid. Treating EVs as custom power devices connected to the grid
helps mitigate issues arising from the grid-to-consumer interface. Moreover, bal-
ancing electricity demand in residential areas with the use of EVs enhances grid
flexibility and reduces imbalances [93]. Leveraging EVs as virtual power plants
involves supplying electrical energy from EVs to the grid during optimal times,
offering multiple benefits in addition to charging the energy units within the
system [94].
In Ref. [95], the authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the different ways
EVs can be integrated into VPPs, including the arrangement of the system, interface
designs, marketing strategies, and future outlooks. The authors examine the inte-
gration concepts of vehicle-grid integration (VGI) in stand-alone, grid-connected,
transitional, and grid-supported operations. They also discuss VGI topologies in
terms of the types of energy generation/storage units used in EVs, as well as the
single-stage, two-stage, and hybrid-multi-stage systems employed, and the types
and parameters of grid connections. Marra et al. [96] examines the impact of
EVs on the frequency response of VPPs, as well as their potential to improve power
storage capabilities. An all-encompassing scheme for stochastic optimization is pre-
sented in Ref. [97] for the coordinated operation of a fleet of EVs with a wind power
producer (WPP) in a three-settlement pool-based market. An aggregator acquires
sufficient energy for the EVs by examining their daily driving patterns and effi-
ciently manages the stored energy to offset fluctuations in the WPP generation.
7.3.3
EV Charging/Discharging Strategies
EV fleets can offer a large storage capacity for electricity. Nevertheless, the
predominant effective charging behavior will be influenced by the energy mix
of the power grid. The integration of EVs will differ between regions where
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
195

solar-based generation is more prevalent compared to regions where wind power
is more dominant. Adopting smart charging techniques can enable EVs to serve as
a flexible resource, reducing the requirement for investment in carbon-intensive
fossil-fuel power plants. Implementing this approach promptly, it can play a sig-
nificant role in balancing renewable energy systems. Several factors can be consid-
ered when analyzing the effect of EVs on the power grid. These include the level of
EV adoption, charging strategies, characteristics of EV batteries, charging loca-
tions, charging patterns, charging times, the state of charge (SoC) of the battery,
the charging patterns of EV fleets, driving patterns of EVs, driving distances, tariff
schemes, and demand-response techniques. By examining these factors, a compre-
hensive assessment can be made of the impacts that EVs have on the power net-
work. Uncoordinated EV charging can result in the equivalent of a large electric
load, leading to higher power-system peak loads and distribution grid congestion

study reveals that unmanaged charging of EVs leads to various problems such as
increased peak load, high power losses, voltage violations, voltage unbalance,
reduction in transformer life span, and harmonic distortion. On the other hand,
it is found that smart charging can address these issues while also providing a
range of economic, social, and environmental benefits. The study emphasizes
the crucial role of smart charging in achieving zero net carbon emissions by the
transportation sector. Additionally, the research investigates the necessary policy,
regulatory frameworks, and standards required to promote the adoption of smart
charging and V2G amid EV owners and charging infrastructure designers. Such
publications provide valuable insights into these issues.
Smart charging is a flexible and adaptable approach for charging EVs that takes
into consideration both the needs of vehicle users and the conditions of the power
system. By enabling a degree of management over the EV charging procedure,
smart charging helps to integrate EVs into the power system while meeting mobil-
ity needs. This approach includes various pricing and technical charging options,
such as time-of-use pricing that encourages consumers to charge their vehicles
during off-peak periods. However, as EV penetration levels increase, more
advanced smart-charging mechanisms will be required to deliver close-to-real-
time balancing and ancillary services. The primary types of advanced smart char-
ging include V1G, V2G, V2H, and V2B, as explained in Figure 7.6. These
approaches offer various possibilities to enhance the flexibility of power systems
and facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy (VRE), such as wind
and solar PV.
Smart charging has the potential to give flexibility both at the system and local
levels, as illustrated in Figure 7.7. At the system level, smart charging can help bal-
ance the wholesale market by controlling EV charging patterns to flatten peak
demand, fill load valleys, and enable the dynamic adjustment of EV charging levels
to facilitate real-time grid balancing. V2G charging can also enable EVs to inject
electricity back into the grid, providing ancillary services to transmission system

operators. Smart charging can assist distribution system operators in managing
congestion and can also help customers manage their energy consumption,
increasing their rates of renewable power self-consumption. Overall, smart char-
ging represents an important tool for enhancing grid flexibility and enabling the
integration of RES [102].
7.3.3.1
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
Based on the previous explanation, V2X refers to the interaction between EVs,
other entities, and the infrastructure of a smart city. It can be in the form of vehi-
cle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-home (V2H), vehi-
cle-to-grid (V2G), vehicle-to-network (V2N), vehicle-to-building (V2B) or vehicle-
to-load (V2L). Regarding the interaction of EVs with the power grid, which is the
focus of this report, V2G, V2H, and V2L are considered. In this context, EVs are
considered mobile energy storage systems that can locally support the power grid
to balance supply and demand. Like battery storage systems, these technologies
can contribute to the grid by load leveling, voltage and frequency regulation,
and peak load shaving. However, several technical and economic challenges

should be solved to achieve the benefit. The viability of V2G is impacted by several
factors, including the availability of EVs, which relies on the acceptance of this
emerging technology by vehicle owners, driving habits, willingness to engage in
V2G schemes, infrastructure readiness (e.g., availability of chargers), technical
limitations (e.g., battery degradation), market preparedness, and adherence to
technical standards. V2G can provide valuable support to the grid for voltage
and frequency ancillary services, better demand-side management, compensating
for variable RES, and reducing the infrastructure upgrade cost compared to the
G2V-only cases. Indeed, the V2G technology is a flow of energy, information,
and money between the EV owners, aggregators, and the power grid to make a
stable balance between the demand and supply. Despite these opportunities,
implementing V2G has clear consequences and costs for EV owners and grid
operators, such as battery degradation, the necessity of sophisticated communica-
tion among EVs, and grid infrastructure upgrades. There are also social, political,
cultural, and technical obstacles [103]. Failure to optimally integrate V2G may
result in overloaded transformers, decreased system efficiency, and voltage and
frequency perturbations resulting in disruptive harmonics in the grid. V2G may
cause a reduction in power quality, if not well managed. It can cause voltage com-
pliance issues, harmonics, and overloading of transformers. In the past, utility
companies have typically employed devices such as voltage regulators, capacitor
banks, and transformer taps to enhance power consistency. “Flexibility” is an
important factor in EV smart charging that can be an alternative to alleviate
power-quality issues. A US study shows that average personal vehicles are engaged
in travel only 4–5% of the time during the idle hours spent in home garages or park-
ing lots throughout the day [104, 105].
V2G-enabled EVs can support the grid by frequency/voltage services, support for
intermittent solar/wind power, reactive power support, load balancing, valley fill-
ing, and peak shaving. In order to use V2G for ancillary services, we need to have a
sufficient number of V2G-enabled vehicles simultaneously connected to the power
network, which can be the case for shopping-center parking with EV chargers.
Therefore, these locations are the first candidates for V2G trials. In addition, for
V2G technology to be effective, the EV battery must possess adequate capacity
to meet travel requirements and allow for the injection of surplus energy into
the power network.
7.3.3.2
Smart Bidirectional Charging
In general, aggregators can control the charging/discharging of EVs in different
control architectures as follows:
• Centralized control approach: In an MES, the central controller would need
to balance the supply and demand of electricity from all sources, including the
changing needs of EVs. The central controller collects information from EVs
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
199

about its power requirements and communicates with each aggregator to ensure
that the appropriate amount of power is being supplied to meet the changing
needs of all EVs. Centralized charging is a type of EV charging management sys-
tem that uses a central controller to determine the timing and charging rate of
multiple EVs. Under the centralized model, the optimization of EV-charge sche-
duling is executed centrally at the aggregator level after accumulating informa-
tion about the power requirements of the EVs. The EVs can provide information
such as maximum battery capacity, state of charge (SOC), and charge rate to the
aggregator, which then contracts with the independent system operator (ISO),
based on the aggregated power requirements [106]. The ISO receives the agree-
ments from several aggregators and decides the efficient and optimal power
share for each aggregator within their agreed boundary, taking into account
other loads, generation capacity, and grid constraints. Each aggregator then
implements an optimization routine to schedule the EV charging to meet the
anticipated energy requirements of the EVs.
Centralized charging has several advantages, including improved efficiency of
the charging process, reduced stress on the power grid during peak demand per-
iods, and increased use of RES. However, it requires a high level of coordination
and communication between the central controller and the EVs, as well as a
robust and flexible charging infrastructure capable of supporting multiple
EVs charging simultaneously. It should be noted that the size of the optimiza-
tion problem will increase with the number of EVs in an area, and control archi-
tectures have been developed to address this issue by separating the loads
associated with EVs based on their geographic location, with localized control-
lers overseeing the distributed power management for different categories. This
differs from the central controller, which only controls the group’s demand
[107, 108]. In other words, centralized approaches may lose their effectiveness
and become impractical as the number of grid-connected EVs grows. Scalability
poses a significant challenge for centralized approaches, particularly as the
number of connected EVs and the planning time horizon increase, resulting
in a larger optimization problem. This can potentially make a centralized
approach computationally intractable and lead to long implementation times.
Moreover, as the quantity of variables to control and limitations for each EV
grow, the complexity of the problem increases. Additionally, the centralized
approach requires complete charging requirements and technical specification
information from EV users, which can create practical difficulties such as com-
munication bottlenecks, bandwidth limitations, and costly infrastructure expan-
sion to handle the increased data from the growing number of EVs [109].
• Decentralized control approach: In the decentralized charging method, each
EV comes equipped with its own computing capabilities and communicates its
200
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

net energy needs to an aggregator. The aggregator then utilizes this information
to determine an optimal charging schedule [110]. Decentralized control offers
numerous benefits, including scalability, enabling the scheduling process to
accommodate a large number of EVs [106]. Despite its advantages, decentralized
charging control encounters difficulties due to inadequate information at the
level of each EV. This limitation can lead to suboptimal charging schedules.
In contrast to centralized systems, decentralized systems assign individual deci-
sion-making roles to each EV, enabling them to solve their own small-scale pro-
blems independently. However, this approach does not guarantee optimal
charging schedules, particularly when complete information is unavailable at
the level of each EV. Despite the challenges, decentralized solutions are gaining
popularity because of their scalability and feasibility for implementation in the
field. In an MES, there are two types of decentralized control architectures [109].
The first type, T1, features a center-free design, with each EV locally computing
and adjusting its schedule by exchanging information with other EVs until a
global equilibrium is reached. However, this approach comes with a significant
communication overhead, especially with many EVs. In contrast, the second
type, T2, involves an indirect aggregator that gathers specific information and
transmits coordination signals to all EVs. This design significantly reduces com-
munication overheads and can handle a larger number of EVs in the scheduling
process.
Charging schemes that operate in a decentralized manner can demonstrate
greater resilience in the face of network failures, especially if the controllers
are programmed to function even when the centralized communication system
fails. In an MES, it is crucial to consider the integration of RES and the impact of
EV charging on the overall system, including other loads and grid constraints.
Decentralized control architectures should also be designed to match the grid
rules and the electricity tariff mechanisms to ensure proper integration of EV
loads with the overall system.
• Hierarchical control approach: The hierarchical control method for EV char-
ging in MESs is a strategy that involves dividing the charging process into two
levels of control. The first level is the local control level, where individual EVs
make charging decisions based on their own needs and constraints. The second
level is the global control level, where an aggregator or central controller man-
ages the charging process by coordinating the charging decisions of individual
EVs. At the local control level, each EV uses its own decision-making capability
to determine when to charge, how much to charge, and for how long. This deci-
sion is based on factors such as the battery state of charge, charging station avail-
ability, and user’s preference. The local controller communicates with the global
controller to provide information on the EV’s charging needs and constraints. At
7.3 Integration of EVs in MES
201

the global control level, the aggregator uses the information from individual EVs
to create an optimal charging schedule that takes into account the availability of
energy sources, such as renewable energy, and the constraints of the grid. The
global controller also ensures that the charging process is coordinated to avoid
overloading the grid and causing blackouts. Hierarchical control methods offer
several advantages over other control strategies. In contrast to centralized sys-
tems, hierarchical systems distribute control and computational burden among
multiple aggregators using a tree-like communication topology. This approach
minimizes the requirement for network-wide communication, as each aggrega-
tor manages a group of EVs and influences the decisions of other aggregators.
The hierarchical architecture combines the benefits of centralized and decentra-
lized architectures in a unique way, providing a balance between the two [109].
Moreover, they allow for a greater level of flexibility and responsiveness to chan-
ging conditions in the system. They can also improve the overall efficiency of the
charging process by optimizing the use of available energy sources and reducing
the risk of overloading the grid. Additionally, hierarchical control methods are
well suited for large-scale deployments of EVs, where the number of individual
EVs and charging stations is high. However, hierarchical control methods also
have some drawbacks. They can be complex to implement and require signifi-
cant computational resources to manage the charging process. The communica-
tion between the local and global controllers can also introduce delays and
increase the overall cost of the charging process. Despite these challenges, hier-
archical control methods remain a promising approach for managing the char-
ging of EVs in MES.
• Static approach: The static scheduling model for EV charging in MES is a
method of charging EVs that treats the EVs as stationary loads, ignoring their
mobility characteristics [111]. This means that the EVs are assumed to be sta-
tionary, and the charging schedule is determined without considering their
mobility patterns, such as when they will be driven and how far they will travel.
The advantage of the static scheduling model is its simplicity, which makes it
easy to formulate and solve the problem of charging multiple EVs in an MES.
However, this model lacks realism as it does not consider the dynamic nature
of EV mobility, such as changes in driving patterns or unexpected charging
needs. Therefore, it may not provide an accurate representation of the actual
charging needs of EVs in a real-world setting. Despite its limitations, the static
scheduling model can be useful for investigating the impact of other parameters
on the power grid, such as the effect of different charging rates or the use of RES
for charging. It can also be used as a baseline for comparing the performance of
other charging models that consider the mobility of EVs.
• Mobility aware approach: The mobility aware scheduling model is an
advanced method of scheduling EV charging that considers various aspects of
202
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

mobility and uncertainty associated with EVs. This approach considers factors
such as the arrival and departure times of EVs at charging stations, the trip his-
tory of EVs, and the possibility of unplanned departures. This method adds a
realistic aspect to the charging scheduling problem, making it more suitable
for real-world scenarios. By modeling the spatiotemporal behavioral traits of
EVs, the mobility aware scheduling model provides a more accurate represen-
tation of the charging load on the grid. This modeling technique can predict the
expected arrival times of EVs at charging stations and the impact of their char-
ging requests on the grid load. Such information can be used to optimize the
charging schedules, reduce the impact on the grid, and ensure efficient charging
demand management.
The utilization of intelligent V2G technology presents a robust opportunity for
demand response, resulting in decreased peak loads and improved asset utilization
within the network (i.e., relieving the network congestion and reducing network
upgrade necessity). However, customer engagement in V2G programs depends on
how the smartness of these algorithms guarantees benefits to EV owners, consid-
ering battery degradation. For example, aggregators can consider limitations for
battery availability to address the owner’s usage requirements for their EV. As a
part of its Powerloop offering, Octopus offers an application that allows customers
to input their charging schedule and receive cashback only if they fulfill a mini-
mum number of V2G sessions each month. Additionally, the application enables
customers to override V2G sessions if they choose to do so. The agreement between
Octopus and its customers guarantees a minimum battery state of charge of 30%
[112]. The inclusion of an override option is crucial as it gives EV owners a sense of
complete control, even if they choose not to use it. However, the app-based model
of EV chargers assumes a single user, which may not be ideal for households with
multiple members sharing a car. To address this limitation, some chargers, like the
Indra V2G charger used in Ovo Energy’s program, feature a boost mode that can be
activated through the app or directly via the charger’s boost button, overcoming
this issue [113]. Figure 7.8 showcases REVOLVE, the foresight optimization model
used in the Sciurus trial, capable of simulating the charging and discharging
behavior of a large number of EVs at half-hourly intervals over a year. This model
optimizes the charging and discharging behavior of individual EVs based on min-
imum cost considerations, using import and export tariffs available to the EVs. It
covers an entire year by optimizing weekly blocks one at a time. While algorithms
and programs to address owner requirements primarily fall under retail or
distribution concerns, the structure of the system that enables V2G services to
the transmission grid, involving EV owners, DNSPs, and aggregators, should be
regulated [115].

Conclusion
This chapter presents an overview of various aspects of MES and its integration
with EVs. MES is a system of integrating several energy networks, such as natural
gas, transportation, and electricity distribution networks, to promote efficient
energy use. EVs are a component of MESs and their integration into the MESs
is important because changes in electricity load resulting from the adoption of
EVs can affect the operation of energy conversion systems such as CHP systems,
gas-fired generators, boilers, and others. To balance the supply and demand of
energy, EVs can be used as energy storage systems in MES as they provide an
opportunity for sustainable transport and decarbonization of the transport sector.
The increased use of EVs for charging and routing will have a significant impact on
the energy management of EH and stations. This chapter reviews original research
works related to modeling, management, and intelligent controls of MESs inte-
grating EV routing and charging. In light of the knowledge acquired through this
review, the challenges as well as positive and negative effects of integrating EV
within MES can be summarized as follows:
Challenges of integrating EVs within MES:

structure is a key challenge. This includes deploying various types of charging

strategic locations to meet the charging needs of different types of EVs. Build-
ing and maintaining the charging infrastructure can be capital-intensive and
require coordination with multiple stakeholders, including utilities, local
authorities, and charging equipment manufacturers.
• Grid integration: The integration of EVs with the electric grid requires careful
planning and coordination to manage the increased demand for electricity.
The charging of a large number of EVs simultaneously can cause load peaks,
leading to grid instability, voltage fluctuations, and potential grid overloading.
Grid upgrades may be necessary to handle the increased demand, and
advanced grid management techniques, such as demand response, load shift-
ing, and smart grid technologies, may need to be employed to ensure smooth
integration.
• Energy management and optimization: Effective energy management and
optimization strategies are crucial for integrating EVs within MESs. This
includes scheduling the charging and discharging of EVs to align with renew-
able energy generation, grid demand, and other energy sources. Advanced
energy management systems, including predictive analytics, machine learn-
ing algorithms, and optimization algorithms, may be required to optimize
energy flows, storage, and distribution among various energy systems within
the MES.
• Interoperability and standardization: Interoperability and standardization of
EV-charging equipment, communication protocols, and data formats are crit-
ical for seamless integration. Lack of standardization can lead to compatibility
issues, hinder interoperability, and limit the effectiveness of integrating EVs
with other energy systems. The adoption of common standards, such as the
Open Charge Point Interface and the Open Charge Point Protocol, can facil-
itate interoperability and simplify integration.
• Cost and economic viability: The cost of integrating EVs within MESs can be a
significant challenge. It includes the initial costs of setting up charging sta-
tions, grid upgrades, and energy management systems, as well as ongoing
operational and maintenance costs. Economic viability needs to be carefully
evaluated, considering factors such as capital costs, operational costs, reve-
nue-generation potential, and return on investment to ensure the sustainabil-
ity of the integrated system.
Positive Effects of integrating EVs within MESs:
• Renewable energy integration: EVs can act as energy storage devices, enabling
better integration of intermittent RES like solar and wind power. EVs can
charge during times of excess renewable energy generation, store the energy
in their batteries, and discharge it during periods of high demand or low
renewable energy availability, helping to balance the grid and increase the
utilization of renewable energy. This can contribute to reduced reliance on
fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
7.4 Conclusion
205

• Demand-side management: EVs can be used for demand-side management by
scheduling their charging/discharging to align with grid demand and other
energy systems. This can help optimize energy consumption, reduce peak
loads, and lower electricity costs by charging during off-peak hours or when
renewable energy generation is high, thereby reducing strain on the grid.
Advanced energy management techniques, such as V2G technology, can ena-
ble bidirectional power flow between EVs and the grid, allowing EVs to serve
as a flexible load or a source of energy to support grid stability.
• Reduced emissions: EVs are known for their zero tailpipe emissions, which
can aid in the reduction of air pollution and the mitigation of greenhouse
gas emissions. When integrated into MESs powered by RES, EVs can contrib-
ute to improved air quality and mitigated climate change impacts.
• Increased energy efficiency: MESs can optimize energy use by integrating EVs
into the overall energy management strategy. For example, EVs can be
charged during periods of excess renewable energy generation, thereby utiliz-
ing surplus energy that would otherwise be wasted. Additionally, EVs can
recover and store energy during regenerative braking, which can increase
the overall energy efficiency of the transportation system and reduce energy
waste.
• Diversification of energy sources: Integrating EVs within MESs can diversify
energy sources and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. EVs can be charged
from various energy sources, including renewable energy, grid electricity,
and on-site generation such as solar panels, allowing for a more diverse
and distributed energy supply. This can enhance energy security and resil-
ience, reducing the reliance on a single energy source and providing flexibility
in the energy supply chain.
Negative Effects of integrating EVs within MESs:
• Grid overloading and instability: The increased demand for electricity from
charging multiple EVs simultaneously can strain the electric grid and lead
to overloading and instability. This can cause voltage fluctuations, grid con-
gestion, and potential disruptions in energy supply. Grid upgrades and
advanced grid management techniques may be required to address these chal-
lenges and ensure grid stability.
• Complex energy management and control: Integrating EVs within MESs
requires sophisticated energy management and control strategies. Coordinat-
ing the charging and discharging of EVs, aligning with renewable energy
generation and grid demand, optimizing energy flows, and maintaining
energy balance among various energy systems can be complex and challeng-
ing. Advanced energy management systems and expertise in optimizing
206
7 Integration of Electric Vehicles into Multi-energy Systems

multi-energy systems may be required, which can increase operational com-
plexities and costs.
• Cost and return on investment: The initial setup costs of charging infrastruc-
ture, grid upgrades, and energy management systems can be significant, and
the return on investment may not be immediate. It may take time to recover
the costs through revenue generation from charging services or other
mechanisms. The economic viability of integrating EVs within MESs needs
to be carefully evaluated to ensure sustainability and financial feasibility.
• Interoperability and standardization challenges: Lack of interoperability and
standardization among different EV charging equipment, communication
protocols, and data formats can hinder seamless integration. Incompatibility
issues can result in limitations in interoperability, data exchange, and system
efficiency. Adoption of common standards and protocols across different sta-
keholders and technologies may be necessary to overcome these challenges.
• Technology and infrastructure limitations: The current technology and infra-
structure for EVs, including charging stations, battery capacity, and charging
speed, are still evolving and may have limitations. This includes challenges
such as limited charging station availability in certain areas, long charging
times for some types of EVs, and limited battery capacity for long-distance
travel. These limitations can impact the convenience and practicality of using
EVs within MESs.
Based on the information provided in this chapter, some potential recommen-
dations related to modeling, management, and intelligent controls of MESs inte-
grating EV routing and charging can be concluded as follows:
• Develop more comprehensive and accurate models for MESs that integrate EV
routing and charging. These models should consider various factors such as
energy demand, energy supply, energy storage, and the behavior of EVs, as well
as the interactions between these factors.
• Design and implement effective management strategies for MESs that can han-
dle the improved utilization of charging patterns of EVs. These strategies should
aim to balance the energy supply and demand of the entire system, minimize
energy waste, and ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the system.
• Use intelligent control techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine
learning to optimize the performance of MESs. These techniques can help to
predict energy demand and supply, optimize energy generation and storage,
and improve the overall efficiency and reliability of the system.
• Develop and test new technologies for energy conversion, storage, and distribu-
tion that can better integrate with EVs. This could include the development of
new battery technologies, energy storage systems that can be integrated with
7.4 Conclusion
207

EVs, and smart charging systems that can better coordinate the charging of mul-
tiple EVs.
• Conduct more research on the social, economic, and environmental impacts of
MESs integrating EV routing and charging. This research should focus on the
potential benefits and challenges of these systems, as well as the trade-offs
between different design and operation strategies. This information can help
policymakers and stakeholders make informed decisions about the development
and deployment of these systems.

Self-Driving Vehicle Systems in Intelligent
Transportation Networks

Introduction
Self-driving vehicles consist of intelligent sub-systems that are capable of driving
themselves entirely or in part for reducing pollution and traffic problems along
with safety purposes. While numerous technological breakthroughs have made
significant progress in the development of more capable vehicles, the technology
is not yet perfect and the complete elimination of human intervention remains a
challenge. Furthermore, public reservations and psychological barriers associated
with the use of driverless vehicles raise concerns regarding trust in personal safety
and security [1].
In the near future, there is a strong possibility that fully autonomous vehicles
(AVs) will become the dominant component of intelligent transportation net-
works, replacing human drivers. This has sparked intense competition among
major car manufacturers and technology companies, as they strive to be the first
to introduce fully self-driving vehicles to the market. However, experts suggest that
the transition to fully autonomous technology and its widespread adoption may
not occur until around 2030 due to the aforementioned limitations [2]. Intelligent
vehicles have a set of complicated systems that use data coming from sensors to
identify the environment and generate appropriate behaviors for subsequent
actions [3]. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has classified AVs based
on their level of intelligence from zero to five. Basically, level 0 means no automa-
tion, while level 5 refers to full automation. The detailed functionality of the SAE
levels is given in Table 8.1.

The acceleration of computing methodologies has reshaped mobility and
enabled the development of promising technologies and practical applications
for self-driving vehicles. These key methodologies, which support making vehicles
move from level 0 to level 5, primarily involve sensing, perception, and planning/
control, which will be elaborated upon in the following sections.
The motivation behind studying autonomous and intelligent vehicle systems
arises from the potential to address pressing challenges in modern transportation,
including pollution reduction, traffic congestion alleviation, energy consumption
minimization, and safety enhancement. With the rapid advancement of vehicle
technology and the increasing complexity of these systems, it becomes crucial to
comprehend the underlying components and their integration into intelligent trans-
portation networks. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the state
of the art in AV research, with a specific focus on key areas such as sensing tech-
nologies, perception techniques (e.g., object detection and tracking, lane tracking,
traffic sign detection, vehicle and pedestrian detection), simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), and planning and control strategies [5–7]. By examining
the latest advancements in these areas, this work seeks to establish a solid founda-
tion for further research and innovation, ultimately contributing to the development
of AVs and their seamless integration into future transportation systems.

Brief History
Self-driving vehicle systems with rapid developments in sensor and computing
technologies are an active research area aimed at making the components work
in harmony for safe driving. However, autonomous-based vehicles and driving
technologies are not a new field; they date back to two decades. One of the first
self-sufficient attempts, called Navlab, appeared at Carnegie Mellon University

8 Self-Driving Vehicle Systems in Intelligent Transportation Networks

in the 1980s, combining image processing, neural networks, and control [8]. The
European EUREKA project “Prometheus,” launched in 1986, has demonstrated
the usability of fully autonomous driving on the highway near Paris [9]. By the
mid-1990s, the ARGO Project was announced with the aim of developing an active
safety system for fully AV technology [10]. By the early 2000s, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued a challenge that accelerated
the research for autonomous driving. In the first year, no vehicle finished the race.
A year later, Stanford’s racing team won the challenge [11]. In 2010, Google
announced the prototype of a car with self-driving capability. The company has
also revealed that the developed car has logged 500,000 miles in autonomous mode
with no crashes [12]. In 2014, Tesla, the electric car company, integrated autopilot
with advanced driver-assistance system features into Model S, which makes it one
of the most advanced autonomous cars in the market [13]. When it comes to the
2020s, the increasing focus is not only on autonomous personal cars but also on
AVs in public transportation. HONDA, the well-known Japanese car company,
introduced a limited number of Legend Hybrid EX models with hands-free driving
functioning [14]. Mercedes integrated the conditional self-driving system into the
S-Class series that is currently legally used in Germany [15]. EasyMile, a commer-
cial autonomous shuttle bus manufacturer, introduced the first-ever Level 4 serv-
ice model on public roads [16]. KARSAN automotive, one of the leading electric
bus manufacturers, launched the commercial autonomous bus called “Autono-
mous e-Atak,” which is capable of following the traffic signs while driving on
urban lines without the need for driver control [17]. A concise overview of the
advancements in autonomous vehicles is presented in Figure 8.1.

Literature Review
The rapid advancement of autonomous and intelligent vehicle systems has led to a
wealth of research spanning various domains. The increasing complexity of these
systems necessitates a deeper understanding of their components and the chal-
lenges associated with their integration into existing transportation networks. This
extended literature review delves into key areas of research, highlighting their
importance in the development and deployment of AVs [18].
Sensing and perception form the foundation of AV systems. A wide range of sen-
sors, including cameras, lidar, and radar, have been investigated and implemented
to provide a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle’s surroundings [19]. Lidar-
based object tracking systems have been proposed for AVs, emphasizing the impor-
tance of accurate and reliable perception [20]. Cooperative maneuvering in mixed
urban traffic has been studied, highlighting the role of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) com-
munication and the combination of various sensor data for safe and efficient driving
[21]. Additionally, the fusion of data from multiple sensors, such as cameras, lidar,
and radar, has been explored to improve the robustness and reliability of AV per-
ception systems [22, 23]. Furthermore, semantic scene understanding, which
involves recognizing and interpreting the context of objects and scenes detected
by sensors, has been explored to support more informed decision-making by AVs
[24]. A probabilistic planner for AVs has been developed, allowing for robust nav-
igation in complex, dynamic environments [25]. Machine learning techniques,
including deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL), have been applied to
develop adaptive control algorithms that enable AVs to handle various driving sce-
narios more effectively [26]. Model predictive control (MPC) has been employed for
trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance, providing a framework that considers
the vehicle’s dynamics and constraints while optimizing its trajectory [27]. In addi-
tion, game theory has been applied to analyze interactions between AVs and other
road users, enabling the development of decision-making algorithms that account
for the strategic behavior of multiple agents in the driving environment [28]. Swarm
intelligence, inspired by the collective behavior of social insects, has been explored
as a means to optimize the coordination and decision-making processes of con-
nected AVs in large-scale transportation systems [29].
8.4
Advantages and Challenges
One of the key advantages of self-driving vehicles lies in their capacity to enhance
safety on the roads. Given that human error represents a predominant factor con-
tributing to accidents, AVs can address this concern through the utilization of
advanced sensors, algorithms, and control systems, enabling them to make precise
220
8 Self-Driving Vehicle Systems in Intelligent Transportation Networks

and prompt decisions surpassing those made by human drivers [30]. Despite the
numerous advantages of AVs, the deployment of these vehicles also faces several
challenges that need to be addressed before their full potential can be realized.
One of the primary advantages of self-driving vehicles is the potential for
increased safety on the roads. Human error is a leading cause of accidents, and
AVs can mitigate this risk by utilizing advanced sensors, algorithms, and control
systems to make more accurate and timely decisions than human drivers [31].
Additionally, AVs have the potential to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions and air pollution. Through optimized routing, reduced traffic con-
gestion, and facilitating smoother traffic flow, AVs can help to minimize environ-
mental impact [32]. Moreover, integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into the AV fleet
further enhances the environmental benefits, as EVs produce zero tailpipe emis-
sions [33, 34]. Furthermore, AVs have the promising capability to enhance mobil-
ity for individuals facing transportation challenges, such as the elderly, disabled, or
those without access to personal transportation [35]. By providing reliable and
accessible transportation options, AVs can improve the quality of life for these
individuals and promote social inclusion.
In addition to the advantages, the development of fully AVs necessitates the use of
sophisticated hardware and software systems that can reliably operate in complex
and dynamic environments. Achieving high levels of reliability and performance
for these systems remains a significant technical challenge [36]. Furthermore, the
successful deployment of AVs requires the establishment of comprehensive legal,
regulatory, and ethical frameworks, developed through collaboration among policy-
makers, industry stakeholders, researchers, and consumer advocacy groups [37, 38].
These frameworks should address various challenges unique to self-driving vehicles,
including liability, insurance, data privacy, cybersecurity, and ethical decision-
making. Striking a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring public safety
is essential for the effective integration of AVs into society.
8.5
Sensing
AVs are equipped with several fundamental sensors to perceive their surround-
ings. The quality of these sensors plays a critical role in implementing Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by providing input data for interpretation [39].
Given that each sensor has its own strengths and limitations, the use of a multi-
sensor configuration enables AVs to mitigate undesired weaknesses in the system
while driving. Certain sensors are essential for increasing the autonomy level of
vehicles from one to five, with frequently utilized sensors including GNSS, lidar,
camera, and radar [40].
GNSS, or Global Navigation Satellite System, serves as the AV’s navigation sys-
tem by providing precise location positioning anywhere on Earth. It is a vital
8.5 Sensing
221

component that assists in SLAM, improving the estimation of the vehicle’s posi-
tion within the surrounding environment. GNSS is also commonly employed in
ADAS to determine the global location of the vehicle [41].
Lidar, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a robust component for
autonomous driving primarily utilized for object detection, mapping, and ranging.
By scanning the environment, lidar can detect objects and generate a detailed 3D
point cloud map of the surroundings. This is achieved by emitting pulsed laser
waves that are reflected by objects, providing information about static and
dynamic environments. However, it is important to note that lidar can be relatively
expensive and sensitive to harsh weather conditions [42, 43].
Camera serves as a visual sensor that captures the surrounding environment,
providing a visual representation of the world in color. It is capable of detecting
obstacles, objects, traffic signs, and road markings. Many AV applications employ
multiple cameras along with image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) algo-
rithms to classify detected objects statistically. To enhance the vehicle’s perspec-
tive, cameras are typically positioned at the front, back, and wing mirrors of the
vehicle. While cameras have a lower cost compared to lidar, they are susceptible
to changes in illumination and cannot provide distance information [43].
Radar, or Radio Detection and Ranging, emits radio waves that are reflected
back from obstacles, allowing for the measurement of size and distances. This
enables the acquisition of collision avoidance, distance, and velocity information.
Radar can detect objects with high precision, depending on the speed at which the
waves propagate. One advantage of radar is its ability to provide high resolution
even in adverse weather conditions with limited visibility. However, radar cannot
precisely determine the shape of objects like cameras can.
The use of multiple sensors directly impacts the sensing capabilities of AVs and
is crucial for safety-related tasks. Sensor fusion is a framework that involves the
cooperative integration of two or more diverse sensors to leverage their respective
advantages, as illustrated in Figure 8.2. Since delivering all the necessary informa-
tion for AVs with a single sensor type is challenging, an appropriate sensor fusion
framework becomes essential to achieve higher levels of autonomy, particularly in
perception, and gain a comprehensive understanding of the surrounding environ-
ment [44]. Consequently, there is an increased demand for an appropriate frame-
work that facilitates a higher level of autonomy, particularly in perception, to gain
a comprehensive understanding of the surrounding environment. This multi-
sensor approach not only enhances the accuracy and reliability of the collected data
but also provides redundancy, ensuring system operation even if one sensor fails or
encounters limitations [45]. Integrating diverse sensor modalities, such as lidar,
camera, and radar, offers a more holistic representation of the environment,
enabling AVs to better comprehend and respond to dynamic situations. Ultimately,
the fusion of data from multiple sensors is crucial for developing robust and reliable
AV systems capable of navigating complex environments safely and efficiently.

8.6
Perception
After sensing, the data received from sensors are fed into the perception stage for
processing in order to gather useful and consistent information about the surround-
ing environment. The whole process is called perception, which is one of the main
modules of the AV systems. It is essential to note that perception plays a key role in
the decision-making of AVs [46]. This section will review the fundamental aspects of
detection and tracking that are frequently faced in many applications.
8.6.1
Object Detection and Tracking
Each perception module has to accomplish a particular task to ensure the effi-
ciency and stability of the overall AV system for road safety. However, an intelli-
gent system can sometimes be manipulated, resulting in potential damage and
collision due to missed detections and wrong tracking results.
Semantic Segmentation, a vital component of perception in AVs, goes beyond
object detection and tracking to provide a more detailed understanding of the envi-
ronment. It involves assigning semantic labels to individual pixels or regions in an
image, enabling the vehicle to differentiate between different objects and their
respective classes, such as pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles [47]. By leveraging
advanced computer vision techniques, such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), semantic segmentation enhances the perception capabilities of self-
driving vehicles by providing a fine-grained analysis of the scene [48]. This addi-
tional level of understanding enables more precise decision-making, leading to
improved safety and performance. Integrating semantic segmentation with other
perception modules, such as object detection and tracking, can further enhance
the overall perception capabilities of AVs.
Lane Tracking is essential for AV perception and should be robust to a variety of
driving environments. It is the process that detects lines on the roads and

continually monitors the position of the vehicle within a lane for safe driving.
Many vehicles have implemented this feature over the decades. One of the
first implementations was started by Stanford Research Institute’s Artificial Intel-
ligence Center in the early 1980s [49]. In 2006, the DARPA urban challenge made
it possible to operate many vehicles with the lane tracking system [11]. Currently,
this system is adapted to advanced vehicles with a high degree of safety. It should
be noted that the figure of the lane tracking can be seen in Figure 8.3.
Traffic Sign Detection is a useful application for ADAS, which recognizes traffic
signs on the road. It is important to highlight that successful sign detection can
contribute to safer and easier driving. However, it can sometimes be challenging
to detect signs accurately due to the presence of other objects and light reflections.
This system plays a crucial role in alerting the driver in case a sign is missed. The
detection of traffic signs on roads has been extensively studied by researchers and
engineers, and its performance relies on various computer vision and AI techni-
ques. The performance of this system capable of reading and classifying road signs
depends on the success of several computer vision and AI techniques [50]. A vast
majority of existing approaches have been proposed to perform the system in many
kinds of adverse situations [51]. Some of the applications of traffic sign detection
can be seen in Figure 8.4.
Vehicle/Pedestrian Detection is a critical technology for object detection in a
traffic scene and many of the techniques are based on deep learning. You
Only Look Once (YOLO), MultiBox Detector (SSD), and Region-based Convo-
lutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) are among the most recognized algori-
thms in the literature [52–55]. Detecting vehicles and pedestrians can be
challenging due to their unpredictable behaviors in traffic. The system

should be capable of recognizing them regardless of their pose or shape. Addi-
tionally, providing timely visual or voice warnings can help prevent many dan-
gerous situations. The figure of the aforementioned system can be seen in
Figure 8.5.

8.6.2
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
SLAM is a method that is able to explore the environment without any prior
knowledge and localize itself within it while moving. The goal of SLAM is to effec-
tively perform localization and mapping simultaneously by utilizing sensors [56].
Accurate localization not only provides the absolute position of AV, but also deter-
mines how far the vehicle is from its surrounding objects [57]. Mapping is essential
for AV to visualize an unknown environment, as well as assist in building the path
of AV for navigation [58]. The basic representation of SLAM is given in Figure 8.6.
SLAM technology can be divided into two categories, visual SLAM and lidar
SLAM, according to sensor types, such as camera and Lidar [56]. SLAM, depend-
ing on visual information, is called visual SLAM (vSLAM) [59]. The technical dif-
ficulty of vSLAM can be higher than that of lidar SLAM due to the limited field of
view, but it can be less expensive than that of lidar-based systems. The early devel-
opment stage of vSLAM using a monocular camera dates back to the 2000s, which
is called the feature-based approach. Besides, a direct approach is proposed to deal
with a whole image directly for textureless or featureless environments [60].
MonoSLAM, a filter-based algorithm, can be an example of feature-based
approaches developed in 2003 [61]. The algorithm is utilized by an extended
Kalman filter to use camera motion and 3D structure of an unknown environment
simultaneously. Parallel tracking and mapping (PTAM) has been proposed and
provides less computational cost by using different threads on the CPU in parallel
[62]. Dense tracking and mapping (DTAM) is the direct approach based on the
dense 3D surface model for camera tracking via whole image registration [63].
Lidar-based SLAM technology is one of the popular methods in robotics and
AVs. It is arguably more sophisticated but less complex than classical visual

SLAMs [64]. One of the key issues in this technology is the point cloud registration
process. Regarding this problem, the standard iterative closest point (ICP) algo-
rithm is generally used for aligning two surfaces of scans [65]. The extended
ICP algorithm is also proposed to estimate the continuous-time trajectory for
SLAM from actuated lidar [66]. More and more algorithms have been developed
to solve the drawbacks of existing ones [67, 68].
8.7
Planning and Control
The planning and Control mechanism needs feedback from environmental repre-
sentation supported by mapping and localization. The architecture of the process
basically consists of route planning, behavioral planning, and motion planning.
Route planning refers to the process of determining the road network from the
current location to the destination that the vehicle will reach. It is important due to
the direct effect on the decisions of the vehicle in finding the optimal path. It can be
classified into two strategies: global and local route planning [69]. Global route
planning is the first step of the navigation task, which is mainly aimed at finding
the most optimal and safe route for the vehicle to reach its destination. Local route
planning mainly addresses to navigate the vehicle safely by determining a precise
path at tactical level, such as obstacle avoidance. This strategy considers driving
conditions, such as obstacles and road boundaries, as well as instantaneous factors,
such as vehicle movement, dynamic objects, and generates candidate paths ensur-
ing driving safety [70]. There are some popular methods for route planning, such
as Dijkstra [71] and A∗[72] approaches. Dijkstra is an algorithm that allows us to
find the shortest path from a starting point to a target point on a map. A∗combines
the principles of Dijkstra’s algorithm with the heuristic function to provide a faster
solution in reaching the shortest path between an initial point and a final point
on a map. The comparative survey of the routing algorithms can also be found
in Ref. [73]. An example of the route planning can be found in Figure 8.7.
Behavioral planning, which is essentially responsible for decision-making,
focuses on determining driving actions that the vehicle should take along the route
planned in the previous layer according to the information of traffic, static, and
dynamic objects provided by the perception layer [74]. This layer can also make
a decision among the candidate paths; thus, it can work with local route planning
in parallel. Mainly, the proposed approaches in behavior planning include motion
prediction and decision-making [75].
Regarding motion prediction, the improved event data recorder has been pro-
posed for driving safety. The driver-behavior models have been developed based
on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to determine automatically safe and risky
8.7 Planning and Control
227

driving behavior from the recorded driving data. The proposed system is able to
give the driver a suitable response/warning under some circumstances [76].
Quantum Markov decision process (QMDP) with Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS) has also been offered to avoid risky behavior. The outcomes demonstrate
how input uncertainty can be propagated to estimate uncertainty in the output of
candidate maneuvers [77]. Driving behavior has been realized by constructing
state-action mapping rules in which fuzzy logic partition sets and fuzzy driving
rules have been benefited, and are then embedded into a neural network struc-
ture that models two types of driving behavior: car-following behavior and eva-
sive behavior [78]. AI techniques have been commonly used in the literature to
predict accidents by building models [79]. Artificial neural network (ANN) is one
of the examples that was used for the detection of possible accidents. The number
of data collected from complex traffic and geometrical characteristics including
52,447 crash cases has been used to build the ANN model by selecting 25 inde-
pendent variables. The results show that the multilayer perceptron models
obtain better outcomes [80]. In another study, 77,800 complete accident data
have been used for the development of ANN models that benefited from the sig-
moid activation function. According to the results, the most important parameter
that influences the number of accidents on highways is the degree of vertical cur-
vature [81]. Temporal difference (TD) learning is a technique that is frequently
used in RL to predict the future reward [82]. Several frameworks have been pro-
posed to detect unsafe driving behavior by using TD learning in RL. An approach
to learn a danger level function to be used as an alert to the users in advance of
dangerous situations has been proposed. TD learning has been used to obtain the
approximation by propagating the penalty/reward observable under some con-
straints [83]. Interested readers can also find RL-based methods in behavior pla-
nning architecture in Ref. [84].

Regarding decision-making, a solution to real-time decision-making has
been proposed. The proposed method is divided into two parts: the former is
for safety-critical tasks, while the latter addresses non-safety-critical driving.
A multiple criteria decision-making model is built for the second decision-making
part and the performance of the model is compared with the existing solutions.
The results illustrate that the developed model presents several benefits [85].
A technique has been presented for the planning of future trajectories regarding
dynamic obstacles for AVs. The proposed technique utilizes an optimization algo-
rithm to simultaneously optimize multiple continuous contingency paths [86]. An
evolutionary-based trajectory planning technique has been proposed for AVs in
traffic. The presented structure is able to navigate the vehicle in several scenarios
including a large number of obstacles in a predefined map for correct decision-
making [87]. RL-based methods have also been used for the decision-making
process in AVs. Curriculum learning has been presented to facilitate the learning
process of the model by training on easy tasks and continuously increasing the
complexity of the tasks introduced to the learning agent [88]. Reverse curriculum
generation for RL has been proposed without any prior knowledge. This technique
generates a curriculum of starting positions that adapts to the agent’s performance
for difficult simulated navigation problems [89]. In another study, building the
model for a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) allows the
algorithm to consider uncertainties of the decision-making process. It can draw
the robust characteristics for perception inputs [90]. The aforementioned RL-
based algorithms have been ineffective in continuous tasks, such as the control
of the acceleration, braking, and steering actions. To overcome this, the study
has presented a framework to implement continuous actions in which an agent
is trained exclusively with deep RL [91]. The hierarchical RL structure has also
been proposed including a heuristic-based rules-enumeration policy and applied
to the decision-making part of AVs. The presented structure is able to generate
continuous actions by using the hybrid RL and heuristic techniques [92].

Introduction
The current transportation sector is based on conventional vehicles, increasing the
danger of destroying the environment through global warming. The latest studies
focus on finding an alternative solution that eliminates fossil fuel use in vehicles.
Electric vehicles are considered the most promising solution in the automotive
industry. There are several EV technologies, including hybrid electric vehicles
(HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
(PHEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) [1].
These EVs generally are taken as a means of storage of the battery pack and the
ultracapacitor with a possible collaboration of fuel cells [2]. The operating system
of EVs relies on the fact that the wheels of the vehicle are driven by the rotational
power provided by the electric motor. FCEVs may become more prevalent in the
transportation sector if investments in refueling stations continue to increase
(Odabaş, İ. H., Akca 2020). Fuel cells can be classified into several categories
according to different criteria, such as their chemical properties and operating
temperature [3].
The automotive industry is making a great effort to find a compatible solution to
keep pace with market demands with minimal emissions of climate-destroying
substances. Among the most promising solutions, in this case, are pure BEV,
FCEV, and HEV [4]. Indeed, BEVs have a particular system that eliminates using
a traditional internal combustion engine and instead requires an additional
(external) source to recharge the battery. Regarding FCEV, it can play the role
of a battery or an internal combustion engine, depending on the power system.
It produces electrical energy through a chemical process that resembles the battery
system. At the same time, it can operate as an internal combustion engine in the
case of the adoption of hydrogen as fuel [5]. HEVs rely on several storage sources to
provide sufficient electricity for electric propulsion, whether by integrating bat-
teries, fuel cells, or internal combustion engines [6]. FCEV and FCHEV vehicles
generally rely on hybridization between fuel cells, rechargeable batteries, and
ultracapacitors because the existence of the latter two ensures sufficient energy
to provide the necessary power. The storage system is the most influential factor
in the efficiency and range of hybrid vehicles, as it enables energy to be stored and
quickly released as needed [7]. In the case of South Korea, for example, the number
of FCEVs in 2017 increased five times more compared to 2015 [8]. The brushless
motor has become popular in the automotive industry due to its high-performance
and well-developed control system. There are many technologies to control this
motor, of which this chapter presents three widespread control modes: PI control-
ler, PID controller, and fuzzy logic controller. The work presented in this chapter
provides a concrete study of energy storage systems used in electric vehicles (fuel
cells and batteries). Several car manufacturers, such as Toyota and Honda, have
238

adopted the BLDC engine due to its high efficiency, hence the importance of this
work, which also focuses on modeling and controlling a BLDC engine designed for
electric vehicles.
The first part of this chapter examines a study on the different types of fuel cells,
highlighting their role in the development of electric cars. Furthermore, the sec-
ond section presents the new battery technologies used in electric vehicles and
their corresponding characteristics. In the end, the section examines the different
control strategies of the brushless motor applied to EVs.
9.2
Fuel Cell
The fuel cell consists mainly of three components: the anode, the cathode, and the
electrolyte. The anode’s “oxidation” phase occurs, where hydrogen is oxidized into
protons and electrons. On the other hand, at the cathode, the “reduction” phase
takes place where oxygen is reduced to produce heat and water [9, 10].
½ O2 + 2H+ + 2e−
H2O + Electricity + Heat
The operating principle of this battery is based on hydrogen reacting with oxy-
gen in the air. In the internal combustion engine system, for example, energy is
released in the form of heat. In contrast, the fuel cell is an electrochemical reaction
that provides electrical power and heat [2, 11]. In fact, these batteries sometimes
play the role of a lifesaver; for example, in remote and rural areas, it is a significant
source of energy, especially in the unavailability of public networks or when the
costs of wiring and power supply are frequent.
In Ref. [12], a comparison between fuel cell (FC) and various power generation
technologies in Table 9.1 shows a high efficiency compared to other sources

(including diesel, turbogenerator, and wind turbine). Therefore, using hydrogen as
a reagent offers better skills and, above all, a cleaner environment.
9.2.1
Types of Fuel Cells
There are currently several types of FC, of which the main ones are six categories
[13]: proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), phosphoric acid fuel cell
(PAFC), alkaline fuel cell (AFC), molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), solid oxide
fuel cell (SOFC), and direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). These cells are generally
classified according to the fuel type, the degree of operating temperature, and the
chemical characteristics of the electrolyte [14]. In addition, the most widely used
FCs today are PEMFCs and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) [15].
9.2.1.1
Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell
PEM is characterized by the exploitation of a solid polymer electrolyte which is
considered as an ideal conductor and its role of insulation for electrons. The
operating temperature of PEMs is typically 70 C–80 C, although this margin
changes in the case of the automotive sector, where this temperature varies
between 120 C and 150 C [16]. Furthermore, PEMFCs are considered the most
promising fuel cell technology due to their high competence, including fast start-
up technique, ability to perform many thermal cycles, low-operating tempera-
ture, and hydrogen conversion efficiency. Indeed, the most common use of PEMs
is in the fields of transport and portable power generation. The application of
PEMs in the transport sector (cars, buses, etc.) has increased in recent decades
due to the high and unstable price of fossil fuels, the unavailability of fuel to meet
needs, and the global consensus on the need to find an alternative to fossil fuels
in the automotive sector to reduce CO2 emissions [16, 17]. Actually, the introduc-
tion of these types of fuel cells in vehicles (FCV) has been incredibly successful in
recent times, including the 2017 Toyota Mirai car, which has a power density of
3.1 kW/L and a fuel cell stack that reaches 114 kW, and Hyundai’s Hyundai
Tucson model [18].
Indeed, fuel cell buses present a perfect solution that continues to grow in the
market as this type of car has safe and convenient hydrogen storage compared to
other vehicles. The challenges facing PEMS remain an obstacle to its adaptation
in other fields. Among these disadvantages are the low efficiency, which varies
between 40% and 45%, and the high cost of the platinum catalyst used in construct-
ing PEMs. Furthermore, a study in Ref. [19] concluded that the significant chal-
lenges of PEMs are the high cost for most applications, the low sustainability,
and the non-existence of a hydrogen infrastructure. Therefore, Figure 9.1 repre-
sents the descriptive diagram of the PEM fuel cell.

9.2.1.2
Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC)
Over the past decades, there has been a lot of research into developing PAFCs in
various fields, such as electrochemical systems and the transport sector. The PAFC
is characterized by a liquid electrolyte (phosphoric acid) compared to the DMFC
and PEM. In the case of PAFCs, liquid phosphoric acid acts as the electrolyte,
while hydrogen is considered the fuel [20]. It is necessary to mention that the oper-
ating temperature of PAFCs is higher than that of alkaline fuel cells and proton
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, as PAFCs have an operating temperature
that varies between 150 C and 220 C. The principle of operation is characterized
by the movement of electrons and protons in succession to produce electrical cur-
rent and heat. These types of fuel cells are mainly used in the stationery and trans-
port sectors.
Moreover, PAFCs offer the option of cogeneration through the effect of their
high-operating temperature to produce electrical energy and heat simultaneously
through the combustion of a specific fuel. On the other hand, PAFCs have much
the same disadvantages as PEMs, which essentially boil down to the fuel cell’s high
cost due to using a platinum catalyst [20, 21]. However, compared with AFCs,
hydrogen vapor impurities do not influence PAFCs. These fuel cells have an effi-
ciency of about 40%–50%, whereas the efficiency of cogeneration can be as high
as 85% [22]. Figure 9.2 shows the schematic of the PAFC battery with its main
components.
9.2.1.3
Alkaline Fuel Cell
Alkaline fuel cells have been exploited in the field of space missions by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as the first type of fuel
cell used in this sector [23]. They are characterized by an electrolyte, an aqueous
solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) as shown in Figure 9.3. The AFC system is
characterized by ions being negatively charged toward the cathode, releasing
water. In contrast, at the cathode, electrons returning from the anode react with
oxygen and water to form new hydroxyl ions [24]. Therefore, fuel cells are reduced

to pure hydrogen and oxygen elements to avoid CO2 absorption, which impedes
the conductivity of the electrolyte.
The temperature of these types of batteries is between 60 C and 120 C with an
electrical efficiency that reaches 70% [25]. To keep the AFCs working correctly and
to avoid cell destruction, it is recommended not to exceed the operating temper-
ature of 70 C [26]. These types of FCs are designed to be used for low-power
onboard applications in the range (of 1–100 kW). The choice of this type of fuel
cell comes down to its several advantages, including good efficiency of 60%–
70%, fast start-up, no greenhouse gas emissions, and high-power density. However,
the problem of carbon dioxide sensitivity limits the use of AFCs despite all these
advantages.
9.2.1.4
Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell
Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) are fuel cells known for their ability to operate
under high temperatures that can reach the range of 600 C–650 C and are char-
acterized by an electrolyte in the form of a molten alkali carbonate [27]. Figure 9.4

efficiency ranging from 50% to 60%) with a low-power density compared to other
fuel cells ranging from 100 to 150 mW/cm2. It works because hydrogen combines
with carbonate ions (CO2
2−) in a redox reaction, whereby electrons are released to
produce water and carbon dioxide. In a reduction reaction at the cathode, oxygen
combines with carbon dioxide and incoming electrons to release carbonate ions
[28]. Despite the disadvantages of MCFC, including low-power density, system
complexity, and sulfur sensitivity, on the other hand, it has many advantages,
including high efficiency, high internal reforming capacity, and the absence of
metal catalyst in its structure. As a result, the use of MCFCs remains limited in
large installations, making them more available in power plants and industrial
cogeneration. According to MCFC studies, the significant challenge for improving
the commercialization of conventional hydrogen-fueled and direct internal
reforming MCFCs is the stability of the electrodes [29].
9.2.1.5
Solid Oxide Fuel Cell
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are characterized by their high operating tempera-
tures of up to 1000 C with a high efficiency of 65%. The electrolyte used in this type
of fuel cell is yttrium-stabilized zirconium, which is considered to be a ceramic-
based solid material. Two types of SOFCs are defined according to the mobile
ion the proton-conducting SOFCs and oxygen ion-conducting SOFCs [30]. The
SOFC is considered one of the most promising fuel cells despite the obstacles that
prevent its commercialization, including mainly its high operating temperature
[31], which is why recent research focuses on reducing this temperature. To solve
this problem, the principal solution proposed is the improvement of anode SOFCs
by manufacturing cells with a very thin electrolyte to reduce the temperature to
about 700 C–800 C [32].
On the other hand, the SOFC-gas turbine hybrid system can be considered an
efficient method for industrial power supplies and in the automotive sector due
to the high competence that this system offers. Moreover, SOFCs have several

advantages, such as high efficiency, internal reforming (IR) capability, and possi-
bility to use non-conventional fuels such as biomass. Figure 9.5 shows the detailed
system diagram of the solid-oxide fuel cell.
9.2.1.6
Direct Methanol Fuel Cell
The DMFC is an FC that uses methanol as fuel. Its architecture is similar to the
PEM system, with the difference of using methanol instead of hydrogen. The
DMFC system does not need a fuel processor, making its structure more super-
ficial and efficient. Its operating principle generally consists of a membrane-
electrode combination squeezed between two bipolar plates to pass the fuel
through distribution channels [33]. Figure 9.6 shows the general concept of this
fuel cell type. There are three types of DMFC depending on the choice of fuel and
oxidant supply mode: direct passive methanol fuel cell, direct active methanol
fuel cell, and direct semi-passive fuel cell. The DMFC is characterized by its
low-operating temperature of up to 60 C with a power density of less than
100 mW/cm2. Its field of use includes mainly small electric vehicles and portable
applications.

Battery Technologies for Electric Vehicles
The battery is defined as a device that ensures energy storage to deliver electrical
energy. The battery has an operating system that serves to convert chemical energy
directly into electrical energy through several chemical reactions [34]. It is divided
into two categories: primary batteries and secondary batteries. Primary batteries
are characterized by the provision of energy for a single time during discharge,
while secondary batteries permanently offer storage energy during the process
of charge and discharge during the whole life of the battery.
The characteristics of a battery are generally defined by several criteria indicat-
ing its performance which are:
• Energy density
• Cost in the market
• The number of charging cycles
• The discharge processes
• The influence on the environment
• The temperature ranges
• The memory effects
This section will focus on secondary batteries as they are used in electric or
hybrid vehicles. Many batteries are used in EVs, generally based on lead acid,
nickel, lithium metal, silver, and sodium-sulfur. The following battery technolo-
gies that are used in EVs will be described respectively: lead-acid (Pb-acid),
nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-metal-hydride (Ni-MH), and lithium-ion (Li-
ion). Table 9.2 shows the characteristics of the different battery hybrid cars, their
electrification systems, costs, and reduction of CO2 emissions in each case.
9.3.1
Lead-Acid Batteries
Lead-acid batteries represent the oldest category of rechargeable batteries, which
appeared in 1859; therefore, its use was widespread in gasoline-powered vehicles,
but over time it has become widely used in electric cars [36]. This battery was first
used in 1981, introduced in a three-wheeled electric vehicle with a maximum
speed of 12 km/h. Therefore, in 1899, another use of this battery in the automotive
sector was implemented by powering an electric car designed by Camille Jenatzy
with a maximum speed of 100 km/h [37]. Although this type of battery is consid-
ered the most widespread battery technology in the automotive sector, its use is
mainly based on powering a vehicle’s starter motor. Many car manufacturers have
adopted lead-acid batteries, including the GM EV1 manufactured by General
Motors and the Toyota RAV4 EV. Lead-acid batteries are available in the market
in all sizes and with different voltage ratings and are characterized by their ability
9.3 Battery Technologies for Electric Vehicles

to provide high surge currents as needed due to their low internal impedance [38].
The efficiency of these batteries is because they offer high surge currents and a low
cost that reaches about (150 US$/kWh) despite the low ratio between energy/
weight and between energy/volume. In addition, there are several advantages
of the lead battery that have contributed to its use in electric vehicles, including
the fact that they have a high cell voltage (2 V), a h specified f, and ic power that
varies between 200 and 300 W/kg) [39]. However, they have several disadvantages,
including low specific energy which varies between 30 and 45 Wh/kg) and a short
life span between 400 and 600 cycles. Despite the success of lead-acid batteries dur-
ing the last century, their use has begun to decline because of lead, which is harm-
ful to the environment and makes it necessary to rely on other batteries.
This is explained by the fact that human health is affected when living near
lead battery plants, as it was found in a survey in China that the blood of residents
in Guangdong province reached up to 100 μg/L due to the waste emitted from a
lead-acid battery plant [40]. There are several types of lead-acid batteries, the main
ones being: SLI batteries, deep-cycle batteries, stationary batteries, and VRLA

batteries [41]. Indeed, SLI batteries are commonly used in the automotive sector,
they ensure in turn, the power supply of the starter to make the engine run.
Therefore, a generator will charge these batteries during the engine’s operation.
9.3.2
Nickel-Cadmium Battery (NiCd)
Waldemar Jungner invented the nickel-cadmium (NiCd) battery in 1899, which is
considered to be the first battery to use an alkaline electrolyte in its system. It is a
rechargeable battery with nickel and cadmium electrodes carefully placed in a
potassium hydroxide solution [42]. Indeed,this battery is equipped with a second-
ary cell with a margin of between 1.2 and 1.4 V with a density of energy double that
of the batteries with lead. It also has a long service life of up to 1000 charges. Dur-
ing the system operation of the battery in normal conditions, the ampere-hour
yield reaches 80%, while the watt-hour yield reaches 65%. It has the advantage over
lead-acid batteries in terms of robustness and energy density, but its high price has
been one of the obstacles to its diffusion. NiCd batteries also suffer from the “mem-
ory effect” in case they are exposed to continuous cycles of charge and discharge at
the same level, which can suffer a sudden drop in voltage as if it had been dis-
charged [43]. Cadmium is considered a toxic metal for the body and the environ-
ment, which requires special care in its use and recycling process. Cadmium can be
produced from other elements such as copper, lead, and zinc. Therefore, Ni-Cd
batteries are currently rarely used because of the toxicity of cadmium and are
rather replaced by other less polluting batteries, such as nickel-metal hydride
(NiMH) batteries.
9.3.3
Nickel-Metal-Hydride (Ni-MH)
The Ni-MH battery was invented in 1980 by Stanford R. Ovshinsky; it is charac-
terized by an alloy electrode that replaces the cadmium electrode and which
ensures in its turn the storage of hydrogen [44]. The Ni-MH battery is composed
of a positive Ni(OH)2 electrode, a negative metal hydride (MH) electrode, and a
potassium hydroxide solution as electrolyte (KOH). In recent years, this type of
battery has been used in hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic.
Unlike cadmium metal, NiMH batteries are environmentally friendly. The Toyota
Mirai hydrogen car is also equipped with a Ni-MH battery pack that weighs 29 kg
and offers the accumulation of 1.6 kWh of energy with an output voltage that
reaches 245 V [45]. The operating system of these batteries in electric vehicles
ensures the recovery of energy during deceleration and braking phases to restore
it when the vehicle moves at a low speed. Ni-MH has a very high-energy density
compared to lead, and nickel‑cadmium batteries, its chemical structure and
simple mechanism offer high-power capacity and long life. In addition, Ni-MH
9.3 Battery Technologies for Electric Vehicles

is considered a robust technology that ensures high tolerance during the over-
charge and over-discharge process.
9.3.4
Lithium-ion (Li-ion)
This technology was first commercialized in 1991 [46], and it is currently consid-
ered among the most dominant rechargeable batteries due to its simple architec-
ture, high charge capacity, and long life under normal conditions. Li-ion is
generally made up of a lithium element introduced as a cathode and graphite
used as the anode. The electrolyte ensures the ionic transfer of lithium between
the cathode and the anode by forming an ion channel. Li-ion batteries have high
efficiency and high-energy density (due to the high electrochemical potential of
lithium) ranging from 90 to 190 Wh/kg and low maintenance, which make them
commonly used in portable applications and electric vehicles [47]. Li-ion bat-
teries have been adopted by several car manufacturers such as General Motors
in the Chevy-Volt model, Tesla has also used Li-ion in their Roadster model, and
Mitsubishi in their iMiEV model. Despite the advantages of the Li-ion battery, it
has some disadvantages, mainly its high cost, which varied between $900/kWh
and $1300/kWh in 2012. However, this disadvantage is no longer seriously con-
sidered because the cost of Li-ion has clearly decreased to a range between 200
and 700 US$/kWh [48]. On the other hand, it also has a low safety margin
because it has low resistance against temperatures exceeding 70 C–100 C. This
phenomenon of thermal risk leads to thermal runaways, which can cause an
explosion or an accident in electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries are found
in the market under several categories that are mainly distinguished by the cath-
ode, as it is the main source of all active lithium ions in a lithium-ion battery
system. Below are the different types of lithium-ion batteries most commonly
used in EVs.
9.3.4.1
Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO2, LCO)
This type of material was used in the construction of the first Li-Ion commer-
cialized by the Sony group in 1991 [49]. The LCO is considered the most used
material thanks to its characteristics with specific energy between 150 and 190
Wh/kg and a nominal voltage equal to 3.6 V [50]. Its system consists essentially
of a cathode made of cobalt oxide and an anode made of carbon graphite. Dur-
ing the discharge process, Li-ion ions move from the anode to the cathode, and
the process is reversed during the charge. This type of battery has an average
operating temperature, a limited specific power, and a service life that varies
between 800 and 1000 depending on the charge, discharge, and temperature
conditions.

9.3.4.2
Lithium Manganese Oxide (LiMn2O4, LMO/Spinel)
LiMn2O4 are cathode materials that offer fast charging and high current discharge
due to the low internal resistance of the cells. This battery is characterized by a
three-dimensional (3D) spinel architecture that ensures a more efficient ion flow
at the electrode [51]. As a result, LiMn2O4 has several advantages, including its
high-voltage rating of over 3 V, and high-energy density of 300 Wh/kg [52].
9.3.4.3
Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP)
The lithium iron phosphate battery has the advantage of reliability due to the use
of phosphate material as a cathode material, high safety, and low cost. The intro-
duction of phosphate in the cathode system of this battery has guaranteed a strong
resistance against high temperatures, and its olivine structure also ensures excel-
lent stability in the overcharge process. LFPs offer an average voltage of 3.40 V, a
specific capacity reaching 160 mAh/g [53], and a considered high life cycle that
varies between 1000 and 2000. In addition, it has a specific energy that varies
between 90 and 120 Wh/kg and an operating temperature of up to 300 C [54].
LFPs have been adopted by several automotive companies such as Tesla, BYD,
and General Motors.
9.4
Overview of Brushless Motor
Permanent magnet synchronous motors can be classified into two main groups,
the AC permanent magnet synchronous motor (PI) is characterized by a sinusoi-
dal-shaped back EMF. The second is the brushless DC motor (BLDC) which has a
trapezoidal-shaped back EMF [55]. Brushless motors are considered a new tech-
nology for conventional DC motors with an electronic commutation principle.
This type of motor eliminates the need for a commutator and brushes, its system
contains a rotating permanent magnet on the rotor and stationary magnets on the
motor housing. The BLDC motor is widely used in industrial sectors such as aer-
ospace and medical equipment, but also in the automotive sector such as Honda,
Peugeot, and Toyota in its hybrid model named Toyota Prius. This motor offers a
high power-to-weight ratio and efficiency compared to other machines, easy main-
tenance, and long life under normal conditions. However, this lifetime may be lim-
ited in the case of operation at high intensities. In addition, the problem of high
cost frequently arises because the BLDC system requires control electronics,
increasing the total approved cost [56]. On the other hand, BLDC motors can
be used for energy storage and conversion. BLDC motors can contribute to the
energy storage process. For example, if the BLDC motor functions as a generator
during periods of excess energy, it can store the excess energy in a battery.

Before accessing the control of a brushless motor, it is first necessary to specify
the modeling followed to ensure the mathematical set of corresponding equations.
The following part deals with the global modeling of a brushless motor.
9.4.1
Mathematical Modeling of BLDC Motor
Modeling a BLDC motor requires the representation of all electrical and mechan-
ical equations.
9.4.1.1

The expression of the corresponding electrical speed is written as follows:

The set of electromotive forces of the three phases (a, b, c) can be expressed using
the relationship between the speed of rotation and the EMF:
ea = kewrf a θ
eb = kewrf b θ
ec = kewrf c θ
9 4
The expression of the electromotive force depends on the rotor position and is
characterized by an offset of 120 .

BLDC Motor Control Strategy for Electric Vehicles
Brushless motors are considered an alternative technology to conventional DC
motors. For the control of BLDC in the case of electric vehicles, many control
methods are applied, whether with the adoption of sensors or without sensors.
There is a classical control for using proportional-integral (PI) controllers or pro-
portional-integral derivative (PID) controllers. Other developed techniques are
also implemented including fuzzy logic control, digital signal processor (DSP),
adaptive neuro-fuzzy controller, etc. The following section discusses sensorless
control methods [57].
9.5.1
PI Controller
This proportional-integral (PI) controller is used in various applications in the
industrial sector. It ensures the delivery of control of a system using the difference
between the set point and the output obtained. It is characterized by its simple
architecture and its contribution to the realization of several control strategies,
such as predictive control.

PID Controller
PID control is a name that symbolizes the three terms: P represents the propor-
tional term, the letter I represents the integral term, and D represents the deriva-
tive term of the controller. The PID controller has proven its competence in the
industrial field because it ensures the improvement of the stability, precision,
and speed of the system it is applied to control the speed of a brushless motor,
and the PID controller is a popular choice to ensure better results. PID controller
can exist in three structures according to the combination of the three actions, they
are series PID controller, parallel PID controller, and ideal PID controller. The
architecture of the PID controller is shown in Figures 9.7–9.9.
The following transfer function describes the case of the parallel PID:

S + KdS

proposed to fix in a fast way the different parameters of the controller. These are
the Ziegler-Nichols method, the critical point method, and the index response
method.
9.5.3
Fuzzy Logic Controller
Fuzzy logic control technology has proven its high capacity very quickly, becoming
one of the most used control techniques in industrial applications. LF consists of
expressing operational rules in linguistic forms instead of mathematical equations.
The integration of LF has contributed to the simplicity of complex systems to be
controlled. Comparative studies have shown the success of LF control compared to
those providing conventional control algorithms. This has ensured the presence of
this control mode in various electric motor control systems, including the brush-
less motor.
9.5.3.1
Fuzzification
This phase consists of transforming real quantities into fuzzy quantities, each input
value is represented in linguistic form by the intermediary of membership functions,
by allotting to each input its own membership function for a moment t. In fuzzy
logic, the linguistic terms are generally represented in logical elements such as
the expression of the rules (If.then).
9.5.3.2
Fuzzy Inference
Fuzzy inference is an operation that ensures the formulation of the mapping of a
determined input to an output by the principle of fuzzy logic. The fuzzy inference
technique has presented great success in several fields, such as regulating auto-
mated systems and electronic applications.
9.5.3.3
Defuzzification
This step consists of converting the internal fuzzy output variables into real vari-
ables so the system can use these variables. This operation can be done by different
methods, the most famous of which are: the max criterion method, the height
method, the centroid method, or the center of area method.
For the speed control of a brushless motor, it is necessary to specify the
applied fuzzy inference rules. Table 9.4 represents the set of fuzzy inference rules
adopted in this case, whose corresponding fuzzy membership functions are the
following.

9.6
Simulation Results
The simulation results are obtained from the realization of three different
control systems of a brushless motor: PI, PID, and fuzzy logic control, as in
Figures 9.10–9.12. Indeed, these figures illustrate the rotor speed of a BLDC
motor and the currents when different controllers are used. The motor achieves
a speed of 2000 rpm in 0.5 seconds with turbulence (resistive torque Cr) in time
0.3 seconds, then we change the speed to 1000 rpm in all circumstances,
although with varying rise time, settling time, and stability. We note that the
speed curve in PID and PI contains many oscillations contrary to the curve
of fuzzy logic. However, the current curve in the three control cases is consid-
ered close with slight differences. For example, by observing the current curves
in Figures 9.10 and 9.11, we can see that the PID has succeeded in reducing the
disturbance that appeared in the case of the PI controller between the instants 0
and 0.1 seconds.
The results obtained from the simulation in Matlab proved that the fuzzy logic
was the best among the three implemented controllers, as shown in the speed
curve where the disturbances were reduced powerfully. Therefore, the PID con-
troller showed its effectiveness before the PI controller as shown in the speed
and current curves presented above. The PID controller has a shorter rise time
than the PI and fuzzy controllers. The PI and PID controllers have the same
and shorter settling times as the fuzzy controller. The PI overshoot percentage
is 1.5% higher than the fuzzy controller, and the PID overshoot percentage is
0.7% higher than the fuzzy controller.
Table 9.5 compares various operating characteristics such as rising time, settling
time, and overshoot percentage.

Environnemental Impact of EVs
Although it is generally accepted that electric cars do not harm the environment,
they can indirectly contribute to pollution. Indeed, producing electricity in these
vehicles is accompanied by greenhouse gas emissions. The effect of greenhouse gas
emissions caused by any type of EV always depends on the primary materials or
other sources producing the electricity. For example, coal-fired EVs severely dam-
age the environment with a global warming potential up to 27% higher than diesel
and gasoline vehicles [58]. While HEVs and PHEVs have lower emissions than
ICE vehicles [59]. In general, EVs are considered the best means of transportation
to save the planet from climate pollution. Electric vehicles recharged from renew-
able energy sources are a non-polluting technology that deserves to be more widely
available in the automotive market.

EVs and Modern Technologies
Electric cars are known for their environmental friendliness, especially concerning
air pollution, reducing damage to human health compared to the harmful emis-
sions produced by conventional vehicles [60]. In addition, several innovative arti-
ficial intelligence technologies have been recently used to improve and optimize
storage systems in electric vehicles as in Ref. [61] whose authors have used the
fuzzy logic controller to ensure better battery management. Several modern stra-
tegies have been applied to maintain the safety of vehicles while driving. In Ref.
[62], an Internet of things (IoT)-based system is used to organize vehicles’ move-
ment and specify their parking. A new branch of IOT called the Internet of vehicles

Challenges and Perspectives of EVs
Among the most worrying challenges in the construction of EVs is autonomy
because using batteries reduces the profitability of these vehicles regarding driv-
ing time because of the need for this type of car to recharge every period. For
example, a battery-powered vehicle is able to travel a distance of up to 250 km
[63]. This capacity is considered an evolution in EVs, but it is insufficient to
replace conventional vehicles. Moreover, with the development of electric vehi-
cle technologies, the dream of replacing traditional vehicles with electric ones
has become a reality. Therefore, a study presented in the United States [64] esti-
mates that when conventional vehicles are replaced by battery-powered vehicles,
greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by about 25%. The same study also
cited that when fuel-cell electric vehicles are used instead of conventional vehi-
cles, emissions will be reduced by 40%.

Conclusion
This work has examined the main terms in electric vehicles: energy storage sys-
tems and electric motor control strategies for adopting the brushless motor. The
study carried out in this work allows researchers to know the best energy stor-
age technologies for EVs with the advantages and disadvantages of each
method. On the other hand, within the framework of BLDC engine control,
the results obtained during simulation present the effect of each of the three
controllers used. First, a detailed study of the different types of fuel cells has
been presented. In the second part, the different battery technologies used in
EVs were discussed, and several brushless motor control strategies were pro-
posed to make a comparison between PI, PID, and fuzzy logic control when
simulating these systems with Matlab software. The simulation results clearly
showed the efficiency of the fuzzy logic control compared to the other proposed
control models.

creating pollution-free transportation in the transportation sector. Compared to
conventional transport, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle reduces greenhouse gas
emissions by approximately 45% and provides a better alternative to gasoline-
and diesel-operated vehicles [1, 2]. China’s EV market is growing splendidly,
followed by Germany, United States, and India. The worldwide EV policy has cre-
ated awareness among the people for green transportation. Many researchers are
paying attention to enhancing the technology of electric motors and batteries in
terms of lightweight, increasing the charging capability and efficiency of the device
[1, 2]. With the increased use of EVs in developed and developing countries, EV
charging station facilities must be developed to provide cheaper charging facilities
for all vehicles with more negligible environmental effects. Based on the data of
Global EV Outlook in 2019, the global electric car navy reached 5.12 million in
2018, an increase of 2.1 million compared to 2017, almost doubling EV revenue
in just one year. However, in 2018, only 2.2% of the world’s passenger cars were
electric cars, which means there is still a long way to go before electrification
becomes a reality. Figure 10.1 shows the top countries’ battery EV market by
volume till 2019 [2].

10.1 Introduction
267

According to the figure, China is the leading country in electric vehicles, fol-
lowed by the United States, Norway, and Germany. In the recent scenario, India
has played a crucial role in the field of electric vehicles, and over the last two to
three years, the number of registered electric vehicles has increased splendidly in
India. This chapter comprehensively reviews EVs, including design and control
systems, battery thermal management and design, reliability analysis, and world-
wide policies.
The motivation to write on this topic is that EVs are widely regarded as a path
towards sustainable transportation. They run on electricity stored in batteries,
which can be charged from the electric grid, and produce zero tailpipe emissions.
This makes them an attractive alternative to traditional gasoline- or diesel-
powered vehicles, which contribute significantly to air pollution and climate
change.
However, there are also some research gaps or challenges to the widespread
adoption of electric vehicles. One of the biggest challenges is the high cost of bat-
teries, which makes EVs more expensive than traditional vehicles. Range anxiety
is another issue, as many consumers are concerned about the limited range of EVs
and the availability of charging infrastructure. Interconnected modern multi-
energy networks refer to the integration of various energy sources and infrastruc-
tures to meet the energy demands of different sectors, including transportation. In
the context of EVs, this concept involves the integration of renewable energy
sources, such as solar and wind power, with the electricity grid to support the char-
ging infrastructure for electric vehicles.
To enable the widespread adoption of EVs, it is crucial to establish an efficient
and reliable charging infrastructure that can accommodate the increased electric-
ity demand. Interconnected modern multi-energy networks can help optimize the
charging process by leveraging renewable energy sources, energy storage systems,
and smart grid technologies. These networks can balance the supply and demand
of electricity, manage peak loads, and ensure the integration of EV charging with
the overall energy system.
Furthermore, interconnected multi-energy networks can facilitate the develop-
ment of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. This technology allows electric vehicles
not only to consume electricity from the grid but also feed excess energy back into
the grid when needed. This bidirectional energy flow can enhance the grid’s flex-
ibility, support renewable energy integration, and contribute to a more resilient
and sustainable energy system.
To address these challenges, governments and private companies are investing
in the development of more affordable and efficient batteries, as well as in the
expansion of charging infrastructure. Many countries are also offering incentives,
such as tax credits and rebates, to encourage consumers to purchase electric
vehicles.

10 Electric Vehicle Path Towards Sustainable Transportation

The following are the objectives and novelty of this chapter:
1) Assessment of the optimum and design prospectus of the EVs.
2) Analyze the thermal management of the battery system.
3) Reliability assessment of the EV system.
4) Assessment of the EV charging station.
10.2
Optimum Design of EVs
Analyzing the different technical parameters and their relationship to other
parameters is the first step in database design to create a conceptual model of
various components connected. The electric motor provides propulsion to the
wheel as per torque-speed characteristics. As it provides high starting torque,
it is necessary to identify appropriate motor with proper specification. EVs’ per-
formance and reliability depend on the battery bank’s battery system capacity
and charging capability. The converter is a key component of EVs, which con-
verts AC to DC, DC to AC, and stepping up/down the DC voltage through buck
and boost converters [1–3]. Figure 10.2 shows the framework of the different
components of EVs.

10.2 Optimum Design of EVs
269

The foundation of ammonia-based plug-in EVs was defined by Chu and
Wu [4]. To overcome some of the limitations of conventional EVs, a hydrogen
fuel cell hybrid vehicle is proposed, in which ammonia serves as a source of
hydrogen, resulting in greater vehicle range capacity. The basic components
of this dynamic model were an electric motor, battery, capacitor, and fuel cell.
Zhang and Liu [5] suggested an assessment of hybrid green cars using a unique
driving system. The outcome indicates a roughly 16.32% reduction in fuel
usage when compared to a traditional EV drive system. This study also dis-
cusses the vehicle framework evaluation procedure, static and dynamic
conditions, and various drive system modes. Tanozzi and Sharma [6] devel-
oped a method for determining the thermal characteristics of hybrid electric
vehicles.
This paper’s three main points of conversation are the layout of heat
exchanger networks, optimum heat exchanger sizing, and thermal parameter
optimization. Chatterjee and Iyer [7] analyzed the optimum design of a wireless
energy transfer system for EVs, which is assessed by calculating passive ele-
ments, quality factor, and resonance condition or bandwidth of the coil used
in the EVs. Borthakur and Subramanian [8] presented the optimum design
and assessment of series-parallel integrated green vehicles and power train
mechanisms for heavy four-wheeler EVs. Figure 10.3 shows the block diagram
of the series-parallel integrated mechanism. Figure 10.4 shows the key para-
meters of the design of EVs.
Czogalla and Jumar [9] described the design assessment of electric bus vehi-
cles to determine long-range energy consumption. The author discussed and
worked on the optimum route for EV buses to reduce energy consumption
and increase system efficiency. The main technical parameters are the static
and dynamic traffic conditions, terrain grades, and charging and discharging
capacity of the electric bus. Hofman and Janssen [10] described the optimum
hybrid design of the transmission system of EVs. The key ingredients of
this paper are the splendid transition between the power train, optimum
energy utilization and reduction of loss of an electric motor, and overall speed
ratio. Vora and Jin [11] explained EV modeling for medium-duty truck
applications for large highway distances. Several EV limitations, such as eco-
nomic viability, risk reluctance, and lower efficiency on the highway, are miti-
gated in this paper, along with a technical-financial assessment of heavy-duty
trucks.

10.2 Optimum Design of EVs
271

Valle and Viera [12] assessed EVs’ design and validation and found EVs’ energy
consumption and performance assessment with real-time static and dynamic data.
A software tool is developed to analyze and forecast the power consumption of
green vehicles. Delogu and Zanchi [13] investigated composites and materials
to further the development of lightweight EVs; it also gave cradle grave assessment
of EVs from an environmental point of view, and the result shows that some hur-
dles persist. Hang and Han [14] proposed a model of a collision-avoidance system
for stand-alone four-wheel steering and drive EVs. Zhou and Qin [15] presented an
EV power train’s multi-optimum design and technical parameter assessment.
Parameters such as fuel cost, vehicle energy consumption, vehicle velocity and
acceleration, and power train performance assessment are the key point of this
paper. The result shows that EVs must be developed with higher efficiency and
low fuel cost to perform well.
During the optimum design of the electric vehicle, another essential factor is
tractive force, which is given by

Xin and Chengning [16] assessed the perfect range capacity and life cycle and
battery of an EV by developing a model using the principle of minimum curb mass.
Table 10.1 summarizes the technical aspects of EVs.
Roozegar et al. [24] described the modeling parameters of a novel modular mul-
tispeed transmission system for EVs. K-filter, neural network, and Leuenberger
observer were used to assess EVs’ technical parameters. Giorgio and Trolio [25]
described IC engines and fuel cell hybrid-based vehicle modeling. The technical
parameters of the hybrid EVs are the rolling inertia, frontal area, drag coefficient,
rolling resistance coefficient, battery pack energy density, and fuel cell and IC
engine power weight. Guo and Sun [26] explained the design and optimization
of energy management of the EV by assessing the technical parameter of hybrid
EV using the optimal Latin hypercube algorithm, and error is mitigated by Pon-
tryagin’s minimum principle-based controller, which is also used for energy man-
agement of hybrid EVs. Li et al. [27] described proton exchange membrane fuel
cell-based EVs used for range extension of hybrid vehicles. The paper discussed
the interrelationship between the membrane and nanostructured system-based
EV characterization. Dimitrova and Maréchal [28] presented the techno-economic
design of a hybrid EV using a multi-objective algorithm. A genetic algorithm
assesses the technical parameters and estimates power-train equipment cost.
Outcomes: Extensive work has already been reported on EVs; still, there is
a need to design an EV that provides 0% greenhouse gas emissions and creates
a pollution-free environment. Finding a proper battery system replacement is also
necessary due to their invariable charging and discharging nature. Research shows
272

that fuel cells, electrolyzers, and ultra-capacitors will provide better alternatives to
battery systems shortly. Electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted the attention of the
automobile industry and researchers to attain zero emissions and low energy
usage. The primary requirements for consumers in the EV industry are mileage,
speed, performance, efficiency, high storage battery for increased mileage and pro-
tection, and, most crucially, EV cost. It is necessary to identify the optimum design
of curb weight, gross weight, wheel power and energy, wheel force, and aerody-
namic force for the ideal electric vehicle performance. The Internet of things, arti-
ficial intelligence, and machine learning may be used to design EVs with higher
efficiency, less pollution, and better driving comfort.

reaction happening inside is reversed, bringing the battery to a charged condition
[29, 30]. Following are the different characterizations of the electric vehicle battery
system.
10.3.1
Thermal Management of Battery
Lithium-air batteries are a relatively new development in the lithium-ion battery
area. The lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery (or lithium-air battery) obtains its energy
from the interaction of oxygen in the air with lithium, which comprises Li-metal
and a porous conductive framework as electrodes. Although the technology is still
in its early stages, it has the potential to deliver substantially greater energy storage
and better thermal control than a normal lithium-ion battery. Many academics
have already worked on battery system heat management. Wiriyasart and Hom-
malee [31] provided a computational analysis method representing temperature
distribution. The EV battery modules include 444 cylindrical lithium-ion cell bat-
teries. Lyu and Siddique [32] discussed the thermal maintenance of EV batteries
using the thermal cooling method.
Furthermore, when 40 V is provided to the heater, the battery surface temper-
ature drops from 54 C to 11 C utilizing a cooling water system for a single cell with
a copper holder. Thermal control of Li-ion EVs using air cooling and a heat pipe
was detailed by Behi and Karimi [33]. Furthermore, the temperature consistency
of the battery module has improved by 38.2%, 67.5%, and 74.4%, respectively, for
restricted air cooling, heat funnels, and HPCS. Akinlabi and Solyali [34] described
a complete review of the configuration, modeling, and assessment of thermal man-
agement of the EV battery system. This research examines and compares passive
and active air-cooled battery thermal management system (BTMS) methodologies
and design parameter optimization strategies (through iteration or algorithms) for
achieving various BTMS design goals. In the thermal management system, the bat-
tery cooling system is a significant factor and is classified as shown in Figure 10.5.
Chung and Kim [35] used a liquid cooling approach to develop a thermal model
for EV batteries. The inadequate warmth transmission from the foot of the cell
stack to the cooling plate is one of the major impediments to productive warmth
dispersion and deviating plan of the balance cell game plan and has a negative
influence on the battery pack’s temperature consistency to numerical results. Shen
and Gao [36] demonstrated a refrigerant-based EV battery bank heat management
system. The difference in temperature between cells and the mean temperature of
the battery module is effectively managed, resulting in increased system efficiency.
A cabin priority control strategy and a series-connected system configuration are
used to develop the thermal management system. Heat pipe-based thermal man-
agement methods for EV battery systems were described by Smith and Singh [37].
The heat pipe framework comprises two parts: heat pipe cooling plates for
274
10 Electric Vehicle Path Towards Sustainable Transportation

extracting heat from the battery module’s electrochemical cells and remote heat
transfer funnel to transport heat from the module to fluid-cooled cold plates
300 mm away. Compared to a traditional fluid-cooled system, a two-stage heat
pipe-based warm control provides superior cell/module temperature constancy,
a cleaner construction, and a more stable framework (no spillage issues in high
voltage regions). A two-stage investigation of these warmth pipe segments and
a single-stage examination for the virus plate partition were carried out. Cen
and Li [38] assessed the EV battery system’s thermal management system’s air-
conditioning system. Experimental findings show that the EV battery thermal
management-based device can easily regulate the battery pack’s temperature at
an acceptable preset value at an intense ambient temperature of up to 41 C. Opti-
mizing the coolant circuit can minimize temperature nonuniformity inside the
battery pack. Kim and Oh [39] described a complete overhaul of the temperature
management system for EV systems with a battery bank. This work studied the
thermal dynamics and important thermal issues of Li-ion batteries. Various bat-
tery thermal management system experiments are carefully examined and classi-
fied according to selected temperature cycles. Cabin air cooling, second-circuit
liquid, and two-stage direct liquid cooling are part of the battery thermal manage-
ment system with a vapor compression cycle. Tian and Gan [40] described battery
cooling and waste heat recovery-based thermal management systems for EV-used
battery systems. The outcomes show that the level of cooling limit decrease was in
the range of 26.30–32.10%, and the level of waste thermal recuperation was in the
range of 18.73–45.17%.

Moreover, the EV thermal management system (EVTMS) model was created
and approved with exploratory information, which anticipated vitality utilization,
framework limit, and coefficient of performance (COP) in the range of
0.68–21.05%. Half-and-half reproduction strategies were completed to contem-
plate the impact of EVTMS on the vehicle’s driving extent. Ianniciello and Biwolé
[41] described a phase transition material-based temperature management system
for EV batteries. This article reviews prior advances and introduces PCMs for bat-
tery cooling in electric vehicles. Different systems are examined, and ways to
improve PCM efficiency in those networks are given. Table 10.2 shows the proper-
ties of lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries.
10.3.2
Assessment of Battery System
Numerous charging methods are the most ordinarily utilized strategy for corrosive
lead batteries. This technique charges the battery until the cell voltage reaches a
foreordained level. The current is then turned off, the cell voltage is allowed to
decline to another foreordained level, and the current is turned on again. Since
the late 1980s, battery-powered lithium cells have entered the market. Many
researchers are already working in the field of EV battery, and Hong and Wang
[42] described the assessment parameters of the EV battery system through a
short-term prediction model. In all, 8760 hours of charging station data were
retrieved at the provision and organization center for EVs in Beijing to assist the
short-term model and verify the model’s validity, maintainability, and reliability.
Further, a synchronous multiple fault prognosis is feasible based on reliable bat-
tery device parameter prediction. Wang [43] described the performance assess-
ment of the EV battery system. Yang and Zhu [44] detailed the execution,
design, and control system of the battery system of an electric vehicle. Nonlinear
robust fractional order control costs 78.00%, 85.21%, and 87.76% of proportional
integral derivative control, linear control, and sliding-mode control, respectively,

in profound load situations. Finally, a hardware-in-loop experiment utilizing the
DSpace platform is used to verify the viability of its implementation. Wegmann
and Döge [45] conducted a comparative analysis of solid-state lithium metal, high
polymer energy, and lithium-ion high-power batteries.

The device’s effectiveness is estimated under ordinary and outrageous driving
conditions based on the general vehicle reproduction model, including the ther-
mal model of the lithium metal polymer battery pack. The discoveries show that
the hybridization of the battery allows the lithium metal polymer battery to be uti-
lized appropriately in an EV. Saw and Poon [46] explained the mathematical mod-
eling of EV battery systems. The outcomes acquired reveal that the dynamic
pressure, top force request, and thermal execution of the battery have been essen-
tially improved by consolidating supercapacitors into the battery pack in HESS. In
correlation with the ordinary battery energy stockpiling framework, the peak cur-
rent requests of the battery in HESS for UDDS and US06 cycles have been
decreased by 62%, 71.9%, and 70.7%, individually. This methodology has been
demonstrated to be viable in expanding the battery’s life expectancy and can
improve the well-being and unwavering quality of the traditional battery energy
storage system in EVs. The electromechanical and chemical evaluation of lith-
ium-ion batteries, which are utilized in EVs, was presented by Niu and Garg
[47]. Five study concerns, including the plan criteria for the exposition assessment
of batteries, are attempted in this one-of-a-kind circumstance. The main concern is
battery performance under pressure situations, which was addressed by varying
the initial pressure, continued loads, and a range of battery pack limits. Wegmann
and Döge [48] described the optimum working of EV-used battery through deter-
ministic and stochastic dynamic programming. This research focuses on the opti-
mum feasible functioning of the mixed battery system utilized in EVs. Two
algorithms were investigated and tested concerning the provided system and con-
trol issue. First, the worldwide ideal control process is inferred using dynamic pro-
gramming and a causal controller, which ensures adequate continuing control of
the battery framework. Figure 10.6 shows different assessment parameters of the
battery system.
10.3 Characterization of EV Battery System

Outcomes: The above research work on the battery is classified into two cate-
gories: the battery’s thermal system and the battery bank’s properties. Research
shows that different cooling processes for the battery bank’s thermal system are
air cooling, water cooling, cold water cooling, and heat pipe cooling and men-
tioned that cooling of the battery is equally important for the proper functioning
of EV. Attention must be paid to charging and discharging capability, including
various properties of batteries, to increase the range of EVs.
10.4
Control System of EVs
The inconsequential functions of the control system are component monitoring
and protection, such as battery state of charge, battery temperature, electric motor
overheating, and internal combustion engine overheating. Lots of researchers are
working towards the proper control mechanism for EV systems. Wu and Xu [49]
presented a thermoelectric surge management system for fuel cell-powered auto-
mobiles, which lowers heat loss and generates saturated features in the vehicle sys-
tem. The notion of a neural network brake control system for EV operation was
presented by He and Wang [50]. This control method increases energy efficiency,
and an adaptive fuzzy controller regulates EV and single-pedal regenerative brak-
ing stability; multi-objective neural networks control the brake pedal further.

Tan and Shen [51] described applying a non-fragile H infinity control system in
the field of EVs. In this paper, Lyapunov theory is also used to find the desired
controller gains and feasible solutions to the matrix inequality of an EV. Shi
and Cheng [52] explained the concept of adaptive control systems to control the
steering mechanism of EVs under different road conditions. The overall system
is also simulated in the CORSIM-MATLAB environment, and the results show
that the adaptive control system plays a vital role in mitigating the power steering
problem in different road circumstances. Balaska and Ladaci [53] adopted an
adaptive cruise control system for an EV. An adaptive controller is used for regu-
lating the current in the inner loop and maintaining desired speed tracking for the
outer loop of EVs. Qiu and Wang [54] described a control system of regenerative
braking for green vehicles under different critical driving conditions. The paper
also proposed a serial control strategy for control systems for EVs. EV is tested
in four different road conditions and at four different drag coefficients. Yang
and Wang [55] used an observer-based control system on supercapacitor-operated
EVs. Based on the conventional fifth-order averaged model described, sliding
mode control for battery and supercapacitor-operated EVs in which a DC/DC con-
verter is used to isolate the battery and supercapacitor packs from the DC bus.
Finally, the hardware in the loop test is utilized to determine whether the sug-
gested control system is successful. Luo and Yu [56] analyzed the control system
of the AC motor of the EV drive-train by finite time dynamic surface control sys-
tem. This paper proposes a neural system-based limited-time dynamic surface
position-based control strategy for acceptance engines with input immersion in
EV drive frameworks. The neural systems are used to estimate the obscure non-
linear capacities immediately. Dynamic surface control is utilized in conventional
backstopping innovation to control the “blast of unpredictability.” He and Quan

[57] conducted an error analysis of fuel cell-operated EVs by a hydrogen circula-
tion system-based model predictive control system. This study creates a model pre-
scient control approach for the hydrogen course framework to manage the flowing
hydrogen stream. A model of the flexible hydrogen framework that contains a
stream control valve, a gracefully complex, an arrival complex, and a hydrogen
coursing siphon is right off the bat created to depict the conduct of the hydrogen
mass stream elements in the Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. Xu and
Chen [58] described the torque optimization control of an EV with a regenerative
braking system. When subject to the actuator limitations, this proposed torque
dissemination controller can boost the recovery effectiveness by determining
the pressure-driven deceleration torque and engine slowing down torque.
Absolute slowing down torque of the four wheels tracks the slowing down
prerequisite.
Moreover, to guarantee brake well-being, the slowing down torque of the front
and back wheels is advanced to improve the chance of vitality recuperation. Alam-
dari and Voos [59] described the concept of nonlinear predictive control in the field
of EVs. The paper’s main contribution is the structure of an ongoing nonlinear
model prescient controlled with improved disparity requirements taking care of
and monetary punishment capacity to design the online-savvy cruising speed.
An all-inclusive voyage control driver helps framework controls the longitudinal
velocity of the BEV in a safe and vitality proficient way by exploiting street slants,
powerful drive around bends, and adhering to the guidelines. Figure 10.8 shows

Zhang and Zhao [60] described decoupling control of the steering and driving
system of an EV system. A control procedure dependent on the nonlinear decou-
pling control technique is proposed in this paper to improve the mobility and
steadiness of in-wheel-engine drive EVs. The reverse framework decoupling
hypothesis is applied to disintegrate the vehicle’s nonlinear arrangement, making
it conceivable to understand the planned control of every subsystem.
Outcomes: The above literature survey shows that applying the perfect control
system on the EV is essential to reduce error and increase efficiency. It is also
essential to develop first stable control mechanisms for individual components
of the EV and then for the overall vehicle. Some researchers have already worked
on the thermo-electric surge control, braking stability, steering control system, tor-
que optimization of electric motor, and speed control mechanism of an electric
motor using several methods such as neural network, fuzzy controller, and model
predictive control system. In the near future, it is necessary to find the control
mechanism of the power flow of a generator or motor, the stable functioning of
a battery system, the converter system, and the proper control mechanism of
the steering system. Different optimization techniques may also be applied, such
as the cuckoo algorithm, chaotic particle swarm optimization technique, teacher
learning-based algorithm to develop good dynamic characteristics, and state-space
model of the control system of EVs.
10.5
Reliability Assessment of EV
One of the essential characteristics for evaluating any equipment is reliability,
which determines the gadget’s defect rate. In the case of EVs, the maintainability
and validity of various mathematical functions play a critical role in evaluating EV
performance [61, 62]. The dependability assessment of EV hosting capacity was
provided by Kamruzzaman and Benidris [63]. This study aims to maximize the
permissible penetration of electric vehicles on electric power network buses using
a reliability-restricted demand response-based strategy. If no remedies are
adopted, the further growth in electric vehicles will impact power system effi-
ciency. Implementing demand response systems can be an excellent way to min-
imize or even eliminate this burden. Anand and Bagen [64] provided a
probabilistic evaluation of the EV distribution system’s dependability. In this arti-
cle, the trustworthiness of several technical characteristics of an electric vehicle is
analyzed using a Markov chain method, and the modeling of travel patterns and
recharging capability is assessed using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach. Gan-
doman and Ahmadi [65] presented a reliability assessment of the electric motor,
battery, traction system, and electronics converter system. The problems and
10.5 Reliability Assessment of EV
281

potential prospects of EVs relating to reliability and health, which need to be
addressed, have also been studied. Gandoman and Jaguemont [66] explained
the safety and reliability assessment of lithium-ion batteries used in EVs. Main-
tainability and validity assessment of all the technical parameters of battery related
to further charging and discharging capability of lithium-ion systems is also
assessed.
Additionally, the input of Li-ion battery squalor in five main failure modes and
ability and power fade for providing validity evaluation models as solutions to
existing challenges have been investigated. Shu and Yang [67] described that
the reliability of the entire battery system is much lower than that of any other
individual parts, like battery modules. Davidov and Pantoš [68] analyzed the char-
ging station’s reliability analysis and presented an improvement model for char-
ging station arrangement to limit the general expense by fulfilling the charging
dependability and nature of administration expected by EV proprietors/drivers.
Outcomes: The analysis of reliability of EVs is necessary to assess the validity,
availability, maintainability, and fault rates of electric motors, batteries, conver-
ters, and EV charging stations. A sampling technique for location assessment
for charging stations and fault tree analysis determine EVs’ reliability in different
circumstances.
10.6
Assessment of EV Charging Station
Electric recharging points, charging points, electronic charging stations (ECS), and
EV supply equipment (EVSE) provide electric energy to recharge plug-in EVs such
as electric vehicles, neighborhood EVs, and plug-in hybrids, for use at home or
business. Some electric vehicles can connect onboard converters to a conventional
electrical socket or a high-capacity appliance outlet. Others require or make use of
a charging station with electrical conversion, monitoring, or safety features.
10.6.1
Location Assessment for EV Charging Station
Prefeasibility analysis is the first step to identifying suitable locations for installing
an EV charging station. Napoli and Polimeni [69] studied the best sites for green
vehicle charging stations along highways. The filtering algorithm does a prefeasi-
bility study of an EV and technological input parameters, and the outcome reveals
that charging station distribution is based on the capacity of EVs in those places.
Multi-criteria fuzzy logic-based optimum placement selection for EV charging sta-
tions was developed by Liu and Zhao [70]. Kong and Luo [71] described location
identification for charging stations according to the comfort level of operators,
consumers, traffic conditions, and power grid supply. Liu and Liu [72] described
282
10 Electric Vehicle Path Towards Sustainable Transportation

data-driven, intelligent system-based location identification of an EV charging sta-
tion. This will reduce the regular CO2 emissions generated by approximately
0.14–0.37 ha of forest per year and a reduction of 0.85–2.64% of the additional char-
ging criteria for forests each year. Csiszár and Csonka [73] presented a location
assessment for charging stations through the land-use approach. The uniqueness
of the approach relative to previous studies is that it assesses the feasibility of EV
usage at a macro level and the future location of a micro-level charging station
with a focus on land use. He and Kockelman [74] described the optimal location
identification in the United States to develop a charging station for EVs. The issue
is detailed as a blended number program, and an altered stream refueling area
model (FRLM) is unravelled by employing a branch-and-bound calculation.
Results reveal that the 60-mile-AER rate fluctuates between 31% and 65% as
one expands the station tally from 50 to 250 stations. Lee and Hur [75] created
a wind-powered EV charging station that adapts to various consumer charging
habits. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables
model forecasts hourly wind power yields. The model is created by adding exog-
enous variables like wind speed and lattice mix investigation recreation forms to
the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. The recommended tech-
nique for EV charging dispersion is approved using trial data from breeze culti-
vates on Jeju Island in South Korea. Sun and Gao [76] proposed a location
framework for charging stations considering the consumer’s travel discrepancy
properties. The model is structured into two parts, one for short-distance traveling
and the other for long-distance traveling, keeping in mind that long-distance tra-
velers should take less time to charge. A typical Chinese city is used as an example
to illustrate the implementation and results of the model. Kadri and Perrouault
[77] studied the charging station’s location and financial assessment and discussed
the expansion of the charging station’s capacity. Hosseini and Sarder [78] identi-
fied the optimal location of charging stations through the Bayesian network (BN)
model. This article provides a new study idea by including uncertainty and qual-
itative and quantitative parameters in the location assessment and presents the
typical penetration of BN as an influential decision-making tool in electrical power
management. Wang and Fe [79] described the location and capacity assessment of
EV charging stations by expanding network approaches. They achieved this by pla-
nning the areas and limits of charging offices under a fixed spending limitation and
handling the streamlining issue with a tweaked neighborhood search system.
A lower threshold for the framework cost is developed to assess the characteristics
of arrangements gained utilizing our proposed heuristic. Bai and Chin [80]
described location assessment for charging stations through a bi-objective model
using GPS trajectory data. The issue is defined as a bi-objective blended number,
numerical model, with one goal identified with limited expense and the other
identified with boosting administration quality. To fathom it, we propose a
10.6 Assessment of EV Charging Station
283

half-and-half developmental calculation consolidating the non-commanded
hereditary calculation with direct programming and neighborhood search.
10.6.2
Characterization of Charging Station
Many researchers are already working in this field, and Mehrjerdi [81] described
the concept of the micro-grid integrated EV charging station and gave a plan to
increase the capacity of this charging station. Solar, wind, gas turbine, and energy
storage systems are the resource components of micro-grid, which can increase its
capacity. Results show that if the capacity of the wind energy system is increased
by 200%, then the cost of the overall micro-grid system increases by 55%. Cost anal-
ysis of micro-grid-based EV charging stations is also done in this paper. Mehrjerdi
and Hemmati [82] created a solar-diesel battery-powered charging station that can
charge at three different levels: low, medium, and high. Low-, medium-, and high-
level charging are favored for two-, three-, and four-wheeled EVs, respectively,
mostly at the station. Because the solar energy resource influences the total char-
ging system’s performance, uncertainty owing to the intermittency of solar radia-
tion is also evaluated in this work. The solar energy system is thought to help with
the pollution problem in the atmosphere.
Ding and Lu [83] provided the best charging station scheduling to meet the
demand for two-, three-, and four-wheeled electric vehicles. The linear integer
optimization model highlights the link between customer demand and charging
station capacity. The results reveal that if the charging procedure is correctly
scheduled, the entire capital and operating cost is reduced by 75%. Mehrjerdi
and Hemmati [84] described wind-operated EV charging station modeling. The
charging station is integrated with a wind energy system as a primary source, a
battery as a storage medium, and a multivariable EV charging facility.
The uncertainty due to the wind velocity is also analyzed in this paper, and
the capacity of the low-, medium-, and fast-level charging is 116 kW, 84 kW,
and 52 kW, respectively. The overall cost of the system is $945/year, in which
network development and charging facility consume 15% and 12%, respectively,
of the overall cost of the system. Huang and Kockelman [85] analyzed elastic
demand, station congestion, and network equilibrium of the location of an
EV charging station. The genetic algorithm assesses technical parameters
and finds that consumers are willing to pay $6 for 30-minute charging of
EVs. Wang and Wang [86] explained the energy trading of EV charging stations
using the game theory concept. A multilevel charging facility is considered a
play of the game, and the payoff matrix shows that the overall cost is reduced
by 4%, and profit is increased in variable mode from 7.5% to 7.9%. Luo and Wu
[87] explained the coordination and allocation aspects of an EV charging sta-
tion in the distributed energy system. This paper proposed an optimization
284
10 Electric Vehicle Path Towards Sustainable Transportation

model between charging stations and distributed energy sources. A real urban
area fed by a 31-bus distribution network in China is chosen as a test method to
check the feasibility of the proposed optimization model, and their numerical
results are analyzed. He and Fathabadi [88] proposed a solar-fuel cell-operated
EV charging station. To cater to a high charging and discharging frequency and
the intermittent nature of the solar energy system, the effective charging station
battery is replaced by fuel cells, hydrogen tanks, and electrolyte capacitors. The
result shows that the fuel cell is a better alternative to the battery in terms of
operation and maintenance cost and overall performance. Schmidt et al.
described the utilization of battery-swapping approach to improve electric vehi-
cles’ environmental balance and price-performance ratio. The basic design of
hybrid vehicles, significant components, and various power train combinations
are addressed in applications and constraints. Table 10.3 shows the assessment
of different charging stations.

Gampa and Jasthi [99] analyzed all the technical and financial parameters of EV
charging stations using the Grasshopper optimization technique. Fuzzy logic also
allocates distribution sources, shunt capacitors, and EV charging stations. The
result shows that the 51- and 62-bus distribution network offer many advantages
over conventional energy system-operated EV charging stations. Mehrjerdi [100]
described an off-grid solar-powered charging station that charges hydrogen-
fuelled vehicles and normal EVs. This paper’s significant contribution is that elec-
tric and hydrogen vehicles can be charged simultaneously as one part of the solar
system handles the demand of EVs and the other part run a water electrolyzer to
produce hydrogen. The result shows that 95% of the overall cost of the charging
station is consumed in solar energy systems, and 97% of solar energy is converted
into hydrogen and storage media. Kabli and Quddus [101] explained the expansion
planning of green vehicle charging stations by stochastic programming techni-
ques. A multistage stochastic programming language is used to expand the capac-
ity of the charging station to cater to the increasing number of EVs day by day. The
technical and financial parameter of the charging station is assessed using a Pro-
gressive hedging algorithm. The result of this algorithm is also given considering
various managerial viewpoints for decision-makers. Quddus and Kabli [102]
described grid-green energy-operated green vehicle charging stations’ long-term
scheduling and short-term functional decision-making. A case study of Washing-
ton City is taken to analyze technical and financial parameters by Sample Average
Approximation with an enhanced Progressive Hedging Algorithm. The result
shows that the grid supply can meet load demand at a lower cost during the peak
charging time when a solar energy system is unavailable. Zhang and Liu [103]
described the optimum design of a solar power-operated EV charging station.
The key points of the case study in Beijing city are “rationalization, modularization
and an intelligentization of the fast charging station.” Zhang and Tang [104]
described the optimal green car charging station capacity expansion using whale
optimization techniques. An enhanced whale optimization approach (IWOA) is
presented in this research. This study extends the whale optimization algorithm
(WOA) by adding the Gaussian operator and simultaneously merging the differ-
ential evolution algorithm with the notion of a crowding factor in the artificial fish
swarm method’s back-end operations. Luo and Wu [105] proposed a collaborative
planning model based on the spatial scheduling problem of EV charging require-
ments and focused on the social cost equilibrium. A suitable second-order cone
programming relaxation is utilized to put the suggested model into a type to reduce
the complexity of the optimization model. Fathabadi [106] explained the feasibility
analysis, modeling, and controlling of totally autonomous nonconventional
energy-operated EV charging stations. Due to the intermittent nature of wind
velocity and solar radiation, the author proposed a hybrid solar-wind energy sys-
tem and a fuel cell storage system to avoid the intermittent nature of solar/wind
286

and the high battery system cost. Fuel cell is utilized to have an increased lifetime
and an overall expense of about $21,000 in place of a 6.5 kWh Li-particle battery
bank, giving a short lifetime of around 500 days and a complete expense of about
$70,000 for 30 years. It is stand-alone, fully autonomous, and 100 % green energy
due to the lack of any adverse environmental effects and the prospect of building
charging points in remote areas with no grid. The overall construction costs of the
charging station are roughly $99,500, with a payback period of just 16 months.
Huang and Ma [107] explained the concept of geographical information system-
based charging station in a highly dense area of Hongkong city using nonconven-
tional energy resources. Choosing the ideal areas and an ideal number of sustain-
able ones fuelled accusing stations of contemplating the current charging stations
and inexhaustible possibilities. Hafez and Bhattacharya [108] assessed the optimal
design of EV charging stations using various energy sources. Various energy
sources, such as nonconventional energy systems and diesel generation, have prac-
tical inputs on their corporeal, operational, and financial characteristics. The con-
figuration of the EVCS along the highways, as an independent microgrid, is being
examined to resolve the “range anxiety” issues of EV owners regarding the dis-
tance the vehicle will travel. Luo and Gu [109] planned to enhance the capacity
of EV charging stations through a multilevel charging facility. To illustrate the via-
bility and usefulness of the proposed solution, a natural urban area fed by a 31-bus
delivery network in China has been used as a testing ground, and the mathemat-
ical results are accessed and analyzed.
Outcomes: Much work has already been reported on EV charging stations. The
grid-solar hybrid system is a feasible solution for a charging station. The literature
reported is categorized into two categories: location identification for charging sta-
tions and capacity calculation and capacity expansion of charging stations. How-
ever, the concept of big data and decision science+ can be applied to location
assessment for charging stations, and a drone-based system may also be developed
to find a suitable location where sufficient amounts of solar radiation/wind veloc-
ity exist for solar/wind energy systems. Specific optimization techniques may also
be used for the optimum design of an EV charging station.
10.7
Worldwide Policy Framework for EV
Several assessment parameters such as fuel prices, incentives for zero- and low-
emission green vehicles, and financial instruments help bridge the cost gap
between electric and ordinary vehicles and offer incentives for electric mobility
in developed and developing countries. Policy support is gradually being applied
to tackle the strategic significance of the value chain of battery technology. Hu and

Wang [110] described EV diffusion due to the different policies in China. The find-
ings show that the government’s purchasing subsidy and restricted travel policies
will encourage a 60% diffusion rate for electric vehicles, and the short-term impact
is remarkable. Output subsidies and infrastructure-building policies will support
EVs’ 70% diffusion rate. Offering incentives to producers have a more significant
effect than offering buying incentives to customers. At the same time, low energy
and high oil rates would push the delivery rate of EVs to 60% and 70%, respectively.
Kong and Xia [111] explained the effect of the subsidy policy on the EV market in
China. This study examines the impact of several approaches, including commod-
ity subsidies, carbon emissions, trading and license plate restrictions, and policies
on EV sales as soon as the purchasing subsidy scheme is phased out in China.
Therefore, a system dynamics model is proposed, explicitly considering the rela-
tionship among government, businesses, and consumers.
Fang and Wei [112] analyzed China’s EV charging station-related policy
framework and incentives. The findings demonstrate the benefits of a balanced,
integrated subsidy and tax strategy for developing electricity charging infrastruc-
tures. It is noteworthy that investment is not the biggest obstacle to installing
charging stations. The main driving forces are EV penetration rates and the char-
ging price. Melton and Axsen [113] studied the policy framework for EVs in Can-
ada. The study provides a more detailed assessment method, taking into account
five criteria: (i) efficiency in long-term PEV adoption, (ii) government expendi-
ture, (iii) public holds up, (iv) policy flexibility, and (v) a transformational indi-
cation, which is a measure of the policy’s ability to increase interest and
investment in the PEV transition. Table 10.4 shows the policy assessment of dif-
ferent countries.
Wang and Tang [114] compared global incentive policies on the EV market. In
2015, the worldwide milestone of 1 million electric cars on the road surpassed 1.26
million, thanks to the political dividend. The subsidy system was deemed the most

relevant and successful incentive strategy. Numerous countries, like China, the
United States, and Germany, plan to eliminate electric car incentives. The findings
reveal that the number of charging stations, charging rate, and road conditions are
vital positive variables in the country’s EV market share.
On the other hand, fiscal incentives are no longer the primary cause of signifi-
cant disparities in promoting electric vehicles between nations. Capuder and
Sprcˇić [115] comprehensively reviewed the limitations and advantages of world-
wide EV policy. This paper offers a detailed overview of the political, cultural,
social, technological, law-making, and ecological aspects and rigorously assesses
the achievement of the objectives of EV integration. In addition to a comprehen-
sive literature review of all relevant factors, this paper introduces a hybrid
approach focused on finances and incorporates hazard supervision techniques.
Wee and Coffman [116] explained the pros and cons of the EV policy implemented
in the United States. This report outlines the length and importance of US State
and Local EV (EV) policies in force from 2010 to 2015. While the emphasis is
on state-level policies, municipal governments and energy company policies are
reported as they collectively represent most of the state’s population or energy cus-
tomers. Carley and Zirogiannis [117] highlighted the shortcomings of EV policy in
the United States and how to overcome them. Our research demonstrates a trade-
off between growing PEV market penetration and reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions from the fleet of light-duty cars. These two goals are in conflict, at least in the
near term, because of how federal and state policy interact. Egner and Trosvik
[118] outlined Sweden’s EV policy framework. The author discovers that providing
public charging sites enhances adoption rates, particularly in metropolitan areas,
and indicates that public procurement of battery electric vehicles might be a useful
policy tool.
A qualitative evaluation of the policy process on EVs in the Nordic Region was
presented by Kester and Noel [119]. To address the thinking and justifications
underlying EV incentives and policy frameworks, this article presents a compre-
hensive comparative analysis based on 221 semi-structured conversations with 251
transport and energy professionals from 203 organizations across 18 cities in the
Nordic area. Finally, this study advocates for clear, consistent, coherent goals and
pricing incentives, a more substantial commitment to EV awareness efforts, and
local freedom to give extra advantages. The multilevel policy mechanism of EV
in Germany was presented by Taefi and Kreutzfeldt [120]. By comparing and eval-
uating the groups’ rating findings, it is clear that their differences might be signif-
icant, providing valuable information and room for future research and practice.
Figenbaum [121] elaborated EV policy framework in Norway.
Norway has achieved an incredible milestone for electric car batteries. The
market share was 16.9% in 2014, and the total fleet was 2.6%, with around
10.7 Worldwide Policy Framework for EV

71,505 vehicles. Norwegian purchase incentives are significant enough to make
EVs a competitively priced option for car purchasers. Improved model range,
new technology, reduced vehicle prices, and robust marketing have driven further
sales. In an experimental form, Kwon and Son [122] studied the EV policy on Jeju
Island. Experiments have shown that, relative to prospective customers, the actual
owners of EVs demonstrated a greater inconvenience to charging time. For incen-
tives, EV owners have shown different preferences for different incentive measures.
Outcomes: The above data show that untill 2019, only 2–5% countries worked in
the field of EVs and their charging station, but in those countries, the perception of
their people is not very favorable regarding purchasing an EV at a higher cost com-
pared to the conventional vehicles. All over the world, it should be mandatory for
the individual government to create awareness about the EV and develop a policy
for EVs and charging stations in a form that is helpful to the people and creates lots
of employment opportunities for the young generation in the field of green
mobility.
10.8
Electric Vehicles on the Sustainability and
Reliability of Transportation Network
Electric vehicles can significantly improve the sustainability of the transportation
network. Electric vehicles emit fewer greenhouse gases than traditional gas-
powered vehicles. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, on average,
electric vehicles emit 60% less carbon dioxide than gas-powered vehicles. This
reduction in emissions can help to mitigate climate change and improve air quality
in urban areas. Electric vehicles are typically more energy-efficient than tradi-
tional gas-powered vehicles. Electric motors convert more energy stored in the bat-
tery into motion, whereas gas-powered engines waste energy through heat and
friction. Increased efficiency translates into reduced energy consumption and
lower costs. Electric vehicles can be used in conjunction with renewable energy
sources, such as solar panels, to create a more resilient and decentralized transpor-
tation network. This can help to reduce the impact of power outages and other
disruptions on the transportation network. Adopting electric vehicles can play
an important role in making the transportation network more sustainable. How-
ever, there are still challenges to overcome, such as the availability of charging
infrastructure, the cost of batteries, and the need for more sustainable sources
of electricity.
Electric vehicles (EVs) can positively and negatively impact the reliability of the
transportation network. Here are some potential ways in which EVs could impact
transportation reliability.
290
10 Electric Vehicle Path Towards Sustainable Transportation

Positive impacts
• Reduced dependence on fossil fuels: Since EVs run on electricity, they don’t
rely on fossil fuels for energy. This means that they can reduce the vulnerability
of the transportation network to disruptions in oil supply, such as oil price spikes
or geopolitical conflicts.
• Lower maintenance costs: EVs have fewer moving parts than internal com-
bustion engine vehicles, requiring less maintenance. This could reduce the
breakdowns and delays on the transportation network caused by mechanical
problems.
• More efficient use of road space: EVs are generally smaller and more com-
pact than internal combustion engine vehicles. This could allow for more effi-
cient use of road space, as more EVs can fit on the same stretch of road than
would be possible with larger vehicles.
Negative impacts
• Dependence on the electricity grid: Since EVs require electricity to operate,
they depend on the grid. This means that disruptions to the grid, such as power
outages or equipment failures, could impact the reliability of the transportation
network.
• Range anxiety: EVs typically have shorter ranges than internal combustion
engine vehicles, which means that drivers may need to plan their trips more
carefully to avoid running out of power. This could increase the risk of delays
or disruptions if drivers cannot find a charging station or if charging stations
are not functioning properly.
• Congestion at charging stations: If there are not enough charging stations to
meet demand, EV drivers may experience delays or disruptions while waiting for
a charging spot to become available. This could be particularly problematic in
urban areas where there is already limited space for parking and infrastructure.
10.9
Recent Trends and Future Challenges
In the recent scenario, EV technology is ice-breaking in the transportation sector,
and research shows that lots of work is needed to change people’s perceptions. Fur-
ther advanced research is required for the charging and discharging capability of
the battery system to increase the range of EVs. The government must take initia-
tives to develop a renewable energy-based EV charging station that do not create
an extra load on the power grid. The following points are proposed to create a
splendid environment for EVs.
10.9 Recent Trends and Future Challenges
291

• Solar energy-operated EVs with backup must be developed to mitigate environ-
mental problems such as pollution through greenhouse gases.
• Use of switched reluctance motors in place of conventional electric motors.
• A market basket model and fault tree analysis may be used for the reliability
analysis of EVs.

Introduction
In recent years, electric vehicles (EVs) have become very popular, thus, leading to an
increased demand for EV charging stations available to the drivers [1]. Apart from
charging the EVs at home, drivers can now charge their electric cars either while
parking on street or while parking within large parking structures. This creates a
new business opportunity for the operators of the parking structures; nevertheless,
it also creates challenging problems in terms of scheduling the charging of EVs
within the parking structure. For example, when several EVs are simultaneously
charging, this may add a significant strain on the power grid. Thus, intelligent sche-
duling techniques are needed in order to manage both the charging load as well as
the expectations of the customers and the parking structure operators. These expec-
tations can be expressed as specific quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and can
include metrics such as delay in departure time, satisfaction of charging demand,
operator monetary gain, etc., subject to the constraints imposed by the system under
consideration. This is the main motivation of this work, which tries to develop intel-
ligent charging scheduling algorithms for EVs that use large parking structures.
In the state of the art, several models for scheduling the charging of EVs have
been presented. These models, for the most part, fall under two control architec-
tures, namely decentralized and centralized [2]. In general, decentralized control
architectures are more flexible, as they allow the drivers themselves to make deci-
sions on when to commence and end their charging. However, such flexibility
comes at a price, as such a decentralized approach does not account for the total

charging load, potentially causing unacceptable outcomes, ranging from overload
of the power system to the waste of available resources. This, in turn, will have an
impact on all actors, i.e., parking operators will experience monetary losses and EV
drivers will be dissatisfied with their charging capacity or their departure time.
Due to the aforementioned drawbacks of the decentralized control architectures,
nowadays, centralized control architectures are regarded as the most favorable
techniques for scheduling the charging of EVs within large parking structures.
When centralized control architectures are utilized, a central decision manage-
ment (CDM) unit (for example, a computing unit hosted in the cloud) makes all
scheduling decisions using the input given by the drivers of the EVs [3,4].
Centralized solutions, since they have all necessary information regarding
charging needs, arrival and departure times, etc., can allow for the efficient
charging of all EVs via the implementation of smart scheduling techniques.
Further, they can be utilized for the development of novel costing approaches that
also increase the revenue of the parking operators.
Even though there are several approaches in the literature for addressing the
charging scheduling problem, fairness is not a common metric that is examined
(as described in the later section). Note that fairness can be investigated in terms
of several attributes such as departure delay, charged capacity, charging cost, etc.
Thus, this book chapter focuses on developing fair and efficient EV scheduling
schemes. We first briefly discuss existing scheduling schemes, and then we analyt-
ically describe scheduling schemes specifically targeting the fair allocation of the
available system resources to all the EVs that contend for these resources.
The main contributions of this work are the development of the “delay-fair” and
“QoS-fair” integer linear program (ILP) formulations and the design of delay-fair
and QoS-fair ant colony optimization (ACO)-based heuristic algorithms for
addressing the EV static (i.e., all arrivals/departures are known a priori) charging
scheduling problem in parking structures, with both ILP formulations and heur-
istics leveraging the α-fairness scheme. Extensive performance evaluation results
demonstrate a trade-off between fairness and efficiency, that gives flexibility to the
parking operator (i.e., through the value of α) to achieve a balance between its
needs and the needs of the car owners, subject to the system’s constraints.
11.2
EV Charging Management Schemes
Monitoring and controlling the EV charging process within a charging station is
important to achieve EV user satisfaction, reduce operational costs, and guarantee
power system stability [5]. EV charging management schemes are characterized by
the following three attributes: (i) mobility, (ii) coordination, and (iii) control [6].
302
11 Electric Vehicle Charging Management in Parking Structures

First, the mobility of an EV charging scheme is classified into static and dynamic.
Static charging schemes assume that all EVs are present in a station while charging
takes place [7,8], whereas dynamic charging schemes allow different system
“disruptions” (e.g., new EV arrival or parked EV departure) while charging
[9,10]. Although dynamic charging is more challenging and requires an advanced
charging infrastructure, it is closer to the real-world requirements [11].
Second, an EV charging scheme can be either coordinated or uncoordinated. The
coordinated method refers to a charging scheme that aims to optimize different
aspects of the system (e.g., reduce charging times, satisfy power demand, reduce
power losses, minimize daily electricity costs, etc.) [12,13] by coordinating the
decisions taken by the various system entities (in a centralized or a distributed
manner). In contrast, the uncoordinated method refers to a charging scheme in
which different tasks are independently decided by various system entities (e.g.,
EVs can start charging as soon as they are plugged) [14]. Clearly, the uncoordi-
nated method may satisfy some EV users; however, it is prone to power loss
and affects the reliability and efficiency of the system, as the various actions are
taken in an uncoordinated manner.
Third, there are two control strategies to manage the power flow of an EV char-
ging station, namely centralized and decentralized [15]. The former strategy pro-
cesses the information provided by the EVs and provides an optimal solution
for the overall system considering the user and system constraints [8, 9, 10, 16].
On the contrary, in the latter strategy, the EV users decide their charging schedule
depending on either their convenience, electricity cost, or both [17]. It should be
noted that the difference between coordinated/uncoordinated and centralized/dis-
tributed lies in the fact that distributed approaches may also be (partially) coordi-
nated (assuming that information is exchanged between [neighboring] system
entities), whereas uncoordinated methods are always distributed, as they do not
consider the use of a centralized control unit that would coordinate the
actions taken.
Furthermore, EV charging management schemes vary mainly according to their
optimization objectives. For example, authors in Refs. [8, 9, 10, 18] aim to mini-
mize the total tardiness of the EVs, authors in Refs. [19,20] focus on minimizing
the total electricity cost for charging the EVs, while the flattening of the overall
load profile (i.e., grid congestion) is examined in Ref. [21]. Multiple objectives have
also been considered in the state of the art; for example, the authors in Ref. [22]
aim to both minimize parking cost and concurrently maximize the charging sta-
tion’s efficiency for the case of plug-in EVs’ daily scheduling. In addition, other
works in the literature consider variable EV charging rates [21], variable station
charging power [23], or variable energy prices [24].
Recently, the problem of scheduling EV charging has been examined in [25] in
terms of fairness, where the aim is to obtain a resource allocation that is fair
11.2 EV Charging Management Schemes
303

concerning the charging levels that can be achieved by the EVs that contend for
energy resources over a specified time interval (i.e., our planning horizon, defined
in hours, days, etc.). Even though fairness in EV charging is viewed as a significant
policy by operators, in general currently the EV owners unilaterally make deci-
sions on their charging levels that mainly depend on human behavior (i.e., to
forego charging if their capacity level is satisfactory, or to only charge up to a spe-
cific level, thus allowing the charging of other vehicles that have lower capacity)
[26]. Nevertheless, explicitly addressing the fair resource allocation problem in
parking structures is very important for the charging infrastructure operators,
as it directly relates to the satisfaction of the EV users and their decisions concern-
ing re-using the specific infrastructure. Thus, in this work we focus on addressing
the gap in the literature concerning the fair scheduling problem for charging EVs
within parking structures through the development of fair charging techniques
that consider specifically two attributes, namely delay and QoS.
11.3
Fair Charging Management
A centralized EV charging management scheme is considered in this work, with
the assumption of a coordinated power flow and static charging, where in-
advanced reservations are possible. It is worth mentioning, however, that the static
scheduling scheme proposed, can also be used in dynamic systems by sequentially
solving a number of static problem instances that are shifted in time (i.e., as a
multi-period planning problem that can be solved, for example, hourly) [18].
The reader should also note that EV uncertainties (in terms of arrival times, char-
ging times, etc.) have not been considered in this work and are left as an interesting
avenue for future research work.
In particular, we consider a parking structure environment where a central
power source is connected through a power line with multiple parking/charging
spots (Figure 11.1). Specifically, the figure illustrates a simple charging station
comprised of two charging lines, and for each charging line there are several spots
where the owners can park their cars. Each parking spot doubles also as a charging
spot and is centrally controlled by the CDM. Thus, at each spot, the CDM can pro-
vide charging services to an EV by activating/deactivating the spot (active spots are
shown in orange color, while inactive spots are shown in black color in the figure)
to charge the EV up to a specified level. Thus, the role of the CDM is to coordinate
the activation/deactivation decisions for all EVs requesting charging services.
In this environment, due to limited power resources, and to avoid power link
overload (i.e., congestion) and potential power outages, it may be impossible to
fully charge all EVs within their finite stay time. While a solution to this problem
304
11 Electric Vehicle Charging Management in Parking Structures

is to maximize system efficiency, subject to the constraints imposed by the system,
this may leave some EV users unsatisfied (i.e., their EVs are not charged within
their stay time or they are experiencing extensive departure delays while waiting
to be charged). This clearly results in an unfair solution from the user’s point of
view, leading to the need for fair charging scheduling algorithms. Specifically, fair
charging scheduling algorithms are necessary to effectively control both power
link congestion and the achievable service quality of end-users.
As the fair scheduling problem and the rising efficiency-fairness trade-off [27]
have received considerable attention for various types of networks and applications
[28], including smart grids [29,30], communication networks [31–35], transporta-
tion networks [36–38], cloud and edge computing networks [39,40] amongst others,
several fairness measures have been proposed to capture the diverse fairness-
efficiency criteria in different environments, e.g., proportional fairness, max-min
fairness, Jain’s index, and Gini coefficient [28], with the most widely considered
measures being proportional and max-min fairness [28,41]. In general, proportional
fairness is considered when the target is to balance the efficiency-fairness trade-off,
while the max-min fairness is considered when the target is the fairest allocation
(i.e., achieving an equitable distribution of resources across the contending end-
users). Limitations, however, exist when committing to either one of these mea-
sures. Max-min fairness is likely to lead to inefficient system utilization (e.g., waste
of energy resources) and to an end-user’s maximum achievable service level that is
heavily degraded for the sake of equity (e.g., all EVs are experiencing extensive
delays for the sake of equity). Proportional fairness, on the other hand, is likely
CDM

lines and parking spots.
11.3 Fair Charging Management
305

to lead to conservative fairness levels, while fairer resource allocation solutions may
be possible that negligibly affect system efficiency and achievable service level.
Such limitations are alleviated by the α-fairness scheme [27]. In general, the
α-fairness scheme constitutes a unified framework where fairness is controlled
by changing a single parameter; that is, the inequality aversion parameter α.
Due to its flexibility, this scheme constitutes the basis for many resource allocation
problems encountered in various types of networks and applications [28].
11.3.1
Preliminaries on α-Fairness
The α-fairness scheme aims to maximize the constant elasticity welfare function
Fα, parameterized by α ≥0 [27], given by
Fα u =

In Eq. (11.1), u

+ denotes a utility allocation and ui equals the utility derived
by end-user i. An α-fair allocation (named π(α)), is an allocation where π α
argmaxuє Fα u , with
being the set that contains all utility allocations that
are feasible.
In general, the α parameter is used to control the rate at which marginal
increases diminish. In other words, with an increasing α fairer allocations can
be obtained; however, these allocations are likely to have a negative effect (i.e.,
reduce) the efficiency of the system. There are certain α values that are notewor-
thy, namely α = 0, α = 1, and α
∞. Specifically, α = 0 corresponds to maximizing
system efficiency, which, may, however, lead to unequal treatment among the
end-users contending for resources. For α = 1, the scheme corresponds to propor-
tional fairness, and for α
∞the scheme converges to max-min fairness; that is, it
converges to an allocation ensuring that the minimum allocated utility (i.e., satis-
faction of an end-user) is as high as possible.
11.3.2
Generic-Fair Energy Allocation Algorithm
Initially, we assume a simplified system, where n EVs contend for the available
resources (i.e., charging time slots) over a single power line, with this power line hav-
ing a capacity of m resource units (i.e., charging time slots or equivalently possible
resource allocations). Each EV requests a number of charging time slots over this
power line. Nevertheless, due to power line constraints, up to N charging spots can
be activated simultaneously (i.e., to avoid congestion), thus, leading to the possibility
that all EVs cannot be fully charged or that some EVs may experience delays in order
306
11 Electric Vehicle Charging Management in Parking Structures

for all EVs to be fully charged. Given that, the utility function U = [uij]
Rn × m,
over which the Fα function operates, is defined in such a way so as to declare the
EVs’ preferences over the m possible resource allocation decisions.
Specifically, uij captures the satisfaction of EV i when resource allocation deci-
sion j is taken over the fairness attribute of interest. As an example, when we are
interested in deriving a fair allocation concerning the delay that each EV will expe-
rience for the sake of fully charging all EVs (i.e., delay-fair), then decision j may
represent the first time slot when charging is activated (i.e., to ultimately capture
delay). Alternatively, when we are interested in deriving a fair allocation as it con-
cerns the charging level achieved, or equivalently according to the achievable
quality-of-service, of each EV (i.e., QoS-fair), then decision j may represent the
number of charging slots allocated to EV i.
Clearly, utility function U depends on the services provided by the system and on
how each EV “perceives” each possible resource allocation decision (i.e., how the
resource decision affects the satisfaction of the users). Hence, it must be carefully
designed. In this work, we examine both the delay-fair and the QoS-fair resource
allocation problems, for which U is appropriately designed. Specifically, we design
the following optimization problem:
max Wα u =
n
i = 1
m
j = 1
xijFα uij
11 2
subject to:
End −User and System Constraints
where x = [xij]
Rn × m are the Boolean variables to be optimized to find an energy
allocation that is either delay-fair or QoS-fair. In general, xij takes the value 1 if the
j-th resource allocation is selected for the i-th EV; otherwise, it takes the value 0.
Hence, a feasible allocation corresponds to a specific x
Rn that satisfies all the
end-user and system constraints.
11.4
Delay-Fair Charging Management
For the delay-fair charging management problem, the assumption is that EV
requests are initially dynamically accepted by the CDM (e.g., utilizing a 5G net-
work). Subsequently, reservations of parking spots and scheduling of charging
slots are performed for a specified future planning horizon. Thus, a request for
service, denoted as Si, is defined over the tuple Si =
ti, ti, ci , where ti and ti
are the corresponding times of arrival and departure, respectively, of EV i, and
ci is the EV’s charging level demand requirement.
11.4 Delay-Fair Charging Management
307

The allocation of a parking spot to an EV by the CDM, without loss of generality,
is performed using a first come first serve (FCFS) approach, provided that the
specific charging spot assigned is free and can be used for the entire time period
specified by the EV via the information provided through its reservation request.
For the delay-fair charging slot scheduling, the generic-fair energy allocation
algorithm (Section 11.3.2) is specifically designed taking into consideration two
(main) constraints for the EV and the system: (i) the number of EVs being charged
simultaneously cannot surpass a pre-defined value to avoid congestion and (ii) the
charging level that each EV can reach must be up to the demand that it has
requested.
Given this, it is clear that to charge all EVs up to their requested demand may be
impossible (i.e., due to congestion). As such, the delay-fair energy allocation algo-
rithm is designed to find a fair allocation concerning the delay experienced by EVs
contending for resources.
11.4.1
Optimal Algorithm: Delay-Fair
We first formulate the problem as an ILP utilizing the constants/variables as
described below:
Constants
• n: number of EVs to be serviced within the specified planning horizon.
• m: number of charging time slots within the specified planning horizon.
• N: maximum number of simultaneously active charging spots.
• A = [aij]
Rn × m: the arrival matrix; aij = 1 when the jth time slot is equal or
greater to the arrival time slot of the i-th EV, otherwise aij = 0. Hence, A is
formed according to the arrival time ti of each EV i (i.e., converted to the corre-
sponding time slot).
• D = [di]
Rn: the departure vector, where di is a constant indicating the last time
slot that EV i prefers to be present in the parking structure. Accordingly, D is
created based on the preferred departure time ti of each EV i.
• R = [ri]
Rn: the charging demand vector, where ri is a constant indicating the
number of requested charging times slots by EV i. Hence, R is formed according
to the requested charging time ci of each EV i.
• H = [hi]
Rn: the tolerance delay vector, where hi is a constant indicating the
number of time slots that EV i can tolerate after the departure time has elapsed
(i.e., after time slot di).
• U = [uij]
Rn × m: the utility matrix indicating the preferences of each EV over
the possible time slots that charging may be activated. Specifically, uij indicates
the level of satisfaction of EV i when charging starts at time slot indicated by
decision j. As the level of satisfaction of each EV i depends on the delay that
the EV user will experience, uij is computed according to Algorithm 11.1.
308
11 Electric Vehicle Charging Management in Parking Structures

According to Algorithm 11.1, utility values range between 1 and ε, where ε is a
small value used to ensure that uij
R+ for all i and j. Specifically, uij equals to 1 if
the charging procedure for EV i is activated upon a time slot indicated by decision j
that does not violate the EV’s preferred departure time di (i.e., the EV user is fully
satisfied as it is fully charged without experiencing any delay). Otherwise, utility
value uij starts decreasing up to ε to express that, as delay increases the EV user is
less satisfied. The worst value, ε, is used to express the fact that the delay of an EV
user i exceeds its tolerance delay hi.
Variables
• xij: Boolean variable; takes the value 1 if charging time slot indicated by decision
j is the first time slot used for charging the i-th EV amongst a set of contiguous
time slots allocated to that EV. Otherwise, it takes the value 0.
• yij: Boolean variable; takes the value 1 if charging time slot indicated by decision
j is used by the i-th EV. Otherwise, it takes the value 0.

The ILP aims to maximize Wα(u) [Eq. (11.3)], thus obtaining a utility allocation
that is delay-fair. Constraint (11.4) guarantees the selection of one utility allocation
per EV (i.e., charging is activated within one time slot), while constraint (11.5)
makes certain that the number of time slots allocated for charging by each EV
is the same as the ones requested. Constraint (11.6) is utilized to make sure that
no more than N charging spots are simultaneously activated, while constraint
(11.7) ensures the consideration of an EV’s arrival time during the allocation of
its corresponding charging time slots. Finally, constraints (11.8) and (11.9) ensure
that contiguous charging time slots are assigned for each EV.
11.4.2
Heuristic Algorithm: Delay-Fair
ACO is a popular metaheuristic that is known to provide high-quality outputs effi-
ciently when applied to challenging (
-hard) combinatorial optimization pro-
blems [42]. The sections that follow describe the different ACO components
that are specifically designed to coordinate the charging process of EVs while max-
imizing the welfare function of Eq. (11.1).
Initialization
Firstly, each artificial ant chooses in a random manner an EV (e.g., the i-th EV)
that in turn selects a utility allocation, i.e., based on decision j. Each choice of util-
ity allocation, uij, is related to a value for the pheromone trail, which is initialized
following a uniform distribution at the beginning of the execution as
τij
τ0,
i = 1, …, n,
j = 1, …m,
11 10
with τ0 denoting the initial pheromone trail value and τij denoting the pheromone
trail value associated with EV i for utility allocation j.
310
11 Electric Vehicle Charging Management in Parking Structures

Constructing Solutions
A complete solution of allocated utilities for all EVs is represented by each ant,
which is initially empty. Then, each ant selects a utility for each EV and incremen-
tally appends the selection to the solution. The constructed solution is completed
until all EVs are activated. Specifically, ant z selects EV i with a utility not
yet allocated in a random manner and an allocation value j based on the following
distribution:
pz
ij =
τij ηij
β
l N z
i
τil ηil
β , if j
N z
i ,
11 11
where N z
i denotes the set of feasible utility choices for the i-th EV, satisfying the
aforementioned constraints (11.6) and (11.7), ηij denotes the heuristic information
values that are associated with the i-th EV for feasible utility allocation value j (i.e.,
the “attractiveness” of assigning a utility value j for the i-th EV), and β (constant) is
used for controlling the influence of the heuristic information. Specifically, ηij is
computed by utilizing the welfare function as:

if α ≥0, α

11 12
Pheromone Update
In every iteration, the pheromone trails are updated based on the quality of the
constructed solutions. Specifically, because of pheromone evaporation, all phero-
mone trail values are initially decreased by a small value:
τij
1 −ρ τij,
i = 1, …, n,
j = 1, …m,
11 13
with ρ
(0, 1] is a constant denoting the evaporation rate. Subsequently, the pher-
omone trail values for the utility allocation selections of Tbest (i.e., the solution that
is constructed by the best ant [BA]), are reinforced as
τij
τij + Δτbest
ij
,
11 14
where Δτbest
ij
= 1 −1 Cbest
is the pheromone amount deposited by the BA and
Cbest is the quality of Tbest, which is computed by maximizing the objective func-
tion (i.e., welfare function Wα u – Eq. (11.1)). Since it is possible that W α u may
take negative values, windowing is utilized (i.e., adding the lowest quality value
solution to all remaining solution quality values and adding a very small constant
11.4 Delay-Fair Charging Management
311

so as not to have zero values). The “best” ant that can deposit pheromone is either
the best-so-far ant (BSFA) (i.e., the ant representing the best-so-far solution
amongst all iterations and, thus, may not necessarily be part of the constructing
colony at the current iteration), hence Cbest = Cbs = Cbest so far, or the iteration-best
ant (IBA), hence Cbest = Cib = Citeration best. By default, the IBA deposits pheromone
at each iteration, while the BSFA deposits pheromone from time to time (in this
work, this is done every 25 iterations) [43].
MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS) [44], one of the best-performing ACO algo-
rithms, is the basis for the pheromone update policy. For this policy, lower and
upper limits are imposed on the pheromone trail values as follows:
τij
τmax,
if τij > τmax,
τmin,
if τij < τmin,
τij,
otherwise,
i = 1, …, n,
j = 1, …, m,
11 15
where τmax and τmin are the maximum and minimum pheromone trail
values, respectively. Thus, excessive accumulation of pheromone trail values
will not occur, preventing stagnation behavior. In addition, pheromone trail
re-initialization is implemented whenever there is no improvement in the
solution quality.
11.4.3
Results and Main Outcomes
The delay-fair energy allocation algorithm was evaluated according to the EV pro-
files (i.e., requests Si) of a real-world benchmark [18] that includes arrival times
(ti), departure times (ti), and demands ci for a 24-hour planning horizon. The pla-
nning horizon is in this work discretized according to a 10-min interval. Note that
the exact instances considered for the results are available at [45]. Briefly, both
algorithms are evaluated for n = 15,20 EVs, m = 196 charging time slots,
N = 3,5, respectively, and ε = 10−6. Charging demand vector R is formed according
to the discretized real ci demands, arrival matrix A is formed according to ti, and
departure vector D is formed according to ti. Finally, the tolerance delay vector H is
formed by randomly sampling an integer number between the intervals [5, 29] for
each EV. For the ACO approach, the colony size (ω) is set to n, while the rate of
evaporation (ρ) and the decision rule parameter (β) are explored for a number of
values, with ρ = 0.2 and β = 2 having a performance that is close to the optimal
delay-fair allocations.
Specifically, Table 11.1 shows that ACO and ILP only slightly deviate in the opti-
mization (Wα) results for most of the values of α explored. In the table, “best”
denotes the minimum value, “worst” denotes the maximum value, “mean”
denotes the average value, and “stdev” denotes the standard deviation value, with
these values obtained from 10 independent runs for the ACO approach. Note that
312
11 Electric Vehicle Charging Management in Parking Structures

the maximum deviation encountered is approximately 15% for n = 15 and α = 1,
while the overall deviation is negligible given the significant savings in processing
time that ACO achieved. Specifically, regarding the processing time, ILP requires
21 minutes (2.5 hours) for n = 15 (n = 20), while ACO requires 0.5 minutes
(0.9 minutes) for n = 15 (n = 20), with ACO resulting up to 99% savings in proces-
sing time.
Importantly, both ILP and ACO are evaluated for various other measures,
including
fairness
with
respect
to
the
delay
that
each
EV encounters
(Figure 11.2) and total delay (Figure 11.3). Specifically, delay-fairness is evaluated
according to the coefficient of variations metric [46] over α (CVα), with CV mea-
suring the variability of delays the EVs experience around the mean delay value. In
brief, Figure 11.2 illustrates that delay-fairness improves with an increasing α for
both (ILP and ACO) approaches (i.e., lower CV values imply fairer allocations).
Hence, higher α values are shown to schedule the time that each EV starts to
charge in a fairer manner.
However, fairness comes at the expense of high total delay times that may be
encountered as α increases (Figure 11.3). Note that the total delay is computed
as the sum of delays for all EVs, given the EVs’ starting charging time (i.e., the
allocation) and the EVs’ demand (i.e., ri). Specifically, the impact of α on the total

delay is shown in Figure 11.3, illustrating that fairer allocations result in extensive
delays, consequently also affecting the individual end-user delays (i.e., a fairer allo-
cation may increase the individual delays for the sake of equity).
Thus, it is important that the operator examines both fairness and delay over
several α values to effectively balance the delay-fairness trade-off. As an example,
the operator may choose the scheduling solution for α = 2 when n = 15 EVs are
considered, since, for this case, delay is negligibly affected (Figure 11.3), while fair-
ness is shown to improve (Figure 11.2). In general, the presence of delay may not
be considered acceptable by end-users; thus, in the next section, we also examine
the QoS-fair charging management in the presence of hard constraints on the
departure time of the EVs.

11 Electric Vehicle Charging Management in Parking Structures

11.5
QoS-Fair Charging Management
For the QoS-fair charging management scheme, similar to the delay-fair case, we
assume that the EV requests are dynamically accepted by the CDM that subse-
quently carries out both reservations of parking spots and scheduling of charging
slots for a given future planning horizon. Thus, in this case a service request Si is
defined over the tuple Si =
ti, ti, cmn
i
, cmx
i
, where ti and tiare as previously defined
in Section 11.4, and cmn
i
, cmx
i
are the minimum and maximum charging level
requirements of EV i, respectively.
Without loss of generality, the CDM again makes an allocation of parking spot to
an EV on an FCFS basis, provided it is not used by another vehicle for the entire
time period stated within the EV’s reservation information, and that it is possible
to charge the EV, at least up to its minimum capacity requirement. The CDM,
before accepting an EV request, has first to examine whether the minimum char-
ging requirement can be achieved, given the previously admitted EVs into the sys-
tem. For the admission step, the algorithm analytically described in Ref. [25] can
be used, which was shown to be capable of deciding in real time whether an EV
request should be admitted to the system or not.
Regarding the QoS-fair energy allocation algorithm, this is executed periodi-
cally, to consider for the EVs that are admitted into the system for a predefined
future planning horizon. Specifically, the CDM runs the QoS-fair algorithm in
order to (in-advance) schedule when the charging spots for each accepted EV
are activated/deactivated, subject to the following (main) EV/system constraints:
(i) the number of charging spots that are activated simultaneously cannot be
greater than a predefined number (to avoid congestion) and (ii) each EV’s capacity
must at least reach its minimum charging demand requirement. In order to avoid
delays, the time period designated for an EV’s charging must be within the EV’s
arrival and departure times.
Given the aforementioned constraints, it is clear that to charge all EVs up to their
requested demand, without any delays, may be impossible (i.e., due to congestion).
Therefore, the QoS-fair energy allocation algorithm is designed to find a fair allo-
cation as it concerns the achievable QoS that each EV enjoys (i.e., according to the
satisfaction of EVs over their state-of-charge after service).
11.5.1
Optimal Algorithm: QoS-Fair
In the case of the ILP-based QoS-fair energy allocation algorithm, constants n and
N are as previously defined in Section 11.4, while additional constants are defined
as follows:
• m: the maximum number of charging time slots that an EV may request.
• k: the number of time slots in the planning horizon considered.
11.5 QoS-Fair Charging Management
315

• vmn
i : the minimum charging demand (in terms of the number of time slots used
for charging) of EV i, computed according to cmn
i
.
• vmx
i : the maximum charging demand (in terms of the number of time slots used
for charging) of the i -th EV, computed according to cmx
i .
• L = [lis]
Rn × k: the contention matrix, where lis = 1 if ti ≤s ≤ti, and 0 other-
wise, i = 1, …, n,
s = 1,., k. Hence, L indicates which EVs contend for the same
charging slots (i.e., are simultaneously present in the parking structure).
• V = [vij]
Rn × m: the resource matrix, where vij = j if j ≤vmx
i , otherwise vij = 0
(i.e., utilized to make certain that an EV is not assigned a number of charging
time slots that is greater than the ones requested).
• U = uij
Rn × m
+
: the normalized resource matrix, with
uij = vij
vmx
i
if vij > 0,
uij = ε
otherwise,
11 16
where ε is a small value, so that any uij
R+. This utility function represents
the percentage of satisfaction of an EV i, when allocated vij charging time slots
with respect to the maximum resources requested. Specifically, 0 < uij ≤1, with
1 signifying that EV i is fully satisfied when allocated resources that are equal to
or exceed its maximum charging demand vmx
i .
Regarding the variables, these are defined as follows:
• xij: Boolean variable; takes the value 1 if the j-th allocation is selected for the i-th
EV. Otherwise, it takes the value 0.
• yis: Boolean variable; takes the value 1 if charging time slot s is used by the i-th
EV. Otherwise, it takes the value 0.
• zis: Boolean variable; takes the value 1 if the s-th charging time slot is the first
time slot used for charging the i-th EV amongst a set of contiguous time slots
allocated to that EV. Otherwise, it takes the value 0.
To this end, the optimization algorithm is formulated as follows.

The ILP aims to maximize Wα(u) (11.17), thus obtaining an energy allocation
that is QoS fair. In this formulation, with constraint (11.18) we ensure that we
choose one energy allocation decision for each EV, with constraint (11.19) we
ensure that the number of charging time slots allocated is the same as the one spe-
cified by the resource allocation decision implemented, and with constraints
(11.20) and (11.21) we make certain that the allocations of charging time slots
for the EVs at least meet (i.e., they are greater than or equal to) their required min-
imum charging level without, however, exceeding their maximum charging level
requirement. Further, constraint (11.22) is used to ensure that no more than N
charging spots can be in use at the same time, constraint (11.23) is used to ensure
that the charging time for an EV is within a time window that is specified by the
arrival- and departure-time information for that EV, and constraints (11.24),
(11.25), and (11.26) make certain that contiguous charging time slots are assigned
for each EV.
11.5.2
Heuristic Algorithm: QoS-Fair
The same ACO algorithm described in Section 11.4.2 is applied in this scenario as
well, with the only difference being that the utility allocation now represents serv-
ice time rather than activation time. Furthermore, the N z
i set of feasible utility
choices for EV i in (11.11) must now satisfy constraints (11.20), (11.21), and
(11.22). Finally, the pheromone update policy of the ACO is the same as described
in Eqs. (11.13)–(11.15).
11.5.3
Results and Main Outcomes
The QoS-fair energy allocation algorithm is again evaluated according to the EV
profiles (i.e., requests Si) of the same real-world benchmark [18] that includes
11.5 QoS-Fair Charging Management
317

arrival times (ti), departure times (ti), and demands cmx
i
for a 24-hour period. Infor-
mation on the parameters considered for solving both the ILP and ACO are ana-
lytically given in Ref. [25], while the exact instances are available in Ref. [45].
Briefly, both algorithms are evaluated for n = 20(25) EVs, with k = 144, m = 44
(53), N = 4(5), and ε = 10−4. The maximum charge demands vmx
i
correspond to
the discretized real cmx
i
demands, while the minimum charge demands vmn
i
are
computed as the 10% of vmx
i
for all EVs. Finally, matrix L is created in accordance
with the discretized planning horizon, given ti and ti. For the ACO, the colony size
(ω) takes the value n, while the evaporation rate (ρ) and decision rule parameter
(β) are examined for various values, with β = 5 and ρ = 0.02 providing a near-
optimal solution [25].
Specifically, the ACO allocations are compared with the optimal ILP allocations,
for various measures of interest, including the processing time, fairness
(Figure 11.4), and efficiency (Figure 11.5) of the QoS-fair allocations over several
values of α. Fairness is evaluated according to the coefficient of variations (CVα)
metric [25, 46], measuring the fairness of an α -fair allocation with respect to
the unserved charging demand that EVs experience. Efficiency (Eα), is measured
as the sum of utilized charging time slots (i.e., Eα(u) =
iui, where ui
π(α)).
Regarding the processing time, ILP requires 18.3 hours (54 hours) for n = 20
(n = 25), while ACO requires 1.6 minutes (3.1 minutes) for n = 20 (n = 25), with
ACO resulting in up to 99% savings in processing time. Importantly, for the case of
the ILP, the processing time does not scale with the number of the EVs, while ACO
is shown to be executed within minutes, for all n values. Thus, ACO constitutes a
good alternative approach for problem sizes where ILP is rendered impractical,

especially as it obtains near-optimal results (deviating from the ILP by only up to
7%) in both QoS-fairness (Figure 11.4) and efficiency (Figure 11.5) measures. Note
that the processing time signifies the time it takes to derive allocations for α up to 8
(i.e., the value at which efficiency (Figure 11.5) starts degrading), and thus higher α
values would not be desirable by the parking operator and are thus not examined.
Importantly, Figure 11.4 illustrates that QoS-fairness improves with increasing α
for both the ILP and ACO approaches. Larger α values are shown to divide the
available charging time slots among the EVs that contend for resources in a fairer
manner; this is contrary to the greedy approach for allocating resources (i.e., for
α = 0), which only aims at maximizing system efficiency. The impact of α on
the system efficiency is shown in Figure 11.5, illustrating that fairer allocations
(in this case, α > 5 for both instances) result in efficiency degradation, conse-
quently affecting the operator’s revenue (i.e., this is the price to pay for fairness).
In general, by investigating both the fairness and efficiency metrics over various
values of α, a parking structure operator can effectively balance the trade-off
between efficiency and fairness through an appropriate selection of a value for
α that is the most suitable for meeting the requirements set by both the operator
as well as the owners of the EVs.
Finally, the reader should note that, concerning a direct comparison between
the delay- and QoS-fair algorithms, this cannot provide any additional informa-
tion, as different metrics are targeted. However, as demonstrated by the discussion
in both Sections 11.4.3 and 11.5.3, CVα follows the same trend for both cases as α
increases, the savings in processing time when ACO is used is similar, and so is the

ciency is shown in both, albeit at different α values.

Closing Remarks
While several EV charging management schemes for parking structures have been
previously examined in the literature, under diverse technologies and optimiza-
tion objectives (e.g., optimizing total delay, energy cost, balancing congestion),
in this work we explicitly examine the fair charging management problem. Specif-
ically, we examine the delay-fair and QoS-fair charging management problems,
ultimately aiming to fairly divide the available energy resources to the EVs that
contend for these resources, that is, targeting to improve the end-user satisfaction
over the services they enjoy.
Overall, the main achievements of this work are the development of the delay-
fair and QoS-fair ILP formulations and ACO-based heuristic algorithms leveraging
the α-fairness scheme, and the performance evaluations of both the optimal and
heuristic-based solutions in terms of fairness and also system efficiency. In general,
for both targets, results reveal the trade-off between fairness and efficiency. In
essence, a parking operator can choose the solution (i.e., by an appropriate selec-
tion of the α value) that best meets its needs (i.e., end-user satisfaction, operator’s
revenue, etc.).
As a fairly simplistic scenario for the charging station is utilized in the perfor-
mance results that are presented in this work, a possible future direction is to
include charging stations that are connected via several lines and with different
charging rates. Further, novel pricing schemes can be developed that reflect
end-user satisfaction, and the multi-period planning problem can be examined
over planning horizons that are relatively short (e.g., hours). Finally, there are a
number of metrics that can be used when examining fairness in charging. Thus,
an interesting avenue for future research is to capture fairness and end-user sat-
isfaction over other attributes such as charging cost for each EV owner.

Introduction
It is vital to look for new potential sources of energy due to the destruction of
the environment and the scarcity of petroleum-based fuels. Additionally, although
traditional fuels are finding it challenging to achieve these criteria, cars that utilize
petroleum-based fuels must comply with increasingly strict emission rules. The
amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has grown from the pre-industrial era’s
280 ppm to the current level of 350 ppm as a result of the use of different fossil

fuels like coal and petroleum products [1]. The use of conventional fuels continues
to increase CO2 levels, which causes the greenhouse effect, acid rain, pollution,
and global climate change [2].
To prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change, according to the IPCC’s
Fifth Assessment Report, the world must phase out the use of fossil fuels in energy
generation by the end of thiscentury and cut their usage to 20% by 2050 [3]. Addi-
tionally, it was said that if nations do not reduce greenhouse gas emissions to
almost zero by the year 2100, the effects of climate change will be severe, wide-
spread, and permanent. To keep the increase in the world temperature below
2 C from the level of 1800, a decrease in emissions of 40–70% is also anticipated
globally between 2010 and 2050, with a drop to zero or below zero by 2100 [3].
This inherent problem has motivated academics to look for an alternative,
environment-friendly fuel that would cut down on the import of crude oil from
oil-importing countries like India, thereby improving the economics of the nation
and greatly reducing emissions.
The main goal of the “multi-energy system” is to develop an open, interactive, and
smart energy supply system by resolving challenges with numerous energies inter-
action, coordination, and sharing. The “multi-energy system” actually organizes and
optimizes linkages on energy production, transportation, distribution, transfer,
storage, and consumption via integrating the various energy and consumer sectors
is primarily intended to completely decarbonize the environment [4]. Different
energy sources will cohabit in this way to achieve the objectives of comprehensive
combining and high-efficiency utilization.
To reduce CO2 emissions and protect the environment, multi-energy systems
are the only option. It is a more advanced technique of energy supply. It is a pat-
tern that offers a variety of energy products, including power, heating, and cool-
ing. The multi-energy system does not only combine or add different resource
types. It is a development based on conventional energy uses that have lessened
its drawbacks.
12.1.1
Objectives
Most of the IITS prevailing nowadays use electricity from the grid to operate the
system. To provide a sustainable IITS incorporation of the renewable energy sys-
tem is necessary and the main issue is the energy management of such systems.
Energy management solutions for heat-power systems, power management in
hydro-power systems, and gas-power systems were examined by researchers. It
was also reported that connection between transportation networks and electric
vehicles [5]. The investigation on multi-energy system management in transpor-
tation aspects was quite minimal and further research needs to be carried out on
transportation energy management, particularly in terms of decreasing economic
326
12 Multi-Energy Management Schemes for the Sustainability

and environmental issues confronting the energy sectors. To provide some solu-
tions to the above issues, objectives are defined as follows.
• To assess the energy needs for IITS and the potential of renewable energy
resources based on the data collection and travelerinformation in the particular
field.
• To identify the influencing factors for IITS in terms of both financial and non-
financial.
• To analyze the various perspectives of multi-energy management schemes for
the sustainability of IITS.
12.1.2
Distributed Energy Generation
It primarily consists of advanced heat pump technology, low-cost commercial fuel
cells, micro-gas turbine power generation technology, variable-speed constant-
frequency wind power generation technology, and large-scale photovoltaic and
solar thermal power generation technology [6]. More focus is being placed on
the development of energy conversion stations, energy hubs, smart energy, meter-
ing equipment at the customer end, and transportation networks based on smart
electric cars.
12.1.3
Energy Storage Technology
In multi-energy systems, energy storage technology addresses the discrepancy
between producing power and load power as well as the mismatch between reac-
tion times of various power suppliers. Battery storage, compressed air storage, and
other forms of power storage are used as forms of energy storage in multi-energy
systems [7]. Energy storage technologies also cover the conversion and storage of
electrical energy as well as other energy types such as electrochemical energy
storage, heat storage, hydrogen storage, and electric vehicles. Multiple energy
networks, including electricity grids, natural gas pipeline networks, cooling and
heating energy networks, and transportation networks, can be connected by using
different energy storage techniques.
12.1.4
Integrated Energy Management System
The three primary management components of integrated energy management
are transaction center, distributed power supply, and user load. To guarantee the
efficient and reliable operation of multi-energy systems, the energy flow is
controlled by the information flow. The core modules for multi-energy systems
include forecasting, analysis, and decision-making links, grid, renewable
energy, non-renewable energy, energy storage systems, and various energy loads.
12.1 Introduction
327

This is done through the establishment of a system platform for analytical
processing and global optimization management. An acceptable conversion plan
for energy output and various energy sources is created at the energy supply
end to carry out organic integration, and multi-dimensional comprehensive
decision-making [2, 8].
To increase the capacity of renewable energy consumption, meet energy
conservation and emission reduction goals, and encourage a change in energy
structure, a multi-energy complementary integrated optimization system may
be constructed.
12.2
History of Transportation System – Overview
The history of transportation traces back to the prehistoric era and has evolved.
The human foot served as the initial mode of transportation. To get anywhere, peo-
ple used to travel long miles on foot. Travel times dropped as innovative solutions
to transportation issues were found while carrying greater and heavier cargo
became possible. Researchers in the field of transportation are constantly coming
up with new ideas to save costs and improve efficiency [9]. The development of
international trade in the pre-modern era was the primary driver of advances in
global transportation [9].
In the twenty-first century, smart cities have gained global attention and many
cities have started initiatives to transform into smart cities. For example, the
Indian government started the Smart Cities Mission, in which they chose 100 cities
for the Smart City Mission Project; as of now, 5002 of the 7742 projects have been
completed [9]. China has already more than 500 smart cities [10]. IITS plays a vital
role in the transportation sector of smart cities. Therefore, eventually, IITS or
smart transport, or smart mobility improve the quality of life. Consequently,
energy and greenhouse gas reduction are key benefits, and it is taken in cost
analysis to justify IITS projects.
12.3
Concept of IITS
IITS integrates people, road, and vehicle design to improve road safety, and
comfort as well as environmental conservation with the help of information
and communication technologies [11]. IITS uses information and communication
technology to enhance transportation services and lowering traffic, accidents, and
air pollution through the effective utilization of existing transportation facilities
[11]. The IITS network is focused on meeting the transportation demands of
328
12 Multi-Energy Management Schemes for the Sustainability

current and future generations to support economic growth and minimize its
negative environmental impacts. Based on information control and electronics
technology, IITS includes a wide range of wireless and wireline communication
networks [12]. Figure 12.1 presents a schematic representation of the overview
of IITS.

12.3.1.1
Data Acquisition System
Sensors, automated vehicle identification (AVI), and GPS are included in the data
acquisition system. Traffic metrics like vehicle count, occupancy, and speed are
obtained via sensors [12]. To specifically identify a car and its speed on the road,
AVI systems are employed. The real-time location and speed of the vehicle are
determined by GPS technology. With the use of GPS systems, travel time, speed,
distance, and delay are estimated.
12.3.1.2
Data Communication System
Information gathered by the data acquisition system must be properly communi-
cated to the control centers and display devices. The majority of the time, data
communication systems use wireless technology [14].
12.3.1.3
Data Management System
For producing clean signals, data captured from acquisition systems need to have
the error signals removed. Once the data is cleaned of error signals, it can be aggre-
gated and analysis is then carried out to produce effective traffic management
plans and predict traffic conditions [13].

Display System
Information is provided to travelers utilizing display systems, such as message
signs, radio, SMS, etc. Information on journey times, speed, delays, accidents,
and other topics is available from IITS [15].
12.4
Barriers to Successful Implementation of IITS
The IITS network will add a new level of monitoring and control to the transport
system with adequate planning and coordination. However, for the successful
implementation of IITS, one needs to overcome financial constraints and non-
financial constraints, namely, institutional, technical, and physical constraints.
Figure 12.3 represents the major divisions of barriers related to IITS.
12.4.1
Financial Constraints
The major financial constraint for IITS is the huge investments needed to install
the system in society. The infrastructure, such as traffic detectors, roadside infor-
mation displays, IoT-based communication systems, GPS tracking systems, etc.,
would require significant investment. Later investment might also be essential
for the system’s ongoing upgrading, as well as for its proper use in operation
and maintenance.

12.4.2
Non-Financial Constraints
Non-financial constraints include Institutional (focuses on organizational, legal,
and policy-forming aspects), technical, and physical constraints (including infra-
structure, equipment, and devices) [16].
12.4.2.1
Institutional Constraint
Due to the participation of various stakeholder groups, a structured framework
that outlines the duties of each stakeholder is necessary. All stakeholders should
be notified regarding the standard operating procedure to avoid wrong communi-
cation [10].
12.4.2.2
Technical Constraint
To deploy smart mobility solutions, technical capability is required for data collec-
tion, data integration, data management, data analysis, and information service
provision. Data collected through sensors, cameras, and field operators’ survey
devices contain errors and, according to officials in Barcelona, error correction
devices are quite expensive [8]. For instance, AutoNavi, a navigation software used
in China, uses real-time speed data collected by the company personnel using GPS
[8]. Hence, a standardized data format and procedure is needed to reduce the data
integration process. Otherwise, adopt a common platform as in the case of City
SDK in Europe. Furthermore, keeping in touch with current technology develop-
ment and maintenance of the existing established system is the key technical
constraint faced by the IITS [10].
12.4.2.3
Physical Constraint
The basic construction for the operation of IITS solutions is a coherent road archi-
tecture. The cost of implementing intelligent mobility solutions would be high if
the road network was fragmented, far-flung, and disconnected.
The rest of the physical conditions are rather simple. There must be a specialized
physical infrastructure in place for data gathering and communication for a given
smart mobility application, say Wi-Fi on the bus. All the physical systems and
equipment need regular maintenance [17].
12.5
Intelligent Modern Energy Transport Systems
Modern wireless, electronic, and automated technologies are used in intelligent
transportation systems (ITSs). These technologies can combine infrastructure,
users, and vehicles all at once. Automated guideways, collision avoidance
systems, and precise bus docking are just a few examples of automated and
332
12 Multi-Energy Management Schemes for the Sustainability

in-vehicle technologies. They can aid in trip optimization, reducing unnecessary
miles traveled, increasing the usage of other modes of transportation, decreasing
time spent in traffic, reducing reliance on foreign oil, and improving air quality.
Transportation authorities must get ready for the future by taking into account
how roads are used now and how connected and autonomous vehicles will affect
them. Imagine if every vehicle sent a signal when it encountered a pothole, pro-
viding transportation authorities with precise information about the state of the
roads. It will give knowledge that will assist in solving immediate problems in the
short term. This knowledge could eventually help with the construction of better
roadways.
Developing technologies are opening up new opportunities in the field of IoT
and 5G communication technologies. Any physical machine can be equipped with
low-cost sensors and controllers that can be used for remote control and manage-
ment. They offer the quick connectivity required for running real-time, transpor-
tation systems with minimal lag.
Modern ITS systems manage the secure processing of streaming time-series
data, prompted by the connected real-time data sources, withstanding the advan-
tages of integrating the many computer models available today to support trans-
portation management. Sensors in intelligent vehicles and transportation systems
are two examples of these streaming data sources. The institution directly in
charge of managing transportation in a specific area might use its IT infrastructure
and resources to pre-process the gathered data locally. However, the data and
metadata are frequently transferred to external systems such as cloud computing
together with the preliminary analysis findings so that they can perform a more
thorough study and return alerts on potential threats and anomalies. All of this
highlights the complexity of IITS systems and highlights their potential for loca-

Implementation of Futuristic Transportation Technologies
12.5.1.1
Collection of Data
Real-time precise observation and quick data collecting are required for the
planning of an intelligent transport system. The information is gathered using
a variety of hardware tools that serve as the foundation for future ITS opera-
tions. These include sensors, cameras, automatic vehicle locators with GPS,
automatic vehicle identifiers, and more. The hardware primarily keeps track
of data like traffic volume, speed, position, vehicle type, and delays among
other things. These physical components are linked to the servers, which are
often found at the data collection center and store a significant amount of data
for later analysis.

12.5.1.2
Data Communication
This aspect of ITS involves transmitting data collected in the field to management
centers for analysis, and then management centers providing that information
back to travelers. Quick and real-time information transfer is the key to proficiency
in ITS implementation. Travelers are informed of announcements about traffic via
the Internet, SMS, or onboard units of vehicles.
12.5.1.3
Analysis of Data
The information that was gathered and received by management centers is then
processed further in several phases. These processes include data cleansing, data
synthesis, error correction, and adaptive logical analysis. Data inconsistencies
are found using specialist tools and fixed. The data is then further modified
and gathered for analysis. This corrected aggregate data is further examined to
forecast traffic scenarios that are available to provide consumers with pertinent
information.
12.5.1.4
Travelers’ Information
The management system provides real-time data on things like trip time, travel
speed, delay, traffic accidents, route changes, detours, and the state of work zones,
among other things. A variety of technology devices, including variable message
signs, highway advisory radio, the Internet, SMS, and automated cell phones, are
used to distribute this information. The number of vehicles on the road is rising
because of urbanization. The only answer is to apply an ITS to create a situation
where both residents and city officials benefit.
12.6
Role of Multi-Energy Management Schemes
for the Sustainability of Transportation Networks
In general, all energy systems are considered multi-energy systems meaning
that numerous energy sectors interact at various levels. For instance, consider-
ing a conventional power plant, coal is used as fuel to produce electricity and
must be transported to every plant, which describes the interconnection
between the coal and electricity. Similarly, in the case of air conditioning also
one can observe these kinds of connections [18–20]. Nevertheless, the energy
connection across multiple systems are typically minimal when compared to
the relationship inside a single energy system and that is the main reason past
studies on power system focused only on electrical energy. In recent days, coor-
dination between multiple energy systems such as the electric-gas energy
334
12 Multi-Energy Management Schemes for the Sustainability

system, the transportation-power system, and management focused frequently
[5, 21]. Therefore, traditional energy management for a single energy system
may become obsolete in the future, which motivates multi-energy management
study.
Researchers investigated the energy management strategies for heat-power
systems [22], power management in hydro-power systems, and gas-power sys-
tems [23, 24]. Furthermore, the connection between transportation systems and
electric vehicles was also reported [25, 26]. The preceding investigation has pro-
vided a new viewpoint on multi-energy management analysis, especially in the
view of reducing economic and environmental problems faced by the transpor-
tation sectors. The main benefits of multi-energy management schemes for the
sustainability of transportation networks are as follows:
1) Improves utilization of primary energy sources and the overall energy effi-
ciency of the system by the effect of multi-energy management. Let us con-
sider an example; waste heat generated during conventional electricity
production can be used for heating services which enhances the system’s
efficiency.
2) Improved use of diverse energy resources across many system levels.
3) The coordination of multiple energy systems increases system flexibility.
However, the multi-energy system has diverse administrative features and their
coordination within a single-energy system is quite complex. Therefore, to assist
their functioning, appropriate modeling methodologies and control procedures
should be developed.
To frame proper management of a multi-energy system, it is classified into four
groups, namely spatial, fuel, service, and network.
The spatial orientation of multi-energy management shown in Figure 12.4
highlights the various degrees of aggregation in terms of physical or by compo-
nents that connect the sectors to the district, and even countries. In service-
based multi-energy management shown in Figure 12.5 points out the provision
of different services such as electricity, water supply, gas filling stations, trans-
portation, heating, and cooling services. Fuel-based multi-energy management
shown in Figure 12.6 focuses on the integration of various fuels including both
renewable and non-renewable sources to provide optimal energy services in
view of both economically and environmentally. The network-based multi-
energy management shown in Figure 12.7 describes the multiple energy net-
works like electricity, gas, and transportation networks from one area to
another area in view of the sustainability of multi-energy management and
its development.

Result Discussion, Current Challenges, and Future
Research Opportunities
12.7.1
Result Discussion
Considering the case study of smart technology in Singapore’s transport system, in
Singapore smart mobility, sustainable, safe, and smart are the key elements in the
smart mobility policy formulation [27]. Before the implementation of IITS,
adequate smart transport planning is necessary since it bridges the present and
upcoming generations for the growth of sustainable economic activity by reducing
ecological problems caused by the current transport system. In this case, the
Singapore government took four key areas, namely integration of land use and
transport planning, transport supply measures, transport demand management,
and incorporation of environment-friendly technologies for vehicles. Based on
the identified area they formulate policies and strategies to implement IITS.
On the basics of the function performed, the Smart transport system in
Singapore’s broadly classified into four parts: control systems, monitoring and
enforcement systems, information management systems, and revenue management
systems [15].
12.7.1.1
Control System
Singapore’s smart transport system uses smart traffic control systems such as auto-
matic signals, namely the Green Link Determination System (GLIDE), B signal,
countdown signal, and intelligent road studs [22]. The GLIDE adaptive traffic sig-
nal system automatically adjusts signal timing based on the amount of traffic in
each direction while also allowing signal coordination along a corridor by simul-
taneously gathering traffic data by recognizing cars and pedestrians. Furthermore,
the transit signal priority scheme was also installed, which is nothing but a
B-signal that detects approaching buses and facilitates their movements by extend-
ing green time as well as turning on the B-signal to allow an earlier start [28].
12.7.1.2
Monitoring and Enforcement System
Technological improvements allow the transport system to monitor transport
facilities, spot interruptions in traffic flow, and detect traffic offenses continuously.
IITS operates 24 hours throughout the year and keeps monitoring traffic flow
based on the information gathered. To maintain smooth and safe operation, a
smart incident management system called Expressway Monitoring and Advisory
System (EMAS) was installed [27].
More than 320 major advanced surveillance cameras called J-eyes were installed
in Singapore to help spot irregular traffic flow including congestion, illegal park-
ing, and loading/unloading. These cameras automatically detect speeding and
338
12 Multi-Energy Management Schemes for the Sustainability

red light-running vehicles and take snapshots of the registration plates for
identification.
12.7.1.3
Information Management System
Information management system collects, processes, and shares real-time traffic
flow with drivers using fixed display platform or mobile platforms, based on the
information drivers can modify their paths in advance [27].
12.7.1.4
Revenue Management System
Managing fast and accurate transactions of public transport fares and automobile
toll payments is important for a transport system to be efficient [27]. Singapore is
utilizing various smart technologies for better management of revenue systems to
collect public transport fares, parking charges, and tolls [22].
The EEZ-link card allows users to pay for fares in local transportation modes like
buses. It is nothing but contactless tap-and-go fare cards paying fares [22]. The
Symphony Fore Payment, a penny improvement to that smart card, now makes
it easier to pay for other usages, namely parking fees.
12.7.2
Challenges in the Implementation of IITS
The following list includes both technical and non-technical challenges
1) AI – Enhancing automatic management and control of the system and lower-
ing costs [29].
2) IoT – With more modern networks, it can handle more data at a faster rate. We
can use intelligent IoT designs and analytics software in the transportation sec-
tor to address issues with security, revenue collecting, traffic control, and user
satisfaction.
3) Energy – Experiments are still being conducted on the idea of using alternative
energy sources instead of fossil fuels.
4) Big data – Gathered information, IoT, and AI are identified as the major tech-
nical challenges to perform.
The main technical challenge for implementing IITS is the bridging of various
homogeneous components such as IoT devices, applications, peoples, and pro-
cesses in different sectors [30]. Moreover, lots of attention was needed in proposing
web services, security concerns, and maintenance of the system beyond the uni-
form management and control of the system. Many of the complicated system
tools currently available on the market such as IoT, Cloud storage, and network
assets are created and integrated for each unique case, leading to rigid designs that
cannot be modified to accommodate updating systems and remain unclear
topologies.
12.7 Result Discussion, Current Challenges, and Future Research Opportunities
339

Also, the non-technical challenge, a new guiding environment that is compat-
ible with autonomous vehicles, network safety, and security should exist. Further-
more, communities must realize the new challenges to their routine and accept the
impacts on skills and employment [30].
12.7.3
Future Research Opportunities
• Market trends – Since the sensor is getting cheaper every day, suppliers are
making the most of them, which will increase the reliability of the control
system.
• New infrastructure – The advent of ancillary services like bike sharing has been
overshadowed by the current revolution in transportation such as the metro.
Transportation freedom in the area continues to be a problem. The ability to
travel between locations, towns, and sectors in handy ponds is still a desire
shared by residents of both urban areas and rural areas [31].
• Behavioral change – Competitors in the market may develop a system that
increases customer satisfaction by offering a quicker and more flexible service
at automobile facilities. The most recent advancement in big data analytics
has added new entrants in understanding the shift in client behavior and
requests for more flexible trip planning on demand and better vehicle monitor-
ing services.
• Allowing customers to select the seating and standing capacity on public tran-
sit will increase the standardization of transportation as the demand for cus-
tomized mobility grows daily [30]. The specialized service that places a strong
emphasis on client satisfaction will assist in getting past the privacy barrier.
Additionally, customers will place more trust in users as a result of tailored
services, and agents will have the opportunity to provide the client with supe-
rior service [31].
• 5G network – It starts an unrestricted, extensive wireless network. The 5G net-
work has strong support for the World Wide Web. The introduction of the 5G
network in Dubai, which has already been announced by the Telecommunica-
tions Regulatory Authority (TRA), would transform Internet consumption in
the United Arab Emirates [32].
• Industrial revolution–The industrial revolution had a significant impact on IITS.
First, Mobility as a Service has focused on providing a customer-centric trans-
portation system. Then, big data has also come a long way, and BDA currently
has significant influence on prediction and decision-making. As a result, it is
anticipated that smart roads would maximize benefits and improve the driving
experience. The networked communication of automobiles, especially with
emergency services, has recently been the trend revolution [14].

12.8
Conclusion
More thorough and organized research is required for IITS policy-making. With a
host of key policy recommendations, autonomous vehicles will change the trans-
portation industry. To determine the extent to which IITS can reduce bottlenecks
and contamination and, as a result, improve the sustainability of the environment,
more research is needed. A similar in-depth study is also needed to improve safer
and more effective rail systems to improve expedition effectiveness and cross-
border enablement. To facilitate easy trade in goods and the growth of tourism
in the province, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) secretariat may also do more research on mixed-mode commuting
and integrated transportation networks. Domestic rivers, navigation, air-traffic
management, and maritime transportation should all be the subjects of compara-
ble research.

Introduction
Electric vehicles (EVs) differ from internal combustion engines (ICEs) in that they
use electric motors for propulsion, while combustion engines generate power
through burning fuel and gases. As a promising alternative to conventional cars,
EVs have gained attention due to concerns such as pollution, global warming, and
the depletion of natural resources. Although the concept of EVs has been around
for some time, it has recently gained traction in response to the environmental
impact of fuel-powered vehicles. EVs are equipped with an onboard energy storage
system and can travel up to 400 km before requiring a recharge. Additionally, they
produce zero exhaust emissions [1]. The recharge time for EV batteries typically
ranges from four to eight hours, depending on their design. However, a super-
charger can reduce the time needed to charge half the battery to just 20 minutes.
Electric motors have higher efficiency compared to ICEs, which can be further
improved by implementing advanced technologies such as active suspension
and regenerative braking [2]. Despite the fact that EVs have been around longer
than combustion engine cars and are, in many ways, superior to them, their high
cost has hindered their widespread adoption. Battery costs, which make up around
35% of the total price of an electric car, have decreased by 85% over the last decade.
Currently, EVs are still more expensive than ICE cars, but their Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO) is frequently lower and is expected to reach parity in the near
future [3].

Many potential EV buyers are concerned about range, as they believe that EVs
either offer too little or too much driving range compared to their actual driving
patterns. For example, an average urban driver in the United States travels only 20
miles per day by car, which increases to 30 miles per day for driving-intensive
groups [4]. Based on the current battery efficiency, an ideal energy level for urban
drivers is around 25 kWh, which would allow them to travel about 100 miles on a
single charge. However, for occasional suburban or rural trips, a battery capacity of
around 40 kWh, or about 160 miles, would be optimal. This range would be suffi-
cient for the majority of users, particularly those in urban areas, without disrupting
their daily routine. By reducing battery capacity from 50 to 40 kWh, buyers could
save $1900–$2100 today [5]. Over the next five to seven years, automakers should
seriously consider collaborating with their competitors as the industry transitions
to electrification and struggles with profitability challenges. By working together,
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) can reduce the fixed costs of research
and development, tooling, and factories, particularly during the process of retool-
ing models and platforms for electrification [6]. Sharing EV platforms and factories
would enable a variety of model variants and substantial benefits could be realized.
Additionally, purchasing the same battery cells and power electronics in larger
volumes would provide scale benefits that are difficult to achieve alone. Many
automakers have already announced international agreements aimed at lowering
the cost of developing and manufacturing EVs [7].
According to a study by McKinsey and other industry experts, EVs have the
potential to achieve cost parity with ICE vehicles by around 2025, and may even
become more profitable than ICE vehicles [8]. This is due to advancements in bat-
tery cost and efficiency, scale economies in power electronics, and indirect cost
reduction based on higher manufacturing volumes. Researchers have conducted
financial and economic analyses of EVs, including their environmental impact
through CO2 emission reductions [9]. The financial sustainability of EVs and their
environmental benefits vary by area and the time-of-use rate programs used by
various electric companies. Financial incentives, charging infrastructure, and local
production facilities are important factors for promoting EV adoption, as evi-
denced by socioeconomic analyses. Blockchain-based financial and economic ana-
lyses are also emerging as distinct fields of study that leverage the same underlying
technology [10]. Blockchain-based financial analysis involves the analysis of
financial data stored on a blockchain. This can include analyzing transactions,
identifying patterns, and forecasting trends. The focus is on the financial data
of a particular entity or group of entities, such as a company or market segment.
On the other hand, blockchain-based economic analysis involves the study of eco-
nomic activity on a blockchain. This includes analyzing economic transactions,
identifying patterns, and forecasting trends. The focus is on the broader economic
activity of a blockchain network, including the behavior of participants, the

performance of decentralized applications, and the impact on the wider economy.
In summary, blockchain-based financial analysis is concerned with analyzing
financial data within a specific entity or group of entities, while blockchain-based
economic analysis is focused on analyzing the broader economic activity of a
blockchain network.
The main objective of this chapter is to provide financial and economic
analysis of the EVs. The chapter starts with the introduction in Section 13.1.
Section 13.2 describes the country-wise financial analysis of the EVs. Some
financial parameters, which are also the part of EVs, are presented in
Section 13.3. Section 13.4 describes the data assessment of different parameters
of the EVs by the NCSS Tool. Section 13.5 shows the blockchain-based financial
analysis of the EVs.
13.2
Country-Wise Financial Analysis of EVs
Manufacturers of EVs and batteries have been handsomely rewarded by financial
markets over the past two years. Until 2020, the financial performance of EV equi-
ties at the portfolio level was similar to that of other automakers and in line with
market performance. The combined market capitalization of the 10 largest car
manufacturers accounted for approximately 13% of the total market capitalization
of the 14 chosen EV shares. All indicators were negatively impacted by the COVID-
19 pandemic, but the extent of recovery varied. In the first half of 2020, both the EV
and battery indexes showed strong growth, with increases of 70% and 40%, respec-
tively. Currently, major auto markets are announcing green recovery plans and
committing to net zero emissions, further solidifying EVs as the future of transpor-
tation in regions like Europe, Japan, and Korea, among others [11]. Table 13.1
shows the major automaker announcements on electrification for the years
2021–2022.
By the end of 2021, the collective market value of the leading 10 automobile
manufacturers had decreased by 60% compared to that of EV producers, largely
due to Tesla, which accounted for 80% of the market value of the 14 pure-play
EV companies. Throughout 2021, EVs and battery indices remained higher than
those for automakers and the overall market. The decline in returns observed in
the EV index can be attributed to the increased competitiveness of traditional
automakers in the market for passenger EVs. As a result, it has become more
challenging to differentiate between the top 10 automakers and pure-play EV pro-
ducers since many of the top 10 automakers have expanded their EV businesses.
This trend may have caused environmentally and socially conscious investors to
redirect their investments from pure-play EV companies towards a broader
portfolio of automakers. To capitalize on the significant market value experienced
346
13 Blockchain-Based Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicles

by pure-play EV manufacturers, OEMs are contemplating the launch of separate
initial public offerings for their EV-related activities. According to financial mar-
kets, the future is electric [12]. When compared to the number of vehicles manu-
factured, pure-play EV companies have significantly higher market valuations
than traditional OEMs. However, despite these high valuations, many EV produ-
cers have failed to meet profitability expectations, with a majority reporting either
marginal or negative returns on total assets [13]. Figure 13.1 shows the list of
nations where plug-in EV sales made up the largest portion of new passenger cars
sold in 2020.
Following are the financial subsidies provided by different nations:
Norway: The Norwegian parliament has made a decision to mandate that all
newly sold cars in Norway must be electric or hydrogen-powered by 2026.

Consequently, by the conclusion of 2025, the number of EVs on the road is pro-
jected to exceed 470,000, with 64% of all new cars sold in Norway being battery
electric. The government has also resolved to retain current incentives for EVs
until the end of 2021, with updates and modifications being made to the incen-
tives in response to market changes [14].
The Norwegian EV incentives:
• No import/purchase taxes apply to EVs (1990).
• A 25% VAT exemption for purchases (2001).
• No yearly road tax (1996–2021).
• There are no fees on toll roads (1997–2017).
• Ferries are free to ride (2009–2017).
• The maximum ferry fee for EVs is 50% of the whole cost (2018).
• On toll highways, no more than 50% of the total is allowed (2018).
• Free public parking (1999–2017).
• A 25% VAT exemption for leasing (2015).
• The Norwegian Parliament set the national objective that by 2025, all new
vehicles sold must be zero-emission.
• For residents of
apartment
complexes, “charging
right”
was
estab-
lished (2017).
• Publicly purchased vehicles must be ZEVs starting in 2022. From 2025, city
buses must follow the same rules.
Iceland: Decades ago, Iceland laid the foundation for low-carbon transportation,
and it has now emerged as one of the world’s leading markets for EVs. The
country’s abundance of renewable energy, affordable electricity rates, high
fossil fuel costs, and urbanization make it an ideal market for EVs. In 2017,
EVs accounted for 8.7% of new car registrations in Iceland, second only to Nor-
way in Europe. Of these registrations, 2.0% were battery EVs (BEVs) and 6.8%
were plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs). By the end of 2018, the EV share had
increased to 13.5%. This is in contrast to the European Union, where the aver-
age EV percentage was only 1.4% in 2017. Iceland exempts all EVs from VAT
up to IKr 7,000,000, with the standard rate applying to vehicles above that
threshold. Additionally, shorter than 5 m electric and hydrogen-powered vehi-
cles are eligible for up to 90 minutes of free parking in the city center. Hybrid
vehicles weighing less than 1600 kg and with CO2 emissions of less than 50 g/
km can also avail of this benefit. The Icelandic government aims to transition
to electricity from fossil fuels in the coming decades and has proposed a ban on
new gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2030. By 2026, Iceland targets having
30,000 EVs on its roads [15].
Sweden: Sweden has been at the forefront of the shift to EVs, offering a plethora
of attractive incentives to EV owners. With a remarkable 26% market share
and an impressive 253% surge in sales in 2020, Sweden is driving the electric
348
13 Blockchain-Based Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicles

revolution forward. The increasing popularity of EVs can be attributed to a
range of incentives, such as federal grants, state and local tax incentives,
and local perks [16].
• Bonus Malus scheme: A grant of 60,000 SEK (€6000) is available for up to
26% of the cost of the car’s initial purchase for low-emission vehicles serviced
before 2021 with CO2 emissions of up to 59.9 g/km and vehicles serviced dur-
ing 2021 or after with CO2 emissions of up to 69.9 g/km. The grant is open to
both private citizens and companies.
• Grants for EV buses: Municipalities, limited corporations, or public trans-
portation authorities may be eligible for a grant worth 20% of the cost of an EV
bus. The reward for private transportation businesses is equal to 40% of the
price difference between an equivalent diesel bus and an electric bus.
• High occupancy vehicle (HOV) and bus lanes are sometimes available
for free.
Netherlands: The infrastructure ministry has confirmed that the government has
utilized its €71 million budget for this year’s program, which aims to incentivize
the purchase of new EVs among the general population. A total of 22,000 indi-
viduals were granted €3350 each to assist in the purchase of a more affordable
electric car. To qualify, the vehicle must have a maximum price of €45,000 and a
minimum range of 120 km. In addition, subsidies of €2000 are available for used
EVs, and the €20.4 million fund that supports them remains fully available. In
the Netherlands, customers who purchase a new BEVs with a list price between
€13,000 and €46,000 and a minimum range of 125 km are eligible for a €5000
subsidy in 2021 and 2022. The subsidy is only available when purchasing or leas-
ing through an authorized dealer. If the leasing agreement is broken before the
four-year mark, the subsidies will be discontinued, and if consumers purchase
another vehicle within three years, they will be required to repay some of the
subsidies. BPM must be paid when purchasing an electric car or motorcycle.
The BPM rate is calculated using the World Harmonized Light Vehicle Testing
Procedure CO2 testing method, and additional information on how the rate is
determined can be found here [17]. The following BPM tax incentives are avail-
able to EV owners:
• Until 2024, all purchases of pure EVs are tax-free. Owners will pay a levy of
€360 per vehicle in 2025. The tax levy will rise yearly beginning in 2025.
• Consumers must annually pay the MRB (Motor Vehicle Tax) in order to own
a motorcycle, car, or truck.
Additionally, owners of EVs benefit from the following reductions in motor
vehicle taxes:
• Up to 2024, completely EVs are exempt from MRB. Owners will receive a
74% tax break on MRB in 2026. The full tax charge will be applied starting
in 2025.
13.2 Country-Wise Financial Analysis of EVs
349

• Up to 2024, PHEVs must receive a 50% reduction on MRB. The MRB discount
rate will be lowered by the Dutch government to 25% in 2025. The MRB fee
will be fully applied starting in 2026.
• Bijtelling is a type of tax that drivers must pay if they use a work vehicle for
personal purposes. Your taxable income base is increased by a portion of your
vehicle’s list price based on its emissions.
Finland: Currently, the Finnish government is providing a purchase subsidy of
€2000 ($2260) for consumers who buy new electric cars or enter into long-term
leasing agreements for EVs, up to a maximum of €50,000 or $56,000. If a private
individual buys a new EV, they may be eligible for a subsidy of up to €2000, pro-
vided that the vehicle’s list price does not exceed €50,000. Additionally, the
Finnish government frequently introduces scrappage programs, which offer pri-
vate individuals bonuses of up to €2000 for trading in old diesel or gasoline vehi-
cles when purchasing a new EV [18].
• Currently, a fully electric car that costs no more than €50000 can receive an
assistance payment of €2000. Private individuals may apply for the subsidy.
• Depending on the size of the vehicle, funding in the amount of €3000, €5000,
or €7000 may be provided. Private individuals and businesses can both apply
for the subsidy.
• Depending on the size of the vehicle, financial assistance ranging from €7000
to €51,000 may be given for the purchase of an electric truck. Private indivi-
duals and businesses can both apply for the subsidy.
Denmark: Denmark is trailing behind its neighboring countries like Sweden
and Norway in terms of its EVs and EV charging infrastructure. In 2015,
the Danish government started phasing out subsidies for EVs, resulting in a
decline in their sales in the country. As a matter of fact, in 2017, EVs only
accounted for 0.4% of all cars sold in Denmark. However, Denmark’s outlook
is positive as they have implemented a new climate law and removed tax
increases on EVs in 2019. Currently, their market share for EVs stands at
approximately 4% [19].
Tax benefits: As a result of the removal of registration tax incentives for EVs in
Denmark, sales of EVs in the country decreased, but only for vehicles valued
below DKK 400,000 (approximately €54,000). The tax exemption for these vehi-
cles will gradually decrease from 20% in 2020 to 65% in 2021, 90% in 2022, and
100% in 2023. Additionally, in April 2018, the Danish government introduced a
registration tax deduction based on the battery capacity of the EV. Circulation
taxes in Denmark are based on the weight and fuel use of the vehicle, and both
plug-in hybrids and BEVs pay lower taxes than comparable diesel or gasoline
vehicles [20].
Switzerland: While the Swiss Federal Government does not provide official sub-
sidies for EVs, it is worth noting that some regions in the country do offer them.
350
13 Blockchain-Based Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicles

In the Thurgau region, the government provides a subsidy of CHF3932.73 for
the purchase of an EV. Similarly, in St. Gallen, a contribution of CHF4915.91
is provided for EV purchases [21].
Portugal: The Environmental Fund of the Portuguese Government has provided
€4,000,000 in financing towards EV ownership incentives in 2021:
• Private individuals:
– €4000 for the acquisition of a brand-new BEV, one vehicle per person only.
– €6000 for the acquisition of a brand-new, completely electric van; one car
per individual only.
– One electric freight bicycle may be purchased per person for 55% of the
buying value price (up to a maximum of €1000).
– A maximum of one completely electric motorcycle, moped, or bicycle may
be purchased for 50% of the purchase price.
• Companies:
– A maximum of two electric vans or light goods vehicles may be purchased
for €6000 each.
– Up to four electric freight bicycles may be purchased per candidate for 50%
of the buying value price.
– Up to four completely electric motorcycles, mopeds, or bicycles may be
purchased at 50% of the purchase price (up to a maximum of €350) per
candidate.
• VAT benefits
– Both hybrid plug-in vehicles and fully EVs with list prices under €51,000
and €61,400, respectively, are eligible for a full VAT deduction.
– BEV company vehicles are exempt from corporate income tax.
Germany: Germany is highly dedicated to achieving its target of having 11 million
EVs and 1.5 million charging stations by 2032, and as a result, it offers some of
the most generous EV subsidies in Europe. Thanks to the significant financing
for EV incentives included in the €135 billion post-COVID-19 stimulus plan
this summer, an electric Seat Mii can now be purchased for less than
€12,000. Germany’s “Umweltbonus” program encourages the purchase of
EVs and the retirement of diesel and gasoline vehicles, providing additional
incentives for customers [22].
• Until 2032, a one-time subsidy of up to 55% of the purchase costs of fully elec-
tric cars used for commercial deliveries is available.
• This bonus is available provided the acquired EV has an Acoustic Vehicle
Alert System (AVAS), which costs an extra €100.
Tax benefits:
Kfz-Steuer (motor vehicle tax):
• Fully EVs registered between 2012 and 2032 are exempt from this tax for a
period of 12 years. This means that EV owners in Germany can save, on
13.2 Country-Wise Financial Analysis of EVs

average, about €194 in ownership tax for each car and year, though this
amount may be significantly greater depending on the type of vehicle. If
you decide to drive an ICE vehicle, you can use this calculator to determine
how much car tax you would pay [23].
• Due to their lower CO2 emissions, PHEVs are taxed, although at a lower rate
than diesel or gasoline vehicles.
Company car tax:
• A completely electric car with a list price under €59,000 is only taxed at 0.25%
of the list price per month for private use. ICE vehicles are taxed at 1%, in
contrast.
• A hybrid or completely electric company automobile with a list price over
€59,000 is only taxed on private consumption at 0.5% of the list price per
month. ICE cars are taxed at 1.2%, in contrast.
VAT:• Will briefly decrease from 20% to 16.5% between 1 July and 31 December
2020. Both BEVs and PHEVs benefit from this tax relief.
Local incentives for BEVs:
• Depending on where you live, towns and municipalities may provide you up
to €1475 in additional purchase grants (you check this here).
• Local energy providers frequently provide additional EV incentives to both
new and existing customers.
Luxembourg: Luxembourg, which holds a 3% market share in 2020, maintains its
position in the list of the top 15 EV markets in Europe. However, the country’s
EV market is still in the early stages of growth and falls towards the lower end of
the spectrum, in contrast to Norway where the market share is much higher
at 48%.
France: France is widely recognized for its dedication to promoting the use of EVs.
President Emmanuel Macron has recently made a series of announcements to
support this initiative, such as a $9 billion rescue package for the domestic auto-
mobile industry and the establishment of targets for the upcoming year. These
targets comprise installing 100,000 or more public charging stations, manufac-
turing at least 1 million EVs annually by 2027, and encouraging greater adop-
tion of EVs. To help achieve these objectives, the government has allocated €1.3
billion in incentives, which enable citizens to save up to €21,000 when purchas-
ing an EV. [24]
Subsidies:
• Purchase grant:
– Bonus of up to €8000 for cars generating no more than 20 g CO2/km.
– Up to €2000 in bonuses are available for plug-in hybrid vehicles with CO2
emissions of between 21 and 50 g/km.
352
13 Blockchain-Based Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicles

• Scrappage program (conversion bonus): Up to €6000 is available for the pur-
chase of pre-owned or new BEVs and PHEVs if you trade in your diesel or
gasoline vehicle that is older than 2001.
• Low emission zone bonus: If you reside or work in a low emission zone, you
are eligible for a €1100 subsidy towards the purchase of an EV.
Tax benefits:
• License plate registration fee: Depending on the location, both fully EVs and
plug-in hybrids either are eligible for a 55% reduction or are completely
exempt from paying the license plate registration fee (carte grise) in Metropol-
itan France.
• Fully EVs are exempt from the company car tax.
Local incentives:
• In some locations, up to €7000 in additional purchasing allowances are avail-
able; for a complete list of regional incentives, see our comprehensive guide to
France’s EV incentives.
• Green card holders in some towns are entitled to up to two hours of free park-
ing (eligible for EVs).
• The 3264 parking spaces formerly reserved for the Autolib program, a public
EV car-sharing program that was offered in Paris, Lyon, and Bordeaux
between 2012 and 2019 but is now inactive will be made available for free
parking for Paris EV drivers, according to the mayor of Paris.
13.3
Key Financial Ratio for Financial Analysis of EVs
Financial ratio analysis is a technique used to evaluate the correlation (or ratio)
between two or more financial data points obtained from a company’s financial
statements. Its primary objective is to facilitate accurate comparisons over time
and among different businesses or sectors. The subsequent financial ratios are sig-
nificant metrics that analysts and investors consider while assessing the automo-
bile industry. The important financial ratios that analysts and investors take into
account while evaluating the auto industry are as follows:
• Debt to equity (D/E) ratio: EV firms require significant capital investment,
making the D/E ratio a crucial metric for assessing their financial health and
ability to meet financial obligations. An increasing D/E ratio indicates greater
reliance on debt financing rather than equity financing. Consequently, investors
and lenders prefer a lower D/E ratio. The D/E ratio of a company with an equal
proportion of assets and liabilities is 1. Comparing the D/E ratios of companies
within the same industry is essential since debt requirements vary across
industries.
13.3 Key Financial Ratio for Financial Analysis of EVs
353

• Inventory turnover ratio: The inventory turnover ratio is a significant evalu-
ation metric in the automotive industry, particularly for dealerships that special-
ize in EVs. When dealerships hold onto inventory for more than 60 days, it is
considered a risk to EV sales. The inventory turnover ratio measures how often
a company’s inventory is sold or “turned over” during a year and is a useful indi-
cator of a company’s inventory and order management. For dealerships selling
EVs, the inventory turnover ratio is especially important since it indicates the
speed at which they are selling their current stock of EVs on the lot.
• Return on equity (ROE) ratio: The ROE is a critical financial metric that is
useful in assessing the performance of most firms. It is an especially vital statistic
for evaluating companies in the electric car industry. The ROE gauges how prof-
itable a company is for its investors by measuring the net profit in relation to
shareholder equity. Ideally, analysts and investors prefer higher returns on
equity. In the first quarter of 2022, the average ROE for the sector was
15.86%, underscoring its significance to investors.
• EBITDA margin (%): EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a profitability measure that adheres
to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, it is frequently
utilized in financial analysis because it offers a more accurate assessment of a
company’s continuous production returns, which includes many nonopera-
tional items, as opposed to just using earnings. The EBITDA margin calculates
the operational profit as a percentage of revenue. By comparing a company’s
EBITDA margin to others in the same industry, it becomes possible to evaluate
the company’s actual performance.
In the EV sector, for instance, if XYZ Company makes $100 million in reve-
nue, $40 million goes for the battery, motor, and auxiliary components of the
EVs, and another $20 million goes on overhead. Operating profit is $30 million
after depreciation and amortization costs of $10 million. $5 million is spent on
interest, leaving $25 million in revenues before taxes. Table 13.2 shows the data
set related to the EBITDA of EV company.
• EBIT margin (%): The EBIT margin is a financial metric that assesses a com-
pany’s profitability by excluding taxes and interest. It is calculated by dividing

sales or net income by EBIT, which stands for profits before interest and taxes.
The EBIT margin, also known as the operating margin, provides insight into the
economic activities of an individual EV company and measures the benefit
derived from these activities. It does not consider how the company is financed
or any government or national policy interventions.
EBIT = sales – variable cost – fixed cost
• To determine the EBIT, it is crucial to identify the sales of EVs. While EV sales
have been increasing globally, the growth pattern varies across regions. Europe
experienced only a 10% increase in EV sales in the first half of 2022, compared
to the previous two years of fast sales growth, due to low overall auto sales,
continued component shortages, and the Ukraine War. In contrast, the United
States, Canada, and China saw significant year-over-year increases in EV sales,
despite external factors such as a slowdown in the broader light vehicle indus-
try, the real estate crisis, and COVID lockdowns. BYD emerged as the global
sales leader by more than doubling their sales to 651,050 units, including
PHEV sales, while Tesla continued to dominate the market in terms of BEVs
with 566,020 units shipped in H1. Although sales volumes of PEVs are still
increasing, the mix of PHEVs is becoming less dominant due to lower incen-
tives and improved BEV options. The growth of EV sales is increasingly influ-
enced by the degree of electrification, and FCEV sales have fallen by 9%
annually with only five car models generating the majority of their sales in
the United States and South Korea.
• PBT margin (%): “Profit before tax” measures how much money a corporation
makes before having to pay corporate income tax. In essence, it is the entire
amount of a company’s profits before any taxes. Profit before taxes is shown
on the income statement as operating profit minus interest. Profit before tax
is the number used to calculate a company’s tax obligation.
• Net profit margin (%): The net profit margin, sometimes known as just net
margin, is the amount of net income or profit expressed as a percentage of rev-
enue. It is the ratio of net profits to revenues for a company or business segment.
In addition to being expressed as a percentage, net profit margin can also be
expressed as a decimal. A company’s net profit margin reveals how much of
its income is turned into profit. Table 13.3 shows the assessment of the net profit
margin of the EV industry.
• Current ratio (X): The current rate, a liquidity rate, evaluates a business’ capa-
bility to pay short-term loans or those that are due within a time. It shows to
investors and judges how an EV company can make the most use of its current
means to pay down its other payables and current arrears.
• Quick ratio (X): An EV company’s capability to meet its short-term scores
using its most liquid means is estimated using the quick rate, which also acts
13.3 Key Financial Ratio for Financial Analysis of EVs
355

as a measure of the EV company’s short-term liquidity position. Because it
demonstrates how soon the EV company can use its near-cash means to pay
off its present arrears, it is occasionally appertained to as the“ acid test rate.”
• Inventory turnover ratio (X): Inventory turnover is a fiscal statistic that
shows how constantly a business rotates its force in comparison to its cost of
goods sold (COGS) over a given time frame. The average number of days it takes
for an EV company to vend its force can also be calculated by dividing the num-
ber of days in the period, which is generally a financial time, by the force devel-
opment rate. Using the force development rate, businesses can make better
choices regarding pricing, product, marketing, and purchasing. One effective-
ness rate used to assess how effectively a company uses its coffers is this one.
• Dividend payout ratio (NP) (%): The dividend payout rate is the proportion of
the EV company’s net income to the total quantum of tips paid to shareholders.
It is the portion of earnings that is paid out to shareholders as tips. The plutocrat
that is not given to shareholders is retained by the pot, which uses it to reduce

debt or reinvest in its core businesses. It is also known as the payout rate in
some cases.
• Earning retention ratio (%): The retention rate is the proportion of earnings
that the EV company keeps. The retention rate is the percentage of net gains
used to grow the business rather than being dispersed as dividends. It is contrary
of the payout rate, which determines the chance of gains delivered as tips to
shareholders. The plowback rate is another name for the retention rate.

Cost Assessment of EVs with Different Parameters
Data assessment is the process of evaluating data and reaching significant conclu-
sions through various logical methods. By employing data analysis, experimenters
can organize, manipulate, and summarize data to address important questions.
One aspect of data assessment involves considering various parameters, such as
acceleration, top speed, range, efficiency, and fast-charging capabilities, to deter-
mine the prices (in Euros) of EVs manufactured by different companies. Table 13.4
shows the different parameters of the different types of EVs. Among all the vehi-
cles, Lucid has a minimum acceleration of 2.8 seconds. By the regression analysis,
Eq. (13.1) shows the relationship between, Price (Euro) as a dependent parameter
and various independent parameters, such as acceleration, speed, range, effi-
ciency, and charging capability. Figures 13.2 and 13.3 show the forecasting of
the price (Euro) and charging capability of the EVs.

Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicle
Infrastructure by Blockchain
A blockchain refers to a distributed database or ledger that is shared among com-
puter networks. It functions as a digital database for storing data and is most com-
monly recognized for its use in maintaining secure and decentralized records of
cryptocurrency transactions like Bitcoin. Unlike traditional systems that rely on
a trusted third party, blockchain technology promotes confidence by ensuring
the integrity and security of data records. The arrangement of data in a blockchain
is unique, as it is collected in units called blocks, each containing sets of data. Once
a block is filled, it is sealed and linked to the previous block to create the block-
chain. Blocks have predefined storage capacities, and when a chain is complete,
any additional data is combined to create a new block that is added to the chain.
This data structure intentionally produces an irreversible record of data when used
in a decentralized system. While a database typically organizes its data into tables,
blockchain divides its data into blocks that are chained together. As each block is
added to the chain, an accurate timestamp is assigned, creating a permanent and
immutable record. In a blockchain, the data is gathered in units called blocks, and
each block comprises sets of data. Each of the individual blocks that make up the
data trail known as the block chain has a specific amount of storage space. A block
is sealed when it is full and joined to the block before it. Each piece of data that
comes after the just-added block is used to generate a new block, which is then
added to the chain after the chain is complete. Figure 13.4 shows the block-
chain-based green vehicle transaction infrastructure. Blockchains, as their name
suggests, organize their information into units (blocks) that are linked together, in
contrast to databases, which typically organize their data into tables. When used
decentralized, this data structure purposefully results in an immutable chronology
of data. A finished block is sealed forever and added to the timeline. Each block
that is submitted to the chain receives a precise timestamp. Digital information can
be transmitted and preserved without being modified with the use of a blockchain.
Alternatively referred to as distributed ledger technology, unchangeable ledgers or
records of interactions that cannot be changed, deleted, or destroyed are con-
structed on top of a blockchain (DLT).
For EV industry to create a distributed application on “Ethereum” platform. In
blockchain-based EV transaction use “Solidity” an object-oriented language for

contract development between EV suppliers and EV consumers. “Remix” based
blockchain platform is used for developing and testing EV transaction between
supplier and consumer. This transaction changes according to the type of manu-
facturer company and according to the city and country.
To facilitate the transaction between supplier and consumer Ganache can be
used. In blockchain My Ether wallet is used to create a wallet for each EV con-
sumer. The EV supplier will publish the terms and conditions. Any other EV con-
sumer will look at the contract of EVs by using the interface provided by the terms
and conditions and send per unit cost to the supplier for executing a part of the
transaction [17]. Following are the ways of EV financial transactions through
the Ethereum-based blockchain concept.
Decide the name of contract for EV financial transaction:

We will declare two variables as follows:
uint pua;
# pua = per unit amount of EVs
uint voe;
# voe = value of EVs (depend on company and features)
The variable “pua” will hold the accumulated money sent by the EV consumer
to the supplier. The “voe” shows the value of EVs based on the different features.

In the EV transaction, set the values of two variables
Constructor (uint minperunit Amount, uint minvalue of EVs)
public
{
pua = 0;
voe = 10000($);
<closing flower bracket missing>
Initially, the amount collected through the EV transaction is zero, so set the
“pua” field as zero. Set the amount of electricity required for EVs to some arbitrary
number, in this case 10000($).
The supplier decides the value.
In the EV transaction, to examine the collected amount by the consumer at any
given point of time, a public contract method called getAmount defined as follows:
function getAmount () public view returns (uint)
{
return pua;
}
To get the balanced EV transaction value at any given point in time, we define
getBalance EV transaction method as follows:
function getBalance EVs transaction () public view
returns(uint) {
return value;
}
Finally, we write an EV transaction method (Send). It enables the EV consumer
to send some amount to the supplier for EV transaction:
function send (uint newDeposit) public {
value = value−newDeposit;
amount = amount + newDeposit;
}
The execution of the Send method will modify both “pua” and “voe” fields of
the RET.

R3 Corda in EV Transaction
The idea of R3 Corda is that by focusing on enterprise financial applications such
as EV transaction, the platform is simplified and eventually mitigates several risks,
such as scalability, privacy, and so on, which is also required for efficient EV
370
13 Blockchain-Based Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicles

transaction. R3 Corda Blockchain is an enterprise blockchain distributed ledger
that can be used in EV transaction. A blockchain is a tamper-evident, shared dig-
ital ledger that records transactions between EV consumers and EV suppliers
through the peer-to-peer network. Distributed to all the electricity consumers into
the nodes in the network, the ledger permanently records all the EV transactions
in a sequential chain of cryptographic hash-linked blocks, documenting the his-
tory of all the EV exchanges that take place between the peers in the network.
Framework of R3 Corda-based EV transaction is presented in Figure 13.5.
A Corda network for EV transaction is a fully connected graph, and all
nodes can potentially send an information to each EV consumer related to
the bidding of the EVs. Nodes are informed about the topology of EVs by a
network map service. The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is
used in the R3 Corda system to transmit information between customers
and suppliers through Transport Layer Security, enabling resilient queuing
and routing even in the event that electric car transaction nodes need to be

restarted. Message delivery and persistence guarantees are provided using
AMQP, which is asynchronous, performs well under load, and runs without
making any assumptions about ongoing communication between manufac-
turers and buyers of EVs. Messages queue up and retry until delivered, even
if the receivers are not online. With this design, a network in Corda, also
called as EV Transaction Zone, can process multiple transactions between sup-
pliers and consumers simultaneously, it meets the needs for strict privacy
requirements during the payment of per unit cost of EVs.
Corda is a Java virtual machine (JVM)-based application used for transaction of
EVs. As a result, many of Corda’s features depend on the JVM ecosystem, includ-
ing platform independence for electricity consumers, portability (the transmission
of bytecode), serialization (suspension), and many others. Therefore, a Corda node
is a portable JVM run-time process, and by using the “java” command, you may
simply operate numerous nodes on a single physical system. Using a configuration
known as a network map for transaction system, which is a collection of signed
node information that will be kept in a cache on each node, all nodes in an EV
transaction system may see each other. It is possible to use a network map server
or the file system to restore this cached configuration. The states are saved
(updated) internally in the vault relational database on the Corda node upon
the recording of a transaction on the ledger.
13.5.2
Blockchain Merkle Tree of EV Transaction
The Merkle tree is the key building component of blockchain technology. It is a
sort of mathematical data structure used to describe all the operations of EVs in
a block of information. It is made up of hashes of various data blocks between pro-
viders and buyers of EVs. Additionally, it enables speedy and secure information
verification across a huge volume of EV transaction data. Additionally, it aids in
confirming the accuracy and completeness of the data. The Merkle Trees structure
is used by both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Hash Tree is another name for Merkle Tree.
By creating a digital fingerprint of the collected edition of activities from the con-
sumer, a Merkle tree saves all of the interactions in a block. It enables an EV user to
decide whether or not a transaction can be included in a block. Merkle trees are
produced by repeatedly hashing node pairs until only one hash remains. The Mer-
kle Root, also known as the Root Hash, is this hash. Merkle Trees are built from the
ground up. The non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hashes, whereas each leaf
node is a hash of data information. Since Merkle trees are in a binary tree, we need
an even number of leaf nodes. The final hash will be duplicated once to produce an
even number of leaf nodes if the number of transactions is odd. The most common
and fundamental type of Merkle tree, the Binary Merkle Tree, is shown above.
372
13 Blockchain-Based Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicles

TX1, TX2, TX3, and TX4 are the four transactions that make up a block. As you can
see, the top hash, which is the hash of the entire tree, is the root hash, also referred
to as the Merkle root. By repeatedly hashing each of these and storing the results in
each leaf node, hash 0, 1, 2, and 3 are created. A parent node’s subsequent pairings
of leaf nodes are summed by hashing Hash0 and Hash1, which results in Hash01,
and then separately hashing Hash2 and Hash3, which results in Hash23. The two
hashes (Hash01 and Hash23) are hashed once again to get the Root Hash or Mer-
kle Root. The Merkle Root information can be found in block headers. The block
header is the area of a Bitcoin block that is hashed during mining. It contains the
Root Hash of the most recent block’s transactions in a Merkle Tree as well as the
Root Hash of the block before that, which is a Nonce. Therefore, by including the
Merkle root in the block header, the transaction is rendered impregnable. Because
the Root Hash contains the hashes of each transaction in the block, these transac-
tions might save space on the disc. The Merkle Tree preserves the consistency of
the data. If a single transactional detail or the order in which it happens changes,
the hash of the transaction will change. This modification would affect the value
of the Merkle Root, invalidating the block. The Merkle Tree would experience this
alteration cascading up to the Merkle Root. Everyone can therefore agree that the
Merkle tree allows for a quick and simple test to verify whether a specific trans-
action is a part of the set or not. Figure 13.6 shows the Merkle tree of different
financial parameters of the EVs.

Applicability of Different Blockchain
Cryptocurrencies in EV Transaction
Cryptocurrencies on the blockchain can potentially be used in EVs transactions, as
they can provide a secure, decentralized, and transparent method of payment.
Here are some different cryptocurrencies and their potential applicability in EV
transactions:
• Bitcoin: Bitcoin is the most popular and well-known cryptocurrency. Its popu-
larity and widespread acceptance make it a potential payment option for EV
transactions. However, due to its high transaction fees and slow processing time,
it may not be the most practical option for small transactions.
• Litecoin: Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that was created to be a faster and
cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. Its faster processing time and lower transaction
fees make it a more practical option for smaller EV transactions.
• Ripple: Ripple is a cryptocurrency that focuses on cross-border transactions. Its
fast processing time and low transaction fees make it a potential payment option
for international EV transactions.
• Bitcoin Cash: Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin that was created to improve its
transaction processing time and lower its fees. Its faster processing time and
lower fees could make it a more practical option for smaller EV transactions.
13.7
Challenges and Advantages of Using
Blockchain for EVs
Blockchain technology offers several potential advantages for the EV industry,
including improved security, increased transparency, and reduced fraud. How-
ever, there are also challenges associated with using blockchain for EVs.
• Advantages:
– Secure Transactions: Blockchain technology can provide an extra layer of
security to EV transactions by encrypting them and making them immutable.
This reduces the risk of fraud and hacking, ensuring that transactions are
transparent and trustworthy.
– Smart Contracts: Blockchain enables the use of smart contracts, which are
self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code.
This can automate EV transactions such as charging and billing, reducing
the need for intermediaries and improving efficiency.
– Decentralization: Blockchain is a decentralized technology, which means
that it operates on a peer-to-peer network without the need for a central
374
13 Blockchain-Based Financial and Economic Analysis of Green Vehicles

authority. This can reduce transaction costs and increase the efficiency of the
overall EV ecosystem.
– Traceability: Blockchain can provide a transparent and immutable record of
EV transactions, making it easier to track the history of a vehicle and ensuring
that the data is trustworthy.
• Challenges:
– Scalability: One of the biggest challenges of using blockchain for EVs is scal-
ability. The current infrastructure of blockchain may not be able to handle the
large volumes of transactions required for EVs, which can cause delays and
increase transaction costs.
– Interoperability: The EV industry is made up of multiple stakeholders,
including manufacturers, charging station operators, and utilities. Ensuring
that these stakeholders can interact with each other on a blockchain platform
requires interoperability, which can be a challenge.
– Regulatory Environment: Blockchain technology is still relatively new, and
regulations surrounding its use in the EV industry are still evolving. This can
create uncertainty and slow down the adoption of the technology.
– Integration: Integrating blockchain technology into existing EV infrastruc-
ture can be a challenge. There are often legacy systems in place that may not
be compatible with blockchain technology, which can make it difficult to
implement.
At the end, the advantages of blockchain for the EV industry are promising, but
the challenges must be addressed to ensure widespread adoption and the realiza-
tion of its full potential.

Conclusion
After researching the use of blockchain in the financial sector the blockchain, it
becomes evident that a distributed ledger of a closed kind is crucial to the future
of finance. Additionally, it is vital to jointly utilize global blockchain consortia,
blockchain consortiums of financial institutions, and regional consortiums of local
banking organizations. In the near future, it is necessary to identify the basic entity
of blockchain in the green vehicle infrastructure. In the future, it is also necessary
to identify the financial analysis and application of blockchain technology in the
EV charging station. The following are the outcome of this chapter:
• It is found out by the end of 2023 North America will be able to produce 1 million
BEVs, with 30 EV types.
• It is also found out Norway is the leading country in the field of EVs with a mar-
ket share of 74.8%.
13.8 Conclusion
375

• Denmark is trailing behind its neighboring countries like Sweden and Norway
in terms of its EVs and EV charging infrastructure. In Denmark, the tax exemp-
tion for these vehicles will gradually decrease from 20% in 2020 to 65% in 2021,
90% in 2022, and 100% in 2023.
• Blockchain technology can offer significant benefits to the EV industry, including
improvedtransparency,traceability,datasecurity,efficiency,anddecentralization.
• R3 Corda’s built-in regulatory and compliance features can help ensure that the
financial assessment process complies with relevant laws and regulations, such
as anti-money laundering and consumer protection laws. This can help reduce
the risk of legal and regulatory issues and improve the reputation of the EV
industry.

Introduction
14.1.1
Context and Motivation
In recent years, interconnected modern multi-energy networks have emerged as a
promising solution for achieving a green economy and sustainable development.
Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) play a critical role in this transition. A key
aspect of ITSs is the deployment of wireless rechargeable sensor networks
(WRSNs) to monitor, control, and optimize transportation systems. This chapter
contributes to the broader context of the book by presenting an innovative
approach for powering WRSNs through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) supported by locally deployed laser beam directors (LBDs) and renewable
energy (RE) sources. The UAV relies on a combination of its onboard battery as
well as laser beams and RE to procure sufficient and consistent power for charging
sensors in the WRSNs. An energy cost optimization model is proposed to minimize
the overall energy procurement costs for the UAV’s operation. By integrating these
emerging technologies into the interconnected multi-energy networks and lever-
aging the proposed optimization model, this approach aims to significantly
enhance the sustainability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of next-generation
ITSs. It not only advances the state of the art in WRSN charging schemes but also
demonstrates the potential of leveraging modern, multi-energy networks in the
development of next-generation ITSs, ultimately contributing to a greener econ-
omy and a more sustainable future.
14.1.2
Background
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have found widespread use in a variety of fields,
including environmental and structural monitoring, smart agriculture, military
missions, and intelligent transportation [1–5]. WSNs have the ability to greatly
increase the functioning of current transportation systems. For instance, if a
WSN is utilized to construct a vehicle ad hoc network (VANET) in an ITS, the data
acquired from this system can potentially be leveraged to enhance public safety
and provide a variety of useful services, including but not limited to transportation
and traffic management [6]. Vehicles employing VANET can communicate with
one another directly through their sensors, and a collision warning system can be
used to avert traffic accidents. Individual vehicle monitoring systems can be set up
for tracking criminal suspects remotely via connecting the vehicle sensors
with roadside sensors. This has the ability to end deadly, high-speed chases. More-
over, this new form of ITS has the potential to improve public safety while also
automating parking and traffic enforcement services. Another possible advantage
is lower traffic enforcement costs for police agencies. Currently, wired sensors are
380
14 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Toward Intelligent Transportation Systems

generally used to collect traffic data for traffic planning and control. Existing sen-
sing systems’ high equipment and maintenance costs, as well as time-consuming
installation, preclude the large-scale deployment of real-time traffic control and
monitoring. Tiny, wireless sensors with built-in sensing, processing, and wireless
communication functionalities provide enormous cost and installation benefits.
WRSNs will be critical in the creation of future smart cities, notably in the trans-
portation sector [5]. These systems employed RE or self-charging capabilities for
powering a wide range of distinctive traffic and environmental monitoring appli-
cations. The use of wireless charging (WC) with UAVs is an innovative approach
for supplying power for WRSNs [7, 8]. This strategy allows the ongoing
deployment of WRSNs to previously inaccessible sites while also decreasing the
maintenance requirements for constant WC networks. This solution, however,
is constrained by present technologies. Since UAVs have a short battery life, they
should return to their base stations on a regular basis to recharge. Moreover, bat-
tery capacity constraints in these devices restrict their capability to power sensor
networks across a vast region. To overcome the UAV’s short battery life, previous
research concentrated on different aspects of UAVs and proposed possible
solutions like employing high-quality devices such as batteries, manufacturing
materials, wings, geometry, and motors. A number of works have described opti-
mization algorithms that explore the shortest path for UAVs to their destination.
In the majority of cases, the conventional battery swapping approach is employed;
a UAV flies to a charging station on a regular basis, where the exhausted battery is
withdrawn and an entirely charged one is inserted. This physical battery replace-
ment approach, however, requires human help, hampering UAV operations and
generating severe service disruptions in distant places [9].
To address these challenges, UAVs should typically employ a hybrid energy sup-
ply architecture, which brings together various energy sources, enabling the use of
UAVs for a range of services without hampering UAV operations or causing serv-
ice disruptions while conserving time and human resources. Therefore, it is essen-
tial to choose an appropriate energy source hybridization architecture with an
optimal energy procurement system to ensure the efficient operation of modern
UAVs. Although all the studies looking into UAV-related problems concentrated
on the energy perspective of average or instantaneous power consumed/harvested
when flying, hovering, processing data, or communicating, none of them consid-
ered the UAV’s energy procurement costs, nor did they consider determining the
optimal amount of energies to be procured by the UAV from each energy source.
In this chapter, we first review the existing energy supply strategies for WSN-based
ITSs. Then, to accommodate for the limits of UAVs in the development of the
UAV-based WRSNs charging scheme, we propose a consistent and cost-aware
energy procurement framework for a UAV powered concurrently by laser beams
emitted by locally deployed LBDs and local RE sources. The UAV intends to
14.1 Introduction
381

decrease its overall energy cost for a given operation cycle by optimizing the quan-
tities of energy acquired from its internal battery and laser beams at each time
period. Indeed, the objective is to lower total energy costs by making accurate
procurement decisions. Furthermore, we estimate the amount of extra RE that
can be used to power the sensors in WRSNs using wireless power transfer
(WPT) technology.
14.2
WSN for ITSs: The Energy Supply Issue
and Existing Solutions
The tremendous development of vehicles as one of the most essential forms of
transportation has aided human life, but it has also introduced new sorts of chal-
lenges such as traffic congestion, parking issues, and traffic accidents. Researchers
are attempting to tackle these issues by developing ITSs. Intelligent transportation
should be capable of managing, monitoring, and directing people to a more
secure and coordinated mode of transportation. An ITS must, first and foremost,
accurately identify, recognize, and track vehicles in real time [10, 11]. It is
now unarguable that ITSs provide major benefits to both users and operators of
transportation infrastructure. Obtaining information regarding the present state
of transportation infrastructure and transportation parameters is critical for suc-
cessful road-traffic management. A WSN, which can gather relevant information
from spatially distributed sources, is one promising means of acquiring the essen-
tial information. A WSN is made up of simple, low-cost elements (nodes) that can
gather the required data, pre-process it, and send it to a center through wireless
transmission channels. The center can process the data and take relevant interven-
tion action, or it can give the data to the transport system’s operator or to users.
Today, we see that WSNs are becoming an essential component of each ITS [12].
Traditional WSNs are energy-limited and application-specific owing to sensor
node size and cost constraints [5, 13]. As a result, these two features provide seri-
ous barriers to data collection and supplying energy. The sensors in typical WSNs
are primarily supplied with energy-limited batteries, limiting the longevity of
sensor networks. In general, sensors are intended to function for years with a
restricted-energy supply. As a result, energy consumption becomes the most
important design constraint [14].
Extensive research has been undertaken in recent years to extend the lifetime of
WSNs, which may be split into two types [5]. One approach is to cut energy usage
in all aspects as much as possible. Significant work has been devoted to overcom-
ing the energy-saving issue of WSNs through the development of energy-efficient
communication protocols [15–18]. For example, an energy-efficient medium
access control (MAC) protocol for mobile WSNs based on IR-UWB technology
[19] is proposed in Ref. [18]. In the second category, sensors’ stored energy should
382
14 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Toward Intelligent Transportation Systems

be replenished, and most recent research has focused on the fundamental chal-
lenge of energy replenishment. Wireless energy transfer (WET) is a novel tech-
nique, which can be utilized to wirelessly replenish sensor node batteries
[20, 21]. Indeed, WET has been identified as a viable approach for increasing
the longevity of micro-sensors, and so conventional WSNs can be upgraded to
rechargeable WSNs. A number of WC solutions have been developed to offer addi-
tional energy supply for WSNs in order to extend the lifetime of WSNs. With latest
developments in radio energy harvesting (EH) technology [22–28], sensor nodes
can be recharged at a relatively long distance (>10 m). As long-distance charging
produces significantly lower harvesting power, mobile charging methods with
small distances are widely employed to attain maximum efficiency in charging.
Generally speaking, sensor charging is classified into two types [5, 21]. Enabling
sensors to harvest energy from their surroundings is one approach. The most sig-
nificant downside of this strategy is that the EH rates are highly unstable owing to
changing environments throughout time. The alternative option is to use mobile
charging vehicles to drive to sensor nodes’ locations and replenish them via WET.
Sensor nodes may, therefore, be charged with very steady charging rates using
WET technology [29]. As a result, the challenge of energy replenishment may
be turned into a new one of determining an optimal charging route. Thus, current
research has focused on determining the optimal or suboptimal recharging trajec-
tory in order to enhance the efficiency of charging.
14.3
UAV-Based WRSN Charging Scheme for ITSs
The wireless rechargeable sensor network (WRSN) [30], which has a self-charging
mechanism or harvests energy from environmental energies [31], will play an
essential part in the future of smart cities. WRSN offers a broad range of applica-
tions, including environmental monitoring [32] and road state and traffic monitor-
ing [33]. The use of WC with UAVs is an innovative approach for supplying power
for WRSNs. This strategy allows the ongoing deployment of WRSNs to previously
inaccessible sites and decreases the maintenance requirements for constant WC
networks. In this context, Detweiler et al. [34] developed a UAV capable of flying
to faraway sites to charge sensors utilizing magnetic resonant WPT. Caillouet et al.
[35] recommended employing a dedicated charger delivered to the sensor network
by a UAV, allowing energy to be transferred to the sensors through WC techni-
ques. This allows for the ongoing deployment of WRSNs to previously inaccessible
sites and minimizes the requirement for maintenance for continuous WC net-
works. However, since the UAV’s battery capacity is restricted, it should return
to the terrestrial charging station to replenish, reducing charging efficiency. Like-
wise, the low battery capacity of UAVs makes charging sensors distributed over
large regions difficult. According to recent research, UAVs can be powered
14.3 UAV-Based WRSN Charging Scheme for ITSs
383

through WET and used as mobile chargers. Simic et al. [36] describes the use of
WET to charge UAVs, which demonstrates that the WC power is adequate to
recharge their batteries. WPT can also be used by UAVs to charge Internet of
things (IoT) equipment [37]. Despite the fact that the notion of charging UAVs
and UAVs charging IoT equipment has been established [38], the development
of an effective UAV-specific WC strategy in WRSNs remains a difficulty. Prior
research has offered efficient UAV deployment approaches for replenishing
energy, increasing coverage of the chosen location, and assuring service continuity
[39]. Chen et al. [40] presented a novel charging strategy in WRSNs for increased
network-charging capability employing UAVs. They developed a WC pad deploy-
ment problem to apply a minimum number of pads for the UAV to establish at
least one promising routing path to each sensor node in the WRSN. Due to the
widespread penetration and availability of bus networks in metropolitan regions,
buses provide ubiquitous charging opportunities for UAVs [7, 41, 42]. Lin et al. [7]
presented a bus-network-aided UAV WC system that employs a bus network to
supply the UAV’s energy while minimizing the UAV’s flight energy usage when
charging the WRSN. Trotta et al. [41] proposed a new architecture for UAV-based
energy-efficient video surveillance of points of interest (PoIs) in a city. Bus rooftops
are used to recharge UAVs and carry them to the next PoI through existing bus
routes. By combining an online electric vehicle system with a microwave power
transfer system, Jin et al. [42] developed a novel, electric-vehicle charging system
that uses a bus network. UAVs can recharge and increase the range of charging
services by leveraging the bus network. A laser-charged UAV’s trajectory optimi-
zation for charging WRSNs is identified by Liu et al. [30], which is concerned with
optimizing a UAV’s flying trajectory and the traveling plans of a mobile unmanned
vehicle (MUV). The MUV carries a laser transmitter that transmits laser beams to
recharge the UAV’s energy. Won [43], proposed an optimization methodology for
simultaneously optimizing the UAV trajectories and charging station locations.
14.4
Challenges and Advantages of Using UAVs
in WRSN-Based ITSs
As previously stated, wireless rechargeable sensors play an important role in data
collection in ITSs; however, charging these devices when they are spread through-
out vast and hard-to-reach regions can be time consuming. A system can be con-
structed to facilitate charging by remotely charging sensors via radio frequency
(RF) waves. However, one significant problem is that the RF source must be rel-
atively close to the sensors to adequately charge them. A novel technology can be
devised to facilitate charging by employing UAVs to transfer power through RF
signals during a flyby. A UAV can also follow an optimized trajectory that
384
14 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Toward Intelligent Transportation Systems

increases the delivery of energy to the sensors under consideration. The utilization
of WC with UAVs allows the ongoing deployment of WRSNs to previously
unreachable places while also reducing the maintenance needs for continual
WC networks. However, it is vital to consider the UAVs’ restricted capabilities
in carrying out long-duration missions owing to the energy limits imposed by bat-
tery power. Indeed, UAVs must pause their missions to recharge their batteries,
hindering the charging efficiency. As a result, controlling large-scale UAV fleets
must take these constraints into account. Similarly, UAVs’ low battery capacity
makes charging sensors spread across broad areas challenging. The limited battery
energy of UAVs can frequently lead to mission failure, potentially damaging these
devices [44]. Furthermore, while UAV integration with WRSNs-based ITSs can
serve many different purposes, wide-scale deployment of UAV charging infra-
structure is required to increase coverage, which can be very costly. Also, UAVs
can be supplied with large battery capacities, although this increases the UAV’s
weight. Another option is to swap out the batteries once the UAV has landed.
However, this increases the complexity and cost when swapping the system [9].
As a result, a consistent (no need for the UAV to land and no extra flight) and
cost-aware energy procurement framework must be developed to ensure success-
ful, affordable, and safe UAV mission execution.
The UAVs’ flexibility and adaptability enable them to undertake difficult and
remote tasks such as wireless sensor charging in ITS. However, path planning
for UAVs is seen as one of the primary issues that must be solved in order to
enhance their navigation, particularly in urban environments. When deploying
UAVs in urban locations, it is vital to remember that they are fragile and face a
high chance of colliding with environmental impediments. UAV routing and nav-
igation are very critical in order to dramatically enhance UAV operation, reduce
hazards, and boost efficiency [44]. Finally, harsh climate conditions provide sig-
nificant hurdles for the usage of UAVs. Indeed, weather conditions such as cloud,
fog, dust, snow, fog, smog, winds, and atmospheric turbulence affect the perfor-
mance of any UAV-based system.
To accommodate the energy limits of UAVs in the development of the UAV-
based WRSNs charging scheme, we propose a consistent and cost-aware energy
procurement framework for a UAV powered concurrently by laser beams emitted
by locally deployed LBDs and local RE sources. The details are provided in the sub-
sections that follow.
14.4.1
Network Topology
We investigate a network with a UAV, randomly distributed user equipments
(UEs), low-power rechargeable sensor nodes (SNs), and LBDs, as illustrated in
Figure 14.1. The UAV is intended to power the sensors (at predetermined places)
14.4 Challenges and Advantages of Using UAVs in WRSN-Based ITSs
385

in the WRSN-based ITS via WPT. The LBDs, which are placed on the ground and
distributed geographically using a Poisson point process (PPP), ΦL, with density,
λL, provide power to the UAV [45]. Each LBD transmits energy with the same, con-
stant level of power, pL, and the UAV is powered by its closest LBD at any given
moment. As seen in Figure 14.1, we assume that the UAV flies at a fixed height,
HU. It is assumed that if the UAV is placed above a predefined altitude, denoted as
HU,min, the line-of-sight (LoS) links can be established between the UAV and
the LBDs/SNs, i.e., HU,min ≤HU ≤HU,max, where HU,max denotes the maximum
altitude the UAV can fly. We will concentrate on a typical UAV that is placed
at (XU, YU, HU), while the serving LBD is positioned at (XL, YL, 0). As a result,
RL =

L + H2
U represents the distance between the UAV and its serving LBD,
where dL =

indicates their horizontal distance. Given
that a PPP is used to model the positions of the LBDs, the serving LBD’s location
and, by extension, dL, are random variables. Note that a PPP, ΦG, with density, λG,
is also used to model the positions of the SNs.
Apart from the nearest LBD, the UAV is also powered by a local RE source, in
this chapter wind energy, which can be a sustainable RE source. Note that a com-
bination of different RE sources can be considered to balance out the variability of
production of one resource type [46]. Our goal is to minimize the energy

procurement cost at the UAV for an operation cycle divided into T time intervals of
duration, τ. The quantity of energy obtained from an LBD to power the UAV dur-
ing the time period κ
{1, …, T} is denoted by eL
κ (see Figure 14.1). The associated
unit price at the κ-th time period is represented by ρL
κ. This pricing might change
over the operation cycle, depending on the strategy followed by the LBDs. We
assume that the available energy from an LBD is not stored in the battery of
the UAV but is utilized immediately upon the UAV’s energy request. Moreover,
as stated earlier, the UAV has its own internal retailer, i.e., the RE generator,
which generates a particular quantity of energy at each time period κ, denoted
by eR
κ, which is supposed to be cost-free. The energy obtained from the RE source
will be stored in the UAV’s internal battery. It is assumed that the UAV’s internal
battery has a maximum storage capacity, BU. The quantity of energy obtained by
the UAV from its own onboard battery over the κ-th time interval is represented by
eB
κ . As previously stated, the UAV is intended to wirelessly charge a group of
rechargeable SNs by the amount of energy eW
κ
at each time period κ, with the
assumption that this charging occurs at a given price of ρW
κ
(where ρL > ρW). In
other words, the UAV can offset its energy expenses by selling energy to the sen-
sors via WPT.
The energy usage of the UAV at a time period, κ, is also denoted by eU
κ , which
comprises the propulsion, communication, and on-board processing energies. In
fact, the energies eB
κ and eL
κ are used together to fulfill the UAV’s energy consump-
tion at each time period (eU
κ ), i.e., eB
κ + eL
κ = eU
κ , κ
1, …, T . We will see later
that for minimizing the energy procurement costs while meeting the UAV’s energy
consumption, eU, the energies eL and eW cannot take values at the same time. In
other words, the UAV cannot sell energy to the sensor nodes while still harvesting
energy from the nearest LBD. Finally, the energy procurement decisions are cen-
trally managed using an energy control unit (ECU) by gathering all necessary data
from the UAV and LBDs, as illustrated in Figure 14.1. More specifically, the ECU
determines the quantity of energy to be acquired by the UAV from each energy
source throughout the course of the whole operation cycle after obtaining the nec-
essary information from various actors, such as the LBD energy price plan, the RE
information, and the UAV energy consumption [47].
14.4.2
Energy Procurement Optimization
Based on the above explanations, the UAV’s energy procurement cost at each time
period, κ, is formulated as follows:

The minimization of the UAV’s energy procurement cost for an operation cycle
broken down into T time intervals of duration, τ, is our primary goal. Indeed, C,
which reflects the cost of the UAV’s energy exchange with the LBDs and sensors,
can be either positive or negative, based on the quantity of energy received (from
the LBDs) or provided (to the sensors). The minimization of C should be conducted
while keeping the following constraints in mind: (i) The ECU should comply with
the UAV’s energy consumption constraint at each time period, κ (Eq. 14.3). (ii) For
the UAV and time period, κ, the sum of the quantities of energy procured from the
internal battery (eB) and transferred to the SNs (eW) up to the time period, κ, should
not surpass the internal retailer’s produced RE up to the κ-th time period (the left
inequality of Eq. (14.4), with BL denoting the minimum allowable stored energy in
the UAV’s battery). (iii) Lastly, for the inner battery, the quantity of stored energy
cannot be greater than the capacity BU (the right inequality of Eq. (14.4)). In sum-
mary, the minimization problem can be represented as

where pc is the UAV’s communication-related power consumption when

can be addressed using linear programming algorithms [48]. More specifically,
we use YALMIP [49], a toolbox for modeling and optimization in MATLAB,
to solve the above optimization. Lofberg [49] illustrated how straightforward
it is to model complex optimization problems using YALMIP.
14.4.3
Superiorities and Limitations of the Proposed Energy
Framework for the UAVs
Concerning the advantages of the proposed UAV energy framework, it should be
pointed out that UAVs should typically employ a hybrid energy supply architec-
ture combining various sources of energy to maximize longevity and achieve
higher performance. Therefore, it is essential to choose an appropriate energy
388

source hybridization architecture with an optimal energy procurement system to
ensure the efficient operation of modern UAVs. Although all the studies looking
into UAV-related problems concentrated on the energy perspective of average or
instantaneous power consumed/harvested when flying, hovering, processing data,
or communicating, none of them considered the UAV’s energy procurement costs,
nor did they consider determining the optimal amount of energies to be procured
by the UAV from each energy source. Regarding the proposed energy framework’s
shortcomings, it is worth emphasizing that, in practice, RE generation from
sources such as wind and solar power is not deterministic at each time period,
κ, due to its randomness and intermittent nature [50]. In the presence of uncer-
tainty in eR
κ, both inequalities in the second constraint (Eq. (14.4)) of the specified
minimization problem become random quantities, requiring the proposed optimi-
zation to be adjusted, making it complicated and difficult to solve. Thus, the exten-
sion of the current work to model the energy supplied by the internal retailer with
a stochastic process is interesting and will be considered in future work.
The UAV is powered by laser power transfer in our suggested hybrid energy sup-
ply architecture. Laser power transfer has emerged as a potential option for infinite
endurance, and it is envisioned that it would power numerous energy-hungry
UAV missions over large distances. Although various research works (e.g., Refs.
[51, 52]) have provided information about the feasibility of laser power transfer
for UAVs, some major issues are blockage, mobility, and performance in long-
range missions. This approach is limited to specific regions, such as military bases,
airports, and other environments where laser beams are detrimental to human
health and living surroundings [9]. As a result, precautions should be taken to
eliminate retinal risks. The complexity and costly nature of manufacturing the
whole power transfer system is another tangible hurdle in the large-scale deploy-
ment of laser-powered UAVs. Extreme weather also poses significant obstacles for
laser-powered UAVs. Weather conditions and air turbulence influence the diver-
gence, alignment, and power of the laser beam at the UAV [9, 53]. Therefore, sub-
sequent studies must look at climate impacts and mitigation strategies for UAV
laser charging. Table 14.1 compares the proposed energy framework for the
UAV with other UAV charging techniques in various applications.

Simulation Results
A service area of 0.5 km × 0.5 km including one UAV charging the SNs is consid-
ered. We utilize a use-and-store approach, which means that the energy that is
obtainable from the internal retailer is utilized before storing it, i.e., BL = 0. As
mentioned, the MATLAB toolbox YALMIP is used to solve the minimization

problem in Eq. (14.2). Indeed, the energy procurement cost at the UAV is mini-
mized for an operation cycle of one hour divided into T = 60 time intervals of dura-
tion one minute. Unless otherwise specified, we utilize the simulation settings as
listed herein. We also focus on wind energy for our RE generation scenario. The
UAV altitude is set at HU = 5 m, and it flies at a constant velocity, v = 10 m/s. At a
particular time period, the wind speed Vw is decided to be uniformly distributed in
the range [0 m/s, 20 m/s]. We use the wind energy model explained in [50] to
determine the average of eR
κ , which is formulated as 1
2 ρAV 3
wCpτ with air density,
ρ = 1.225 kg/m3, blade swept area, A = 0.04π m2, wind speed, V 3
w that fluctuates
with time, and conversion coefficient, Cp = 0.9.
In Figure 14.2a, at a given time period κ, we can see how changing the UAV’s
flight speed (for a fixed-wing UAV [45, 60]) affects the level of the UAV’s energy
consumption. The figure shows that there is an optimum flying speed at which the
UAV consumes the least amount of energy, eU. For speeds ranging from v
10 m/s
to v
62 m/s, the UAV’s energy consumption, eU, is less than the average amount
of energy procured from the RE source (μR = 4.7Wh) for the given time period;
hence, the UAV will be in a position to sell the excess energy to the SNs by charging
them through a WPT. This does not apply if the UAV’s flight speed goes above
v = 62 m/s or falls behind v = 10 m/s. As can be noticed from Eq. (14.6), eU is a
function of both communication-related energy consumption (i.e., eC = pcτ) and
propulsion-related energy consumption (i.e., eP = ppτ). We can see from the close-
ness of the eU and eP curves that the communication-related energy consumption
is much lower than the propulsion energy consumption and hence can be
neglected. As seen in Figure 14.2b, for a fixed UAV’s flying speed, eU and eP will
remain constant for an operation cycle of one hour. In other words, if the UAV flies
at a constant speed, its energy consumption level stays almost unchanged, assum-
ing that the UE density remains constant throughout the operation cycle. We can
see that, eR, the energy obtained from the RE source (wind energy) fluctuates over
an operation cycle as wind speed varies at each time period.
As shown in Figure 14.3, the optimal solution (i.e., [eW ∗, eB∗, eL∗]) of the minimi-
zation of C in Eq. (14.2) has been obtained for each time period, κ, in an operation
cycle of one hour. For instance, at the 40-th time period (i.e., κ = 40), the amount of
energy received (at the UAV) from its internal battery is near zero (i.e., eB∗
0)
because the procured energy from the wind source has been very small (see
Figure 14.2b). In this condition, the UAV should rely on the nearest LBD to receive
the required energy to continue its mission; hence, eL∗will be high, and obviously
the UAV cannot sell its energy to charge the sensor nodes. When the quantity of
energy procured from the nearest LBD (i.e., eL∗) is large, the energy procurement
cost is high; however, when the amount of energy procured from the LBD is small,
the energy procurement cost is near zero or even negative, based on the quantity of

energy the UAV transfers to the sensor nodes (i.e., eW ∗). Figure 14.4 depicts the
optimal solution (i.e., [eW∗, eB∗, eL∗]) to the minimization of C in Eq. (14.2) for
various UAV flight speeds and for a specified time period, κ. For that time period,
the average amount of energy procured from the RE source is considered,
i.e., μR = 4.7 Wh. For speeds ranging from v
10 m/s to v
62 m/s, the UAV will
be in a position to sell its excess energy to the sensors (the unfilled bars), while
procuring the least amounts of energy from its internal battery (the filled bars).
This is because the UAV’s energy consumption eU is minimal for this range of
flight speed (see Figure 14.2a). For speeds outside of the specified range, the
UAV needs to rely on both the internal battery and the LBDs to fulfill its energy
requirements. Furthermore, the higher amount the UAV acquires energy from the
LBDs, the greater the cost of energy procurement.
As demonstrated by the simulation results in this section, our proposed hybrid
energy supply architecture, which combines various sources of energy to overcome
the UAV’s battery capacity limitations, is consistent in providing energy to the
UAV, allowing the UAV to be used for powering WRSNs-based ITSs without

the need for human assistance. The results indicate that the UAV intends to reduce
its total energy cost for a given cycle of operation by optimizing the quantities of
energy acquired from its internal battery and laser beams at each time period. Fur-
thermore, the simulations determined the amount of extra energy that can be used
to power the sensors in WRSNs-based ITSs utilizing WPT technology by solving
the proposed energy procurement optimization.

Conclusions
In this chapter, we considered the use of WC using UAVs to power WRSNs-based
ITSs. To account for UAV battery and energy restrictions in the development of the
UAV-based WRSNs charging scheme, we provided a consistent and cost-aware
energy procurement framework for a UAV powered concurrently by laser beams
emitted by locally deployed LBDs, local RE sources, and the UAV’s internal bat-
tery. Our proposed hybrid energy supply architecture, which combines various
sources of energy to overcome the UAV’s battery capacity limitations, enables

the UAV to be used for powering WRSNs-based ITSs without affecting UAV oper-
ation or causing significant service disruptions, and without the need for human
assistance. Indeed, choosing an appropriate energy source hybridization architec-
ture with an ideal energy procurement system is critical in ensuring the efficient
functioning of the UAV. Furthermore, unlike previous works that ignored the
UAV’s energy procurement costs, we looked into the UAV’s energy procurement
costs to determine the optimal amount of energies to be acquired by the UAV from
each energy source. The UAV intends to lower its overall energy cost for a given
operation cycle by optimizing the quantities of energy obtained from its own inter-
nal battery and laser beams at each time period. Furthermore, by solving the pro-
posed energy procurement optimization, we estimated the amount of extra energy
that can be utilized to power the sensors in WRSNs using the WPT technology.

Introduction
The field of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) is rapidly evolving as tech-
nology advances and the demand for autonomous vehicles increases. Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) have gained considerable attention because, as eve-
ryone can understand, they can revolutionize the transportation sector. ITS is a
convergence of information and communication technology, sensors, controllers,
and advanced algorithms aimed at enhancing transportation safety, mobility, envi-
ronmental sustainability, and productivity [1].
The integration of state-of-the-art technologies such as machine learning and
artificial intelligence can help autonomous vehicles to optimize their routes and
improve their decision-making abilities in critical tasks. Previous research has
demonstrated the benefits of using deep learning, imitation learning, and Rein-
forcement Learning (RL) algorithms in autonomous driving personalization [2, 3].
Despite the advancements in passive safety technology, many challenges are still
open for autonomous driving, including traffic optimization, driver comfort, etc.
The development of the Vehicular ad hoc Network (VANET) as part of the ITS
worldwide gave rise to many potential solutions to these challenges. The main goal
of VANET is to increase the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. VANET
consists of two main components: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication and
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication [4].
Over the past decade, the demand for vehicles equipped with ADAS and
autonomous driving capabilities has increased dramatically. AUTOMOTIVE
companies have contributed to this trend by promoting their ADAS systems as

personalization options and do not add to the driver’s and passengers’ comfort
and safety. To address these challenges, researchers and companies are working
to improve the safety and performance of autonomous driving systems, as well
as to personalize the driving experience, by providing various driving modes that
better fit the drivers’ profiles.
The main objective of this chapter is to study how autonomous vehicles, moving
in intelligent interconnected transportation networks, can take advantage of novel
machine learning techniques and more specifically to demonstrate how RL and
Federated Learning (FL) can be efficiently combined to develop efficient and per-
sonalized solutions.
Our previous work [2] proposed the use of an RL model for adapting the driv-
ing modes of an autonomous car to the driver’s personal preferences, whilst
considering the road conditions and the driver’s state, including stress and
excitement levels. By combining this information by correctly interpreting traffic
regulations, it is possible to ensure safe vehicle operation and personalize its
operation, to meet the driver’s preferences, taking into account the subjectivity
of human factors such as stress, excitement, and psychological and physical
conditions.
Until now, all the existing autonomous driving solutions lack personalization
and do not take advantage of the collective intelligence that can be available from
multiple vehicles. FL can be a solution that takes advantage of the collective
experiences of multiple autonomous vehicles to enhance the personalization of
autonomous driving models. This distributed machine learning technique allows
training individual models and aggregating their updates to improve the models
across the network. The resulting models learn faster and can be continually
refined in real time, taking into consideration the specific driving conditions
and behaviors of each driver. By leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple
drivers, FL leads to greater accuracy and performance in autonomous driving, thus
providing safer and more efficient driving experiences for all users.
The development of intelligent interconnected transportation networks encom-
passes not just information and communication technologies but also energy man-
agement. In the pursuit of sustainable mobility, the significance of energy sources
and their efficient utilization cannot be overstated. In this regard, the integration
of autonomous vehicle systems with modern multi-energy networks presents a tre-
mendous opportunity. While autonomous vehicles primarily focus on optimizing
their routes and decision-making capabilities, it is crucial to also consider the effec-
tive utilization of diverse energy sources, including electric power and renewable
fuels, which may be accessible within transportation networks. By seamlessly inte-
grating autonomous vehicles into these multi-energy networks, a comprehensive
15.1 Introduction

approach to transportation can be realized, fostering energy efficiency, reducing
emissions, and advancing sustainability.
The utilization of FL presents compelling advantages in terms of energy effi-
ciency, making it a fitting choice for harnessing the potential of Modern Multi-
Energy Networks. By decentralizing data processing and distributing the workload
to edge nodes, FL significantly reduces the energy consumption associated with
centralized processing in the cloud. This approach optimizes resource allocation
and taps into the computational capabilities of edge devices, thereby mitigating
the dependence on energy-intensive cloud infrastructure. Moreover, the seamless
integration of FL with Modern Multi-Energy Networks allows for dynamic energy
management. By leveraging diverse energy sources, including renewable power
and smart grid infrastructure, we establish a solid foundation for energy-efficient
and sustainable autonomous driving systems. Embracing FL not only enhances
energy efficiency but also enables us to leverage the full potential of Modern
Multi-Energy Networks, propelling the evolution of intelligent and sustainable
transportation forward.
Motivated to provide such experiences for all users, our contribution involves
utilizing FL to improve the personalization of autonomous driving models. By
leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple autonomous vehicles, this
approach allows for faster learning, continual refinement, and ultimately greater
accuracy and performance in autonomous driving. It also provides energy effi-
ciency, since the distributed approach of FL leverages the processing load for cen-
tralized servers and balances between the edge and the cloud.
The contributions of this chapter can be summarized as follows:
• It performs a comprehensive survey of the various aspects related to the delivery
of personalized autonomous vehicle systems in intelligent transportation
networks.
• It combines RL with FL to personalize the driving experience while leveraging
collective intelligence from multiple vehicles.
• It performs an experimental evaluation of the proposed solution in a simulated
environment and proves its superiority.
Our work is structured as follows. In Section 15.2, we present the current
advancements in the field of ITS and the usage of machine learning algorithms
to strengthen the safety and reliability of ADAS and improve the driving experi-
ence for drivers and passengers. Section 15.3 focuses on the importance of RL
in the personalization of driving experience, whereas Section 15.4 explains how
it can be combined with FL, and how collective knowledge can be beneficial
for drivers providing a more personalized and energy-efficient experience that
optimally uses the multi-energy network resources. Section 15.5 illustrates the
experimental setup and the results we achieved in a simulated environment.

Finally, Section 15.6 provides a comparison of the pros and cons of ADAS and
autonomous driving personalization and sets the main concerns around the secu-
rity and robustness of the proposed approach.

Related Work
The research work that relates to autonomous vehicular systems in intelligent
transportation networks [5] spans various aspects from communications, machine
learning, and the use of ADAS in an efficient manner. In this section, we illustrate
the various aspects in Figure 15.1 and provide more details on each aspect in what
follows.
15.2.1
Vehicle Communications
Various ITS and their applications have made use of wireless technologies such as
Wi-Fi, WiMAX, 4G LTE, and 5G to meet their data transfer requirements [6, 7]. In
the near future, wireless technology will be utilized to enable swift and secure
communication between mobile vehicles and transportation network infrastruc-
ture. This will demand fast data acquisition, dependable connections, and strin-
gent data protection measures [4].
VANET is a widely studied method for data delivery in vehicular communi-
cation [8]. The mesh network comprises mobile nodes that necessitate routing
protocols to steer the network traffic, taking into consideration the vehicle’s
position and its intended destination. Great examples of VANET-based applications
aretrafficmonitoringandincidentdetection[9].TheabilityofVANETtoalertdrivers
to potential dangers and allow them to adapt their driving mode can help accident
prevention and increase road safety [4]. In V2V communication, vehicles exchange
information such as position, speed, heading, and brake status, alerting drivers to
potential dangers. In contrast to V2V, V2I communication involves the exchange
of information between vehicles and the infrastructure. The infrastructure can be
streetlights and traffic signals equipped with Roadside Units (RSUs) that communi-
cate with the Onboard Units (OBUs) in vehicles to share real-time environmental
conditions, such as weather and road conditions [10].
In the last few years, we have seen great advancements in the field of
communications, and VANET to make way for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV),
which comprise humans, vehicles, and inroad objects that seamlessly communi-
cate to improve the driving experience [11].
By enhancing the exchange of information between vehicles, infrastructure,
and people, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications equip vehicles with
precise environmental information. V2X improves the driving environment by

improving traffic flow, reducing pollution and accidents, and providing improved
driving experiences with features such as route recommendations and automatic
parking [11].
The development of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICV) has increased the
need for improved wireless network performance in terms of bandwidth, connec-
tion stability, and transmission speed. 4G LTE technology has been found to have
advantages in meeting these demands and has been applied in several vehicle
networking projects with the V2V and V2I. However, the requirement for faster
network speeds and greater bandwidth led to the emergence of Fifth-Generation
Networks (5G), which use wireless broadband connections to transmit larger data
volumes and facilitate the implementation of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communications and applications in autonomous vehicles [7].
The concept behind 6G is to build upon existing 5G technology and to incorpo-
rate additional technologies such as satellite communications, AI, and big data.
This new technology will enable significant advancements in vehicular network
technology and is expected to bring even more advanced applications for the
IoV than what is currently possible with 5G. With the integration of these technol-
ogies, 6G has the potential to revolutionize the way vehicles communicate and
share information, enabling a safer and more efficient driving experience for
all [12].
15.2.2
Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems and Machine Learning
A modern ADAS architecture includes four main components – longitudinal con-
trol, lateral control, driver’s attentiveness monitoring system, and parking assis-
tance [13]. According to Li et al. [14], the functions of ADAS can be categorized
into three primary tasks: detecting traffic signs, detecting the road system, and
detecting moving objects.
Traffic Sign Detection is an important task for ADAS systems due to its role in
ensuring safety on the road. The camera-based approaches are the most popular
ones, because of their advanced technology for analyzing visual data and proces-
sing images effectively. Machine learning-based methods, which are considered
fast and simple, have been widely used to recognize traffic signs. A technique
for traffic signal recognition using semi-supervised learning was introduced in a
study conducted by He et al. [15]. The authors have used a limited number of
labeled signs to train models based on color, edge features, and Histogram of
Oriented Gradient (HOG) features. They then added high-confidence samples into
the labeled dataset for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
Arcos-García et al. [16] have compared algorithms such as R-CNN, R-FCN,
SSD, and YOLO for object detection in color images. In a related study, Liang
et al. [17] employed a ResNet-50 network as a basis for a pyramidal framework
15.2 Related Work
405

for small-size signs detection. Meanwhile, [18] proposed a solution to recognize
traffic signals in adverse weather conditions, focusing on small-size and low-
resolution images, using a multi-scale cascaded R-CNN.
Sensor fusion has been demonstrated in several studies to improve the accuracy
of traffic sign detection tasks. For example, Guan et al. [19] integrated multiple
sources of data, such as mobile LiDAR and digital images, to enhance the locali-
zation performance of monocular cameras. Similarly, Balado et al. [20] fused input
from a LiDAR sensor, a 360 camera, and a GPS-based mobile mapping system to
locate traffic signs. Another study by Hirabayashi et al. [21] proposed a method
for recognizing traffic lights based on visual analysis and spatial mapping
information.
The importance of Road Detection in ADAS is well known. Those systems can
include a range of automatic assistance systems, such as lane departure warning,
lane centering, lane change assistance, adaptive cruise control (ACC), inter-
section assistance, and more. The camera-based approach is the most widely used
due to the extensive knowledge of computer vision and the cost-effectiveness of
cameras. Among the various deep learning algorithms, CNNs have shown supe-
rior performance in image processing, and their application in traffic detection
has grown rapidly [22]. In a study, a lane detection technique was proposed by
Ye et al. [23] that transforms the lane structure in the image into a waveform.
Another system proposed by Zou et al. [24] employs deep CCNs and deep Recur-
rent Neural Networks (DRNN) to decrease the occurrence of false negatives in lane
detection. Li et al. [25] proposed a multi-task deep convolutional network that
integrates CNN and RNN detectors for lane structure modeling and lane boundary
detection, respectively. Hou et al. [26] introduced a self-train, unsupervised
method based on self-attention distillation. Similarly, Xiao et al. [27] in order to
detect lane markers presented a module that combines self-attention and channel
attention.
To enhance the accuracy and robustness of road detection, researchers have
explored the use of sensor fusion techniques. For example, Caltagirone et al.
[28] introduced a fusion CNN model that integrates camera images and LiDAR
point clouds for road detection. This approach employs cross-connections between
the two sensor information processing branches in all layers, resulting in superior
performance compared to other FCN systems. Another study by Chen et al. [22]
proposed a progressive LiDAR adaptation-aided road detection method that aligns
3D LiDAR data with perspective view and applies a cascaded fusion structure for
feature adaptation. This approach significantly enhances the reliability of detect-
ing roads in urban environments. In addition, stereo camera systems can provide
3D information about the environment, which may assist in road detection.
The Moving Object Detection task refers to the detection and classification of
objects in the surrounding environment of the vehicle. For this kind of task, we
406
15 Autonomous Vehicle Systems in Intelligent Interconnected Transportation Networks

have three approaches based on camera, LiDAR, and sensor fusion. The camera-
based approaches are widely used in object detection due to their direct color view
capture ability. However, camera-based approaches face limitations like low-
resolution capture features during dusky lighting conditions. Kim et al. [29] pro-
posed a modified Faster R-CNN, which added random additive white Gaussian
noise to improve the robustness of the system against noise and illumination.
To improve the detection performance in bad weather conditions, three deep
learning approaches based on YOLO were proposed by Li et al. [30]. Guan
et al. [31] presented a pedestrian detection framework that utilized monocular
and thermal camera data to achieve high accuracy in various lighting conditions.
Moreover, Henein et al. [32] proposed a dynamic Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) algorithm that uses an RGB-D camera to extract velocity
information.
LiDAR-based approaches are suitable for detecting small objects and for obtain-
ing distance information. Improving pedestrian selection to prevent collisions can
be achieved using 3D LiDAR data and a pre-trained support vector machines
(SVM) classifier, as proposed by Wang et al. [33]. Various factors are taken into
account by this method, including the initial position and velocity of the host vehi-
cle as well as the surrounding information. Real-time object detection and classi-
fication using YOLO-v2 was introduced by Ali et al. [34], which uses grid maps
generated from a bird’s-eye view in order to be used for feature extraction and
marks 3D bounding boxes. The VoxelNet architecture was presented by Zhou
and Tuzel [35], which employs a trainable deep network to unify feature extraction
and 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, Yang et al. [36] developed a multi-view
semantic learning network (MVSLN) based on LiDAR data that uses multiple
views to preserve features and incorporates a spatial recalibration fusion module
for 3D object detection in the RPN module.
Sensor fusion methods combine the advantages of different sensors to provide
more accurate and real-time results. Asvadi et al. [37] propose a real-time method
for detecting vehicles using multiple modes. The approach employed a fusion of a
color camera and 3D LiDAR to achieve its objective. The 3D LiDAR provided
dense-depth and reflectance maps, while the camera helped align the 3D LiDAR
data to reduce misdetection rates. The data from these two sensors were used as
inputs to a Deep ConvNet-based framework to generate bounding boxes of each
vehicle in the detection results. A different approach was taken in a study con-
ducted by Gao et al. [38], which proposed a sensor fusion detection method that
combines CNN with image up-sampling theory. To overcome the limitations of
RGB cameras, this method utilized the point cloud from LiDAR data to extract
depth features. In a complementary object identification approach, Zhao et al.
[39] fused 3D LiDAR and a vision camera to make better use of the LiDAR sensor.
The object region was extracted from the 3D spatial information and used as inputs
15.2 Related Work
407

to a CNN model for feature extraction and object classification. Similarly, Chen
et al. [40] developed an object detection system that fused input from a 3D LiDAR
and a stereo camera to improve the accuracy of 2D bounding boxes. The utilization
of depth and stereo information from the camera enabled the efficient computa-
tion of 2D bounding boxes into 3D bounding boxes.
15.2.3
Personalization
Although personalization is a concept that has attracted significant interest in var-
ious disciplines, it is a new trend in the area of automotive [41]. ADAS are a critical
application area for personalization in the automotive industry [1]. The personal-
ization of driver-assistance systems aims to improve the experience of drivers and
passengers and tailor vehicle behavior to individual needs and preferences. This
can be accomplished either explicitly by providing drivers with a range of prede-
fined system settings or implicitly by inferring the driver’s preferences based on
their behavior, according to Fan and Poole [42]. Starting with ACC, a driving com-
fort system that maintains a steady speed as set by the driver while keeping a safe
distance from the leading vehicle, personalization can play a critical role. The
cruise control system can be a very helpful solution, but still reduces the driver’s
freedom in choosing custom speeds for varying road conditions (e.g., highway or in
the city, day or night, with traffic or not). The personalization of ACC has to con-
sider these conditions and adjust the driving speed accordingly. Two types of
approaches have been proposed so far for this task: group-based and individual-
based. However, all the approaches focus on deactivating ACC based on a perso-
nalized safety distance limit from the leading vehicle or obstacle.
In the research of Rosenfeld et al. [43], a clustering approach has been used to
group drivers based on their driving behavior and other demographic information.
Then the appropriate safety distance was determined for each of the three driving
profile clusters. In the work of Canale et al. [44], three predefined profile classes
have been employed and each driver was assigned to one of the driving profile
classes. Depending on the class of the driver, different parameters are used by
the ACC that controlled the vehicle acceleration.
In order to adapt ACC to the individual driver’s style, Bifulco et al. [45] proposed
a real-time speed adaptation model that was tested on a linear car following setup.
The model used a recursive least squares (RLS) filter that predicted the best speed
for keeping a proper safety distance. In a similar car-following scenario, the per-
sonalized ADAS of Lefevre et al. [46] combined a hidden Markov-based driver
model with a Gaussian mixture regression for predicting the desired acceleration
value for each individual driving style. The personalized ACC system of Chen et al.
[47] used RL to adjust the vehicle speed to the strategies of different drivers while
driving in dynamic traffic conditions. The model combined a PID controller for
408
15 Autonomous Vehicle Systems in Intelligent Interconnected Transportation Networks

controlling the brake and throttle with different driving profiles and managed
to keep safe distances in varying scenarios, while providing a smooth driving
experience. Finally, a longitudinal driver-assistance system that integrates ACC
that adapts to the driver preferences was prototyped by Wang et al. [48]. The
authors proposed a linear driver model for simulating the use of throttle and brake
based on the distance to the leading vehicle and validated their approach in real
traffic tests.
The forward collision warning (FCW) are increasingly popular safety
features in modern vehicles and are highly related to speed control in ADAS.
However, false alarms can be frustrating for drivers, so personalized FCW systems
have been proposed to reduce false alarm rates and increase early warning times
for a longer driver reaction time. One approach is presented by Muehlfeld et al.
[49] who use statistical behavior modeling to estimate a driver-specific probability
distribution of danger levels for determining the activation threshold of the warn-
ing algorithm. Wang et al. [50] proposes a real-time identification algorithm that
adjusts warning thresholds online and reduces false warning rates. Govindarajan
et al. [51] also proposes a personalized approach for estimating the reaction time
for each driver in case of emergency braking and developed an FCW system that
better adapts to the driver’s preferences.
Lefevre et al. [52] proposes a personalized framework that uses a driver model to
predict lane departures and a model predictive controller to keep the vehicle in the
lane. The system minimizes false alarm rates by detecting lane departures early.
Similarly, Wang et al. [53] employ a personalized technique that involves the
use of a hidden Markov model that is based on a Gaussian mixture model to detect
early whether a driver will correct a lane deviation without being alerted.
According to Wang et al. [53], a personalized approach for predicting lane depar-
ture behavior was developed using a hidden Markov model based on a Gaussian
mixture model. The model’s aim is to predict whether a driver will correct a lane
departure behavior without receiving a warning.
The topic of personalization has been explored in relation to lane keeping and
departure prediction. To illustrate, Wang et al. [54] put forward a strategy that cus-
tomizes the steering system and assists drivers to minimize the necessary wheel
adjustments for following a path, thus providing a smoother and comfortable
change of angle. The steering ratio is modified based on the driver’s path-following
tendencies. This method was evaluated in a simulation study and was observed to
enhance drivers’ performance in path following, lessen their cognitive and phys-
ical workload, and reduce steering angle variability. Additionally, Schnelle et al.
[55] trained personalized models for path following and steering that simulate
the driving style of individual drivers for various maneuver types.
Cooperative Assistance is an automation in ADAS that has gained increasing
attention as an approach to enhance the safety and convenience of driving. The
15.2 Related Work
409

idea entails offering specific assistance features upon receiving direct requests
from the driver, usually through speech commands. Cooperative ADAS, such as
the overtaking assistant, aim to work together with drivers by responding to direct
requests, usually through spoken commands, regarding adjacent cars during high-
way overtaking maneuvers. As drivers vary in skills and experience, it is crucial to
customize cooperative ADAS to their individual competencies and capacities. In a
study using a driving simulator, Schömig et al. [56] showed that most drivers pre-
ferred a speech-based on-demand assistance system, which mimics an attentive
co-driver, over a visual head-up display of information. The study focused on
an intersection scenario in which the driver has to turn left from a smaller to a
major road. Moreover, Orth et al. [57] demonstrated that estimating acceptable
gaps for each driver could enhance personalized acceptance of the on-demand
assistance system. This system allows drivers to control the activation of the assis-
tant system based on the specific situation and automatically adjusts parameters
based on observed driving behaviors, showing an active and adaptable approach to
personalization.
To provide drivers with personalized assistance during a Lane change maneu-
ver based on their driving style, researchers have proposed different approaches.
Butakov and Ioannou [58] suggested a methodology for lane change profile mod-
eling, which was based on a parametric lane change model and a Gaussian mix-
ture model that personalizes multiple model parameters, such as gap acceptance
and longitudinal fixes that affect the resulting maneuver. This model can operate
in real time and continuously update during driving. The approach of Vallon
et al. [59] models the driver’s behavior in lane-changing scenarios and uses
SVM for mapping each driver to the best behavior class. The researchers vali-
dated their approach using offline playback and demonstrated its ability to learn
individual driving behaviors for various drivers. Both methods aim to assist dri-
vers in performing a lane change while considering safety and comfort and tak-
ing into account the surrounding traffic.
In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research devoted to
driver modeling. Personalization of ADAS parameters has been a focus, with
options ranging from warning thresholds to driving characteristic features for
longitudinal and lateral control systems. Although current prototypes typically
personalize only one ADAS, a more comprehensive personalization concept
is becoming necessary. This concept should consider how personalization
information can be shared between different ADAS components. A modular
approach that separates ADAS, personalization modules, and human-machine
interfaces is recommended for designing interactive, personalized systems.
This approach allows for more sophisticated and nuanced system adaptation
while still enabling drivers to have direct control and understanding of the
system [60].

15.2.4
Federated Learning on ITSs
In 2017, Google introduced FL, a decentralized and collaborative learning approach
that enables distributed nodes to train a global model [61]. The FL architecture
involves an aggregator agent and multiple federated nodes, each of which trains
the model on its locally stored data. The nodes generate model updates, which
the aggregator agent combines to create a new global model that is then distributed
to all nodes.
Recently, Manias and Shami [62] suggested using RSUs as federated nodes in
ITSs to enhance FL applications. Given that RSUs are equipped with sensors
and processing capabilities, they are well suited for FL applications. The study
focuses on image processing as a key application for FL on RSUs, ranging from
pedestrian detection to collision reporting. FL is applied across all RSUs to over-
come data imbalance, enabling the collective use of all RSU data and the distribu-
tion of a complete model to RSUs that would not otherwise have enough data to
train their own model. Furthermore, FL can exploit the differences in conditions,
such as lighting, in RSU-collected images, improving object detection and model
performance, thereby enhancing safety in ITSs. Overall, the paragraph under-
scores the crucial role of FL in ITSs and highlights the potential benefits of using
RSUs as federated nodes.
Multimodal evaluation of perception technologies is critical in order to over-
come the limitations of individual sensors [63]. However, the contradictory con-
clusions that may arise due to imprecise or inaccurate data highlight the need
for collaborative computing and multi-agent collaborative perception in vehic-
ular IoT systems [64]. FL can be used to efficiently combine knowledge from
multiple vehicles, improving the accuracy of perception systems [65]. To enable
decentralized FL in vehicular networks, vehicle clustering approaches can be
employed to select central servers for FL [66]. Global model dissemination can
be achieved using broadcast protocols, while model updates from clients to the
central server can be carried out using unicast protocols [67].
Recent research has shown that resource allocation is a significant challenge
in vehicular Internet of Things (IoT). The allocation of limited resources such as
communication, computing, and storage resources among agents is critical for the
overall system performance. However, conventional mathematical optimization
approaches have limitations in solving the resource allocation problem in the
vehicular environment due to the complexity and imprecise information observed
in each vehicle. To address this problem, neural network techniques have been
proposed to leverage big data to solve the resource allocation problem. In partic-
ular, the FL approach that uses neural networks in local training is a promising
way to solve the resource allocation problem for vehicular IoT. FL allows each
vehicle to use its own data to train the model and ensures privacy preservation
15.2 Related Work
411

by not sharing the raw data among agents. The sharing of the trained
models allows the overall system to benefit from the diversity of data across the
vehicles [68].
FL’s ability to preserve privacy during the model training process makes it an
attractive solution for privacy-sensitive applications. The collaboration of multiple
agents in FL, each one using its own data for training, leads to the second main
advantage of FL, data availability. FL is particularly useful in resource-
constrained nodes with low processing capabilities, such as those present in
MEC IoV systems, as it enables the utilization of global data while processing only
local data. FL also exhibits communication efficiency during model training, as
there is no data transfer between local nodes and the aggregation agent, and no
communication between nodes. Compared to centralized collaborative learning
strategies, FL’s communication efficiency is a significant advantage. In a fault
or failure mitigation scenario, FL demonstrates another key advantage. If a local
node goes offline or loses connectivity, the FL training process can continue
normally with the remaining nodes. The aggregator agent can quickly push the
current global model to the node when communication is restored, and the node
can resume operation and restore performance [62].
15.3
Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
Personalization
The personalization of the driving experience can be achieved by adapting the
autonomous system behavior to the needs and preferences of the driver and pas-
sengers. One way to achieve this is by using machine learning models to adjust the
driving mode (output) dynamically to the current driver state and the overall driv-
ing conditions (input). The use of RL algorithms is a solution in this direction. The
formulation of the problem as an RL task requires a clear definition of the obser-
vation space, action space, and reward function. The observation space (world
state) includes all available sensor data from the car, such as velocity and acceler-
ation, as well as environmental conditions such as weather. These inputs will be
utilized by the model to make decisions. The action space involves determining
the types of actions that can be taken by the car and their forms, such as the selec-
tion of a driving profile. The reward function, which guides the model by
rewarding or punishing actions, is a challenging aspect of RL and requires careful
consideration. The components of an RL problem formulation are presented in
Figure 15.2.
In our approach, the goal is to create a system that utilizes the vehicle’s ADAS
components and personalizes the driving experience. Its main objective is to
412
15 Autonomous Vehicle Systems in Intelligent Interconnected Transportation Networks

minimize the stress levels of the driver. To narrow down the task to a specific
implementation, we assume control of the vehicle’s advanced cruise control,
which has three driving modes (conservative, normal, and sport). Our implemen-
tation is based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [69],
which takes as input information from the world and the driver to change between
different driving modes of the cruise control. However, we would like to point out
that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to selecting the best RL
algorithm. Each vehicle and its ADAS subsystems have unique characteristics,
and there may be algorithms with better performance for specific subsystems.
Nevertheless, we aim to demonstrate how RL can be applied to enhance ADAS func-
tionality, rather than determine the best RL algorithm for autonomous driving.
PPO is a model-free, on-policy algorithm equipped with internal mechanisms to
fully utilize and collected data. It works by updating its policy using samples col-
lected from the environment and using a surrogate objective function that approxi-
mates the true objective of maximizing the expected reward. PPO is designed to be
stable and efficient, and it achieves this by using two key techniques: clipping and
value function fitting. The clipping technique is used to prevent the policy from
changing too much between updates, which can cause instability. It does this by
restricting the change in the policy within a certain range. The value function fit-
ting technique, on the other hand, involves updating the value function separately
from the policy and using it to estimate the advantage of a state-action pair. This
advantage estimate is used in the surrogate objective function, which helps to
improve the stability of the algorithm.

The clipped surrogate objective function that follows is the objective function
that is maximized during training to improve the policy:
Lclip θ = Et min rt θ At, clip rt θ , 1 −ε, 1 + ε At
15 1
It is a clipped version of the policy gradient objective, which includes an addi-
tional term that prevents the new policy from deviating too much from the old
policy. The clipped surrogate objective function is defined as the minimum of
two terms. The first term is the product of the probability ratio rt(θ) and the advan-
tage estimate At. The second term is the clipped probability ratio (which is con-
strained in a range of 1 −ε to 1 + ε) multiplied by the advantage estimate.
The advantage estimate is calculated for each time step t using the following
equation:

It is the difference between the discounted sum of rewards from time step t and
the estimated value function V(st) at time step t. The value function estimate V(st + 1)
is also included in the calculation to account for future rewards.
The value loss function that is minimized during training is as follows:
LVF θ = Et
V st −V t

15 3
It measures the difference between the estimated value function V(st) and the
empirical estimate of the value function Vt for each time step t. The hat symbol
(^) represents an estimate of the expected value.
Finally, the clipped surrogate objective loss for PPO is as follows:
Lt θ = Et Lclip
t
θ −c1LVF
t
θ + c2S πθ st
15 4
In these formulas, θ represents the parameters of the policy network, rt repre-
sents the probability ratio between the new and old policies, V represents the value
function estimated by the value network, st represents the state at time step t, Vt
represents the empirical estimate of the value function at time step t, c1 and c2 are
coefficients, the S denotes an entropy bonus, πθ is a stochastic policy, and ε is a
hyperparameter that controls the magnitude of the clipping.
The architecture of PPO is similar to the Actor-Critic family of algorithms but
differs in a few critical points. PPO combines the minimization of a surrogate
objective function, which maximizes the expected reward with limited change
in the policy, with the clipping mechanism that limits the amount by which the
new policy can deviate from the old one. All of them work together and create
a robust and sample-efficient algorithm [70].

In our implementation, PPO takes as input the vehicle’s velocity and angular
velocity, the route’s conditions at any moment defined by the expected change
in direction in order to stay on route, the speed limit, the weather conditions,
and the time of the day (day or night). For the evaluation of every decision of
the algorithm, we used the driver’s stress level as a reward function. We used a
function to simulate the stress level of a driver, based on the vehicle and route con-
ditions at any moment. Of course, in real conditions, we could use a sensor
attached to the driver in order to measure the electrodermal activity and the heart
rate and determine the stress levels.
15.4
Federated Reinforcement Learning
The utilization of PPO is a promising approach for addressing certain challenges in
autonomous driving. However, to fully exploit its benefits, it is necessary to lever-
age the collective knowledge of multiple agents to overcome certain drawbacks.
One such challenge is the very common problem in any personalization task,
namely the “cold start” problem [71], which occurs when the system gives bad
recommendations to new users with unknown preferences and takes some time
to converge. The effect of this problem can be mitigated by utilizing a model from
a similar driver with known preferences. Another challenge is the time required
for an agent to learn a new task, such as driving in different weather conditions
than those it has been trained. This can be achieved by leveraging the experience
of multiple agents exposed to different conditions. Finally, it is critical to have gen-
eralized models in the vehicles that can handle previously unseen conditions,
which can be achieved by utilizing collective knowledge. In the context of ADAS,
the combination of PPO and FL can boost the performance of the PPO and over-
come the previous challenges.
In this work, we implement a combination of PPO with a common FL tech-
nique, the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) [72]. The approach consists of multiple
agents with PPO models deployed at the edge. Each edge model is trained with the
available states of its corresponding agent, and after a predefined number of epi-
sodes, the agents upload the weights of their models to a cloud mechanism. The
cloud mechanism then calculates the federated average of all models, generates a
new global model, and sends a signal to each agent to download the updated
model. Finally, the new global model replaces the current version of the model
and the training continues. The total workflow is presented in Figure 15.3.
The objective of the federated approach is to leverage the knowledge learned
from similar drivers in different conditions and make the new model applicable
to the same drivers in unseen conditions. The choice of the PPO algorithm was
15.4 Federated Reinforcement Learning

motivated by its unique policy update mechanisms, which provide stability in the
learning process and a stable policy update, even with the use of a nonoptimal fed-
erated technique such as FedAvg [73].
15.4.1
Advantages and Challenges from the Combined Use
of Reinforcement Learning and Federated Learning
In the field of autonomous driving, the implementation of PPO and FL in combi-
nation is proving to be an effective approach to address the various challenges that
arise. This approach leverages the collective knowledge of multiple agents to over-
come the “cold start” problem, where an agent requires a significant amount of
time and data to learn a new task. With the use of PPO and FL, agents can share
data and learn from each other, thus reducing the time required for an agent to
learn a new task. This, in turn, allows for the quick adaptation of autonomous driv-
ing systems to changing driving conditions and situations.
Additionally, this combination allows for the handling of previously unseen
conditions, such as unexpected obstacles or road conditions, which can be diffi-
cult to anticipate or simulate during the learning process. With PPO and FL, the
collective knowledge of multiple agents can be used to identify and adapt to these

new conditions, thus improving the overall functionality of ADAS systems.
Moreover, FL provides stability in the learning process and a stable policy
update, allowing for better coordination and communication between agents,
leading to more effective decision-making and smoother operation of autono-
mous driving systems.
Overall, the combination of PPO and FL offers a promising approach to addres-
sing the challenges of autonomous driving and enhancing the functionality of
ADAS systems. This approach leverages the collective knowledge of multiple
agents, reduces the time required for an agent to learn a new task, and allows
for the handling of previously unseen conditions. By using this approach, auton-
omous driving systems can quickly adapt to changing driving conditions, making
them more reliable, efficient, and safe for all road users.
While the combination of PPO and FL offers many advantages for autonomous
driving, there are also several challenges that must be addressed. One of the main
challenges is the issue of privacy and security, as sharing data between agents can
potentially compromise sensitive information. Additionally, the coordination and
communication between multiple agents can be complex, requiring sophisticated
algorithms and frameworks to ensure effective collaboration. Another challenge is
the potential for overfitting, where the agents may become too specialized in a par-
ticular task, leading to a loss of flexibility and adaptability. Finally, there is also the
issue of computational complexity, as the use of multiple agents and FL can
require significant computational resources and time, making it difficult to imple-
ment in real-time applications. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the
successful implementation of the PPO and FL approach in autonomous driving
systems.

The Impact of Intelligent Transportation Networks
on Interconnected Multi-Energy Networks
In intelligent interconnected energy networks, various multi-energy technologies
can be utilized to support the optimal scheduling of energy resources. These tech-
nologies encompass a range of energy carriers, including electricity, hydrogen, and
natural gas. Each of these energy sources offers distinct advantages and can play a
significant role in the efficient operation of transportation systems.
Hydrogen is a pivotal multi-energy technology that holds great promise for fuel
cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). FCEVs utilize hydrogen fuel cells to convert stored
hydrogen into electricity, emitting nothing more than water vapor as a byproduct.
Hydrogen can be produced through various methods, including electrolysis pow-
ered by renewable energy sources. The utilization of hydrogen as an energy car-
rier presents exciting prospects for vehicles with long-range capabilities and rapid
refueling, making it a suitable choice for specific transportation applications.
15.4 Federated Reinforcement Learning
417

Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also
employed in multi-energy networks. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) emit fewer
emissions than traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. They offer a transitional
solution towards cleaner energy options while utilizing the existing natural gas
infrastructure. Vehicles using natural gas contribute to diversifying the fuel
mix, leading to enhanced air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
Finally, electricity is gaining the attention of the automotive industry with electric
vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The advancements in
battery technology and charging infrastructure make electricity a practical and
sustainable option for powering autonomous vehicles and allow smart electric
(or hybrid) vehicles to optimally use the resource availability of the network. They
can easily connect to the grid when the demand is low or when renewable energy
is abundant, paving the way for cleaner and more environmentally friendly trans-
portation options.
Intelligent transportation networks, particularly autonomous vehicles that uti-
lize RL and FL, have the potential to influence the optimal scheduling of multi-
energy networks. RL-based autonomous vehicles can learn to make informed deci-
sions regarding energy utilization and charging strategies. By considering factors
such as traffic conditions, energy availability, and user preferences, RL algorithms
enable autonomous vehicles to optimize their energy consumption and charging
patterns, thereby reducing the strain on interconnected energy networks. Further-
more, the integration of FL techniques in autonomous vehicles allows for collab-
orative learning and information sharing among vehicles within the network.
Through FL, autonomous vehicles can collectively analyze real-time data related
to energy availability, traffic conditions, and user behavior. This collective intelli-
gence can inform the optimal scheduling of multi-energy networks by identifying
periods of peak demand, facilitating load balancing, and promoting energy
efficiency.
By leveraging RL and FL, autonomous vehicles can adapt their energy consump-
tion patterns to the energy network conditions and user requirements, leading to
improved energy utilization and reduced reliance on nonrenewable energy
sources. The integration of intelligent transportation networks with multi-energy
systems fosters a symbiotic relationship, where the vehicles benefit from optimized
energy scheduling, and the networks benefit from reduced energy demand and
enhanced sustainability.
In conclusion, the integration of different multi-energy technologies, such as
electricity, hydrogen, and natural gas, in interconnected energy networks paves
the way for sustainable and efficient transportation systems. Autonomous vehicles
using RL and FL techniques have the potential to influence the optimal scheduling
of multi-energy networks by optimizing energy consumption patterns, promoting
load balancing, and fostering collaborative learning. This integration represents a
418
15 Autonomous Vehicle Systems in Intelligent Interconnected Transportation Networks

significant step towards achieving intelligent transportation networks that prior-
itize energy efficiency and sustainability.

Experimental Evaluation of Driving
Personalization Using Federated RL
In our experiments, we employed the Carla simulator,1 a highly realistic driving
simulator that has been extensively used in driving simulation experiments. In
order to mimic the behavior of drivers, we utilized custom functions, drawn from
our prior work [2], which are based on a combination of popular curves (sigmoid
and skewed normal). These functions simulate the changes in a driver’s stress
levels based on various conditions, such as the acceleration, velocity, and angular
velocity of the vehicle, as well as the surrounding conditions (e.g., day or night
driving). By employing these functions, we generate stress profiles for two drivers,
who we assume have very similar behaviors but drive in completely different con-
ditions (i.e., day and night). The profiles differ significantly between day and night
driving, adding a hard challenge for ADAS models that are not trained in both con-
ditions. More specifically, we assume that the drivers choose the sport driving
mode when they drive on a straight road, the normal driving mode when they per-
form a turn during the day, but at night they switch to the normal driving mode on
a straight road and to the conservative profile when they perform a turn. At every
step, the RL model takes an action by considering all the conditions, and this
action results in a new car state (i.e., new velocities and accelerations), which
in turn affects the driver’s stress level. This new stress level is used as the reward
for the action taken. To examine the impact of FL on training time and final per-
formance, we conducted a series of experiments. In our first experiment, we used
the same route in a Carla town and two drivers with similar profiles; we assumed
that the first driver operates only during the day and the second only at night, and
they implemented different training strategies (Figs. 15.4 and 15.5).
First, we trained two separate models (called dedicated models in the follow-
ing), one for each driver. Second, we trained a single model for both drivers (called
mixed model in the following), which is fed by episodes from both drivers (from
day and night driving). We alternate the training episode types (day and night)
every 10 episodes in order to train the mixed model. Finally, we develop an FL
mechanism (called the FL model in the following) that employs two PPO models,
trained separately for each driver, using the specific driving conditions of each. The
model aggregation takes place every 10 episodes, and the federated model is sent
back to each driver for further training.

We train the three alternatives for 200 episodes since after this point no further
improvement in the maximum total reward for each episode is noted. Figures 15.6
and 15.7 show the performance (i.e., total reward per training episode) during the
training phase in these 200 episodes. As we can see, the mixed model is the most

unstable one, since when the model is trained for a task (e.g., driving at night) the
task changes (i.e., day driving samples arrive). There is still an improvement at the
end of the 200 episodes on average. The dedicated models are better in the task
they have been trained on, compared to the federated model, which however
adapts faster to the conditions of both tasks. Especially in the night task, the fed-
erated model quickly achieves a high reward in the first few night episodes.
In the second experiment, we examine the performance of the three training
strategies in new unseen routes with varying conditions. For this purpose, we gen-
erated 100 random routes of sufficient length, comprising an adequate balance
between straights and turns. We tested all three approaches for both day and night
driving. We also tested three strategies that do not personalize the autopilot modes
but simply use the same mode (sport, normal, or conservative). The results are pre-
sented in Figures 15.8 and 15.9. In all cases, we calculate the normalized total
reward for each route, assuming that the maximum reward for a route is subject
to its length. We report the mean values and standard deviation for the six strate-
gies for 100 test routes in day and night driving conditions.
As expected, the evaluation results indicate the superiority of the dedicated
model for the day-driving task. The dedicated model achieved the best perfor-
mance, which is comparable to that of the mixed model, while the FL model fol-
lows. All three models are significantly better than the static autopilot models that
always choose a single driving mode. However, in the night task, the FL model has
a better mean value, but is comparable in performance with the mixed and

dedicated models. The static profiles performed poorly, with the conservative and
sport profiles having the lowest performance in the day and night evaluation.
In order to see how the dedicated models for day and night driving are perform-
ing in any condition, we tested all models in the 200 test episodes (100 in the
day and 100 in night conditions) and display the results in Figure 15.10. The

performance of the static models is low, as expected, whereas the FL and Mixed
models have the best performance. Of course, the mixed model assumes an
increased communication overhead for sharing the episode data from each driver
with the node that trains the common model. The dedicated day and night models
show a medium and very unstable performance, which demonstrates their inabil-
ity to fit well into unseen tasks.
15.6
Discussion
The improved performance, in combination with the better communication over-
head and the privacy it offers, makes the FL technique a perfect candidate for
boosting machine learning models used in ADAS. Especially when models are
trained on the edge and combine the collective knowledge in global models, they
allow the preservation of data privacy, which is particularly important in the con-
text of autonomous vehicles. Another benefit of FL is the scalability and robustness
it offers. The number of edge nodes (i.e., vehicles) can be unlimited, leading to a
new global model that is exposed to a wider range of conditions and environments.
Despite the benefits, there are also some challenges for FL approaches in auton-
omous vehicle systems. They relate to the communication overhead that can be
high under certain conditions (e.g., in frequent model updates), the heterogeneity
of devices, and the quality check of the models shared by the edge nodes. From the
communication aspect, we need a stable and reliable connection utilizing the V2I
or V2X communications in order to have a continuous connection to the cloud,
where an FL aggregator and model validator may reside. The heterogeneity of
devices is another major challenge, as different devices may have different hard-
ware and software configurations, which can make it difficult to ensure that the
edge models learn and behave in the same way when they receive the global
model. Finally, the usage of a cloud-based evaluation mechanism is important
in order to ensure that the new models offer better performance in terms of safety.
The absence of that mechanism can be fatal because models with bad behavior,
either caused intentionally or unintentionally, can infect the global model and
consequently the behavior of all edge nodes (in vehicle models).
Except for the concerns and the problems from the implementation or techno-
logical aspect, we also consider the impact of vehicle automation on various
aspects of human life. This aspect was not a priority in this work, but we believe
that it requires further examination. Key areas of future research must include the
effects on energy consumption, emissions, safety, economic factors, and social
impacts. Long-term effects, potential travel demand changes, and synergistic
effects between vehicle automation, sharing, and electrification require explora-
tion. The coexistence of fully automated vehicles and conventional vehicles in
424
15 Autonomous Vehicle Systems in Intelligent Interconnected Transportation Networks

mixed traffic situations and the potential impacts of cyberattacks on traffic
safety are equally critical research priorities. Additionally, the impact of vehicle
automation on public health and its social implications, including the influence
on vulnerable social groups and the distribution of benefits, require further
examination [74].
The emergence of intelligent interconnected transportation networks presents
an extraordinary opportunity for synergistic collaborations among various com-
ponents of the transportation ecosystem (e.g., the edge nodes in the vehicles
and the cloud nodes on the network backbone), encompassing autonomous
vehicles and smart energy management systems. The fusion of data-driven intel-
ligence, communication technologies, and advanced energy management sys-
tems unlocks a realm of possibilities. It enables dynamic optimization of
energy flow, real-time monitoring of energy availability, and adaptive energy
allocation tailored to the needs of autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, the inte-
gration of renewable energy sources, cutting-edge energy storage solutions, and
smart grid infrastructure within these networks lays the groundwork for sustain-
able and robust autonomous transportation. By harnessing these synergies,
autonomous vehicle energy systems can reap the benefits of refined energy man-
agement strategies, reduced dependence on fossil fuels, and heightened resil-
ience against disruptions, thus propelling the realization of intelligent and
sustainable transportation networks.
Our exploration of utilizing FL for driving personalization carries profound
implications in promoting a Green Economy and advancing the sustainability
of the transportation network. By harnessing the collective intelligence pooled
from multiple autonomous vehicles, our approach facilitates the creation of highly
precise and efficient autonomous driving models. This, in turn, cultivates opti-
mized driving behaviors, leading to reduced energy consumption and a dimin-
ished environmental footprint. Through the continuous refinement of models
in real time, accounting for specific driving conditions and behaviors, we actively
contribute to a more sustainable transportation ecosystem. By embracing the
power of FL, we not only elevate the personalization of autonomous driving
experiences but also foster a future that is greener and more ecologically sound.
Our efforts align harmoniously with global aspirations to curtail carbon emissions
and embrace eco-friendly mobility solutions.

ADAS, reducing training time, and improving performance. Additionally, our
approach improved training stability compared to task-alternating training. The
results also indicate that the usage of RL algorithms is an effective approach for
personalizing ADAS compared to static profiles and can be further optimized
when combined with FL techniques. In addition to our future research plans,
we also intend to incorporate real driver behavior data into our modeling process
to better personalize ADAS. Furthermore, we aim to evaluate the findings of our
study using actual stress and excitement labels from car passengers in varying driv-
ing conditions. This will allow us to validate our results and provide more accurate
and reliable recommendations for improving ADAS. Finally, our future research
aims to explore alternative methods for generating global models with evaluation
and fail-safe mechanisms and also plans to investigate the feasibility of incorpor-
ating FL mechanisms with ICV communication.
