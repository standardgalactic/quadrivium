INTRODUCTION
IT appears to be a fixed law that the contraction of a muscle
shall be toward its centre, therefore, the subject for mechanism
on each occasion
is so to modify the figure, and adjust the
position of the muscle
as to produce the motion
required
agreeably with this law.
This can only be done by giving to
different muscles a diversity of configuration suited to their
several offices and to their situation with respect to the work
which they have to perform. On which account we find them
under a multiplicity of forms and altitudes; sometimes with
double, sometimes with treble tendons; sometimes with none,
sometimes with one tendon to several muscles; at other times
with one muscle to several tendons.
The shape of the organ
is
susceptible of an incalculable variety, while the original
property of the muscle.
The law and line of its contraction
remains the same and is simple.
Herein the muscular system
may be said to bear a perfect resemblance to our works of art.
An artist does not alter the native quality of his materials or
their laws of action. He takes these as he finds them. His skill
and ingenuity are employed in turning them such as they are,
to his account by giving to the parts of his machine a form
and relation in which these unalterable properties may operate

THE TEMPORAL MUSCLE
The mouth was made to cut and grind food.
To save
this trouble and work, mechanical devices such as the mill-
stone were put into operation.
Here the upper stone ground
while the lower was stationary.
In the human machine, the
upper stone
is fixed and the lower does the grinding.
The
only movable bone of the skull is the lower jaw which hinges
to the head just in front of the ear.
It acts as a lever of the
third order.
The cutting and grinding force is controlled by
powerful muscles.
The one that raises the lower jaw is named
l..The
temporal
muscle;
attached
to
the
coronoid
portion of lower jaw it passes upward under the zygomatic
arch covering the temporal fossa.
From its attachment above,
its fibres converge before passing under the arch.

MOVEMENTS OF LOWER JAW

THE MASSETER
The
inferior maxillary or lower jaw bone
is shaped
somewhat like a horse-shoe.
Its front projection forms the
chin;
it then passes backward on either side of the
tmouth
then bends upwards ending in a head or condyle that articu-
lates with the temporal bone.
1
.
. The masseter muscle.
The muscles of mastication
are of marked prominence and
are called massctcrs.
They
move the lower jaw and are inserted into the vertical branch
of the lower jaw-bone; the upper part or the superior border
arises from the zygoxnatic arch.
By its contraction it brings
the teeth together in cutting and grinding.
Unlike the facial
muscles or muscles of expression, the temporal and the mas-
seter extend from the surface of one bone to that of another,
that is, from the unmovable bones of the head to the movable
lower jaw-bone*
In the human species, the mouth not only
is used for
the grinding and breaking down of food, but also the respira-
tion of air and the utterance of sound*

The neck is cylindrical in shape; it follows the curve of
the spinal column. Two curves follow the form of the cylin-
der.
One downward follows the fullness of the neck, and
then turns outward toward the outer third of the collarbone,
and the second curve
encircles
the rounded form from the
back of the neck downward toward the pit in the same man-
ner that a string of beads drop downward,
as they follow
the rounded contour.
The neck
rises
as a column curving
slightly forward even when the head
is thrown well back*
It is rooted at the chest and canopied above by the chin.
It
is somewhat flattened at the back where the back of the head
overhangs. The neck is buttressed on each side by the shoul-
ders.
Behind each ear bands of muscle descend toward the
root of the neck.
These muscles almost meet making a hol-
lowed out point at the pit.

THE HAND CONSTRUCTION
1
.Thumb side, the straight or inaction
side;
2
. Thumb side
is now the action side;
In the hand asjn the human
figure,
there
is an action
and inaction
side.
The
side with
the greater angle
at
t he-
wrist is the action side; the opposite is the inaction or straight
side. The back of the hand, when bent toward the body at
the wrist makes the thumb side the action
side, and the
lit-
tle finger side the inaction or straight side,
Again seeing the
hand from the back and drawn away from
the body,
the
thumb side then becomes the inaction side and the little finger
the angular or action side.
Seen from the palmer side,
the
action and inaction movements are reversed. This can easily
be observed by passing a stick or ruler down the forearm and
bending the hand
till one side or the other lines up straight
with the ruler.
From the thumb side the inaction line ends
at the base of the thumb.

The upper arm bone
the
humerus,
is
the
longest bone of
the upper limb.
It is composed of
a shaft and two extremities.
2.
At
the
lower end
of
the
humerus
there
are two
projec-
tions.
The inner projection
(the
inner condyle)
is quite prominent
and always in evidence and is used
as a point of measurement.
3. The forearm is composed of
two
bones,
the
radius
and
the
ulna.
The
ulna
hinges
at
the
elbow, it articulates with the bone
above by a beak like process and
descends toward
the
little
finger
side of the hand, where
it
is seen
as
a knob
like eminence
at
the
wrist,
4.
The
radius
carries
the
thumb side of the wrist and hand
at
its lower
extremity-
At
the
upper
end,
the head
is hollowed
out
to play
freely on the
radial
head of the humerus.
MUSCLES:

L The pronator
teres. From
its origin on the^ internal condyle
of the humerus
is directed down-
ward and outward and
inserted
into
the
outside
of
the
radius
about half way down 'the shaft
In contraction
it turns
the
fore-
arm and thumb side of the hand
inward causing pronation,
2. There are four flexor musL
cles
that
arise from the internal
condyle
of
the
humerus,
their
bodies are mostly fleshy terminat-
ing
at
their lower half
in long
tendons.
3. The palmaris longus, also a
flexor, shows a long slender ten-
don directed toward the middle of
the wrist.
It
is inserted into the
palmaris
facia
that
stretches
across the palm of the hand.
4.
Flexor

Ill
Muscles must lie above and be-
low the joint they move. Muscles
that bulge
the forearm
in
front
are flexors, they terminate as wires
or
strings
that
pull
the
wrist,
hand and fingers together as they
contract.
IV
The inner condyle of the hum-
erus is a landmark when the fore-
arm is seen from the front and the
bones are
parallel.
In this posi-
tion,
the muscles and
their
ten-
dons
are
directed downward to
the wrist and hand.
The
first,
the pronator
teres,
passes obliquely to the middle of
the! radius* The second, the flexor
carpi,
radiates toward
the outer
side of the hand,
The third, the
palmaris
longus
is
toward
the
middle and the fourth* The flex-
or carpi ulnaris
is toward the in-
ner
border of
the? hand.

Ill
The
muscles
of
the
forearm
are placed just below the elbow,
moving the hand,
the wrist and
fingers by long slijn tendons that
are
securely
strapped
down
as
they pass under or over the wrist.
It
is
a
fixed law
that
a
muscle
contracts
toward
its
center.
Its
quickness and precision of move-
ment depends upon
its length and
bulk.
If the muscles of the fore-
arm had been placed lower down,
the beauty of the arm would have
been destroyed.
IV
The
muscles
that
lie on
the
outer
side and back of
the^ fore-
arm
are known as the supinator
and
the
extensor
group.
They
emerge from between
the
biceps
and the triceps at about a third of
the
distance
up
the
arm
as
a
fleshy mass. These wedge shaped
muscles arc placed on a higher level
than
the
pronator
or
flexor
group, as they arise some distance
above the
outer condyle of the
humerus.
The
extensor
group
take their origin from the condyle
below. The extensor tendons are
on
the back of the arm and
al-
ways point to the outer condyle
of
the humerus.
The
extensor
muscles are the direct antagonists
of
the
pronators and
flexors
in
front.
The
chief
action
of
the
supinator longus is that of a flex-
or but

as
in
supination
as
well

1.. RADIUS
2. .ULNA
The radius
is on
the thumb
side of the hand
at the
wrist.
It operates in a wheel-like motion, This bone is twist-
ed obliquely and moves
circularly around round
the head
of the ulna. The radius
circles around the
little finger side
of the hand in both supination and pronation, making the
head
of the ulna at
the wrist
the axis around which
the
radius follows the rim of a supposed wheel.

The variety, quickness and precision of which the arm
and hand are capable is even at times beyond conception. The
head of the radius turns on its own axis at the radical head,
but does not change
its position next the ulna, due to a ring
of ligament that keeps
it close to a hollowed out surface of
the ulna.
This is called the radial notch.
FOREARM
The mechanical contrivance of the forearm
The forearm
is the lower arm from the elbow to
the
wrist.
It is joined to the bone above at the elbow.
For the
movement of the limb two motions are required. The swing-
ing of the forearm backward and forward and a rotary mo-
tion by which the hand can be turned with the thumb out-
ward or the thumb inward toward the body.
The forearm
consists of two bones that
lie along side each other.
Only
one of these bones
is joined to the upper part of the arm at
the elbow as a hinge joint.
This allows a movement in one
plane,
as
it swings backward and forward,
it
carries along
with
it the other bone and
the whole forearm. When
the
palm of the hand is turned upward, the other bone to which
the hand
is attached,
rolls upon the first.
These two bones
of thefarearm are called the radius and the ulna.
<~The joints are lubricated to make them slip easily one
upon the other.
They are sealed by a capsule and held to-
gether by strong braces to keep them in position.
Strings
and wires, that
is, muscles and
their tendons
are then
in-
serted for the purpose of drawing the bones in the direction
in which the joints allow them to move. The radius alone
carries the hand. The thumb side of the hand when turned
out or in toward the body
is
in the same position
as the
two bones
of
the
forearm.
Parallel when
the thumb
is
is turned out, crossing one another when the thumb is turned
in.
The
radius moves
wheel-like around
the
ulna.
The
forearm
is pivoted or jointed at the elbow which becomes
its fulcrum.
At the end of this lever
is the hand. To flex
the forearm the power
is placed in the arm above and
at-
tached to the forearm below. The muscular power is placed
'
so
close to the hinge-like joint that it lacks in power, but
has the advantage of speecL^ Whatever is lost in strength
is
gained in quickened actioi

PRONATOR SUPINATOR
The two muscular forces that rotate or turn the fore-
arm by crossing one bone over the other, are the supinator
and the pronator*
1
,
, The supinator extends from about a third way up
the bone of the upper arm to the wrist,
ft
is a long muscle.
The lower third
is tendinous.
It
rises above the outer con-
dyle of the humcrus, The upper portion
is the large fleshy
mass that
lies on the outer and upper third of the forearm.
In action
it flexes as well as supinates.
2
,
. The opposing muscle to the supinator
is the short
round
pronator
teres r
which
passes
obliquely
downward
across the forearm.
It arises from the inner condyle of the
humerus to be inserted near the middle of the outer border
of the radius.
These two muscles pull the
radius with
a
wheel-like motion over the ulna and back again carrying the
thumb side of
the hand toward or away from the body.
The supinator is the force that turns the door-knob and the
screw-driver away from the body.
It is the only flexor of the
forearm that can be seen on the surface of
its entire length*

FOREARM
The muscles of the forearm move the wrist, the hand and
fingers.
They
are
muscular
above and
tendinous
below.
These tendons are strapped down to pass over and under the
wrist and fingers.
There
is a great variety of formation and
shape to the muscles of the forearm.
They must be adjusted
to
the
position
they occupy and
yet produce
the motion
required.
In the forearm there are muscles with tendons that are
single and again double as they pass to the wrist and hand.
The muscles of the forearm act separately or in groups with
quickness and precision as the occasion requires.
1. The front and inner side of the forearm
is composed
of muscles that arise from the internal condyle of the humerus
by common tendons and terminate below by tendons that are
two-thirds the length of the muscle.
These tendons separate
to be inserted into the wrist and fingers and are known as
flexors.
2. The muscles of the back and outer side of the forearm
as a group arise from the external condyle and adjacent ridge
of the humerus*
As a mass it is on a higher level than that
of the inner
side of
the forearm.
As to
these muscles
in
general: they pass down the back of the forearm and divide
into tendons as they approach the wrist where they are held
in place by a band called the annular wrist ligament*
3* When the arm is bent to a right angle and the hand is
directed toward the shoulder,
the
flexor muscles
are
set in
motion by contraction.
They swell to their muscular centers
and their tendons pull the hand downward.
When the hand
is bent at the wrist in the direction toward the front of the
forearm,
it is flection.
The reverse is called extension.
4. The extension of the hand on the forearm showing
the muscles and the tendons lying on the outer side and back
of the forearm.
They are held in place by the annular liga-
ment*
The rounded forearm
is made up of the fleshy bodies of
muscle that terminate mostly in long tendons that pass to and
over the wrist and hand.
Some of these muscles move the
hand on the forearm or
the different finger joints on each
other*
There
are
also deep
muscles
of
the
forearm from
which the tendons emerge but the muscles are hidden

BONES:
1. The
coracoid
process
is
a
part of the shoulder blade that ex-
tends beyond and above the rim of
the cup that holds the head of the
arm bone, the humerus*
2. The head of the humerus is
rounded and covered with cartil-
age,
it contacts with the glenoid
cavity of the shoulder blade.
3* The humerus
is one of the
long bones of the body. It is com-
posed of
a
shaft and two
large
extremities;
the upper
articulates
at the shoulder and the lower at
the elbow*
4* The shaft of the humerus at
the elbow
is flattened from front
to back ending in two projections;
one on^the inner, the other on the
outer side, and are called the inner
and
outer
condyles.
The
inner
side is the most prominent.
II
MUSCLES:
L The
coraco-brachialis
is
a
small round muscle placed on the
inner surface of the arm lying next
to the short head of the biceps*
2* The
biceps,
so
called,
be-
cause it is divided into two parts;
the long and the short
The long
head ascends in the bicipital groove
of the humerus to be inserted just
above
the
upper margin
of
the
glenoid
cavity
of
the
shoulder
blade*
The short head has its at-
tachment to the coracoid process*
The biceps descend as a tendon to
the radius below the elbow*
3. The brachialis antfous. mus-
cle
lies
beneath
the
biceps*
It
stretches across the lower half of
the humerus to the ulna*
III
Both the biceps and brachialis
muscles are placed in front of the
arm*
When
they
contract
they
bend the elbow*
Every muscle is
provided with an adversary, as an
example: the finger is not bent or
straightened without the contrac-
tion of two muscles taking place*
The biceps and brachialis anticus
are the
direct antagonists of the
triceps.
The
brachialis
anticus
muscle covers the lower half of the
humerus in front and
is inserted
into the ulna just below the elbow*
Its attachment to
the ulna
is so
short that
it
is at a great disad-
vantage as to power, but what
is
lost in strength
is gained in speed
by its short leverage.
IV
The mass of the shoulder des-
cends as a wedge on the outer sur-
face of
the arm halfway down.
The biceps
is seen
as
a flattened
mass when not in contraction as it
wedges downward
to
enter
the
forearm below the elbow.
There
are great changes in the form of
the arm above the elbow as a mass,
the biceps is lengthened in repose,
but becomes
short and
globular
during contraction*

nent bony point of the shoulder.
Though covered by the deltoid,

4. Common tendon
of d-jg triceps.
The
triceps
muscle
has
been
so named because
it
is composed
of three portions or heads, one of
which
is central and two lateral*
The
long head
arises
from
the
border of the shoulder blade im-
mediately below the glenoid cavi-
ty and terminates in a broad flat
tendon, which is also the termina-
tion of the internal and external
portions* The external head arises
from the upper and outer part of
the humerus.
The inner head
is
also on the humerus, but on the
inner side*
Both muscles are at-
tached
to
the common
tendon,
which
is inserted to the olecranon
process of the ulna.
5. The anconius muscle, small
and triangular in shape is attached
in
the
external
condyle
of
the
humerus above, and below to the
ulna, a continuation of the triceps.
Ill
Muscles
act only by
contrac-
tion.
When exertion ceases they
relax. The muscles that are placed
on the front part of the arm, by
their contraction bend the elbow;
to
extend
and
straighten
the
limb. The triceps,
(the opposing
muscle},
is
brought
into
play
with no less force than that which
bent
it.
The elbow joint
that
these muscles move is a hinge joint
that
moves
in
one
plane
only
either forward or backward.
IV
The back of the arm is covered
by the large muscular forpi of the
triceps, which extends the
entire
length
of
the
humerus.
This
muscle is narrow above, widening
below to the furrow of the outer
head of the
triceps.
From
here
the common tendon of the triceps
follows the humerus as a flatten-
ed plane to the olecranon process
of the ulna. The common tendon
of the triceps receives the muscular
fibres from all three heads of the
triceps.
The
direction
of
this
broad
flat tendon
is in line with
the humerus.

Muscles with their tendons are
the

of
motion
as
much as the wires and strings that
give the movepients to a puppet
In^ the upper arm, the wires that
raise or
lower the
forearm
are
placed in directions which parallel
the bones*
All the muscles of the
body are in opposing pairs. When
a muscle pulls,
the opposing one
yields with
just
sufficient
resis-
tance
to balance the one that
is
pulling.
The forearm is the lever
on which both the biceps and the
triceps flex and straighten out the
arm at the elbow.
The muscles
just mentioned paralled the arm
to swing the
forearm backward
and forward.
Another
contrivance
is needed
to
give
rotary
motion
to
the
thumb side of the hand.
In order
to do
this, the power
is attached
to the lower third of the humerus
above the outer condyle and ex-
tends to near the end of the radius
at the wrist.
It is this muscle that
aids in turning the door-knob and
the screwdriver.
IV
In looking at the arm from the
outer side
it
is seen that the del-
toid descends
as a wedge sinking
into an outer groove of the arm.
The mass of the biceps and triceps
lie on either side. There is as well
an outer wedge, the supinator lon-
gus. These different forms denote
entirely different functions. Mech-
anism has always in view, one of
two purposes;
either to move a
great weight slowly, or a lighter
weight with speed. The wedge at
the shoulder creates power. Lower
down on the arm,
speed.
This
mechanism allows the wrist and
hand
to move up and down
as
well as circularly, with a certain
firmness and flexibility compared
to the camparatively slow motion
of which the asm can be raised.

. INNER VIEW
BONES:
I
1
. The bone of the upper arm
is called the humerus.
It consists
of a long strong cylinder.
As
it
is not flexible,
it can turn only on
joints, one at the shoulder to raise
the arm and one at the elbow to
tend
it*
The
upper
extremity
seen from the inner
side consists
of a round smooth
ball
that
is
covered over by a layer of cartilage
and
is known as the head of the
humerus.
It
glides
in
the
cup
.shaped
cavity
of
the
shoulder
blade, the glenoid cavity.
2. The cylindrical shaft of the
humerus.
3. The
inner
condyle
of
the
liumerus is larger and more prom-
inent than the outer one.
It is the
origin of the flexors of the fore-
arm as well as a muscle that pulls
the thumb
side
of
the
forearm
toward
the
body,
the
pronator
MUSCLES:
II
1.
Coraco-brachialis:
from
coracoid process to humerus, inner
side half way down.
Its action:
it draws forward and rotates the
humerus outward.
2.
Biceps: the long head from
upper
margin
of
the
glenoid
cavity, the short head from cora-
coid process to radius.
Its action:
it
flexes the forearm and
rotates
the radius outward.
3.
Triceps: the middle or long
head;
the external head;
the in-
ternal or short head*
Its action:
it extends the forearm.
4. Brachialis
anticus:
from
front
of
the
humerus
and
the
lower half to the ulna. Its action:
it flexes the forearm.
5.
Pronator radii teres: extends
from the internal condyle to the
radius on the outer side and half-
way down. Its action:
it pronates
the hand and flexes the forearm.
6.
Supinator
longus:
the
ex-
ternal condyloid ridge of the hu
merus to the end of the radius. Its
action is to supinate the forearm.
Ill
The arm and forearm is pivot-
ed or jointed at the elbow.
The
elbow is the fulcrum. The power
that moves the lever is a muscular
engine. When the forearm is rais-
ed
the power
is
exerted by
the
biceps and brachialis anticus, when
this action takes place, the triceps
are inert.
IV
The arm,
seen from the inner
side presents the greatest width at
the
fleshy region of the deltoid,
two thirds of the way from above
the elbow,
then diminishes
as
a
hollow
groove,
bordered by
its
common tendon. The inner view
of the arm, the side that lies next
the body, has a number of muscles
that point this way and that way,
as well as up and down, to pull
and draw the joint in the direc-
tion to which it is attached. The
crossing at different angles braces
the arm
as well
as allows great
freedom of movement.
[41]

ARM AND FOREARM
The arm plays in a socket at the shoulder and swings
on a hinge at the elbow* The rounded head of the arm bone
fits
into the cupped cavity of the shoulder
blade, where a
short,
flexible ligament
is attached
to the head of the ball
and is inserted into the bottom of the cup keeping the two
parts firmly in their place.
Around the edges of both cup
and
ball a membrane
is tied*
This
confines and holds the
bones together* The elbow is surrounded as well by a strong
and firm parchment-like membrane, which keeps the parts
from further action than they are allowed to go in the plane
of their motion*
In all joints, the opposing bones are coated
with cartilage, which by pressure are oiled by the breaking
down of the cartilage itself and
is called the lubricating sys-
tem*
A mechanical contrivance is seen at its best in the fore-
arm for the perfect use of the limb where three movements
are required, a backward and forward,
as well
as, a rotary
motion*
[42]

By comparing the mechanism at the shoulders with the
same at the elbow, it
is seen that there are laws that control
each separate joint. The ball and socket joint at the shoulders
and the tendons and membranes have already been mentioned.
The surrounding ligaments are loose enough to allow a free
motion of flexion and extention. The round ligament, that is
inserted into the head of the humerus and into the cup of
the shoulder blade,
is
also flexible and
still taut enough to
keep the two parts firmly in their places,
The shape of the lower extremity of the humerus gives
the key to the elbow joint.
It is flattened out from front to
the back, and at the sides there are projections.
These pro-
jections. The
inner and
outer
condyles have
pulley -like
grooves around which the upper extremities of the forearm
articulate.
The ligaments which surround the elbow
are stronger
on the sides than front and back, so
that the joint cannot
slip sideways or go further than they ought to in their plane
of motion.
The two bones of the forearm are not on the same level
either above or below. From above, the ulna extends beyond
the head of the radius.
Below, the radius extends beyond the
head of the ulna and
is the only bone of the forearm that
articulates with the hand.

The bone of the upper arm descends diagonally down-
ward from the shoulder to the elbow.
The thigh bone ascends diagonally upward from the
pelvis to the knee.

In the human body, there is a framework of bone. This
framework is called the skeleton.
Muscles move this skeleton.
Both muscles and bones have to be named
the same as the
component parts of any machine issiven a name that
is ex-
pressive of that particular part.
fne muscle that
is placed
in front of the arm has two heads, and
is therefore called,
the biceps. On the back
is a three headed muscle called, the
triceps. The coraco brachialis is named from its origin on a
beak-like process of the shoulder blade.
1
. The biceps bends the elbow and flexes the forearm.
In so doing,
it becomes
thicker and shorter and
is a good
example as to what happens to every muscular engine when
set in motion. The fulcrum or base, from which it exerts
its
power,
is the shoulder blade, where
its two heads
are
at-
tached.
Its tendon below ends in the forearm on the radius
and the forearm
is the lever on which
it acts.
2
.The triceps muscle
is
situated on the back of the
arm.
It extends the
entire length of
the humerus and
is
divided into three parts.
Its outer head occupies the outer
and upper surface of the humerus. The inner head occupies
the inner and lower portion of the bone.
The long head
reaches diagonally in and up to the shoulder blade.
Follow-
ing the bone of the upper arm,
is a flattened space, which
marks
its common
tendon.
This muscle with
its tendon
straightens out the flexed arm and
is the antagonist to thd
biceps.

bent. (Thrmuscles on the front part of the arm by
their

straighten the arm* The lever of the forearm
is pivoted or
jointed at the elbow which acts as its fulcrum* To 'straighten
the arm, the heavy three-headed triceps play against its anta-
gonist, the two-headed biceps* When the exertion of either
of these two muscles cease, they relax to their .former stat
"
The arm consists of a strong cylinder of bone whic
turns on the joint at the shoulder to raise the arm, and an-
other joint at the elbow to bend
it*
These joints are made
to slip on one another and are pulled as they contract or re-
lax, thus changing the surface forms while undergoing action
or relaxation.

MECHANISM OF THE ARM
Engines of the human body not only bend
the body
levers by muscular
force, but
serve as well as brakes, that
allow a slow
reaction.
This
is a gentle relaxation
of the
opposing muscles.
For instance, the biceps and the brachialis
anticus muscles
are placed
in front of the upper arm and
by their contraction, they bend the elbow.
If power ceased
altogether,
it would let the forearm drop down. The same
mechanism of slow motion pertains in all the limbs and in
every movement of the body.

biceps and the brachialis anticus muscles covers the
whole front of the upper arm.
The bone beneath
is named
the humerus,
it
is pivoted or jointed at the elbow to the
forearm. The elbow is its fulcrum. The power that draws
these two portions of the arm toward each other is the brachi-
alis and the biceps. The brachialis
is a broad muscle lying
under the biceps.
It arises from the lower half of the humerus
near the insertion of the deltoid.
Its. fibres terminate on a
thick tendon and is inserted into the coranoid process of the
ulna.
Covering
the brachialis in front,
is
the two headed
biceps.
Its two upper attachments on the shoulder blade are
called the long and short heads. The short head
is attached
to the coracoid process. The long head is attached by a tendon
from the upper margin of
the glenoid cavity.
Both heads
unite about half way down the arm and terminate above the
elbow as a flattened tendon.
Both the biceps and brachialis
anticus bend the elbow and flex the forearm on the arm.
In the upper arm it is easily seen that there is an exact
relation
between
the elbow joint and
the muscles which
move it. The muscular tendons are placed in such a direc-
tion, that by their contraction or relaxation, they
raise the
forearm as well as help in its rotary motion.

It moves backward and forward in one plane only.
Just
below the outer condyle of the humerus is a small and rounded
bursa called the radial head of the humerus.
On the surface
of which rolls the head of the radius.
The large bone, which carries the forearm may be swing-

its hinge at the elbow, at the same time that the
lesser bone which carries the hand may be turning round
it.
Both these bones of the forearm, the radius and ulna, have
prominent ridges and grooves*
They
are directed obliquely
from above, downward and inward. The radius turns round
the ulna in these grooves and on the tubercles at the heads
of both bones.
The lower extremity of the humerus gives a key to the

THE SKELETON
The
movable
articulations
of
the human
body
are
named
after movements
and
structures
that
are
strictly
mechanical.
Machines are instruments interposed between the mov-
ing power and the resistance.
In
the human body
it
is also
power and resistance, both flexible and complicated, made up
of levers and joints such
as, the pivot, the hinge, the ball and
socket,
as
well
as
a
rotating movement,
which would
be
static but for muscular power.
The skull, balanced as it is
on the atlas, makes the skull a lever of the first order.
It
is
balanced like a pair of scales.
The spine or back bone
is a
chain of joints of remarkable construction, firm yet flexible.
The hinge joint moves in one plane only, forward and
backward.
It
is not fashioned in the same way
as a hinge
on a door, but is held together by tendons and ligaments that
hold the corresponding parts close.
In the human machine,
the elbow and the knee are classed as hinge joints. The secur-
ity of a hinge joint depends on
lateral ligaments and the
tendons of the muscles which pass over them.
The ball and socket joint is a
machine-like
structure.
Nothing could be more mechanical.
In the shoulder and the
hip, the globular heads of bone fit into a cup-like cavity. A
flexible ligament is inserted into the head of the ball, and the
other end into the bottom of the cup.
This keeps the two
parts of the joint firmly in their place.
The lower limbs having to support the body,
as well
as,
to allow a great degree of movement, demands a more
solid and a deeper articulation. The rotating movement of
the forearm from the elbow to the wrist is another mechanical
contrivance*
In the human or animal frame, some knowledge of the
bony structure is necessary. To the study of the exact rela-
tion between the bones, their joints and the muscles which
move thejn.
Movable joints should be well understood even
when no motion
is intended or wanted,
to carry the marks
of proportion.
First there is the axial skeleton consisting of
the spine or back bone. The skull and bones of the face are
considered part of the axial skeleton.
The component parts
of the spine,
the thorax and the
pelvis complete the bony
structure.

1. The sternum or breast bone,
the median line of the chest,
2. The thorax or chest
is the
cavity that is enclosed by ribs and
cartilage. The sternum is in front
and the dorsal vertebras is behind.
3. The bodies of the five lum-
bar
vertebrae where most of
the
bending and turning of the trunk
takes place.
4. The
pelvis or pelvic basin.
Consists of the two hip bones and
the sacrum, united by cartilage at
the pubis in front, together with
the sacrum behind.
MUSCLES:

1.
Rectus
abdominus
muscle
forms a long fleshy band on both
sides of a center line of the torso.
It
is quite wide above at the car-
tilages of the fifth, sixth and sev-
enth ribs, tapering downward to
its
narrowest
part, where
it
at-
taches to the pubic sypiphysis of
the pelvis.
It
is not continuous,
but
is crossed by transverse white
lines,
the leania alba.
These in-
tersections vary in number,
but
are usually seen as three sheathed
portions.
2*
Internal oblique is a fibrous
sheathing
that
arises
from
the
lumbar
facia
and
the
crest
of
ilium.
It radiates forward and up-
ward to be attached to the fascia
of the three lower ribs.
3. The external oblique muscle
is
attached
above
to
the
lower
eight ribs, below to the iliac crest
of the pelvis and across by an apo-
neurosis to the abdomen and the
rectus muscle.
Ill
The thorax or
chest
is com-
posed of bones and
cartilages so
as to protect the most vital parts
of
the body,
the heart and
the
lungs.
The thorax protects and
still permits the facility of move-
ment and motion and allows the
act of respiration.
The
ribs
ac-
commodate
themselves
to
the
change of form and not
to
the
change of the
bones,
due to the
elasticity of the
cartilages.
The
thorax or rib cage is cone shaped
with the base below and narrow
above.
Due to
the clavicle and
shoulders,
the upper portion of
the rib cage appears to be broad-
ened out and the actual shape of
the thorax
is
to
a
great extent,
lost to view.
IV
The masses of the torse are: the
chest,
the abdomen and
the pel-
vis, between them, the epigastrium.
The
first two are comparatively
stable, and the middle one is c[uite
movable.
The rectus abdominus,
the internal "and external obliques
all flex the thorax on the pelvis
and have
great influence on
the
surface form.
The digitations of
the external
oblique
are plainly
marked at their origin, from the
ribs as they intermingle with the
serrations of the serratus magnus
above.

THE PLANES OF THE TRUNK
FRONT VIEW
From the front, the masses of the trunk may be divided
into three distinct planes.
First, a line drawn from the inner
third of each collar bone to the base of the breast muscles at
a point to where they take an upward direction to their inser-
tion on the upper arm, thus making a triangular form with
its base on the sixth rib.
Second, the epigastrium forms the
upper part of the abdominal region*
For our purpose,
it is a
flattened plane bordering the breast muscles above and the
stomach below.
The third plane
is more rounded and
is
bounded at the sides by the lower ribs and pelvic bones*
It
is placed in the lower cavity of the trunk and
is called the
abdomen.
These masses of the trunk,
the chest,
the epigastrium
and abdomen are comparatively stable, the middle one mov-
able.
By bending the second finger, when viewed from the
palmer side, these three planes give in miniature the triangular,
the square and the rounded forms of the trunk.

MUSCLES
motion of the human body
is performed by
the
muscles and their tendons^ they are as strictly mechanical as
the wires and ^strings that move a manikin in a puppet show.
Muscular engines reload and discharge automatically. When
compared to the engines of a motor car, the difference is that
combustion takes place, not during the driving stroke, but at
intervals that separate such strokes.
Engines made by man
exert their power by pushing, while the human engines move
by pulling.
Mechanical
force
is rigid while muscqlar force
changes shape with every movement of the body/\JMhiscles
are the fleshy part of the body which surrounds the bones.
These muscles are of fibrous texture and with their tendons
motion is performed*
Each muscle has its purpose,
it draws
or pulls^the part to which it is attached?^
~*'
\JThere
is an exact relation between
the joints and
the
muscles which move the joints. Whatever the joint is capa-
ble of performing,
the muscle
is capable of moving.
All
muscles of the body are set in opposing pairs and in movement
they are balanced to each other. When a muscle is contract-
ing hard,
its opponent yields, yet offers enough resistance to
steady the part being moved/}
LMuscles are formed by bundles of fibres which have the
power of changing their form by contraction, and present a
very different shape when in a state of repose*
Muscles are
named in various ways, sometimes from the region they oc-
cupy or from their direction or
their size or shape or as to
their mechanical
actions.
Some
of the simple movements
are easily understood, such as, those that cover the cylindrical
bones of the arm and thigh where the muscles parallel the
bone, which by contraction give a hinge-like motion to both
elbow and knee* At the shoulder and hip joints, the ball and
socket allows a rotary movement of the limbs to which the
different directions of the muscles correspond?^
\Muscles are the fleshy part of the body.
They, with
theirSfendons are the instruments, by which animal motion
is performed.
Besides the muscles just mentioned that move
the hinged joints and those that give a rotary motion, there
are the muscles that are given an oblique direction as -well as
those that run diagonally across a limb.
These are, the sar-
torius and the tibialis muscles of the thigh and the leg*
Tl^ese
different muscles act by contraction and in no other way*;

. The deltoid muscle resembles a delta in shape*
It
arises from the outer third of the clavicle and the convex bor-
der of the acromion and runs the entire length of the spine
of the shoulder blade.
All three portions are directed down-
ward. The middle portion is vertical and the inner and outer
descend obliquely, to be inserted by a short tendon into the
outer surface of the humerus.
Nature allows these three por-
tions to work in harmony. The deltoid, when all three por-
tions are working, pull the arm up vertically. The portions
that pull diagonally from the collar bone, and from the crest
of the shoulder blade, carry
it forwards and backwards.

The pectoralis major muscle twists upon itself when
the arm is down. When the arm is extended or raised above
the head,
its fibres are parallel.

SHOULDER GIRDLE
Shoulder blades
are embedded rather than attached to
the back.
They move from their atachment at the summit
of the blade to the collar bone and are
raised,
lowered, or
twisted by muscular
force.
The movements
of the collar
bones and the shoulder blades are free except where the col-
lar bone joins the sternum in front* These bones curve around
the cone shaped thorax, and are known as the thoratic girdle.
This girdle, except at its attachment at the sternum, may be
raised or lowered;
thrown
forward or twisted round
the
static rib cage without interfering in any way with the act
of expiration or inspiration.
There
is a space between the
borders of the shoulder blades at the back and in front and
between the two ends of the collar bones*
The muscular
power that raises the shoulders away from the rib cage when
set in motion, work against each other with perfect balance.

They are
worked by two muscular engines, one that raises and expands
the chest and the one that pulls the cage down* These oppos-
ing muscles are known as elevators and depressors*
The enlargement and contraction of the chest depends
on the mechanical contrivance of the bones which enclose
it*
The ribs articulate to the sides of the backbone from where
they
project obliquely downward.
When they
are pulled
upward,
they are
at the same time being pulled outward*
which brings them more to a right angle to the spine, causing
the sternum or breast bone to which they are attached at the
front, to be thrust forward. The muscular bands that en-
large and contract the chest pass upward obliquely from pel-
vis to the front and sides of the rib cage.

MECHANISM OF THE TRUNK AND HIPS
The cage and the pelvic bones are connected by a portion
of the spine called the lumbar region.
Muscular power act on
these masses as levers and allow the body to move forwards
and backwards or turn.
The pelvis can be compared to a
wheel with only two spokes, the hub is the hip joint and the
spokes are the legs which swing back and forth as in walking
or running.
When force is applied to the long end of a lever,
the power
is increased.
When speed
is desired, the lever
is
shortened.
The muscular power of the human body can only pull
upon and bend the levers at the joints, when the masses of
the back and pelvis are bent backward or forward, or to the
side. The movement of the back is limited to the extent that
the bony structure of the spine allows.
Each segment of the
spine is a lever, upon which the masses of the rib cage and
the pelvis bend or turn. From the rear, the torse presents a
great wedge with its apex directed downward* The base of
the wedge is at the shoulders*
This wedge
is driven in be-
tween the two
buttresses of the hips.
In movement these
two masses turn or bend.

DEEP MUSCLES OF THE BACK
T /
On each side of the spine there are bundles of muscles
and tendons that arise from
the
latter portion of the
iliac
bones and the sacrum* They pass upwards by slips and fibres
to the ribs and cervical vertebrae.
Muscular fibres fan out-
ward and upward to some of the lower
ribs.
They come
from the last dorsal and lumbar vertebrae.

. The deep muscular layers of the back are the erectors of
the spine.

.
. The posterior muscles fan outward toward the sides of
the ribs.

.
. The trapezius and the latissimus dorsi muscles form
by themselves the superficial layer of the back. A trapezium
is a geometrical figure having four
sides.
In shape
it resem-
bles an elongated diamond*
Four points mark the extreme
borders. Above it is inserted into the inner third of the curv-
ed line of the occipital bone at the back of the skull, and to
the spinous process of the seventh
cervical vertebrae*
The
next point of the diamond is the spinous process of the twelfth
dorsal vertebrae which marks
its
base*
All these insertions
correspond to the middle line of the back. Above and at the
base of the skull the trapezius is carried outward and oblique-
ly downward toward
the shoulders
to be attached
to
the
spine of the shoulder blade at the back and to the outer third
of the collar bone in front. The points of the elongated dia-
mond shaped trapezius

.
. The latissimus muscle extends from the region of
the loins to the upper part of the arm.
It arises from a broad
triangular aponeurosis. An aponeurosis
is a fibrous expan-
sion of the tendon giving attachment to muscular fibres. This
lamina of the latissimus dorsi
arises from the fifth or sixth
dorsal. To

The mass of the torso from the rear, presents a great
wedge,
{its apex downward).
It shows many depressions
and prominences.
This
is due to the bony structure and to
the layers of muscle that cross and recross the back*
From
the shoulder blade above, both ridge and blade
are seen
as
grooves or ridges under the skin.
These are looked upon as
landmarks and must be recognized as such.
These serrations
and grooves must be traced and catalogued. The deltoid can
be traced below and outside the crest of the shoulder blade;
the trapezius above the crest and inside toward the seventh
cervicle.
This muscle also spreads from the inner end of the
ridge to well down
the spine.
Lower down, the latissimus
dorsi covers the back.
Lying under these two sheets of su-
perficial muscle are the muscles that control the movements
of the shoulder blades.
There is first, the levator angula sca-
pulae.
This muscle
is inserted into the upper border of the
shoulder blade.
It draws the blade upward in an almost ver-
tical direction toward the upper vertebrae of the neck.
The
rhomboides muscle
is inserted into the base of the scapulae,
it takes a diagonal direction upward to the five upper dorsal
and
the seventh
cervicle.
The serratus magnus muscle
lies
between
the shoulder blade and the
ribs.
It draws the in-
ferior angle of the blade downward and forward.
The muscles that move the shoulder blade:
1
Levator anguli scapulae,
raises the angle of the shoulder
blade.
2
Rhomboideus major and minor, elevates and retracts the
shoulder blade.
3
Serratus magnus, draws the shoulder blade forward.

3. The spine is a ridge running
obliquely upward

MUSCLES.
II
L The supra-spinatus muscle:
occupies
the upper
fossa of
the
shoulder blade to be inserted into
the upper part of the great tuber-
osity of the humerus.
2. The
infra-spinatus:
this
muscle
occupies
the
greater
part
of
the
fossa
that
lies below
the
spine
of
the
scapula.
It
arises
from
the
back
of
the
shoulder
blade to be inserted into the large
tuberosity of the humerus.
3.
Teres minor muscle:
arises
from the auxiliary border of the
shoulder blade to be inserted into
the humerus
just below
the
in-
sertion of the infra-spinatus.
4.
Teres major
muscle:
has
its origin at the lower angle of the
shoulder
blade.
It
is
a round,
thick muscle that ascends upward
and outward
to be inserted into
the humerus
at
its
inner surface
near the bicipital groove.
Ill
The
three
muscles,
the
infra-
spinatus,
teres
minor
and
teres
major,
are seen superficially in a
triangular
space that
is bounded
by the trapezius, deltoid and latis-
simus dorsi.
If the arm is raised,
the
triangle becomes
lengthened.
If drawn back toward the spine,
the triangle becomes shorter as
it
closes up.
(^When
the arm
is hanging be-
side
the
trunk,
this
triangular
shape becomes more visible.
The
only
articulation
the
shoulder
blades
have
with
the
cage
is
through
the collar bones,
as this
bony
girdle moves,
the shoulder
moves.}
IV
The inner or vertical borders of
the shoulder blades move forward
or backward, due to
the raising
or lowering of the arms; the rom-
boid muscles swell but as they ap-
proach
the
spinal
column,
or
show
as
shallow
depressions
when
in
reverse.
The shoulder
blade slides against the surface of
the cage in any direction, and may
be lifted from it, so that, its lower
angle or
its
spinal edge becomes
prominent under the skin.

THE SCAPULA
In treating the shoulder as a mechanical device, onejries
to discover
its function,
its leverage and
its power. ([HThe
shoulder must be looked upon as the foundation of the arm/])
The large diagram on the opposite page shows the^mus-
cular arrangement of the shoulder blade. The arm
is separa-
ted at a distance from the shoulder, showing the devices which
nature has contrived
in order that the arm may be pulled
forward, inward or back. The origin of all the muscles shown
are on the shoulder blade, while the insertions on the arm
are on both the top, front and back of the humerus.
They
are so placed, that when pulling against one another,
their
contracting fibres cause a rotary movement of the arm; These
muscles entirely or in part are seen only
in the triangular
space bound by the trapezius, latissimus dorsi and the deltoid.

The pelvis consists of two hip
bones and a sacrum.
1. The ilium or hip bone con-
sists
of two
upper
blades:
the
superficial
parts
are
the
crests,
(the
iliac crests).
2. The sacrum
is the keystone
of
the
pelvis.
This
is
a wedge
shaped bone that forms the cen-
tral piece at the back, the last por-
tion of which is called the coccyx.
3. The acetabulum
is the soc-
ket of the hip joint;
it forms the
central point of the shaft of the
femur.
4.
Great trochanter.
5.
Pubis.
MUSCLES:
II
1. The
external oblique mus-
cle: from the lower eight ribs and
attached to the iliac crest.
2. The
gluteus medius:
arises
from
the
iliac
crest and
part
of
the outer surface of the ilium. Its
descending
fibres
converge
to-
ward
the great trochanter of the
femur
into
which
they
are
in-
serted by heavy tendons.
3. The gluteus maximus:
the
largest and thickest muscle of the
body
is
directed
obliquely from
the sacrum and
the
iliac
region
toward
the
upper
part
of
the
femur to which it
is attached by
broad
fleshy fibres.
4. The tensor femoris muscle,
lies next the gluteus medius.
It
arises from the crest of the ilium.
It is directed downward and back-
ward on
the external
surface of
the thigh to be
inserted into the
aponeurosis of the facia lata. The
fibres of
the
tensor
femoris
des-
cend on the external surface of the
thigh to the knee.

Ill
The weight of the body is sup-
ported on the ball shaped head of
the femur which
is fitted into the
socket of the hip bone or pelvis.
The body
is poised on
the head
of
this
thigh
bone.
The
shaft
serves
as
a crank on
which
the
muscles round the pelvis act. First
the
gluteus medius abducts and
rotates and turns out the
thigh.
The
tensor
femoris
tenses
the
facia
and
rotates
the
thigh
in-
ward.
IV
From the iliac crest, the gluteus
medius forms
a
descending
wedge;
its front portion over laid
by the tensor.
The whole of the
gluteus
maximus
muscle
passes
down and forward to below the
great trochanter of the thigh bone
completeing the mass of the but-
tocks and hips.
The
iliac
crest
is the fulcrum
for the
lateral muscles,
it
flares
out widely for that purpose,
the
ilio-tibial band
guards
the
out-
side of the thigh becoming more
narrow
and cord
like
as
it
ap-
proaches
the
outer
side
of
the
knee.

Nature has provided a perfect system of columns, levers
and pullies to which cords and muscles are attached. When
contraction takes place, these muscles and their tendons pull,
twist or turn, the movable bones. The hip joint is a strictly
machine-like contrivance.
It has at its connection with the
hip, a ball and socket joint and a hinge joint at the knee.
The muscles at the hip give a wheel-like movement*
Those
muscles that pass to the knee parallel the thigh bones to bend
the knee*

In the human body there is a framework of bone. This
framework is called the skeleton.
Muscles move this skeleton.
Bones are classified as long, short and irregular. Muscles
are
also
classified
as
to
length,
size,
shape,
etc.
Muscles
are placed over this framework, to work
its various levers,
cranks and hinge-like movements.
They control the move-
ments of the trunk as well as the limbs, to swing the lower
limbs as in taking a step forward. The muscular engines of
the buttocks act upon the hip joint and the thigh. The ex-
tensors in front extend the leg. The hamstrings at the back
to move the leg at the knee. Those at the calf raise the heel
and thrust the foot forward.
To keep the body erect, the center of gravity must be
continually shifting.
It is an adjustment of weight, pressure
and quick balancing.

The muscles that are visible are
all situated at the back
to
form the gluteal region.
Only two of these are prominent;
they are, the gluteus maximus and the gluteus medius. With
the pelvis as a base, these two act on the femur, which acts
as a crank shaft. The upper end of the femur is in the shape
of a bent lever on which the whole body rests.

BUTTOCKS AXD HIP


LUBRICATING SYSTEM
The human body
is provided with a system of levers,
pullies and cords by which muscles pull on the movable bones.
m The union of two bones that permit action is known as
a
joint* The ends of these bones where they come in con-
tact with each,
are tipped with
cartilage.
This
cartilage
is
elastic, taking up the jar which would result if the bones came
directly together in contact. The surface of the articulating
cartilage
is
perfectly smooth*
This surface resembles
cello-
phane and
is lubricated with a fluid that
is attained by the
actual breaking down of the cartilage itself.
It is recognized that no machine has ever been built that
maintains a uniform oiling device that equals the lubricating
system of the human body.
All joints are completely enclosed by a
capsule, which
is loose enough to allow the
free movement of
the
levers
within the capsule.
There are no empty spaces nor apertures
for draining that will allow the lubricant to escape. A limb
can swing on its hinge or in its socket many times a day for
many years without losing its agility.
Provision is made for
preventing wear and
tear.
First by the polish of the
carti-
laginous surfaces.
Second by the healing
properties of the
lubricating oil, and the way substance
is restored and waste
repaired,
1
.At the hip where the ball and socket joint allows
by its construction a rotary or sweeping motion, tendons and
muscle pull in such directions as to produce the motion which
the joint admits.
Here the wires and strings, which conduct
the muscular power, pull the thighs together, in both rota-
tion and adduction*
2
. .The oil of the oiling system is supplied ^by the rub-
bing together the two plates of cartilage at the joint.
3
.
. It is then capsuled and bound by strong dense liga-
ments which embrace the jnargin of the cup,
(the acetabu-
lum), above and surrounding the neck of the femur below.
4. .If
the joints were not lubricated, they would be
stiff and creak like a hinge without oil.
Membrane stretches
from bone to bone confining the fluid, which is not dropped
as pictured here, but actually made.

The thigh bone
is the most perfect of all
levers,
it
is
balanced by the muscles that pass up from thef "crank shaft*',
of the thigh bone to the pelvis.
These muscles work against
one another in turning the round slippery head of the thigh
bone in the socket. The muscles parallel the shaft to control
the action of the knee joint, the extensors of the leg are in
front or on top when the thigh is drawn upward, while those
that flex the leg on the thigh are at the back.
i
The sartorius arises from the crest of.the ilium, it sweeps
downward in a sinous curve across the thigh, in a flattened
tendon as it wraps around the inner surface of the knee to its
insertion on the tibia.

L The semi-tendinosus muscle
arises from the tuberosity of the

is
inserted
into the
upper part of the inner surface of
the

It
is seen as an inner
hamstring.
2. The
biceps
femoris
is
the
outer
hamstring
and
has
two
heads, one of which is long, and
the other one
short*
The long
head
descends
from
the
pelvis
above,
the
short head
descends
from the back of the femur. A
common tendon of the two por-
tions
is inserted into the head of
the fibula on the outer side of the
knee.
3. The semi-membranosus one
of
the hamstrings of the knee
is
located at the back of the thigh.
Above,
it
arises at the tuberosity
of the ischium*
Below, it is insert-
ed to the back of the inner tuber-
osity of
the

Above
it
is
fibrous but becomes more muscul-
ar on

Ill
The muscles of the thigh from
the back are three in number. They
emerge from beneath the gluteus
maximus
and
are
seen
as
two
rounded masses descending vertic-
ally.
The outer mass
is formed
by a single muscle, the biceps. The
inner
mass
is
formed
by
two
muscles, one on
the top
of the
other; the semi-tendinosus on top,
the semi-membranosus beneath.
The back of the knee when bent
presents a hollow due to the ham-
strings on either side.
It is border-
ed above by the semi-membrano-
sus and below by the tendons and
the muscles of the calf of the leg.
The
diamond
shaped
cavity
is
named
the popetial
space.
The
knee and ankle are in
line.
The
shaft of the thigh bone above
is
set at an angle with the leg mak-
ing the inside of the knee protrude.
When the thigh and leg
are not
bent, the joints back of the knee
become more prominent and the
hamstrings are less in evidence.
IV
When
the
thigh
bone moves
upward,
it acts as a crank on the
pelvis.
The
muscles
swell and
thicken
as they pass back of the
femur.
These hamstring muscles
have
their
origin on
the
pelvis,
their tendons clasp the leg on either
side just below the knee giving a
hinge like motion in bending the
leg on the thigh.

1. The thigh bone, the femur,
articulates with the leg bone, (the
tibia
at the knee) .
2.
There is an internal and ex-
ternal tuberosity on each side of
the thigh bone at the knee.
The
inner
is the most prominent*
3. The patella
is a small disk
of bone that plays the part of a
pulley in front of the lower end
of the femur,
called the kneecap.
4. The leg
like the forearm
is
composed of two bones. The larg-
er of the two
is the
tibia.
5. The
fibula
is
flute
like
in
length and thickness.
It is placed
on the outer side of the tibia.
MUSCLES:
II
Three surface muscles make up
the extensors
of the
leg.
They
are united by a tendon to the pa-
tella, then continue to the tibia by
a ligament.
These muscles end a
short
distance
above
the
knee,
forming
three
divisions
as
they
join the common tendon.
1
. The rectus muscle at its low-
er margin joins the common ten-
don quite high above the knee.
2. The vastus externus occupies
the outer side of the thigh above
the knee.
There its fibres pass by
a
flat tendon
into
this
compion
tendon that goes to the patella.
3. The vastus internus termin-
ates
as a mass lower down
than
either of the preceeding muscles. It
is inserted by a tendon to the pa-
tella on the inner side of the knee.
Ill
The bones
of the knee move
backward and forward in the same
plane for which a hinge joint
is
sufficient.
Bands of tendons and
ligaments
tie
the two
shafts
to-
gether. The powerful tendons that
move the
leg forward,
pass into
and around
the patella that
acts
as a pulley to their insertion by a
ligament into the tubercle of the
tibia.
IV
The masses of the knee must
be thought of as a square or key-
stone in shape. The sides of which
are
beveled
forward.
All
three
muscular divisions above the knee
are of different heights due to their
lengths of tendon as they approach
the kneecap, and are used as a land-
mark to locate the
patella.
When the weight of the body
rests upon the knee there is a bulge
on either side of the ligament that
passes from the kneecap to the leg.
This bursa
or water mattress
is
part of the lubricating system of
the knee.

2. The termination of the great
muscles
of the thigh pass round
the knee
to be inserted into the
inner and outer sides of the leg. On
the outer side,
the tendon of the
biceps femoris attaches to the head
of the fibula with an expansion
of the tendon to the tibia.
3. The semi-mejtnbranosus de-
scends from the pelvis to the back

The fleshy part of the muscle de-
scend
to

the
other two hamstring muscles.
4. When the leg is straight, the
bones of the thigh and the leg at
the back of the knee are seen on
the surface. When the leg is bent,
it
is hollowed out.
This depres-
sion
is termed, the popliteal space.
5. The gastrocnemius:
(see leg.)
Ill
The
leg has
its motion at the
knee.
In
standing,
the
whole
weight of the body presses on the
tuberosities
of
the
thigh
bones,
which articulate with those of the
leg.
As the muscles contract, the
leg
is drawn up and flexed upon
the thigh.
As the muscles of the
arm pull the forearm toward the
shoulder, so the hamstrings of the
thigh pull the leg upward toward
the thigh.
IV
The muscular parts of the thigh
above, are well rounded. As they
descend toward the knee, they be-
come
tendinous,
the bony mass
showing

Both
the
hamstrings,
the

The so called hinge joint at
the knee is held together by strong
ligaments that cross each other in
such
a manner
as
to
secure
the
joint from any great side strain.
It
is
also held
in
place by two
other ligaments. These
are called
the
lateral
ligaments.
There
is
one on either
side.
To keep the
joint secure, there is also a parch-
ment
like membrane
that
is
in-
serted
round
the
bones
of
the
knee. A little way above and be-
low the knee joint, this membrane
ties and
holds
the

is
flexible enough
to allow the thigh and leg ample
movement in the one plane.

The knee consists of bone and
tendons.
The muscles
lie above

1. The
vastus
internus
is
at-
tached to the patella by a tendon.
Its
lower
margin
sweeps
round
the
inner
side
of the knee
as
a
bulky .mass of muscle. Its attach-
ment to the common
tendon
is
near
vertical.
The lower border
is directed horizontally inward to
about half way on the patella.
2. The sartorius
is the longest
muscle in the human body,
aris-
ing from above at the iliac spine
of
the
pelvis.
It
descends
obli-
quely toward
the
inside
of
the
knee to be inserted to the upper
and internal
surface of the
tibia.
3. The
gracilis
descends from
the pelvis to the tibia. It is placed
on
the
inner
side
of the
thigh,
where
it passes round the
inner
side of the femur and follows the
same curve as the sartorius at the
knee to be inserted into the inner
and upper surface of the tibia.
4. The semi-tendinosus
arises
from the latter part of the pelvis.
It
then
passes
round
the
inner
side of the femur and follows the
same
curve
as
the
sartorius and
gracilis at the knee to be inserted
into the inner and upper surface
of the
tibia*
III
The
sartorius
flexes,
abducts
and rotates the thigh inwards. The
semi-tendinosus and gracilis both
flex and abduct the leg and helps
rotate it inwards.
IV
The knee, from the front, the
back,
or from
the
side must be
envisioned
as
a
square
form
slightly
more
narrow
in
front
than at the back.
The inner side
of the knee is larger than the outer
side.
The patella
is on a
level
with the upper border of the tibia.
The vastus internus terminates by
a
tendon a
little above halfway
up the patella*
The inner ham-
strings and the sartorius are fixed
points to watch out
for*
The
only surface form that
differs in
different knees, is due to the lubri-
cating system, that surrounds the

Off center.
There are no dead centers in the mechanism of the hu-

All levers are set in such a way that a fly wheel
is not necessary to carry the momentum over a dead

MECHANISM OF THE KNEE
The patella or knee pan in form,
is unlike any other
bone in the body.
It
lies upon
the front of the knee.
By
powerful tendons
that pass into and around
it,
the
leg
is
brought forward. The patella protects both the tendon and
the joint from injury and
acts as a pulley in straightening
out the limb.
It is a part of the powerful tendons by which
the leg is brought forward from their origin in the thigh to
their insertion in
the
leg.
The patella protects the tendon
and the knee joint.
It also gives these tendons a great me-
chanical advantage by altering the line of their direction, by
advancing them further out from the center of motion. Many
forms of machinery are rigged in the same way.

1.
The!
tibialis
anticus
arises
from the outer surface of the tibia.
It descends obliquely as
a fleshy

it
is
replaced by
a long tendon,
which
after passing beneath
the

Half way down the
leg
they continue
as a tendon which
passes round the outer ankle and
cross to the outer border of the
foot which they help to extend.
3. The
extensor
longus
digi-

Ill
All muscles

join
the tendon of the heel
be-

2. The muscles at the back of
the
leg,
by connection with the
achilles tendon raise the heel- The
bulk of the calf of the leg is made
up of twin
piuscles, named
the
gastrocnemius

the
condyles*
The
soleus
arises from both the

are
inserted
into the tendon achilles and con-
tinued to the heel.
3. The achilles tendon is broad
above where it receives the muscles
of the calf of the leg.
It then tap-
ers as it descends toward the heel.
4. The
soleus
lies
under
the
gastrocnemius.
It arises from the
back
of both
the
tibia and
the

Lower down
it joins the
achilles tendon.
It is seen on both
sides of the calf of the leg.
Ill
Motion is performed by muscles
and their tendons.
To draw the
heel up and drop the front part
of the foot, the muscular engines
are
represented
by
the
gastroc-
nemius and the soleus.
The long
tendon of the achilles is the piston
cord and the heel the crank pin.
As the heel rises, the muscles short-
en and gain power. To raise the
heel,
the muscles at
the back of
the leg go into reverse action. The
muscles that lie in front of the leg
are then brought into play*

The
leg
at
the
calf
becomes
prominent
as
an
ovoid
fleshy
body.
The
external portion of
the
calf of the
leg
is usually
a
little higher than
the inner por-
tion. From here the flattened ten-
don
descends to
the
heel.
The
soleus
is seen as a ridge on either
side of the calf.
Its tendon is even
more prominent when the leg
is
under tension*

LEG. ..INNER VIEW
BONES:
I
1. The
internal
tuberosity
of
the femur.
2. The
internal
tuberosity
of
the tibia*
3. The tibia or shin bone.
4. The malleolus
internus
or
inner ankle.
MUSCLES:
II
1. Wrapping round the intern-
al tuberosity of the femur and the
tuberosity
of
the
tibia,
are
the
tendons
of
the
inner hamstring
muscles.
These muscles have their
origin on the pelvic bone and are
inserted into the inner surface of
the tibia just below the knee*
2. The
gastrocnemius
muscle
arises from two heads just above
the condyles of the femur and ends
below to join
the broad tendon
of the tendo achilles and is known
as the calf of the leg.
3. The
soleus
is
a broad
flat
muscle that
arises from the back
of the tibia and fibula and joins
the tendons of the gastrocnemius.
It
is
inserted below by
fibres
in
to the
achilles tendon,
thence
to
the oscalcis or heel bone*
4. The
achilles tendon.
Ill
The calf of the leg is made up
by the mass
of the two muscles
above mentioned.
The principal
onet the gastrocnemius,
is divided
at
its
attachment
above
to
the
f$mur. It widens out as it descends
into a single muscle where it joins
the achilles tendon. At this point,
the external
side of the
gastroc-
nemius
is a
little higher than the
internal side. The flat soleus that
underlies
the
gastrocnemius pro-
jects on each side of
the calf of
the leg. These lateral ridges become
more prominent when the heel
is
raised.
The hamstrings bend the
knee,
the
calf muscles and
their
tendons extend the foot. The heel
is the crank pin on which
these
muscles act to bring the foot in a
straight line with the leg.
The
triceps
of
the femur
in
front and the hamstrings behind
have their attachments below the
knee. The first group straightens
the
leg,
while
the
second group
bends the leg. The gastrocnemius
and soleus by their attachment to
the tendon of
the
achilles,
pulls
the heel up.
As the heel is raised,
it becomes more horizontal
and
nearer a right angle to the tendon,
thus giving a greater leverage and
more power to the foot.
IV
The inside of the leg at the knee
is
larger
than
the
external
side.
The femur and the tibia protrude
vand
as
a
whole
bends
convex
toward
its fellow.
The shaft of
the thigh bone is carried some dis-
tance out by a long neck so that
the thigh
is set at an angle with
the leg.

(patella).
3. The head of the fibula.
4. The

MUSCLES:
II
1. The biceps femoris muscle is
inserted
to
the outer
side of the
knee by a tendon that
is attached
to the head of the fibula.
2.
Peroneus longus, from the
shaft of the fibula, terminating in
a long tendon that passes down
the outer surface of the leg to the
outer

where
it
joins
the
peroneus
brevis,
to
be
inserted
into the outer border of the foot.
3. The
tibialis
anticus
arises
from the outer surface of the tibia
near
the
outer
tuberosity*
Its
fleshy
portion
extends from
above:, to about the lower third of
the
leg passing from
there
as
a
tendon through the annular liga-
ment to be inserted into the base
of the big toe.
4. The gastrocnemius, known
as the calf of the leg.
5.
The'
extensor
'of the
toes,
(the
longus
digitorum),
arises
from both tibia and fibula.
^ The
tendons of this muscle are divided
into four
divisions
after passing
Under a ligament at the ankle, to
be
inserted
into
the
four
outer
toes.
Ill
The
thigh
bone
and
the
leg
bone at the knee (acts as a hinge) ,
and
is
the
largest
joint
in
the
body.
*Its security and strength
depends on
the
lateral ligaments
and the tendons of those muscles
which pass over
it. A membrane
also ties and confines the ends of
the bones
together,
keeping
the
parts of the joint in close applica-
tion to each other.
When standing
erect,
the ten-
dons and
ligaments at the front
of the knee are not under tension,
the knee cap
is not fixed
under
these conditions, but quite loose.
All the muscles and tendons below
the knee move the foot. The gas-
trocnemius and soleus act on the
foot
raising the
heel,
while
the
tibialis
and
peroneus
turns' or
rotates the foot at the ankle joint.
IV
The outer view of
the thigh
sinks in at the knee giving a con-
cave
curvature
from
the
mass
above.
Below,
the
leg
curves
downward and outward
to
the
curve of the calf.
The tibia and
fibula are seen as flattened planes
front and side.

THE KNEE AND LEG
1
.
. The
tibialis anticus is a rounded muscle that arises
from the tibia just below the knee.
It passes down the outer
side of the shin bone.
Below
its tendon passes through a
band
at
the
ankle,
the
annular
ligament,
and
is
inserted
into
the base of the great
toe.
Its
lateral movement turns
and elevates the inner border of the foot*
2
.
. Viewed from
the
side,
the tendinous portion of
the gastrocnemius
is seen gripping
the shaft of the femur
just above the condyles.
The soleus arises from the back of
the tibia and fibula then passes backward to join that of the
gastrocnemius; both are inserted into the heel bone by the
tendon achilles.
3
.
. The inner portion of
the gastrocnemius where
it
joins^ the achilles tendon,
is set at a lower level than the outer
division. The soleus shows on both sides of the calf beyond
the inner and outer margins of the gastrocnemius.
4
.
. The soleus is a broad flat muscle, shaped like a sole
fish*
It arises from back of the tibia and fibula. The lower
part joins the tendon of the achilles.
5
.
. The leg
(see figure 5 ) shows the arrangement of
muscles in rotation, seen from the fibular side.
First the gas-
trocnemius.
Second, the soleus*
Third, the peroneus longus
and brevis, and the tibialis anticus. The extensors of the toes
are more to the front.
The upper end of the calf of the leg is fixed firjnly to
the lower end of the thigh bone just above the condyles of
the femur, while the soleus which
lies
directly beneath,
is
fastened to the back of the leg bones,
(the tibia and fibula)
.
The two are connected by a strong tendon to the heel
bone. This tendon acts as a connecting rod to the heel which
may be likened to a crank pin on which the muscles at the
back of the leg
raise the heel and presses the front part of
the
1 foot to the ground.
Then the muscles that are placed
on the front of the leg come into action.
These muscles are
furnished with long tendons that pass from the foot to the
toes.
These tendons do not have the power of the jnuscles
that raise the heel, but act as a break in easing the front part
of the foot to the ground as well as raising the toes.

THE FOOT
The bones of the foot are Arched.
At their summit
is
a keystone upon which
the weight of the body
is poised.
The two bones
of the leg
are
called the
tibia and
fibula.
Between the extremities of these two bones,
articulates the
astragulus. When the foot is raised, as in stepping forward,
it rolls easily on the arch that is placed between the two bones
of the
leg.
These extremities are known
as the inner and
outer ankles.
When the foot
is
flat or planted, and the body
is car-
ried forward, the joint of the leg and foot become a fixed
and
steady base
to
rest upon.
In walking,
the
^ heel
first
touches the ground and the foot descends in a semicircle, the
center of which
is the heel.
of
The arch of the foot
which not only permits motion, but allows great
elasticity.
The arch of the foot has requisite strength to support the
weight of the body as well as additional burden.
