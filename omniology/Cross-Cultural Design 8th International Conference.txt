Foreword
The 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCI International
2016, was held in Toronto, Canada, during July 17–22, 2016. The event incorporated
the 15 conferences/thematic areas listed on the following page.
A total of 4,354 individuals from academia, research institutes, industry, and gov-
ernmental agencies from 74 countries submitted contributions, and 1,287 papers and
186 posters have been included in the proceedings. These papers address the latest
research and development efforts and highlight the human aspects of the design and use
of computing systems. The papers thoroughly cover the entire ﬁeld of human-computer
interaction, addressing major advances in knowledge and effective use of computers in
a variety of application areas. The volumes constituting the full 27-volume set of the
conference proceedings are listed on pages IX and X.
I would like to thank the program board chairs and the members of the program
boards of all thematic areas and afﬁliated conferences for their contribution to the
highest scientiﬁc quality and the overall success of the HCI International 2016
conference.
This conference would not have been possible without the continuous and unwa-
vering support and advice of the founder, Conference General Chair Emeritus and
Conference Scientiﬁc Advisor Prof. Gavriel Salvendy. For his outstanding efforts,
I would like to express my appreciation to the communications chair and editor of HCI
International News, Dr. Abbas Moallem.

Abstract. When people are crossing the borders for studies, business and
migration purposes, they have to face the culture shock during the mingling of
new cultures. However, as online social networks can be reached anytime, from
anywhere in most cases where access to traditional networks is impossible, this
makes online social networks, particularly important to the sojourner who will
have to constantly resort to social support sources to cope with the difﬁculties
and psychological stress of cross-cultural adjustment. Nevertheless, the use of
online social networks in the context of cultural adjustment is an under explored
area. This study draws upon social network theory, social capital theory and
cultural adjustment perspectives, to develop a new model which can contribute
to the sparse literature on the impact of online social networks on cross-cultural
adjustment and serves a foundation for future research in this vital area of
inﬂuence of online social networks.

Introduction
There is extensive research currently conducted to understand and explain the notion of
cross-cultural adaptation, mostly from psychological and sociological aspects. These
researchworks and theoriesattempt to explain how anindividual moving from one culture
to another culture (mostly crossing the borders of the country) align his life to the new
culture, rules, customs and perceptions. The number of people crossing the borders yearly
for studies, business and migration purposes are increasing gradually [18]. Therefore, an
analysis on factors that contributes to the sojourners’ [18], people who are temporarily
residing in countries other than their home country, cultural adjustment is important.
Previous research work has explained cultural adjustment as a staged model of
recovery from the cultural shock [4], a learning process [3], a hybrid of both recovery
and learning [17], and equilibrium model as a dynamic and cyclic process for tension
reduction [4]. Cross-cultural adjustment is also viewed from a social support perspec-
tive, in which most of the interaction, learning and recovery related to cultural adjust-
ment is explained via an interaction framework [2]. These literatures have highlighted

that an immigrant or a sojourner will face resistance and shock during a cultural switch.
Individuals use various methods, and tools to accept the new environment and feel
habitual in the new culture. Acculturation [11], a process the society and people undergo
when two cultures mingle, has been studied in depth in order to determine the most
suitable process for a sojourner to be comfortable in the new environment. Online social
networks can be considered as a good support structure for acculturation because they
provide an opportunity to interact with the new environment and maintain the
sojourners’ old contact as well. Social networking sites have become an everyday tool in
our lives. Social network sites have received a tremendous amount of attention recently
by individuals and it is argued in this paper that social networks can inﬂuence cultural
adjustment. This research will study the social support perspective in multicultural
adjustment using the Social Network Theory [7, 22, 31] and attempt to show how a
sojourner for acculturation can use online social networks, the indispensable tool used
for networking in the present day.
As mentioned earlier, the number of people crossing borders is increasing. They
will undergo the cultural shocks discussed in the previous section, which has been
studied in psychology in depth. This study contributes to the above literature by
understanding how online social networking can be used for acculturation. It combines
the psychological theory on the social support perspective of cultural adjustment with
existing social networking theories, using today’s popular social networking media.
Apart from the theoretical contribution, the implications of the study recommends
different types social ties for sojourners to ﬁnd various social supports to overcome
depression, obtain afﬁrmation, improve skills and get tangible assistance, in the process
of adapting to the new culture. Based on the above theoretical and practical implica-
tions of this study, it can be considered that this research makes a signiﬁcant contri-
bution to the existing cross cultural adjustment literature.
The rest of this report is organized in the following manner. Section 2 discusses the
theoretical background and the Sect. 3 discusses the theoretical framework, including
the hypotheses. Section 4 explains the data collection, analysis and results. The Sect. 5
discusses the importance and implications of this study.

Theoretical Background
Cultural adjustment has been used interchangeably with cultural adjustment in the lit-
erature. It has also been variously deﬁned. [17] deﬁned cultural adjustment as a process in
which a person familiarizing with and is able to function effectively in a new culture.
Adelman [2] considers cultural adjustment as coping with uncertainty in and attaining
perceived mastery or control over the new cultural environment. According to Searle and
Ward [34], cultural adjustment includes a socio-cultural sense of adjustment and psy-
chological feelings of wellbeing. Ang, Van Dyne et al. [5] concur with Searle and Ward
[34] as they consider cultural adjustment as a person’s attainment of interactional
adjustment and general wellbeing. Earlier research has looked at the phenomenon of
cultural adjustment from an individual perspective. One of such key research is Black and
Stephens [16] which has contributed greatly to the literature on understanding the
acculturation of expatriates. This work was based on the threefold classiﬁcation: general
4
S. Adikari

adjustment, interaction adjustment and work adjustment by Black [13] and it became the
foundation for later research: [6, 14, 27, 33, 35–37]. However, [17] has proposed an
enhanced model which helps to measure adjustment in different dimensions while dis-
tinguishing between cognitions and emotions [10, 15, 24–26]. This model explores the
outcomes of adjustment in a cross-sectional sample of expatriates via the deﬁnitions of
constructs like novelty, discretion, self-efﬁcacy, and social networks.
In contributing to prior research, Ang, Van Dyne et al. [5] have developed the
constructs of cultural intelligence (CQ) [23] based on contemporary theories [20] in the
ofﬂine settings. They have enhanced the theoretical precision of cultural intelligence
[23] by developing a model which posits differential relationships between the four
dimensions of CQ (metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral) and three
intercultural effectiveness outcomes (cultural judgment and decision making, cultural
adjustment and task performance in culturally diverse settings). Testing the model
through several substantive studies, they have established a consistent pattern of
relationships between the four CQ dimensions and the three intercultural effectiveness
outcomes where metacognitive CQ and cognitive CQ predict cultural judgment and
decision making; motivational CQ and behavioral CQ predict cultural adjustment; and
metacognitive CQ and behavioral CQ predict task performance. Therefore, according
to Ang et al. [5], a sojourner to be culturally adapted, he or she needs to be achieved
cultural adjustment, cultural judgment, decision making and task performance essen-
ces. However, the cultural intelligence has only been tested in ofﬂine setting and not
applied to the online setting at all.
From a social network perspective, a social network involves a set of actors and the
relations that connect them [38]. The social network of actors (i.e., individual people,
organizations or families) consists of strong ties and weak ties. A tie is the relationship
between individuals in the network. Strong ties such as family or close friends [2, 29],
are more intimate and involve various forms of resource exchange. Weak ties such as
friends of friends, past colleagues, or other acquaintances [21], on the other hand,
involve fewer intimate exchanges and less frequent maintenance. They are considered
as valuable conduits to diverse perspectives and new information [21]. According to
Birnie and Horvath [12], social network theory is able to apply to describe human
relationships developed through either face-to-face communication or electronic
means. It is particularly relevant to the examination of how the Internet helps maintain
old ties and establish new ties [38]. SNSs, aside facilitating the maintenance of
pre-existing social ties and the creation of new connections [38], are considered to be
an important platform for individuals to manage a wider network of weak ties [21].
Social network theory is therefore applicable to examine online social networks
developed through SNSs.
Social capital has been used to describe the latent aggregated resources and beneﬁts
entrenched in the relationships with other people [19, 21], such as tangible assistance,
emotional support, assurances and skill acquisition [2]. Two kinds of social capital
have been discussed by Putnam [32]. Bonding social capital comes from strong ties
(i.e., close friends and family) in the form of emotional support [29] and tangible
resources [21]. Bridging social capital, conversely, “consists of loose relationships (i.e.,
weak ties) which serve as bridges connecting a person to a different network, allowing
the person access to new perspectives and diffuse information” [29].

Theoretical Framework
The research question addressed in this study is how cultural intelligence can be used to
measure online social networks of a sojourner inﬂuence on cross cultural adjustment.
The study has adopted the social support perspective of cultural adjustment from the
psychology literature and combines it with the social network theories in the infor-
mation systems literature to deliver a comprehensive model to analyze the inﬂuence of
the online social networks on acculturation.
Based on the social support perspective of cultural adaptation discussed by M.B.
Adelman [2] cultural adjustment is an indication of (1) coping with uncertainty and
(2) perceived mastery or control. The support of the society is classiﬁed into two
notions such as (1) supportive messages and (2) supportive sources. As earlier men-
tioned, the cultural intelligence [23] by Ang, Van Dyne et al. [5], can be deﬁned as a
measurement of sojourner’s capability to function and manage effectively in a cul-
turally diverse setting through meta-cognitive CQ, cognitive CQ, behavioral CQ, and
motivational CQ. This measurement has been further enhanced to demonstrate a
consistent pattern of relationship where motivational CQ and behavioral CQ predict
cultural adjustment. Combining the above two models, we argue that cultural adjust-
ment that is motivational CQ and behavioral CQ of the cultural intelligence is
equivalence to coping with uncertainty and perceived mastery or control of Adelman’s
model. Therefore, the equivalence to coping with uncertainty and perceived mastery or
control can be achieved through the relevant supportive messages. Furthermore, the
supportive messages received related to the cultural adjustment from the social network
could allow a sojourner to be adapted to the multi-cultural environment by adjusting to
the new culture and then have a sound cultural judgment and decision-making process.
As a fact that, the remaining two intercultural effectiveness outcomes that are speciﬁed
in the cultural intelligence (cultural judgment and decision making and task perfor-
mance) can only be achieved after a sojourner becomes adjusted to the new culture. We
also argue that different social support groups in the online social network will provide
support in the cultural adjustment process at different levels. This suggests that different
types of supportive messages will be provided by different groups, which is mainly
categorized as weak ties and strong ties based on the tie strength.
Based on the aforementioned arguments and the theoretical background, we pro-
vide the following model, which ultimately uses cultural intelligence to answer the
several sub-questions in the current research which are, (a) Does cultural intelligence
ample to measure cultural adjustment via social network settings? (b) Does a social
network allow an individual to have more cultural adjustment in the multi-cultural
environment? (c) Does the supportive messages received via social networks relate to
an individual’s multi-cultural adjustment. (d) How does strong and weak ties related to
different kind of supportive messages.
3.1
Proposed Model
Based on the social support perspective on coping with uncertainty of cultural
adjustment theory [2], we have identiﬁed four message types that can be considered as
6
S. Adikari

the support received by the network/surrounding for a sojourner. We have considered
these four messages as the independent variables of our model [4]. These four message
types support an individual to
1. Have perspective shifts on cause-effect contingencies: We have deﬁned this variable
as Overcome Depression(OD)
2. Enhance control through skill acquisition: We have deﬁned this variable as Skill
Improvement(SI)
3. Enhance control through tangible assistance: We have deﬁned this variable Tan-
gible Assistance(TA)
4. Enhance control through acceptance and assurance: We have deﬁned this variable
as Acceptance and Assurance(A&A)
The model describes that these messages are received by different types of sup-
portive sources in the sojourners’ network/surrounding. We consider these supportive
sources as the ties [22] in the network of the sojourner and identify it as a moderator that
supports an individual at different levels in cultural adjustment using the aforementioned
messages. The dependent variables we measure are, motivational CQ and behavioral
CQ, which we deﬁne as the cultural adjustment and it is measured by the cultural
intelligence of an individual [5]. Figure 1 depicts the complete proposed model.
3.2
Hypotheses
As per the model above, there are seven constructs, and following are the hypothesis
we have derived in order to ﬁnd answers to the initial research questions.
Overcoming Depression. Essentially, these messages aid the individual in modifying
negative causal attributions that contribute to feelings of being overwhelmed or
Fig. 1. Proposed theoretical model

depressed. For example, spouses can be overwhelmed by the enormous task of family
relocation, resulting in feelings of personal helplessness in organizing for the move.
Pre-departure assistance can function to help prospective sojourners in developing
realistic expectations and beliefs about personal capabilities that mediate stress [4].
Using online social networks sojourners can reduce their stress well by playing games,
simple conversation of similar experience and do other activities. Therefore the fol-
lowing hypothesis can be derived.
(H1) The extend of supportive messages received from the online social network to overcome
depression is positively related with the motivational cultural intelligence
Assurance and Acceptance. Emotional support in the form of validation of self-worth,
afﬁrmation of personal relationships, and a sense of belonging is a critical function of
these messages. Cross-cultural, adjustment, particularly given the disruption of old ties,
is dependent on the acceptance and reassurances of others in the new setting. Mem-
bership groups, of people undergoing similar changes, often serve to alleviate the stress
of culture-shock and provide an ersatz community [4]. Therefore, the following
hypothesis can be derived.
(H2) The extend of supportive messages received from the online social network for assurance
and acceptance is positively related with the motivational cultural intelligence
Tangible Assistance. This straightforward assistance of personal resources (e.g., time,
money, labor) cannot be underestimated in the initial and long-term adjustment to a
new environment. However, what makes such concrete assistance “supportive” are the
interpersonal messages which accompany this help. The old adage, “It’s not what you
say (give), but how you say (give) it” applies to offering tangible help to another. For
example, neighbors who offer to assist in childcare while moving into a new home can
promote feelings of social integration based on communal exchange or a contractual
arrangement based on monetary exchange [4]. Therefore the following hypothesis can
be derived.
(H3) The extend of supportive messages received from the online social network for tangible
assistance is positively related with the behavioral cultural intelligence
Skill Improvement. These supportive messages function to increase the skills of a
recipient to achieve desirable out-comes. Orientation programs for developing
cross-cultural communication skills and problem solving are representative of this type
of instructional support. Among informal networks, such as sojourning students’ ties
with host nationals, these message types function instrumentally to facilitate the aca-
demic and professional aspirations of the sojourner [4]. Therefore, the following
hypothesis can be derived.
(H4) The extend of supportive messages received from the online social network for skill
improvement is positively related with the motivational cultural intelligence.
(H5) The extend of supportive messages received from the online social network for skill
improvement is positively related with the behavioral cultural intelligence.
Strong Ties. The strong ties in the social network will be the community who the
sojourner interacts frequently, and who knows themselves in detail. These groups in the
8
S. Adikari

social network will help the sojourner to overcome the shock in the new environment
by helping to overcome depression. Furthermore, since they are more close to the
sojourner they will understand the sojourners’ feelings on the new environment and
will provide reassurance and afﬁrmation. Therefore, we derive the following two
hypotheses.
(H6) If the tie strength is stronger, then the relationship between the overcome depression and
motivational cultural intelligence will be stronger.
(H7) If the tie strength is stronger, then the relationship between the afﬁrmation/assurance and
motivational cultural intelligence will be stronger.
(H8) If the tie strength is stronger, then the relationship between tangible assistance and
behavioral cultural intelligence will be stronger.
Weak Ties. The weak ties in the social network will be the community who the
sojourner does not interact frequently or the people from the new community. There are
groups in the social network will main assist the sojourner in acquiring new skills and
to get tangible assistance.
(H9) If the tie strength is weaker, then the relationship between the skill improvement and
motivational cultural intelligence will be stronger.
(H10) If the tie strength is weaker, then the relationship between skill improvement and
behavioral cultural intelligence will be stronger.

Data Collection and Analysis
As stated above, the main emphasis of this research is to ﬁnd out the use of cultural
intelligence to measure the inﬂuence of online social network: the Facebook, on these
students to become culturally adjusted when they ﬁrst arrived in Singapore. Therefore
to conduct the survey on the above mentioned research question, we have used the
given questionnaire in the appendix that formulated according to the proposed
hypotheses. The questionnaire was created as the measurement instrument in-order to
measure the inﬂuence of online social networks on cultural adjustment. After an
extensive literature review, 29 items were selected to measure the 7 constructs. Since it
was required to measure which type social network ties provide each of the supportive
messages, there was a need to repeat the tie strength measurement questions for each
supportive message type. The validity of the questionnaire was checked using two
techniques; they are Face validity and Pretest. As the initial step, to evaluate the Face
validity, the developed questionnaire was given to several experts in the ﬁeld of
Information System (including senior PhD students) to review. The main purpose of
this step was to ensure the consistency of items and the constructs. After that, the
questionnaire was reﬁned based on their comments. As the second step, the ques-
tionnaire was distributed within 10 university town residents to complete as a pre-test.
This group consisted of graduate students and exchange students in the National
University of Singapore. The purpose of this test was to check the understandability of

the questions. Based on their feedback, the questionnaire was ﬁnalized as shown in the
appendix. As the next step of our study, the questionnaire was designed electronically
and distributed among the residents of University Town. 148 residents responded to the
survey, but only 130 cases were selected for analysis. To check whether the selected
sample is good enough to carry out the analysis, we have conducted the KMO and
Bartlett’s Test. According to the analysis results the KMO value is 0.799 and it is well
above the recommended value of 0.5 [30]. To further understand the underlying
relationships of the proposed factors and items, we have conducted Exploratory factor
analysis (EFA) and Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) [36]. Once AA1, OD4, MOT5,
BEH5, BEH4, BEH3, MC5, and MC4 items were removed remaining items are sat-
isﬁed the both convergent and discriminant validity.
The hypotheses were tested using LISREL. According to the Table 1, we can see that
only the hypotheses H3 and H8, is supported. That is the relationship between Tangible
assistance and Behavioral CQ. This implies that, the constructs Overcome depression,
Acceptance and Skill improvement, which were the antecedent for Motivational CQ, did
not surprisingly show any statistically signiﬁcant relationships. Also, the effect of Skill
improvement does not contribute to the Behavioral CQ. Aligned with the H8, we can say
that the tie strength is stronger sojourners receive more supportive messages related to
the tangible assistance and that leads to better achieve the behavioral CQ.

Discussion
The study ﬁnds that certain types of supportive messages from the online social net-
work assist in improving different aspects in cultural adaptation. As sojourners who
have come to a foreign country for studies, they have understood the possible sup-
portive sources in the online social networks and used it to become more culturally
aware and adjusted to the new environment. By being engaged in online social net-
works during the transition period from one culture to another culture across borders
the sojourner can expect to receive different types of supportive messages which can
help him be better prepared for the new environment. However, they should understand
that these supportive messages are capable of assisting in cultural adjustment only if the
sojourner is willing to act upon the information and emotional support received.
Intention to use online social networks for acculturation will increase over the time
due to high usage of social media amongst the society. As identiﬁed via the survey
most of the sojourners have received messages for tangible assistance via their social
network during the cultural adaptation. The survey only captures the extension of
messages received via the online social network for tangible assistance. It does not
indicate that the sojourner received the particular tangible assistance. However, as the
there is a positive correlation between the behavioral CQ and the tangible assistance

messages received via the online social network, it can be inferred that sojourners use
the online social network during the transition period to overcome certain cultural
difﬁculties.
The rest of the results as shown above indicates that there is no signiﬁcant rela-
tionship between the supportive messages received for depression, afﬁrmation, skill
improvement with the motivational or behavioral CQ. This result contradicts the
existing literature and our initial model predictions. Therefore, it is required to explore
the reasons for this contradiction.
The focal reason for the low signiﬁcance of the model could be due to the rela-
tionships build in the theoretical framework with the supportive messages and the
cultural adaptation. Even though previous studies have clearly indicated and justiﬁed
that cultural adjustment can be measured by the cultural intelligence measurements,
since many of the hypotheses are not supported in this framework, we suggest to
explore other measurements of cultural adjustment. Different measurements to measure
the uncertainty level and the perceived mastery the new environment could improve
these results [5]. Furthermore, there are other social network theories, which captures
the social capital of the sojourner [9] which could be considered as level of cultural
adjustment. We argue that these results could be made more signiﬁcant if a better
measurement of cultural adjustment can be devised based on certainty level and per-
ceived mastery in the new environment.
Therefore, for the future studies, it needs to be explored if a different measurement
for cultural adjustment can be obtained if the signiﬁcance of the model can be
improved. These two future actions are mandatory for this study in order to validate
the framework with high signiﬁcance levels. Also, from the theoretical perspective, the
framework is capable of capturing only the supportive messages received from the
online social networks. There could be a negative effect based on the messages
received via the online social network. Therefore, it is required to explore the negative
messages that can be given from an online social network to a sojourner, which could
tamper the effect from the positive supportive messages received from the social
network.
The objective of this study is to develop a comparative, theoretical model to
determine the use of cultural intelligence to measure the inﬂuence of the online social
network for acculturation in a sojourner’s life. The theoretical model was mainly built
upon the theory of social supportive perspective of cultural adjustment and social
network theories. Our results show that online social networks provide supportive
messages for tangible assistance, which leads to the behavioral CQ of a sojourner. In
conclusion, we attempt to explain the insigniﬁcance of relationships by highlighting
that the cultural intelligence score might not be the most suitable cultural adjustment
measurement in this context since the supportive messages received via the online
social network could have less inﬂuence on the cultural intelligence on the sojourner.
Therefore, we propose a revision to the measurement of cultural adjustment that should
be captured by the uncertainty level and perceive mastery of the sojourner in the online
settings.

Abstract. About forty years of thriving Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
have expanded into an aﬄuent and apparent diverse and enriching ﬁeld-for-all.
Subsequently this has given way to other ﬁelds such as Human-Work Interaction
Design (HWID), where a main focus stands on human-centred practices at work
regarding productivity and the ﬁnal fulﬁlment of humanly aims and goals. This
is in stark contrast with other ways of accepting the world, thus of work. HCI for
Development (HCI4D) often shows interdependences proposed in the Global
North often fail in settings like in the East or also in the Global South. This is
while technology permeates at rapid and unstoppable paces everywhere. If
HCI4D thus-far shows scant positive results, traditional HWID is seemingly
stagnated into modes of production having little to do with promoting actual
satisfaction, nor environmental sustainability, to mention a few further options.
As younger, novice participants enter academic and practitioner HCI grounds,
concepts, deﬁnitions and terminology resemble confusion at times, while in occa‐
sions these appear to depict archaic modes of distribution, self-empowerment and
development as inevitable in today’s technologically connected world. Ques‐
tioning thus existing globalised status-quos related to concepts, deﬁnitions and
deployments sparks into proposing fairer, more sustainable and micro-cultural
approaches to life via and by HCI. To achieve the above, the disentanglement of
established meanings through the dissemination of objects, concepts and HCI
deﬁnitions and terminologies is proposed by applying a theoretical and a prag‐
matic analysis. This is done with the aim of shedding clarity via reﬂection and
comprehension into mindfulness of ethical and integral possibilities.
This paper presents, proposes and discusses an approach to concepts and
words in everyday life such as work, interaction and development, as seen from
a myriad of cultural perspectives, cases and understandings. The ultimate objec‐
tive is to keep discerning past, present and future meanings in HCI, and the
connotations of such commonly used terms and expressions.

Introduction
About forty years now have got HCI thriving and expanding into an apparent diverse
and enriching ﬁeld-for-all. It is well known computers back then got initially disposed
to facilitate eﬃcient and eﬀective ways, though more recently they aim to evolve into
striving for a satisfactory usage. Subsequently this also gave way to several subﬁelds
such as HWID, where the main focus stands on the integration of work analysis and
interaction design methods for pervasive and smart workplaces, and where the intended
aim is in promoting human-centred practices in work places in regards to productivity
to fulﬁl humanly aims and objectives. With the breakthrough of cross-cultural HCI,
smart work places and philosophies from the Global North have recently trespassed
frontiers. This is so, for example, with HCI4D as a form of crossing and cutting into
cultural milieus whereby technology permeates at a rapid, ubiquitous, and unstoppable
pace. Such speed of this evolution, though, is all problematic to ﬁrmly catching-up with
by academic and practitioner spheres alike. This is while, often, agendas and interests
from some ‘other’ parties prevail. As a result of a lack in epistemological adaptation
HCI4D so-far shows scant positive results (Blake et al. 2014), whereas traditional HWID
can be somewhat seen as stagnated into modes of production having little to do with
promoting actual satisfaction, nor gratiﬁcation beyond the ﬁnancial means, nor envi‐
ronmental sustainability to mention but few aims. It is then that HCI, from its Global
North lieu of inception, seemingly keeps promising endless technological supplies and
innovations based on a swaying capitalistic system of depleting resources. This is a
system where many, at best, undergo competition issues even if not desiring to contend
at all. As younger novice participants permeate HCI academic and practitioner grounds,
contexts, concepts, deﬁnitions, and terminology often resemble confusion at times,
while in occasions they appear to depict archaic modes of distribution, self-empower‐
ment and development as inevitable in today’s connected world. Some of such appren‐
tices, thus, question the existing globalised status-quo of concepts, deﬁnitions and
deployments, while they propose a fairer, more sustainable and micro-cultural approach
to life through HCI (Löfstrom 2010). A way to strive towards achieving the above
objectives is by means of disentangling established terms and meanings through the
dissemination of the signiﬁcance of objects, concepts and HCI deﬁnitions, and termi‐
nologies, by applying a pragmatic analysis that scaﬀolds from the theory. Another way
is by looking at synonyms and antonyms so as to shed clarity via exempliﬁcation,
reﬂection, open-mindedness and an ultimate mutual comprehension. Thus, a study of
the evolving of words and meanings is hereby proposed into mindfulness, ethicality and
integrity among other possibilities for, and toward a better HCI-for-all.
This paper hence introduces ﬁrst, proposes later, and eventually, if constructively,
criticises and discusses a rhetorical and etymological approach to concepts and terms of
everyday life such as work, interaction and development as seen from a myriad of
cultural perspectives and understandings. This is then contextualised and intertwined
into HWID and HCI4D, together with concepts of HCI such as Usability and UX, as
well as with some of the methods, tools and techniques utilised in the ﬁeld of HCI such
personas. The objective is to keep discerning past, present and future meanings, and the
connotations of such commonly used terms and expressions. This is done by means of

exempliﬁcation of diﬀerent signiﬁers and signiﬁes of the terms aforementioned, and the
questions these provoke when seen from a kaleidoscopic viewpoint within, but also
beyond the understanding in the Global North. The ultimate aim is to establish HCI
advancements and to propose HCI in-the-making via reﬂecting the use of terms and
communicational tools and their meanings across cultures.
2
A ‘Bit’ of HCI History: The Proposal of a 4th ‘Gratifying’ Wave
The need to continuously reﬂect upon the history of HCI has to do with rapid changes
on the ﬁeld’s focus, together with its very recent emergence. Understanding reasons for
diﬀerent outcomes, we can then assess today’s visions more realistically, and tomor‐
row’s views, perhaps, more lucidly and sympathetically with us and others.
After the initial HCI wave of technical rationality, Grudin (2005) began to focus on
the cultural barriers that still today separate HCI and IS: HCI discovered the limitations
of laboratory studies and surveys to understand discretionary use of methods and the
focus of IS in research as based on the economic, organizational, and marketing theory
and practice of today.
The third wave of HCI claimed to expand from the working and computer-based
context into a broader environment of the mobile and the home, the everyday lives and
also into culture (Bødker 2006). This then meant to break the boundaries between work
and leisure, arts and the home. In other words, between rationality and emotion.
Grudin (2012) goes on arguing HCI as a ﬁeld amalgamating disciplines: human
factors, information systems, computer science, and library and information science. He
concludes that HCI, wherever studied, it will be in its early days of research. Reasons
to such a statement are changes on inﬂuences: new waves of hardware enable diverse
ways to support same activities; email changed the way we communicate; social
networking came along; the desktop computer has lost the spotlight to portable devices;
government and industry invest on parallel computing; diﬀerent patterns of technology
use emerge in diﬀerent cultures and in diﬀerent industries; accessibility and sustaina‐
bility are development areas; digital technologies changed people’s behaviors.
In their part, Sanders and Stappers (2014) argue the way design is done, and who is
responsible it, have evolved based on a move from the designing of things to interactions
to systems, and from designing for laypeople to designing with and by people.
As such, recent issues about the disciplinary of HCI have been debated because of
the prevalence and resistance of ‘the old modes’. Scaﬀolding from CHI publications
over the past 20 years, Kostakos (2015) shows HCI seemed to follow technical fashions
rather than long-term research themes, and argues HCI does not seem to have a solid
intellectual or methodological core. Reeves (2015) then recommends thinking of HCI
not as a discipline, but rather as an inter-discipline. This Rogers and Blackwell (2012)
agree upon, while they go deeply on the discussion stating there is a hole at the center
of HCI research. To explain this hole they focus on two case studies: one as a systematic
analysis of 180 collaborative projects on research in interdisciplinary design toward
understanding the insights into human behavior; a second case study comes as a survey
of interdisciplinary innovation. These studies allowed to reﬂecting on the use of theories
18
D.G. Cabrero et al.

and methods on other disciplines to do HCI work. Pan et al. (2012) are equally concerned
about HCI becoming a fashion-driven discipline. They propose to examine and explore
what might happen if HCI becomes a fashion-driven discipline.
Finally Rogers and Blackwell (2012) problematize whether HCI is a discipline or
not. It might not be, as Kim (1990) already advised, due to the need of interdisciplinary
cooperation, as HCI is not discipline but an interdisciplinary ﬁeld, thus a generality.
A contemplation of a fourth wave in HCI may well hence come-by and emerge from,
for example, problematizing methods, tools and techniques that do not make it into the
proceedings of big conferences such as CHI (Cockton 2013); also by propositioning to
solidly moving from User-Centered Design (UCD) philosophies of professional
designer and top management self-empowerment into a more Participatory Design (PD)
involvement of laypeople (Sanders 2002) in the construction of sustainable and grati‐
fying futures. It must not though be forgotten that wide participation is not it all, and
that innovation at times comes making a worthy breakthrough (Cockton 2013).
What seems clear to many more by the day is that there must be a liaison and a
humanly attuning in the adoption of human values towards a gratifying UX (Harper
et al. 2008), as well as a carefully drafted agenda toward an HCI research and practice
based on human needs and social responsibility (Muller et al. 1997).
As technology strives to connect with the human body and soul, we must now think
about the world as a small portion of the Universe, thus act with responsibility in devel‐
oping life and the human race with a set of values, ethics, and integrity that are coherent
with Gaia and all things in the world being interconnected (Laurel 2011).
3
Communication in HCI: Is It Issued or We Make It Ourselves?
Since as humans we are societal beings, communication is paramount ground for society
formation, information, comprehension, and at times for transgression too. Communi‐
cation though is greatest yet challenge in HCI in that, at its core, HCI strives to ﬁnd out
how to overcome a fundamental design challenge: how to draw on user-data to eﬀec‐
tively communicate relevant needs, requirements and aspirations to the design of tech‐
nologies (Grudin 2003). Cultural Usability emphasizes this challenge outside the Global
North, while it argues western prevailing methods as ill-suited beyond their realm
(Winschiers-Theophilus 2009). Thus if living in an interconnected world, methodolo‐
gies, methods, tools and techniques need of a further analysis and potential adaptation,
perhaps also a greater redesign when deployed “out there”.
Drawing on the HWID’15 pre-conference meeting held at the British Computer
Society (BCS) in London UK, a discussion took place about what the word work means.
Themes and proposals emerged as: aging users, independent lives and work modes,
happiness by purpose, long-term usage together with interest/change of technology,
boredom because of automatizing, current and new technologies, redundancy, smart
university/analytics and visualization, UX in factory, create work, phases in life, co-
creation, experience based products and value assessment, and the word work per-se.
While such conceptualizations are open to interpretation, we tackle them in the
section below by analyzing the origin and evolution of terms such as work, interaction
HCI Within Cross-Cultural Discourses
19

and development, and in the ensuing section we then propose some empirical under‐
standings across projects and cultural milieus as well.
4
An Approach to Signiﬁers and Signiﬁed Across Cultures
This section introduces and analyses terms as follows: work, development and interac‐
tion. This is in order to oﬀer some understandings across cultures and settings, and to
ﬁnd out what sustainability, social change and empowerment are or can be.
4.1
Work
In his seminal work “Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society” Williams (1983)
analyzed the historical evolution of many major terms for culture and society. Not
surprisingly most of these expressions are still very common, while their meaning
continuously evolves through cultures and along societal changes and agendas.
The sense of the word Work, in particular, is described by Williams as changed from
“activity and eﬀort or achievement” to “steady or timed work” (Williams 1983, p. 103)
underlining its peculiarity of imposed condition. This leads to the consideration of Work
as an activity performed for a wage or a salary, therefore strictly related to being hired.
The word Career, in contrast, is described as focusing on the relationship the concept
has with a person’s progress in life, without only being the Work activity (ibid, 1983).
Given his political inclinations, Williams’ opinions about pursuing a career are very
strong, especially when eﬀorts to reaching promotion are compared with a rat race.
A further publication very critical on today’s economic scenario and that criticizes
how work is considered in a capitalistic society is “The Corrosion of the Character”
(Sennett 2000). Here people are speciﬁcally described as individuals now used to
concepts like ﬂexibility, teamwork, delayering, and ever-changing working conditions
being presented as new opportunities for self-fulﬁllment. For Sennett, however, these
are to be seen as new forms of oppression leading to damages in workers’ well-being.
The cause on the above might be found, among others, in the depletion of world
natural resources, as much as in the long working hours for many which, paradoxically,
contrast with the large amount of poverty and unemployment in many sites worldwide.
In Knopf (2014), the need of adopting new technologies for implementing renewable
energies, and sectorial strategies in the electricity and transport sector is considered
mandatory to keep the 2-degree limit in our future.
Some of the HCI research community is hence being attentive about environmental
sustainability. An example of research work comes from Dourish (2010), who focuses
on discussing the use of ICTs to promote and support environmental sustainability and
ecological awareness in the technology user. This shakes and pushes the idea of a new
way of being HCI designers and developers, and to improve consciousness about the
impact and consequences of the use of technology and IT in general in the World.

4.2
Development
Development as a term originates in the Global North, though it was initially contex‐
tualized as a word of technological possibilities (Williams 1983) rather than for dimin‐
ishing and disempowering (Escobar 1995). Synonyms such as unfold and unroll
(Williams 1983, p. 103), though, entice to think of the possibility of recounting from
the myriad of perspectives and viewpoints that the world provides nowadays.
Then, antonyms of such a term are undeveloped or underdeveloped, which, through
these verbal tangles, an often generous idea of ‘aid to the developing countries’ is
confused with wholly ungenerous practices of cancellation of the identities of others, by
their deﬁnition as underdeveloped or less developed, and of imposed processes of devel‐
opment for a world market controlled by others (ibid, p. 104).
Development as expressed in an old/new meaning scaﬀolds precisely from the
contrary to what Williams (1983) presents above. Development thus has to do with the
development of all people’s educational intellect to allow, encourage and empower this
type of growth, rather than the one of suppression as understood by mechanisms of
suppression and agendas of colonial interest.
Development, then, as a term applied to HCI4D, must be analytically reassessed.
This is because it otherwise (1) symbolizes a constructed set of meanings, whereby
dependency is the norm from historical agendas that encourage systematic workings and
variations serving imperialistic plans and schemas; and (2) a sense of underdeveloped
societies in relation to the developed economies (ibid, 1983, p. 103).
Development as evolutionary acquires sense if/when localities are taken into account
as per speciﬁc sets characteristics shaping livelihoods in particular geographical milieus,
and in a way that, when Nations proceed in a course of Development, their later mani‐
festations being potentially present in the earlier elements (ibid, p. 103).
4.3
Interaction
Etymologically, interaction refers to a mutual or reciprocal action, e.g. communication
among people, or actions of people that aﬀects others. The study, thus, of rhetoric
advanced from being focused exclusively on discourse, in Ancient Greece, to the inclu‐
sion of interactive audiovisual elements in the 20th century.
Nowadays, a ubiquitous digital world releases a new ﬁeld of research, which might
be called “rhetoric of interaction”. Rhetorical possibilities can be analyzed in interactive
design by some of the aspects in traditional rhetoric studies: ethos, logos and pathos,
while a rhetorical approach to design can provide methods and principles to understand
people’s culture and context.
Care must though be taken, as looking to synonyms and antonyms of interaction one
ﬁnds communication, contact, collaboration, as much as apathy, triviality or lethargy.
In our analysis and proposal interaction is then expressed as an old/new meaning
based on the origins of human-to-human interaction with participatory values of integ‐
rity and ethicality based on respect and fraternity.
Sennett (2000) argues the personal consequences of work in the New Economy
have led to disorientation of the individual because of the use of concepts like ﬂexibility,
HCI Within Cross-Cultural Discourses
21

decentralization and control, ﬂextime, change and long-term commitment, as well as
work ethics and teamwork. People, Sennet argues, have to cope with new concepts of
ﬂexibility, ﬂextime, teamwork, de- layering and ever-changing working conditions that
superﬁcially present new opportunities of self- fulﬁllment to workers, but that in reality
they create new forms of subjugation, confusing individuals and deteriorating their
emotional and psychological well-being. Ultimately, the solution proposed by Sennett
is to do with the necessity of people to rely on communities to build-up their own
identities.
Scaﬀolding from the above, several aspects of HCI research such as UX, aesthetics
and design thinking are then more problematic to research in a traditionally scientiﬁc
way. Pan (2012) argues that fashion in relation to interaction design has a place in HCI,
as it becomes an inﬂuence on the decisions and judgments made by HCI practitioners
and researchers. Other authors subscribe this approach in that fashion aﬀects interaction
designers’ design thinking in relation to functionality, appearance, UX and visual
experience.

Exemplifying HWID Together with HCI4D
Portraying diverse ways of doing this section exempliﬁes work on HWID together with
HCI4D to convey the above terms via pragmatic examples from literature.
5.1
Work
Irani and Silberman (2013) designed and developed Turkopticon as a system that allows
workers to publicize and evaluate their relationship with their employers. This work is
considered as activism as it stems from a strong critique to the invisibility of workers in
the human computation domain, as represented by the popular Amazon Mechanical Turk
system. Workers have been provided for two years with an anonymized integrated
system allowing them to rate their experience with the employers.
Unfortunately such a worker-oriented perspective is not as common. Exceptions are
mostly related to activist groups or non-proﬁt organizations. For example, WWF
published “Common Cause: The Case for Working with our Cultural Values”
(Crompton 2010) to promote an ethical approach deﬁning causes “bigger-than-self”.
In these regards, there is still a rather amount of work to be done in unmasking powers
and forces of oppression that neither allow for full values, nor for a sustainable and
integral way of working in an ethical, integral and constructive manner.
5.2
Development
Promising and uplifting examples of ways forward in development are found in places
that, due to the utter scarcity of resources, enable leeway and ﬂexibility in creating and
molding from quasi-blank canvases. An instance of this comes from informal settle‐
ments like Havana in Katutura, in the outskirts of Windhoek, Namibia. In such an
underdeveloped and uncared for locality, there are major deﬁes such as a paucity of
22
D.G. Cabrero et al.

basic living facilities typical of slums. These correspond to inadequate housing, and a
lack of electrical reach, access to potable water, and hygiene resources like proper
showers to serve sanitation. Besides, wastelands surrounding inhabitants’ shanties,
abusive drunkenness, and a great lack of education are the daily encounters for the
inhabitants in such local (Cabrero et al. 2015).
To improve the above, and to allow scope to generate bottom-up possibilities straight
from the ground, a project that combines partakers such as a university and some of its
students, designers, researchers, facilitators, ONGs, political bodies such as embassies
to foreign countries, and the local councilors is developing educational eﬀorts speciﬁ‐
cally to do with the development of the community’s intellect to allow, encourage and
empower a sustainable, culturally-aware type of growth by means of skill provision and
training, as well as of a community center (Winschiers-Theophilus et al. 2015a; b).
In such environments, besides, HCI forms an important part in that, by means of
User-Created Personas (Cabrero et al. 2015), regular youth in Havana gain advantage
in creating representations of themselves via person-like representatives that convey
their needs, requirements and ambitions towards the design of logistics and, in particular,
of technologies that aim to ameliorating their situations and progression in life.

World Machines: Providing Deﬁnitions to Sharing Economies
Nowadays, given the complexity of many design problems, the “participation of more
knowledge than any single person possesses” (Fischer 2005, p. 1) is fundamental for
creating a successful project, idea, or artifact. Such a collaborative approach stems from
several years of research progresses led to the deﬁnition of Reﬂective Practitioners and
Reﬂective Communities (ibid 2005). The idea beyond these concepts is to support not
only collaborative design and development in HCI, but to help all partakers in over‐
coming the communication distance between diﬀerent minds, expertise, and points of
view. Reﬂective Communities are based on what is called Shared Understanding that
needs to be created ad hoc for speciﬁc communities that collaborate and share a common
objective.
In the recent years, the need of addressing UCD processes is becoming more common
than not. With such paradigm shift from UCD to PD, a natural need comes to form the
new generation of “Universal Access Designers” (Keates 2011). For doing this,
upcoming and existing generations need be informed on Usability, Accessibility and
User Experience as pinpointing the signiﬁcance in considering the widest possible range
of users in a speciﬁc workplace or situation.
At the basis of this approach, there is a socio-technical design methodology that
considers both the technical aspects and the human factors as a very interrelated matter.
The concept of World Machines introduces an archetype and a way to design a group
of tools able to combining computational powers with a so-called social agenda for
cross-cultural collaboration (Light et al. 2015), which speciﬁcally focuses its attention
in the connection between Sharing, Environment and Ecological Thinking.

Conclusion
This paper has presented rhetorical and etymological approach to concepts and words
of everyday life such as work, interaction and development seen from a myriad of
cultural perspectives and understandings. In order to continue developing technological
means that can satisfy the very ﬁnal user, a coherent understanding of the peoples’
agendas must be bore in mind at all times.
To empower laypeople with HWID and HCI4D methodologies, methods, tools and
techniques can enable new ways of making concepts of HCI such as Usability and UX
to evolve in diverse and varied ways that make the world to progress under a myriad of
viewpoints and perspectives.
This will in turn allow for a richer understanding of the past, the present and the
future to come in HCI, while reﬂecting upon the use of terms and communicational tools,
and their respective meanings across cultures.

Abstract. The purpose of this study is to ﬁnd how to develop a user-friendly
Chinese hand input system for the touch devices. A case is studied to discover
the factors which inﬂuencing the users’ experience in the Chinese hand input. In
the case, three personas are developed to test the usability of Chinese hand input
systems of three diﬀerent touch devices (i.e. smartphone, tablet personal computer
and all-in-one computer). The typical personas and process for Chinese hand input
are established according to the result of the case study. This study also indicates
the usability consideration for a Chinese hand input system. The results of this
study can be applied to product design of Chinese hand input system and future
research on Chinese hand input.

Introduction
Chinese input system is widely used in the touch-sensitive devices such as smartphones
or tablet personal computers. People input Chinese characters by their ﬁngers including
the thumb, index ﬁnger and middle ﬁnger. Comparing to Chinese Pinyin (i.e. Chinese
Phonetic Alphabets) input, hand input is friendlier to users who are not familiar with
Chinese Pinyin. In fact, Chinese Pinyin is studied from 1955, authorized by Chinese
National People’s Congress in 1958 and became an international standard in 1982 (ISO
7098:1991 1991). This standard is revised in 2015 (ISO 7098:2015 2015). Thus,
although Chinese Pinyin is the most frequently-used approach in Chinese input on the
touch devices currently, it is diﬃcult to input with Chinese Pinyin for many users who
are not familiar with or even have never learned Chinese Pinyin. In this situation hand
input provides a good alternative to those users who have diﬃculties in inputting Chinese
characters with its Pinyin. Previous studies indicated that Chinese calligraphy (i.e. the
beautiful handwriting of Chinese characters on paper) brought positive emotions (Kwok
et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2010). Considering aesthetic aspects of hand input on mobile
touch devices may improve the user experience (Chen et al. 2014).
Previous studies have made much eﬀort on Chinese hand input but most of the
researchers focus on the algorithms and their purpose is to recognize the handwritten
Chinese characters. Chinese user in the hand input system doesn’t attract enough atten‐
tion. It is shown that input positions, ﬁngers’ dimensions, fatigue of ﬁngers’ movements

and other factors related to the user of Chinese hand input system will have inﬂuence
on the performance of the Chinese handwriting (Chen et al. 2013; Tu et al. 2012;
2015). Input positions, including one-hand held input, two hand-held input and on hand-
held input depends on the dimension and weight of the touch devices. For the small size
of mobile touch device such as smartphone, both of one-hand held and two-hand held
positions are possible to the hand input users. For the large size of mobile touch devices
such as tablet personal computers, two-hand held is the most appropriate position to
input. And for the large size of touch devices such the KIOSK or touch screen on the
automatic teller machine or library information center, no hand-held position is used
when the touch device is ﬁxed and supported. Fingers’ dimensions, including the width
of the ﬁngers, the length of the ﬁngers, the area of the ﬁngers and etc., will also aﬀect
the Chinese handwriting (Chen et al. 2014). The width of the ﬁngers and area of the
ﬁngers reﬂect the size of the input box as it diﬃcult to input when the input box is smaller
than the area of the input ﬁnger. The length of the ﬁnger aﬀects the location of the input
box especially when one-hand held position is adopted. As Chinese characters are
composed of multiple strokes and radicals, a lot of ﬁngers’ movements are required to
complete one character and consequently fatigue of ﬁngers should be studied. The
acceptable level of fatigue of ﬁngers should be studied to improve the user’s experience
of handwriting. The thumb is used to input while one-hand held position is adopted and
index ﬁnger or middle ﬁnger is used to input while two-hand held position is adopted.
Current research studied the interface for thumb touch on the smart devices but thumb
input on Chinese handwriting still need more attention (Park and Han 2010, p. 8; Parhi
et al. 2006).
On the other hand, individual diﬀerences require more attention when developing a
user-friendly touch device for Chinese handwriting. Users with diﬀerent education
backgrounds may have diﬀerent cognitive process when handwriting a Chinese char‐
acter into a touch device. Users with diﬀerent ages may have diﬀerent movement abilities
to hand input Chinese characters. For example, the ﬁngers’ movements of the elderly
people are quite slower than other people (Zhou et al. 2012) and meanwhile it should
not be neglected that slow and clear handwritten scripts lead to higher accuracy.
Interface design is the key issue in the interaction of Chines hand input. The size of
the input box, the location of the input box, display of handwritten script, display of
alternative recognized characters and so on will have a possible eﬀect on the user expe‐
rience of Chinese handwriting. It is examined that an optimized interface can improve
the input time and accuracy of Chinese handwriting (Chen et al. 2013; 2014; Ren and
Zhou 2009; Tu et al. 2013). A good interface design lead to higher performance and
users’ satisfaction.

The interview questions focus on the following items.
• Background (age, education level, job, years of using touch devices).
• Description of the situations of using hand input for Chinese on the touch devices,
including mobile phones, tablet personal computers, all-in-one computers.
• Diﬃculties of using Chinese hand input systems.
• Suggestions for Chinese hand input systems.
Persona 1: JIANG Yu is a housewife. She is 54 years old. She had a middle school
educational experience. She comes from Hujiang Providence in the south of China and
she has some accent, so she is not good at Pinyin of Chinese characters. She enjoys in
playing iPhone and iPad. She send the text message directly and send the message via
online chatting platforms including Tencent QQ. She likes cooking very much so she
usually searches recipes on iPad to help her cooking. In her spare time, she also likes
watching TV shows on All-in-one computer. The romantic story is her favorite type. So
she searches the keywords of opera type or star name in online TV websites.
Persona 2: ZHANG Ming is an operator in a steel factory who is responsible to
making molds. He is the husband of Yu, 57 years old. He also had a middle school
educational experience. But he took a computer skills training for three years in his 30 s
and he is proﬁcient in using CAD, Photoshops, and other graphics software. He uses
touch mobile phone to send short e-mails to his colleagues. He spends most of his time
in the all-in-one computer for his work and entertainment. He makes short comments
when he read news on websites.
Persona 3: ZHANG Hua is now a senior college student who major in software
engineering. Hua is the son of Yu and Ming. He almost has his smartphone with him no
matter where he is. His social life is through his mobile phone. He comments on the
photos and status of his friends. He uses mobile search engineering to look up interesting
things. He also likes pop songs and he always has a long song list on his music appli‐
cations and he likes to make personal tags to these songs. Labels he used is “Shower
song” (i.e.  ), “to my girlfriend” (i.e.  ), “study times”(i.e. ),
“keep silent for moment”(i.e. 	
), “think alone” (i.e. ). He often uses
his mobile phone with his right hand.
Three touch devices are used in this study, which are a 4.7-in. mobile phone, a 9.7-
in. tablet personal computer and a 21.5-in. all-in-one computer with touch screen
(Fig. 1).

Results and discussion
Based on the persona and their stories the focus group creates three typical scenarios for
Chinese hand input on the touch devices.
• Sending text message via mobile phone or mobile chatting applications.
• Searching keywords in online applications, including search engine, musical appli‐
cation, video websites via the touch devices.
• Short comments on the news, friends’ status, and photos.
Figure 2 shows the hand input process for Chinese character in three scenarios. This
process is iterative, when user ﬁnd all of the recognized characters are not their target
character they would choose to rewrite the character. And user touches the functional

The typical interface of Chinese hand input system on the touch devices includes the
input area, recognized character area and functional area. The recognition algorithm and
dataset are also essential to Chinese hand input. In the physical level, the texture of the
touch screen and reactions time of touch action is also important to the Chinese hand
input users. Table 3 shows the list of usability considerations of Chinese hand input
system based on the results of focus group. The results are useful to improve the usability
of current Chinese hand input system and make the system user-friendlier.

Input Area. The design of input area is the most important interface design. Beside
the general interface design considerations such as color, color, shape, value, direction,
there are some design considerations for the Chinese handwriting. First, the size of input
box is the critical factor for the eﬀective handwriting area. The size of input box should
be suitable to users’ ﬁnger size no matter which ﬁnger user use to handwrite Chinese
characters. And meanwhile the input box should be large enough so that users can see
clearly of the handwritten scripts in the process of handwriting. The size of input box
also has a connection to the size of handwritten scripts. Although handwritten script is
individually diﬀerent, the input box size limits the handwriting area and consequently
30
Z. Chen et al.

inﬂuences the input performance such as input time. The national and international
standards have demonstrated the ﬁnger size for Chinese (CNIS 1988; 1996). But updated
and detailed dimensions of ﬁnger size for Chinese are still working in progress currently.
Previous studies have indicated the optimal size of input box on hand-held devices
should be 30 mm × 30 mm (Chen and et al. 2013; 2014). However, it is not clear that
the optimal input size for Chinese handwriting on small display size such as smart watch
or large display size such as Kiosk.
The location of input box is the key issue that probably has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on the handwriting performance and users’ subjective ratings. The location of input box
reﬂects to the distance between the relaxing position to the handwriting position. The
distance will reﬂect to the input time in handwriting. And it should be taken into consid‐
eration that the necessary information can display on the screen while handwriting. For
example, user may check the name and phone number of the contact person when hand‐
writing the text message to them. Inappropriate location design for input box may lead
to blocking the sight for display. Thus design consideration on location of input box is
important to balance display and input. And the dominant hand may be another factor
related to the location of input box. Location design for the right-handed users may not
suitable for the left-handed users.
It is probably better if the background of input box has similarity to the paper in
paper and pen-based handwriting task. Chinese users learn and train their handwriting
skills in the paper using pen. The familiarity of the system will increase if the design of
the background of input box is close to the paper, for example, imitating the texture and
color of paper for the background of input box. It is shown that “” style or “Nine block
box” is the assistive way that young Chinese learn handwriting Chinese characters (Chen
and et al. 2014), as shown in Figure 4. Thus it is better to consider to add this photo to
the background of the input box so that the handwriting on touch devices are consistent
with users’ mental model and expectations.
Fig. 4. Background design in paper-pen based Chinese handwriting
Script weight is another issue should be specially considered in the input area. If the
script weight is too low it will not match the users’ mental model as user expect the
script weight should be consistent with the tip of handwriting ﬁnger. This expectation
results from users’ experiment in paper and pen based handwriting experience as the
script weight is connected to the thickness of the tip of pen. The script weight should
not be too high because it is hard to distinguish each stroke especially when in some
cases Chinese characters with dozens of strokes are used in handwriting task.

Recognized Area. Like the input box, the size and location of shown characters, the
script weight should be taken into considerations when designing a user-friendly
Chinese handwriting system. These design factors have direct connections to the hand‐
writing performance. Since the main task in the recognized area is to select the target
character, there are some special design considerations for the recognized area, such as
the style of shown characters, number of shown characters, words and sentence, char‐
acters mixed with alphabetical letters, numbers, symbols, Chinese sentences. Taking the
number of shown characters for example, how many of recognized characters should
be shown in the recognized area is one of the key factors. In an idea situation, the recog‐
nition system and recognition algorithm will correctly understand users’ intention and
there is no need to shown any recognized character to let user select the target character.
However, due to the handwriting style and connecting strokes and other reasons, it seems
impossible to skip the selecting step with the current recognition system. The more
shown characters there are, users have more choice to select but will spend more time
on visual search and ﬁnger movements. Thus the number of shown characters depends
on many other factors such as handwriting scenarios, display size.
Functional Area. There is a functional area in the Chinese handwriting interface which
leave the space for the button of delete, conﬁrm, input system swift, send, ignore and
etc. The key to design functional area is to ﬁnd users’ speciﬁc handwriting requirement
and design for it. For example, when user are exploring the Internet and searching the
keywords with the Chinese handwriting system. The keep a button named “search” is
appropriate.
Recognition Algorithm. Recognition algorithm is critical to the input accuracy and
input time and directly inﬂuence users’ subjective rating on the whole Chinese hand‐
writing system. Using an adequate and fast algorithm may reduce the reaction time and
even minimize the strokes user need to handwrite. It is essential that one of the most
important reasons inﬂuencing users’ satisfaction on Chinese handwriting is that some
Chinese characters have so many strokes to handwrite.
Dataset. Chinese semantic meaning needs consideration in the design. Chinese is
composed of character, words and sentence. It will help to save the input time when the
handwriting system can suggest the word or sentence based on uses’ writing history or
usage history.
Physical Realization. It is also important to consider the physical features of the touch
devices such as touch technology, screen texture, system response time.

Abstract. This study investigated whether group members’ participation inﬂu‐
ence individuals’ gifting behaviors. The experiment was conducted on the plat‐
form of WeChat Red Packet, which is a currently prevalent money gifting social
game. Forty-eight participants were recruited. Two studies were conducted. Study
1 focused on the ratio of group partners who participated in the gift exchange
(participation ratio) and Study 2 focused on the total frequency of gifts sent by
partners (partners’ frequency). The results of Study 1 showed that in a friend
group, higher friends’ participation ratio in gifting social games motives individ‐
uals to send gifts more times; whereas in a stranger group, group members’
participation ratio does not inﬂuence the individual’s gifting behaviors. Study 2
suggested that in both friend and stranger groups, higher partners’ frequency
motives participants to send more gifts but shows no inﬂuence on the amount of
monetary value of the gifts sent by participants.

Introduction and Background
The “red packet war” during the 2015 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday between two
of China’s Internet giants, Tencent and Alibaba, has attracted the attention of billions
of Chinese people. Red packet is a kind of prevalent money gifting social games and
these games are usually designed as an in-app function. The name of red packet literally
means a red packet ﬁlled with money, given as a gift to friends and families. The
competition reached its peak on New Year’s Eve. More than one billion digital red
envelopes (authorized to connect with users’ bank cards) were sent through Tencent’s
Wechat Lucky Money users on that night, compared with 240 million by Alipay Wallet
(Chen 2015).
The kind of money gifting social games is traceable to Chinese traditions. Gifting
red packet is one of the most ancient Chinese traditions and is frequently employed in
various interpersonal interaction situations, such as festivals and celebrations. As a
unique cultural phenomenon, the tradition is always referred to as a cultural case in
research in the ﬁelds of cultural study (Millington et al. 2005; Wang 2015), business
(e.g. Luo 2008), and doctor-patient relationship (e.g. Huﬀman and Hochster 2007; Hurst
2009).

The red packet is usually gifted in a group chat context and group members share
the amount in the packet. Group-level factors will inﬂuence money gifting behaviors
(Dholakia et al. 2004). Previous research indicated that membership (Yoo et al. 2002),
group norms and social identity (Dholakia et al. 2004; Zhou 2011), reciprocity and pro-
social behaving duty (Wasko and Faraj 2000) inﬂuence member participation in group
activities, but little research ever took consideration of other group members’ partici‐
pation in the investigation of individual’s gifting behaviors. Research indicated that
people participate out of reciprocity and they increased the participation if others
contribute more participation (Wasko and Faraj 2000). In addition, previous study indi‐
cated that interpersonal relationships inﬂuence both behaviors on social media (Aral and
Walker 2014; Burke and Kraut 2014) and money oﬀering behaviors (Chen and Rau
2016). This study focused on the eﬀects of interpersonal relationships on money gifting
behaviors in social games.
Therefore, this study aimed to investigate in different group contexts in which
individuals have different interpersonal relationships with the group members, how
group participation influenced individuals’ behaviors in money gifting social games.
Two studies were conducted and focused on different aspects of group participa‐
tion. Study 1 focused on the ratio of group members who participated in the lucky
money gifting game and Study 2 focused on the total frequency of lucky money sent
by group members. For a clear description, the focus of Study 1 is shorten to the term
of group participation ratio and the focus of Study 2 is shorten to the term of part‐
ners’ frequency. Two typical interpersonal relationships were selected as the
subjects, including close friends and strangers. The two studies followed the same
experiment design and procedures.

Experiment Design
This study chose WeChatTM as the experiment platform. WeChat is one key mobile
instant messaging application developed by TencentTM and it is the winner in the red
packet war. WeChat launched its money gifting social game, WeChat Lucky Money,
on 17 January 2014 (Liu et al. 2015). Lucky Money can be gifted in WeChat group chat
as a group message. Group members click the message and received a sub-packet of the
Lucky Money. WeChat divided the amount of Lucky Money into several sub-packet
randomly. The number of the sub-packet is identiﬁed by the sender. Group members
share the Lucky Money and reciprocate it.
To manipulate a group chat context for participants, the role of four “fake partici‐
pants” were design who cooperated with the real participation. Two fake participants
were male and the other two were female. Fake participants behaved following standard
behaving processes. The real participant in this experiment was informed that he/she
should complete experimental tasks with other four group members but they ﬁve were
separated in ﬁve room so that they could communicate via a WeChat group chat rather
than face-to-face contact.
Group Participation Inﬂuence on Members’ Gifting Behaviors

This study developed two typical scenarios for the close friend and stranger scenarios
respectively. Participants experienced both scenarios in the experiment. In the close
friend scenario, participants were asked to discuss gathering during the festival holiday
which would come soon. In the stranger scenario, participations were asked to discuss
a piece of teamwork about each others’ hometown food.

Study 1
Study 1 investigated whether lucky money gifting behavior was inﬂuenced by tie
strength and group participation ratio in lucky money gifting.
3.1
Variables
The independent variable of group participation ratio was a between-subject one and
had two levels: complete and partial. The complete level meant that in this condi‐
tion, all the four fake participants gifted a five-RMB lucky money packet once in
both scenarios. The partial level meant that in a partial condition, two fake partici‐
pants gifted five-RMB (equal to around 0.77 US dollars) lucky money packets twice
in both scenarios. Both the total value (20 RMB equal to around 3 US dollars) and
count of lucky money packets gifted by the four fake participants in two conditions
were the same, in order to avoid the influence of the amount and frequency of lucky
money gifted by group members on participants’ behaviors.
The amount and frequency of lucky money oﬀered by participants in each scenario
were recoded as two dependent variables. The two variables were shortened to the terms
of participant gifting amount and participant gifting frequency.
Tie strength with the fake participants were recorded as a control variable before
each scenarios using the scale developed by Gilber and Karahalios (2009). Participant’s
background information, previous WeChat and Lucky Money experience were also
recorded.
3.2
Participants
Forty-eight participants were recruited and were divided into two group participation
ratio conditions, 16 participants in the complete condition and 32 participants in the
partial condition. Two samples were gender balanced. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀer‐
ence in the ages between to samples (complete: Mean = 20.81, SD = 0.90; partial:
Mean = 20.41, SD = 1.24; p > .05).

Results
3.3.1
Manipulation Eﬀectiveness Check
The results of the independent sample t-test indicated that there were no signiﬁcant

conditions (all p > .05). The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test indicated
that in both conditions, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the tie strength among the
four fake participants according to scenarios (all p > .1) and in both sceneries, there was
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the tie strength in the two conditions (all p > .05).
These results suggested the eﬀectiveness of experimental manipulation and thus further
comparisons between the two conditions were conducted. The results of the paired
sample t-test indicated that in both conditions, the tie strength with close friends was
higher than the tie strength with strangers (complete: t = − 9.584, p < .001; partial:
t = − 19.180, p < .001); this suggested that participants indeed perceived the diﬀerences
the interpersonal relationships between the two scenarios.
3.3.2
Gifting Behaviors
The data of participant oﬀering amount and frequency did not follow the residual
normality and homogeneity of variance, and thus non-parametric Mann-Whitney was
used for the analyses of participant gifting behaviors. In the close friend scenario,
participant gifting frequency in the complete condition was lower than the frequency in
the partial condition (p < .05) whereas in the stranger scenario, there was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in participant gifting frequency between two conditions (p > .1). In both
scenarios, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in participant gifting amount between
two conditions (both p >     .1). The detailed analyses results are listed in Tables 1 and
2. Table 3 shows the frequency analyses of the lucky money participants oﬀered.

Study 2
Study 2 investigated whether individuals’ lucky money gifting behavior was inﬂuenced
by the total frequency of lucky money gifted by the fake participants.
4.1
Variables
The total sum of lucky money was related to the total frequency. It is reasonable to
assume that sum amount of lucky money sent by the fake participants would inﬂuence
participants’ gifting behaviors. Considering that, we asked two fake participants to send
a large amount of lucky money and the other two to send a small amount more times.
Hence, the eﬀects of total sum sent by the fake participants would be decreased. The
independent variable of partners’ frequency was also a between-subject one and had two
levels: high and low. The high level meant that in this condition, two fake participants
gifted a twenty-RMB lucky money packet once and the other two fake participants gifted
one-RMB lucky money packets three times in both scenarios. The low level meant that
two fake participants gifted a twenty-RMB luck money packet once and the other two
fake participants gifted a one-RMB lucky money packet once in both scenarios. In high
level the total sum of lucky money gifted by partners was 46 RMB (equal to around 7.1
dollars), whereas in the low level this ﬁgure was 42 RMB (equal to around 6.5 dollars).
The small variation in the total sum of lucky money sent by partners could be ignored
in a WeChat group chat context. Participants’ evaluation of the value of the lucky money
was assessed with one post-scenario question: “How appropriate was the total amount
of money sent by other partners during the discussion using lucky money?” Responses
were given on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 7 = ‘far too many’ to 1 = ‘far
too little’. Perceptions of the amount sent in conditions 4 and 5 were similar (p > .1).
The dependent variables were the same as those in Study 1.

Participants
Sixty-four participants were recruited and were divided into two partners’ frequency
conditions, 32 participants in the high condition and 32 participants in the low condition.
Each condition was gender balanced. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the ages
between to samples (high: Mean = 20.13, SD = 1.34; low: Mean = 20.56, SD = 1.37;
p > .1).

Results
4.3.1
Manipulation Eﬀectiveness Check
There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in previous WeChat and Lucky Money experience
between the two conditions (all p > .1). In both conditions, there were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the tie strength among the four fake participants according to scenarios (all
p > .05) and and in both sceneries, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the tie
strength in the two conditions (all p > .05). These results indicated that we could conduct
further analysis. In both conditions, the tie strength with close friends was higher than
the tie strength with strangers (high: t = − 18.236, p < .001; low: t = − 15.705, p < .
001); this suggested that participants had a correct understand of the interpersonal rela‐
tionships between the two scenarios.
4.3.2
Gifting Behaviors
We used non-parametric Mann-Whitney for the analyses of participant gifting behav‐
iors. In both scenario, participant gifting frequency in the high condition was higher than
the frequency in the low condition (both p < .05). In both scenarios, there were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in participant gifting amount between two conditions (both p > .

Conclusions
Based on a money gifting social game, this study investigated the eﬀects of group
participation on members’ gifting behaviors. For a general consideration of the eﬀects,
the experiment involved two group contexts in which individuals have diﬀerent inter‐
personal relationships with the group members. The two group contexts included a close
friend group context and a stranger group context. We conducted two studies to inves‐
tigate two aspects of gift exchange behaviors, including group participation ratio and
partners’ frequency of gifting. The results of Study 1 indicated people will participate
more in maintaining the relationships with a friend group in which more members
participate in the inter-group relationship maintaining but they will not invest more
resources. In a stranger group, other group members’ participation does not inﬂuence
people’s money gifting behaviors. Study 2 suggests that when the amount of money
involved in the gift exchange interaction is fairly small, interpersonal relationship is the
main inﬂuence on individuals’ gifting behavior; in contrast if the amount involved
exceed a certain threshold, reciprocal norms are a better predictor of individuals’ gifting
behaviors than tie strength. Friendships usually involve multiple forms of interaction in
addition to gifting and it is this multiplicity of interaction which gives friendships their
40

robustness. This means that even if a friend sends a low-value gift, individuals will
reciprocate a large-value gift or a favor of equivalent value. Because relationships with
strangers are more sensitive to reciprocal norms, individuals tend to respond rapidly to
an increase in the value of gifts; gifting to friends is more robust against changes in other
partners’ behavior, as noted above. When the amount of money involved in the inter‐
action reaches a certain threshold, however, tie strength has a less explicit (we did not
mean less important) inﬂuence on gifting behavior than reciprocal norms. The eﬀects
of tie strength on gifting behavior warrant further investigation. The two studies were
both conducted on a group-level factor and intragroup-level factors warrant further
investigation.

Abstract. In the last years, some studies about how cultural diﬀerences inﬂu‐
ences user experience (UX) have started being published. Most of these studies
concluded that cultural diﬀerences really aﬀect UX. These studies were conducted
in diﬀerent countries, using diﬀerent methods and led by researches with diﬀerent
cultures. Observing these points, the main objective of this review is to map the
work in this area and to suggest a research guideline for similar work. First, a
systematic literature review was conducted in the main academic search engines,
using many related keywords. The search engines returned 1227 studies and all
abstracts were read and evaluated according to the acceptance criteria. Twenty
three remaining studies were analyzed in detail. Results showed that the
Hofstede’s deﬁnition of culture and cultural diﬀerences is the most commonly
used deﬁnition in this area, most studies used questionnaires to evaluate if the
culture really inﬂuences UX and regarding the results, the majority, 87 %, conﬁrm
that it does. Based on this analysis, we identify and propose a guideline to replicate
this kind of work in other scenarios. This guideline may represent a signiﬁcant
contribution to the area, perhaps enabling an increase in the number and stand‐
ardization of certain cross-cultural studies, in the development of new techniques
and in the relevance of this subject during UX projects.

Introduction
In the last years, some studies about how cultural diﬀerences inﬂuences user experience
(UX) have started being published. Most of these studies concluded that cultural diﬀer‐
ences really aﬀect UX, whether in product development [1], systems such as internet
banking [2] or games [3]. These studies were conducted in diﬀerent countries, using
diﬀerent methods and led by researches with diﬀerent cultures. Observing these points,
the main objective of this review is to map the work in this area, listing the methods and
results around the world, and to suggest a research guideline for similar work.
A systematic literature review is a method to identify, evaluate and interpret all
relevant research available for a speciﬁc research question, subject area or phenomenon
of interest. The main reasons and advantages for conducting a systematic review are: to
summarize the information about a particular topic, ﬁnd gaps in subject areas or provide
a background to a study [4]. Therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted to
answer these following questions:

• How do the user experience studies deﬁne “cultural diﬀerence”?
• Which methods exist to assess whether cultural diﬀerences inﬂuence UX?
• What are the results of this type of study?
Based on the results, we identiﬁed and propose a guideline to replicate this kind of
work in other scenarios. This guideline may represent a signiﬁcant contribution to the
area, perhaps enabling an increase in the number and standardization of certain cross-
cultural studies, in the development of new techniques and in the relevance of this subject
during UX projects.

After reading the abstracts, the 45 accepted papers were classiﬁed into two catego‐
ries: type and media as shown in Table 3. The type category refers to the phase of the
product lifecycle in the cultural inﬂuence is analyzed: development, testing, ﬁnal user
experience or in research of new methods. The media category refers to which type of
interface was explored in the study.
We then decided to focus on the papers with the UX type. Among the 28 papers
included in this type, 5 were excluded because they were studying user experience with
objects instead of software, focusing on reliability instead of a broader deﬁnition of UX
or were a precursor study of a ﬁnal study already present in this review. Then the 23
remaining papers were analyzed fully [5–27].
In order to answer the ﬁrst research question, “How do the user experience studies
deﬁne cultural diﬀerence?”, we sought to examine how each study categorized the
culture of the participants and how it deﬁned this concept. As shown in Fig. 1, the work
of the anthropologist Hofstede [28] predominates as the basis of the deﬁnition of culture,
followed by the study Nisbett [29] with only three entries.
The Inﬂuences of Culture on User Experience
45

Fig. 1. Cultural diﬀerence deﬁnition models
The Hofstede perspective is methodologically advantageous to work that wishes to
map the behavior of cultural groups, especially highlighting the focus on measuring
cultural traits. Hofstede follow a particular line of thought in anthropology, according
to which there are generalizable cultural traits [30].
Although Hofstede’s analysis is based on cultural dimensions, the dimensions are
calculated by territories and, therefore, continue to use political divisions as part of its
foundation. Some studies [5, 7, 21] considered the birthplace and the time and place of
residence to set the culture of the individual, while other studies [13, 16, 23, 27] used
only the birthplace. It is understood that it is appropriate to analyze where the individual
lives, if the current reality has inﬂuenced the culture derived from the birthplace.
Then we analyzed the second research question “Which methods exist to assess
whether cultural diﬀerences inﬂuence UX?”. As shown in Fig. 2, the most widely used
method to evaluate the inﬂuence of cultural diﬀerences in user experience is the use of
questionnaires, followed by performance measurement in predeﬁned tasks.
Questionnaires play a key role in usability evaluation [31]. In the papers evaluated
in this review, questionnaires were very popular and used to identify the importance of

usability attributes, such as eﬀectiveness, eﬃciency and satisfaction, in ﬁnished products
[5, 6, 11, 24, 25] and to investigate the user experience [10, 14, 16–21, 26, 27]. Ques‐
tionnaires were also used in a less conventional way, in tests in which the user completed
sentences according to their understanding [22], in initial mapping of user culture [7,
8] and to recognize icons [23].
The second most used method, measuring performance in tasks, constitutes
successful evaluation in tasks in relation to time and/or amount of hits. This method,
used in some studies [7, 10, 13, 17, 18, 21, 26, 27], was conducted by asking users to
execute activities or perform tasks in diﬀerent interfaces to correlate the performance
of any given interface with the culture of a certain group.
The method of conducting interviews, used in some papers [8, 16, 26], is similar to
applying the questionnaire in relation to the purpose of raising the awareness of the user,
but adopting a personal interaction as a strategy to capture more information.
The last method listed, monitoring, analyzes the user experience through the capture
of user signals. In this set of papers there are two examples, the traditional eye-tracking
[16] that monitors eye movements and gaze direction in order to assess several factors,
including user satisfaction, and the less conventional FunToolKit [19], which analyzes
children’s facial expressions and smiles to measure satisfaction.
The higher number of evaluation methods in relation to the number of papers
occurred because some combined more than one method. Table 4 shows the combina‐
tions of methods were used.
Three of the papers included did not perform user experiments themselves [9, 12,
15], but based their conclusions only on literature reviews and annotations.
The third research question, “What is the result of the study?”, focuses on how many
studies have indicated that cultural differences impact on user experience and how many
got the opposite result. The vast majority of studies, 87 %, conclude that there is influence.

For a better analysis of this result, a comparative analysis of the papers follows,
highlighting some of the strengths and weaknesses in their methods and deﬁnitions, in
order to indicate which results inspire greater conﬁdence.
Among the 20 articles that claim that culture inﬂuences UX, three performed no
experiment [9, 12, 15] and three did not discuss which statistical methods were used [21,
26, 27]. All other studies conducted user experiments and showed the statistical methods
used, including the three that could not ﬁnd evidence of culture inﬂuencing UX.
Of the papers that performed experiments and showed their statistics, 16 adopted
young people such as students, trainees, gamers etc. as their target group. There is only
one exception [19], which used children as target audience. It is considered appropriate
to choose as target users of the same general age group, or to control for it, since age is
one of the factors that inﬂuences culture.
One study selected numerically equal groups of men and women [17]. This control
is important since gender may interfere with both culture and UX. The amount of target
audience for the studies varied within the range of 40 [7, 8, 19] to 5000 [22] participants.
Studies using online questionnaires had larger samples.
Among the papers that claim to have found signiﬁcant inﬂuence of culture in UX,
two stood out for demonstrating through the experiment that there was eﬀective perform‐
ance improvement in the activities when using the culturally appropriate interface [7,
13]. This type of analysis has high added value because it not only shows that the
performance diﬀers between cultures but also using a culturally appropriate interface
can improve both performance and UX.
These studies measured user experience and performance on tasks exposing the same
interfaces to groups with diﬀerent cultures and analyzed these measurements with stat‐
istical methods and methodologies typical of reliable research.
On the other hand, the two papers that claim to have found no inﬂuence [10, 18] may
present small methodological divergences. One of them [19] said the experiment was
inconclusive, but used a relatively small sample of young children as subjects in two
diﬀerent countries and with considerably diﬀerent sample sizes in each country, which
complicates data analysis. It also used the Fun Toolkit to measure satisfaction, along
with self-reported questionnaires (which may also be more problematic for children to
answer). Other two articles [10, 18] used a diﬀerent research procedure: instead of
subjecting users of diﬀerent cultures to the same interface, as most of the articles made,

they chose to show two signiﬁcantly diﬀerent user interfaces to users of a single culture,
and were then unable to detect any diﬀerence.

The Guideline
Based on the results and in the best practices adopted on the studies we analyzed, a guide‐
line was created to help researchers in future studies that aim to investigate whether
cultural differences between two or more specific groups are deep enough to affect user
experience.
The ﬁrst step is to choose the population to the study. It is recommended to choose
a population with very similar characteristics, in which only one factor inﬂuences
cultural diﬀerences, to minimize the interference of other factors (or one must be aware
of these other factors and control for them during data analysis). When analyzing diﬀer‐
ences in regional culture, for instance, which is a very common type of study, one should
attempt to choose people within the same ranges of age, income and education. Profes‐
sion (or general professional area) may also play a large role in culture, particularly in
aspects related to that profession, so it should also be as uniform as possible or controlled
for. Gender may or may not have an inﬂuence but since analyzing for a single gender is
usually undesirable, we recommend controlling for it, and choosing the same number
of men and women in each cultural group may also alleviate this problem. Finally, for
regional diﬀerences, it is interesting to conﬁrm that the study participants live in the
same region they were born and never lived for long periods in other regions to avoid
the adoption of other cultural traits.
The second step is to evaluate if the groups of the study really shows cultural diﬀer‐
ences. In the attempt to pick a population as uniform as possible aside from one factor
such as regional culture, one might end up picking from a group, such as “computer
science students aged between 20 and 25” which has its own more uniform subculture
that supplants the inﬂuence of other factors, such as where they live. To verify whether
the diﬀerent cultural groups in the population do show cultural diﬀerence, we recom‐
mend the use of Hofstede’s Values Survey Module [28], because it is methodologically
advantageous, giving clear, numerical results through the application of a questionnaire,
and easily replicable.
The third step is to choose the system or interface that will serve as a basis for the UX
evaluation. It is important to equalize or control for previous knowledge and experience with
the system, to avoid that users with more familiarity obtain results significantly different
compared to those that have no practice. Therefore, we recommend creating a new system
or interface if feasible, used only for the experiment, ensuring that all users will have no
familiarity with it, unless one wishes to test experienced users, in which case training before
the experiment may alleviate these differences in experience.
The fourth step is to choose the methods to evaluate the user experience and satis‐
faction about the system. We recommend the use of questionnaires and task performance
measurements, frequently used in studies analyzed in this review, as ways to get quan‐
titative results to compare. Standard questionnaires such as QUIS [32] or others could
The Inﬂuences of Culture on User Experience
49

be used, and are preferable since they have already been vetted by the research
community. If possible, we also recommend the application of some form of interview
to get further results and explanations, including qualitative results.
The ﬁfth step is to deﬁne the tasks to be measured. It is recommended to choose
diﬀerent system features and, in some of these, place some “traps” (i.e. instances where
uses may easily commit errors or purposefully ill-designed elements of interaction) to
analyze user reaction to these elements.
The sixth step is to deﬁne questions for the interview. Common options are asking
about what users liked best and liked least, what they would change in the interface and
letting them make general comments.
The seventh, and last, step is to apply the experiment and to compute the results. If the
VSM results and the UX tests results shows statistically significant difference between the
different cultural groups but statistically converge between the users of a same group, this
strongly suggests that the cultural differences between these groups is deep enough to
impact the UX. It is then possible to analyze which aspects of the experience differ mostly
between groups and to begin to understand and design for these differences.

Conclusion
Our goal was to map the work in this area, discussing the methods and results around
the world, and to suggest a research guideline for similar work.
Our results indicate that Hofstede has the most accepted deﬁnition of culture and his
method to calculate cultural diﬀerences using cultural dimensions is methodologically
advantageous, easily replicable and largely utilized in this kind of study.
Questionnaires and task performance measurements are the most used methods to
evaluate the UX in this kind of study.
Most of the studies analyzed on this review, 87 %, concluded that the cultural diﬀer‐
ences really aﬀects the UX.
To help researchers that want to replicate this kind of study in other groups of user
we elaborated a guideline with seven steps:
1. Choose the population
2. Evaluate cultural diﬀerences
3. Choose a new system/interface
4. Choose the methods to evaluate UX
5. Deﬁne the tasks
6. Deﬁne the interview questions
7. Apply the experiment and compute the results
We believe that culture is an important part of UX and, the more studies are
performed, the more techniques that account for culture in the UX process will evolve.
With this work, we contribute with futures studies by making experimental design less
complex with a guideline based on success studies.

Abstract. We consider culture as a concept and a concern that permeates the 5
HCI Grand Challenges identiﬁed in 2012 by the Brazilian HCI community, and
that should be understood and considered from a broad and systemic perspective.
In this sense, we conducted a workshop about cultural issues to investigate and
promote the topic in the HCI Brazilian community. In this paper, we present and
discuss some results from the workshop, highlighting as primary empirical
evidence the participants’ survey responses. The results allow us to develop a
panorama of how the Brazilian HCI community is interested in the subject of
culture understands and makes sense of the subject in their practices.

Introduction
We live in a globalized and constantly changing world where technology, culture,
society and nature are on a constant move. Thus, understanding the complex cultural
context in which people live is becoming increasingly critical and necessary in order to
clarify a problem and design a solution for it. However, one of the greatest challenges
to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners is to turn interfaces universally
accessible and usable, on one hand, and to respect and promote culture-determined
aspects of the user’s experience, on the other hand. Big companies all over the world
share this challenge and concern. Google, for instance, claims that “they are working
toward a web that includes everyone”, but recognizes that “they are still not where they
want to be when it comes to diversity” [12].
Over the years, cultural issues in technology design have been receiving attention
from the HCI community [7, 10]. In Brazil, speciﬁcally, diﬀerent research groups with
diﬀerent approaches have been working on artifacts, methods, tools, theoretical back‐
ground and models to incorporate cultural issues in the interaction design process
[11, 14–16, 20]. Salgado [17], for instance, has proposed a Semiotic Engineering
conceptual tool, namely, Cultural Viewpoint Metaphors (CVM) for guiding the design

of cross-cultural interactive systems. Gasparini et al. [10] presented a survey of cultural-
aware issues in HCI to establish background and some basic concepts for helping
designers incorporating cultural issues in HCI. Pereira and Baranauskas [14], in turn,
propose artifacts and methods for a value-oriented and culturally informed approach to
design, recognizing the cultural nature of values and favoring the identiﬁcation of rele‐
vant cultural aspects to the design context, process and stakeholders.
On the one hand, all the previously cited works have been focused on the importance
of including and understanding cultural issues in HCI. On the other hand, each research
group has adopted diﬀerent theoretical foundations and diﬀerent methodological frames
to conduct its research. This is due to at least two reasons: (i) Brazil is a multicultural
country with continental dimensions; (ii) the Brazilian HCI community has been
founded in diﬀerent approaches. In such a plural scenario, the key question is why just
a few researchers, in Brazil, explicitly recognize the cross-cultural nature of their
research.
In 2013, in a dataset composed by 236 full papers published in ﬁfteen years of the
Brazilian Symposium on Human Factors in Computer Science (namely “IHC”),
Gasparini and co-authors [11] found only 6 papers focused on cultural issues. In the
following year (2014), the same symposium (“IHC”) had just one full paper explicitly
focused on this theme. The “IHC” is the major HCI conference in Brazil and it is
supported by the HCI Special Interest Group of the Brazilian Computer Society. In the
same year and conference, we organized the ﬁrst Workshop on Cultural Aspects in HCI
(WCIHC) aimed at: (i) identifying challenges and interests about this theme by the
Brazilian community, (ii) sharing diﬀerent concepts, theories, methodologies and
knowledge, and (iii) raising the participants’ awareness to the importance and relevance
of the topic. The workshop was attended by 23 participants from 20 diﬀerent Brazilian
organizations (18 universities and 2 Information Technology companies). From the
participants, 8 are PhDs, 3 PhD candidates, 1 master, 7 graduates, and 3 undergraduate
students. The research question that motivated the workshop was: What are the Brazilian
community perspectives in Cultural aspects in HCI?
The workshop included diﬀerent activities, such as paper presentation session; prac‐
tical and participatory activity about design in a cultural critical context, focus groups,
and a ﬁnal discussion. In order to ﬁnd out the researchers’ proﬁle and background we
invited all the registered attendees to answer a pre-workshop survey. It aimed at
collecting evidence regarding: research activities, areas of concentration, research inter‐
ests in Culture and HCI, what the participants understand by culture and cultural issues
in HCI; previous experiences with cultural issues; and which cultural questions they
believe to be relevant.
In this paper, we present and discuss some results from the workshop, highlighting
as primary empirical evidence the survey responses. The results allow us to develop a
panorama of how the Brazilian HCI community is interested in the subject of culture,
understands and makes sense of the subject in their practices. Furthermore, we outline
what the Brazilian HCI community thinks of when culture plays a leading role in inter‐
action design.
This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the foundation and concepts
about culture and HCI. Section 3 details the workshop structure and dynamics.

Foundations and Concepts about Culture and HCI
Every technology triggers positive and/or negative impact on the environment in which
it is inserted and on the people that are living in it – even in a indirectly way. Winograd
[22] has stated that the task of designing interactive systems goes beyond building an
interface to cover all the “interspace” in which people live.
In fact, HCI ﬁeld needs to deal with universal issues and aspects that are also matter
of other (computing or not) areas and, at the same time, consider speciﬁc aspects of the
environment (e.g. cultural, social, economic, political, and geographic) in which the
application occurs. Several authors as Bannon [1], Baranauskas [4], Bødker [5], Sellen
and co-authors [19] claimed that the relationship between people with technology has
changed intensely in last years. Currently, interactive systems can be anywhere and used
anytime. These changes are profound enough to require a review of HCI ﬁeld, its theo‐
ries, methods and practices, and require consideration and explicit involvement of
cultural issues related to context in which technology is designed, disseminated, eval‐
uated and used.
Interactive systems need to support an increasing amount of materials and make them
accessible to diﬀerent populations Worldwide. A key challenge for the interaction
designer is to design, build and evaluate systems that understand the cultural diversity
of its stakeholders and answer a wide variety of needs and expectations.
Recently, the HCI Brazilian research community has developed an initiative to iden‐
tify Grand Research Challenges for HCI in Brazil for the next decade [3]. Five Grand
Challenges were presented: 1. The Future, Smart Cities and Sustainability; 2. Accessi‐
bility and Digital Inclusion; 3. Ubiquity, Multiple Devices and Tangibility; 4. Human
Values and 5. HCI Education and the Market. This initiative shows the need to under‐
stand, consider and deal with cultural issues when doing scientiﬁc research in HCI. More
than that, Salgado and colleagues aﬃrm that culture topic is crosses the 5 suggested
Great Challenges [18], requiring an understanding of Culture and an approach from a
broad and systemic perspective.
Most research on culture and HCI performed in the last 15–20 years has investigated
the impact of cultural diﬀerences on the users’ experience and aimed to deﬁne the
cultural issues in the HCI design process (de Souza et al. [8]; del Gado [9]; Vatrapu &
Suthers [21]). Other studies have proposed alternatives to the evaluation processes and
design to accommodate cultural factors in the conceptualization and construction of
multicultural systems interfaces (Barber & Badre [2]; Bourgues-Waldegg & Scrivener
[6]; Gasparini et al. [10]; Pereira & Baranauskas [13]). In addition, new research showed
interest in helping HCI professionals in developing multicultural systems that expose
and communicate cultural diversity (Salgado and co-authors [17]).
However, while the importance of dealing with cultural issues is obvious and is
often present in debates around the course of the HCI area, the treatments given to this
issue have been so far mostly fragmentary, guided by practical and speciﬁc problems

(e.g., the need to develop Web applications for an international and culturally diverse
audience). There is an urgent need to discuss and generate new knowledge that will
help HCI professionals to ﬁnd the necessary balance between cultural accessibility –
allowing users from one culture to use software produced by other cultures, and pres‐
ervation of cultural diversity – producing technology that respect, express and
strengthen the identity and cultural values (Salgado et al. [17]). Indeed, there is still a
lack of theoretically and methodologically informed work (artifacts, methods, tools,
examples, experiments) to support the understanding of cultural issues and its explicit
consideration in the technology design. The very notion of the meaning of culture, its
role in the HCI, and the existing theories and methods used must be put into perspective,
shared, reviewed and discussed.
Our initiative in this direction was to establish a place to discuss cultural issues in
the practices and research with HCI Brazilian community. For that to happen, we
proposed a workshop held jointly with the Brazilian Symposium on Human Factors in
Computer Science (“IHC”).

WCIHC: The Workshop on Cultural Aspects in HCI
In recent years, unwanted impacts of computer systems on economic, ethical, political
and social life have become more evident. Such kind of problems generally stem from
a software development vision that does not privilege the social world in which solutions
are used and people live, i.e., that ignore the complex cultural context of life. Therefore,
we argue that research and developments in twenty-ﬁrst century HCI must respond to
the cultural challenges brought about by globalized societies. There is an urgent need
to generate a body of knowledge that will help HCI designers to recognize the impor‐
tance of cultural issues in the design and evaluation of interactive technologies, reaching
a proper balance between cultural accessibility and the preservation of cultural diversity.
Indeed, the very understanding of culture, its role in the design of technology, the
existing theories and methods to deal with cultural issues are topics that need to be
discussed, disseminated and revisited. Therefore, the ﬁrst workshop WCIHC (acronyms
of I Workshop on Cultural issues in Human Computer Interaction) aimed at sharing
knowledge, experiences and practical results on the research undertaken by the HCI
community on this issue and discussing the cultural dimensions in Human-Computer
Interaction.
Because the WCIHC happened jointly with the “IHC” event, it had the potential to
promote a current discussion forum for the HCI community in Brazil, favoring not only
research in the Great Challenges context, but contributing to the development of
researches in line with the challenges of a society mediated by Information and Commu‐
nication Technologies.
The objectives of the WCIHC workshop were twofold: (a) Promote discussions,
share knowledge, experiences and concrete results of the research carried out on the
cultural dimensions in Human-Computer Interaction; and (b) Disseminate existing
research on the topic in the Brazilian community, stimulating the development of new
initiatives.
56
I. Gasparini et al.

People interested in participating with a paper submission were invited to submit a
paper, justifying their interest in the topic and describing experiences related to cultural
issues in HCI, including topics such as: Theories, methods, techniques for the design/
evaluation of interactive systems; Design and/or evaluation of multicultural systems;
Internationalization-Localization; Culture-Sensitive Design Process; Culture-sensitive
Interaction; Cultural accessibility; Cultural awareness; Cultural Diversity and its eﬀects
on HCI research; Cultural Perspectives on HCI; Usability, HCI and Culture; Adapting
the design and evaluation of interactive systems based on cultural issues; Cultural issues
in HCI education; Multi and intercultural Collaboration; Intercultural encounters in HCI.
Each submission was evaluated by two reviewers, and the criteria for selection
were: quality of data, arguments about the relevance of the topic, practical implica‐
tion of the results for HCI, and potential for promoting constructive discussions
during the workshop. Five papers were accepted for presentation and discussion at the
Workshop, related to: (1) Survey of cultural aspects in HCI Research; (2) Culture in
iDTV Projects; (3) Investigating the cultural aspects in the group formation of collab‐
orative learning; (4) Digital Inclusion in a Kaingang Community; and (5) The inves‐
tigation on elderly, games and motivation.
Among the ﬁve papers, the papers 1 and 2 provided general discussions on the
subject, and the papers 3, 4 and 5 showed more speciﬁc discussions, addressing speciﬁc
and local topics. The ﬁrst work presented a comprehensive literature review and contrib‐
utes to present an overview of some of the major works on the subject in the HCI. This
was especially important to place the participants in relation to the existing work and to
promote a common basis for discussion. The second work also presented a literature
review and contributed to propose a set of questions to support the identiﬁcation of
requirements related to cultural issues involved in a practical context. These issues were
important to promote critical thinking about cultural aspects and to show their direct
relationship with design requirements. The third work showed the importance and rele‐
vance of considering cultural issues when forming groups to promote collaborative
learning. This work contributed to relate culture with education, including questions
about its practical applications, and suggested an agenda on the issue. The fourth work
reported a direct experience of working with an indigenous tribe in southern Brazil,
contributing to the workshop by showing a reality of great cultural diﬀerence and to the
discussion of the methods and theories to be used to support the work in this kind of
context. Finally, the ﬁfth work highlighted the importance of understanding culture
when designing solutions to speciﬁc groups, but not restricted to them, promoting
discussions on the need to understand a speciﬁc user group, but located in a more
complex and comprehensive context.
Besides the call for papers, we invited all the participants of our workshop (both
presenters and the general audience) to answer a survey, before the workshop take
place, to discover how culture is understood by Brazilian HCI practitioners. The
workshop had 22 participants (researchers, masters and PhD students, industry
professionals engaged in HCI and interested in cultural issues) and all of them
answered the survey before the workshop.

The workshop was held on 27 October 2014, being organized as follows: Opening,
with a brief summary of the objectives and the presentation of the agenda; Oral Presen‐
tations and discussions of selected papers; Panel with the organizers; Practical activity
in groups; Discussion with the audience; and workshop closure. In the practical activity,
the participants were exposed to a problem situation and were invited to reﬂect on the
cultural issues involved in it. The activity intended to bring the discussions developed
at the workshop into a practical context, promoting the critical reasoning and inviting
the participants to think about real problems and the way they would deal with it.
The pre-WCIHC survey. The survey was available online for all the people who had
subscribed to the WCIHC. Initially, the survey explained its goals, and presented an
informed consent term. Only after this step people could answer the questions. The
survey was composed by personal and demographic questions (e.g., background, ﬁeld,
institutions of work and jobs, professional activities, topics of interest, research interest),
workshop expectations (e.g., what topics related to culture they would like to see in the
WCIHC, their expectations about the workshop) and their previous knowledge about
culture in HCI (e.g., information about their knowledge on the topic, what references
and authors they knew, what culture means for them, which cultural aspects did they
consider relevant in HCI study, as well as their previous experiences when dealing with
cultural issues in HCI). In the next section we present and discuss some results from
survey.

Preliminary Results
All the 22 participants answered the survey before attending to the workshop. The ﬁrst
set of questions was about the participant’s proﬁle. Most of them have some background
in computer science/informatics ﬁeld (academic education, e.g. undergrad or Master/
PhD; or teaches/researches in the ﬁeld), and one participant has academic education and
works in Arts. When asked about their institution (in the past 3 years), as all participants
are located in Brazil, only Brazilian’ institution (universities and research centers) were
described. The participants work in diﬀerent regions of the country (at least 1 participant
from each one of the 5 regions in Brazil). This is quite an interesting aspect, because
Brazil has continental proportions, each region has diﬀerent traditions and costumes,
and these cultural diﬀerences could be investigated and applied in HCI ﬁeld.
In relation to their research topics of interest, although all the participants research
in HCI in some extend, diﬀerent topics emerged. The main topics are presented in
Fig. 1, which highlights “Accessibility”, “Computers and Education”, and “Semiotic
Engineering”.
About the reasons that led them to enroll in the workshop, most of them (21) stated
that they have interest in Culture and HCI, and one participant want to know the topic.
Eight participants already research in the topic and six participants claimed they still do
not research on the topic but they want to start.
When asked which themes related to culture and HCI they would like to see
addressed in the WCIHC, there were diﬀerent suggestions: Ongoing research on the
subject in Brazil; systems evaluation focusing on culture; perception of cultural
58

diﬀerences (cultural awareness); cultural diversity and its eﬀects on research in HCI;
cultural perspectives on HCI; cultural identities, values, ethical issues, cultural acces‐
sibility and preservation of cultural diversity in HCI; research in the area of Online Social
Networks, where there are users from diﬀerent cultures and nationalities; privacy and
cultural issues; relation of Culture, Web and Mobile; Approach to virtual learning envi‐
ronments; Semiotics Engineering Evaluation Methods (e.g., MIS and MAC); Methods,
models and challenges to identify and realize cultural issues in system design; ethical
issues, implicit coding of cultural meanings in software artifacts; cultural reframing
software (can software produced and used in a primary culture change the meaning [and
use] in another culture?); Interdisciplinary Contributions to address cultural aspects;
Culture of Deaf people and its impact on the design of Universal User Interfaces; New
approaches and methodologies; Main cultural aspects that inﬂuence technological arti‐
facts; Analysis of cultural aspects in Collaborative Learning; Digital Aesthetics; and the
main inﬂuences of culture in teaching and learning context.
About the participants’ expectations related to the workshop, it is interesting to note
diﬀerent aspects, related to their research and to HCI community, such as: meet people
interested in the topic; know the current research; know theories and techniques of
culture in HCI; learn more about the topic; observe possible intersections of interest and
potential collaborators; gain experience in research and evaluation of multicultural
systems methodologies, as well as exchange experiences with others facing the same
research problems; contribution to improvement of their research; a comprehensive
insight into the cultural aspects in HCI, etc.
When asked to report their previous knowledge about cultural issues in HCI, a few
people stated having no knowledge about culture. Most of the participants have only
little contact with the theme, most from a lecture or reading some papers related to the
topic, and few people from a discipline in the ﬁeld. In relation to the main authors that
Fig. 1. Participants’ main topics of research
The Brazilian HCI Community Perspectives in Cultural Aspects in HCI
59

are frequently referenced in the literature related to cultural and HCI issues, we presented
a list of well-known authors in the ﬁeld and asked the participants to check the ones they
already knew. Figure 2 presents the cited authors.
Fig. 2. Cited authors
When we asked participants what is culture to them, the answers were diverse, but
all related to each other. Here we show 3 participant’s responses (translated by the
authors), with distinct ways of writing, probably related to their knowledge of the topic:
Participant 1: “Aspects of a society.”; Participant 2: “It is a set of conventions estab‐
lished over time in a community, inﬂuenced by factors such as tradition, laws, territories,
values etc.”; Participant 3: “A higher order signiﬁcation system which determines how
the expression and content from multiple lower order signiﬁcation systems used by one
or more social groups are associated with each other. It is my interpretation of the term
signifying order’ proposed by Danesi and Perron in the book that deals with culture in
a semiotic perspective.”
Finally, about the question “What cultural issues do you consider relevant for HCI
studies?”, the answers were varied: Cultural plurality questions; Microcultures; organ‐
izational culture; Language and behavioral diﬀerences; How countries deal with the lack
or excess of privacy; All the issues related to beliefs, values and customs of a group or
society, at the technical, formal and informal levels; All issues related to culture and its
implications in the interaction of people with the new technologies; Beliefs, habits,
values, customs; Accessible interfaces to language groups; Localization of interfaces;
diversity of aesthetic and logical paradigms; The formation of culture, cultural diversity
and how diﬀerent values can impact HCI; Styles of thought and communication, etc.
These answers indicate that Cultural issues are still a new topic to discuss in the Brazilian
community, which has diﬀerent interested, purposes and ways of understanding the role
of culture in HCI.

Final Remarks and Directions for Future Research
Nowadays we need to discuss the course of HCI area and to rethink the theories, methods
and practices adopted to support the design of computing solutions in a culturally
informed manner. It is a two-way road, once revisiting theories, practices and methods
60
I. Gasparini et al.

to become “culturally aware” will be useful, and even possible, only if the HCI
community changes its mindset, i.e., its culture of research and practice.
In fact, we need to understand and recognize that cultural aspects directly inﬂuence
how an interactive system is created, perceived, understood and used. The lack of
understanding and knowledge about the need for considering cultural diﬀerences in HCI
has led to the design of products that do not meet the demands of their users, do not
make sense, and that often cause unwanted impacts on the environment in which they
are available and on the diverse stakeholders.
The WCIHC was an initiative to promoting such discussion in the HCI Brazilian
community, highlight the importance of cultural issues in HCI research, and promoting
the exchange of experiences and practices between the participants. The initial results
from this workshop suggested that our community is diverse, and that although many
participants do not consider (or do it at a minimum level) cultural issues in HCI research
and practices, they are aware of their importance, and prone to advance in this direction.
For that, background material, examples of practices and further discussions to under‐
stand concepts, share experiences, practices, challenges, and practical problems are
welcome and necessary. We hope this is initiative to be the ﬁrst step to more people to
get involved on the topic.

Abstract. In order to design tactile devices for technologically mediated
communication, we investigated what tactile and gestural interactions would be
spontaneously used for sharing emotions in mediated communication. In an
experiment with 40 participants, we identiﬁed relations between hand gestures
performed with a concept device and emotions that a “sender” intends to convey
to a “receiver”. Among others, our results show that squeezing and shaking are
the most popular chosen hand gesture interaction. Gesture intensity and speed
follow the arousal (intensity) and temperature follows the valence (pleasure).
Emotions that subjects are most are willing to share with such a tactile are grat‐
itude, love, happy, sad, astonished, excited, angry and worried.

Emotions and Tactile Communication
A number of communication devices have been designed to explore tactile interactions
in communication [Picard 1997], as ComTouch [Chang et al. 2002], Hand Data Glove
[Piyush et al. 2012], a vibro-tactile device [Rantala et al. 2013], a mid-air haptic device
[Obrist et al. 2015]. A comprehensive review of 143 communication devices for medi‐
ating intimate relationships, which includes touch-based devices, has been reported by
[Hassenzahl et al. 2012]. Indeed, it has been shown that touch is an eﬀective way to
communicate emotions [Hertenstein et al. 2006, 2009]. From a biological point of view,
there is some evidence that touch triggers the release of oxytocin hormone, which
decreases stress [Uvnas-Moberg and Petersson 2005]. In this context, our goal is to ﬁnd
a systematic way to design touch-based long-distance communication devices. More
speciﬁcally we aim at identifying correlations between tactile interactions and emotions
that are felt by the users of such a device.
In all aforementioned studies, the participants were people from one single cultural
background. In a study by Nummenmaa et al. [2013], the focus was on the diﬀerences
between cultures. The authors proposed maps of bodily sensations associated with
diﬀerent emotions and they did not observe any diﬀerences between European and East
Asian subjects. They concluded that emotions were represented in the somatosensory
system as culturally universal categorical somatotopic maps. With a similar approach
applied to technologically mediated communication, our study aims at identifying

diﬀerences between two groups of people, Japanese and French, in the way the would
use such a tactile device for mediated communication.
In this study, we speciﬁcally focus the gestures of a sender who is willing to share
emotions with another person, through a handheld technological device, as described in
Fig. 1. Thus we conducted an experiment to identify the characteristics of such hand
gestures and analyzed the results with a special focus on the diﬀerences between the
Japanese participants and the French participants.

Experiment
Participants. 40 people participated in the experiment, half were French nationals, the
other half Japanese nationals, aged 21 to 37 years (M = 24.9). In both groups, around
half of the subjects were female subjects.
Procedure. In an individual one-hour session, the participants received a list of 35
emotions extracted from [Paltoglou et al. 2013], an extended version of the Circumplex
Model of Emotion [Russell 1980]. Three interpersonal emotions, gratitude, love and
sympathy, were added to the list, as in [Obrist et al. 2015]. For each emotion, the subjects
were individually asked to perform one hand gesture that they thought was the best way
to communicate the given emotion and to describe the properties of the gesture they
64
L. Haritaipan and C. Mougenot

performed: type of gesture, intensity (5-point Likert scale), speed (5-point Likert scale),
temperature that they would like the receiver to feel (cold /neutral /hot). The participants
were also asked to select the emotions they would like to be able to communicate with
a tactile long-distance emotional communication device.
Data Analysis. Data were analyzed with SPSS software, two-way between-groups
ANOVA and Fisher’s test, and in some cases independent samples t-test.

Results
Types of Gesture. The most chosen gestures are mapped on the Circumplex Model of
Emotions, with percentage of subjects who chose the gesture (Fig. 3). The most popular
gestural interactions are squeezing, for intense emotions, and shaking, for pleasant
emotions. Fisher’s Exact Probability Test is used for comparing the diﬀerences between
nationalities. French and Japanese subjects have diﬀerences in choosing gesture types
for 6 out of 35 emotions: bored, determined, disgusted, frustrated, pleased and sleepy.

Gesture Intensity. Gesture intensity tends to follow the arousal (intensity), gesture
intensity increasing with the emotion intensity. There is a nationality eﬀect in 7 out of
35 emotions: astonished, bored, compassionate, frustrated, hopeful, sympathy, and
worried. Between Japanese and French subjects, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
gesture intensity for only astonished emotion t(38) = 2.77, p = .01.
Gesture Speed. Gesture speed tends to follow the arousal (intensity), speed increasing
with the intensity. Between Japanese and French subjects, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀer‐
ence for ‘determined’: t(38) = −2.58, p = .01, and ‘excited’: t(38) = −2.18, p = .04.
Temperature. Temperature tends to follow the valence (pleasure), with high temper‐
ature chosen for pleasant emotions and low temperature for unpleasant emotions.
Between Japanese and French subjects, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in gesture
speed for embarrassed t(38) = 4.04, p = .00, two-tailed), and sympathy t(38) = −4.64,
p = .00, two-tailed).

Emotions which participants are “willing to share”. Emotions in Fig. 5 are listed
from most “willing to share” to least “willing to share” (counted from the total frequency
of all subjects). Love, gratitude, and happy are emotions that participants are most
“willing to share”, while alarmed, determined, and miserable are emotions that partici‐
pants are least “willing to share”. The emotions that were most chosen by Japanese
subjects were gratitude, happy, love, while French subjects chose: angry, excited, love.
Japanese subjects want to share alarmed, glad, and sleepy signiﬁcantly more than French
subjects, but compassionate and disappointed signiﬁcantly less than French subjects.

Discussion
We identiﬁed relations between tactile interactions chosen by a user of a touch-based
communication device and the emotion that the person intends to convey. Gesture
intensity and speed tend to follow the arousal (intensity). Temperature tends to follow
the valence (pleasure). As for the type of gestures, ‘squeezing’ is chosen for emotions
with positive intensity level; ‘shaking’ for emotions with positive pleasant level;
‘tossing’ for extreme pleasant and/or intense emotions.
Fig. 6. Most popular gestures chosen for expressing given emotions with a tactile device
Although the sample of participants was somewhat limited, we could identify some
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between people with diﬀerent cultural backgrounds, i.e. Japan
and France in this study. Emotions like astonished, determined, excited, embarrassed,
sympathy were express in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent gestures (intensity, speed and temper‐
ature) by Japanese and French subjects. We also identiﬁed diﬀerences in the emotions
that participants were willing to share with a ‘receiver’. Gratitude, love, happy, sad,
astonished, excited, angry, worried, delighted, interested, glad, and tired are emotions
that more than 50 % of subjects would like to be able to share. Interestingly, Japanese
subjects mostly chose gratitude, happy and love, while French subjects chose angry,
excited and love.
5
Conclusion
Our study allows identifying which hand gestures (types, intensity, speed, and temper‐
ature) would be most intuitively used for expressing given patterns of emotions when
using a device for mediated long-distance communication. We found some signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the Japanese subjects and the French subjects, especially in the
selection of emotions that people are willing to share with a tactile communication
device. The ﬁndings can inform the design of future tactile communication devices.

Abstract. This research explores emotional relationship between individual
among diﬀerent ages and their virtual possessions. We conducted 24 in-depth
interviews with younger adults (under 20-year-old) and elder adults (above 40-
year-old) in Taiwan. Data were collected and analyzed following grounded theory
coding method. By understanding usage behaviors and feelings about partici‐
pants’ important virtual possessions, we induced several diﬀerences of virtual
possession attachment among diﬀerent ages. We concluded four types of virtual
possession, the causes of attachment development and usage behaviors among
diﬀerent ages. Finally, several similarities and dissimilarities between elder and
young adults were discussed. Some guidelines of designing for improving virtual
possession attachment for people in these two generations are proposed.

Introduction
We are surrounded by an enormous amount of objects in everyday life. As technology
developing, the relationship between objects and us has become more and more compli‐
cated [1]. The interaction between an individual and his/her objects has not only involved
functionality but also the perception and the entire context. In this regards, Bowlby [2]
addressed the Attachment Theory, describing an emotional-laden target-speciﬁc bond
between two persons. This concept has been echoed with studies in various ﬁelds,
opening a novel perspective toward how we interact and develop relationship with our
objects [3–6].
To date, we have increasingly acquired virtual objects in our daily life. New types
of virtual objects have not only change our behavior and perception but also change the
whole experience. New experience such as reading electronic books and playing video
games that we may not even imagine in the past are possibly gained nowadays.
Researchers in various domains have gradually focus attention on the relationship
between human and their virtual possessions [7, 8]. However, rarely has researchers
investigated how individual develop emotional relationship with their virtual posses‐
sions.
The attachment development to virtual possessions is based on how individual
perceive their virtual possessions. Hence, there are many inﬂuencing factors of it.

Although Klein and Baker [9] had claimed that material possession attachment is a
dynamic concept and might be inﬂuenced by age and gender, it might be diﬀerent on
virtual possession attachment. Odom (2011) investigated how teenagers preserve their
virtual possessions and addressed several issues that are diﬀerent from the material
possessions [8]. Also, Cushing found age has an eﬀect on some diﬀerences to her ﬁnd‐
ings of personal digital information preservation [10]. Therefore, for getting better
understanding of attachment to virtual possessions, it is necessary for us to learn how
people in diﬀerent age develop the emotional relationship to virtual possession.

Background and Related Works
In the following section we reviewed the background to the questions addressed in this
article, including self-extension and attachment to virtual possession, virtual possession
usage among diﬀerent age, and related HCI researches.
2.1
Self-Extension and Attachment to Virtual Possession
Belk (1988) claimed that people are able to develop certain self-extension to their mate‐
rial possessions and feel attachment to them [11]. He proposed that self-extension is a
perception that people transfer their personal identity to their possessions and consider
the possessions could stand for their representation in the world. Therefore, we always
feel a sense of losing ourselves when we accidentally loss our treasured possessions.
For this reason, possessions seem to have stronger relationship than ordinary products
with individuals [11, 12]. Hence, in this study we focused on the emotional relationship
to possessions instead of products. On that account, self-extension would be a vital factor
when we explored the relationship.
As we acquiring more and more virtual possessions nowadays, the issue of how we
consider virtual objects has become important. Cushing (2012) addressed four charac‐
teristics of digital possessions and claimed that digital objects could be able to be
considered as a possession [10]. However, as we know the characteristics of virtual
possessions are very diﬀerent from physical ones, the virtual attachments with individual
may be also diﬀerent. Belk (2013) updated his theory of self-extension, presenting the
diﬀerences of extended self in digital world. He reviewed the relevance studies and
claimed that people indeed extend their selves to virtual possession [13]. However, there
are some slightly diﬀerences between them. As a conclusion, the notion of “attachment
to virtual possession” here is yet a complicated concept and has various characteristics.
Belk’s self-extension is one of the characteristics of the attachment to virtual possession
and will continually need to be improved.
2.2
The Usage of Virtual Possessions Among Diﬀerent Ages
Based on the literature, age may be a factor inﬂuencing self-extension and attachment
to virtual possessions [10, 13], Thus, we refer the theory Digital Native and Digital
Immigrant for our theoretical sampling.
The Diﬀerent Attachment to Virtual Possession
71

The concept of digital natives and immigrants was proposed by Prensky [14], an
American education consultant, investigated two types of generations to explain the gap
between American teachers and their modern students. The Digital Native was deﬁned
as people who were born after the existence of digital technologies. They are familiar
with technology and have diﬀerent brain activities when they are using digital device.
On the contrary, Digital Immigrants are those people who born before the existence of
digital technologies and adopted it to some extent later in life. In Prensky’s article, there
are many diﬀerences between these two generations. For example, instead of digital
books, Digital Immigrants still prefer material books although they also use Internet.
Digital Natives are used to interact with people and search information on Internet. The
diﬀerent attitudes of these two generations may inﬂuence how they consider and
preserve their virtual possessions. Therefore, in this study, both Digital Natives and
Digital Immigrants were included in sampling so as to investigate the diﬀerence between
people in diﬀerent ages. Nevertheless, the exact age boundary between these two gener‐
ations was not clearly deﬁned in Prensky’s research. But, children born after 1980 was
later applied as Digital Native because computer bulletin board systems and Usenet has
already been in use at the time.
However, in this study, because the diﬀerent technology development of Eastern and
Western culture, we considered 1985, ﬁve yeas later than America, as our boundary of
Digital natives and Digital immigrants. Moreover, in order to distinguish the diﬀerences,
we tried to increase the gap between these two generations by adding and cutting ten
years of them. Consequently, the two generations of participants in this study were
participants who are elder than 40 years old and participants who are younger than 20
years old.

Method
Our goal is to explore the emotional relationship between individuals and their virtual
possessions among diﬀerent ages by Grounded Theory. Figure 1 shows the process of
this research [15].
Fig. 1. Research process of this study
3.1
Data Collection
The study conducted 24 in-depth interviews with younger adults (13–20 years old; coded
as capital Y) and elder adults (40–51 years old; coded as capital E). Participants were
all Taiwanese and the gender was selected equally. All participants were recruited from
Internet. People were asked to ﬁll a prescreen questionnaire to make sure their qualiﬁ‐
cation in this study. Eventually, 24 participants were selected. Emails were sent to
schedule in person interview with the researcher. Every participant was oﬀered 300NTD

and a MUJI notebook. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Field notes
and photos were taken when necessary during the interview. Participants could choose
their preferred interview places as long as they are quiet enough for audio recording.
Therefore, most of interviews were conducted in public café or restaurant. Five of them
were conducted in participants’ home and work place. The interviews were conducted
in semi-structure and approximately 1.5 to 2 h. Participants were encouraged to bring
and share their virtual possessions while answering the questions.
3.2
Data Analysis
All vocal data from the interview were transferred into transcripts in order to be analyzed
by coders. There were three stages in data analyzing: open coding, axial coding and
selective coding. First, the interview data were labeled by a code team with open coding
process. The code team consisted of three graduate students from diﬀerent backgrounds
and the ﬁrst author. All data were reviewed and discussed by coders repeatedly so as to
be more objective.

Findings
4.1
Four Types of Possession
Based on the characteristics of possessions, we classiﬁed virtual possessions into four
types: valuable memory, personal creation, collectible and utility item. A virtual posses‐
sion might be classiﬁed into more than one type. For example, digital photos could
simultaneously be a valuable memory and a personal creation. For instance, Participant
E09 and Y12 regarded their digital photos both as record and creation. Therefore, we
will focus on the type of possessions in the following discussion, instead of each single
possession that was mentioned in the interview.
Type 1: Valuable Memory
Almost all participants indicated that their “most important virtual possession”
contains valuable memories. Among our participants, such virtual possessions included
digital photos, messages and records in videogames.
Figure 2 shows mostly digital photos are attached to elder participants and chat logs
and screenshots are attached to young participants in this study. Although the posses‐
sions are distinct, the main reason of attachment is similar: the valuable memories
contained in the possessions are mostly about their treasured signiﬁcant others, feelings
and events.
Type 2: Personal Creation
Personal creations and works such as Facebook posts, personal writings and photo‐
graphs were categorized into this type. Most possessions in this type were from elder
participants. All elder participants presented certain ability and passion of creating
something to manifest their personality. Figure 3 shows only elder participants attach
to their Facebook posts and writings and both elder and young participants attach to their
photographs. To clarify, photograph here is regarded as personal creation instead of
valuable memories in the previous section.

73

Fig. 3. Relationship between participants and their personal creations
Type 3: Collectible
Collectible is deﬁned as a set of perceived valuable items that are collected by an
individual including music collections and pictures of a speciﬁc idol. Figure 4 shows all
possessions in this type were from young participants. Young participants collected
virtual objects that they are interested in and keep them in a good order. They expressed
that those collectibles can not only inspire and encourage them to become who they want
to be but also help them feel a sense of belonging.
Fig. 4. Relationship between participants and their collectibles
Type 4: Utility Item
Items collected for some functional purposes were categorized into this type, such
as screenshots and bookmarks of useful information. Also, some social interaction
records by screenshots and embarrassing photos of friends, which used as social tools
for teenagers, were also classiﬁed into this type.

Figure 5 illustrate both elder and young participants attach to their screenshots. Only
one elder participant shared attachment to her bookmarks and the other one young
participant expressed her attachment to a speciﬁc video application on her iPod. People
preserve this type of possessions because they want to prepare for their future needs.
Fig. 5. Relationship between participants and their utility items
4.2
Usage Behavior
We observed four major usage behaviors in our data. We introduce each of them and
presented some similarities and dissimilarities between two age groups in the following
section.
Creating a Controllable Place to Preserve the Possessions. We observed all of the
participants have tried to create a controllable and safe place for preserving their posses‐
sion. However, there are still some diﬀerences between diﬀerent ages.
(1) Elder participants: backup and duplicate in multiple places
This phenomenon was found mostly in elder participants who have preserved their
digital photos for at least 8 years. They all preserve the photos in good order and
duplicate them in multiple places such as Cloud and portable hard-drive. “These
are gradually… I always feel they are important to me, so I keep looking for better
places to preserve them. To avoid losing them” (E10). On the contrary, surprisingly,
young participants in this study seldom backup their possessions. It seems that they
are very unfamiliar with the digital technology. Several young participants
expressed that they even do not know how to import information from their mobile
to desktop. Some of them revealed they would love to do the backup if they had
had the ability. “I don’t preserve them (chat logs) on purpose. But I don’t delete
them on purpose, either. Because it (Facebook) doesn’t provide the function… If I
had choice, I would love to do that” (Y02).
(2) Young participant: mobile phone is the safest place
Several young participants expounded that persevering all the virtual possessions
on their mobile phone and carrying it with them everywhere can make them feel
safe and convenient. On the contrary, several elder participants preserve their
possessions on Cloud. However, none of them take Could as the safe place for the
preservation. Participant E08 and E10 preserve their photo on Cloud in good order.
They both expressed that accessibility is the main purpose to preserve photos on
Cloud. “I can look for the photo by application easily if I need to share to others”
The Diﬀerent Attachment to Virtual Possession
75

(E10). For these participants, everywhere in digital world is temporary for them.
They believe the digital world is always changeful and insecure.
The Frequency of Reviewing and Organizing. In this study, our elder participants
usually organize their possessions very well but seldom review. On the contrary, young
participants seldom organize their possessions but review them a lot. Elder participants
such as E02, E08 and E10 sort their digital photos ﬁles by date and event. “I will name
ﬁles as some interesting titles related to the events” (E08). Also, they disclosed that they
barely have time to review them since they need to work and raise families at the same
time. As E07 said, “I seldom review them. I am busy for ﬁghting for my life recently
(Laughing)”. Therefore, in these cases, reviewing behavior always occurs with organ‐
izing and sharing. Elder participants seldom review the possessions simply because they
do not eager to review. “I can review them when I am home. It’s not urgent. I believe
they (the digital photos) will stay there stably and will not disappear” (E02). However,
there are still a few elder participants review their possessions very often. For example,
participant E01 and E06 who publish their works on social media seem to review more
frequently than the others. On the contrary, young participants review their possession
very often. Since they have more spare time than elder participants, reviewing the
important possessions becomes a relaxation and recreation in their daily life. They
review the possessions when they have spare time or when they think of speciﬁc people
and events. They usually review photos on mobile phone which they can access anytime,
and anywhere.
Present Their Selves by Sharing. This study shows that elder participants enjoy share
their selves in a digital environment and younger participants tend to share diﬀerent
selves in diﬀerent digital environment. Elder participants share the possessions as
spreading their thoughts to others. E06 considers his Facebook page as a platform
spreading the positive thinking. “I would like to share my positive power to everyone.
I hope people would like to follow this (Facebook posts with his wife)…and it might help
people to improve their relationship”. Moreover, E07 shared her creations related to
social issues and hopes they will have some slight inﬂuences to society. Both of them
mentioned that they know they have followers on Facebook. It seems that this situation
make them feeling inﬂuential. Also, they care about the comments and responses of their
posts. As E01 said, “It is boring if you posted something and there is no response. You
make people satisﬁed and you feel satisﬁed too. This is the meaning of sharing.” Even
some participants would plan their activities for sharing. “Sometimes it is like …we go
out in order to create new post” (E06). For young participants, they tend to separate the
content on diﬀerent platform in order to share to diﬀerent audiences. Sometime they
even do not use their real name on Internet. “Because I can share to everyone on
YouTube. Sharing to strangers… I create a ﬁctitious name so people would not know
that is me” (Y14).

Conclusion and Design Guidelines
This study explores attachment between individuals and their virtual possession among
young and elder adults in Taiwan. We found people in diﬀerent generations use and
attach to their virtual possessions diﬀerently. The diﬀerent backgrounds of generations,
such as technology knowledge and personal values of the diﬀerent generations, result
in the diﬀerent virtual possession attachment found in this study. Also, the type of virtual
possessions could also result in the diﬀerence. Therefore, in order to customize digital
service and virtual possession for diﬀerent generations, the background of participants
and the type of virtual possessions need to be concerned in the future design process.
Here, we proposed several design guidelines for designing attachment to virtual posses‐
sions among diﬀerent age.
For all users, consider the attribute (type) of virtual possession that user attaches to
and create a controllable space for him/her to preserve it when designing virtual posses‐
sion with attachment. For young users, consider the function of reviewing and selected
sharing. Contrarily, for elder users, consider the function of organizing and public
sharing. However, personal value and technology knowledge should be considered
while designing attachment to virtual possessions for both generations.
Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of attachment development to
virtual possessions among diﬀerent ages. As noted, virtual possession attachment is a
complicated concept and its inﬂuencing factors are interrelated. Therefore, in future
work, more factors should be discussed together in order to understand the whole picture
of attachment development to virtual possessions.

Abstract. In the era of social networking and computing, things and people are
more and more interconnected, giving rise to not only new opportunities but also
new challenges in designing new products that are networked, and services that
are adaptive to their human users and context aware in their physical and social
environments. A research vision on social things is needed, that addresses both
the technological and social aspects in design, and that requires a social approach
to the Internet of Things.
Keywords: Social things · Internet of things · Social computing · Design research

Introduction
In the concept of Internet of Things, things start to communicate with other things,
forming an “Internet of Social Things”, allowing things to have their own social
networks, enabled by communication technologies that are both ﬁxed and ad hoc, and
both wired and wireless. These “Internet of Social things” are further in connection with
their environments and users through sensors and actuators, communicating with the
social networks of humans, interacting in social networks with humans and other objects,
forming a “Social Internet of Things”. These two levels of social networks of things and
humans give rise to not only new opportunities but also new challenges in designing
new products (that are networked) and services (that are adaptive to their human users
and context aware in their physical and social environments). Therefore, the design
research to meet these new opportunities and challenges needs a social approach to the
Internet of Things, which brings our attention to a research area, namely “social things”,
that address both the technological and social aspects of the Internet of Things.

Social Things
2.1
Social Things for Data Driven and Service Centric Design
The merge of the social networks of people and the Internet of things leads to a shift
from product or system oriented design to service centric design. Systems, products and
the related services are more connected than ever. Products have become the terminals
of the services and systems have become the platforms to deliver the services. Social
computing started in late 1990’s and early 2000’s serving as platforms not only for

sharing online content and conversation, but also for processing the content of social
interaction and feeding back into systems [1]. The diﬀerence is that the social interaction
and feedback are tied to things, sensors, and information intertwined in the social chan‐
nels. These channels create touch points between services and customers, and the feed‐
back from the customers to the services has become quicker, driven by a more ﬂattened
and bottom-up social structure. Along with this development, products with embedded
connectivity and identiﬁcation technologies have become part of the Internet of Things,
and with embedded sensing technology these products have been integrated into
people’s lives in a more adaptive and social manner, learning human activities and
behavior from the big data in the networks of both humans and things. Figure 1 shows
an in-ﬂight entertainment system that collects not only the music preference of the
passenger, social recommendations of the music, but also the heart rate to detect the
stress level and to reduce it through adaptive music [2].
Fig. 1. Heart rate controlled music recommendation for low stress air travel [2]
With the facilitation of social things, service design can be carried out in an inter‐
active and sustainable process. In this process data and input can be collected social
interaction among the users; and the stakeholders and from the behavior of the users and
the products, analyzed and quickly or directly fed back to the process. The quicker this
feedback loop is, the more the design cost can be reduced. This research area needs to
investigate how to tightly combine and coordinate these computational, physical and
social elements to facilitate the service and the design process of it. Traditional new
product design and development methods become insuﬃcient when dealing with the
shift towards service centric design, the power from the ﬂattened and bottom-up social
structure, and the complexity of the social systems of humans and things. Adaptivity of
the intelligent systems and services has to be reinvestigated in the context of social things
and social innovation in a larger scale eco-system in which the social networks of people
and the Internet of things are intertwined.
2.2
Social Things for Social Innovation
The growth and development of distributed and pervasive computing, social networks
and mobile technologies have dramatically increased the complexity of the systems,
products and the related services, but also the complexity of the design itself. Social
things that merge the social networks of humans and the Internet of things, on the other
80
J. Hu

hand, brings up new solutions against the complexity, towards social innovation, by
harvesting the collective intelligence from the social networks of humans, including the
designers, the users and the organizations, and the collective intelligence from the
Internet of Things, in order to realize greater value from the interaction between people
and things, which in turn, inventing innovative and hopefully also sustainable ways of
living. In this context, design has become a social activity – design is a result of social
innovation; design drives social innovation and leads social transformation.
In this context, the design research on social things aims at developing methods,
tools and techniques to support design as social innovation and design for social inno‐
vation. In the case of design as social innovation, the research should investigate how
social things can be used to support the collaborative design activities by the designers
as well as other stakeholders including the end users and to enable collective creativity
and intelligence in dealing with the complexity of the systems of today. In this case open
source hardware and software are good examples of today (Fig. 2), but more can be
expected to happen to other end user products and systems. In the case of design for
social innovation, the research shall investigate how to use social things for design to
trigger and support social innovation that leads to societal transformations, by intro‐
ducing design perspectives and design intervention in a social context. The penetrating
of social things to the society creates possibilities in creating collective awareness plat‐
forms for possible solutions that need collective eﬀorts and shared knowledge, enabling
new forms of social innovation.
Fig. 2. Open data from internet of things, accessible using open source software tools
2.3
Social Things as “Simulation” Platforms for Design
The integration of the networks of humans and things gives the opportunity to bring
design much closer to the end users, to other stakeholders and to its social and situational
context, and vice versa. It sheds a promising amount of lights on improving the validation
process of design, as computational simulation has done to electrical and mechanical
engineering when computer was introduced to these disciplines.
Social things have their physical forms, but also can be easily captured and repre‐
sented in digital means. It enables them to be used for validating design in earlier phases
of the process. It is interesting to investigate how social things could be utilized as
“simulation” platforms for earlier concepts – in this case physical prototypes might still
be necessary but the situational context (people, other things and the environment) can
Social Things: Design Research on Social Computing
81

be brought in or closer in order to quest the concept earlier (Fig. 3 shows a project in
which the early concepts of a physical clock was evaluated with potential users in a
virtual world [3]).
Fig. 3. Digital model of a physical clock is evaluated in a virtual world [3]
2.4
Social Things as a Competency and as a Tool in Design Education
New types of designers have to be equipped with systematic understanding and perspec‐
tives, be competent in utilizing the social things to harvest the creativity, the input and
the feedback through social interaction. The developments also bring up new opportu‐
nities in utilizing social things in facilitating the learning to make learning a more
eﬀective and more enjoyable social experience. Figure 4 shows a set of open source
software, hardware and learning environment used in the design education at the depart‐
ment of industrial design, Eindhoven University of Technology.
Fig. 4. Open source software, hardware and learning environment in a design education [4]
The perspective and the ability of utilizing social things as an enabler in design should
be implemented in the design education. This research area should investigate how this
can be carried out in a self-driven learning process, and how to utilize the social things
and social computing technologies to facilitate this process.
2.5
Research Methods
Social things as a research topic is at the intersection of computational systems and social
behavior. This research should employ engineering and empirical research methodolo‐
gies, or a research-through-design approach, depending on the subject under investiga‐
tion.
Social things can be used to empower end-users, for example in the medical ﬁeld,
where patients get faster and more accurate information about their personal health
82
J. Hu

status, exchange experiences, and keep track of the performance of medical institutions.
The research question is how to design such social systems, and how to measure their
performance, which includes the perceived quality. The measurement instruments them‐
selves can be designed as social tools (on-line questionnaires, data logging with the
social things, network-oriented data visualization, distributed data mining, and crowd
wisdom).
Not only the end-users will change their way of working, also the design community
itself will change when adopting the power of social things and social computing. The
eﬀect is already visible in the communities around Arduino, Processing, and DIY 3D
printers. Whereas most of the present-day tools are still traditional editors, compilers
and CAD tools, the next generation of tools will be designed as social tools. This asks
for a research-through-design approach: creating new tools, co-creating and sharing
them inside the design community, and evaluate their performance and perceived quality
with appropriately designed new tools. State-of-the-art engineering and design methods
should be deployed to bootstrap the design of these new tools.
3
Research Areas and Activities
With the above mentioned research vision, we have been involved in a number of
research projects in related areas. “Social things” as a research area is broad, as seen
from the examples to be introduced next. It is not our intention to give a complete
overview here, rather it is to demonstrate our eﬀort in its two-fold focus on both tech‐
nological and social aspects.
3.1
Social Things to Connect the Digital and the Physical
Social things can be utilized to connect the digital and the physical, employing and
developing computational technologies such as distributed multimedia and interaction
for entertainment in ambient intelligent environments [5–7], semantic web for intero‐
perability of smart objects in intelligent environments [8–10], augmented and mixed
reality for installations in social and cultural computing [11–14], virtual reality for
serious games as learning or diagnostic tools [12, 15, 16] (Fig. 5 shows an augmented
home that integrates a digital game with the physical environment), tangible interfaces
Fig. 5. Augmented home: integrating a virtual world game in a physical environment [12]

83

to digital systems [9, 17, 18]. All these research activates have been engaging sensing
and actuating technologies, or embedded technologies that integrate both for an inte‐
grated system that merges and blurs the digital and the physical.
3.2
Social Things for Health and Care
Sensors, actuators, smart objects and integrated systems have been utilized in several
projects in delivery simulators for medical training [19, 20], comfort and bonding in
perinatology research [21], reducing stress in long haul ﬂights [2, 22], emotional care
for elderly with dementia [23, 24], social connectedness through unconscious and
peripheral data [25, 26] (Fig. 6), and relaxation with bio-feedback [27–29]. In recent
years, both the ageing society and the general needs of improving the quality of life and
well-being have lead policy makers in many countries to turn to individuals at home and
the social networks of the individuals, and to deliver the service over the networks, as
an important source of long-term health care, where social things and social computing
would play important roles.
Fig. 6. Social connectedness through unconscious and peripheral data [25, 26]
3.3
Social Things in Public Spaces
Social things are often situated in public spaces, enabling social interaction among
multiple users and systems, and the analysis of the social behavior based on the collected
data [30–33]. Several research carriers in our projects are interactive and participatory
public installations, either functional or artistic [11, 34–36]. These interactive installa‐
tions require gathering input, data and information using computer vision, mobile
devices, connected or embedded sensors from either the physical space or social
networks. For output, many of these installations using projection mapping to augment
the physical objects or spaces with a digital layer, being a good example for designing
systems that integrate the physical with the digital. These installations often aim at an
environment or connected spaces, being a very good research carrier for the Internet of
Things as situated and large scale objects, and for studying the group user behavior and
experience [37]. Figure 7 shows the installation designed for the city of Taicang, China.

The installation is roughly 10 by 10 meters on its base and 8 meters high. On top of the
base are constructions that give the impressions of a large sail, and the moon rising from
the waves. Images, animations and videos can be projected onto the inner surface of sail
in the evenings, allowing the public to contribute their photos from social media to
induce the feeling of social connectedness [11, 35].
Fig. 7. Moon rising from sea [11, 35]
3.4
Social Things for Sustainability
Several projects have been carried out in the TU/e DESIS lab, part of the DESIS (Design
for Social Innovation and Sustainability) association, a “network of design labs, basked
in design schools and design oriented universities, actively involved in promoting and
supporting sustainable change”. Next to the research activities in designing for social
interaction in public spaces as already mentioned, activities are mostly educational with
student projects. Recently together with two Ph.D. students we started our research
activities in a social recipe recommendation system for food sustainability, with the help
of the Internet of Things (Fig. 8, mobile devices and intelligent trash bins) [38, 39].

Concluding Remarks
The research area “social things” focuses more on social computing as tools and plat‐
forms for design. The design context of social interaction, social innovation and service
centric design requires close cooperation with other expertise. It is expected to closely
collaborate on social interaction with colleagues from the user centered design and
research, on tangible and physical interaction as well as social innovation with collea‐
gues in interaction design and social design, and on the service centric design process
with the colleagues with a business perspective. The Internet of Things elements of this
research will not only generate data for data driven design, but also blend the analyzed
results into the physical forms in the created designs.
The research focus is more on designing social computing tools and platforms than
it is on developing the enabling technology itself, which requires collaboration with
computer science and electrical engineering.
It is also expected to contribute to key societal issues such as energy, health and
mobility. Possibilities in contributing to other areas shall be considered, for example the
environment and energy domain oﬀers many opportunities for exploring crowdsourcing;
techniques and social intelligence in systems design; social networking can provide ad-
hoc yet real time information from the drivers and vehicles for a more eﬃcient traﬃc,
or for a better experience on move.

Abstract. This paper explores how design can develop an innovatory practice
that builds the skills needed to design with cultural sensitivity. It is relevant to
designers, researchers, and developers interested in extending the capabilities of
innovating in relationship to culture. This paper presents a series of learning
projects and outcomes that demonstrate the development of a cultural design tool.
The project took place between Goldsmiths University of London in the United
Kingdom and (KDM) Korean Design Membership in South Korea.

Introduction
Design engages with many aspects of life, from the design of the sound and experience
of an alarm clock that wakes us up in the morning, to the underlying cultural knowledge
that informs the design of mobile phone interfaces in diﬀerent socio-cultural contexts.
Sherry Turkle (2011) discusses that it is important to understand the complex cultural
connections we have with things. We need to build a critical understanding of the cultural
context to be able to design successfully, particularly for a wider global context, not
only to conserve but also to develop cultural identities. Therefore, although a design can
often have universality, it must be sensitive to cultural nuances. The underlying focus
of the proposed experimental Cross-Cultural Design (CCD) tool is to learn, develop and
apply skills in engaging designers culturally and their understanding of ‘cultural diﬀer‐
ence’. It is not only design that is concerned with understanding culture, but other subject
areas like contemporary critical, social, and cultural theory can also support the activity
of Cross-Cultural Design (Diehl and Christianns 2006). In today’s multicultural soci‐
eties, understanding this cultural diﬀerence is a skill required by designers to engage
meaningfully with users, particularly with the increased use of consumer technologies.
As a result of globalisation, considerable eﬀorts are being made to explore and under‐
stand cross-cultural relationships. This paper takes the speciﬁc example of cross-cultural
design innovation projects held at Goldsmiths, University of London, in the United

Kingdom and at the KDM design center in Seoul, South Korea. The aim of the paper is
to present the proposed learning tool and discuss the development of cultural knowledge
capital by the participants. There were 150 participants in total from the Korea Design
Membership- a Korean Government organisation, the Regional Design Center in
Gwangju, Daegu, Pusan cities, South Korea.
A series of case studies comparing a range of projects, briefs, outcomes, and eval‐
uations will be presented in the paper. These case studies explore the implementation
and ongoing development of Cross-Cultural Design (CCD). The projects explore
learning that requires students to identify and explore diﬀerent cultural backgrounds of
a range of users. Here, the cultural diﬀerence could be between countries, genders and
the like. How to deﬁne this ‘cultural diﬀerence’ is the very ﬁrst task assigned to students
in order to understand the context of the individual design activity and reinterpret it in
its actual context (Curedale 2012). By analysing, comparing, displacing and reposi‐
tioning their original meaning, students can attain a cohesive understanding of their
function, role, cultural values, beliefs, aspirations and ideals; whilst learning about the
rationale behind current designs and ﬁnally reinterpreting them in contemporary
contexts.
From the initial workshops and project briefs a model was developed to help the
students explore cross cultural concerns within their work. This learning tool helped
students understand the nuances of cultures, and understand and interpret diﬀerent
cultures with the aim of developing new directions to explore, creating cultural inno‐
vations, and evolving design concepts. The model was divided into categories of
approach to cultural formations;
1. Combination and Harmonisation - Design process based on sharing ideas and facil‐
itating communication between two or more cultures.
2. Hybrid and Fusion - Design process based on sharing ideas. Similar to combination
and harmonisation, Hybrid and Fusion will lead to a synergy of ideas and innovative
results.
3. Transform/Translate/Transplant - Design process based on the idea of adopting one
culture into another, and analysing the eﬀects.
4. Inclusion and Exclusion - Design process based on deﬁning boundaries examined
from two diﬀerent angles: protecting your own culture, and disregarding another
culture.
We are witnessing the rapid development of many technology based products and
services, and simultaneously global audiences are becoming more sophisticated and
complex, as diﬀerent cultural expectations and social needs need to be considered.
Design is rapidly developing with many innovative products and services that combine
manufactured hardware and software which require cultural knowledge to be well
received by their user communities. Theorist Theodore Levitt (1983), in his Harvard
Business Review article, The Globalization of the Markets, paid particular attention to
the phenomenon of ‘standardised products and brands’. Several observations were made
including; (Levitt, 1983 IN Douglas and Wind 1987, p. 419);
1. Customers in the global markets’ needs and interests are becoming increasingly
homogenous worldwide;
90

2. People around the world are willing to sacriﬁce preferences in product features,
functions, design, and the like for lower prices at high quality; and
3. Substantial economies of scale in production and marketing can be achieved through
supplying global markets.
The proposed model of cultural engagement should help address this shifting
requirement of innovation. There is an interest to support the hyper-local, regional and
national to promote their own cultures, whilst respecting and understanding the cultures
of others. At a national level governments are aware that their own creative industries
can have a major impact on their economies. Consumers and prosumers are becoming
more sophisticated and want to access and be part of the formation of a wider and more
culturally rich range of products and services.
2
The Importance of Cross-Cultural Design
The beneﬁts to the users of cross culture design are that products and services can engage
with exposing users to cultural fashion, other cultural practices that they may want to
learn more about. These practices may be about how we would like to live our lives, be
diﬀerent from others, and adopt other cultural practices that add something to our own
lives. Often when designs of products and services are exported to other cultures their
understanding can be misinterpreted as cultural values can be very diﬀerent. In each
culture there are diﬀerent thoughts on what is fashionable, interesting and what quality
might mean. What one culture may ﬁnd amusing, another might ﬁnd oﬀensive. This is
why understanding other cultures is so important for designers to engage with. There
are also good arguments to suggest that local designers should be involved in innovation
teams, that bring some of their own cultural understanding to a particular project.

Current Status of Design Education and Why Learning About
‘Culture’ Is Important
Common teaching methods within undergraduate higher education design include briefs
within set themes, creating a basis for students to make sense and solve problems prac‐
tically, individually, or in groups. Implementing novel and playful methods into design
processes allows students to step out of their comfort zone and follow often-unexpected
routes to a new way of developing a design outcome. Current trends in design education
across industry encourage use of interdisciplinary design and collaborative practice. A
cross-cultural approach to collaborative projects enables use of group work through a
multicultural way of thinking, and opens doors to exciting new ways of combining
design ethics and processes developed within individual design discipline backgrounds.
As Kolko (2010) declared, broader design and a diversity of methods should be an
integral tool for educating future designers that should be sought out by educators. By
introducing innovative methods of teaching students about design issues and giving a
wider view on the aﬀordance of design, the trained designers of the future will be able

to tackle design problems and briefs with an open view of the designer’s roles and
responsibilities.
At Goldsmiths there are a series of tools used to identify the relationship between
the designer and user, and the contexts of site, event, society and culture were used in
all of the cross-cultural design briefs. What is central to this relationship diagram is the
dialogical relationship being developed between designer and user, identiﬁed as an
empathetic understanding built on an engaged connection with the user. In the centre of
the diagram below is a mediating lens through which the designer sees the context of
user and the object of innovation. This lens encourages the designer to acknowledge that
they have particular cultural biases or inﬂuences that they see the the project through.
They can also invest in exploring particular ways to look or understand the culture of
the user, citizen or participant (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1. Terry rosenberg context of design diagram (drawing mike waller)
We adopted Runco’s playful approach to the design briefs for these cross-cultural
projects. (2013, p. 111) Runco reminds us that the notion of creativity is not new; it is
practised, accepted, and shared across cultures. However, using creativity as a starting
point, or a means to instigate cross-cultural exchange, relationships and collaboration
can encourage more solid learning, understanding, and appreciation of new (i.e. diﬀerent
to one’s own) culture. “Given that there are often large diﬀerences in the prevailing ideas
and practices between diﬀerent cultures, a product/idea judged as being very creative in
one culture might be perceived very diﬀerently in another culture” (Wolbers 2013, p.
86).
Rajeshwari Ghose is a Hong Kong-based critic featured in Buchanan and Margolin’s
‘The Idea of Design (1995b)’. She discusses the pace and attitude towards design and
development in Asia compared with that of the Western world, saying that, “China had
no modern design education until the late 1970s. Design education has been formed
mainly in western countries” (Buchanan and Margolin 1995a, p. 192).
It is apparent that there is a need for a platform that enables creative collaboration
between cultures, so that an appreciation of a wider set of properties can be established
between cultures. As Buchanan and Margolin (1995a,b) highlight, it will result in the
introduction of new possibilities of collaboration because of an in-depth understanding
of what others do.

Setting up CCD Learning Programme
We have been running Cross-Cultural Design programmes and teaching students from
a variety of Korean design universities within the Design Department at Goldsmiths,
University of London for the past ﬁve years. The Cross-Cultural Design programmes
have been developed around diﬀerent themes related to diﬀerent cultural concerns, from
tourism to cultural practices. From this experience, we found that students were able to
engage and understand cultural diﬀerence through the design project brief, and they were
able to develop new types of Cross-Cultural Design enquiries. Through the delivery of
these cross-cultural design projects it is clear that cross-cultural design activities within
the design curriculum help students understand and respect cultural diﬀerence, and
support the success for the future development of a culturally enriched design ﬁeld.
The programmes used the developed CCD learning tool, which were evolved and
iterated at the Pi Studio (Prospecting and Innovation Design Research Studio) at Gold‐
smiths, University of London for the students from Kyung Hee University, Korea. As
with all of the project design briefs, the teaching teams have tried to focus on a clear
and meaningful topic, identiﬁed as requiring exploration through designing (Table 1).

Bon voyage
This project is about a journey or a variety of journeys, which were
geographic and creative. During this particular project, the
impact, implications, and counter-arguments of globalisation
were researched, with the aim of developing these issues whilst
still enjoying the celebration of cultural diﬀerences through the
design concepts

Tourism of the ordinary As designers we are interested in understanding, exploring and
reinventing the world. This project engages with a number of
lost cultural practices in Korea, drawing on them to invent new
cultural practices as well as reinventing existing ones

Future shopping
This brief introduces students to a live project exploring the posi‐
tive disruption that design can make in proposing new and future
forms of retail cultures. Designers think about ‘positive disrup‐
tions’, as well as how to work with ideas that address change
and transformation caused by emerging technology
5
Development of Cross-Cultural Design Learning Tool
The cross-cultural design tool is introduced within each of the projects to assist the
students in deconstructing their understanding of culture. The four approaches to cultural
enquiry include; (1) Combination and Harmonisation, (2) Hybrid and Fusion, (3) Trans‐
form/Translate/Transplant, (4) Inclusion and Exclusion.
Cross-Cultural Design Learning Tool
93

Combination and harmonisation involves sharing and communicating ideas between
cultures with a view to be able to create cultural forms that span one or more cultural
practices from diﬀerent cultures and encourage communication and interest from the
other cultures, including practices, behaviours, materials and artefacts. Hybrid and
fusion is intended as a way to inspire more radical collisions of culture. The lace bowls,
designed by Ching-Ting Hsu, and craft art by Tsun-Jen Lee are examples of what
happens when an oriental embroidery pattern is combined with western aesthetic lace.
Through transform/translate/transplant, students endeavour to carry a cultural practice
from one context into another, and explore the possible impact. Inclusion and exclusion
focuses on building cultural bridges to invite the other into, or creating cultural fences
that guard one’s own culture and traditions, therefore exclude other cultures. In some
cases it is possible to create a new culture that includes some members but excludes
others, like a subculture.

Testing the Cross-Cultural Design Learning Tool
The CCD learning tool has been tested ﬁrstly to verify the viability of the Cross-Cultural
Design concepts, and secondly to test the Cross-Cultural Design programme, analyse
the design outcomes, and develop Cross-Cultural Design tools. There were 38 CCD
design outcomes by 150 participants in total from KDM (Korea Design Membership-a
Korean Government organisation), with support of MA Design students from Gold‐
smiths, University of London. The outcomes of the CCD learning tool in the four cate‐
gories can be seen in the case studies below.
6.1
Exploring the Category 1. Combination and Harmonisation
Global-wall public display for a street market in London and Seoul.
This project explored how a new form of public market media display could allow
market traders to communicate with people in diﬀerent markets globally. The aim was
to open up new forms of trade or harmony between market stall holders in Seoul and in

London. Building a speciﬁc located communication technology or platform could create
the conditions to stimulate inter-cultural trade (Fig. 2).
6.2
Exploring the Category 2. Hybrid and Fusion
This Tea Explorer example is an electronic plugin tool that creates the smells of a
particular type of tea. It also includes a media application that explains the culture of
brewing, and delivers a service to access the supply of diﬀerent teas from diﬀerent
countries. This is about combining cultures to make a cross-cultural tool to sample
multiple cultures of tea (Fig. 3).

6.3
Exploring the Category 3. Transform/Translate/Transplant
Picnic bag for a city, London version.
The concept of the Picnicking bag of London is that the traditional Korean ‘BOJAKI-
wrapping cloth’ can be merged with the British picnic culture by creating a picnic mat
which also transforms into a map of the city (Fig. 4).

6.4
Exploring the Category 3. Inclusion and Exclusion
Digital Mirror of Shame
Diﬀerent meanings shame in Europe and South Korean - Shame of Korean: beauty,
Shame of European: obesity (Fig. 5)
Fig. 5. The door of shame concept (Source: student project outcome)
This example from a student response to a brief that juxtaposing two diﬀerent cultural
sensibilities towards the concept of shame in the UK and in Korea. Interestingly while
this would never become a product as it could oﬀend its users, it exposes the nuances
of Korean and British cultural attitudes to shame. This more in depth exploration of
culture permits the students to explore the possible collisions of these attitudes within
their design projects. There are clearly limitations to this approach, as it can often rely
on preconceived notions and cultural stereotypes, which requires tutor encouragement
to understanding culture through better contextual research.

Conclusion
This paper aimed to present how design tools can support the development of creative
synergies and the understanding and respect of cultural diversities. Cross-cultural
design, whilst respecting cultural diversity, can also protect and enhance particular
cultures, national, regional and local. Designing is a cultural activity, and this tool locates
the study of culture within the design curriculum. The territory of design is also rapidly
shifting from physically manufactured goods to hybrid products that often combine
manufactured goods, service and software. The audiences for these new designs are
culturally interesting as they often span geographies, and create new forms of cultures
through their user communities. Cross-cultural design tools are not just limited to use
in undergraduate design learning, but are also relevant to innovation within multicultural
communities, governments, organisations and businesses.

Abstract. Virtual hand pose and gestures for manipulation is one of the hardest
interactive problem in Spaceﬂight Training System. This paper researched the
usability of hand pose and gestures, proposed a couple of non-contact action
determining rules and an action states transition method based on ﬁnite state
machine (FSM) to control the manipulation process of virtual hand. Meanwhile,
a gesture recognition method based on hand pose data was proposed. The
experiment result shows that the proposed method has a high success rate and
efﬁciency for manipulation. It can be used for the way of manipulation in

With the rapid development of computer technology in the ﬁeld of spaceﬂight training,
Augmented and Virtual Reality Environments arise and become part of training system.
The role of human computer interaction with these system, or HCI, is becoming more
important. In particular, an approach that involves adapting the way humans com-
municate with each other for HCI is considered to be the most promising. Potential
spaceﬂight training systems which use these new technologies require input devices
that can be easily carried along with the user and instantly available when needed (or
made available by the environment). Such technologies pose several challenges on the
GUI (Graphical User Interface) paradigm designed for desktop interaction, particularly
on current input devices such as keyboards and mouse [1–4].
Especially, spaceﬂight training systems inherently requires controls with a high
degree of freedom. For instance, manipulation of a 3D object with using user’s hand
directly rather than with a mouse can offer an ideal alternative and more comfortable
and easier way than using mouse and keyboard for such systems [3–5]. In this way,
users can control the position and orientation of a 3D object directly by simply moving
their hands.

Although wearable devices might be an option, a computer vision based gesture
recognition system seems to be a more natural alternative since it can be considered as
part of the environment and operates remotely, it does not require the user to wear or
have any physical contact with a device. A gesture based interface has the potential of
eliminating the need of pointing devices, thus saving the time and effort in using such
devices for the interaction process. As a result, the interaction with AR/VR system
based on gestures motivated us to develop a method for tracking a user’s hand in 3D
and recognizing hand gestures in real-time without using any invasive devices attached
to the hand [5]. In this work, referring to the previous method [2] we proposed a new
technique for estimating the 3D gesture based on the 3D pose of a user’s hand by using
depth camera in real-time. In addition, the proposed technique is able to recognize
predetermined hand gestures in a fast and robust manner by using Machine Learning
which has been properly trained beforehand. Meanwhile, because performing gestures
for long periods of time can be physically stressing, the understanding of how gestures
can be more effectively and more comfortably used to communicate with training
systems becomes more important.

Hand Pose and Gestures Lexicon
In terms of hand pose, the user uses a virtual hand based on the data of hand pose to
manipulate the virtual object as human do in the reality world. Hand gestures are
different. The virtual system captures hand movements and then hand movements will
be recognized as corresponding gestures that can generate command to control virtual
objects or 3D menu.
In the previous study, we found that the system needs to carry out the physical
collision detection between virtual hand and virtual objects when using hand pose to
manipulate the virtual object. It is well known that physical collision detection is a very
complicated process. In this paper, we will merge these two modes to make an
interface with the virtual reality system.
In term of object manipulation, there are several kinds of actions that need to be
carried out by the astronaut in the training system:
• Push the button on the menu: The astronaut usually need information which is
triggered by buttons on the 3D menu to control the training process.
• Select: Select the object.
• Grab: Grab the object.
• Rotate: Rotate the object.
• Move: Move the object.
• Release: Release the manipulated object.
So the commands generated by hand pose and gestures includes Push, Select, Grab,
Rotate, Move and Release. According to our study, we deﬁned the hand pose and
gestures as following Table 1.

Action States Transition Based on FSM
When the astronaut is training, those actions are continuous. So those actions need to
be distinguished based on the state of the different movement. According to the special
virtual weightless environment of astronaut virtual training, this paper proposed a
couple of non-contact action determining rules and an action state transition method
based on ﬁnite state machine (FSM). Finite state machine (FSM) [6, 7] is a good tool
for states control of the virtual hand action. The interactive model of FSM for virtual
hand action is shown in Fig. 1, where S represents the state, c represents the states
transition conditions.
As our previous research results [8], we proposed some action determining rules
which are a kind of rules that used to determine whether a virtual hand manipulates the
object in virtual training world.
Because all of the objects in the training system are weightless, a slight touch from
virtual hand would lead to the movement of objects, which will result in failure to
manipulate. Traditional determining rules based on collision detection are not suitable
for weightless virtual environment. We developed two non-contact determining rules
based on hand pose and gestures.

Rule One: the distance between the object and the virtual hand must be less than a
certain critical value.
Rule Two: the character value of the hand gesture is must be less than a certain
critical value, which is called the object action trigger area.
It is determined that action is successful only if the virtual hand and the object meet
the condition of Rule One and Rule Two at the same time. After successful action, the
object is attached to the virtual hand and moves with it together. The object will be
released when the virtual hand does not satisfy Rule Two.
According to the principle of FSM, the constituent elements of FSM are deﬁned
as: states (S), input events (X), output (Y), states transition function (f ) and output
function (g).
States (S): action states of virtual hand. There are ﬁve states, Free State, Trigger
State, Gesture State, Move State and Release State. Each state corresponds to a kind of
action state between the virtual hand and the object.
Input events (X): correspond to the ﬁve states shown in Fig. 1. There are six
conditions which are the virtual hand moving into the object action trigger area, the
virtual hand moving out of the object action trigger area, the virtual hand meeting the
rules of gesture, the virtual hand meeting the rules of move, the virtual hand meeting
the condition of release and the object being released.
Output (Y): the rendering results displayed to the operator.
States transition function (f): deﬁned as the determination function which
determines the states transition from the current state to the next one. Equation (1)
shows its relationship with the states and time, where XðtÞ 2 X,SðtÞ 2 S.
Sðt þ 1Þ ¼ f ðXðtÞ; SðtÞÞ

Output function (g): deﬁned as a mapping relationship between the current state
and the output. Equation (2) shows its relationship with the states, where YðtÞ 2 Y.
YðtÞ ¼ gðXðtÞ; SðtÞÞ
ð2Þ
Free State (S0): the virtual hand does not touch any object. In this condition,
virtual hand can move freely and the ﬁnger joints can bend freely.
Trigger State (S1): the virtual hand moves into the object action trigger area, but
does not meet the action determining rules. At this time, the virtual hand does not touch
the object, the object does not be manipulated.
Gesture State (S2): the virtual hand can manipulate the object stably by following
the gesture determining rules. The object is adsorbed to virtual hand in the gesture state.
Move State (S3): the virtual hand can manipulate the object stably by following the
two determining rules. The object is adsorbed to virtual hand moving with the virtual
hand together as a child node.
Release State (S4): the virtual hand converts to the release state when it does not
satisfy Rule Two of the action determining rules after manipulating the object. In this
state, the virtual hand releases the object and then converts to the free state.

The Gesture Recognition Method
There are many devices provide the data of hand pose such as Intel RealSense, Leap
Motion, Kinect etc. Due to the high accuracy of Leap Motion [9], we choose the pose
data provided by the Leap Motion for gesture recognition.
4.1
Gesture Recognition Algorithm
As already reported the Leap Motion device provides only a limited set of relevant
points and not a complete description of the hand shape [10]. But the device provides
directly some of the most relevant points for gesture recognition and allows to avoid
complex computations needed for their extraction from depth and color data. The Leap
Motion sensor mainly provides the following data, as depicted in Fig. 2:
• Number of detected ﬁngers N 2 [0, 5].
• Position of the ﬁngertips Fi, i = 1… N.
• Palm center C.
• Hand orientation, h points from the palm center to the direction of the ﬁngers, n is
the normal to the plane that corresponds to the palm region pointing downward
from the palm center.
• Hand radius r.
Note that the accuracy is not the same for all the reported data vectors. The 3D
positions of the ﬁngertips are quite accurate: according to a recent research [9] the error
is about 200 um. While the localization of the detected ﬁngers is accurate, their
detection is not too reliable. There are some situations in which the sensor is not able to
recognize all the ﬁngers such as ﬁngers folded over the hand, hidden from the sensor
viewpoint, ﬁngers touching each other and the hand not perpendicular to the camera,
etc. These issues are quite critical and must be taken into account in developing a

reliable gesture recognition approach since in different executions of the same gesture
the number of captured ﬁngers could vary. For this reason simple schemes based on the
number of detected ﬁngers have poor performance. As previously proposed approach
[10] we deal with this issue by sorting the features on the basis of the ﬁngertip angle
with respect to the hand direction h. In this paper, we also consider the ratio of
circumference and area.
In order to account for the ﬁngers misalignment, we consider the projection of the
hand region into the palm plane described by n and passing through C, as depicted in
Fig. 3. In this work we analyze 5 different types of features computed from the Leap
Motion data that will be described in the rest of this section:
• Fingertip angles: angles corresponding to the orientation of each ﬁngertip projected
onto the palm plane with respect to the hand orientation h.
• Fingertip distances: 3D distance of the ﬁngertips from the hand center.
• Fingertip elevations: distances of the ﬁngertip from the palm region plane.
• Fingertip 3D positions: x, y and z coordinates of the ﬁngertips.
• Circumference and area ratio: Circumference is the sum of the connections between
the ﬁve ﬁngers and the palm of the hand. Area is the middle part of the ﬁve ﬁngers
and the center of the palm.
All the features values (except for the angles) are normalized in the interval [0, 1]
by dividing the values for the distance between the hand center and the middle ﬁngertip
length S = ||Fmiddle −C|| in order to make the approach robust to people with hands of
different size. The scale factor S can be computed during the calibration of the system.
After the completion of the feature extraction, we need a classiﬁer to classify the
features. Due to the small number of samples, the SVM (Support Vector Machines)
classiﬁer [11] was selected for feature classiﬁcation. In SVM, the sample space is
mapped to a high dimensional space through a nonlinear mapping method, which
makes the original nonlinear problem transform into the linearly separable problem in
the feature space. Then the optimal hyper plane is found in the high dimension space.
Fig. 3. The features of hand

103

In this way, the features are classiﬁed. Because the radial basis kernel function can
realize the nonlinear mapping and need fewer parameters, the radial basis kernel
function model is selected in this paper.
4.2
Noise Suppression
Although the tracking accuracy of Leap Motion is less than submillimeter in theory,
Leap Motion still can produce identiﬁcation unstable phenomenon. Device resolution,
thermal magnetic noise, hand shake [12], visual and numerical block singular value
solvers are likely to introduce noise signal. In this paper, the literature [13] proposed an
adaptive cut-off frequency of the low pass ﬁltering method, the cutoff frequency of the
low pass ﬁlter will be changed by detecting the real-time speed of palm. Equation (3)
gives adaptive ﬁlter parameters and calculation expression.
^Xi ¼ aiXi þ ð1  aiÞ^Xi1
ð3Þ
Xi is a high-dimensional vector which is composed of the coordinates and vector values
returned from Leap Motion.
^Xi is a vector after adaptive ﬁltering, ai, as Eq. (4), can be calculated by the sensor data

Experiment and Result
For veriﬁcation of the method, an action rules sub-experiment and an equipment
assembly training sub-experiment were designed. Then subjective evaluation and
objective evaluation were carried out [14].
This experiment has a total of 40 subjects, including 30 researchers who develop
the space ﬂight simulator and 10 graduate students who major in graphics and virtual
reality. They understand the basic principles and application of virtual reality, computer
graphics and the interaction with virtual reality system. But they didn’t have the
experience of the orbit assembly training.

5.1
Action Rules Experiment
In order to test our action rules and simulation FSM model, we designed a grab
experiment. We analyzed 358 times grabbing operation from 40 subjects. We took the
average number of grabbing operation every successful grab and the average grabbing
time as the evaluation. The result is shown in Table 2.
From the evaluation above we can conclude that the virtual hand grabbing oper-
ation, which following our action determining rules and FSM model, has a high success
rate and efﬁciency. This method can be used as astronaut operation training method in a
virtual weightless environment.
5.2
Equipment Assembly Training Experiment
The experiment system is shown in Fig. 4. The subjects complete the gas generator for
exercise assembly training according to the predeﬁned process.
To verify the effectiveness of the astronaut virtual assembly training, the assembly
training method which guided by the learning manual were compared. The manual of
assembly learning is a standard handbook. The speciﬁc assembly steps are introduced
in detail by words and pictures. The manual of learning as the traditional way of
training and virtual assembly training were compared to verify the efﬁciency and effect
of the method of training.

Subjects were divided into control group and experimental group. Each group has
20 subjects. Control group does experiment by learning assembly manual training, and
then have a real assemble. Learning training manual required time and the real
assembly time were recorded. After the completion of the real assembly, the control
group of experimenters transfer to virtual assembly training experience, experience
after the completion of the ﬁll in for virtual training methods of subjective evaluation
questionnaire. While in the experimental group, in reverse order, assembly training
through the virtual assembly training system, then the assembly objects, recorded both
in manual training experience and ﬁll in the questionnaire.
Through the calculation and analysis of the recorded data, we can ﬁnd that, the
average time required for the control group to training is 287.83 s, the experimental
group is 183.81 s, the average time required for the control group and experimental group
to manipulate are 87.13 s and 77.52 s, which indicates that the training efﬁciency and
training effect of the experimental group are signiﬁcantly better than that of the control
group. Other results of subjective evaluation questionnaires are as shown in Table 3.
It can be seen from subjective evaluation results and questionnaire that the pro-
posed method is effective and can be used into the virtual training system.

Summary
Our experiments show that the advantage is obvious with using hand pose and gestures
for HCI. As a new way to interact with VR system, it provides a more natural way to
manipulate the virtual objects in the VR environment, reduces the user’s learning time,
improves operational efﬁciency and can very harmoniously embedded in training
system. But there are also some disadvantages, such as the time to ﬁnish a menu
operation is slower than using a mouse and as is the case usually occurs as likely to
cause fatigue. Further research will be conducted to reduce the discomfort fatigue.

Abstract. This article presents a two-step study, which is part of a project that
aims at investigating how cross-cultural systems, intentionally or not, express and
promote indirect intercultural encounters in Human-Computer Interaction.
Previous research have proposed ﬁve Cultural Viewpoint Metaphors, a Semiotic
Engineering conceptual tool to support HCI designers to understand and organize
communicative strategies in the interactive discourse to promote such encounters.
At this stage of our research we investigated the design of cross-cultural systems
using CVM and one of the best known among numerous classes of signs proposed
by Peirce – icons, indices and symbols, aiming at supporting the semiotic engi‐
neering (speciﬁcally, the choice of signs, i.e. the interface elements) of these kind
of applications. Our ﬁndings point at the power of an alignment of the semiotic
characteristics of Cultural Viewpoint Metaphors with theoretical semiotic
elements from Peirce’s typology of signs in the interaction design cycle of cross-
cultural systems.

Introduction
The ever-increasing World Wide Web (Web) and its wide variety of cross-cultural
applications (i.e. systems that intentionally expose foreign material to their users [16])
and users from diﬀerent cultures have established a growing interest and need in research
about Culture and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Over the years HCI research
has been conducted aiming at investigating methodological [1, 6, 14, 17] and practical
challenges [2, 10, 12, 21] about international and cultural aspects of HCI, such as the
eﬀect of culture in interaction [4, 11], intercultural collaboration [21], solutions to HCI
design and culture-sensitive interaction [15].

This work is part of a broader research about how cross-cultural systems may, inten‐
tionally or not, express and promote indirect intercultural encounters with signs and
traces of foreign values, practices, heritage, and so on, in HCI. Intercultural encounters
in HCI may direct or indirect [15]. Direct intercultural encounters may happen when
users make contact by interacting with users from others cultures with CMC technology.
Indirect intercultural encounters, in turn, take place when users are exposed and/or may
explore cultural diversity (belief, law, customs, language, symbols and so on) by inter‐
acting with cross-cultural systems.
The two-step study presented in this paper investigated such indirect intercultural
encounters with concepts of Cultural Viewpoint Metaphors (CVM) and Peirce’s
typology of signs (icons, indexes and symbols). CVM is a Semiotic Engineering [4, 5]
conceptual tool to support designers in stimulating users to engage in diﬀerent levels of
intercultural contact (if it is desirable), which may increase their perception about
cultural diversity in the particular domain where the system is placed. So, the intercul‐
tural contact potentially causes a level of perception of cultural diversity. The adoption
of each metaphor invite designers to follow a speciﬁc combination of communication
features and cultural variables to achieve eﬀects on interactive discourse.
Previous studies with CVM focused on the communication of culture investigating
HCI practitioners’ [15], users’ [8] perspectives and methodological issues [9]. Among
others, the results show two main contributions: (i) CVM have strong epistemic power
for guiding the choices of communicative strategies in the design of cross-cultural
application; (ii) CVM may be used as a vocabulary to reach users’ cultural perspectives
at evaluation time. In this paper, we are focusing on the semiotic engineering of cross-
cultural applications regarding to how designers may protocol cultural components in
the interface to promote intercultural encounters in HCI.
In order to address the research question presented above, we conduct a two-step
study to understand the diﬀerent ways of promoting intercultural contact with cultural
diversity by using CVM (and their respective eﬀects) in the light of Peirce’s typology
of signs. We aim at discussing and contrasting diﬀerent ways to promote intercultural
encounters in HCI as well as investigating users’ perceptions about them.
The paper is structured in four sections. After the introduction, we present our theo‐
retical foundations, with a brief explanation of CVM and Peirce’s typology of signs.
Next, the two-step study to answer our research question. Finally, our conclusion and
possibilities for future work.

Theoretical Foundations
This paper presents a theoretical characterization of possible indirect intercultural
encounters that may take place in HCI.
2.1
Cultural Viewpoint Metaphors
CVM is a Semiotic Engineering conceptual tool to support the decisions on dimensions
of intercultural encounters in HCI design cycle of cross-cultural systems. Semiotic
Characterizing Intercultural Encounters

Engineering, a semiotic theory of HCI, which is rooted in Peirce’s [18, 19] and Eco’s
view [8] of Semiotics, a comprehensive study of culturally-determined codes and signs
production, at all levels of human experience. According to Eco culture is the basis of
two fundamental process: signiﬁcation and communication.
Following these foundations, Semiotic Engineering theory supports the study of a
distinctive unit of investigation: HCI as a particular kind of computer-mediated commu‐
nication. Besides the cultural aspects of users and systems (itself), the theory involves
the designer in the communication and signiﬁcation process in HCI. In Semiotic Engi‐
neering terms, interaction designers need to choose and use (codify in the interface)
signs to say how, why and what for the users may use the interactive system to reach
their purposes. The combination of signs (interface elements, communicative strategies
and styles and so on) will compose the interactive language.
Designers need, therefore, to be mindful of how (un)powerfully the interactive
language may be due the choices they made (at design time) to communicate speciﬁc
messages to be diﬀerently understood and perceived by individuals from multiple
cultures. The ﬁve conceptual metaphors lead HCI practitioners to think about interaction
as a journey in which the users are the travelers. CVM are plotted in a continuum of
cultural approximation that goes from the user culture to a visited foreign culture (see
Fig. 1). Each metaphor represents a diﬀerent intensity of intercultural contact (between
users and cultural signs from foreign cultures).
Fig. 1. Cultural Viewpoint Metaphors [15]
The domestic traveler metaphor keeps the user isolated in their own culture, the
foreign culture is invisible to the user and communication is performed in users’ own
native language, with no references to foreign practices and cultural values [16]. On the
opposite site, with the foreign without translator metaphor the user may have contact
with foreign culture as it is, with no mediation. There is an absence of cultural mediation
in these two extremes.
In the three intermediary metaphors, diﬀerent levels of cultural mediation inﬂuence
the intercultural encounters. With the observer at a distance metaphor, cultural markers
of another culture are communicated as “bits of information”: small facts about the
foreign culture are presented for users interested in learning more about the subject (the
native users’ culture and language dominate).

The guided tour visitor metaphor provides a contrast between the two cultures (the
user and the foreign culture), so the foreign culture is illustrated and explained in the
user’s language through cultural markers that illustrate the foreign culture: there is a
strong cultural mediation and approximation.
The foreigner with translator metaphor allows the foreign culture to be experienced
directly, but with language translation of the verbal content, i.e., the cultural markers
can be experienced directly, but in the user’s language. Thus, the three metaphors situ‐
ated between the two extremes (observer at a distance, guided tour visitor and foreigner
with translator) indicate how does the intercultural encounters may take place according
to the diﬀerent levels of cultural mediation.
The adoption of each metaphor entails a diﬀerent organization of the interactive
discourse, including the design of communication features and the combinations of
values assigned to two cultural variables: language (native or foreign) and cultural prac‐
tices (with several domain-dependent values).
2.2
Peirce’s Typology of Signs
Signs have been deﬁned by Peirce [18] as “Something which stands to somebody for
something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the
mind of that person an equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign. That sign
which it creates I call the interpretant of the ﬁrst sign. The sign stands for something, its
object. It stands for that object, not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea, which
I have sometimes called the ground of the representamen”.
Peirce deﬁnes a triadic model for a sign where: the representamen is the form which
the sign takes (not necessarily material); the interpretant is not an interpreter but rather
the sense that a human mind makes of the sign; and the object, to which the sign refers
and thus provides grounding for it. In the following deﬁnition, Peirce clariﬁes the deter‐
mination relationship among the elements of the semiotic triangle: “Sign is anything
which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an eﬀect
upon a person, which eﬀect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately
determined by the former” [18].
For instance, 
 is a sign that represents ‘warning’ by virtue of a conventional
contemporary Western culture interpretation (interpretant). It signiﬁes some risk to a
person. A sign exists whenever some interpreter takes a representation to mean some‐
thing. Moreover, according to Peirce, the meaning of a representation (its interpretant),
is also another sign. Then, each sign has another sign that corresponds to its meaning.
The interaction between the representamen, the object and the interpretant is referred to
by Peirce as ‘semiosis’. Eco uses the term ‘unlimited semiosis’ to characterize this
process as potentially inﬁnite [8].
Peirce deﬁned a fundamental typology of signs that can be manipulated to help
communicators achieve their intent – symbols, indexes and icons. It is intrinsically
related to Peirce’s phenomenological categories of semiotic interest (ﬁrstness, second‐
ness and thirdness), which are meant to provide the basis for explaining any phenomena
of interest, i.e., of all possible experiences to acquire knowledge [20].
Characterizing Intercultural Encounters

The following interpretation of Peirce’s view by Santaella gives us the notion of
what these phenomenological categories are: “Firstness is allied to the ideas of chance,
indeterminacy, freshness, originality, spontaneity, quality, immediacy, monad…
Secondness is associated to the ideas of brute-force, action-reaction, conﬂict, here and
now, eﬀort and endurance, dyad… Thirdness is linked to the ideas of generality,
continuity, growth, advocacy, mediation, triad” [20].

Two-Step Study
Firstly (in Step One), we contrast the concepts and eﬀects proposed by each metaphor
with each Peirce’s phenomenological categories and typology of signs. We aimed at
understanding the relationship between them and the eﬀects in the promotion of inter‐
cultural encounters. We, thus, arrived at three levels of eﬀects in intercultural contact:
cultural diversity unawareness, cultural awareness, and cultural diversity experience.
Secondly (in Step Two), we studied what users perceived at interaction time at an inter‐
cultural encounter situation. We, thus, triangulated the results from Step Two with the
three levels of intercultural contact (achieved in Step One).
3.1
Understanding the Eﬀects of Intercultural Encounters (Step One)
To begin, the domestic traveler metaphor stays out of question, since it does not intend
to promote intercultural contact. The intended design eﬀect is, thus, that of cultural
unawareness, i.e., the condition of being uninformed or unaware about other culture
(unconsciousness resulting from lack of knowledge or attention).
The deﬁnition of observer at a distance metaphor says that “the cultural markers of
another culture are communicated as ‘information’ (not as an experience the use can
‘feel’)”. It is achieved by a narrative about the foreign culture to provide factual infor‐
mation about what is diﬀerent from one’s own culture. So, design intent is to give the
seed for cultural semiosis, but not the experience of cultural diversity itself. In Peirce’s
semiotic terms, the idea of this metaphor is to present an index for the presence of other
culture, so the user will be contact with other culture in a secondness way. We are not
saying that the whole interface is created with indexical signs, but that the general idea
is that a design with this metaphor usually evokes the secondness of the referents of
cultural diversity.
The Guided tour metaphor, in turn, usually evokes the thirdness, since designer’s
deputy mediates intercultural contact by giving meaning to foreign referents. The deﬁ‐
nition says that the cultural markers from another culture are ‘illustrated’ to the user
(aspects of cultural issues are exempliﬁed and explained in the user’s language). It is
achieved by an interpreted view and commentary on the foreign culture which mediates
the user’s approximation and contact with cultural diversity. The idea of this metaphor
is to guide the user’s interpretation by thirdness signs, thus reaching the maximum
mediation.
In both cases (in the observer at a distance and guided tour visitor metaphors) the
intended eﬀect is that of cultural awareness. But the eﬀects on cultural diversity
112
L.C. de C. Salgado et al.

perception are potentially diﬀerent, since the strict associations evoked by secondness
representation in observer at a distance metaphor are not mediated by the designer’s
deputy.
The idea of the foreign with and without translator metaphors is to represent cultural
diversity by evoking the ﬁrstness of their referents, since according to their deﬁnitions
the cultural markers of another culture can be directly ‘experienced’ by the user. With
ﬁrstness signs there is no mediation, but we also see secondness elements with the
foreign with translator metaphor, since the interface in the users’ language acts as a
reference to their native culture when making relations to the foreign cultures. In both
cases, the design intent provokes a cultural experience, since it represents the nearest
point of contact with a foreign culture where the designer may try to oﬀer to the user.
As a whole, in Peirces’ semiotic terms, design represents cultural diversity by signs
to users. If we consider that the correspondence between CVM and the Peirce’s cate‐
gories is plausible, with CVM designers may work thinking about diﬀerent levels of
knowledge in terms of ﬁrstness, secondness, and thirdness. So, designers may consider
that users’ semioses may walk through the continuum of cultural approximation by
reﬂecting how intercultural encounters may stem from rationality to sensorial experi‐
ences with diﬀerent levels of cultural diversity perceptions (see Table 1).

3.2
Exploring User’s Perception (Step Two)
We ran two empirical studies, the Study One (S1) with Englishtown1 (ET website), an
online English school, and the Study Two (S2) with Wikipedia2, a collaborative on-line
free encyclopedia. Our research question was: How users perceive the promotion of
cultural diversity (with intercultural encounters) in HCI?
ET website has not been designed with CVM, but it is clearly a cross-cultural appli‐
cation that exposes and exploits opportunities to intercultural encounters. The ET
mission, as clearly stated in the website “is to use technology to create a fundamentally
better way of learning English”. Wikipedia website is also a cross-cultural application:
a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project with more than 31,000,000
articles in 285 languages.
Each study (S1 and S2) was divided in two steps. In Step One, a Brazilian HCI
evaluator inspected the selected website using CVM to identify portions where diﬀerent
levels of cultural approximation were explored and interactive resources used to promote
indirect intercultural encounters. Seven scenarios of inspection were then created for
user sessions in the next step of the study.
In Step Two, ﬁve potential users were recruited to evaluate (in individual sessions)
the selected portions of the website (in each study). The participants belong to diﬀerent
areas of expertise: Statistics, Informatics, Education or Law. All of them were Brazilian,
with college or university graduation. They all had at least a basic knowledge of English
and are interested in learning more about this language (in S1) and had an interest in
Encyclopedia information (in S2).
Step Two had, therefore, 3 (three) phases: recruitment, empirical study and empirical
data analysis. In the empirical study (of each study), ﬁve diﬀerent participants (P1, P2,
P3, P4 and P5) were brieﬂy introduced to the speciﬁc website and to the concept of
intercultural contact (with examples and illustrations). Then, participants listened to an
explanation of the evaluation activity they should perform. There were seven scenarios
for inspection, each involving one or more tasks. At the end, participants described and
classify detected intercultural encounters enabled by the interaction, with their own
words. After completing the evaluation activity, during the post-test interview, partici‐
pants reported verbally on what they had just done and experienced. This stage aimed
at collecting evidence of their perceptions about how the interaction scenarios promoted
intercultural encounters (or not).
Empirical data analysis was carried out in two stages using discourse analysis tech‐
niques [13], a systematic exploration aiming to ﬁnd out major meaning categories in
discourse with intra-participant and inter-participant analysis. Firstly, we looked for
evidence of each participant’s usage and signiﬁcation of intercultural encounters during
the evaluation activity and post-test interviews. In this stage, we investigated how
participants perceived intercultural encounters according to Peirce typology of signs and
what perceptions they expressed with regard to such encounters.

We conduct a research to see, thus, which category of sign (ﬁrstness, secondeness,
thirdness) the representations (interfaces signs to promote intercultural encounter) have
evoked to users. For that to happen we drawn on the process of signiﬁcation in an inter‐
action context scenario.
Synthesis of Results From Study One (with Englishtown). Results from the empirical
data in Study One pointed at a main category of meanings: speciﬁc interactive resources
promoted particular contacts with foreign culture. For lack of space, we selected only
some pieces of evidence to illustrate the kind of qualitative data we used.
Evidence from participants show how they could be closer from the other culture.
P1, for instance, observed that they can see how natives from other culture (American)
really speak from videos. P4, also commented about the opportunity to have contact
with native’s accent.
P4: “The video is better because you see the situation, I mean, it gives tips about how you can
behave. One’s gets nervous like me (laughs), shy and became confused there. It shows the one’s
tension, which is something that one can not reveal in an interview. […] In this video, it is
simulating an interview situation. [… ] Then you get the accent.”
By using pictures, in a learning situation, the ET website shows interesting places
to take an English course abroad. Excerpts from P1, P2 e P3, for instance, showed us
that this type of interface element attracted attention and sparked the curiosity of them.
P1: “It [the website] wants to sharpen your curiosity in cultural life of the city and not in the
English itself. It calls your attention to their culture to create curiosity.”
P2: “So, this is a dynamic way. He puts a text, a very short content about what is better and the
advantages of studying in that city. So, it is a very dynamic to give you that information and to
motivate you. And it repeats [the cities]. So, if you move quickly, you can come back and see
again. I found it interesting…”
Participants also highlighted the potential of some interface elements. P2, for
instance, said that the quiz give the opportunity to going deeper into other culture. P3
identiﬁed in lessons (using video) many possibilities to be in touch with foreign issues
(subtitled texts, accent, and ﬁgures). P5, in turn, said that the articles are good for students
that do not speak English well.
P2: “[About the quiz ‘Your English is good enough to get around in London’] It put very speciﬁc
things there, slangs. So you can go deeper into their culture.”
Additional evidences, showed that the interface kept participants not so close to
others cultures, but mediated the contact.
P1: “So funny! […] It [the website] is explaining the meaning of each situation. ‘-’ The meaning
of this expression. Is going to be diﬀerent if you translate literally. You have to use the expression
from that place.”
P3: “It explains exactly what is the meaning (which is an expression when you get surprised by
something), he explains what it is (without translating).”
In conclusion, Study One showed that ﬁrstness signs helped users to get closer to
the other culture and thirdness signs mediated the approximation. The quizzes and
Characterizing Intercultural Encounters
115

videos, for instance, promoted an intercultural experience. Participants verbalized that
they could be closer with other culture by having contact with translations, accent and
other speciﬁcities. The articles and tips, in turn, improved their cultural awareness,
because they perceived the opportunities to learn more by having contact with foreign
material with cultural mediation.
Synthesis of Results From Study Two (with Wikipedia). Results from Study Two
also showed us how participants perceived traces of others cultures, semiotically. For
the lack of space, we selected excerpts from participant’s discourse which compose the
following category of meaning: diﬀerent signs evoked diﬀerent reactions and percep‐
tions.
The P1 and P3 perceived the other culture when they saw a table with countries,
which the oﬃcial language is Portuguese. The website also shows a map that reinforces
this contrast.
P1: “The table gives you the opportunity to make a comparison between Brazil, which is my
country, and the other countries that speak the same language. [… ] This contrast is always very
interesting. […] Even here, for example, on the map you can see the contrast regarding the size.
You see the size of Brazil and the size of the other countries [who speak Portuguese as the oﬃcial
language]”.
In other situation, P1, P2, P4 and P5 realized that some links were indexes to learn
more about the other culture.
P1: “You became interested in Poland cooking? Great! You have also other diﬀerent cuisines
in the same continent [Europe]. If you want to check them, you have a link here that allows you
take a look at there. So he’s always encouraging you to take a look, experience the culture of
another country or another region”.
P5: “He [the site] expands the possibilities of knowledge from this small cultural issue (that is
the food). So, if you want to know how is the food in Northern Ireland, Romania, the links enables
you..[to the cuisine of these countries]”.
The sounds also called attention of participants to some details from other culture.
P1 and P2 said that the sound allow them to go deep into other culture. P3, P4 and P5
realized that it is a good strategy to put them closer to foreign cultures.
P3: “I think that when you listen the sound you are you coming closer to this cultural aspect.
One thing is to describe something, but there is no way to describe the sound of the berimbau”.
Some participants S2.P4 and P5 revealed their sensation when in touch with an article
from a very diﬀerent culture.
P4: “He put me in a speciﬁc language, which I do not know which one is. Yeah, I ‘m a little lost,
but I would guess that here [in the top left], for example, was the amount of articles that it has
[in that language]”.
P5: “I suppose, strongly, that it is Poland [this Wikipedia page] and then it makes me feel
illiterate, that is the feeling I have. I look and this is not telling me anything. I imagine they have
relevant information of Polish culture here, historic landmarks, people who were important to
that country or events that were important.”
The Study Two showed us that diﬀerent signs (tables, links, images, sounds, links,
and language) promoted diﬀerent intercultural contacts to users. Moreover, the
116
L.C. de C. Salgado et al.

participants discourse showed how they promoted diﬀerent levels of intercultural
contact.
3.3
Triangulation
The triangulation stage aims at validating our qualitative analysis [3, 7], by looking for
consistencies and inconsistencies among our ﬁndings From Step Two (Empirical
Studies) and Step One (Exploration of CVM and Pierce’s Typology of Signs). After
comparing and contrasting both results, we found evidence that interactive discourse
promoted diﬀerent levels of intercultural encounters due to the type of sign used by
designer.
Discourse excerpts from participants showed us that iconic representations (which
evokes the ﬁrstness of their referents) such as sounds, images and so on promoted an
intercultural experience to participants. When P5 told us that he was lost when inter‐
acting with Polish material, is an example of Foreigner without translator metaphor.
Indexes representations (which evokes the secondness of their referents) such as
links lead participants to anticipate possibilities to learn more about a foreign culture.
Finally, symbolic representations (which evokes the thirdness of their referents) strongly
mediated the contact with foreign elements by giving explanations, comparisons to the
users.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings point at congruencies among the user’s perceptions at
interaction time and our categorization of cultural diversity perception (see Table 1).

Conclusions
Given the multifaceted nature (beliefs, values, ethnicity, regional and so on) of HCI, this
paper presents a characterization of possible indirect intercultural encounters that may
take place in HCI by using two related approaches: Peirce’s type of signs and CVM, a
conceptual tool of Semiotic Engineering [4, 15].
This research worked on the eﬀects the elaboration and protocol of cultural compo‐
nents (signs, in Semiotic terms) in the interactive discourse may promote on users’
perception. This research demonstrated the causal relation between the semiotic engi‐
neering with icons, indexes and symbols and the potential consequences of them to the
users’ levels of perception and knowledge about cultural diversity.
Others HCI researches have used Peirce’s Semiotic approach. Mihai Nadin, for
instance, applied that paradigm to interface design in the late 1980s with a fundamental
conclusion for interface design as such: ‘since the technology upon and for which we
build interface changes very rapidly, pan-logical semiotic principles, in their breadth
and depth, provide a foundation for improved interface design [22]. Joost and Hemmert,
in Design, also investigated Tangible User Interfaces in light iconic, indexical and
symbolic representations [23].
In conclusion, this work shows that semiotic engineering of cross-cultural systems,
i.e., the elaboration of an interactive discourse that communicates opportunities for
intercultural encounters, may be viewed as a matter of promoting cultural unawareness,
Characterizing Intercultural Encounters
117

awareness or experience. The current Semiotic Engineering ontology considers (so far)
three classes of signs in the designer’s deputy’s interaction discourse: static, dynamic,
metalinguistic [18]. With this view we are opening a theoretical implication of thinking
in classes of cultural signs in terms of the promotion of cultural unawareness, awareness
or experience. This allow us to characterize HCI more precisely and deeply, illuminating
subtle issues in cross-cultural HCI design research.
In the near future, we will be working on the improvement of CVM scaﬀolds in order
to improve this epistemic tool usability and explore the categories proposed in this work
in design studies.

Abstract. Direction of others’ gaze can guide one’s attentional orientation, an
eﬀect called the gaze-cueing eﬀect. The present study examined relationships
between the gaze-cueing eﬀect and general trust (i.e., a cognitive bias in benev‐
olence of human nature) across participants in the United States and Japan.
American participants voluntarily followed the non-predictive cueing gaze irre‐
spective of their general trust, while Japanese participants voluntarily ignored the
gaze in response to the levels of their general trust. These results were largely
consistent with the previous suggestion that Westerners tend to focus on an object
independent of its context while Asians tend to attend the context and implies that
individuals’ general trust levels may modulate early-stage visual processing such
as detecting a visual object.

Introduction
A basketball player can pass the ball to another player without directly looking at the
player (so-called “no-look pass”), to trick opponent players. This example shows one
aspect of human visual processing in the context of interpersonal nonverbal communi‐
cations. More speciﬁcally, the visual system serves to modulate attentional orientation
in response to others’ social cues, i.e. socially relevant stimuli, such as pointing gesture,
eye-gaze direction, head orientation, or body orientation [1–7].
Previous research examined how the gaze perception inﬂuences observers’ atten‐
tional orientation [2, 3]. Friesen and Kingstone [3] presented the face stimulus with gaze
directed to the left or right side at the center of the display, and then a target dot on either
the left or the right side of the face. They asked participants to press a button as soon as
they detected the dot regardless of the direction of the cue. They found that when the
target appeared at the cued direction, the reaction times (RTs) were shorter, as compared
to when the target appeared at the opposite side from the gaze direction, an eﬀect termed
the gaze-cueing eﬀect. The fact that this eﬀect occurred even when a stimulus-onset
asynchrony (SOA) between the gaze and target was short (around 100 ms) indicates that
the visual system automatically and involuntarily directs attention to a side of the visual

ﬁeld that the gaze is directed to. In other words, the visual system automatically and
involuntarily directs attention to the direction of the gaze, potentially demonstrating the
reﬂexive nature of human sociality. Advancing this knowledge, Bayliss and Tipper [8]
reported the evidence that the reliability of gaze direction (i.e., how often each face
stimulus looked to the target location) can inﬂuence observers’ personality judgments
of each facial identity. Their experiment contained three types of faces; faces always
directing their gaze to the target (predictive-valid faces), faces always averting their gaze
from the target (predictive-invalid faces), and faces directing and averting their gaze to/
from the target with equal proportions (non-predictive faces). After the experiment,
participants evaluated predictive-valid faces as more trustworthy than predictive-invalid
faces. Their results indicate that their perception of the gaze that contains behaviorally
relevant information can modulate evaluation of trustworthiness.
Although the previous study has shown that gaze perception alters observers’
personality judgment [8], it is unclear how the observer’s personal tendency aﬀects gaze
perception or the following cognitive processing. The present study examined the rela‐
tionship between the gaze-cueing eﬀect and observers’ general trust. General trust is a
cognitive bias or a belief in benevolence of human nature in general, a construct known
to diﬀer across individuals in Japan and the United States [9]. Also, it is suggested that
people who have higher general trust are more likely to be deceived by others [10]; in
contrast, people who have lower general trust are less likely to be deceived by others.
Therefore, investigating whether general trust predicts the magnitude of the gaze-cueing
eﬀect would provide us an important clue about at which stage of visual processing
personal tendency, or general trust, is determined.
To achieve this goal, two independent approaches were adopted in this study. First,
we manipulated gaze-target SOAs to investigate at least two types of attentional orien‐
tation [11, 12]. One is top-down, or goal-directed, selection of information, in which the
visual system directs attention based on the observer’s current goals or intentions. This
type of attentional orientation is achieved endogenously or voluntarily, and thus requires
a long gaze-target SOA (around 700 ms). The other is bottom-up, or stimulus-driven,
selection, in which stimulus properties exogenously or involuntarily capture attention,
irrespective of the observer’s current goals or intentions. This type of attentional orien‐
tation is achieved with a short gaze-target SOA (around 100 ms). Therefore, the ﬁrst
goal of this study is, by manipulating the SOAs, to isolate the inﬂuence of general trust,
if any, on visual processing that is involuntary or voluntary.
Second, this study further examined cultural eﬀects on the relationship between the
gaze cueing eﬀect and general trust. Previous research indicates that Westerners tend to
focus on a salient object independent of its context while Asians tend to attend the context
[13]. More speciﬁcally, individuals engaging in North American cultures are more
capable of ignoring contextual information and those engaging in Asian cultures are
more capable of incorporating contextual information [14]. If so, American observers
should process the cueing gaze analytically (or in a stimulus-driven manner), and thus
the eﬀect of general trust (or context) may not emerge whether visual processing is
voluntary (with shorter SOAs) or involuntary (with longer SOAs). On the other hand,
Japanese observers should process the cueing gaze holistically (or in a context-based
Do You Trust One’s Gaze
121

manner), and thus the eﬀect of general trust (or context) may emerge especially when
visual processing is voluntary with longer SOAs.

Experiment 1: Eﬀects of General Trust and SOAs on Attentional
Orientation for Japanese Participants
2.1
Method
Subjects. Thirty Japanese adults (14 males, age range 18–23 years) were recruited from
Rissho University, Japan. They reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity.
They were blind to the purpose of the study.
Stimuli. Stimuli mirrored those used in [3], and were drawn in black on the white back‐
ground. A round face subtending 6.8° contained two eyes (two circles subtending 1.0°),
one nose (one circle sub-tending 0.2°), and one mouth (one straight line of 2.2° in length).
The two eyes were separated by a gap of 2.0° with each other, and were located 0.8°
above the central horizontal axis. The nose was located at the center of the display and
the mouth was located 1.3° below the nose. The black pupils (two ﬁlled-in circles
subtending 0.5°) were used as cues, by just touching left or right in the eyes. A black
dot subtending 0.6° were used as a target, which located 5.9° left or right from the
ﬁxation (a red dot).
Procedure. First, general trust was measured using the general trust questionnaire [9]
that contains 6 items as below.
• Most people are basically honest.
• Most people are trustworthy.
• Most people are basically good and kind.
• Most people are trustful of others.
• I am trustful.
• Most people will respond in kind when they are trusted by others.
Participants answered these questions with 7-point Likert scale respectively
(1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Next, participants were asked to perform a
speeded detection task with gaze cueing that was task-irrelevant. After participants
pressed the space key, the ﬁxation point was presented at the center of the display for
500 ms (Fig. 1). Then, the face outline without black eyes was presented. After the
duration of 900 ms, black pupils were added to the face outline and indicated the gaze
direction, left or right. With an SOA of either 117 ms or 700 ms, the target dot was
presented at the left or right side of the face. Participants reported the location of the dot
as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants were informed in advance that gaze
direction did not predict the target location (validity = 50 %). The catch trials were also
intermixed, in which an open circle was presented on behalf of the face outline, and
participants were required to withhold their responses. Participants performed 384
experimental trials in total (128 trials in each the valid, invalid, and catch condition).

(ANOVA) with these data demonstrated the signiﬁcant main eﬀects of condition
[F(1,29) = 8.69, p < .01] and of SOA (F(1,29) = 160.46, p < .01]. The interaction was
signiﬁcant [F(1,29) = 23.17, p < .01], which was elicited by the signiﬁcantly shorter
RTs in the valid versus invalid condition at the 117-ms SOA [357.12 ms (valid) vs.
370.72 ms (invalid); F(1,29) = 35.02, p < .01], and by no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
RTs between the conditions at the 700-ms SOA [315.08 ms (valid) vs. 313.55 ms
(invalid), F(1,29) < 1].
Correlation Between the Gaze-Cueing Eﬀect and General Trust. The magnitude of
the gaze-cueing eﬀect was calculated by subtracting the mean RT in the valid condition
from the mean RT in the invalid condition. The correlations between the magnitude of
the gaze-cueing eﬀect and the general trust score (average score for the six items) were
shown in Fig. 3, for each SOA respectively. There was no signiﬁcant correlation for the
117-ms SOA [r = .02, ns.] but the marginally signiﬁcant correlation for the 700-ms SOA
[r = .30, p < .10].

Discussion
Participants reported the location of the target dot more quickly when the shortly
preceding gaze predicted the target location than when it did not, replicating the gaze-
cueing eﬀect. On the other hand, the gaze cueing eﬀect was not observed for the long
SOA. This absence of the eﬀect was likely because the participants who reported lower
124
S. Takao et al.

general trust would voluntarily and more successfully suppress perception of the gaze,
which was consistent with our prediction derived from the suggestion that Asians tend
to attend the context [13, 14]. That is, Japanese participants in Experiment 1 processed
the cueing gaze holistically (or in a context-based manner), and thus the lower general
trust helped participants with suppressing visual processing of the non-predictive gaze
direction, in order not to be deceived.
Previous research indicates that Westerners process visual items more analytically
than Asians. This hypothesis predicts that participants in the United States will demon‐
strate the gaze-cueing eﬀect regardless of SOAs because they process the face stimulus
more analytically. Furthermore, preceding studies on general trust and cultural diﬀer‐
ences indicate that general trust scores are higher among Americans than Japanese indi‐
viduals [9]. Experiment 2 repeated Experiment 1 with American participants to examine
these points.

Experiment 2: Eﬀects of General Trust and SOAs on Attentional
Orientation for American Participants

Method
Subjects. Thirty American adults (4 males, age range 18–22 years) were recruited from
Old Dominion University, VA, U.S.A. They reported normal or corrected-to-normal
visual acuity. They were naïve as to the purpose of the study.
Stimuli & Procedure. The stimuli and the procedure were identical to those used in
Experiment 1.

Results
The Gaze-Cueing Eﬀect. The analysis identical to that of Experiment 1 was performed.
Figure 4 shows the median RTs averaged over participants. The data demonstrated the
signiﬁcant main eﬀect of condition [F(1,29) = 11.95, p < .01], and also the signiﬁcant
main eﬀect of SOA [F(1,29) = 232.05, p < .01]. The interaction between these factors
was not signiﬁcant [F(1,29) < 1]. That is, the magnitude of the gaze cueing eﬀect did
not diﬀer between the 117-ms [465.85 ms (valid) vs. 478.92 ms (invalid)] and the 700-
ms SOA conditions [403.72 ms (valid) vs. 416.03 ms (invalid)].
Correlation Between the Gaze-Cueing Eﬀect and General Trust. The magnitude of
the gaze-cueing eﬀect and the general trust score were calculated as in Experiment 1.
The correlations between the gaze-cueing eﬀect and the general trust were shown in
Fig. 5, for each SOA. A negative correlation was signiﬁcant for the 117-ms SOA [r = −.
36, p < .05], but no correlation for the 700-ms SOA [r = .05, ns.].

3.3
Discussion
The gaze-cueing eﬀect was observed for the long SOA as well as the short SOA. Because
it was suggested that Westerners tend to focus on a salient object independent of its
context [13], American participants processed the cueing gaze analytically (or in a stim‐
ulus-driven manner), thus endangering the gaze-cueing eﬀect irrespective of SOAs. That
126
S. Takao et al.

is, American participants were unable to suppress perception of the gaze direction, even
though they reported lower general trust.
Interestingly, the participants with lower general trust elicited larger cueing eﬀects
when attentional orientation was triggered involuntarily with the short SOA. This
evidence presumably suggests that personal tendency, or general trust, would potentially
underpin Westerners’ analytic, or stimulus-driven, visual processing, and that the lower
general trust might reﬂexively accelerate participants to make an (over)analytic strategy
of visual processing. That said, further investigations are warranted as regards this issue.

General Discussion
The present study examined relationships between the gaze-cueing eﬀect [2, 3] and
observers’ general trust [9], focusing on cultural inﬂuences between Japanese and
American.
In Experiment 1, Japanese participants demonstrated the gaze-cueing eﬀect for the
short SOA irrespective of individual general trust, but no eﬀect for the long SOA. As
for the long SOA, the weak positive correlation between the eﬀect and the general trust
suggests that participants with lower general trust would voluntarily and more eﬃciently
suppress the non-predictive gaze direction in a context-based manner. On the other hand,
American participants in Experiment 2 demonstrated the gaze-cueing eﬀect with both
the short and long SOAs in a stimulus-driven manner. Furthermore, the eﬀect was nega‐
tively correlated with the general trust when attentional orientation was triggered invol‐
untarily with the short SOA; though no correlation was elicited for the long SOA. This
evidence interestingly suggests that participants who reported lower general trust might
reﬂexively accelerate to make an (over)analytic processing of visual information, which
might underlie Westerners’ analytic strategy of visual processing.
In general, the obtained results are well consistent with the suggestion that West‐
erners tend to focus on a salient object independent of its context while Asians tend to
attend the context [13, 14]; American participants voluntarily followed another’s gaze
irrespective of a context (or general trust), and Japanese participants voluntarily
suppressed perception of another’s gaze in response to a context (or general trust).
However, it is noteworthy that American participants potentially incorporated contex‐
tual background, or lower general trust, into reﬂexive attentional orientation. This new
ﬁnding clearly shows the diﬀerent strategies in visual processing between Japanese and
American.
Additionally, recent studies have shown that the representations of conventional,
communicative symbols, such as pointing arrows and words, can be overlearned, thus
leading to the reﬂexive orienting of visual attention [15–18]. Because the gaze-cueing
eﬀect was correlated with the general trust diﬀerently between Japanese and American
in this study, our evidence would support the concept that the gaze-cueing eﬀect is also
caused by overlearning, not by an innate tendency.
The current study has at least three caveats when interpreting the data. First, inconsis‐
tent with the previous works on general trust and cultural difference, American partici‐
pants rated general trust scores lower than Japanese participants [t(58) = 4.41, p < .001].
Do You Trust One’s Gaze
127

At the two sites, due to the requirements of each institution, participants were recruited
differently, which might have caused this unexpected difference on general trust scores.
Second, the variance of the general trust scores for American participants appears smaller
than the Japanese participants (0.99 vs. 0.53), which could have contributed to the signif‐
icantly negative correlation between the gaze-cueing effect and general trust for the 117-
ms SOA condition for American participants. Future research should ensure that the
variances of the scores between the two sites are comparable. Finally, the grant mean RTs
were substantially longer for American participants than Japanese participants [441.13 ms
vs. 339.12 ms; t(58) = 7.14, p < .01] although the experimental settings such as timing of
stimulus presentation and response collection were identical. Speculatively, American
participants might have been more conservative in making a judgment especially when
they voluntarily controlled their attention at the longer SOA. In fact, American partici‐
pants did show the gaze cueing effect at the longer SOA, which could have contributed to
this difference in the grand means. Nevertheless, future research could explore the source
of the difference in the speed of visual judgment for individuals across different cultures.

Abstract. Text CAPTCHAs are widely deployed in nowadays for websites to
defend malicious attacks. Although most text CAPTCHAs employ alphanumeric
characters, there are emerging interests in designing CAPTCHAs based on
regional languages. Here, we conducted experiments to compare the usability of
CAPTCHAs based on English and Chinese. The results indicate that, comparing
with CAPTCHAs that employ random English or Chinese characters, those based
on frequently-used English or Chinese words provide the best usability in terms
of eﬃciency, eﬀectiveness and satisfactory for participants who are native
Chinese speakers while familiar with English. CAPTCHAs based on random
Chinese characters, however, is least user-friendly from a comprehensive
perspective. The evaluation method and results presented here may shine a light
for the design of CAPTCHAs that employ characters other than alphanumeric.

Introduction
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
Apart), with its aim to distinguish human behavior from automatic scripts, is now widely
used for online systems, particularly in registration and password veriﬁcation scenes
[1, 2]. For instance, Gmail employs it to ﬁlter out spammers; Facebook would beneﬁt
from preventing fake accounts and junk messages; PayPal utilizes it to enforce the
ﬁnancial security of its users and so on.
Principally, a well-designed CAPTCHA is expected to be easily recognized by
humans while hard for bots to crack. Since its invention in 2002, CAPTCHAs in nowa‐
days generally fall into three categories [3]: Text, Image and Voice. Given that Text
form is the dominant one [4] and the focus of this paper, the word CAPTCHA mentioned
afterwards represents only the text kind unless otherwise speciﬁed. Typically, a
CAPTCHA includes several alphanumeric characters which are distorted and/or over‐
lapped with each other, together with strikethrough lines and noise backgrounds [5, 6].
In this way, computer algorithms will have diﬃculty separating characters from one
another and identifying them individually. With the increased complexity of those
designs, it is more eﬃcient to defend automatic scripts [5] but also at the cost of degraded

usability. Therefore, it’s essential to study the usability of text-based CAPTCHAs with
a variety of design complexities.
For instance, Chellapilla et al. [7] investigated the design factors that could balance
between usability and security. Elie Bursztein et al. [8] identiﬁed a set of features of
alphanumeric CAPTCHAs and classiﬁed them in to three categories—visual features
(character sets and counts, font sizes, etc.), anti-segmentation features (character over‐
laps, random dot sizes, etc.), and anti-recognition features (rotated character counts and
degrees, etc.), then further investigated their eﬀects on the usability of alphanumeric
CAPTCHAs. Lee [9] compared the usability of alphanumeric CAPTCHAs for native
Chinese speakers of diﬀerent ages and revealed that young group had better performance
than the old group. Belk et al. [10] evaluated the eﬀects of cognitive styles on people’s
performance of CAPTCHAs. They pointed out that, when designing a user-friendly
CAPTCHA, not only should the intrinsic factors like noise, mask line, etc. be taken into
account, but also some variables on a user’s side such as his/her cognitive style, culture
background, etc.
However, all those studies on the design and usability of CAPTCHAs are predom‐
inantly focused on those employing alphanumeric Characters. Under the background of
globalization, there is also an increasing concern about designing localized CAPTCHAs
that employ the regional languages. Shirali-Shahreza [11] designed a type of text
CAPTCHA that employed Persian/Arabic characters with improved security and
usability. Yang [12] explored the application of Korean characters in text CAPTCHAs,
their results showed that the Korean CAPTCHAs could be easily understood by native
Korean speakers while diﬃcult to be defeated by OCR (Optical Characters Recognition)
programs. Banday [13] investigated the usability of CAPTCHAs based on Urdu, one of
the regional languages used in India. The results indicated that, for native speakers of
Urdu who had few or no familiarity with English, they solved Urdu CAPTCHAs signif‐
icantly faster and more accurately than those based on English. Shortly, localized
CAPTCHAs are generally believed to provide better usability because people are intui‐
tively more comfortable with their native languages.
Meanwhile, CAPTCHA designs that employ Chinese characters are also emerging
and have already been deployed by leading internet companies, such as Baidu.com and
Renren.com, the counterparts of Google and Facebook in China, respectively. Paralle‐
ling with those deployments, Wang [14] proposed a Chinese CAPTCHA design that
added a semi-transparent layer of Chinese characters as the background of the main layer
and further experimentally proved that it was an eﬀective means against OCR. Shen
et al. [15] explored a multiscale corner structure model that was capable of hacking
Chinese CAPTCHAs, which was insightful to improve the security of Chinese
CAPTCHAs. Studies of Chinese CAPTCHAs are mainly about their mechanism [16–
18], the usability of such localized CAPTCHAs, however, has hardly been explored,
particularly, its diﬀerence with respect to those based on English characters.
Here, we investigated and compared the usability of CAPTCHAs based on English
and Chinese for Chinese users. This study focuses on the following questions: Would
the subjects have better performance when interacting with CAPTCHAs that use their
native language? What are the subjects’ perceptions about those localized designs?

Method
2.1
Participants
Thirty participants (13 males and 17 females), who are native speakers of Chinese with
English as a familiar second language, were recruited for current studies. Their average
age was 21.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3. All participant were students from
Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 9 of them were undergraduate students and the
remaining were graduate students. All participants had passed the College English Test
Band 6, a language proﬁciency test held by the Ministry of Education of China. There‐
fore, they were all familiar with the English words appeared in current experiments. In
addition, each participant was an experienced computer user who spent at least 2 h per
week on word processing with keyboard and mouse. During online activities, all subjects
had encountered English CAPTCHAs, and 29 of them had experienced Chinese
CAPTCHAs. None of them had trouble reading on the screen or operating the input
devices of computer.
2.2
Apparatus
The experiments were conducted in a lab environment. All participants were instructed
to solve CAPTCHAs on a same setup, which included a 20-inch liquid crystal display
with a resolution of 1440 * 900, a computer running Windows 8.1 system, a set of regular
QWERTY keyboard and mouse as the input devices. The input software for Chinese
characters was Microsoft Pinyin, which was daily-used input method for all participants
and also the pre-installed input method of Windows 8.1. The tilt angle, height and
distance of the display and chair were adjusted by participants to comfort themselves.
The CAPTCHAs were generated on a remote server and loaded in the form of a webpage
to the local browser, which was Google Chrome in this study. After the CAPTCHA test,
each participant was also required to ﬁnish an online questionnaire and interviewed to
learn their subjective opinions regarding those CAPTCHA designs.
2.3
Tasks
All participants were required to ﬁnish three consecutive tasks: Firstly, each participant
was required to get familiar with the experimental apparatuses through solving ﬁve
CAPTCHAs prepared for testing purpose. After that, four types of CAPTCHAs were
presented for participants to solve one by one and each type of design included 12
randomly generated CAPTCHAs. Finally, participants were asked to ﬁnish an online
questionnaire and interviewed to learn their subjective perceptions about the CAPTCHA
designs in the experiments.
2.4
Study Design
To compare the usability of English and Chinese CAPTCHAs for Chinese users, four
types of CAPTCHAs, which were based on Random English Characters (REC),
132
J. Yu et al.

Frequent English Words (FEW), Random Chinese Characters (RCC) and Frequent
Chinese Words (FCW) and illustrated in Fig. 1, respectively. REC and FEW designs
utilized English characters RCC and FCW employed Chinese characters. For each
language, the characters were presented as either random characters (REC, RCC) or
words (FEW, FCW) that are frequently used in daily life. All other design factors were
kept the same. For instance, each CAPTHCA was 230 pixel in width and 70 pixel in
height. The font size was the same for all designs and the font family employed was
Microsoft Yahei, which supports both English and Chinese Characters. The characters
displayed on each CAPTCHA had a transparency of 25 % while were surrounded by 3
random lines and the same background noise levels. The distortion of each character
was also kept the same by setting the same parameter. Furthermore, although each
English CAPTCHA included 8 letters while the Chinese one included 3 or 4 characters,
the average keystrokes [19] required for their inputs were the same under current exper‐
imental setting. Therefore, it maintained a similar workload to input diﬀerent
CAPTCHA types and was expected to provide a similar condition to evaluate the solving
time of diﬀerent designs.
Fig. 1. Illustration of Text CAPTCHA styles explored in current study: (a) Random English
Characters (REC); (b) Frequent English Word (FEW); (c) Random Chinese Characters (RCC);
(d) Frequent Chinese Word (FCW). These CAPTCHAs were generated through a re-developing
of the widely-used Securimage code [20].
During the experiment, only one CAPTCHA was presented on the web interface
each time. Each participant was instructed to recognize, input and submit the characters
shown on that CAPTCHA, which simulated the general CAPTCHA veriﬁcation scene
used by most websites in nowadays. After submitting his/her recognition result, a record
will be generated on the remote server, indexing the solving time, the user input and
whether the CAPTCHA was correctly input. Meanwhile, the webpage refreshed auto‐
matically and the participant was directed to solve the next CAPTCHA till the end of
the task cycle, which included 48 CAPTCHAs in total, 12 for each kind. The collected
data were further analyzed to obtain the average solving time and correction rate for
each type of CAPTCHA design.

133

The usability of each CAPTCHA design was evaluated by three independent vari‐
ables of usability [21]: eﬀectiveness, eﬃciency and satisfaction. The eﬀectiveness and
eﬃciency were measured by the average solving time and correction rate for each type
of CAPTCHA, respectively. The satisfaction was obtained through an online question‐
naire and a face-to-face interview with each participant.
2.5
Procedure
The experiment was carried out in three stages—experiment preparation, testing and
interview. During the preparation stage, we reset the testing apparatuses and described
the purpose and tasks of the experiment to each participant, who was also informed that
this test was anonymous and any data collected would be restricted for the use of current
study only. After that, a participant was instructed to get familiar with the experiment
apparatuses through solving ﬁve CAPTCHAs prepared for testing purpose. In the testing
stage, a participant was left alone in the lab to solve four consecutive CAPTCHA sections
and one online questionnaire without any disturbances. However, the experiment
instructor would wait outside the lab in case the participant would need any tech support.
For the ﬁnal stage, participants were interviewed to learn their additional comments
about the diﬀerent CAPTCHA designs as well as their emotional feelings. After that,
each subject was given a small gift to appreciate his/her cooperation.

Results and Discussion
3.1
Comparison of Eﬃciency and Eﬀectiveness Between English and Chinese
CAPTCHAs
The average solving time for all four kinds of CAPTCHA design, which based on
Random English Characters (REC), Frequent English Words (FEW), Random Chinese
Characters (RCC) or Frequent Chinese Words (FCW), were illustrated in Fig. 2.
The solving time of FEW (M = 4.68 s, SD = 1.4 s) is essentially the same as that of
the FCW (M = 4.46 s, SD = 2.7 s). This same solving time can be explained by the fact
that all those participants were familiar with both the English and Chinese words
appeared in this study. Therefore, participants had a similar response to both kinds of
CAPTCHA design. It is also indicated in Fig. 2 that, solving RCC designs (M = 9.38 s,
SD = 4 s) takes the longest time, followed by REC designs (M = 7.75 s, SD = 2.3 s).
The results of both RCC and REC are much longer than those of FEC and FCC results.
The longer solving time for CAPTCHAs based on both random English and Chinese
characters reveals that, it took more time for participants to recognize each characters
individually and then type them into the test interface. The similar solving time for both
FEC and FCC further shows that it took basically the same eﬀort for participants to
response to their native language and a familiar second language. In general,
CAPTCHAs based on frequently-used English and Chinese words have better eﬃciency
than those employ random characters while there are no signiﬁcant diﬀerence for the
solving time of frequent English and Chinese words.
134
J. Yu et al.

The eﬀectiveness of those four CAPTCHA designs are represented by the percentage
of CAPTCHAs that were correctly solved. As shown in Fig. 3, solving accuracy for
FEW (99.22 %), RCC (97.66 %) and FCW (98.44 %) are almost the same, while REC
(74.68 %) gave a signiﬁcantly lower correction rate. The high correction rate for
CAPTCHAs based on Chinese language and English words demonstrated that there is
no intrinsic diﬀerence for participants to recognize those kinds of English and Chinese
CAPTCHAs. To understand why the correction rate is much lower for CAPTCHAs
based on REC, we further analyzed the user inputs for such kind of CAPTCHA. It turned
out that, a majority of incorrect inputs were due to the confusion of similar English
letters, such as “I” and “L”. Therefore, we removed CAPTCHA inputs that contained
any confusion letters and reanalyzed the correction rate of REC, which is illustrated in
Fig. 4. It is clear that, without those confusion letters, the correction rate of CAPTCHAs
based on REC has been improved by more than 10 %. Even without those confusion
letters, however, the correction rate of REC is still at least 10 % lower than the other
three designs. This is because the random lines and back ground noises, which were
integrated for an improved security, sometimes would partially merge with the English
characters, making them diﬃcult for participants to identify correctly. While for English
words, even though one or two letters of a word were masked, it was still possible for
participants to recognize that word as a whole and correctly solve it. Therefore, the eﬀect
of random lines and background noise is more pronounced on REC design than FEW
one. Furthermore, due to its complexity, even if most part of a Chinese character was
blurred by the random line and background noise, participants had no diﬃcultly recog‐
nizing it as a whole and therefore it maintained a high correction rate. Brieﬂy, the
correction rate is lowest for REC while quite good for FEW, RCC and FCW
CAPTCHAs.

Satisfactory Questionnaire and Interview
In addition to the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness studies, each participant was also required
to ﬁnish a questionnaire and interviewed to acquire their subjective opinions toward
those four types of CAPTCHA designs. The results reveal that more than 97.3 % of the
participants preferred to solve CAPTCHAs based on frequently used words rather than
random characters. They believed that those CAPTCHAs could be easily recognized
with just a single glance. On the contrary, for CAPTCHAs based on random characters,
they would have to recognize each character individually and therefore it took more
136
J. Yu et al.

eﬀorts to solve them. When asked which of the four kinds of CAPTCHAs they prefer
to solve the most, 56.07 % of the subjects were in favor of CAPTCHAs based on English
words while the remaining 43.3 % were in favor of Chinese. The subjects who supported
English words felt it was more natural and straightforward to type English words because
they do not need to switch the input method between English and Chinese. For those
who preferred CAPTCHAs based on Chinese words, they felt more comfortable with
native language and the Pinyin input methods in nowadays are smart enough to make it
fast to type Chinese. Although more than 78 % of the participants believed that
CAPTCHAs based in random Chinese characters provided the most security, there were
hardly any participant who was willing to encounter such type of CAPTCHAs.

Conclusion
The usability of CAPTCHAs based on English and Chinese were compared through a
usability study conducted with participants who were familiar with both languages.
Within the framework of similar design factors such as font size, font family, amount
of distortion, random lines, background noise level and typing workload, it was found
that, the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of CAPTCHAs based on frequently-used English
or Chinese words are similar while better than those based on random English or Chinese
characters. CAPTCHAs based in random Chinese characters, however, turned out to
provide the least overall usability. And the satisfactory questionnaire and interview
showed that participants also preferred to encounter CAPTCHAs based on frequently-
used words. In a word, comparing with English CAPTCHAs, Chinese also boasts the
potential of serving a user-friendly CAPTCHA design. Therefore, the study presented
here supports the application of Chinese CAPTCHAs to a large extent.

Abstract. In this study we developed an instrument to measure disengaged and
chaotic experience of multitasking interaction with multiple smart devices. An
online survey was conducted in a sample of 380 valid respondents. Via
exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis in equal-size subsets of the col-
lected sample, we constructed a model with ﬁve factors with an acceptable
goodness-of-ﬁt. The ﬁve factors were: Confusion (CF), Flow experience (FE),
Complexity and disorientation (CD), Time distortion (TD), Situation awareness
(SA). This instrument provides a method to gain insight on how people behave
and feel in multitasking contexts and it is beneﬁcial for designing and evaluating
information infrastructure to support people’s multitasking behaviors.

Introduction
Multitasking interaction with multiple smart devices has become a prevalent phe-
nomenon in the era of ubiquitous computing. The development of various smart devices
makes it possible to sequentially or simultaneously interact with multiple smart devices.
A survey by Hollywood Reporter showed that 79 % of the respondents always or
sometimes visited Facebook while watching TV and 41 % tweeted about the show they
were watching and three quarters said that they posted about TV while watching live
shows [1]. American teenagers from 8 to 18 years old spent 29 % of the media use time
using two or more media concurrently [2]. Besides for entertainment purposes, multi-
tasking is prevalent in working contexts. It is shown that people’s attention duration on
the computer screen is only 1.25 min on average [3], meaning that people are easy to
switch their attention away from their primary task and attend to interruptions.
Although multitasking interaction with multiple devices serves various needs of
multitaskers [4, 5], evidence suggests that multitasking has negative impacts. Multi-
tasking happens accompanied by attention switching between primary works and
interruptions. As people resume working from irrelevant interruptions from a different
device, they need to exert effort to reorient to the original context. This extra cognitive
workload generated in this process hinders individuals’ motivation, ability and
opportunity to process the primary media content [6]. As people’s limited attention
resources are strained in this process, their performance is degraded [7]. In addition,

multitasking causes high levels of stress [8], described as “a complex and often
stressful media experience” [9].
Due to the potential harm to multitaskers, an understanding of how people’s
attention gets distracted and how the negative experience is produced is necessary for
helping multitaskers better interact with multiple devices and manage multiple tasks. In
previous studies concerning multitasking, physiological data collected by bio-sensors
have been used to reﬂect multitaskers’ stress levels [10] and experience sampling has
been adopted to measure accompanied mood during the multitasking process [11, 12].
These shadowing methods are suitable to monitor the trend of stress or mood for a
period of time in ﬁeld studies. However, we are not aware of any psychological
measurement, i.e. an instrument, to directly measure the negative experience in mul-
titasking contexts. Therefore, this study aims at developing an instrument consisting of
multiple key constructs to measure negative experience of multitasking interaction. The
instrument provides a method to gain insight on how people behave and feel in mul-
titasking contexts and it is beneﬁcial for designing appropriate information infras-
tructure to support people’s multitasking behaviors.

Literature Review
One study summarizes the negative experience of media multitasking from four
dimensions: inefﬁciency, enslavement, disengagement and chaos [9]. Inefﬁciency,
caused by shifting of attention from one stimulus to another, reﬂects on the deterio-
ration of task performance, which can be deﬁned and measured objectively in different
contexts. Enslavement refers to addictive habits, consequences, feelings and corre-
sponding attitudes of a multitasker from the long-term perspective. As we aimed at
developing an instrument to measure the extemporaneous negative experience on the
spot in a multitasking setting, we did not take the two dimensions into consideration in
this study. The current study merely focused on disengagement and chaos. In the
following section, we ﬁrst review previous studies of disengagement and chaos.
2.1
Disengagement
In multitasking contexts, multiple stimuli from different devices compete for individuals’
limited attention resources. Multitaskers become “disengaged and disconnected from
attending to any particular media task” [9]. When people use computers and televisions
concurrently, they attend to computers primarily compared to televisions, and they
switch between such two media with a frequency they are not even aware of [13].
Disengagement is deﬁned as “when participants made an internal decision to stop the
activity, or when factors in the participants’ external environment caused them to cease”
[14]. Its opposite facet, engagement, is characterized by a series of attributes including
challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback,
variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control [14]. A similar concept with
engagement, ﬂow experience, is an “optimal experience” when an individual completely
concentrates in an activity [15]. The ﬂow experience is the combination of feeling fully
140
Y. Zhang et al.

challenged and skillful [16]. An operational decomposition of the ﬂow experience in
multitasking contexts includes sense of control, focused attention, curiosity, intrinsic
interest and interactivity [17]. Another concept, which has delicate difference with ﬂow
experience, is cognitive absorption. It refers to total immersion into an activity, with deep
enjoyment, a feeling of control, curiosity and not realizing the passing of time [18].
Engagement, ﬂow experience and cognitive absorption all emphasize individuals’ fully
concentrated state, the opposite of which describes disengagement when processing
content from multiple media.
2.2
Chaos
Chaos is deﬁned as “an experience of disorder and upheaval” [9] accompanied by
multitasking activities. Chaos is a complicated concept consisting of various conno-
tations. The ﬁrst one is negative emotions caused by interruptions. As found in pre-
vious studies, frequent interruptions cause increasing working speed and more stress,
no matter in laboratory settings [8] or in real life [10]. Besides, frustration [8] and sense
of guilty [9] are often generated in the process of multitasking.
The other connotation refers to the inability because of mental overload. Mental
workload in multitasking contexts is higher than in single-task contexts because people
not only need to process content on each device, but also exert extra efforts to manage
and coordinate different tasks [19]. It can increase the inability to process content
effectively in multitasking contexts and make the interactivity between the individual
and multiple devices complicated [17]. For example, when people interact with mul-
tiple devices, they need to navigate tasks on each single device and switch between
multiple devices. Hence, people may feel the sense of disorientation and process
content less effectively. Besides, stimuli from multiple devices can cause interruptions
to multitaskers, creating an “attentional residue” [20], which means the residual cog-
nitive resources for a prior task when the individual has begun to work on the sub-
sequent task. Thus, multitaskers have to expend extra cognitive effort to reorient back
to the original task and the overall cognitive workload in the multitasking process is
increased [21].
No matter from emotional perspective or from the cognitive perspective, all the
studies consistently indicate that multitasking interaction with multiple devices creates
is associated with higher levels of stress and lower levels of positive mood, which is
concluded here as “chaos”.

Method
Based on previous studies, we summarized variables regarding disengagement and
chaos in multitasking contexts and adapted them into questions for composition of a
questionnaire. The questionnaire was surveyed online for data collection and then for
factor analysis so as to extract a multi-factor model to develop the instrument.

3.1
Questionnaire Design
All the questions were 5-point Likert scales. They were translated into Chinese before
being included in the questionnaire. The translations and wordings were checked and
modiﬁed by one human factors engineering PhD student and one research assistant on
psychology. The ambiguity issues were cleared up as well. The questionnaire consisted
of two parts. The ﬁrst part was a general paragraph describing multitasking interaction
with multiple smart devices followed by three concrete scenarios. It was emphasized
that multitasking interaction in real life had a much broader spectrum beyond the three
examples. So we reminded that the quantity and type of devices in multitasking con-
texts were not limited to the three examples. The second part contained 32 questions
with 16 questions regarding disengagement and 16 regarding chaos. They were adapted
from the existing literature with syntactical structure and context changes as the main
modiﬁcations. For instance, an item measuring the ﬂow experience is “I had a strong
sense of what I wanted to do” [21]. In the questionnaire, we embodied it in the
multitasking scenario as “I have a strong sense of what I want to do while engaging in
such multitasking activities”. The questions were adapted from studies by [9, 17, 18,
22, 23]. All the items can be found in Table 1, with “ENGX” or “CHAX” as the code.
“X” stands for the sequence number of its appearance in the questionnaire, and “ENG”
and “CHA” stand for disengagement and chaos respectively.
Six questions were added according to the results of an interview carried out with
three college students in China respectively who have rich experience in multitasking.
The interview was to make up for the literature’s lack of focusing on multitasking
scenarios. The interview lasted for 30 to 40 min. The participants were encouraged to
describe their real multitasking experiences and their accompanying feelings during the
process. The moderator encouraged them to elaborate their feelings related to multi-
tasking contexts. The interview was transcribed and the extracted items were noted in
Table 1 as well.
3.2
Data Collection
The online questionnaires were distributed via social media in China. RMB 5-worth of
mobile phone credit was rewarded to each respondent. Ultimately we collected 437
responses, among which 380 copies were valid.
Among the valid copies, 205 of the respondents were males, while 175 were
females. 15 respondents were not older than 20 years old, 322 respondents were between
21 and 30 years old, and 43 respondents were older than 30 years old. 20 respondents
have an education level of high school or lower, 160 of them have a university/college
degree, and 200 have a graduate or higher degree. 192 of the respondents were students.
All the valid responses were randomly divided into two groups with an equal size.
The data in the two groups were for an exploratory factor analysis and a conﬁrmatory
factor analysis respectively. Before the factor analysis, the two groups were compared in
terms of age, gender and education level. The results suggested no signiﬁcant difference
in age (t = .347, p = .729), gender (v2 = .011, p = .918) and education level (t = .124,
p = .902) between the two groups.

Results
4.1
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
The EFA was conducted to ﬁnd the structures of the factors with regard to negative
experience in multitasking contexts. The results of the Kaiser–Mayer–Olkin (KMO) test
and Bartlett’s test of sphericity were .805 and v2 = 1278.57 (p < .001), suggesting
being suitable for factor analysis. In the factor extracting and screening phase, the
following rules were carried out: extracting components with eigenvalues larger than 1
as principal component; deleting items with loadings smaller than .45 on all common
factors; deleting factors containing only one item; making the whole model explicit and
simple to explain [24–26]. All the procedures were conducted with SPSS v20.
Finally, 19 items were retained and the component matrix was obliquely rotated to
acquire a meaningful explanation of the model. The 19 items composed of six factors
and explained 66.63 % of the total variance. The six items and their corresponding items
were listed in Table 1. They were named: Confusion (CF), Flow experience (FE),
Complexity (CP), Time distortion (TD), Situation awareness (SA), Disorientation (DO).
4.2
Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
The CFA was conducted to test the model’s goodness-of-ﬁt. The CFA was conducted
with SPSS Amos v22. The models were improved according to the modiﬁcation
indices provided by Amos and the professional meanings of each factor. Besides that,
the correlation coefﬁcients between the following factors were set zero as their cor-
relation relations did not reach the signiﬁcant level in the output of the full correlated
model: (CF, FE), (SA, DO), (CP, SA), (FE, DO), (FE, CP), (DO, TD).
Goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-ﬁt index (AGFI), comparative
ﬁt index (CFI), Tacker-Lewis index (TLI) and root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) were calculated. The results were summarized at the original model row in
Table 2.
Previous research suggests that a model with GFI greater than .90 and AGFI larger
than .80 demonstrates an acceptable ﬁt [27]. It has also been indicated that RMSEA
value between .05 and .08 is acceptable. Another study has indicated that >.90, >.90
and <.06 are cutoff values for CFI, TLI and RMSEA, but the criteria for TLI and
RMSEA tend to overreject true population models when the sample size is small [28].
The model satisﬁed the criteria of the AGFI, the CFI and the RMSEA, but not the GFI
and the TLI.

Reliability and Validity
The Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients of the six factors were .852 (CF), .835 (FE), .589
(CP), .593 (TD), .546 (SA) and .601 (DO). For constructing a theoretically reliable
instrument, .7 is the cutoff threshold for the Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients. The results
showed that there were four factors in the model failing to meet the requirement.
The discriminant validity was tested on the original model. Any two factors in the
model were combined into one factor, forming a restricted model. Then the chi-square
value differences between each restricted model and the original model were compared.
As shown in Table 3, the ﬁve-factor model combing CP and DO did not have a
signiﬁcant difference with the original six-factor model in the chi-square value. That
indicated a direction of model improvement.
4.4
Model Improvement
Inspired by the results of the discriminant validity, we merged CP and DO, forming a
new dimension-reduced model. The Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient of the new factor was
.679, which showed improved internal consistency.
The goodness-of-ﬁt is shown at the modiﬁed model row in Table 2. It can be seen
that the modiﬁed model showed improved goodness-of-ﬁt compared to the original
model.

Discussion
5.1
Explanation of Factor Connotations
Via the EFA and the CFA, we constructed a ﬁve-factor model measuring negative
experience of multitasking interaction with multiple smart devices. The ﬁve factors
include: Confusion (CF), Flow experience (FE), Complexity and disorientation (CD),
Time distortion (TD), Situation awareness (SA).
‘Confusion’ describes the vacant and upheaval feelings in the engagement of
multitasking. Due to the mutual interruptions of multiple tasks and unfocused attention,
multitaskers tend to lack a clear goal and corresponding strategies and tactics. Thus,
they suffer a divided dedication and feel guilty and frustrated during the involvement.
The second factor, ‘Flow experience’, describes the extent to which multitaskers show
interest, happiness and curiosity in the multiple tasks they are involved in. The third
factor, ‘Complexity and disorientation’, is the sum of aforementioned Complexity and
Disorientation. It contains items reﬂecting the task complexity in multitasking contexts,
especially the disorientation brought by navigating between multiple devices. Multi-
taskers not only need to cope with navigation tasks within one device, but also need to
manage the coordination between multiple devices. The fourth factor, ‘Time distor-
tion’, describes the phenomenon of losing track of time in multitasking contexts. Time
distortion is usually accompanied by ﬂow experience and it happens on game players
very frequently [29]. The last factor, ‘Situation awareness’, refers to the perception,
understanding and control of what happens in a multitasking context. The ﬁve factors
all describe the extemporaneous experience on the spot in a multitasking setting.
5.2
Usage of Instrument
This instrument can provide multitaskers with a useful tool to self-exam their states in
multitasking contexts. It can beneﬁt the design of smart device and information tech-
nology service provision. It can serve as a series of design guidelines for the design of
products or services targeting at collaborative working with multiple devices. Besides,
it can be used as an evaluation tool for corresponding products or services, especially
for those products aiming at providing integrated functions across multiple platforms.
Last, this instrument can be used to evaluate the effect of intervention on multitaskers to
manage their distracting behaviors in a multitasking context.
5.3
Limitations and Future Work
The current sample size is not large enough and has a limited representativeness
because of collecting data only via social media. We cannot arbitrarily regard social
media users as multitaskers in real life. Besides, the indices adopted in this study do not
reach the realistic standard for constructing a mature psychometric instrument. The
items in each factor should be selected based on a more systematic and comprehensive
literature summarization. More thorough calculations of various psychometric indices
should be performed. Sampling in a broader range of population should be adopted in
the future research.

Conclusion
In this study we developed an instrument to measure disengaged and chaotic experi-
ence of multitasking interaction with multiple smart devices. Via exploratory and
conﬁrmatory factor analysis, we constructed a model with ﬁve factors with an
acceptable goodness-of-ﬁt. The ﬁve factors were: Confusion (CF), Flow experience
(FE), Complexity and disorientation (CD), Time distortion (TD), Situation awareness
(SA). This instrument provides a method to gain insight on how people behave and feel
in multitasking contexts and it is beneﬁcial for designing and evaluating information
infrastructure to support people’s multitasking behaviors.

Abstract. Spatial art and spatial design both requires the exploration of the
formation and elements of space before creating a physical space by combining
the elements. Then, perceptual space is formed after the incorporation of the
designer’s subjective concepts in order to gain the approval of participants or
users. Creating a spatial design mode from concrete to abstract is an issue that
should be researched to establish captivating and meaningful space. This study
explores the illustration of spatial abstract concepts and abstract time metaphor
of spatial representation from the formation of space, the deﬁnitions of physical
space and perceptual space, and the temporal factors in spatial context, proposing
a spatial design mode of concept-element-interpretation-design with diﬀerent
spatial designs.
Keywords: Metaphor · Spatial design · Interpretation · Design model

Introduction
The diﬀerence between art and design is that art allows for self-expression via mediums
while design addresses stated needs and solves problems. Art is subjective to the eyes
of the beholder while design is objective. However, in both spatial art and spatial design,
the formation and elements of space should be explored ﬁrst before creating a physical
space by combining the elements. Then, perceptual space is formed after the incorpo‐
ration of the designer’s subjective concepts.
Space is formed from the relationship between forms. Space represents the location,
direction, area, and distance of forms through the hollow part of a 3D structure. There‐
fore, space is not a part of design; it is created from the interaction of styling elements
and design principles (Jiang et al. 2007).
Elements and composition deﬁne the existence of space. For example, the porosity
of roofs and walls determines the composition of space, which can be enclosed, parti‐
tioned, or combined. The enclosure of space is determined by its elements and opening.
These elements have a major impact on the perception of spatial style and orientation.
To some degree, the partitioning and enclosing of space are diﬀerent but with closely
related features. Partitioning involves roofs, walls, and the ﬂoor and combination applies

enclosing and partitioning interchangeably for richer spatial changes. The formation of
physical space utilizes styling elements such as ceilings, walls, and the ﬂoor to express
real-life dimensions and spatial functions.
Perceptual space is presented using size of forms, layering, color contrast, and mate‐
rial transformations to depict the distance, position, and lighting of space and express
the imaginative spatial perception. Constructing physical space with concrete elements
is simple, but using concrete elements to express abstract perceptual space requires
developing conceptual creation into creative design.
Time is represented through space; therefore, time also requires space to be remem‐
bered. Time transports through changes in the land and colors. Space is the remains of
time in the natural world and is human activity in humanity (Jian 2005). As people move
in the environment, they become aware of the temporality of space, not simply by the
vastness of space, but mainly by manifesting temporal and spatial changes through the
perception of changes (Liu 2010).
According to French Marxist philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre, there are
three levels in the production of space: perceived space (spatial practice), conceived
space (representations of space), and lived space (representational spaces). Perceived
space is physical place, conceived space is mental place, and lived space is social place.
Art and literature present representational spaces using imagination to rewrite space
controlled by the objective world. Poets write poems by using their imagination through
reality, which also results in the creation of metaphors. Artists create artworks by using
their imagination in reality and their works of art are a metaphor of the artists’ imagi‐
nation.
The properties (character) and course of time (history) of space and social factors
(people in motion) are correlated. How is the character of space shaped? Time (history)
is an important factor. All things on earth need time to be created (Chen 2008).
As such, by using time factors as an inspiration for design creativity to explore the
transformation of the signiﬁcance of space caused by temporal changes, innovation and
new ideas can be evoked, forming a close connection with the local environment.

Spatial Design: From Abstract to Concrete
Design activities are considered as a series of complex design related problem-solving
processes (Goldschmidt 1997). In terms of its organization and presentation, design
problems are passive in which designers provide an active response based on the design
objective. Design problems are solved by searching and ﬁnding the solution. Jones
(1992) asserted that a design process can be classiﬁed into data collection, idea gener‐
ation and development, detailed designs, and project implementation. Archer (1984)
proposed an operable design model where he divided the design area into three stages
and six procedures while emphasizing the correlation and feedback behavior between
each procedure. The three stages include analysis, creation, and evaluation and the six
procedures include architectural planning, data collection, analysis, integration, devel‐
opment, and communication.

Form is a method in which design concepts are expressed by constructing. When an
exterior form expresses an interior meaning, this certain form then becomes an element
that represents the interior meaning.
Space refers to the perception of atmosphere created from architectural elements.
The perception of atmosphere in space plays an important role in architectural design;
it is the internal representation of an exterior form. By organizing and arranging archi‐
tectural elements, spatial perception can conform to the conceptual perception and
imagination (Hwang 2007).
Abstraction is a conceptual process in which general rules and concepts are derived.
Therefore, abstract is not just a simpliﬁcation of contour, but also includes the extraction
of essence and meaning (Norman 1998). Symbols refer to the delivery of an abstract
meaning through a certain meaningful agent, which is the symbol. However, a direct
correlation is not always evident between the meaning and symbols; sometimes it is
established by convention.
Visual message can be categorized into three functions: (1) Representation:
exploring the things people see and identify in the environment and from past experi‐
ences (in particular, photos); (2) abstract: reducing certain visual elements and empha‐
sizing direct, emotional, or original messages; (3) symbol: giving meaning. Therefore,
a spatial abstract design model involves extracting styling elements from spatial concept,
using symbols to interpret the meaning to complete the design process, as shown in the
Fig. 1.

Interpreting Abstract Perceptions with Concrete Elements
Using concrete elements to interpret abstract perceptions include illustrations of abstract
concepts and spatial metaphors of abstract concept of time. In terms of the former,
illustrated abstract concepts can be expressed by scaling up or down to display the
observer’s location, using 2D to determine 3D space or spatial contour for conversion

of meaning. Temporal dimensions are used to explore the historical meaning of space,
using temporal factors in spatial context as materials for interpreting and creating new
space.
3.1
Using Illustrations to Express Abstract Concepts in Space
Spatial illustrations are products of designers’ thinking and spatial interpretation further
enhances designers’ creative thinking. Illustrations are tangible and visually compre‐
hended by observers while interpretations are intangible and require observers to percep‐
tually experience.
In order to express space and convey ideas, designers or artists utilize various
perspectives to draw diﬀerent views. Views are produced based on the principle of
graphics, presenting real-life space or styles on paper via parallel protection according
to the observed position and direction, thereby producing top views and elevations.
Perspective drawings are produced through perspective principles. Therefore, the view‐
point and position of observers determine the way with which space is presented in
views.
Views determine perspectives. Thus, spatial design is not just a concrete illustration;
it requires the use of interpreted perspectives and methods to allow space to be easily
understood. Ways to expressing abstract concepts with illustrations include scaling
down, scaling up, 3D projecting, 2D space, and contouring.
The following sections are descriptions of land art, memorial space, installation art,
exhibition, and interior design.
3.1.1
Scaling Down to Express Macro Views
Think of our living environment as puzzles of various architectures and use 3D building
blocks to construct Taoyuan Land Puzzle and Art, in which the red 3D blocks symbolize
buildings, green 3D blocks symbolize green land and farms, large white and green
squares symbolize intertwining buildings and green spaces, and blue glass square plates
symbolize Taoyuan’s land feature, ponds. This work of art features the use of building
blocks to portray the land and environment in macro view. The design process, as shown
in the Fig. 2.

Scaling up to Emphasize the Concept of Memory
In order to search for the concept of “memory” in the history of Chung Yuan Christian
University (CYCU), enlarged books are used as the styling element to enclose the space
of Chung Yuan Christian University Chang Ching Yu Memorial Library using ceilings
and walls layered with books and pages. The purpose is to seek for the memory of history.
The physical environment of books is not the purpose of design; rather, the main signif‐
icance of design is establishing the abstract spatial concept of restoring memories to
reconstruct history. The design process was shown in the Fig. 3.

Using Projection to Establish 3D Drawings
Scaled up doorknob are used as elements to be projected on walls to present top views.
A set of doorknob cut in half metaphorized the section that cannot be seen in space. The
spatial installation art of graphics interpret the 3D projection and the undetected section
in space. The design process was shown in the Fig. 4.

Here, walls, sliding doors, and windows are the elements. The exhibition space of Space
in Painting vs. Drawing for Space is divided and enclosed with walls or with drawing
symbols on the ﬂoor to present the abstract doors and windows and portray the diﬀerent

Using Contouring to Extract Styles
Irrigation ditches are chosen as the elements and contours are used to symbolize ﬂowing
water. The Taoyuan City Library uses the ceiling and ﬂoor patterns, bamboo slips, and
wavy design counter irrigating the books in the library to symbolize the features of
irrigation ditches in Taoyuan. The design process was shown in the Fig. 6.

3.2
The Temporal Factors in Spatial Representation
“Representation, or exhibition, aims to allow people to understand its inner meaning as
well as its exterior appearance by displaying. Here, the presenter, or exhibitor controls
the initiator, not the audience” (Han 2000).
Representation refers to the whole manifestation, not the sum of exhibits. People are
closely related to space. From a user-centered perspective, this study explores people’s
purpose and demands towards appreciating art or design in diﬀerent spaces. Exhibitions
can be viewed as text, using a unique language to convey its desired message (Chang
2011).
158
L.-Y. Chen and Y.-J. Gao

Exhibition design preserves and interprets diﬀerent cultures by displaying historical
events or current nature and art so as to connect visitors with culture and promote
exchange. Curation is an important part of exhibition design. A creative way to develop
exhibition design from theme planning and storylines to spatial design is to inﬂuence
people with the atmosphere and narrate with space.
Spatial presentation, circulation arrangement, narrative text, and spatial shaping
create resonance with the audience, further giving visitors a better understanding
towards the occurrence of the event. Designers need to consider the interaction between
the audience and the environment and pay attention to the connection between exhibits
and space. As a result, space is able to deliver information on the exhibition by inter‐
acting.
Temporal factors control spatial context, exploring the meaning of space through the
sequence of time to interpret and create new spaces.
3.2.1
The Reading Sequence of History
Commemorative space is used to honor or preserve the memory of a historical ﬁgure or
event. The reading sequence of a person’s life or an event represents time. The Chang
Ching Yu Memorial Hall in Chung Yuan Christian University was designed with the
concept of “turn a page of history and open the door to his life.” The life of Chang Ching
Yu is narrated in 12 chapters, which are designed as panels place on the walls for visitors
to read as if reading from the pages in a book.
By means of telling a story on 3D pages and using digitally processed portraits on
glass doors, visitors can get an insight into the life of Chang Ching Yu, surrounded by
a sea of books on the ceiling and walls. Space shown as Fig. 7.

3.2.2
Contrast of a Historical Figure and Scene
In Space in Painting vs. Drawing for Space, the diﬀerence between the years in which
the artworks were completed serves as a metaphor for the changes of the divisions at
the exhibition venue reﬂecting history. With paintings and drawings as the main char‐
acters of a story, each space contains diﬀerent paintings and designs to explain the
meaning of the divisions. The four divisions include the space of history, the space of
modern, the space of imagination (designer), and imagination of space (artist). Space
shown as Fig. 8.

159

Fig. 8. Contrast of a historical ﬁgure and scene (Art Exhibition)
In the space of history, a painting by Song Dynasty artist Zhang Zeduan Along the
River During the Qingming Festival and the version by ﬁve Qing dynasty court painters
and One Hundred Stallions by Guiseppe Castiglione in the Qing Dynasty are displayed
to portray the historical changes of Chinese paintings in the interpretation of space and
the viewpoints of painting in diﬀerent times in history including visual angles, graphics,
and lifestyles.
In the space of modern, hand-drawn maps of Taipei by British talent Tom Rook and
Chen Chien-Jung’s masterpiece of modern city from an architectural perspective serve
as metaphors for the changes in exhibition divisions and time with the sliding doors and
ﬁxed window drawings.
In the exhibition, cities painted by artists and space created by the designer form a
drawing that represent time, giving visitors the chance to personally experience the
drawing and space from the works of art.
3.2.3
Changes in Life
Ponds vs. Houses explores temporal factors in spatial context. “Shinwu” is a current
geographic name and also the record of past development. New houses in history trans‐
forming into ancient houses in geography represents an exchange of time. Fan-jian Clan
Ancestral Shrine, located in Shinwu, and apartment buildings create a contrast of old
and new, traditional and modern. Space shown as Fig. 9.
Fig. 9. Changes in Life (Land art- Ponds vs. Houses)

L.-Y. Chen and Y.-J. Gao

Ponds vs. Houses Part 2—Rediscover Shangri-La continues the concept of
“weaving,” adding 3D blocks with recycled calendars and shopping mall advertisements
and the colors red, blue, yellow, white, and black to symbolize diversiﬁed thinking to
compose a Rediscover Shangri-La landscape puzzle with temporal elements and living
content.
Rediscover Shangri-La aims to inspire the audience to take action towards the envi‐
ronment. All participants choose the environment they wish to live in. “Time” is an
important element of the exhibition and “participation” changes artwork. The exhibition
displays photos taken every day and the original versions for the audience to compare
the diﬀerent changes every day and recognize their roles in the environment (Fig. 10).

Conclusion
The creative concept of space can be expressed with 2D drawings. The meaning behind
space can be interpreted by changes in style. Using concrete elements to depict abstract
thinking refers to the use of existing images from illustration to interpretation, which
can also be said as the diﬀerent levels of design creativity. Presenting space by story‐
telling is the process of organizing the order of space, using temporal factors in spatial
context to enrich the hidden elements in works of art. The transformation from the
physical space of using materials, colors, and styles to the perceptual space of using
metaphoric interpretation can enhance the levels of design to substantial perception to
psychological perception, enriching the outcomes of spatial design.

Abstract. This study aimed to develop a holistic user experience management
model for companies to evaluate and advance their management status. The
research started with qualitative interviewed with corporations in Taiwan, then
we used afﬁnity diagrams to organize interview materials, through matching
interview ﬁndings with Total Quality Management (TQM), Total User Expe-
rience Management (TUXM) is constructed to apply in local corporations. To
provide corporations with a more effective management tool, TUXM is further
paired with Corporation UX Maturity Model to generate tactical UX manage-
ment guidelines. Our model provides assessment of user experience manage-
ment from three dimensions:
1.
Include all local corporations in our model to obtain a holistic view
of the corporation UX development status in Taiwan.
2.
For each corporation to examine its UX resource allocation.

Introduction
Companies must embed the concept of user-orientation into their core management
strategy, with every department from product design to business planning and mar-
keting motivated to optimize user experience (UX). By emphasizing user interface or

product appearance, companies can highlight the importance of UX to all levels of
management.
In Taiwan, upper-level management and design teams are often divided over the
concept of user experience design (UXD). The emergence of UX teams has also
changed the original roles and responsibilities of divisions such as marketing and
development. Even senior executives who genuinely want to promote UX often have
difﬁculty fully understanding the problems faced by product designers, who in turn
struggle to comprehend how design is limited by proﬁt and efﬁciency requirements.
User experience management is a concept of design managements, which in turn is
part of business management. In this discipline, the concept of Total Quality Man-
agement (TQM) is considered by many developed nations to be an important indicator
of production quality. The term is also used to describe an ideal environment in which
every facet of an organization, from staff to strategy to information transfer, is com-
mitted to ensuring quality. The objective of this study is to develop an ideal UXD
management model, like TQM, that executives can benchmark against when executing
strategy.

Literature Review
2.1
Tqm
Ishikawa (1986) credits TQM (Total Quality Management) for the development of
quality management into a comprehensive system covering all areas beyond product
quality. ‘Total’ means that quality management is intended to encompass as many
processes and staff at every level possible. Quality refers to satisfying the requirements
and expectations of customers. Management means maintaining the ability of the
organization to strive for continuous improvement (Cohen and Brand 1993). In sum-
mary, TQM “is a management approach to long term success through customer sat-
isfaction. In a TQM effort, all members of an organization participate in improving
processes, products, services, and the cultural in which they work”.
According to Westcott (2005), the key principles of TQM are as follows:
Customer-focused., total employee involvement, process-centered, integrated system,
strategic and systematic approach, continual Improvement, fact-based decision making,
and communications.
2.2
From Design to UX Management
Design management is a business discipline that uses management theory and
methodology to manage design behavior. In the process of design and production, there
are many factors that can lead to design quality issues. Apart from senior executives
failing to properly manage product quality, design teams may also have gaps in
technology and management techniques. For example, they may not have clear design
objectives, speciﬁcations, or technology standards. They may lack knowledge and
experience in design management, or fail to properly evaluate and deliberate on design.

Quality inspections at each stage of the design process offer the obvious beneﬁt of
monitoring and controlling quality; however, they also facilitate discussion and
exchange that can enhance design quality. Consistent quality management, from initial
design to ﬁnal production, is essential to ensuring that product design is effectively
realized.
When reviewing international case studies on design management, researchers
found that many large corporations have utilized UXD management to improve their
company value. The strategy adopted by Google is 1. Integrated company design
index; 2. Development of localized design; 3. Quantitative HEART framework; 4.
Design objective – GSM model; 5. Diverse portfolios for designers, and 6. Quantiﬁ-
cation of team performance in order to improve management.
Tencent Holdings Ltd takes the approach of 1. Integrating development with design
processes; 2. Assessing each department against integration of UX metrics; 3. Set-
ting UX metrics for products; 4. Creating the role of UX General Manager, and 5.
Making UX the responsibility of all staff.
In his book Undercover User Experience Design, Cennydd Bowles (2011) high-
lights the four development stages of UX: Undercover UX, Emergent UX, Matur-
ing UX, and Integrated UX.
At the initial stage, companies are focused only on controlling costs, and executives
are entirely unfamiliar with the concept of UX. Product functions are driven by mar-
keting demands. During the emergent phase, companies begin to recognize UX prin-
ciples and engage experts to conduct usability testing on a small budget. Relevant
stakeholders also begin to take note of UX, however at this point, UX techniques and
knowledge have not yet matured.
At the maturing phase, companies have recognized the importance of UX experts
and have begun to establish UX teams and deﬁne their job descriptions, goals and
responsibilities. Executives are willing to allocate a reasonable budget to UX man-
agement, and UX teams have access to various tools and methodologies to achieve
business objectives. In the ﬁnal integration phase, executives have acknowledged the
value of UX and believe that it is the responsibility of all employees. Senior man-
agement work to integrate UX with corporate development strategy, product devel-
opment is driven by user requirements, and the entire company progresses towards
becoming a customer-centric organization.
Van Tyne (2009) developed the Corporate User-Experience Maturity Model to
assist companies in more effectively managing UX. The model progresses through a
sequence of stages: (1) Initial stage; (2) Professional Discipline;(3) Managed;
(4) Integrated UX, and (5) Customer-Driven Corporation. Aaron (2009) further deﬁned
each development phase. Companies can evaluate the maturity of their UX teams by
comparing them against the indicators of different development phases (Table 1).
Judging from previous studies, many companies in Taiwan still lack a compre-
hensive UX management tool. Although the corporate UX maturity model discussed
earlier is a management tool for UX-integrated design processes, it does not provide
speciﬁc evaluation criteria for each development phase. Also, because the model was
based on international contexts, we must consider whether it requires modiﬁcation to
suit the industrial environment of Taiwan.
The Management Model Development of User Experience
165

Using TQM and the corporate UX maturity model as prototypes, this study built a
Total User Experience Management (TUXM) model for industry in Taiwan, incor-
porating interview data from local companies that have already embedded UX.

Methodology
In the qualitative research phase, we ﬁltered subjects by theme and conducted inten-
sive, unstructured interviews that allowed subjects to freely express their personal
viewpoints on speciﬁc topics. These interviews provided us with high quality data to
analyze and interpret (Stokes and Bergin 2006). The advantage of this method is that
interviewers can focus on exploring a single topic in-depth (Bainbridge 1989). During
March to October 2015, we interviewed 18 subjects from 13 companies.
3.1
Questionnaire Design
According to the design strategy study conducted by Bell Lab in 2011 (Ebenreuter and
Geerts 2011), design teams utilize management strategies to solve business problems.
They pointed out that design teams generally encounter four major types of event in
carrying out their everyday responsibilities:

Decision-making, simplifying problems, exploring solutions, and convergence of
differing opinions. We hypothesized that UX teams in Taiwan also encounter these
types of event, which we incorporated into our questionnaire development.
Bødker (1995) applied activity theory to the ﬁeld of Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI). This theory provides a set of principles that can be used to analyze and interpret
human activity. Activity theorists believe that we develop an object-oriented con-
sciousness of activity from our everyday doings. The activities a person engages in
indicate what objects he/she desires to understand and interpret.
An activity comprises the following six key elements: object, subject, community,
division of labor, rules, and instruments. The small triangle in the theoretical model
represents the links and intermediary effects between elements. This concept can be
used to analyze activities in the discipline of UX management.
We drafted the interview questionnaire based on the four types of event described
above and the six main elements of activity theory. This draft questionnaire was
pre-tested by experts twice and revised four times before ﬁnalization.
3.2
Afﬁnity Diagram
Also known as the KJ method, the Afﬁnity Diagram was developed by Kawakita Jirou
in 1953. After ﬁeld interviews, all the participant notes are collated and audio or visual
ﬁles are converted into transcripts. Keywords, phrases, or sentences relevant to the
activity theme are recorded on cards or notes, and then sorted into groups.

Researchers are then able to discuss common ideas or meanings, and identify
classes and group relationships. Our Afﬁnity Diagram has three main groups: Company
assets, management, and market, as shown in Fig. 1.
1. Company Assets: Clouding tangible resources, such as space and budget, as well as
intangible resources such as discourse right and company emphasis on UX.
2. Management: The experience and expertise of middle management, including the
inter-departmental management of relationships, products, and human resources.
3. Market: The UX manager must continually monitor market and industry trends, and
evaluate what threats and opportunities caused by the external environment relates
to the UX development.
4
TUXM
We matched the eight key components of TQM with the results of the afﬁnity diagram
to create the Total User Experience Management (TUXM) model, comprising the
following six elements: UX objectives, Integrated-Design System, strategic commu-
nication, Continual Improvement, Fact-Based Decision making, and a T-Type design
team (see Fig. 2).
5
Corporate User-Experience Maturity Model
The TUXM model represents the ideal elements of comprehensive UXD, while the
Corporate UX Maturity Model provides more speciﬁc benchmarks to measure capa-
bilities. We matched the interview results and TUXM elements to the Corporate UX
Maturity Model, in order to break UX maturity down into more practical criteria.
Using the method of Aaron (2009), we categorized the companies interviewed into
Fig. 3. We then re-classiﬁed the companies as shown in Table 2 based on their
management methods (Table 3).

discovered that the model can be used for three purposes:

companies in Taiwan that have integrated UX can be roughly divided into three types.
In the upper Fig. 3., companies in the same ﬁeld have the same level of maturity in UX.
Type 1: Companies in this category are developing evenly across all ﬁve man-
agement constructs, and are mostly situated in the standardization and predictive
control phases. They are less mature in user-centric design and investment from
management.
Type 2: Companies in this category are also progressing equally across all ﬁve
constructs, but are positioned mostly in the foundation and standardization phases.
However, because nearly 80 % of the companies in this table are technological
ﬁrms, the sample is not representative of the general state of UX development in
Taiwan. Once updated with further data on other industries, this table will better
represent the general trend of UX development in Taiwan, providing the government
with reference in developing UX-related policy. Study the allocation of UX resources
in companies.
Companies can use the corporate UX maturity model to (1) self-assess their level of
UX maturity, and (2) analyze their competitiveness against industry peers.
6.2
Examine Best Practice
We integrated UX best practice from international ﬁrms into this model. Companies in
Taiwan can compare their own UX development against these standards, and identify
the gap between themselves and their peers overseas.
Although we did identify several generalizable constructs from the data available,
we were unable to ﬁnd a comprehensive case study to compare all management con-
structs. Nevertheless, we hope that companies can use this model to identify their
current phase of development and where they should be investing their efforts in the
future.
Two reasons for integrating these international case studies into the model were:
1. The model could be used as an international instrument of design management.
2. Companies wanting to deﬁne their position with regards to UX development can
compare their results against model companies and identify where improvement is
needed.
7
Conclusion
The corporate UX maturity model can be used to illustrate the gap between a company
and its competitors with regard to UX development. This visualization of weak areas
highlights to other departments the necessity and practicality of corporate UX devel-
opment, encouraging cross-divisional collaboration.
Although we have identiﬁed the key constructs of UX maturity, we do not know
whether these constructs should be implemented in some type of optimal sequence, and
if so, what this sequence might be. Companies can currently use this model to evaluate
The Management Model Development of User Experience
171

their development status, but the next step would be to order these constructs by
priority. Due to time limitations, we were unable to explore this aspect.
We hope that the corporate UX maturity model will be used to provide guidance via
three types of mechanism: testing, consulting, and training.
1. Testing: The complete model allows companies to more accurately identify their
UX development status.
2. Consulting: A quantitative questionnaire could be developed to conduct a wider
survey of UX design teams in Taiwan. The results could then be used to form a
speciﬁc management plan to supplement the UX maturity model. This would assist
companies in executing strategy and engaging suitable consultants).
3. Education and training: The results of this model can be used as the basis for
developing UX Strategist training courses or corporate workshops.

Abstract. Design, in the context of Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) is
deﬁned as “an act of choosing among or informing choices of future ways of
being” (Blevis, 2007). The present paper introduces SYSTEMATEKS (SIMS) as
an evolutionary design thinking concept that has been developed and practiced
by the lead author on numerous successful and sustainable design projects for
more than two decades. These physical products have a wide range of applications
ranging from furniture, exhibitions and architectural designs that embodied
ethical, sustainable and universal values and design principles. The overarching
aim of the present paper is to document the process implicit in SIMS in a way
that it can also be practiced by Sustainable Interaction Designers. The ﬁndings of
this paper can be used as a guide to designers to ensure that the design process
will lead to sustainable and “transﬁgurable” designs that could meet a wider range
of user requirements and that also can shift application depending on the context
of use. Furthermore, this process framework can be utilized as a method of eval‐

Introduction
Design, in the context of Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) is deﬁned as “an act of
choosing among or informing choices of future ways of being” (Blevis 2007). Blevis
(2007) has proposed ﬁve principles for SID that includes:
Linking invention and disposal;
Promoting renewal and reuse;
Promoting quality and equality;
De-coupling ownership and identity; and
Using natural models and reﬂections.
These principles, even though inspired from Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
domain, share commonalities with the sustainable design principles of any physical
object.
The ultimate goal of a sustainable design (whether a physical object, a landscape,
and a piece of jewellery or a digital interactive interface) is to assure that a meaningful

and continuous relationship between user and the object is maintained and in doing so,
the product (physical or virtual) is reusable, transformative and adaptive.
The present paper introduces the philosophy of SYSTEMATEKS with its method‐
ology of Scalable Interactive Modular Simulation (SIMS) as an evolutionary design
thinking paradigm that has been developed and practiced by the lead author on numerous
successful and sustainable design projects for more than two decades. These physical
products have a wide range of applications ranging from furniture, exhibitions and
architectural structures that incorporate ethical, sustainable and universal values and
design principles. The overarching aim of the present paper is to document the process
followed by SIMS in a way that it can also be adapted by Sustainable Interaction
Designers.
This paper introduces SIMS and reviews examples of physical objects that were
developed in-line with SIMS. This review has led to development of sustainable design
processing framework. Parallels with physical and digital design realms have been
considered and their synthesis has led to development of a framework that can be adopted
by both physical/industrial designers as well as digital/HCI designers.
The ﬁndings of this paper can be used as a guide to designers to ensure that the design
process will lead to a sustainable and transﬁgured designs that could meet the wider
range of user requirements and that also can shift application depending on the context
of use. Furthermore, this process framework can be utilized as a method of evaluation
to assess the sustainability of a user interface.

Background
Sharing is the predominant way of communicating and design is the way users, designers
and developers share. It’s the interface between the inner and outer, turning sentiments
into the embodiments in the world around us. Design as a method of making things
allows us to share the world and understand the world in a harmonious and integrated
way.
Communicating design objectives are driven from epochs of three economies
(Esping-Andersen 1999), the economy of representation, the economy of abstraction
and this new economy, which we refer to as the economy of transﬁguration where the
world is dematerialized and then rematerialized again through digital technologies. A
signiﬁcant challenge persists as often these digital transﬁgurations are approached and
embodied through traditional design practices: a sequential method where designer
envisions and materializes solutions, often without considering the sociological impact
of their design and expects users (who are living in this new epoch) to welcome the
design.
Current technological advancements have allowed designers to imagine a whole host
of diﬀerent worlds, but they are often more unsuccessful than not, because they don’t
recognize all of the fundamental problems in the world. There is an urgent need for a
systems shift. A new more equitable model based on sharing is required, where users
have equal access to resources, means of production and can develop for themselves
174
L. Ferrara and N. Dadashi

designs that help them realize their full potential. This new model encourages new
understanding of the sense of ownership.
Traditional Human factors approaches deﬁne user engagement as the predominant
way of enhancing user ownership and to consequently increase the system usability
(O’Brien and Toms 2008). Co-design (Sanders and Stappers 2008), human centred
design (Huang and Chiu 2016), usability testing and many similar disciplines are at their
peak to support better end user engagement and potentially more eﬃcient user interac‐
tion. Ideally this will lead into high revenues, more satisﬁed users and change in
consumer culture. However, none provide thorough universality, as it appears that these
approaches oﬀer piecemeal solutions and lacks a holistic philosophy for design. Owner‐
ship implies property and goods, exchange and markets, accumulation and proﬁts;
sharing implies commons and a format for sharing the commons, it implies access and
data pools, and an economy of usage and experience versus an economy of goods. The
notion of economy of experience suggests the shift from physical products (which
previously could be measured through numeracy and literacy) to sensory aspects of
design. True sustainability supports this aspect of experience over possession and in
doing so promises a new type of ownership, equity, and universality while providing at
the same time individualism.
To achieve these goals there is a need for an ecology of innovation. Social innovation
(e.g. impact of mobile devices in our daily lives) and technical innovation (e.g. Internet
of Things, wearable products) are to be utilized and understood in order to develop an
understanding of business innovation (e.g. apple, android) and perhaps political inno‐
vation (e.g. Uber). The essential question is how do we make the right kind of changes.
Instead of looking at what is possible with the available technology, we need to under‐
stand what is desired and how technology can be utilized to allow us to achieve these
desires.
The evolution of design is moving away from the designer who designs for everyone
on everyone’s behalf. There is a need to design with people, where the design is no
longer monopolized under the designer, but through the creation of systems allows the
designer to empower people to create designs for themselves. This philosophy is called
SYSTEMATEKS and to do that we need to create scalable, modular, simulations for
interactions, called SIMS.
Within SIMS the process of design (although inspired from a top-down approach),
explores the bottom-top components of knowing, sharing and believing and thus forms
a balanced creation (i.e. a system of systems).
SIMS is inspired by systems thinking where design should be scalable, interactive,
modular (or “modulable”) and optimal. The idea is generally rooted in the fact that in
order to develop sustainable design, it is possible to reverse-engineer the design accept‐
ability process by users. This mainly points to the concept of design and sharing, where
users not only contribute to design (i.e. co-design), but also design has the capability to
be accessed and used by diﬀerent users (i.e. customizable) and hence allow for a wider
range of users to share a particular design proposition. This is also applicable where user
needs change over time. The resilience of a sustainable design makes it a very attractive
characteristic for digital interface designers.
SYSTEMATEKS: Scalable Interactive Modular Simulation (SIMS)
175

More speciﬁcally there is a paradigm shift, from ownership to sharing, towards the
perception, utilization and application of new interactive interfaces (physical or digital)
and to support this neo industrial perspective it is important to emphasize commonalities,
access requirements and usage (applicability). Ultimately the future of design lies in
creating systems that allow people to personalize and co-create designs for themselves
(Ferrara 2015).

Case Studies
The current paper explores two successful exemplars of sustainable product designs that
have stood the test of time. The lead author responsible for leading these design projects
reported on the evolutionary and iterative process associated with the design and devel‐
opment of the selected interfaces and searched for patterns and characteristics that
formed these designs. These case studies are brieﬂy introduced in this section.
3.1
The Benchmark
The project was started with a single dot, then turned it into a line, moved it into the
second plane, until it became a substantiated, three dimensional object. The objects were
further joined with one another, replicated again and again until an archetype element
or conceptual building block was arrived at. The archetype (Fig. 1) is like a piece of
code, it’s something that can be interpreted and used in various ways.
Fig. 1. Archetype: everything begins somewhere and ends here
The archetype was developed as a bench; this bench could be stacked to form a shelf.
Turned laterally it becomes a wall. Rotate it and suddenly you have a chair. Array them
you have a stairway. Arrange them and you have a bedframe. With other combinations,
you can have a couch and table, a kitchen, even a desk.
Benchworld can be altered, re-used, re-purposed without waste. Diﬀerent users
create diﬀerent meanings and contexts from the archetype. Put the archetype in a system,
and then users can generate their own worlds. Users can re-interpret these benches in
any shape and form imaginable (Fig. 2). A sustainable design that meets all of the criteria
that Blevis (2007) envisioned.
The design was utilized in many ways and forms and for completely diﬀerent appli‐
cations than it was originally created for. The transﬁguration of the design allowed for
no waste and since it was interpretable in many forms, it was adaptable in diﬀerent
contexts and environments. It satisﬁed users and promoted individualism through its
universality of adaptation.

The design process can be summarized in (Fig. 3) below. It is a truly iterative and
holistic approach, where there is no sequence and all elements inform one another. The
process can start from either of the components, but the important aspect is that all
dimensions/factors (context, archetype, organization and integration) should be consid‐
ered and explored.
Fig. 3. SIMS process
Context refers to understanding the work domain; list the range of high level user
requirements, breakdown of potential activities, system functions, system and product
purposes and priorities. Archetyping lets one search for fundamental building blocks
and invites the designer to think about shape, format, material, modes and forms of
interaction and in doing so develops an understanding of interaction constraints.

Archetypes are derived from understanding the origin, extending the elements and
gathering momentum, expanding the features until they become tangible and substantial,
until they become recognizable using the processes of conjunction, replication and then
ﬁnally ﬁxation until the archetype is ﬁnally developed.
The next two dimensions apply archetype and context. The ﬁrst explores various
forms of structuring and organization of the archetypes to achieve a transﬁgured design.
Examples of such activities include: interpretation, rotation, oﬀset, arrays, reset, reﬂec‐
tion, agitation, administration, materialization, dimensioning and population.
Benchmark was designed at the time with a clear brief: there was a need to furnish
a space, and hence the design albeit very ﬂexible was also very structured and this
structured format limited successful materialization and range of materialization. Users
could transﬁgure the shape by changing the content of design. The next project aimed
to manipulate the structure in a way that enhanced the ﬂexibility and transﬁguration of
the design process itself.
3.2
The Open Lattice
The open lattice (Fig. 4) was the second project that was designed based on the idea of
SIMS and lessons learned were incorporated. Open Lattice is made of two elements, a
small cross and a frame. The lattice was inspired by the identity or lack of one implicit
in the Canadian psyche, a place that would accept all and allow others to ﬂow through
it, to be changed and transformed over time.
Fig. 4. Open lattice
This addressed one of the key challenges that was faced during the Benchmark
project, where the content was somewhat ﬁxed in Benchmark by the re-contextualiza‐
tion, in the Open Lattice (due to its empty frame) the archetype itself allowed for inﬁnite
content interpretation. The increased ﬂexibility enabled a greater degree of possibilities
and transﬁguration without loosing any of the capabilities that Benchmark oﬀered.
Example of versatility of open lattice is shown in Fig. 5 below.
178
L. Ferrara and N. Dadashi

Fig. 5. Open lattice in architecture (The transportation EXPO 2012)
The only concern that resulted from the increase in ﬂexibility was a loss of structural
simplicity and consequently some of the practicality of the design. Benchmark, due to
being very structured was also very predictable and therefore more practical. The Open
Lattice due to its openness (an empty frame), is structurally more fragile and seems to
be weaker and therefore the manufacturing and assembly process needs to compensate
for this limitation. However, once it’s used, it is more resilient even though it’s not as
practical to re-arrange, it is more ﬂexible and allows content to be introduced and
swapped out over time. The risk is that it be used in so many diﬀerent ways and not all
of them can be perfectly predicted since the manufacturing requires some expert skills.
In comparison to Benchmark, Open Lattice has a user learning curve associated with
it. The question becomes whether the values oﬀered by this form are suﬃcient to
encourage users to invest in learning (acquiring some level of manufacturing skills) and
to further own the design.

SIMS Characteristics and Link to Digital Design
Looking at the two examples stated above, SIMS characteristics are identiﬁed as gener‐
ative, transformable, supports multiple materials and forms and supports alternative
designs. These characteristics should be explored and assessed during the design of
digital interfaces to ensure that the elements have the potential to be transﬁgured so that
a sustainable design is supported. It must be noted that these characteristics are mutually
exclusive and depending on the context of design various aspects of these characteristics
can be limited. However, the awareness of the extent of status of these characteristics
within the digital interface allows designers to be cogniscient of the sustainability and
ideally universality of their end digital products.

1. Generative. It can generate complex objects, environments, communications and
organizationsby capturing sentiments that can be transﬁgured into embodiments.
2. Transformable. The holonic elements are able to transform across multi-dimensions
interacting tomake larger compositions and can be manipulated by a co-creator.
3. Multiple materials. The elements can be made of multiple materials singularly on in
combination withthe material governing the scale of the element.
4. Alternative design. The elements can be stretched dimensionally and selectively
altered to response tovaries locals and the personal preferences of the co-creator.
5. Multiple forms. The combination of base elements generate multiple forms, serves
various functions,combine types of matter to create multiple eﬀects for an array of
purposes and in doingso can continue to evolve both sentiment and embodiment.
Looking at these characteristics as well as the process framework suggested in
Fig. 3, it is evident that there are many commonalities that can be adopted from SIMS
into designing digital interfaces to ensure that they are ﬂexible, universal, resilient and
consequently sustainable.
Digital interfaces are fundamentally limited to their platforms of design; designers
follow the context of use (often a very speciﬁed one) and derive detailed user require‐
ments based on available guidelines (e.g. W3C) or as a result of speciﬁc user analysis
(e.g. usability testing, Human Factors evaluation). They ensure that the forms and shapes
are noted and feasible within the digital environment and are in-line with the system
functions, purposes and priorities.
The two aspects missing in designing digital interfaces are those that contribute to
its transﬁguration. What we have called (organization and integration) in Fig. 3 are
dimensions that mainly contribute to this transﬁguration. Having these dimensions
digital designers can explore potential transformation and possible generative aspects
of their designs and ﬁnally pursue a true sustainable digital interface.

Discussion
SIMS refer to a process for a generative design comprised of holonic recombinant
elements, guided by formal, dimensional, and material systems to create evolutionary
products, scenarios, and communications that allow for collaborative creation in produc‐
tion and consumption.
SIMS can generate complex objects, environments, communications and organiza‐
tions by digitally capturing sentiments that can be transﬁgured into embodiments. These
processes consist of developing archetypal elements or holons that have been generated
by an originating concept, which can be materialized in the physical world. These
holonic elements are able to transform across multiple dimensions, interacting to make
larger compositions and can be manipulated by a co-creator.
The elements can be made of multiple materials, singularly or in combination with
material governing the scale of the element. The elements can be stretched dimensionally
and selectively altered to response to varied locales and the personal preferences of the
co-creator. The combination of base elements generates multiple forms, serves varied
180

functions, combines types of matter to create multiple eﬀects for an array of purposes
and in doing so can continue to evolve both sentiment and embodiment.
Historically, our literate means of communication started from symbols that were
ﬁrst pictographs and then alphabetic and most recently binary. The work of Alan Turing
and his Turing Machine showed that how with less (0 and 1) we could produce the most
(almost everything in the universe). This insight has inspired SYSTEMATEKS, where
you arrive at the fundamental building block and allow it to develop the most diverse
range of design possibilities. With Benchmark it was the dot and the line (which later
formed a bench) and with Open Lattice it is the frame and the cross, like a 1 and 0,
allowing you to build an inﬁnite world from the way these interact with each other.
In order to develop true sustainability, it is important to promote resilient and ﬂexible
design, however this ﬂexibility calls for user learning and the values of a design might
not be very clear to the users in order to justify their investment in the learning required
to have an impact on their lives.

Conclusion and Future Work
In the next phase of research and as a result of the fundamental goals of Systemateks it
will be critical to merge the physical expression of SIMS with the digital tool set and
interface that manages and controls it. The potential is for a digital interface that can
manipulate physical reality and help turn that physical reality into an endlessly gener‐
ative and responsive one to the evolutionary needs of people and at the same time to
allow physical reality to inform and alter the digital tool set by collecting the intelligence
of interactions in the living physical world. The result would be two generative universes
in constant relation with the other, inﬂuencing and changing each other over time.

Abstract. In this study, we introduce challenges for assisting with
everyday cooking activities. Menu planning is the ﬁrst step in daily cook-
ing, and there are many commercial services available. We introduce the
case study of “cookpad,” one of the largest recipe portal sites, and illus-
trate their eﬀorts to maintain an up-to-date recipe search system. As an
academic challenge, situated recipe recommendation is also introduced.
Food preparation is another important topic. We present our perspec-
tive based on the relationship between recipe texts and cooking activities,
along with related studies.

Introduction
Cooking is a fundamental activity in our daily lives. A good meal enriches our
quality of life, and it promotes wellness as well as provides pleasure. It can act to
ease family budgets. In some cases, a meal can have speciﬁc religious or cultural
meanings. To address these multifaceted needs, various types of improvement
to cooking and meal planning might be possible by designing systems with the
support of information and communication technology.
Daily cooking activities include regular repetition of planning a menu, prepar-
ing food, and eating. For eating, the main target for improvement concerns health
administration [1–6]. The challenge of these studies is to recognize a menu and
estimate a user’s nutritional intake from a photo taken by the user’s mobile
phone. To encourage good eating habits, Takeuchi et al. [7] designed an inter-
active tool on a social network service; users can share photos of their meals
and receive remarks from their friends via this tool. This communication tool
is designed to prompt users to make healthier menu choices, by secretly sorting
positive remarks based on the healthiness of the meal.

Design in Everyday Cooking: Challenges for Assisting with Menu Planning
183
Although there are a multitude of interesting studies concerning eating, it
is diﬃcult to introduce them all. In this study, we focus on recent attempts to
design modern applications for assisting with menu planning and food prepara-
tion, as these are activities of interest for us.
There are many recipe portal sites, and they are accessible from all over
the world, because menu planning is a task that is directly related to people’s
purchasing behavior. In spite of the universal need of recipe sites, there are
large cultural diﬀerences in recipes. As is clear from the fact that “Washoku”
(Japanese cuisine) won world heritage status in 2013, cooking has deep cultural
aspects. Religions, histories, climates, and industrial progress are all related to
local foods. A typical cross-cultural problem is translation of recipes, which is
one of the desired applications. Ingredients, culinary arts, cooking devices, and
equipment are subject to translation as well as language. In this sense, cooking
is a challenging target for cross-cultural computing.
This manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the technical
eﬀorts of a recipe portal site “cookpad”1 as a case study of a commercial assis-
tive service for menu planning. Academic challenges for menu planning are
overviewed in Sect. 3. Section 4 summarizes assistive systems for food prepa-
ration from the viewpoint of the relationship between recipe texts and human
actions. Finally, Sect. 5 presents the conclusion.

Challenges in a Company
In this section, we describe challenges faced by cookpad, an Internet site com-
prising over 2.2 million recipes as of January 2016, making it one of the largest
recipe sites in the world. Of the many challenges faced by the site, we speciﬁcally
introduce those that are closely related to academic research.
Recipe Search.
Like general recipe sites, cookpad provides users with a search
box to help them ﬁnd recipes eﬃciently. Because recipes in cookpad are written
in Japanese, which is a language that does not delimit words by white-spaces,
morphological analysis is necessary to recognize words in the recipes. The ana-
lyzer in cookpad uses a manually maintained dictionary consisting of a vast
number of food-related words. In the recipe search, synonymous expressions are
also recognized using a domain-speciﬁc synonym dictionary, which is also main-
tained manually.
Recipe Classiﬁcation.
To ﬁnd recipes, it is not suﬃcient merely to provide a
search box. In cookpad, recipes are automatically classiﬁed into various cate-
gories (e.g., meat dishes, seafood dishes, vegetable dishes) and users can limit
their search results using this information. The classiﬁcation is based on a
machine learning method (using support vector machines) where tens of thou-
sands of recipes are used as labeled data. To ensure service quality, the precision
for each category is maintained at 90 % or above so that users can ﬁnd relevant
recipes easily.

Content Selection.
Search results consisting only of recipes may not always
satisfy the user’s information need. According to users’ queries, major search
engines show not only web pages but also other content (e.g., YouTube videos
in Google search results). Likewise, the cookpad shows not only recipes but also
various other content (e.g., tips, news, and videos related to the user’s queries).
For each query, content is selected based on a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
maximize its click-through rate.
Research Promotion.
To promote food research, cookpad has made its recipes
available [8] through the National Institute of Informatics (NII), a Japanese
Research Institute with the goal of advancing informatics research. The 1.7 mil-
lion recipes involved in this challenge are those that were uploaded to cookpad by
the end of September 2014. This data collection was released in February 2015.2
Any researcher in public institutions (e.g., university) can obtain access to the
collection for research purposes and as of January 2016, 82 research groups at
56 universities had already done so.

Academic Challenges for a Smart Recipe Search
3.1
Cooking Recipe Recommendations Using
Surrounding Information
One of the most stressful issues for homemakers is to decide the day’s menu [9].
Many homemakers browse the web to decide what they are going to cook each
day. Although most existing recipe search systems request that the user submits
a query, such as the name of the menu that they want or names of the ingredients
that they want to use [10–12], people cannot always explain the property of the
recipe that they are looking for, even if they have a preference for a recipe. To
deal with these issues, we considered that what people want to eat must strongly
depend on their daily circumstances and that a recipe cooked in a given situation
must be preferred by someone who is in a similar situation. Therefore, we have
proposed a method that recommends recipes not only according to a recipe’s
properties but also according to the user’s situation.
On the web, there are many blog-type recipes that describe not only the
recipe itself but also the reason why the recipe was selected. We analyzed 2,074
blog-type recipes which were randomly collected from “RECIPE BLOG” [13].
We found that 48.2 % blog-type recipes describe at least one reason for selecting
recipes and that these reasons could be classiﬁed into 18 categories. We then
devised an algorithm that extracts situations corresponding to the 18 categories
from a user’s life log, such as his or her tweets, and recommends recipes that
have similar reasons to the extracted ones. We evaluated the proposed method
under three ﬁctitious scenarios; in two of them, the user had vague requirements
for recipes and they could only describe their situation as “it was so busy today.”
We call it as “situational scenario.” The other had concrete requirements such as

“I bought Paciﬁc saury for a good price.” We call this a “procedural scenario.”
We input the description of each scenario into the proposed system and obtained
the top ten results. As a baseline method, we also made queries derived from each
scenario and found ten recipes that contained the queries as a part of the recipes.
Five examinees evaluated each recipe recommended by the two methods using a
ﬁve-point scale. The proposed method obtained a higher score than the baseline
method in the two situational scenarios, while the baseline method obtained a
higher score in the procedural one. Therefore, the proposed method is useful
when a user cannot make his or her requirements clear as mentioned above. For
details, please refer to [14].
3.2
Recipe Comparison Using a Recipe Flow-Graph
As will be shown in the next section, we are constructing a method to trans-
late the procedural text of a recipe into a ﬂow-graph, which will represent the
procedural workﬂow of a recipe, such as which cooking actions are performed to
which ingredients, and which ingredients are mixed with each other. Although
the ﬂow-graph introduced in the next section can be described as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG), it can be simpliﬁed to an ordered labeled tree, as shown
in Fig. 1, which we call a recipe tree, as we focus on the ﬂow related to ingredi-
ents, tools and cooking actions. A recipe tree has signiﬁcant advantages over a
recipe ﬂow-graph because it has multiple fast and eﬀective graph-matching algo-
rithms, including the editing distance calculation. Therefore, we have proposed
a method to calculate similarities (distance) between two recipes by calculating
the editing distance between their recipe trees.
In general for unordered labeled trees, including recipe trees, the problem
of computing the editing distance between two trees is diﬃcult (more precisely,
the problem is known to be NP-hard [15]). Therefore, we developed heuris-
tic algorithms specialized for cooking recipe trees. The proposed method not
only calculates the distance between two recipes but also derives the details of
their diﬀerences. Figure 2 shows the mapping result between two “NIKUJAGA”

recipes when one recipe is mapped onto the other, with minimal operation costs.
According to the result, we can easily note diﬀerences such as “the timing of
mixing meat diﬀers between the two recipes” and the action “immerse the cut
potato” in the left recipe is omitted in the right one. Moreover, we have proposed
a method to ﬁnd a common cooking ﬂow of a speciﬁc dish by extracting the com-
mon structures of recipe trees that are translated from the top ten search results
from the name of that speciﬁc dish. The details of these methods are provided in
[16]. In a related study, Wang et al. [17] also proposed ﬂow-graph representations
of recipes. They deﬁned the similarity between two recipes based on the number
of common subgraphs shared by two recipes.

Assistive Applications for Food Preparation
Recipes are important information sources in food preparation. People prefer to
eat a diﬀerent menu everyday. Some external factors, such as childbirth or a sick
family member, may force us to change our repertoire of dishes. Both a variety
of recipes and comprehensive recipe presentation are important to enrich our
food preparation experience.
Figure 3 shows our image of the applications and agendas in this topic. This
perspective is inspired by machine translation via an intermediate model; this
is, once we map the recipe text and observed food preparation activities onto a
semantic model, we can directly compare the text and activities. In this sense, the
semantic model of the working process corresponds to an intermediate language
model in the machine translation problem.
A typical application is recipe generation from observation, which is
achieved by agendas C→B in Fig. 3. There are many challenges to recognizing

tions.
food preparation activities (agenda C) [18–27] and some to generating recipe
texts (agenda B) [28].
Recipe translation is realized by A→D→B. Agenda D has not yet been
studied in detail; a comparison in the structured recipe representation in Fig. 2
is the ﬁrst step of D, i.e. this study is front-line research toward this goal. As
mentioned in Sect. 3.2, the DAG (or tree) representation of a recipe is a natural
structural organization of the cooking process, and some research teams have
proposed methods to extract the structure from recipe texts (agenda A) [29–31].
Most of the challenges facing processes A and B are addressed in the Japanese
language [16,30,31], and but little in other languages [29]. For recipe transla-
tion and localization, it is important to develop these techniques in multiple
languages.
An example of a workﬂow structure provided by [30] is shown in Fig. 4 with
vertex labels (Table 1) and edge labels (Table 2). This is the ﬂow extracted from a
recipe posted on cookpad. Because recipes on cookpad are user-generated, texts
are informal and there are many diﬃculties: disparate notation, non-regularized
manners of reference, and broken contexts of descriptions.
To extract the complete structure from informal recipes, it might be useful
to complement the recipes with information derived from observation. One of
our recent trials attempted to match recipe texts and cooking observations in
the semantic model to obtain reliable and informative structural representations
of the recipes. The number of matched pairs results in statistical information
concerning human activities, i.e., the human tendency to cook a dish following
a recipe. Such information should enhance performance in systems involving
agendas A-E.
While the above applications contribute to increasing the variety of recipes,
there are a series of proposals to improve recipe presentation [18,32–38]. Most
of them [32–35,37,38] assume a simple recipe structure, which is a sequence

of steps. A few other studies use the DAG or tree structure for a more intelligent
recipe presentation [18,36].
In [18], we have forecasted the next intended step of a user via human-object
interaction on a cooking surface. A human interacts with objects to proceed
with cooking tasks. Simultaneously, the human puts objects aside if they are
in his or her way. The challenge was to identify the intended step even while
such out-of-context interactions are observed with informative interactions. The
proposed method estimates the progress of the cooking process from the history
of the interactions together with the intended next step. The estimated progress
narrows down the options for the next step. In the experiment, the proposed
method achieved more than 70 % accuracy in its forecast. Because forecasting
is generally a diﬃcult task of pattern recognition, this is a remarkable score,
nonetheless the accuracy should be enhanced by more sophisticated semantic
models with statistical information.

Conclusions
In this study, we introduced challenges for assisting with everyday cooking activ-
ities, particularly menu planning and food preparation. There are many com-
mercial websites that provide recipes. Accurate and easy-to-use recipe search
and recommendation tools are important to increase the number of customers.
We introduced challenges by cookpad as a practical example. An accurate and
large corpus is critical to achieve a practical recipe search engine. Companies
pay a lot of eﬀorts to maintain their corpus and keep the system up-to-date.
We also introduced academic challenges for menu planning. There is a lot
of room for academic researchers to enhance recipe recommendation. Food pref-
erences are inﬂuenced by the user’s day; therefore, a highly customized recipe
recommendation requires a daily context of the family members. From this per-
spective, both web mining and Life logging are within the scope of this applica-
tion.
While there have been several assistive systems and related methods for
food preparation, one of the most important challenges is to obtain a highly
informative semantic model of the food preparation process. We believe that
matching the recipe text and cooking observations will provide a breakthrough
in this topic. Finally, more challenges in non-Japanese languages are waited for
cross-cultural applications in everyday cooking.

Abstract. “A sense of qualia experience” provides an emotional quality by a
well-designed strategy to amuse the Target Audience (TA). Nowadays, the
fashion industry supplies its TA with high value-added experiences that include
a variety of sensitivity, touching, and qualia, into their daily lives. The purpose
of this research is to explore the exhibition design of fashion industry activity
applied by diﬀerentiation and specialization through ﬁve aspects of QUALIA,
including attractiveness, beauty, creativity, delicacy, and engineering, for future
references. Based on the analysis of the data research, the audience has shown
internalization of the culture and creativity through building an atmosphere,
storytelling, perceptual-space creating, and visual-experiences, shaping from
curatorial design of fashion show industry.
Keywords: Qualia · Fashion show · S-O-R model · Cultural creativity

Introduction
Creative Life Industry, which integrates experiences of livelihood industries and high
quality aesthetics, plays an important role in guiding enterprises to apply the concepts
of experience economy. There are various competitive elements that play signiﬁcant
roles within the economic development from industrial to experience-economy. These
include quality, function, brand, service, and information. Additionally, the key factors
that create the experience-economy are the “service space” and “qualia.” According to
Lin (2011), in order for the development of economy and culture to ﬂourish, “experi‐
ences” are applied to four dimensions which include space, service, product and promo‐
tion of an enterprise.
After integrating culture with “design creativity,” a form of “aesthetics economics”
was produced and transformed into a “design industry.” There are many components
that inﬂuence the design stages of brand-name fashion. These range from cultural
strengths, integration of unique creativity, and emphasis of QUALIA traits. For this
reason, the success of a product in the fashion market is closely related “QUALIA.” As
a result, Taiwan has begun to shift into a cultural and creative industry by creating their
own brands and QUALIA products. Fashion brand companies realized that product
success depended not only on its market and technology aspects, but also innovation in
service.

The features of QUALIA enables users to become subjective of all the qualities that
contribute to the product’s uniqueness. To explain, level of attraction, beauty, creativity,
and engineering are all features of QUALIA that trigger interaction within the mind.
Previous research mainly focused on applying QUALIA in the area of product design.
This study extends that perspective to exploring curatorial design of fashion activity and
proposes diﬀerentiation and specialization for future references.

The S-O-R Paradigm Perspective
Studies on how the environment aﬀects human behavior has its roots in Psychology. For
instance, Schacter (2011) argued that in order to understand the environment, perception
is necessary and deﬁned as the organization, identiﬁcation, and interpretation of sensory
information. Similarly, Goldstein (2009) states that all perception involves signals in
the nervous system, which in turn, results from physical or chemical stimulation of
sensory organs. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by
learning, memory, expectation, and attention (Gregory 1987; Bernstein 2010).
Atmospherics is a qualitative construct that encompasses four of the main senses,
with the exclusion of taste. In marketing terms, Philip Kotler (1973) deﬁnes “Atmos‐
pherics” as the conscious designing of space to create certain eﬀects in buyers. He also
argued “Atmospherics” as a tangible product and is only a small part of the total
consumption package. Buyers respond to the entire product, which include services,
warranties, packaging, advertising, pleasantries, images and so on.
Stimulus-response theory was the ﬁrst to suggest a link between environment and
behavior. In Marketing research, Kotler (1973) initially referred to the importance of
environmental atmospherics as a marketing tool. The Mehrabian-Russell Model is based
on the Stimulus-Organism-Response(S-O-R) paradigm, which includes components of
the environment (S) that induce approach-avoidance behaviors (R) within the environ‐
ment. They are mediated by the individual’s emotional states (O) aroused by the envi‐
ronment. Mehrabian and Russell (1974) states that responses to an environment are
classiﬁed as either approach or avoidance behaviors. Lazarus (1998) criticized this
behavioristic psychology perspective by arguing that “a person in this interchange is a
passive creature, reacting to an environment that stimulates him or her, and that person’s
inﬂuence on the environment is ignored.”
Commercial space is divided into three diﬀerent atmospheres: intended atmosphere,
designed space, and perceived atmosphere. Kotler presents atmospherics as an important
concept that largely inﬂuences position when determining value. Kotler proposes that
applying brand fashion show to connecting atmospheres will produce a causal chain:
• Eﬀect of perceived sensory qualities
• TA’s perception of the sensory qualities
• Impact of TA’s modiﬁed information and aﬀective state
• Sensory qualities of space surrounding object of purchase.

The Branded Service Space Perspective
Service space is a concept that was developed by Booms and Bitner (1981) to emphasize
the impact of the physical environment when a service process takes place. Booms &
Bitner deﬁned a servicescape as “the environment in which the service is assembled and
in which the seller and customer interact, combined with tangible commodities that
facilitate performance or communication of the service.” The servicescape divides into
the exterior (landscape, exterior design, signage, parking, surrounding environment) and
the interior (interior design and decor, equipment, signage, layout, air quality, temper‐
ature and ambiance). Bitner (1992) coined the term ‘servicescapes’ in reference to the
physical surroundings, as fashioned by service organizations, to facilitate the provision
of service oﬀerings to customers.
A brand encompasses the name, logo, image, and perceptions that identify a product,
service, or provider in the minds of customers. It takes shape in advertising, packaging,
and other marketing communications, and becomes a focus in the relationship with
consumers. Brand equity is deﬁned as the value of a brand. According to cognitive
psychology, brand equity lies in consumers’ awareness of brand features and associa‐
tions, which drive attributions and perceptions. Branded environments extend the expe‐
rience of an organization’s brand, or distinguishing characteristics as expressed in
names, symbols and designs, to the design of interior or exterior physical settings (Bertil
2011). It uses space as a physical embodiment of the brand to create a “brand space.”
This is achieved through “architecture, interiors, lighting, graphics, landscape” in spaces
such as retail stores, showrooms, trade-fair booths and oﬃce environments.
Servicescape comprised of ambient factors, design factors and social factors (Ezeh
and Harris 2007). Similarly, fashion show environmental stimuli are comprised of both
ambient and design factors. Creators of branded fashion show environments leverage
the eﬀect of the physical structure and organization of space to help deliver their TAs’
identity attributes, personality and key messages. In fashion shows, the catwalk serv‐
icescape involves exterior space (exterior design, signage, surrounding environment)
and interior space (interior design and decor, stage, equipment, signage, layout, air
quality, temperature and atmosphere). Various beneﬁts of a fashion branded environ‐
ment include improved brand position and communication, greater audience recogni‐
tion, diﬀerentiation from competitors, and higher perceived value. The concept of
fashion show servicescape and audience experiences help assess the diﬀerence between
a fashion brand and a fashion industry.

QUALIA Perspective
The former Chief Executive Oﬃcer of Sony Corporation, Nobuyuki Idei, believes that
market products and “QUALIA” are closely related. Qualia design is considered to be
one of the pivotal components in cultural and creative life industries. It has a signiﬁcant
impact on consumer perception of innovation. Until now, research investigating use the
QUALIA were more focused in the area of product design. According to the study
conducted by Ko et al. (2009); Lin (2011), examined a cultural product design model
QUALIA into the Fashion Show Case Analysis
195

that internalizes the awareness of culture and creativity through atmosphere building,
storytelling, perceptual-space creating, and touch-experience design. Based on the anal‐
ysis above, the conclusion is that the TA internalizes all these features and information
that are shaped from curatorial design of fashion industry and have an impact on their
experience and interpretation. Research on QUALIA design factors of the fashion exhi‐
bition environment display that QUALIA design provides a deep understanding of the
link between target audience behaviors and new ways of interpreting feature-responses.
To investigate the eﬀect of QUALIA empirically, it is necessary to analyze participants’
emotions and interactions within the fashion show. This article analyzes the psycho‐
logical processes that produce the various emotional expressions that occurred
throughout the fashion show of emotions references the emotional expressions produced
in the fashion show and analyzes the psychological processes.
4.1
Attractiveness Perspective
Visual attractiveness, produced primarily by visual stimuli, is a quality that produces a
strong desire. It generates emotions of interest and attracts attention to an object, event,
or process.
4.2
Beauty Perspective
Beauty is a quality that is visually pleasing. The experience of “beauty” often involves
an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and harmony with nature, which
may lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being. Because this can be a subject
experience, it is often said that “beauty” is in the eye of the beholder. For instance, in a
fashion show, visually stimulating experiences are created and inﬂuenced by sensational
clothing showpieces, external elements, fashion model, stage style, music levels, etc.
Therefore, the performance eﬀect and emotional expression embodies psychology and
consciousness.
4.3
Creativity Perspective
Creativity is a phenomenon in which something new and valuable is formed. Re-search
by Dr. Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at Manchester Busi‐
ness School has suggested that the creative proﬁle can be explained by four primary
creativity traits with narrow facets within each. “Idea Generation” (Fluency, Originality,
Incubation and Illumination). “Personality” (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity).
“Motivation” (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement). “Conﬁdence” (Producing, Sharing
and Implementing). Creativity in fashion shows involves performance strategy, theme,
media application and originality.

4.4
Delicacy Perspective
Exhibition layout and design oﬀer service and activity ﬂow. The importance of delicacy
perception and its inﬂuence can be seen in fashion shows. These factors consist of
atmosphere creation, visual performances, fashion show space imagery, runway type,
model type, clothing display techniques etc. We expect that the delicacy results can be
used as a reference for relevant fashion runway design in the future.
4.5
Engineering Perspective
Kansei Engineering aims at the development of products and services by translating the
customer’s psychological feelings and needs into the domain of product design (i.e.
parameters). Kansei Engineering parametrically links the customer’s emotional
responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a
product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the
intended feeling. Kansei Engineering can be considered as a methodology within the
research ﬁeld of ‘Aﬀective Engineering’. Aside from the functional traits, the visual
qualities engineering design may aﬀect perception.
Fashion shows incorporate aﬀective attributes such as brand attractiveness, style
aesthetics, performance creativity, service delicacy and space engineering which are key
factors consumers seek when selecting brand products. Therefore, fashion designs must
consider not only audience products needs but also need oﬀer qualia mentality and
emotions.

Method
This study presents review of fashion-show environmental psychology articles based
on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm. The paper follows the sequence of the
Stimulus-Organism-Response(S-O-R) framework starting with environmental stimuli
in fashion show settings. Then, audience’s inner organism theories are reviewed,
followed by behavioral responses. Fashion show target audience (TA) under the stim‐
ulus-response paradigm are viewed as machines which react automatically to stimuli.
Therefore, the S-O-R suggests that when a person is exposed to external stimuli, ‘inner
organism changes’ precede behavioral responses.
According to the S-O-R model, to investigate the eﬀect of QUALIA empirically, it
is necessary to analyze participants’ interactions and emotions produced within the
fashion show. The purpose of this research is to explore the exhibition design of fashion
industry activity and apply the ﬁve aspects of QUALIA: attractiveness, beauty, crea‐
tivity, delicacy, and engineering. Figure 1 describes the SOR model of QUALIA percep‐
tion and processing involved in brand-fashion exhibition. The research method consists
of three steps: sense environmental variables to understand participants emotional state
information, then behavioral responses to design elements, and ﬁnally to apply QUALIA
design into fashion show; and four stages: (1) Brand Showpieces design concept (trans‐
lating fashion features into curatorial information and design elements), (2) exhibition
set (project design, target, objective), (3) exhibition design (Strategy, theme, originality),

and (4) designing exhibition layout (activity ﬂow, environment visual). Therefore,
QUALIA are elements of discourse between a participant and a brand. The aim of this
paper is to review fashion exhibition environments, TA emotions, and cognition in
fashion show experiences.

conceptual framework for exploring the fashion show turning (S-O-R) into QUALIA.
The Stimulus-Organism-Response(S-O-R) paradigm dominated consumer behavior
literature and has been widely employed in marketing. In recent years, the rapid devel‐
opment of Taiwan’s creativity in the living industry began to promote service innova‐
tion; which also became a core competitive strength for the fashion industry. In order
to match the requirements of innovative service, the process of QUALIA design has not
only been introduced to the industry, but also created total experiences for the audiences
and consumers.

Experimental Samples
This study is from the brand curatorial design of fashion show pragmatic experience and
formality. Fashion brands trace back to the essence of new creative design concepts,
showpieces, and curatorial works. Interpretations can be aﬀected by attractiveness, rela‐
tionship between brand, curatorial, operation of an art space, etc. In other words, the
direction of curatorial and adjustments result from diﬀerent experiences.
In this study, the experimental samples were based on the brand curatorial design of
fashion shows. KERAIA not only oﬀers combinations of ordinary clothing and party
dresses, but also makes high-end fashion apparels and formal outﬁts. Following the
international trend, they also launched brand-fashion shows to promote various seasonal
198
S.H. Huang et al.

products such as accessories, fashion leather products, shoes, hand-bags, and jewels.
Given the research purposes, KERAIA’s fashion show events over the past two years
were observed.
Experimental Sample 1: Brand Fashion Show in Taipei IN Style (2014). Taipei IN
Style’s (TIS) core value is to promote the fashion industry in Taiwan by supporting not
only the popular brands, but also the individual designers for their creativities and aspira‐
tions. KERAIA attended the new collection fashion show in TIS with the clear goal of
introducing Taiwan fashion with the professionals worldwide. TIS strives to pull an all-in-
one trade fair where a variety of events, ranging from press conferences, house shows,
seminars, trunk shows, and business matching meetings, are all delicately presented for the
numerous visitors. Table 1 is KERAIA curatorial design of fashion show with 2014 new
collection- British Luxury beauty. Ms. Tsai Li-Yu, design director, chose to adhere to the
new artistic aesthetics fusion. The Brand curatorial design of fashion show was a process
consisting of showpieces design concept while setting the British Sweet and romantic theme
as the visual environment. Plan atmosphere and show space imagery. The purpose is to
promote Taiwan’s designer brand. Target is especially for brand exposure for the interna‐
tional fashion media, business partners, and brand VIPs.
Table 1. KERAIA curatorial design of fashion show in Taipei IN Style, 2014
TIS is a platform for Asian brands that also acts as a bridge connecting KERAIA
with buyers. This is beneﬁcial for both parties as they provide opportunities to meet,
exchange of ideas, business discussions, and introduction of new potential friends from
diﬀerent parts of the world. Table 2 displays the types of QUALIA elements and Partic‐
ipant emotion deﬁnitions involved in the KERAIA fashion show. In relation to the
performance eﬀect, the artistic taste and emotion expression presented in the fashion
show can stimulate the audience psychologically. In addition to media exposure and
previously listed beneﬁts, TIS also oﬀers KERAIA VIPs the most up-to-date fashion
and market trends, new product launchings, and special promotions through the TIS

Experimental Sample 2: Brand Fashion Show in Mandarin Oriental, Taipei (2015).
QUALIA branded environments consist of improved brand position and communica‐
tion. KERAIA demonstrates this in their 20th anniversary brand festival by becoming
renowned for providing “great customer service” to repay VIPs. The fashion show’s
high quality brand servicescape includes many features such as catwalk show venue,
exterior space (exterior design, signage, surrounding environment) and interior space
(interior design, decor, stage layout, air quality, temperature and atmosphere). Table 3
is KERAIA’s curatorial design of fashion show in 2015, involving a new collection in
a British Modern Chic style fashion. The process is comprised of showpieces design
concepts, elegant vogue and low-key luxury, along with a British chic visual setting.
Plan modern atmosphere and show space imagery. The purpose is to promote brand
image. Brand curatorial fashion show target is especially for brand exposure to the local
fashion media and fashion celebrities.

delicacy, and space engineering. All of which are key factors that consumers seek when
selecting brand name products. Customer relationship management, building brand
image while maintaining VIPs feelings, is also very essential in becoming established
among customers.

Conclusion
This article is to understand the process of how the “QUALIA” concept is formed in
audience’s minds and how they estimate this “QUALIA”. Research is also trying to
build a framework for the target audiences to calculate the qualia level of fashion show
experience and services through S-O-R model literature review. These factors can also
inﬂuence the comprehension of S-O-R model by participants and curators. Furthermore,
we conclude this study of applying QUALIA in curatorial design in fashion shows.
1. For the audiences qualia perception and experiences:Creative Life Industry integrates
experiences and quality aesthetics. The quality of the fashion show may be perceived
as higher quality based on the environment in which the service is provided. An impor‐
tant role in guiding the fashion industry is to apply the concepts of the experience
economy. In the fashion industry, curatorial design of the catwalk show should be
expanded into a product that applies QUALIA into the designing experiences process
such as Atmosphere building(topic attraction, design style, brand image, brand
Equity), Sense-experiences (clothing style, exhibits design sense, sensory emotion,
aesthetic appearance), Pleasant emotions (novelty, interesting, surprise, pleasure, sense
of innovation), Practical functions (show service details, event space arrangement,
external event planning, media exchanges PR), and Servicescape (field engineering
experience, create an atmosphere of tonality, external environment planning). QUALIA
in the fashion show relates to the performance effect in which the emotion expression
embodies psychology and the consciousness.
2. For the Market-Industry functional responses:Based on the analysis above, the
conclusion is that the TA is capable of internalizing the culture and creativity through
building an atmosphere, storytelling, perceptual-space creating, or visual-experi‐
ences shaping from curatorial designs of fashion industry. In the fashion show
emotion expression relates the performance eﬀected, the emotion expression can
embodies psychology and consciousness. According to this perspective, this study
extends the view to explore the exhibition design of fashion industry activity by
applying fashion art aesthetics, commercial functions, and the promotion of diﬀer‐
entiation and specialization through the ﬁve aspects of QUALIA: attractiveness,
beauty, creativity, delicacy, and engineering. This conclusion can serve as a refer‐
ence for future interests in applying QUALIA to enhance industrial competitiveness.
This article demonstrates an established QUALIA curatorial fashion show model and
can be utilized as a valuable reference when designing a cultural creative experience.
With the development of industrial tendencies, fashion industry companies gradually
realize that the keys to product innovation are not solely depend on market and tech‐
nology aspects, but should also improve service innovation. Fashion brands are more

focused on adapting with consumers by discovering ways to create new experiences and
establish value. The KERAIA QUALIA fashion exhibition contributed a deep under‐
standing regarding the link between target audience behaviors and new methods of
interpreting speciﬁc features responses in the fashion show exhibition.

Abstract. Under the standard of mass production, how to apply different ele-
ments to the apparel in customized space is an issue concerned by the designer.
The energy from the artist is inexhaustible. If it can be extended to apply to the
apparel, such policy selection shall create the demand of customers. The purpose
of this study is to evaluate and compare the effect of the transition design of
artwork to the purchasing demand of the customers. There were thirteen
apparels chosen and divided into three groups. Except for the art group, which
was the test group for the artwork conversion, pop group and memorial group
were selected for comparison. From the result of the study, we found that the
elements coming from the artwork and converted the design on to the T-shirt
having higher demand evaluation in “Artistic atmosphere”, “cultural connota-
tion”, and “special design”. The conclusion was that art group implied more
proportion in the demand factor of “souvenir”. In contrast, the basic demand
factors such as “ﬁgure modiﬁcation” and “product price” obtained lower eval-
uation levels. At last, this study offers four proposals including price-oriented
mode of production, functional fabrics material value added, joint brand mar-
keting planning and cross-border cooperation in apparel design, and wishes to
popularize the art of living through apparel.

Introduction
Transferring the poetry with cultural thickness into artistic painting to reﬂect poetic
feeling to people is the artistic conception through “painting” illustrated by artists who
construct creative mode to transmit the situational poetry (Lin and Lin 2015). Such
creative concept is that the artists, after passing inner transformation, perform the
external form of aesthetics on the work. They use the characters codes of the poetry as a
bridge to shorten the communication distance between the painters and the viewers. In
addition, it contains the depth of the cultural creativeness. If it is transferred into art
products, it must have development value with commercial mode. However, the artists
take full-time in personal creation and usually they have insufﬁcient knowledge in
experiencing the art products and market transactions. The common way they use

usually is selling to the customers through gallery or the manager. Therefore, they do
not consider concretely how to commercialize the art commodities. And the application
of the cultural creativeness is limited to traditional souvenir only (Lin et al. 2016).
Hsieh and Guan (2011) had taken the artists’ works as the subjects and proposed
the design mode to transorm the artistic products. Thus, taking the artwork as a media
to design the artistic products was becoming a trend of cross-boundary cooperation
between the art and the design. By the value exchange between them, the market of
artistic products was created. In addition, the reading people could collect artistic
products which were more affordable than the original works after enjoying the
exhibition of paintings. Thus, it could provide another incoming source for the artists to
extend the creation of life.
At present, historical relics from museum or with local characteristic such as
aboriginal culture or Hakka culture always become the major research and design
objects for the cultural products of apparel. Also, there were observations and dis-
cussion (Lu 2011) for the type of apparel design which used the elements of character
art and aesthetic feeling. It is seldom to use the mass-production of apparel, through the
carrier of conversion work of art, as related study spindle. The purpose of this study, by
discussing the art transition design applied in mass-production apparel, is to know if
there is any inﬂuence of the transition design of artwork to the purchasing demand, to
expect the artistic life having broader commodity options and make people dress &
walk with good feeling of art.

Literature Review
2.1
Way of Artwork Transition Design
Henrik and Vanessa (2008) thought the artwork was not created for functionality, but
expressed the human experiences and was ingenious creative work. If the painting was
printed on T-shirt or the furniture was designed with artistic sense, then the art would
be a kind of integrated product. Therefore, the combination of art and apparel would
not damage the appreciation value of the artwork existed alone. Clever conversion and
combination could make product and artwork have synergistic effect. On way the
artistic aesthetics can be extended to the general public by using the propagation force
commodity economy; the other way the product can continue to be innovated through
the art. Then the demands of different consumer groups will be satisﬁed.
Artwork belongs to cultural assets. By utilizing the cultural features and charac-
terization, the artwork could be regarded as the elements for product design. It could
promote self-recognition and personalized consumer experience, which was the way
(Yair et al. 2001) to highlight local culture under globalization market competition. Hsu
and Lin (2014) used the multivariate ethnic and cultural characteristics in Taiwan as the
source of creativeness and concept for development. Through the literature review and
expert opinion, collecting scenario approach and product semantics, cultural product
design program was proposed. Such program constructed three cultural spaces and
levels; the factors to be considered in product design were separated as the design
properties. These properties are: (1) External or physical level: including color, texture,
206
C.-Y. Hung and C.-L. Chen

lines and shape, surface ornamentation, process of details, and components composi-
tion; (2) Middle or behavior level: including easy for use, structure, operability of
binding relationship, security and functionality; (3) Internal or psychological level:
including the special meaning, story and feeling, or cultural characteristics of product,
and so on. Such program is the cross-referencing among cultural space, cultural level
and cultural products; and it can be referred when cultural products are designed.
For the purpose of applying to the articles in modern life, Yeh (2014) discussed the
cultural connotation of traditional and classical poetry. With the emotional demand of
modern design and the angle of experiencing the beauty of poetry, she designed and
built “the mode of transition design for poetry shape”. Such mode used the discussion
of related conception and variations in classical poetry culture to carry out the creative
conversion for industry application; and built a bridge foundation for oriental culture
and arts and product design. Apparel is just like canvas. The designers can use the
platform to express various elements on apparel. By means of the important theory and
basis of design conversion, how to execute and practice is the aim of this study.
2.2
Purchasing Demand of Souvenirs
The artwork itself was provided with appreciation value; besides, it had implied value
of souvenir when it was transformed into consumer products. Gordon (1986) thought
that souvenir was “admission or the admission for getting into the memory”. It has the
same function as buying the apparel which printed with artwork. For most of the people
liked to recall special time or event of the memory, the souvenir had the reminded effect
to express the same feeling or resonate. Littrell et al. (1993) had proposed 8 phases to
investigate the truth cognitive research of crafts souvenirs for the tourists. They were
(1) uniqueness and originality, (2) manufacturing method, (3) aesthetic sense,
(4) functionality and usability, (5) meeting the cultural and historical meaning,
(6) manufacturer and material, (7) personal shopping experience, and (8) credibility.
The criteria of these phases had considerable relevance with the purchasing intention
assessed by the customer. The apparel with artwork transition design had the monu-
mental value. If the same assessment index was used, the signiﬁcance found by this
study might be inﬂuenced in certain degree.
2.3
Purchasing Demand of Apparel Design
The difference between the apparel and the clothes with high quality was that the latter
was the clothes for one person or few people customized by a tailor. It valued ﬁtness
and particularity. However, the apparel (ready-to-wear, apparel, ready-made garments)
was done quickly and pre-ﬁnished sewing or “Apparel which is done before sold”
(Hsiao 1988). Apparel was one of the representatives of the popular products; and
popularized by industrial mass production. It would change the design pattern by
following different social culture and economic environment and fashion trends.
Nowadays, apparel becomes indispensable necessities in daily life.
The Effect of the Transition Design of Artwork
207

Le (1997) thought the following factors might inﬂuence the quality of apparel,
cognitive or impression of the value: epidemic, design details, performance means,
main ingredient material, accessories material, structure, work, ease, logos, brand
image, after-sales service and so on. On the above factors, brand and after-sales are the
business areas of marketing planning. The others are important factors considered in
the phase of design and manufacturing. (Chen and Chen 2011) had researched for the
demand effect assessment of customers of apparel design. They listed 23 items of
demands for assessment from three phases, design expression, sewing work and
consumer behavior by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to calculate the weight.
The result showed that the top ﬁve evaluated demands, the most important factors for
customers, were “design taste and aesthetic sense”, “able to modify ﬁgure defect”,
“applicability of commodity”, “commodity price”, and “combination offer of com-
modity” sequentially. For the apparel designers or marketing planning staff, such result
offered the reference and basis in evaluating the customer demand factors.

Research Methods
To evaluate the purchase demand of the customer for the apparel after conversed the
design with artwork and to further understand the difference between the original and
the product without design conversed by artwork, we used the three layers of cultural
product design proposed by Hsu and Lin (2011) and the top ﬁve factors for apparel
demand proposed by Chen (2011) plus eight demand elements in souvenirs, the
research framework of costume design conversion was integrated and displayed as
shown in Fig. 1. Test and comparison research was executed to observe the inﬂuence
of purchase demand of the customers.

Sample Selection
The range of apparel was complicated and multivariate in many ﬁelds such as gender,
function, material, category, pattern, age and application. In order to focus on the
research of design conversion, we planned to use single item of upper outer garment
which was less obvious and highlights design style. In addition, to avoid the inter-
ference from style and level of apparel and the pattern and decorative accessories,
T-shirt was selected as the sample of this research. Such type of commodity had the
features of easy structure and not signiﬁcant gender in wearing. Most important factor
was that it could be easy to mass production and meets the objects and scopes dis-
cussed by this research.

The Effect of the Transition Design of Artwork
209

This research selected 13 garments as shown in Table 1, divided into three groups.
Each group was composed of 4 garments. Except that the art group was transition
design of artwork; pop group and souvenirs group were selected for comparison. The
commodities of artwork transition design contained four artworks of international
famous
artists:
(A)
PIET
MONDRIAN,
(B)
JEAN-MICHEL
BASQUIAT,
(C) ANDY WARHOL and (D) PAULA SCHER. And commodities manufactured for
that season and designed by general costume designer were selected for the pop
group. In which, plain garment without ﬁgure or pattern was put into the pop
group. Besides, T-shirt which had characteristics of intersection between art group and
pop group, often seen in museums or tourist site, was chosen as the comparison
group. The 13th garment, maternity dress, was selected for individual comparison due
to the special purpose. All of the samples for such research were in mass-production;
and they were the commodities which were public in physical store or virtual online
store. Because the samples were consuming commodities, so the price would be an
important index for further observation. Therefore the prices for these three groups of
commodities would be displayed on the samples of the research. The principle of
marked price was based on the mean value of market price for each group; consistent
price would be made. If promotions or other combination offered caused the price
ﬂuctuations, it was beyond the range that this research could control.
3.2
Questionnaire Design and Testee
The questionnaire contained basic information, description and test questions with the
ﬁgure of commodities. It was scored by ﬁve rating scales. The testees evaluated sub-
jectively the ﬁtting degree of the eight purchasing demands according to thirteen
images of garments; one score for Strongly Disagree; ﬁve scores for Strongly Agree.
Choose three types of commodities that the testees wanted to buy most in sequence. In
this research, the testees were divided into two parts: (1) there were 18 experts in
design ﬁeld and web questionnaire was chosen; (2) there were 57 general students from
college who ﬁnished the questionnaire in the classroom in school. First the testees
would be informed about the purpose of the questionnaire. The images and description
of the commodities with price marked would be displayed by brief report. Later, the
students should ﬁll the questionnaire to evaluate the eight assessment attributes of the
commodities. The valid questionnaires included 74, in which 23 for males and 51 for
females.

Results and Discussion
Table 2 listed the mean value, between 2.91 and 3.52, for eight demand assessment for
the whole testees. The mean value was 3.20. The standard deviation for all items was
smaller than 1, which meaned the opinion of the testees under such structure was
consistent.

4.1
Comparison for the Demand Items in Purchasing Apparel
Figure 2 was drawn by using different line sections for comparison according to the
related information from Table 3. The difference among three groups was made
through the analysis and comparison. From Fig. 2, it was obviously that except the
item of “wear and use it frequently” had closer differences, the remaining items had
signiﬁcant differences. Table 3 listed relevant information of comparing apparel cate-
gories with three different design conversions, brieﬂy introduced below:
1. The mean value for artistic atmosphere for art group was 3.53. It met that artwork,
after converted to apply in apparel design, still kept the advantage of art vision. The
second was 3.33 (memorial group) and the last was 2.99 (pop group). From here,
we found that the reputation of the artist and the artwork with expensive price
converted on T-shirt deﬁnitely could establish the vision of art appreciation for the
customers. If cross-matching for “artistic atmosphere” and “price” with these three
groups, the order of “price acceptance” for them would be pop group (3.96),
memorial group (3.02) and art group (2.12) sequentially. The interesting thing was
that the testee generally did not agree with T-shirt with high price. Though “artistic
atmosphere” for art group obtained high rating, yet the high price of the artwork
would not reﬂect on the price of the apparel equally. It also explained the customers
understood the price of T-shirt. No big difference occurred due to the converted
design with artwork or other ﬁgure. From the view point of complete competition

market, no matter website online shopping or purchasing via traditional channel, the
design value of the T-shirt added by brand business would be never stopped. High
quality with low price became the normality of the market. Therefore, under the
multi-choice of the customer, the high acceptance of price of the pop group was the
inevitable result in competition.

2. If viewing the point of “design is tasteful”, the mean value for “Art group” (3.32)
equaled to the “Memorial group” (3.33), which was higher than the “Pop group”
(3.11). The deﬁnition of design taste might be changed due to trend or preference of
customers and it was subjective assessment. From the evaluation in terms of scores,
the “Art group” expressed personal style of the artist; the “Memorial group” must ﬁt
the subject of tourism or sightseeing. Topics for both groups might have consis-
tency. If the material of the design came from artwork or landscape feature, the
reputation of the material might inﬂuence the judge of the testee on the design taste.
That the evaluation for both groups would be the same and be higher than the “Pop
group”.
3. If viewing the point of “cultural connotation”, the mean value for three groups
would be “Memorial group” (3.70), “Art group” (3.44) and “Pop group” (3.07) in
sequence. If classiﬁed by commodity function, the products of memorial group had
the concept of souvenir. The design idea was based on landscape feature which was
used to express the local culture or popular culture to satisfy the request of the
customer. However, art group expressed the unique style of the artist. It implied
cultural and historical background. It was an age of painting, also is the model of
art. The cultural thickness is undoubtedly. Therefore the evaluation for memorial
group and art group would be higher.
4. If viewing the point of “increase aesthetic sense”, the mean value for “Pop group”
(3.10) was higher than “Art group” (3.02) and “Memorial group” (2.95). The
biggest function of the apparel was to let the people have characteristics such as
young, vivid, thin, handsome, beautiful, and so on. They were important factors of
apparel that people chose to purchase. Therefore, the products of pop group would
ingratiate the market demand. To the supplier of apparel, the proportion for
“wearing to increase aesthetic feeling” must be higher than other groups. In addi-
tion, due to the limitation of material in design, the evaluation of aesthetic feeling
for the memorial group was low.
5. If viewing the point of “wear and use it frequently”, the mean value for three groups
would be “Pop group” (3.11), “Art group” (2.90) and “Memorial group” (2.75) in
sequence. Sample selected in this research was the single product of T-Shirt. The
style of such product was simple structured without big change. It would be suitable
for artwork or other totem printed on it. Hence, on the market, many museums and
tourist places would make T-shirt as the souvenir. As a result, it had high memorial
nature but not be put on frequently. So the evaluation for Art group and Memorial
group was the lowest. Apparel popular in season must accept the high test in the
market and focus on the demands of the customer in changing and innovating.
Thus, it would focus on applicability requirements.

Comparison for the Commodities that You Most Want to Purchase
From thirteen products, selected three of products based on purchasing intention. After
classiﬁed and added up, they could be distributed and shown as Table 4. Overall,
F(15.3 %), D(14.0 %), I(10.8 %) and J(10.8 %) were the ones that people would like

to purchase. If classiﬁed by gender, D(16.9 %), I(20.0 %) and L(10.8 %) were the ones
that men wanted; F(17.9 %), D(12.8 %) and J(12.8 %) were the ones that women
wanted. The only one that men and women liked was D. The product design of
PAULA SCHER was conversed by painter and art educator. The sequence for these
three commodities counted in accordance with purchase intention would be art group,
memorial group and pop group. The most popular commodity was F(15.3 %) for the
pop group of Disney product. The least popular commodity was K(1.8 %) for the
memorial group of auspicious product released by Imperial Palaces of the Ming and
Qing Dynasties in Beijing. Both were designed with traditional totem. It could be
inferred that the design of F style tends to be cute and lovable, with famous ﬁgure on
the product of T-shirt. Additionally, it was relevant that the majority of testees were
female.

Conclusions and Suggestions
In recent years, inﬂuenced by large and international apparel chain brand set such as
ZARA, H&M, UNIQLO, GAP, and the competition of low-priced apparel from China,
the apparel industry in Taiwan was facing the severe test. Observing from the con-
sumer’s point of view, if people could have high-quality and diversity of choice, then
such challenge would be healthy competition for promoting the customer’s value. The
purpose of this research, by using the direction of multi-material, expected to create
customer’s demand and discussed the demand assessment inﬂuence of the customer
due to the apparel with design conversed with artwork. The research structure basis was
made according to the literature document; then built the customer assessment index to

apparel commodities with different design and materials. The purpose of this research
shall be analyzed and conﬁrmed via questionnaire.
The result showed that the element coming from the artwork was converted as a
design in T-shirt. The demand assessment for “I think it has artistic atmosphere”, “I
think it has cultural connotation”, and “I think the design is special” was higher. It
could be inferred that such kind of commodity implied proportion of “souvenir” with
more demand factors. But, the level of demand assessment for the basic apparel of
“Wearing can modify the ﬁgure” and “ I can accept the price” was lower. Therefore in
addition to satisfying the economies scale and price problem in manufacturing, the
design plan was more important if we wanted to make artistic life popularly via
apparel. Below listed some observations and proposals:
1. Price-oriented mode of production: Though machines were helpful for manufac-
turing apparel, yet the sewing work still could not replace human processing. So,
labor-intensive still could not be broken away. To effectively reduce the cost and the
selling price, in the ﬁeld of apparel technology, the manufacturing of T-shirt was
easy and suitable for mass-production. Due to less change in style, the transferred
printing for applying the artwork design on the apparel played the key role.
Combining modern technology, the printing technique expressed the art of the
culture and the beauty of the apparel. As said by Lin (2014), it reﬂected “consid-
ering the tradition and ancient time; transferring into modern elegance”.
2. Functional fabrics material value added: For the style change in T-Shirt is less, it
might be better if value can be added onto the material of the cloth and embraced
with artwork topic. For example, artwork with environmental awareness could
match with yarn recycled from styrofoam. Artwork with natural water and mountain
could join with cool feeling yarn or warm yarn. Even the apparel series with pure
cotton also could be made by using organic cotton. Under the policy of value added
but price not increased, the purchasing intention for people would be increased.
3. Joint brand marketing planning: The brand factor was excluded in this research for
everyone knew it would inﬂuence the purchase intention in various ﬁelds of
commodities. The cooperation of apparel brand and the artist was just like the
combination of culture and the industry. At present, the international famous brand,
e.g., Uniquo, had similar commodity plan and that was worthy to learn
4. Cross-border cooperation in apparel design: Trend of fashion and the textile tech-
nology were the important factors to be referred in apparel design plan. But the
cooperation of artwork and the artist was few. If art and culture could be integrated
into the apparel industry, such kind of apparel business might become one of new
creative industries due to the art authorized.
If apparel, just like canvas, can make artist enjoy playing, and beautiful patterns or
harmonious colors can be expressed while people wear and move, then the target of
artistic life or life art can be spread through the perfect combination of apparel with
high usage and exposure. This is the largest motivation of this study. The age of
making quantity instead of quality in the market of apparel in Taiwan had gone for a
long time. If brand business is fabulous to many SMEs, then original intention of
exploring customer needs shall be the unchanged strategy.

Abstract. Japan is accepting a number of foreign visitors in the trend of cultural
diversity and building mutual understanding with who have diﬀerent cultural
background becomes essential. To support foreigner’s better quality of living, we
propose internet radio “CCR (Cross-Cultural Radio)”, which provides place
oriented contents including international listener’s comments. Sequentially,
“CCUS (Cross-Cultural Understanding Scale)” was invented and evaluation
experiment was conducted in Tokyo to measure the eﬀectiveness of CCR. Experi‐
ment result illustrates that CCR is eﬀective in certain dimensions of cross-cultural
understandings. This paper intends to explore the cultural exchange amongst
foreign visitors to Japan by the behavioral analysis of individual experiment
participants.

Introduction
General knowledge of the host culture such as language or values and attitude toward
the host culture and its members has been consistently posited to play an important role
in inﬂuencing eﬀective communication across cultures [1]. Although historically it has
been regarded as mono-lingual/cultural country, with a drastic increase of foreign visi‐
tors [2], Japan is no exception to appreciate cultural diversity. We have to be aware that
all foreigners are unique individuals, and we should not generalize them by nationality,
race, and religion. Foreigners are visiting Japan for several purposes such as sightseeing,
studying abroad or working. Likewise, depending on their cultural backgrounds, prob‐
lems they encounter greatly vary, and there will never be a solution applicable for
everyone. To propose a way to solve their problems individually, creating new media
to provide foreigners opportunities to know Japanese culture at a deeper level is mean‐
ingful from a cross-cultural viewpoint.
Previous literatures have shown in terms of tourists revisiting places, the eﬀect of
motivation and satisfaction is prominent according to Yoon [3] and Bramwell [4]. Alegre
[5] and Ekinci et al. [6] also pointed out the eagerness of tourists’ visiting in relation to
the characteristics of places. In terms of information system, Masuda [7] and Takagi [8]
suggested a recommendation system for tourists, which provides customized tour infor‐
mation depending on user’s need, including using smartphone applications. However,

there is almost no research of using internet radio speciﬁcally as a tool for building cross-
cultural understandings in Japan. In this paper, we propose place-oriented internet radio
called “CCR (Cross-Cultural Radio)”, which helps foreigners to recognize Japan from
a cross-cultural perspective by providing several types of place oriented contents,
including local people’s interview, international listener’s impression, opinion and
comments. In addition, we created original criteria “CCUS (Cross-Cultural Under‐
standing Scale)” and conducted an evaluation experiment in Tokyo to measure the actual
eﬀectiveness of contents and CCR. The crucial aim of this paper is to analyze the cultural
exchange amongst individual experiment participants through the observation of their
behaviors.

Design of Cross-Cultural Radio
2.1
Concept
CCR works in three steps (Fig. 1): contents design by the personality, listening process
by various listeners such as international tourists, studying abroad students and multi‐
national corporations employees who are not familiar with Japanese culture, and getting
feedback plus revision of the contents. There are three types of contents available for
international listeners, which are “Guidebook” (audio information from famous guide‐
book such as Lonely Planet), “Locals” (story or tips from local people’s interview), and
“Tourists” (opinions including self reﬂection or sympathy to the other tourists who
listened to the previous two types of contents). In this paper we explicitly focused on
ﬁrst two aspects of the cycle, listening process by international tourists through evalu‐
ation experiment, followed by the contents design of Guidebook, Locals and Tourists.

2.2
System
Previous research [9–12] show that acceptable duration of contents should be around 1
minute to 1 and half minutes. Several companies deal with production of audio guide
player support the architecture of contents too.
1. Selecting Location. As CCR is designed for internationals visit Japan, the selection
of place where contents are mapped is undoubtedly important. In this research,
Asakusa, one of the most famous and popular tourist spots in Tokyo was chosen.
The reason is that Asakusa has rich cultural heritages such as Japanese traditional
temples or shrines, as well as dining venues and souvenir shops that attract many
international tourists. Besides Asakusa is located in the heart of Tokyo and has great
accessibility, which enables us to conduct ﬁeldwork eﬀortlessly.
2. Contents “Guidebook”. For contents Guidebook, several tips of accommodations,
introduction of restaurants and explanation of famous architecture were picked from
Lonely Planet Tokyo [13] and recorded using voice synthesize software (Fig. 2).
“Asakusa Engei-hall”
Have you ever seen standup comedy in your country? If you want to experience 
Japanese traditional comedy performance, here is the place. This is called Asakusa 
Engei-hall, provides humorous talking by classic rakugo speakers. The audience 
also enjoys stage arts unique to the theater, including the paper cutout and funny 
music played by carpenters tool.
Fig. 2. Example of contents “Guidebook”
3. Contents “Locals”. For contents Locals, a couple of interviews for locals were
conducted in Japanese and story related to their daily lives in Asakusa was selected.
Each story was translated into English and supplementary explanation about cultural
activity was added if needed (Fig. 3).
“Future of Asakusa”
(After the local’s interview in Japanese) Before World War II, Asakusa has been 
one of the most energetic, cutting edge cities in Japan. But unfortunately nowadays 
it’s taken over by other big cities like Roppongi or Shinjuku. She feels to revitalize 
Asakusa as a vivid city, collaboration with local community is important, not only 
bringing lots of tourists from outside. Using social networking service can be one 
of them; so young generation helps older shop owners to introduce these up-to-date
technologies into traditional Japanese shops.
Fig. 3. Example of contents “Locals”
4. Contents “Tourists”. Design of contents Tourists is slightly diﬀerent from the other
two contents. After the listeners listened to either contents Guidebook or Locals,
they had free discussion about comparison with their own culture. Listener‘s
The Behavioral Analysis for Cross-Cultural Understandings
219

conversation is recorded and certain parts including their opinion or impression of
the place are selected, then added to the previous two types of contents (Fig. 4).
Therefore, this type of contents encloses the real voice of listeners, both spoken in
English or Japanese (in this case the conversation is roughly translated into English).
“Asakusa’s current problem”
(After the local’s interview about subsidy for Asakusa dwellers in Japanese) “I was 
talking like, ‘This place is very packed’ and my friend said ‘No no what’s happen-
ing is actually quite opposite.’ and I asked ‘Really? Why?’ and he said ‘Because 
there is not enough young people to take on the jobs to kind of keep infrastructure 
that country going.’ And I didn’t even know that was an issue. As for in Britain, I 
really don’t know. I hear occasionally people talks about how they are worried 
like, as they are getting older there is gonna be more people on pensions and 
such…”
Fig. 4. Example of contents “Tourists”
5. Mapping Contents into CCR. Once place oriented contents are prepared, they are
mapped into CCR website (http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ayk/ccr/map.php, see also the
QR code in Fig. 5) using JavaScript and are available for smartphones or tablets.
Each contents are connected into one speech icon relevant to the place and when
users click or tap the icon corresponded contents are played.

Measurement Cross-Cultural Understanding Scale “CCUS”
To validate the credibility of CCR, evaluation process with appropriate criteria is essen‐
tial. Since CCR has a unique concept, inventing new and suitable measurement is more
realistic rather than using conventional criteria without localization. Measurement
design and cross-cultural adjustment are demonstrated by Benson [14], Cui & Awa [15]
and Yellen [16]. In the reference of related literature, Ito [17] determined ten dimensions
of cross-cultural understandings, which are:
1. Mobility. An individual’s ability to ﬁnd his/her way around in the foreign place is
one of the most important dimensions of cross-cultural understandings. Knowing
local geography and usage of public transportation systems are two potential items
for this dimension. Capability to ask staﬀ around in the face of uncertainty for
directions, or usage of appropriate tools such as map application on smartphone is
included. When mobility is improved, an individual feels more conﬁdent to explore
new places and shows an enthusiasm to ﬁnd cultural aspects in unfamiliar venues.
2. Food/Diet. Although food allergy is not the case, this dimension involves being
open-minded to try new food, and how he/she can be adaptable for the change of
diet. Accepting foreign food and culinary manners cannot be omitted when under‐
standing certain culture, as for many people eating food is an entrance of cultural
exchange. In relation to CCR contents, information such as recommendation of
restaurants or grocery stores might aﬀect this dimension, and ideally an individual
would represent an appetite for certain food, connected to either his/her own or host
culture.
3. Flexibility. As Hofstede deﬁned “uncertainty avoidance” in his prominent work
[18], more or less people from any cultural background may face culture shock and
attempt to escape from that anxiety. Being ﬂexible and patient for such uncertain
activity or unexpected cultural norm is one dimension. Listening to local people’s
story which is exotic to his/her own culture or having an interaction with them will
cultivate a tolerance of general matters and help them to hold positive image for
foreign culture.
4. Knowledge. Whether he/she accepts it or not, acknowledgment of host culture is
an essential aspect of cross-cultural understandings. In terms of socially appropriate
behaviors, host country nationals have certain expectations as to how foreigners in
their country should behave includes avoiding oﬀensive actions toward locals.
Webb et al.’s unobtrusive measure [19] could be useful in this regard, including
the shared notion of “common sense”. Compared to other dimensions, cultural
knowledge is visible and recognizable information, which is easily gained by
contents Guidebook.
5. Language Skills. This dimension appears consistently as a core factor of mutual
understandings as former literatures are reviewed. However we should be aware
that when cultural adaptation or acculturation occurs, adapted individual will learn
the language, but individual who learn the language may or may not adapt. It is
worth clarifying that this dimension is not about calculating an individual’s
language proﬁciency like speaking or listening, but it is rather about how open
The Behavioral Analysis for Cross-Cultural Understandings
221

he/she is to learn host language regardless of the level. For instance, in Japan visitors
only use English manage to survive but whoever tries to learn Japanese will make
life easier.
6. Interaction. The nature and frequency of interactions with host country individuals
is an indication of cross-cultural understandings. This involves one’s ability to
initiate interaction, as well as the extent of his/her eagerness to communicate to
Japanese people, regardless of language ability. This dimension is closely
connected to mobility, because when individuals feel comfortable to start interac‐
tion with locals (mainly conversational greetings such as “Excuse me” or “Thank
you”) their mobility will surely be enhanced.
7. Awareness of Cultural Diﬀerence. A question such as “to what extent are you aware
of Japanese culture/society is diﬀerent from yours?” is asked in this dimension.
Recognition of cultural diﬀerence between their own is a starting point to build
mutual understandings in any circumstances. The bigger the diﬀerence becomes
the more obvious of the awareness, and an individual with an experience of trav‐
eling to foreign countries tend to improve this dimension. However, not only
diﬀerence between the home culture but also similarities can contribute to its
change.
8. Nonverbal Communication. In addition to one’s language, there are a variety of
ways to communicate nonverbally. Understanding letters or characters, visible
gestures such as eye contact, and appreciating personal space are some of them.
Also having a reasonable repertoire of “communicative currency” may be useful.
As an example, in a communicative setting Japanese use euphemism often. For
foreign individuals sometimes it is hard to “read between the lines”, but at least
demonstrating an attitude to accept these context diﬀerences can boost this dimen‐
sion.
9. Respect. Being interested in the host country citizens and casual friendliness
towards them should be relevant as cross-cultural understandings. For instance,
willingness to participate in activities distinctive to the host country will raise a
fundamental respect for others and might lead to an appreciation of his/her current
state. It is likely that CCR listeners will raise respect toward locals after they
recognize the cultural diﬀerence. It is also greatly connected to the self-reﬂection
process.
10. Relationship. Inclination to establish and maintain a relationship regardless of the
skills is one crucial dimension. Even though this can be inﬂuenced by an individ‐
ual’s personal character such as being extrovert or introvert, we should be aware
that every individual has his/her own pace for building it. For instance, not all
introverts are weak in relationship building than extroverts; they will establish
deeper and more stable relationship with others.
After the correspondent literatures are reviewed and dimensions mentioned above
were rationalized, this new criteria was named “CCUS (Cross-Cultural Understanding
Scale)”. In the evaluation phase, measurement users score each dimensions from 1 to
10, using self-evaluation method. This evaluation is conducted twice, before and after
any related experiment such as ﬁeldwork or interview. Afterwards two score results are
compared and discussed.

Evaluation Experiment
4.1
Method
We conducted ﬁeldwork for three international tourists as CCR listeners (participant
CH2, CH3 and UZ), using the same scheme to explore how the cycle of CCR works.
CH2 and CH3 are 24 and 25-year-old females, both from China. UZ is 22-year-old male
from Uzbekistan. CH2 and CH3 are close friends and took part in the ﬁeldwork together
in November 2015. Later they participated in the ﬁeldwork again, focused on the
contents Tourist this time.
First, we distributed an experiment instruction sheet to the participants. Fieldwork
route is printed and they were asked to walk and listen to the contents (Guidebook and
Locals in ﬁrst ﬁeldwork and Tourists in second ﬁeldwork) mapped into the route in the
numeric order (Fig. 6). Before they start to walk, they ﬁlled in the CCUS form. We took
pictures of participants while they are walking (Fig. 7). Fieldwork was done either in
English or Japanese, depending on participant’s language ability. Conversation was
recorded and after they listened to all contents numbered, they ﬁlled in the CCUS form
again.

Result
Figure 8 is the average score of three participants’ CCUS ten dimensions, the blue line
is before the ﬁeldwork, and the red line is after they listened to the contents Guidebook
and Locals, and the green line is after they listened to the contents Tourists. We see some
dimensions such as “language skills”, “interaction” and “nonverbal communication”
were improved after the ﬁeldwork. On the contrary, we also see the decline in “mobility”
and “awareness of cultural diﬀerence”.

Behavioral Analysis of Participants
As shown in the result, CCR has enriched some aspects of cultural dimensions. We will
have a closer look at individual participant’s score focusing on the contents Tourists,
referring comparative study by Ito [20], particularly dealt with the contents Guidebook
and Locals.

Nakamise-dori. As illustrated in blue line in Fig. 6, walking along Nakamise-dori and
going through Senso-ji premises is the most popular route of Asakusa sightseeing. Since
CH2 has never been in Asakusa until ﬁrst ﬁeldwork, she is a beginner tourist in a way.
It is reasonable to assume that she was delighted with the route recommendation as her
ﬁrst visit and had positive impression for the ﬁeldwork.

Fig. 10. Participant CH2’s CCUS score. (Color ﬁgure online)
At Senso-ji she listened to the contents Tourists about the fortune slip, a previous
ﬁeldwork participant buying one inﬂuenced by the contents Guidebook (Fig. 9).
CH2 thought she might try it too, and purchased her own fortune slip after she listened
to the contents. The slip’s front was written in both Japanese and English, and she found
its back was all in Chinese, saying “all ﬂowers bloom when spring is approaching, if
you are having something bad, it’s time to be patient until the spring”. She seemed quite
surprised and said “it’s comfortable to know the meaning of the fortune exactly right in
my language”. For her, getting the essence of Japanese culture in her own language must
have been an event to promote “nonverbal communication” and “awareness of cultural
diﬀerence” between China and Japan, as well as a trigger to interact with host culture
which are illustrated as improvement in Fig. 10. Besides, from the guidebook tips she
learned Senso-ji has a lot of bad (or worse) fortune slips while she actually got the second
best. Hypothetically, a fun moment when she got lucky carried on until the end of the
ﬁeldwork, and aﬀected to the overall positive evaluation after the ﬁeldwork.
5.2
Participant CH3 (Fig. 11)
CH2 and CH3 are both studying abroad students and CH3 has arrived in Japan a year
before CH2, so she knows more about Japanese society, lifestyle and culture than CH2.
Although Fig. 11 shows some dimensions have declined after listening to the contents
Tourists compared to Guidebook and Locals, CH3 has improved “interaction”,
“nonverbal communication” and “relationship” amongst ten dimensions. She did not
purchase any fortune slip like CH2 but was watching her buying one, talked about the
The Behavioral Analysis for Cross-Cultural Understandings
225

result in Chinese. Knowing Japanese culture through the conversation with CH2 counts
as indirect cultural exchange and aﬀected her relative improvement of dimensions. At
the same time, interaction with CH2 in her own language actually worked as a homo‐
geneity booster rather than recognizing a diﬀerence between Japanese culture, which
explains a drop of “awareness of cultural diﬀerence”. After the ﬁeldwork, she
commented “this time the explanation in English (contents Tourist) is more interesting
than last time (contents Guidebook and Locals) because we could know what other
foreign tourists think about Japanese culture” and told the ﬁeldwork experience was
enjoyable.

Because of ﬁnancial reason lots of residents are leaving the city and ﬂowing into Tosh‐
kent, the capital of Uzbekistan nowadays and he feels sad about it. He wishes people in
Samarkand will love their city just like as Asakusa locals. He felt something in common
with Japanese people and cultivated aﬃnity toward host culture, which has appeared as
the improvement of “awareness of cultural diﬀerence”. After the ﬁeldwork he

On the other hand, after he listened to the contents Tourists about religion in Japan
(Fig. 12), he observed Japanese visitors throwing coins into the oﬀertory box of Senso-
ji. He told he is respectful of Japanese religious style, yet as a Muslim he wants to stick
at his belief and would not to oﬀer coins. This experience might have improved his
“interaction” and “respect” by raising awareness of how people in diﬀerent cultural
backgrounds connect their religious beliefs into their daily lives.

Conclusion and Future Studies
In this paper we proposed place oriented internet radio called “CCR (Cross-Cultural
Radio)” by providing three types of contents; “Guidebook”, “Locals” and “Tourists”.
To validate the eﬀectiveness of this unique media, we also suggested “CCUS (Cross-
Cultural Understanding Scale)” as new criteria to measure the level of cross-cultural
understandings. According to the result of evaluation experiment conducted in Tokyo
for three participants, it is reasonable to assume CCR has contributed to the enhancement
of several aspects of culture. Besides, through advanced behavioral analysis for indi‐
vidual participants focused on the contents Tourists, we found a certain listening expe‐
rience can be triggers of participants’ voluntary action or contemplation of themselves,
which helps them to gain new cultural perspectives.
For the future work, we will design and develop a variety of place oriented contents
especially focuses on Tourists, which includes deﬁning process of contents promote
aﬃnity towards culture. Recruiting more participants for the evaluation experiment is
crucial to make CCR more solid and reliable media. To enhance cross-cultural under‐
standings for foreign visitors in Japan, we should test if the same scheme works not only
in Asakusa but also in diﬀerent cities of Japan, or it signiﬁcantly varies depending on
The Behavioral Analysis for Cross-Cultural Understandings
227

the characteristics of the place. One possibility of the evaluation experiment is
employing Japanese tourists as participants for a comparative research to internationals.

Abstract. This study intends to explore child patrons’ interaction with robots
by assessing the interpersonal distance under a speciﬁc context of library. In
addition to the general exploration on human preference and performance in
HRI, it is expected to understand more profoundly the activities and intentions
people possessed through the systematical investigation of interaction context
and structural measurement of interpersonal distance. Previous studies in
human-robot interaction have suggested several factors that are important
including robots’ appearance, users’ features and their perceptions of robots.
However, studies regarding child users are few, and the understanding of
children’s attitudes toward robots remains limited due to insufﬁcient or unem-
pirical supports. Studies regarding the human-robot interaction support that the
personal space also appears inevitably that reﬂects human intentions to interact
with the robots. In addition, another critical but less-explored factor that affect
human-robot interaction is contextual effect. Contextual cues are what people
sense and rely on to proceed with conversations, and cannot be overlooked in
the exploration of any interaction.
This study recruited 77 elementary students from 3rd–6th grade and assigned
the task to be recommended the book from the robot in the library. The personal
space that the participants kept with different appearance robots and the attitude
they had to the robot were recorded and analyzed. The result showed that the
participants had positive attitude to the robots and felt comfort when interacting
with robots. Among them, girls were more positive than the boys. Additionally,
the one that interacted with human-like robot kept the personal space closer
than the one that interacted with machine-like robot. The former one interacted
with the robot in intimate space that indicates that the participants took the
library as a private space and thought the robot as their close friend.

Introduction
For many public libraries, child patrons are one of the major user groups, and they are
also the most active users in the library [1]. Viewing children as the future clients,
public libraries actually devote many efforts to do researches or activities for child
patrons. However, difﬁculties may be encountered due to child patrons’ physical limits
or literacy skills that hindered their use of the library resources. It is often that child
patrons need and require librarians or adults’ help to get library services and resources,
therefore an assistive agent is of help to child patrons’ library use.
Human interaction involves various intentions and actions that reﬂected these
intentions. A typical representation of the phenomena is described by Hall [2] as the
“personal space,” where people stay in a certain distance in an interaction to show their
intentions to interact with the others and the current situation [3]. When the distance
between two people is short that may mean their relationship is close, and vice versa.
Studies regarding the human-robot interaction support that the personal space also
appears inevitably [4] that reﬂects human intentions to interact with the robots. In
addition, another critical but less-explored factor that affect human-robot interaction is
contextual effect [5]. Contextual cues are what people sense and rely on to proceed with
conversations, and cannot be overlooked in the exploration of any interaction.
Motivated by the aforementioned issues, this study intends to explore child patrons’
interaction with robots by assessing the interpersonal distance under a speciﬁc context
of library. In addition to the general exploration on human preference and performance
in HRI, it is expected to understand more profoundly the activities and intentions
people possessed through the systematical investigation of interaction context and
structural measurement of interpersonal distance.

Research Design
This study investigates the personal space and the attitude that child patrons possessed
under different kinds of contexts in order to better understand child patrons’ thinking
toward the library robots. To obtain valid data, a designated experiment was conducted
to extract insight from users’ actual behaviors instead of reported opinions and
impression without actual experience. Also, to better understand how child patrons’
behave in different contexts, this research used the factors that discussed in previous
studies: users’ age, gender, and robots’ appearance as variables to see the difference.
Quasi-experiment was therefore adopted as the proper research method to approach the
context targeted by this research.
To understand child patrons’ feelings and movements in the interaction with the
robot, this study used two robots of different appearance: the human-like robot named
“Julia”, compared to the machine-like robot named “Book Smile”. Except for the
appearance, the technical specs of the two robots were identical. Both robots were
equipped with lasers to detect obstacle and participant’s feet for measuring distance
data automatically.
During the experiment, the users’ personal space would be measured and the
movement of the participant would be observed through the task. First, the users’
230
W. Lin and H.-P. Yueh

personal space would be measured and taken by the robot during the book recom-
mending and retrieving tasks. Also, the action of the participant would be observed and
recorded during the entire experiment process by the video camera to see what kinds of
facial expressions, movements, or other body languages the participant had to the robot.
This study also developed the paper-based questionnaire after the experiment task
to investigate the participants’ attitude to robots, the participants’ robot appearance
preference, and the participants’ demographic information. The instruments were
modiﬁed versions from the robot anxiety scale (RAS) and Negative attitudes toward
robots scale (NARS) from Nomura, Kanda, Suzuki, and Kato’s research [6]. The
reliability and validity of the instrument was tested and sufﬁcient (Cronbach’s
a = 0.77).

Preliminary Findings
This study recruited 77 participants from 3rd grade to 6th grade (age 9–12) from an
elementary school in Taipei. And the experiments were conducted in the library of this
elementary school. The ratio of gender was 34:43 (boy: girl). All participants partici-
pated in the experiments under their free wills and parents’ consents, and one partic-
ipant dropped out during the experiment, which made the valid sample of 76 persons.
These participants were divided into two groups to interact with robots with human-like
appearance and machine-like appearance respectively.
3.1
Participants’ Personal Space and Attitude Toward Robots
of Different Appearance
To investigate whether the robot’s appearance will affect the personal space the par-
ticipants’ keep from the robot. The study used the data from human-like robot (Julia)
group and machine-like robot (Book Smile) group to run independent groups of T-test
to see the difference. The descriptive statistics shown that when the participant inter-
acted with the human-like robot, the average personal space was 0.35 m, which was the
level of intimate space according to Hall (1966) (distance < 0.45 m). On the other
hand, the participant who interacted with the machine-like robot, Book Smile, per-
formed the personal space in 0.75 m. Although the later one was relatively far than the
former one, the personal space that the participant shown was still in the level of
personal space (distance < 1.2 m) which represented that the participant were willing
to interact with the robot from social space to the closer space—personal space.

The Relationship Between Robot Appearance and Interaction
231

There were signiﬁcant differences existed in the personal space between the
human-like robot (Julia) group and the machine-like robot (Book Smile) group. The
personal space the participants kept when interacting with Julia was signiﬁcantly closer
than the other group. In addition, participants would approach the human-like robot
(Julia) to take the book, and stayed in front of the robot to read the content. However,
the participant would backward immediately after taking the book from the
machine-like robot (Book Smile), and read the content in certain distance away from
the robot (Table 1).
To investigate whether the robot’s appearance will affect the attitude the partici-
pants’ had to the robot. The study used the questionnaire data from human-like robot
(Julia) group and machine-like robot (Book Smile) group to run independent groups of
T-test to see the difference. Different groups of the participants’ comfort attitude to the
robot were shown in Table 2.
The results showed that the comfort attitude that participants had were positive.
Among all the questions, the Julia group scored the “I feel comforted being with robots
that have emotions” highest (M = 4.59). Also, the participants felt least comfortable
when the robots approached them. This may because that the participants didn’t know
they were going to interact with the robot before the experiment and felt confused.
However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between two groups of the participants.
In the feeling of the library tasks, the results were positive which showed that the
participants were willing to have robots to recommend readings. Also, the scores of the
feeling of the task were higher than the robot attitude. The participants regarded robots
as communicable and trustworthy, also they felt the conversations with the library
robot were relevant. The overall data showed that the participants’ attitude toward the
two robots was not signiﬁcantly different. Despite of different appearance, a possible
inference was that the both robots had the features and functions that the children
preferred. While Julia and Book Smile robot used cartoon-like design concepts and
elements, the results might not reﬂect signiﬁcant difference in the two groups.

3.2
Gender Difference in Personal Space and Attitude Toward
Different Robots
To investigate whether the participants’ gender would affect the personal space the
participants’ keep from the robot. The study used the data from boy and girl groups to
run independent groups of T-test to see the difference. The results showed that when the
boy interacted with the robot, the average personal space was 0.72 m, which was the
level of personal space (distance < 1.2 m). On the other hand, the girl who interacted
with the robot (girl features) performed the personal space in 0.43 m, which was in the
range of intimate space (distance < 0.45 m), and was closer than the former one. It may
be said that the girl was more willing to interact with the robot than the boy (Table 3).
The results of the t-test analysis showed signiﬁcant difference between the boys and
girls groups. The personal space the girls kept when interacting with the robot was
signiﬁcantly closer than the boys. This could also be translated as that girls regarded the
robot as their close friends or family more than the boys. Similar results also applied
when the participants interacted with the machine-like robot, Book Smile. The girls
also stayed in closer distance with the robot than the boy.
To investigate whether the participants’ gender will affect their attitudes toward the
robot, the result showed that participants’ attitude toward both robots was positive. And
the girls had better comfort attitude to the robots than the boy. Additionally, although both
gender were willing to make friend with a robot of emotions, the results showed that the
girl (M = 4.71, S.D. = 1.37) were more willing than the boy (M = 4.12, S.D. = 1.63).
However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between two groups of the participants in the
comfort attitude part. In the feelings of the library tasks, the girls were more positive than
the boys to have the robots recommended readings. In addition, girls perceived the
conversations with robots as signiﬁcantly more relevant than boys (t (76) = –3.44,
p < .01).
The participants liked the robot with no human-like appearance, arms, and emotion.
However, in the monitor and facial features parts, there were signiﬁcant differences
between the boys and the girls: girls liked the robot with monitor (M = 4.60, S.D. = 1.94)
and facial features (M = 3.83, S.D. = 1.82) more than the boy felt about the monitor
(M = 2.71, S.D. = 2.02) and the facial features (M = 2.71, S.D. = 1.95). The results
showed that the boys had less positive attitude than the girls in all attitude parts. This may
be the reason that the boys stayed farer than the girls when interacting with the robot
(Table 4).

The Relationship Between Robot Appearance and Interaction
233

To summarize, both gender and robot appearance would affect the personal space
that the participants kept from the robot. Participants would interact with human-like
robot in the intimate space (m < 0.45) despite of the robot’s gender. On the other hand,
when interacting, the participants would stay in a farther space (personal space, m < 1.2)
with machine-like robot. The results regarding gender difference supported ﬁndings of
the previous studies [7, 8], and proved that participants perceived a same-gender robot
more positive and psychologically close than the opposite-gender robot.

Conclusion
This study has discussed the personal space and the attitude in interaction between
child patrons and robots under different contexts. It was established by analyzing the
distance, video, and questionnaire data of the child patrons’ attitude and the behaviors.
The results showed that the child patrons were willing to interact with the robots for the
book recommending services. Also, they are willing to read the book with and from the
robot. The appearances of the robots affected the interaction between the child patrons
and the robot. When the participants interacted with the human-like robot, they tended
to interact in intimate space; on the other hand, the participant who interacted with the
machine-like robot would prefer to interact in personal space.
The results also suggested gender differences in the child patrons’ interaction with
the robots. The personal space that the girls interacted with the robot was closer than
the boys. And the attitude that the girls had to the robot was also more positive than the
boy. That is to say that the robots’ appearance and the child patrons’ gender factor
would affect the personal space that the child patrons and the robot interacted with.
The study was distinct from previous studies of HRI space [9, 10] by its
context-speciﬁc research design. With the direct and automatic measurement of the
distance, bias and ambiguity could be avoided. And the personal space was examined
in the real world, where the library context, robot instruments and interaction were all
genuine, the ﬁndings contributed to provide empirical evidence for the research and
practices of the ﬁeld.

This study started from Taiwan to establish one aspect of the child patrons’ per-
sonal space in the library with the robot. The results showed that the gender and the
robots’ appearance do affect the personal space; also the gender would affect the
attitude that the child patrons have. This may be the reference for the library to conduct
the robot service and its content. However, it should be noted that the study was limited
by the participants’ background. In this study, the participants were all the students
from Taiwan, where the students may feel less familiar than other countries that
develop robots maturely. As Bartneck [11] indicated, the cultural background had a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on people’s attitude to robots. Hence, the opinions and the per-
sonal space of the robot may be different when the experiment is conducted in other
countries. Yet, the study’s results are still the good references when the library is
considering introducing the robot service in the future.

Introduction
Earthquake is one of the most powerful disasters in the world. More than 300
million people have been seriously aﬀected in the earthquake at 20 century.
There are more than 18 % areas, and 12 % populations on earth are under the
risk, and the earthquake may come suddenly without any advancing warning.
No matter how advanced technology we have, human lives remain fragile in the
face of earthquakes, because major survival technologies may corrupt.
In China, the underdeveloped western areas often suﬀer from deadly earth-
quake made worse by poor infrastructure and planning. It takes time for the out-
side rescue resources to reach the stricken areas, making the existing resources
become far more inessential in the golden rescue areas. Ensuring the supply of
food and safe drinking water and trying to restore good sanitation are critical,
which help save more lives. However, every single resource allocation is based
on the eﬃciency of communication. Taking the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, for
instance, the damages of the base stations, the lacking of electricity, and the
traﬃc jam caused by exceeded number of users all exacerbated the eﬃciency
of communication. The main goals of designing Persephone rescue system is to
make every user stays notices, informed and connected in case of severe after-
math situations. Persephone helps users stay noticed, informed and targeted by
opening up an entrance for the ﬁrst time rescue and information exchange among
victims. Based on the combination of P2P meshed network and the traditional
cellular services, the success and eﬃciency of Persephone are based on mutual

help, a number of participants and the delayed data accumulation. As a result,
our design purpose is to increase user participation and increase the time user
stay online. Users take advantages of Persephone to get access to the informa-
tion they need. The concealed meaning, which is hard detected by users in the
process of interaction. When a user is trying to connect others, he or she is also
the crucial bridge of information delivery. In the other words, when a user is
sending out a message asking for help, meanwhile the user himself or herself is
also a signiﬁcant node help others exchange information in the whole system.
The resource data generated by groups of users could also help government and
organizations conduct the resource allocation management. Consequently, it is
crucial to promote user participation and residence time on Persephone app thus
to promote better group eﬀects. In order to develop a comprehensive approach
to the user experience of Persephone, authors probe into user demands and psy-
chology through a series of user research.

Research Methodology
When the presence of every individual user is a signiﬁcant part of the whole res-
cue system, and the beneﬁt from this group value may also return to the user,
the key point of getting better group beneﬁts is to make the long-term eﬀect and
group beneﬁt perceivable and foreseeable by the participated users in the process
of service receiving. The authors accumulated the data to analyze social-related
thinking models, rescue concepts and current rescue behaviors of various vic-
tims survived in Wenchuan earthquake by the methodology of persona analyze.
Then we organized the data with the framework of POMES (people, object,
environment, message, service), structured the user needs, and sort out the rela-
tionship between users role-related behaviors and their corresponding mental
perceptions. Then the authors explored the possible development of Persephone
service design guidelines to help users have better emotional control, perspec-
tive taking, and to show expression of respect. On the purpose of the conversion
from the user demands to design guidelines, the research applies the model of
Means-end Chain and uses it to transform diﬀerent kinds of user demands to
the corresponding guidelines for service design.
2.1
Data Accumulation
Survey. A survey of 28 survivors from 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake through
persona analyze by the in-depth interview and a ﬁve-person focus group. They
are college students, government oﬃcers, merchants, and soldiers. Each in-
depth interview is about 40 min. We ask people to describe their experiences
of Wenchuan Earthquake. Following, we designed several scenarios by showing
them video documentaries and coming up with questions. We ask them about
their choices, demands, behaviors, and psychological movements. For the focus
group, the researchers displayed some typical problems and demands gathered
from the in-depth interviews, and came up with some design proposals. The
researchers piled up rich data with tones of video, photos and recordings.

Questionaire. Methods to conduct the survey by sending out a questionnaire
to 514 people of diﬀerent ages and occupations came from earthquake belt areas
like Wenchuan, Beichuan, Mianzhu, Chongqing, Baoji, and Xian. We greatly
enriched data by questionnaires.
2.2
POEMS and Personal Analysis
After research of data collection, we input all the data into an Excel spread-
sheet in accordance with the construction of POEMS (Fig. 1). POEMS considers
people, object, environment, message, service and other factors synthetically. It
is suitable for analysis of large amounts of qualitative data [3].
Fig. 1. User needs in aftermath scenarios
We categorized user demands into 11 dimensions (Fig. 2). The diameter of
each axis is the inﬂuence of such user need, which is positively correlated to the
certain numbers of times user mentioned directly and indirectly. Location- relat-
ing communication are the universal demanding shared by all users, no matter
they are the people who need help, who oﬀer help, who can only help themselves,
organizations, government, reporters and other kinds of data collection volun-
teers. The second rank comes to the resource sharing, which are food, water,
medical treatment and other kinds of life supporting materials. The third rank
comes to the feeling statement including the senses of existence and emotion
expression.
It is found that users demands are according to their roles in the situation
(Fig. 3). We analyzed all the needs of types of users and narrowed down user
roles and characters into three typical persona, resource demanders, resource
providers and observers. As time goes by, user roles can convent from one to the
other. The shape of the groups is relating to the tendency of role changing. The
group of “I am safe” is the buﬀer pole of the community. The amount of people
who are oﬀering help increases from the buﬀer pole. Meanwhile, the number
of people who need help decreases and add numbers to the buﬀer pole. There
are also a group of people like reporters and college students who are the roles
like the bridges and speakers of the information broadcasting. They link the
disastrous areas and outside areas together, oﬀer the information and news on
both sides, and help organizations and governments make rescue strategies and

allocate resources. By thinking about the needs of the ﬁctional personas, we are
better able to infer what a real person might need. Such inference assisted with
our latter brainstorming, case speciﬁcation and features deﬁnition.
Fig. 3. Characters and roles
We classiﬁed user needs and related them into four social cognitive and psy-
chological need categories, the norm of reciprocity, empathy, self-actualization
and the sense of security (Fig. 4). Resource demanders are the users who’re
behaviors of getting resources are dominating in their whole movement. They
can be the victims who are injured looking for medical support, who are starv-
ing searching for food or water, who are helping others ﬁnding life- support-
ing materials. This group of users could have the possibility to be changed
into resource providers or observers once their resource demanding are relieved.
The resource providers are the group of people whose main movements are
providing life-supporting materials to people who need them. The resources
they are providing can be physical stuﬀlike food, water, medical equipment, as
well as labour power. They can be individuals, group, organizations. Once the
resource is running out, they may turn into observers. Observers mainly consist of
people who are currently safe, do not need extra support but also do not have
extra resources to share with others in general. They are the people survived

and observe the situations. They could turn into the resource supporters due to
the organizations, guidances and self-emotional will. There are also some people
who can be essential in terms of macroscopic data generation, the journalists
and information collectors, who belongs to the group of observers. They are the
most active and up-and-coming groups in the disastrous areas, who link data
and information as well as peoples mental relationship. There are some demands
like “Communication”, “location broadcast”, and “launch relatives”, which are
demanding to connect people together into collaboration.
Fig. 4. User need of Persephone service and user experience
The norm of reciprocity is the expectation that users will respond favorably
to each other by returning beneﬁts for beneﬁts, and responding with either indif-
ference or hostility to harms [4]. The norm of reciprocity could be the motivation
and also the surveillance to promoting users be a part of the system. Even if a
user is neither seeking for help or oﬀering help, it is sensible to stay online in
terms of “Norm of Reciprocity”. Embedding the idea of the core technique of
the P2P meshed network in the service design is a good way to chase for the
“Norm of Reciprocity”. Every user is a signiﬁcant node for the whole informa-
tion change, especially for the users who is a single bridge between two group
of users, which is indispensable. However, for the government, public opinions
supervise their behaviors when they do the resource statistic and allocating and
strategy making.
Self-actualization is a term that has been used in various psychology theo-
ries, the quest for spiritual enlightenment. The concept was brought most fully
to prominence in Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory as the ﬁnal
level of psychological development that can be achieved. Showing how much
inﬂuence a single users behavior has on the whole. Every small step of further

approaching on help oﬀering deserves a feedback, which is a subconscious and
implicit motivation that encouraging users to explore more.
The sense of security is essential and for the people who is calling for help,
which oﬀers them courage and patience in the severe situation. The sense of
security is essential. For the people who is calling for help, the sense of security
oﬀers them courage and patience in the severe situation. One of a good way
to chase the sense of security is to enhance the frequency communication and
decrease the chances that messages had been sent out but had no return. Each
users status will be visible to all users in the same area, users can tap the note
to see every users current status.

Service Design Strategies for Promoting User
Experience in Individual Moments
3.1
Roles and Characters
There are three roles, “I need help”, “I am safe” and “I am safe and I can oﬀer
help”. In addition, to being themselves (Presenting their own name and contact
information), users can choose the roles representing their current status accord-
ing to their dominating behaviors in the aftermath situation. During the chaotic
situation, as resources are limited to access and people are more sensitive to
the uncertainty than usual, message exchanging should be more accurate, brief
and comprehensible. We should enable users who are in severe situations using
as fewer operations as possible to send out the crucial life-supporting informa-
tion. When selecting “I need help”, the tags of “medical”, “water”, “food”, and
“electricity” appear for them to select, and multi-selection is supported. The
“medical” tag will be selected by default, users can touch the tag to remove
selection (Fig. 5).
Fig. 5. User Roles and Characters; 3–1 User Centre; 3–2 “I need help”; 3–3 “I am safe
and I can oﬀer help”; 3–4 “I am safe”
This design is in perspective of building the sense of security, which means the
more severe and emergency the situations are, the fewer operations the users need

Service Design Strategies for Long-Term Eﬀects that Individual Moments
243
to do, and the most crucial information will always be launched to the public.
The same tags go for the role of “I am safe and I can oﬀer help”, by means
of achieving the sense of consistency, and making everything comprehensible
and eﬃciency. Three roles can be changed due to the slider bar by very easy
operations as users role could change over time. The updated information of users
role will be broadcasted to the public one minute after user editing to prevent
false operation, and to increase information change eﬃciency by minimizing
information load over the whole system.
3.2
Location and Resource Launching
For people to pay attention to something, they must ﬁrst perceive it [6]. Every-
thing is based on Bing map, including who is nearby, and their roles related
resource status (Fig. 6). According to the norm of reciprocity, the expectation
that users will respond favorably to each other by returning beneﬁts for bene-
ﬁts [4].
Fig. 6. Location, resource launch, and people nearby
Every movement of a single user can be accessed by the nearby users made
the norm of reciprocity visible by each user. In real situations, a user can have
a dominating role as “I need help” or “I am safe and I can oﬀer help”, and
also be an observer on the third perspective. Being a part of the system and
out of the system at the same time, users will get attentions of other and get
noticed by others at the same time. People are motivated by progress, mastery
and control. When they feel they are learning and mastering the situation, they
are more motivated to be part of it [6]. Also perceiving something does not
mean paying attention to something, the existing features of making everyone
feels a sense of control in the chaotic situation could not only motivate people
reacting more in the dimensions of information sharing and exchange, but also
help resource supporters getting the sense of self- actualization, and encourage
them to explore more.

3.3
Emotional Design Respect: People, Families and Friends
After earthquakes, people are scared, hurt and helpless. They want to contact
their families, friends, people they are familiar with. They want to obtain food,
water and other life-supporting resources. They want to help and help others.
No matter the resource demanders, the resources supporters or the observers,
the safety of their friends and relatives is one of the universal demanding. Users
can send out a sentence of words to families and friends in from self-information
editing centre (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, how far the information could reach could
be told by users on the user centre page through the sentence “Your status
card has been sent to X Person”, which is based on the norm of reciprocity and
empathy for each other. Users creating bridges for information exchange with
people nearby, and they help each other survive. Users can sense what another
person is experiencing from within the other person’s frame of reference, and the
capacity to place oneself in other’s position [5]. Making people become bonds of
information delivery for each other, motivate people to stay online. The success
and eﬃciency of Persephone are based on mutual help, a number of participants
and the delayed data accumulation. Based on the norm of reciprocity, the more
users stay online, the more chance users get to ﬁnd the information of their
relatives and friends.
3.4
Communications and Notiﬁcations
Fig. 7. Notiﬁcation
Users can launch a targeted user on the resource map
to do the information exchange, using other users as the
bridge of message delivery. “The Group chat” is added to
the system as one of the communication features. Doing
things together bonds people together, and people who
engaged in synchronizing activities are more cooperative in
completing subsequent tasks (Scott Wiltermuth and Chip
Heath, 2009). Group activities could be organized in group
chat, and build the sense of security for each single user.
Notiﬁcation (Fig. 7) is the window to receive information
from the outside of the disastrous areas. The notiﬁcation
could be editing from Perseboard, which is the data buﬀer
running on Azure.

Conclusion
This research is based on the service design of Persephone, an aftermath res-
cue system taking advantage of P2P meshed network. Through user research
based on the methodology of persona and POEMS, and sort out the relationship
between users role-related behaviors and their corresponding mental perceptions,
and transform diﬀerent kinds of user demands to the corresponding guidelines
for service design in the perspectives of “The norm of reciprocity”, “Empathy”,

Service Design Strategies for Long-Term Eﬀects that Individual Moments

“Self-actualisation” and “The sense of security”. By probing into design strate-
gies of every single part of the real-time user experiences of an aftermath rescue
service system “Persephone”, the authors explored the possible development of
Persephone service design to help users have better emotional control, perspec-
tive taking, to show expression of respect in the process of service receiving,
thus promotes the long-term eﬀects that individual moments have on the whole.
However, the study has its limits in data supporting because of the few amount
of data samples. Although typical, the aftermath situation Wenchuan earth-
quake cant represent the whole China. Enrich the source of data accumulation
could help us explore more possibilities of design strategies that could promote
long-term eﬀects by enriching user experiences in individual moments.

Abstract. This paper builds up a picture of how multilingualism is supported in
various aspects of urban online spaces. The main assumption of this study is that
language is an indispensable element of culture; thus, understanding how a
multilingual city facilitates multilingualism in terms of provision of and access
to information, can deepen our understanding for supporting cross-cultural
Human Computer Interaction (HCI). This study explores how multilingualism is
supported in urban online spaces of Limassol, a location of increased inward
migration and a city that holds a prolonged multilingual character. Data include
manifestations of multilingualism or monolingualism in various online contexts,
such as ofﬁcial websites and digital media. Findings demonstrate several aspects
of multilingualism, as well as implemented policies and practices for promoting
a multilingual online locus. As a result of the ﬁndings, suggestions for best
practices for the online spaces of multilingual cities are put forward, as well as
implications for cross-cultural HCI.

Introduction
The multicultural and multilingual character of today’s communities is reﬂected in
day-to-day encounters with people, in business transactions, in education, in adver-
tisements, road signs, media and online spaces. As cultural diversity has become a new
challenge for Human Computer Interaction (HCI), there is a need for reviewing and
evaluating the study of culture in HCI in a systematic way [1, 2]. The main assumption
of this study is that language is a fundamental element of culture; thus, understanding
how a multilingual city facilitates multilingualism in terms of provision of and access
to information, can deepen our understanding for supporting cross-cultural HCI. This
study explores how multilingualism and plurilingualism are supported in the urban
online spaces of Limassol, a location of increased inward migration and a city that
holds a prolonged multilingual character [3]. The study is an attempt to bring forward
important aspects of cross-cultural HCI, such as language visibility and invisibility,
linguistic support at the level of governance or policy, as well as social inclusion and

intercultural dialogue in online spaces. The study also looks into the challenges and
obstacles involved in creating and managing multilingualism in linguistically diverse
online spaces. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the current
situation of multilingualism as this is manifested in urban online spaces in signiﬁcant
spheres or aspects of the city life; that is (a) the public sphere, (b) educational sphere,
(c) economic life and (d) the private lives of citizens. The aforementioned four key
spheres are delineated in order to provide for comprehensive exploration of how
multilingualism is depicted in online spaces of city life. Ultimately, this paper builds up
a picture of how multilingualism is supported in signiﬁcant online aspects of multi-
lingual citizen communities. The study is related to the research activities of a wider
network of different European cities who attempted to sketch multilingualism in dif-
ferent cities (see also, [4, 5]).

Short History of Language Diversity in Limassol
Cyprus has historically had a multilingual and multicultural character since ancient
times. This, however, is now more evident than ever before. The population compo-
sition of Cyprus today is largely heterogeneous as the country is inhabited by people of
diverse cultural backgrounds. In the past, migration in Cyprus used to be associated
with large-scale emigration of Cypriots abroad in the early twentieth century in search
of jobs and better standards of living; and later between 1960 and 1975, especially
following the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974, to countries such as the UK, the
USA and Australia [6]. More recently, however, Cyprus has experienced a large wave
of inward migration due to various world events and situations that have sent numerous
groups of people in Cyprus searching for relocation opportunities.
For historical reasons, the most commonly spoken languages in Cyprus in general
are Greek by Greek-Cypriots, and Turkish by Turkish-Cypriots since the Ottoman Era
(1571–1878). Under Article 3 of the Constitution, Greek and Turkish are both ofﬁcial
languages, but de facto they are used as such in the Republic of Cyprus and the
occupied area respectively. As a principle, the Republic of Cyprus government
recognises to members of all religious groups and communities the right to use their
own language in private and in public, and to receive instruction in it. The Greek
Community in Cyprus use both Standard Modern Greek (SMG) – the ofﬁcial language
in Greece – and the Greek Cypriot dialect, which belongs to the South-Eastern Greek
subgroup and is considered to have remained closer to ancient Greek because of its
isolation.
Greek has no legal status in the occupied area. The Turkish currently spoken in
Cyprus is the Turkish Cypriot dialect and mainland Turkish, the latter mainly imported
by settlers and troops. Before 1974, Turkish was used in all services (together with
Greek and English) in the Republic of Cyprus. Since the 1974 division, the use of
Turkish has been discontinued, as most Turkish-Cypriots were displaced to the
occupied area of the island. However, in the Republic of Cyprus it is still used in
passports, identity cards, birth certiﬁcates and other ofﬁcial documents. It is also offered
as an elective language in government schools.

Other languages and cultures also left their mark on Cyprus. English has always
had a strong presence on the island because of the island’s colonial history. English
was the ofﬁcial language during the British Administration in 1878–1960. As a result, it
has left a strong linguistic inﬂuence on the island. English has been used as the lingua
franca, by both communities along with Greek, and by other people who now live in
Cyprus. It is used in many domains such as business, tourism and education. French
was used during medieval times (1192–1489), and Italian during the Venetian Rule
(1489–1571). Assyrians, Persians, Arabs and others also spent some time in Cyprus
during different times for various reasons and left their linguistic and cultural mark on
the island. All these languages and cultures have enriched the linguistic and cultural
mosaic of Cyprus through the centuries.
Limassol is the second largest city in Cyprus, with a population of 235.056 [7], the
largest city on the island in geographical size, and also the largest port in the
Mediterranean transit trade. Limassol today includes ﬁve municipalities. In the last
decades, Limassol has developed into one of the most important maritime, tourism,
commercial and service centres in the area. Limassol is also known for its long tradition
in cultural issues. It gives the possibility to the visitors to attend a great number of
activities and visit many museums and archaeological sites. Foreign populations
residing in Limassol are of a diverse cultural and linguistic background. Greece and the
UK are among the top countries sending immigrants to Cyprus in general and to
Limassol in speciﬁc. Other foreign populations hail from countries such as Russia,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon,
Jordan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, India, Bangladesh and China (Limassol: Results of
the Intercultural Cities Index, 2011). Due to the geographic location of Limassol,
people from all over the world call Limassol their home. Although the majority of
Limassolians are Greek-speaking, other languages like English, Russian, Arabic,
Chinese, Indian, or Vietnamese are also heard in the street, and a mixture of cultures is
evident in everyday life.

Multilingualism in Online Spaces
To be able to explore important aspects of cross-cultural HCI in online spaces and ﬁnd
out whether people communicate interculturally effectively, we needed to examine if
there is evidence in online space for understanding cultural differences and share
cultural information and meanings effectively. But what does an online space, a website
entail? According to Papadima-Sophocleous [8], “a web page is usually a combination
of text and visuals, sometimes accompanied by sound, and in more sophisticated cases
information is presented in a multimedia form (text, buttons, images, photos, anima-
tion, sound, video, and special effects)”. In terms of text, one needs to consider which
language or languages are used and which form of the language(s). Visuals and
symbols complementing or supporting the meaning of the text need to be carefully
selected as they may have a different meaning in different cultures. And if a web site is
more sophisticated, one needs to consider how much this helps understanding the
message by users from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

A. Parmaxi et al.

Communication with people from different cultures is not a new phenomenon.
People have been travelling for centuries, transacting and exchanging culturally and
linguistically. Fast travel, international media and the Internet have made world
communication much more accessible. Communication occurs not only between
people who travel, but also between people of different cultures who live together in the
same spaces such as in the public sphere, economic life, the private life of citizens, and
the educational sphere, locally and internationally. Knowledge of other cultures is of
vital importance in order for communication between people of different cultures to be
effective and in order for all parties to be able to emerge with the same understanding.
To achieve that, both the web developer and the web visitors need to be interculturally
competent, in other words they need to have the “…abilities to understand different
modes of thinking and living … and to reconcile or mediate between different modes
present in any speciﬁc interaction …” [9].
Over the years, some sort of common cyber culture was developed. Aspects such as
netiquette were designed to guide internauts into how to behave online and neticons
accompanied people’s messages. However, as more and more people of diverse lin-
guistic and cultural background cultures used the Internet, cultural misunderstandings
started to occur. This led to the development of approaches towards a web of more
effective intercultural communication. Elements such as language, culture, layout and
design were taken into consideration in this light.
Although English seems to be the most dominant language on the web, more and
more websites are developed in many languages [10]. Wherever English is used, either
as mother tongue or as a lingua franca, and since there is no standard English, every
effort needs to be taken to use a form of English comprehensible to most site visitors
(writing style, short and simple sentences, use of speciﬁc words, idioms, slang, and
turns of phrase, similes and metaphors, that may have different cultural connotation in
another language, etc.). The aims of each site should be to reach as many of its intended
visitors as possible, in the best possible way. This should determine the choice of
language(s). Very often, organisations opt to provide translated versions of their sites.
In such cases, caution needs to be exercised for the message to be mediated appro-
priately, both linguistically and culturally in order to avoid cultural misunderstandings.
According to Schneiderman [11], a website’s interface intermediates between a
system and users, therefore it is important that it accommodates the need of the users
and makes it easy to use. Website user interface needs to take into consideration the
users’ cultural differences [12]. In general, organisations need to ensure sensitive
presence on the Internet. This extends to the website presentation, the site layout and
design, which also send messages of meanings that could be misunderstood. These
include interface, navigation and screen design, images, and colours. According to
Marcus
and
Baumgartner
[13],
“people
from
different
countries/cultures
use
user-interfaces (UIs) in different ways, prefer different graphical layouts, and have
different expectations and patterns in behaviour”.
Cultural misunderstanding in online spaces may be caused by elements such as
reading order; length of words and phrases may cause difﬁculties with graphical
navigation methods and may lead to screen redesign ([16]; as cited in [8]). Images may
Exploring the Multilingual Efﬁciency of Urban Online Spaces
249

also be the source of cultural misunderstanding. Images can have different meaning in
different cultures. Images must be appropriate, clear and non-insulting to their intended
audience [8]. Colour is another aspect that may cause cultural misunderstanding as
different colours have different meanings among cultures as well as within a culture
([14, 15]; as cited in [8]). Site development and management are also important and
need to take into consideration where the audience comes from, locally or interna-
tionally and accommodate their needs as well, and take into consideration other aspects
such as downloading time, and streaming ([16]; as cited in [8]).
Successful multilingualism in online spaces is based on human and technical fac-
tors; in other words, it requires cultural competence and appropriate software solutions.
Parameters such as language, culture, layout and design need to be taken into con-
sideration in order to have effective online intercultural communication. A standard
user interface is and can no longer be used in the design of a website. Cultural
differences are now also being explored. Several studies explored interface designs.
Husmann [17], for example, investigated the localisation of web user interface by
examining the cross-cultural differences in home page design. SD Erişti [18] explored
the cultural factors in web design of 15 university web sites chosen randomly from 11
countries. Cyr and Trevor-Smith [19] investigated the localisation of web design by
comparing German, Japanese, and U.S. website characteristics. Cyr et al. [20] also
carried out a four nation study which addressed differences in preference and per-
ception of website design across cultures.
Intercultural online design entails the manifestation of elements of language, cul-
ture, layout and design. For the purposes of this study, we explored intercultural online
design with an emphasis on the use of language/s in various websites accessed and
utilized by users coming from different cultural backgrounds.

Methodology
As noted earlier, the aim of this study is to create a multiplicity of up-to-date narratives
on the multi/plurilingual realities of the online space of Limassol in terms of provision
of and access to information. Four key spheres were explored related to the public
sphere, education sphere, economic life, and the private lives of citizens. Examples of
online spaces varied in each sphere, but included digital artefacts which illustrated the
multilingual reality of the online spaces of the city, like websites and social networking
pages or communities.
(a) The public sphere included online spaces, such as websites, of the local
municipality/city council, public services (health, transport, tourism) and media
(television, newspapers, digital media). Types of data collected in this sphere
included the websites of the municipalities of Limassol, the website of public
services and local media.
(b) The educational sphere included online spaces, such as websites of public schools
(from day nursery to adult education), vocational schools, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) involved in formal or informal education, independent/
private schools (including bilingual schools), complementary schools (language
academies), and cultural organisations/societies/associations. Types of data
250
A. Parmaxi et al.

collected in this sphere included websites of public and private schools, as well as
complementary schools and cultural organisations.
(c) The economic sphere included online spaces, such as websites of large
local/national companies and multinationals companies based in Limassol,
industries and manufacturing corporations, SMEs, service providers (professional
services), and ﬁnancial transactions’ companies. Types of data collected in this
sphere included information from the website of chambers of commerce and
employers’ associations as well as companies and SMEs based in Limassol.
(d) The private sphere included online spaces, such as websites and communities
within social media, that demonstrated local or city-wide activities (such as fes-
tivals) that were not initiated by the public sphere (although they may have
received public funding) but were organised instead by local community groups,
online spaces of services that are offered by local communities (including vol-
unteer
activities),
local
support
networks
and
religious
activities
and
organisations/structures. Types of data in this sphere included examples of social
network groups and websites of festivals, religious activities, networks of migrant
groups, clubs, sports, and other cultural activities (theatre, music, etc.).
A reporting template was employed in order to facilitate data recording and lan-
guage visibility in online spaces. The template captured concise information from
websites related to (a) language options in online spaces, and (b) access to information
in the different languages in online spaces.
We articulated the following research hypotheses, with regard to multilingualism in
online urban spaces in Limassol:
– Visibility. We hypothesise that some languages are more visible than others in
online urban spaces, and that this visibility/invisibility is meaningful. We hypoth-
esise that sometimes, when languages are visible, the visibility operates at a sym-
bolic level. This symbolism is seen and understood by some, and largely ignored by
others. Languages which are highly visible in online space may not be the lan-
guages in which the various transactions and policies of city life are enacted.
– Challenges/obstacles. We hypothesise that both challenges and obstacles will
appear inhibiting or facilitating communication in online urban spaces.

Findings
This study explored language visibility in online urban spaces in the four spheres
(public sphere, educational sphere, the economic life, and the private life of citizens)
demonstrating the strong presence of Greek, English and Russian. Although the ofﬁcial
languages in Cyprus are Greek and Turkish, English is more visible in online spaces in
Limassol than any other language, whilst Greek dominates in the educational sphere
and English and Russian in the economic life (see Table 1).

5.1
Online Spaces in the Public Sphere
In the public sphere, language provision appears to be balanced between monolingual,
bilingual and multilingual online spaces (see Table 1). Greek, English, Russian and
German are the languages that gain visibility in the online spaces in the public sphere,
yet languages that need to be boosted include Turkish, Arabic, Bulgarian and
Romanian.

The integration of foreign languages in online spaces in the public sphere (e.g. in
the websites of local municipalities) is often made through an information guide
provided by the national authorities in English and Russian. All websites have a Greek
and an English version. However, some important documents are available only in
Greek and in many cases the English version of the website is not working, is under
construction or has a limited amount of information available in English compared to
Greek. Application forms and documents are always available in Greek and in English
in most cases, but no document is provided in Turkish -the second ofﬁcial language of
Cyprus.. Yet, migrants do not only need shortened information, but to be able to access
regulations and information in their mother tongue (or at least in a lingua franca).
On local level, Limassol is making efforts to improve its welcoming policies by
implementing a welcoming policy instrument. The city has published a comprehensive
package of information to aid newly arrived foreign residents. However, the attainment
rate of Limassol’s policy goals is still quite low according to the Intercultural Cities
Index [3].
5.2
Online Spaces in Educational Sphere
While intercultural education is an ofﬁcial aim of the Ministry of Education in Cyprus,
measures to implement it in online spaces are unfavourable with limited information
available in languages other than Greek. Having a vast majority of public schools’
websites being monolingual, de facto excludes migrant children and their parents from
access to important information related to their education. Symbolic use of language in
one public school is provided by having the school’s director’s salutation translated in
6 different languages (Spanish, French, German, Italian, English, Russian). Such
symbolic use of these languages enacts familiarity with the visitor of the website.
Private schools are more sensitive in providing information in more than one languages
-as they follow an English curriculum. A good practice noticed is the provision of
information in different languages in an information pack-instead of providing the
whole translated version of the website. Such a practice provides a cost-efﬁcient way to
facilitate easy access of the majority of information in another language.
Languages other than Greek and English are visible in the educational online
spaces such as French, Russian, Spanish, Chinese and German. Neglected languages
are Arabic, Romanian, Bulgarian, Spanish, Chinese and German, in spite of the large
population of these ethnicities that reside in Limassol. Regarding languages that
deserve a boost in the educational online spaces include English, together with Turkish,
Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Bulgarian and Romanian.
5.3
Online Spaces in Economic Life
Cyprus has always been an attractive migration pole, and labour market conditions are
among the reasons that make migrants decide to settle in Cyprus. With regard to
language visibility in online spaces in economic life, English, Russian and German
sketch the economic linguistic proﬁle of Limassol. The English language is used

253

widely within various private companies and in many industries, such as banking,
ﬁnancial services, legal ﬁrms, tourist organisations, hotel and hospitality enterprises,
and many others. Taking into account the economic proﬁle of the city, English, Ger-
man and Russian are the strongest ﬁnancial partners in Limassol, thus the visibility of
these language is meaningful in terms of their presence in the economy. Remarkably
the multicultural character of Limassol is also formulated by people of Asian or African
origin; however, their languages appear to be neglected and thus less visible within
economic online spaces.
5.4
Online Spaces in the Private Sphere
Various clubs, organisations and associations geared towards the promotion of inter-
culturality and cooperation, human rights, multilingualism and equality exist in
Limassol. Some examples of such institutions are: the Filipino Overseas Contract
Workers Association of Limassol, the Cyprus-Bulgaria Business Association, the
Association of Bulgarians in Cyprus, the Association of Russian-speaking Residents of
Cyprus, the The Middle East Council of Churches, the Association of Recognised
Refugees in Cyprus, the Bi-communal Community Centre in Limassol, etc. In these
online spaces, English is dominant as these associations bring together migrants from
different countries and follow the lingua franca approach for promoting their activities.
Less visible languages in the online spaces in the private sphere are Arabic, Bulgarian,
Romanian, Turkish, Sri Lankan, Vietnamese, Chinese, Polish, Hungarian, German,
French, Slovakian and Serbian. Languages that need to be boosted, are Turkish (as
ofﬁcial and equal state language), Bulgarian, Romanian, Roma, and Arabic.

Discussion
Limassol is a city of increasing inward migration receiving in the last years many
immigrants of diverse cultural, linguistic and economic background. This unprece-
dented change in the demographic character of the city has happened in a short span of
time and has found the people and authorities unprepared to deal with it. Although
online spaces welcome visitors from several different cultural and linguistic back-
grounds, many of these spaces only represent the dominant Greek language, thus not
being able to cater for the needs of culturally diverse visitors.
With regard to the languages’ visibility, our primary hypothesis that some lan-
guages are more visible than others in online spaces, and that this visibility/invisibility
is meaningful has been conﬁrmed. Greek and English appear to be the most visible
languages; however, this does not reﬂect the overall linguistic mosaic of online spaces
Limassol. In general, the wide use of English – being an international dominant lan-
guage - and the neglect of other languages is one of the key themes that has emerged.
English is an effective way of handling overall communication and information pro-
vision in online spaces; on the other hand, it is perceived as a danger of national
languages extinction. Moreover, Russian emerged as the most visible language in the
254
A. Parmaxi et al.

economic sphere. Therefore, we could mention that certain languages have established
themselves and gained visibility based on their ﬁnancial strength in the city.
Our second hypothesis relates to challenges and opportunities in language provi-
sion in online urban spaces. Online urban spaces demonstrate multiple ways of lin-
guistic diversity, either by translating all contents of the page in more than one
language, by providing an information pack with the majority of the content in several
languages or by demonstrating symbolic use of language.

Conclusion
Through the analysis of the online urban spaces of Limassol, various suggestions have
emerged. In general, online urban spaces need to adopt a more pluralistic perspective.
To achieve this, online urban spaces need to reassess the needs of their visitors and
provide a broader linguistic support in terms of access to information. Moreover, the
city needs to explore the efﬁciency of performance of online urban spaces towards
migrant citizens.
Designers may adopt cost-effective ways to involve the cultural and linguistic
context in the design of their artifacts. A cost effective way for supporting linguistic
diversity is to provide an information pack with the whole component of the website,
and thus facilitate their visitors’ access to information. Providing the opportunity to
visitors to understand that the developer catered for their needs can be an important step
for fostering their engagement on the website.
Limassol’s linguistic support at the level of governance or policy is overall limited.
A multilingual online locus needs to make an effort to accommodate its diverse citi-
zens. The actions and initiatives to be taken include assessment of online visitors’
needs and linguistic background and a vision in accommodating -even at a symbolic
level- the needs of multilingual citizens. As noted by Bourges-Waldegg & Scrivener
[21], a central issue in cross-cultural HCI is representations and meaning mediate
action. Designing and sharing an online locus that intends to be shared by culturally
diverse users needs to entail the cultural diverse needs of its users, in terms of culture
and language provision.

Limitations
This study sketches multilingualism in Limassol in online urban spaces by exploring a
substantial number of online spaces in four key spheres. This study does not provide a
holistic understanding of all cultural aspects in online spaces in the city of Limassol.
The intention was to bring to the surface current aspects of handling language barriers
in online spaces. The data of this study is available to anyone that may be interested to
conduct a further research on the topic. The results of the current study are limited to
the particular online spaces; yet they may reﬂect both present and future trends of
multilingualism in terms of provision of and access to information in online spaces.

Introduction
This paper describes how aﬀective engineering approaches contribute to urban design
functions and methods from the viewpoint of street and urban landscape design. Inte‐
gration and diversity are important for street pattern structures and urban landscapes.
The space syntax theory espoused by Hillier [1] shows integration of streets in London,
Venice, Detroit, etc. Psarra [2] indicates that Venice is a city with locally and globally
balanced combinations of street patterns based on the space syntax method. The street
patterns in Venice look complicated, indicating that it would be easy to become lost. In
the center of Detroit, street integration is unbalanced, causing people to leave this area
and move to the suburbs.
Physical street structures diﬀer in terms of balance for local and global integration.
An orderly balance of private and public streets and urban landscape design is quite
important. Japan faces many problems in street and urban landscape design that must
be solved. Especially, the two types of individualism that diﬀerentiate English and
Japanese cultures inﬂuence urban landscape design. The next chapter provides examples
of landscape diﬀerences between England and Japan. I introduce Symbiosis Commu‐
nicator for Advanced and Preserved Environment (SCAPE), an innovation of Kansei
information technology [3–5], to promote resident participation for an orderly urban
landscape design. I think that balance and order play important roles in urban design.

English Individualism Versus Japanese Individualism
The prominent diﬀerence in urban landscapes in England and Japan pertains to the order
of streets. English urban designs are based on regulations concerning building height
and setback space width, so each street is characterized by uniformity in these areas.
Regulations ensure that the skylines in England are either straight or curved (Fig. 1).
Urban landscape design in England is based on maintaining order. On the other hand,
there are some regulations in Japan, but building heights and widths of setback space
are not constant except in some new towns. Therefore, skylines are typically not linear
or curved in Japan (Fig. 1). Urban landscape design in Japan is based on disorder.
Fig. 1. Urban landscapes in England and Japan
In terms of historical landscape scenes, buildings in London are generally older than
in Tokyo. Historical buildings in Tokyo are frequently destroyed and replaced with high-
rise oﬃce and residential buildings. However, there are a few historical towns in Tokyo,
such as Asakusa.
What are the reasons for the visual diﬀerences between Tokyo and London? I
attribute the diﬀerences to the various concepts regarding public and private land use.
For example, the address system in the UK is based on streets (lines), whereas the address
system in Japan is based on land (areas). Land in Japan is generally owned by individuals
and land developers, so it is possible that a low-rise housing area is situated next to a
towering residential building in Chiba New Town, Japan, for example. Land in the UK
used to be state-owned but is now privately owned, whereas most land in Japan is
privately owned. Urban landscape design in the UK is based on a public order, in contrast
to the private order that characterizes Japan’s urban landscape, so there are stronger
regulations for buildings in the UK than in Japan.
In terms of social behaviors, the Japanese work hard and tend to devote themselves
to work rather than to their personal lives, whereas the English reverse these priorities.
Moreover, the order when writing name and address in England is ﬁrst name, surname,
house number, street, town, and country; in Japan, the address begins with the country
and is followed by the prefecture, house number, surname, and ﬁrst name. The address
format supports the observation that priority is given to the private or personal over the
public in the UK, whereas the public viewpoint is more important in Japan. Japanese
people strive for public order, but the English focus on their private lives. English
behavior is more private, though the English urban landscape has a public order that is
homogeneous. The Japanese behave publicly, but the Japanese urban landscape has no
258
T. Shibata

order and is heterogeneous. It would seem that Japanese people are quite selﬁsh rather
than individualistic in urban landscape designs.
There is a clear diﬀerence and contradiction between behaviors and urban landscape
designs in Japan. I think that the Japanese have misunderstand the concept of individu‐
alism, which aﬀects urban design strongly. The Japanese novelist Soseki Natsume, who
visited London, indicated that the concept of individualism is perceived diﬀerently in
the UK than it is in Japan [6].

Information and Environment Versus Information Environment
Figure 2 shows the relationship between information and the environment and the corre‐
sponding link to the body. Information from media includes language, images, movies,
and music. Language is representative. For example, no apples are identical, but
everyone recognizes an apple as an apple. Language treats diﬀerent apples homogene‐
ously. Invariant features play an important role in recognizing objects in our brains to
name objects. The information can be homogeneous, though the environment seems to
be heterogeneous. The environment is twofold: natural and built (artiﬁcial). Natural
environments are neither constant nor homogeneous because climates change based on
daytime and nighttime and the four seasons. Thus, there is no identical natural environ‐
ment in the world. However, a built environment controls temperature and brightness
for constancy. The homogeneous structure of the built environment is similar to the
structure of information. Diﬀerences between information and the environment involve
(1) movability, (2) independence of places, and (3) existing entity (or weight), as Fig. 2
shows. The body looks homogeneous but is heterogeneous.
Fig. 2. Relationship between information and the environment
Homogeneously built environments in Japan include buildings, shopping centers,
and convenience stores. Figure 3 refers to a tower residential block in Kunitachi, Tokyo.
Residents there protect the street landscape design with straight skylines and trees,
although a land developer built the tower block similarly to other buildings that had
already been constructed. Built environments become homogeneous, as there are
numerous 7-Eleven retail shops and AEON shopping malls in Japan. Figure 4 shows a
natural landscape with a heterogeneous environment. Shirakawago, a village surrounded
Bridging Personal Adaptations to Urban Landscape Design
259

and segregated by mountains, has a beautiful landscape with wooden detached houses
featuring steep roofs. The landscape shown in Fig. 4 is opposite that shown in Fig. 3. A
built environment should be in harmony with the surrounding regional environment,
and people must protect and maintain their landscape. Therefore, resident participation
plays an important role, and residents in Kunitachi and Shirakawago maintain their
environment by themselves. The Japanese tend not to care for the public landscape order,
as I talked about the Japanese selﬁshness.

Interface Design
Figure 5 shows the previous and current interface environment for accessing and
displaying information. Figure 5a shows an environment in which, for example, people
go to a ﬁxed telephone to communicate with others or to a desktop PC to input infor‐
mation via the keyboard. A body has to go to the interface to input and receive infor‐
mation. On the other hand, Fig. 5b shows an environment in which people do not have
to go to an interface; the environment or space can be an interface (i.e., ambient envi‐
ronment). A smartphone and Kinect (Microsoft) are user interfaces for accessing data
and information. The interface is independent of place, and it is wearable. There is no
boundary between the body and the interface, as Fig. 5b shows.

Interface Supporting Personal Design
I refer to “human media”—including Kansei media, knowledge media, and augmented
media, as Fig. 6 shows. Kansei media are based on personal adaptation models devel‐
oped through deep learning methods [4, 5]. For example, street landscapes taken on a
user’s smartphone are evaluated with a personal aﬀective model automatically, as
Fig. 7a shows. It means that the evaluations are diﬀerent for individuals. Knowledge
media are based on collections of multimedia databases that are structured by models.
Augmented media are tools to represent 3D objects in the real world. The three media
technologies are integrated as an interface to support personal design. Creations by
individuals are shared and distributed to create new values and services.

SCAPE System
SCAPE stands for Symbiosis Communicator for Advanced and Preserved Environment;
it integrates Kansei knowledge with augmented media technology. The basic idea is (1)
to model residents or designers’ Kansei, and (2) to construct the relationship between
subjective responses to multimedia data and feature descriptors of multi-modal data such
as images, 3D models, sounds, etc. The system is used to construct buildings, street
furniture, and textures for pavement; professionals’ and designers’ models are included
Bridging Personal Adaptations to Urban Landscape Design
261

in the database. The database contains knowledge and information from various special‐
ists. Furthermore, SCAPE is used (3) to build virtual objects, such as objects designed
on real sites using augmented reality technology. It is easy for a resident to understand
and share the images once they are retrieved via SCAPE. If the system is used by resi‐
dents, more people will become interested in urban landscapes, thus fostering greater
attention on maintaining and improving the natural and built environment. Resident
participation can be promoted actively.
Figure 7 shows the interface of the SCAPE system. When photographing any kind
of street landscape with any kind of camera, as Fig. 7a shows, the system automatically
estimates the landscape and output by Kansei or aﬀective rankings according to a
personal Kansei model. Figure 7b indicates 3D light retrieval results harmonized in the
target 2D street image. There are 2D and 3D models with features for colors, shapes,
and Kansei or aﬀective rankings. Figure 7c indicates virtual 3D light object alignment
on the real site using augmented reality technology [7]. The advantages of SCAPE are
the selection of various types of data from multimedia databases and the simulation of
any kind of 3D data at the real site.

Resident Participation in Landscape Design Project
I think resident participation will be a key point for keeping and protecting urban land‐
scapes because residents can create their environment actively and independently.
However, residents generally have no knowledge about environmental design. Since
they do, however, have the desire to protect the environment, SCAPE would be an
eﬀective tool to support them. Thus, they would not have to rely on architects and
designers.
A resident group in Japan —Kobayashi Sumiyoi Machidukuri Group—designed a
small pavilion in a Dosaku mound tomb area in Inzai, Chiba. Nobody has cared for this
area except the resident group. According to questionnaires, people requested a small
pavilion as a rest area so that they could reﬂect on the beautiful surrounding, which
include woodlands and cherry blossoms. The project is supported by the resident group,
students from Tokyo Denki University, and an architect. We carried out several work‐
shops to design the pavilion, as Fig. 8a shows. We used SCAPE to check the 3D CAD
model of the pavilion (Fig. 8b). Residents were able to imagine and explore many kinds
of pavilions. Figure 9 shows the ﬁnal pavilion design agreed upon by the resident group.
Local governments or developers design urban landscapes to keep them clean and
follow design guidelines that meet local regulations. Typically, local governments or
developers determine urban landscape designs. Moreover, residents usually have no
knowledge of the designs and no tools for presenting their desired images. However,
many projects involving resident participation in urban landscape design are underway
in Japan. SCAPE could be a useful tool to help them design their towns and cities inde‐
pendently.

Conclusions
SCAPE will support town and city designs by individuals and residents in local and
regional areas. Designs are shared through the Internet to unite residents and maintain
a sustainable society. Therefore, we can promote diversity and heterogeneous environ‐
ments and societies throughout the world. However, there is currently more disorder in
urban design than before in Japan because of selﬁshness by landowners. We need to
accept the diversity of towns and ensure order in town designs. I believe that SCAPE
will promote resident participation in designing landscapes that reﬂect diversity.

Abstract. There are many researches show that product have personiﬁed per-
sonality, in recently years, the cultural & creative products has emphasize the
direction of personalized merchandise to cater demand from consumer and
thereby satisﬁed the maverick consumer which have distinctive psychological
needs. The purpose of this study is investigated the cognition of cultural &
creative products are identical between the consumer who have different per-
sonality traits and learn more about the consumer preferences and purchase
intentions. The research process of this paper is divided into four phases. First,
according to the literature reviews deﬁne the correspondence between “Person-
ality”, “Personalized Product” and “Consumer Perception” as ﬁrst phase. In
second phase, this paper collected the winner’s works of cultural & creative
award during 2010 to 2015 as test sample to implement expert pre-questionnaire.
Researcher reconstructed next phase questionnaire through comparison the
“Personalized Product” awareness from expert into formal survey. During the
third phase, each examinee will answer Professional DynaMetric Programs and
ﬁnish “Personalized Product and Purchase Intention questionnaire”. The fourth
phase will be data analysis and result. This study is going to verify the rela-
tionship between “Personality of Cultural & Creative Product” and “Consumer
Perception”, and discuss the correlation of “Consumer Perception” and “Per-
sonality”. Above factor will be affected the consumer purchase intention or not.
This result would be provided to product planner, designer or marketing for
reference.

personal traits to products, including positive and negative ones, that is, personiﬁcation
of products (Sirgy 1982). The literature of emotion research for product design
assessment also underscores product identity. The ergonomics designers also explore
how different consumers correlate personality with product identity, and made products
become unique and interesting, for instance, hinting the gender of products (McDonagh
and Weightman 2003). Whether product identity matches with the designer concept
eventually hinges on the cognitive foundation of consumers and further generates
purchasing willingness. Kotler and Kotler (2000) thinks that “cognition” refers to the
process of generating internal signiﬁcance from outside information of personal
selection, organization and interpretation. “Cognition” is being given environmental
signiﬁcance, a process of gaining impression through sensing and organizational
interpretation (Robbins 2000). This shows cognition is being inﬂuenced by external
situations in different environments and also inﬂuenced by the personal traits and
internal factors of the consumer.
In developing a new product, the creative designer shall focus on aesthetics and
emotional factors (Jordan 2000). Concomitantly, it is essential to further the relation
between product identity and consumer cognition, and act as reference for creations by
future designers. Cognitive research of product identity involves too many uncon-
trollable external environmental cognitive factors and made the interference variable to
research too complicated. Henceforth, this study uses the controllable personality of
consumers as the variable for product identity and consumer cognition, and hopes to
comprehend the extent of inﬂuence between the two. This is planned for next stage
research foundation.

Literature Review
2.1
Cultural and Creative Product and Product Identity Study
The rise of global cultural and creative industries is the result of highlighting the culture
industry. Under this mindset, as well as under the inﬂuence of the consumption process
of modern culture, more importance is attached to developing the spiritual value of
products, thereby developing toward artistic creations of a ﬁne culture (Chen 2009).
Thus, product design no longer stresses on function, rather it diversiﬁes toward
attraction of consumers with feeling for the product. Moreover, each product is formed
by a set of attributes such as outward appearance, brand, function and after-sales
service and so on, which formed a part of the product attributes (Wenxian and Qinfu
2000). In the current consumer society, the aesthetical experience of cultural and
creative products will play a considerable role.
Norman (2004) thinks that utilizing emotion for product design allows stirring up
the positive emotions of people with its attraction, therefore, such products will be
more useful. Rahman (2012) also mentions that the generation of aesthetics may be
deﬁned as physical stimulus, that is, experience obtained through vision or feeling. It is
thus understood that study of aforementioned literary documents, the cultural and
creative products attach more importance to aesthetics and emotion than other products.

A Study of Relationship Between Personality and Product Identity
Regarding study of cognitive inﬂuence from consumption behavior, scholars have
found that personality can have signiﬁcant direct inﬂuence if the product type has a
high level of linking symbolically, and the product brand personality matches with
consumer personality (Aaker 1997). Study points out that in using certain brand pro-
duct, consumer personality would engage in dialogue and communication with certain
brand, share and co-construct its symbolic value and extend its self-conception.
A study by Zang (2008) found that throughout the process of system recommendation
by consumer, latter’s degree of acceptance for system recommended products differs
from personality. Henceforth, a host of studies show that different personality can have
signiﬁcant correlation with consumer cognitive judgment. This study hopes to com-
prehend the degree of correlation between product identity and consumer cognition.
H2: Signiﬁcant correlation between cultural and creative product identity and
consumer cognition.
2.3
Study of Consumer Personality and Product Purchasing Willingness
In purchasing a product the consumer chooses a product and image matching his or her
personality. Sometimes, the consumer chooses not to buy a product even though he or
she likes the shape of the product but dislikes its symbolic signiﬁcance. (Creusen and
Schoormans 2005). Henceforth, prior to purchasing the consumer would try to know
the outward appearance or content of the product, and the decisive factors in cognitive
psychology are as follows: (1) Past experience, (2) Personal need and wish, (3) Current
personal physiological and psychological situation, (4) Personal situation, (5) Charac-
teristics of the observed object, (Zhong 1990). (Norman and Ortony 2006) also pro-
posed that the human information processing system may be divided into the
“cognitive” system and the “emotional” system. Both differ in function: The emotion
system controls judgment and swiftly makes efﬁcient positive and negative appraisal
toward the environment while the cognitive system interprets and endows meanings to
external happenings. A host of studies by scholars show that consumers have com-
paratively positive appraisal for products similar to his or her personality.
H3: Signiﬁcant correlation between consumer cognition and purchasing willingness.
H4: The extent of matching the product and consumer personality will positively
affect his or her purchasing willingness.

Methodologies
3.1
Study Flow
This study uses the award-winning articles of 2010–2015 Creative Expo Taiwan as
specimen. First, two experts carried out classiﬁcation of personality for all articles, and
then picked out articles of similar classiﬁcation and used as specimens for expert
questionnaire of the ﬁrst stage. After analysis, a stage 2 questionnaire will be carried
out on consumer personality and consumer cognition, and ﬁnd out the correlation
between product identity and consumer cognition, as well as the inﬂuence on product
identity and consumer cognition from ﬁve major personalities. Eventually, survey will
be carried out on consumer purchasing willingness. The study ﬂow is shown in Fig. 1:
The study ﬂow and steps are described below in four stages:
1. First stage: Find out the structure and special characteristics of cultural and creative
products, consumer personality, and relevant theories of consumer cognition
through collection and exploration of relevant literary data, and consequently ﬁnd
out whether such would affect consumer purchasing willingness.
2. Second stage: Take the award-winning articles for 2010–2015 as testing specimens,
and prepare questionnaire by two experts matching the specimen personality, then
carry out a preliminary expert questionnaire, and eventually compare expert’s
cognition for product identity, and again screen out, sort and design the question-
naire for the next stage.

Result and Discussion
A total of 115 people took part in the PDP aptitude test during the consumer ques-
tionnaire stage. Valid questionnaires are 102 and the ﬁnal statistics are: Koala (32
people), Owl (21 people), Peacock (25 people), Tiger (13 people), Chameleon (11
people), and the gender distribution is shown in the Figure below:
In the ﬁve sub-assumptions of H1, we found that t-values are greater than 2. Under
95 % of conﬁdence level, product identity of the ﬁve creative products are signiﬁcantly
higher than the median value. In other words, these ﬁve creative products have per-
sonality traits (Fig. 2).
H2:Signiﬁcant correlation between creative product identity and consumer
cognition.
Testing result shown in Table 3 shows that comparing to other low proﬁle creative
products with stable, peaceful, elegant and kind quality, only the lively creative product
can comparatively highlight personality with ease (Table 4).

Conclusion and Recommendation
The questionnaire analysis shows that the four assumptions of this study have signif-
icant correlation and testiﬁes to the personality of creative products and general mer-
chandise, and different personalities stimulate purchasing willingness if different
personalities match with product identity. This study draws following conclusions:
1. Experts have screened out classiﬁed creative products using personality traits, and
picked out ﬁve representative products with different identities. Such products will
form the next stage questionnaire. Consequently, through questionnaire analysis
statistics, we can see that the ﬁve creative products boast different identities and
testify to the personality of creative products with general merchandise.
2. Judged by analysis of the ﬁve products with different identities, those creative
products with “lively” personality are more pronounced in personality trait, com-
paring to the comparatively low-proﬁle creative products which are stable, peaceful,
elegant and kind.
3. Apparently, the degree of matching between creative products and consumer per-
sonality is an important factor in consumer purchasing willingness. It is a critical
and vital factor in knowing consumer personality and designing products with
identity for the market.
4. This study only uses pictures of creative products and personality traits for
description in a bid to testify the correlation between creative product and per-
sonality with purchasing willingness. Despite progress in preliminary study, there is
a plethora of factors to consider throughout the entire purchasing process of creative
products. This will be the future direction of study.
In recent years, creative products sprouted up on the market. Nevertheless, only very
few products have become popular. How to satisfy consumer psychology will be an
issue for most designers aspiring to comprehend. Conclusions of this study found close
correlation between different consumer personalities and identities of creative products
and purchasing willingness. This is worth for further study. In the future, this study will
further explore how the intrinsic emotion of creative products, outward appearance and
function could affect personalities of different consumers. This will beneﬁt future
product planning by designers and provide reference to consumer in buying products
with matching identities.

Introduction
Cultural development is the source of life of a country and a nation. Technology and
innovation, the important engine of cultural development, is the source of cultural inno‐
vation. Cultural heritage, which condenses the quintessence of national culture and
shows the spirit of the regional people, is a symbol of national culture and plays a key
role in the inheritance of regional culture. As one of the important components of the
material and cultural heritage in China, traditional Chinese furniture is a wonderful work
among world classical furniture system, especially the furnitures in the Ming and Qing
Dynasties. Traditional Chinese furniture with rich varieties, exquisite material, excellent
workmanship, beautiful shape and delicate patterns is an important component of the
Chinese traditional culture, which carries abundant information about ancient Chinese,
such as lifestyle, ideology and value orientation etc.
However, foreign culture is having an impact on the national culture in the era of
globalization. The relationship between culture and the development of science and
technology is inseparable [1]. With the development of Internet, cloud computing, big
data and 4G, the popularity and prosperity of mobile intelligent equipment and public
resources platform construction, it should be taken into consideration that how to display

the traditional culture confronted with the advanced science and technology [2]. There
is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence about the possession quantity of cultural knowledge in diﬀerent
groups of people, which brings challenges and opportunities to the protection and
heritage of cultural heritage. There are also problems in the display and dissemination
of traditional Chinese furniture culture: (1) the methods of gathering information about
traditional Chinese furniture are single, mainly from related research institutes and
museums; (2) the contents displayed are single, and the gap among the audience groups
of traditional Chinese furniture culture is large while most of the display of the content
currently is an explanation of physical furniture with a lack of systematic display of
furniture culture relevant. (3) the form of display and dissemination of traditional
Chinese furniture culture is single. Most physical furniture now is stored in museums
or possessed by collectors. As a result, t is diﬃcult for people who have an appetite for
furniture around the world to learn deeply about the characteristics and cultural conno‐
tation of the furniture. Meanwhile, it is a barrier to spreading the Chinese traditional
culture. (4) the display form of physical furniture is single. People usually get familiar
with furniture in a static view so that there is a lack of an interaction between audience
and the traditional furniture. It is more diﬃcult to arouse people’s enthusiasm for the
traditional furniture culture.
Based on the Above Problems, This Paper Launches the Following Research:
Study on the display form of traditional Chinese furniture culture under the background
of digital medium and technology; Study on characteristics and category of audience
groups of traditional Chinese furniture culture; Study on the model of acquisition,
display and dissemination of Information about traditional Chinese furniture culture.
The Purpose and Signiﬁcance of This Study: By sorting out the culture of traditional
Chinese furniture and carrying out stratiﬁcation research on the user groups, to dig the
needs of diﬀerent groups of the user towards traditional Chinese furniture and establish
user demand model. The interactive digitization form is introduced into the display and
dissemination of furniture culture. Establish the display and dissemination model of the
culture of traditional Chinese furniture and put forward the application methods and
paths. The digitization medium for display and dissemination provides a good platform
for traditional Chinese furniture. Therefore, the interactive digitization form, which is
funny and vivid, is adopted to display and disseminate classical Chinese furniture. It
will arouse people’s interest in Chinese traditional culture, and make people who have
an appetite for traditional Chinese furniture around the world get acquainted with the
culture of classical Chinese furniture conveniently and quickly. In this way, the culture
of traditional Chinese furniture will be inherited and spread in a “live” status.

Background
2.1
The Cultural Connotation of Traditional Chinese Furniture
Development: Traditional Chinese furniture has a long history, dating back to the
seventeenth Century BC. After thousands of years of development, Chinese furniture
276
X. Sun and C. Li

always has a unique national style. Chinese furniture has always been dominated by
wooden products. And furniture modeling is aﬀected by architectural modeling so that
furniture modeling is a transformation of constructions. From the point of view of the
history of the furniture development, due to the changes in people’s living habits, tradi‐
tional Chinese furniture experiences the process from the low-type furniture which needs
kneeling on the ground from Shang and Zhou dynasty to Qin and Han dynasty, the
sitting-on furniture in transition period from Wei Jin dynasty to Sui Tang dynasty, to
the sitting-on furniture high-type furniture of the Northern Song Dynasty. The traditional
Chinese furniture reached a historical peak in the Ming Dynasty. Whether the varieties
of furniture or the making technology, furniture workshops and specialized market is in
the heyday of the development of China’s ancient furniture. The furniture in Ming
Dynasty creates a superb furniture production technology and exquisite art form [3]. As
a whole, Chinese antique furniture has experienced the process of changing from low
to high with the furniture varieties becoming richer and production process level grad‐
ually increasing. It forms a relatively perfect furniture system.
Cultural Connotation: From a certain sense, the furniture is a cultural integration. It
marks the level of the social productivity of a country or region in a certain historical
period. It is the epitome of a certain lifestyle and the manifestation of a culture. On the
basis of its rich cultural and historical tradition, traditional Chinese furniture is changing
all aspects of human culture constantly and profoundly. Traditional Chinese furniture
culture is inﬂuenced by ritual system (it reﬂects the political and social attributes of
furniture), folk customs (such as festival and wedding feast customs), religion (for
example, a large number of high-type furniture of Buddhist Tianzhu inﬂow into China),
ancient literati, painting, architecture, hundred worker skills, society and other multiple
factors. When ultimately reﬂected in traditional Chinese furniture culture, it is mainly
manifested in three aspects: furniture technology culture, furniture humanistic culture
and furniture art culture (Fig. 1) [4]. Taking the furniture of Ming Dynasty which is in
its heyday as an example: in furniture technology culture, it appears to be using exquisite
timber and paying attention to the natural texture fully reﬂecting the wood’s natural
color and texture, with scientiﬁc structures and sophisticated tenon and mortise; in
furniture humanistic culture, it appears to be embodied for decorative patterns. The
patterns must be intentional and the intention must be auspicious. The dimension of the
furniture is suitable for the human body engineering; in furniture art culture, it appears
to be decorated moderately. It is a combination of decoration and structure. And the
modeling is minimalist with moderate proportion.
Features: The culture of traditional Chinese furniture is regional, professional,
multiple and contemporary. Inﬂuenced by Chinese ancient philosophy, traditional
Chinese furniture Itself is the product of the unity of heaven and man and the material
carrier of its cultural spirit, whether in furniture design, or in furniture fabrication.
Digital Display and Transmission of the Culture

2.2
The Medium and the Technology of Digital Display:
As a new research method, digitization is introduced to the research on traditional furni‐
ture. The medium of digitization, which is of transmissible, Interactive and interesting,
brings a new experience for the display and dissemination of traditional Chinese furni‐
ture culture. At present, there are the following medium and technology:
PC Network Platform: The medium of digital display, which is based on PC network
platform, is one of the most traditional medium forms in the digital display medium.
And it is also the earliest form of application and popularization. Based on the personal
computer terminal, through the Internet online browsing furniture cultural heritage
resources, digital resources can be presented via images, video, music and other imaging
methods. In the meanwhile, with the development of computer technology, all kinds of
interactive virtual display also tend to be more popular.
Mobile Smart Devices: The popularity of smart mobile devices has been gradually
changed the people’s life. Beginning from smart phones, the emergence of mobile smart
devices such as smart watches, smart bracelet, smart wearable device, have a great
impact on human lifestyle. As a kind of new medium of the display and dissemination
of the traditional furniture culture heritage, digital display medium, based on mobile
smart devices, has a wider application platform and audience groups. As the medium of
digital display, the application of mobile smart devices is an important channel for the
display and dissemination of furniture culture.
Public Platforms: Traditional medium such as museums, art galleries, shopping
centers and other public cultural platforms, also provides a good platform for the
278
X. Sun and C. Li

dissemination of furniture culture relying on the digital construction. Taking the museum
as an example, digital means are integrated into the design of exhibits display to enhance
the audience’s sense of participation by means of holographic projection, touch screen,
3D images, sensing devices and other interactive devices. And it can achieve the simul‐
taneous transmission and share of images and information through the Internet.
Virtual Reality Technology: As a kind of digital technology, it is widely used in many
ﬁelds in recent years. With the aid of the computer simulation, Virtual Reality could
create a virtual environment so that the user will be immersed in the virtual environment
and produce the feeling of be personally on the scene. Through speciﬁc operation, the
user can be able to interact with the multi-dimensional information environment, acquire
knowledge, improve awareness and germinate ideas. By means of Virtual Reality tech‐
nology, the research on traditional Chinese furniture is mainly used in the demonstration
of the products and virtual space of classical furniture.
The diversity of digital medium and technology provides a new opportunity for
cultural display. The digital display medium of traditional furniture cultural heritage,
from PC to mobile smart device application and from the social network to the public
cultural platform, achieves comprehensive and three-dimensional digitization informa‐
tion transmission and interactive experience with multiple sensory involvement
including vision, hearing and touch. In the meanwhile, digitization plays an active role
in promoting the protection and inheritance of cultural heritage.

Research Method
Based on the survey and analysis of user groups whom the display and dissemination
of traditional Chinese furniture culture is intended for, this study establish three types
of user groups according to the knowledge level and attention degree of traditional
Chinese furniture culture. In addition, this study establishes Character Model to guide
the follow-up study so as to determine the models and ways of information collection
and digital display and dissemination of traditional Chinese furniture culture.
The research process is divided into three steps: Firstly, start the start research and
screening the information obtained to organize and form forceful user information via
Interview method. Secondly, summarize similar user information and establish three
types of user groups. Finally, establish Character Role Models for the three types of user
group respectively.
3.1
Preliminary User Investigation
Preliminary user investigation is divided into three steps: user selection, user interview
and an arrangement of interview information.
User Selection: Nanjing is an ancient capital of China, which has a profound cultural
heritage. There are many universities, large museums and communities in Nanjing.
Therefore, the study is carried out in Nanjing, China. We visited University (Nanjing
University of science and technology, Nanjing Forestry University), museums

279

(Nanjing Museum) and communities (Xiaolingwei community, Vanke community and
other four residential community. Finally, 30 Chinese users is chosen as the ﬁnal inter‐
viewees, including collectors, college students, primary and secondary school students,
retired workers, white-collar workers and etc. These users use smart phones and have a
certain cultural knowledge base.
The Way of Interview: This study learns the users’ real thoughts and experience
demands by asking questions. In the interview, the combination of structured interview
and non-structured interview is adopted. At the same time, part of the users’ studios and
living environments is observed to understand the users’ behaviors and lifestyle (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2. The way of interview
Interview Contents: Determine the Interview contents according to the subject. The
contents are divided into general questions and deep questions depending on content
level. Firstly, by means of Interview with basic questions, to learn the recognition degree
of traditional Chinese furniture culture among users. Secondly, by means of Interview
with deep questions, to dig opportunities for the display and dissemination of Chinese
furniture culture.
Sort Out the Interview Information: Weigh and analyses the users’ problems system‐
atically. In the meanwhile, label and classify all of the data according to user viewpoint,
motivation, demographics and other factors.
Find the Common Mode: Seize important labels of the users and describe these labels
in categories.
3.2
The Analysis of User Roles
Through the preliminary user investigation, a lot of user information is gained, including
attention degree, loyalty, and awareness degree of diﬀerent user groups towards tradi‐
tional Chinese furniture culture. After ordering and summing up the data of 30 users,
diﬀerent factors were typical combined. In the meanwhile, transform user demands into
characters and establish three types of user groups from top to bottom according to the
user’s academic background, interest, motivation, loyalty and other important factors
(Fig. 3).

members are people with have higher educational level and social status, including
collectors, scholars in the direction of the furniture, researcher on traditional Chinese
furniture and etc. They are in possession of abundant professional knowledge and have
great enthusiasm for traditional Chinese furniture and its culture based on a deep research
on traditional Chinese furniture. And they are willing to devote time and energy to the
study and dissemination of Chinese traditional furniture culture. The dominant demands
of this kind of user groups consist of the demand for culture dissemination, the demand
for knowledge sharing, and the demand for respect.
“The Type of Explore Learning”—— Intermediate Knowledge Users: Students
with a certain knowledge of Chinese traditional culture, white collars and people from
all walks who love Chinese traditional culture. They have a bachelor degree or above
with good cultural quality and eager to learn the related knowledge of traditional Chinese
furniture culture. In addition, they are willing to share the spread furniture culture. The
dominant demands of this kind of user groups consist of the demand for exploring, the
demand for knowledge exchange and the demand for learning.
“The Type of Hobby and Experience”—— The Primary Knowledge Users: This
type of user groups refer to people who grasp a certain cultural knowledge but don’t
understand the culture of Chinese traditional furniture. For these people, they are willing
to learn to accept the traditional culture. These users mainly include primary and secon‐
dary school students, college students and the following education adults, parts of the
elderly and other user groups. The dominant demands of this kind of user groups consist
of the demand of knowledge experience and the demand for information.

Establish the User Model
The establishment of the User Model is to refer to transform the user in the future into
lifelike people and build the future product system model for these real “people” [5].
By creating User Model, we can reduce the subjective assumptions and understand what
the real users’ demands are so as to learn how to serve for diﬀerent types of users better.
Therefore, based on the previous research, the elements are abstracted and the above
three types of user groups are built into Character Model Cards respectively. In the
meanwhile, the user demands above are introduced into the User Model. Model Cards
282

consist of User proﬁle, the attitude towards traditional culture, the way of knowledge
acquisition, lifestyle and etc. (Fig. 4). Model Cards are the basis for the subsequent
design model.

Results and Discussions
4.1
Establish Digital Display and Dissemination Model of Traditional Chinese
Furniture Culture
According to the “user-centered” design concept, pay attention to the object of display and
dissemination of traditional Chinese furniture culture, that is, “the user”. And taking it as the
center, to build the model of display and dissemination of traditional Chinese furniture
culture, combined with the theory of knowledge dissemination. “The dissemination of
knowledge” is such a process of social activities: in the specific social environment, a part
of the social members spread the specific knowledge and information to another part of the
members of the society by means of specific media of knowledge dissemination, and they
look forward to receiving the desired effect of the spread [6]. After being created by
members of human society through social practice and creative thinking, the knowledge and
information of traditional furniture culture is obtained selectively by those members of
society who have the awareness of knowledge dissemination and the duty of social knowl‐
edge dissemination. After they release and encoding code, it becomes culture knowledge
products that are available for dissemination. Then in specific social backgrounds and

283

environments, it will be spread to another part of society members through the specific
dissemination medium of traditional furniture culture knowledge. That is the process of
knowledge dissemination of traditional furniture culture. In brief, the process of digital
dissemination of traditional Chinese furniture culture is: information acquisition of tradi‐
tional furniture culture, information share of traditional furniture culture and information
feedback of traditional furniture culture (Fig. 5). The three steps are coincident with the
design demands of three user groups from experimental result. In this way, establish the
display and dissemination model of traditional Chinese furniture culture.
Information Acquisition of Traditional Furniture Culture: The prerequisite condi‐
tion of the cultural dissemination activities in the human society is to produce the cultural
knowledge information which could be spread by people. The culture of traditional
Chinese furniture is a huge system. As a result, the acquisition of furniture culture is an
important work because it is the starting point of the whole model. “The type of senior
experts”(advanced knowledge users) including collectors, furniture scholars and other
professional persons, through their social practice and creative thinking, acquire abun‐
dant culture knowledge, experiences and skills of the furniture. These are the cultural
knowledge of furniture, which can be spread by people. After choosing, analyzing,
processing and constructing, this cultural knowledge of furniture will rise to theoretical
cultural knowledge and which can be used as the contents for display and dissemination.
In the meanwhile, advanced knowledge users such as collectors and furniture scholars
are a relatively stable social group. They upload the cultural knowledge of furniture to
the digital platform and establish information database of furniture culture to form
abundant culture resources. Therefore, advanced knowledge users are important
members for information acquisition of traditional furniture culture.
Information Share of Traditional Furniture Culture: The group of advanced
knowledge users implements behaviors of knowledge dissemination to knowledge
communicators through the digital medium platform [7]. After accepting knowledge,
the group of intermediate level users processes it so as to decompose, restructure and
reproduce the culture information. By sharing the knowledge, information and experi‐
ence of traditional furniture culture via medium, the lowest level of the whole model
can receive the original and processed two kinds of cultural information. In the process
of dissemination, the information of traditional furniture culture could be share with the
help of the network platform, social media, App, cloud platform, public terminal equip‐
ment and other dissemination channels and technology. And then the contents will be
spread in a wider range.
Information Feedback of Traditional Furniture Culture: The receivers of the
dissemination of furniture culture receive the speciﬁc contents of cultural knowledge
information from the dissemination process. And then they take it into comprehensive
account with the knowledge accumulated before so that it is possible to produce new
knowledge and information. Then if there are new desires or demands of dissemination
among the groups of intermediate knowledge users and primary knowledge users, it
enters into a new knowledge dissemination process when put into practice. The original
receivers of knowledge dissemination actually become the “culture disseminator”
284
X. Sun and C. Li

because of their own innovation and dissemination behaviors of original furniture
culture knowledge. As for the original culture disseminator, it has been converted to
“the receivers of the culture dissemination” as a result of the demands and acceptance
of the knowledge spread by the original receivers of the knowledge dissemination. The
knowledge contents spread by the culture disseminator in this process is such an inno‐
vation based on the knowledge and information received and the knowledge accumu‐
lated before. And it is spread not only to the original culture disseminator, but also to
other members of the society. Therefore, such a new process of knowledge dissemination
is also the process of cultural information feedbacks.
The three links above build the process of the digitization of traditional furniture
culture. In the process, the dissemination of traditional Chinese furniture culture has
shown a trend of spread by groups. And furniture culture is displayed in digitization
with the help of digital medium. This process is sustainable, cyclical, constantly updated.
The knowledge of traditional furniture culture is able to get decomposed and restructured
and meet the knowledge demands of diﬀerent user groups so that the dissemination
model of traditional Chinese furniture culture is formed with information collection,
information sharing, and information reception and information feedback.
4.2
Strategies for Digital Display and Dissemination of Traditional Chinese
Furniture Culture Display in Digitization
The display of traditional Chinese furniture culture is supposed to combine with the
social environment, regional characteristics and humanistic spirit. Only create such a
cultural background will the traditional Chinese furniture show its material content and
spiritual culture and be known by more people. It requires us to reﬁne, classify and
summarize the contents of traditional Chinese furniture culture. In addition, t requires
us to show the cultural characteristic features of “express the meaning by the form” and
“reach the meaning by the scene” combined with digital display technology to embody
the furniture culture. As a kind of technical means, the digital display will penetrate in
all aspects of the display and dissemination of traditional Chinese furniture culture.
Diﬀerent display scenarios and dissemination stages need diﬀerent mediums. In addi‐
tion, it could be useful to exploit the advantages of the information dissemination in
Internet era and the functions of information dissemination of Mobile Internet terminal
products.
Experience and Share: After experiencing the industrial age that is characterized by
material consumption and occupation and emphasizes the function of the product, the
information society provides services and non-material products. As a result, the design
object is from substance to substance, from the product to service, from occupation to
share emphasizing the attributes of User Experience. It is the results of returning to the
original aims of design, cogitating on design and understanding the relationship between
user and product from a higher level. The relatively profound knowledge of traditional
culture concentrate in the “Loyal Fans” in the above study. These knowledge could not
only builds the “experts” experience for themselves by sharing, but also create funny
experience of acquiring knowledge for other knowledge receivers.
Digital Display and Transmission of the Culture
285

The Co-creation of Group Knowledge: In the future, the entity museum may disap‐
pear and develop sustainably in other forms. There will be a more equal and mutually
beneﬁcial relationship between the entity places of furniture culture dissemination such
as museums and the user. Knowledge becomes means of production shared jointly, and
the driving force of innovation comes from the joint eﬀorts of both parties. That is, the
user and the museum to create together. Therefore, the user is the most valuable produc‐
tive assets cultural display and dissemination in the future [8]. In the meanwhile, it will
change from individual behavior to group behavior, and also transform from personal
knowledge to group knowledge through tapping, building and sharing the culture
resources of traditional Chinese furniture culture together by groups of all classes of
society.

Conclusion and Future Works
Starting from the problems in the display and dissemination of traditional Chinese
furniture culture, this paper analyses the cultural connotation of traditional Chinese
furniture and points out that the display of traditional Chinese furniture culture can be
combined with PC network platform, mobile intelligent equipment, public platform,
Virtual Reality technology under the background of the digital medium and technology.
In order to understand the characteristics of the audience of traditional Chinese furniture,
this paper launches the investigation and analysis on the target user group and according
to the user’s academic background, interest, motivation, loyalty and other important
factors, divide the audience groups of traditional Chinese furniture into three types of
user groups from top to bottom: “the type of senior experts”— advanced knowledge
users, “the type of explore learning”— intermediate knowledge users and “the type of
hobby and experience”—the primary knowledge users. According to the “user-centric”
design concept, the paper establishes the display and dissemination model of traditional
Chinese furniture culture combine with the theory of knowledge dissemination. The
hierarchy of this model corresponds to the demands of the three user groups for infor‐
mation acquisition of traditional furniture culture, information share of traditional furni‐
ture culture and information feedback of traditional furniture culture. In addition, this
paper points out strategies for digital display and dissemination of traditional Chinese
furniture culture: display in digitization, experience and share and the co-creation of
group knowledge. What this paper discusses is not only the digital display means, but
also analyses the cultural audiences and establishes diﬀerent character models. What’s
more, the display model of furniture culture dissemination is also built from top to
bottom. In the process, the digital medium is kind of means, which services for the whole
model of culture display and dissemination.
The traditional furniture,which inherits from ancient advanced productive forces and
advanced culture, is so abundant and bright. The designers and researchers are supposed
to devote wisdom and strength into the traditional furniture. The purpose of the digital
display and dissemination of traditional Chinese furniture culture is, taking advantages
of modern digital media technology, to make more people make full use of the aging
characteristic of network resources and mobile Internet media through the mobile
286

terminal devices. By taking advantages of fragmented time, to realize and learn the
connotation and value of furniture culture, to establish a general national conﬁdence and
to enhance the context of furniture culture. The ﬁnal purpose is to turn the protection of
intangible cultural heritage into people’s conscious behaviors of culture Inheritance.

Abstract. Scientiﬁc and rational designing and construction of green infras-
tructure is an important part of the sustainable urbanization of China. In view of
this, deeper insights into the actual condition of campus landscape construction
in China’s urbanization process were gained by investigating 10 primary and
secondary schools on the spot and interviewing 20 experts and scholars.
A 12-experts panel Delphi questionnaire survey on the evaluation indexes of
Campus Landscape was conducted, and the suitability comprehensive evalua-
tion index system was established. By the division of suitability grade, the set
pair analysis theory was applied to the suitability comprehensive evaluation of
Campus Landscape. Finally, taking the Zundao School in Mianzhu as an
example, the school ground suitability comprehensive evaluation was made.

Introduction
China is known as one of the countries experiencing fastest urbanization development,
and the statistic from National Bureau of Statistics shows that the urbanization rate rose
from 51.27 % in 2011 to 52.57 % in 2012 and then to 53.73 % in 2013. Experts predict
that the urbanization rate will arrive at 80 % in 2030 [1]. Despite having made sig-
niﬁcant achievements, urbanization also suffers a lack of ecological civilization [2].
The problems such as the out-of-control land use, the lower quality of regional envi-
ronment, and the ecological destruction in urbanization construction, etc. [3], have
posed a severe challenge to the sustainable and healthy development of cities.
The urbanization of China must consist with China’s national condition and the
concept of sustainable development, since it is the inevitable choice in the path toward
ecological civilization. As a result of this, the development of urban green infras-
tructures is thought of as a signiﬁcant measure to address urbanization problems and
relevant urban problems by Chinese governments at all levels and the workers of

landscape architecture, who have achieved remarkable effects through the successive
implementation of landscaping projects as well as the protection and utilization of
scenic spots [4].
Campus green space is the second largest green space in cities behind park.
Notwithstanding the smaller area, campus is likely to make greater ecological contribu-
tions than the park as a habitat because cities are always brimming with a large quantity of
homogeneous and scattered campuses. Provided campus landscape is properly built as a
friendly habitat and connected through ecological corridor to shape an ecological network
where living beings can shuttle between different habitats, it is inevitable that campus will
play an irreplaceable role in protecting urban ecological safety, highlighting urban
characteristics, and guaranteeing urban sustainable development.
The construction of eco-friendly campus landscape not only helps to maintain
campus biodiversity, but also takes into account campus beautiﬁcation and greening.
Besides offering the teaching materials required by the education of natural science as
the ideal place of outdoor teaching, campus landscape can contribute to physical and
mental health of children. The outdoor experiential education can motivate children to
learn, and involve them in the signiﬁcant learning in campus learning habitat regarding
new knowledge and skills to broaden their vision. Campus landscape can enable
children to become aware of the life value, understand and respect universal living
beings in learning process, develop their outlook on ecology and fully realize the
beauty of nature. In this way, children will endeavor to strive for an agreeable envi-
ronment in the future.

Survey on Campus Landscape Construction of Primary
and Secondary Schools
2.1
Investigate Primary and Secondary Schools on the Spot
In order to gain deeper insights into the actual condition of campus landscape con-
struction in China’s urbanization process, the researcher has devised a biological
habitat questionnaire, made a ﬁeld survey on 10 local schools (see Table 1), and used
the result obtained as the reference for Delphi method questionnaire.
• As shown by the ﬁeld survey, the ﬂoor space of these schools ranges from 10,000 to
40,000 m2, with over 50 % of the ground made up of hard pavement.

Survey on Campus Landscape Construction

• 60 % of campuses are adjacent to streets, and a lower number of biological species
and living beings are allowed to enter campus from outside. However, a minority of
schools neighbor uncultivated land or agricultural land, but the enclosure cannot
stop the living beings from jumping into campus. As a result, the uncultivated land
or agricultural land naturally becomes the heartland of schools, and besides, bio-
diversity is also raised as the living beings shuttle between school and outside
environment.
• While designing and constructing a building, few schools take into consideration
biological channels. In view of this, the researcher carries out an investigation into
campus road system, ﬁnding that only 30 % of schools take advantage of natural
materials. The footpath paved by Xiaoquan National Primary School with aban-
doned stones, for instance, shows distinct characteristic, whereas most of primary
schools tend to make use of asphalt or cement, which is adverse to the activity of
organisms in campus.
• In terms of plants selection, the researcher ﬁnds that 40 % of schools incline to
grow native plants, and others prefer growing plants based on visual landscape.
Though such plants are not ecologically meaningless, schools are heavy with
landscape streets, which have obviously occupied the survival space of native
plants.
• In order to maintain the beauty of campus, 90 % of schools assign weeding task to
special person regularly, 70 % of them resorting to pesticide.
• Though 70 % of schools are equipped with a pool, none of them has built a creek.
The bottom of the pool is made of cement and tile, without pores or side slopes for
organisms, thus going against the requirements of ecological pool.
2.2
Interview with the Workers of Environmental Education Affairs
An interview with the management experts and environmental education workers of the
schools above is conducted, and their working experience has educated the researcher
about the concept and methods of campus landscape construction. According to the
analysis on the identical and different views of the interviewees, the consistent opinions
and conclusions are included in Delphi method questionnaire as reference. The inter-
viewing result is summarized as follows:
• The interviews believe that campus biodiversity can contribute to building a new
less-polluted Chinese town on the way to sustainable development.
• 60 % of interviewees argue that campus should be equipped with the habitats such
as tree, grassland, and pond to attract varieties of organisms, whereas the remaining
interviewees insist that there is no need to classify habitats, and the campus should
be let develop naturally to attract the organisms.
• In terms of management, human intervention in organisms should be lessened, and
the environment should be let develop naturally within permission limit. For
instance, there is a need to sweep the fallen leaves, as well as reduce the weeding
frequency and the use rate of pesticide. Besides, schools are supposed to arrange
290
W. Wang et al.

special person or group to protect and monitor school’s ecological environment so
as to guarantee the sustainability of the biologically diverse campus environments.
• The interviewees hold that campus landscape construction requires multiparty
participation. Administrative director is of great importance, since campus man-
agement is in the charge of administrative director. Additionally, a group of
like-minded teachers are required to make environmental plan and design the course
with joint efforts for the sake of the education about natural ecology. Besides, to
seek the sponsorship of relevant units is also of vital signiﬁcance; otherwise, it will
be difﬁcult to carry out the education of natural ecology based on a utopian scheme.
While establishing the habitat design course, campus could provide an environment
more suitable for learning if experts offer consultation service and assistance.
• The eco-friendly campus landscape is usually beneﬁcial to environmental teaching,
since teachers and children can often see the ecological natural phenomena such as
about natural evolution, survival of the ﬁttest, and the law of the jungle. Besides, the
eco-friendly campus landscape can realize the functions such as life education,
ecological teaching, and design of teaching situation.

Methods of Suitability Comprehensive Evaluation
3.1
Building of Evaluation Index System
As an outdoor learning place, campus landscape can inspire children to make dis-
coveries, explorations, interactions, and individual communications in environment,
and enhance the relationship with environment and the sense of ownership. To evaluate
campus landscape is of vital practical signiﬁcance [5, 6]. Suitability evaluation, fre-
quently used in environmental planning, is primarily applied to urban construction
land, agricultural land, natural reserves or tourism land, regional planning and land-
scape planning, project site, and environmental inﬂuence, etc. [7–9]. Considering that
campus landscape is a combination of humanistic education, social economy, and
eco-environmental system, the quality of environmental landscape construction is
judged by means of suitability evaluation.
According to the information obtained through the ﬁeld survey on the schools
above and the interview with the workers of environmental education, this study
complies the candidate index list for the comprehensive evaluation on campus land-
scape suitability as well as the Delphi method questionnaire. Then, 12 experts are
invited to participate in the questionnaire survey until the questionnaire survey result
converges. Afterwards, a statistical analysis is performed to build an evaluation index
system.
Comprehensive Evaluation Index System of Campus Landscape Suitability
includes four grades. Grade-I Index is comprehensive evaluation on campus landscape
suitability. Grade-II Indexes are Inclusivity, Natural Environment, Place and Property,
Flexibility and Changes. The Grade-II Index Weight corresponding respectively are A1
(0.285), A2 (0.222), A3 (0.358), A4 (0.135). The Grade-III Index and Grade-IV Index
are shown in Table 2.

Set Pair Analysis
Set pair analysis (SPA) is a systematic analysis method that processes identical-
discrepant-contrary quantitative analysis in the indeterminate system. Set pair analysis,
proposed by Zhao Keqin-a Chinese scholar-in 1989, performs an analysis on the
system from identical, discrepant and contrary angles, as well as studies the mutual
transformation among them. The comprehensive evaluation on campus landscape
suitability faces varieties of uncertainties, which can be effectively eliminated by means
of set pair analysis.
The basic thinking of set pair analysis is: in the face of a certain question, two
correlated sets X and Y are given to form a set pair (X, Y), and then, an analysis is
performed on the set pair to ﬁgure out N characteristics, with S characteristics shared
by the two sets X and Y, P characteristics contrary between the two sets X and Y, and
F = N-S-P characteristics unclear (they are neither contrary nor commonly owned).
S/N is deﬁned as the identical degree H(X,Y), denoted by a; F/N is deﬁned as dis-
crepant degree or uncertain degree H(X,Y), denoted by b; P/N is deﬁned as contrary

paper, the weight of each index in the comprehensive evaluation index system of
campus site suitability in urban primary and middle schools is determined by means of
AHP [11].

Grading of Suitability
The evaluation has three grades, namely, highly suitable, suitable, and unsuitable.
When the weights of all the indices at the same grade are added together, the suitability
evaluation result of the campus site can be obtained through Eq. (1) and denoted by
correlation degree l. As shown by Eq. (1), j = −1, and the value of i is obtained from
[−1,1]; according to principle of equipartition, i = 0. Since the value range of the
normalized correlation coefﬁcient l is [−1,1], the suitability grade corresponding to
correlation coefﬁcient can be seen in Table 3.

In suitability evaluation, i has different values, which can reﬂect not only the
suitability of campus site, but also the design, construction, and management level of
this site. When i = 1, l corresponds to the highest suitability of the site; when i = −1, l
corresponds to the lowest suitability of the site. The parties of campus site planning,
construction, and management may on the one hand ﬁnd out the vulnerabilities and
non-sustainable factors according to the evaluation result of each index in index sys-
tem, and on the other judge the grade of site suitability and work out the suitability
degree of the campus site according to the value range of l. On this basis, they can
upgrade the suitability of the site through corresponding measures.
When c 6¼ 0 in l = a + bi + cj-the equation of correlation degree, a/c-the ratio of
the identical degree a to contrary degree c means the set pair trend against the back-
ground of a speciﬁc question, i.e., shi (H) = a/c. The order of the set pair trend that is
arranged according to a/c value is termed as set pair trend order, with the relationship
between the grade and order of set pair trend shown in Table 4 [12]. The set pair trend
has revealed the development trend of site suitability, which has provided a direction
for the parties of campus site planning, construction, and management.

Case Study
Mianzhu Zundao School is a nine-year compulsory education school, and Zun-
daochang Town is 8 km away from the west of Mianzhu City. The 5.12 Wenchuan
Earthquake in 2008 has delivered a heavy blow to Zundao School, 99 % of the
teaching building turned into dilapidated building, all teaching facilities destructed.
Following the urbanization of China after disaster, the renowned real estate company
China Vanke donated a large sum of money to Zundao School for the sake of
rebuilding. Covering a ﬂoor space of 35,666.67 ㎡and a built-up area of 11,793.00 ㎡,
the campus is equipped with web-based teaching facilities suitable in the 21st century,
and the buildings are constructed with the advanced earthquake-proof technique that
can resist against the seismic magnitude up to 9 degree. Meanwhile, the campus, near
the mountain and by the river, highlights environmental landscape and comes out as a
representative new urbanized school. Characterized by beautiful environment, mod-
ernization, humanistic care, and safety, the campus develops into the paradise where
children learn knowledge (see Fig. 1).
This study carries out a comprehensive evaluation on the suitability of this campus
site by means of the abovementioned suitability evaluation system, with the evaluation
result shown in Table 2.
According to the evaluation method above, the correlation degree can be ﬁgured
out through Eq. (1):

l ¼ 0:185 þ 0:727i þ 0:088j
ð2Þ
When i = 0, l = 0.097; the grade of environmental landscape suitability of
Mianzhu Zundao School will be suitable, as shown in Table 3.
When i = 1 and i = −1, l1 = 0.824 and l2 = −0.63, respectively, with the value
range of l being [−0.63, 0.824]. This suggests that the campus site will be most
suitable when l1 = 0.824, and its grade will be highly suitable; however, the parties of
campus site planning, construction and management should not feel satisﬁed with the
present suitability degree of the campus site, but ﬁnd out the vulnerabilities and identify
the non-sustainable factors according to the unsuitable evaluation index and then
upgrade the comprehensive level of campus site suitability with corresponding
measures.
Analysis on set pair trend: in Eq. (2), a/c = 2.10, a > c, and b > a, which suggests
that the system has a very weak identical trend; that is, the campus site is at suitable
grade, but there is a very weak highly suitable trend. Additionally, b has a high value,
which means that the index weight of suitable grade accounts for a large proportion.
However, these indexes, which are seemingly suitable, will face grade decline as the
campus site requirements and evaluation requirements increase; therefore, to avoid the
unsuitable grade, there is a need to check these indices carefully and take corre-
sponding measures to attain the highly suitable grade.

Conclusion
By investigating present construction situation, it was found that the Campus Land-
scape which was consistent with biodiversity and suitable for environmental education
should possess the following 4 conditions: (1) building the comprehensive landscape
site; (2) building the diverse biotopes environment; (3) implementing environmental
education; (4) taking multi-participative construction and management measures.
Comprehensive evaluation index system of campus landscape suitability was
conducted. There were 66 indicators involved in 4 categories being built: (1) inclu-
sivity; (2) natural environment; (3) place and property; (4) ﬂexibility and changes. In
accordance with the Analytic Hierarchy Process and Set Pair Analysis, a scientiﬁc and
objective platform was created for green campus decision-making operability in
China’s urbanization process.

Abstract. The Article tries to apply Kansei Engineering theory to build up a
relationship between the design elements for control panel design of automobile
cabins and the perceptual evaluation of users. By integrating design features of
the automobile control panel with the evaluation procedure for perceptual image
design, an association model is ﬁnally established between the design elements
for the control panel relating to the interior decoration of automobile cabins and
the perceptual evaluation of users through screening of design patterns for the
control panel, cognitive study on the perceptual image and by using the com-
position of design element system. During the study, perceptual evaluation data
of test samples is obtained with the method of semantic differential. Combined
with the design decomposition elements obtained via morphological analysis, an
association model between the design elements and the perceptual evaluation is
obtained with factor analysis method to determine the relationship of them and
help to forecast the perceptual evaluation value. The article establishes a forecast
that the association model can be used for the perceptual evaluation value of
cabin interior decoration, and forms a set of systematic and scientiﬁc evaluation
methodology for the interior decoration design of automobile cabins by
describing and verifying the design methods for the control panel in cabins.

Introduction
People began to transfer attention to the automotive interior gradually from the born of
car when they tirelessly pursued the automotive mechanical properties and appearance
in Nineteenth Century. Whether the auto control design was good or bad directly
related to the evaluation of people driving experience, the comfortable, entertaining and
easy operation affected the automobile industry development greatly [1]. Different
interior systems been placed in the environment of man - cockpit took different levels
of impact to the driver’s psychological and physiological, thereby affected the drivers’
operation. In the ﬁeld of design, using the method of Kansei Engineering could

combine the design elements and the user’s feelings, and establish the model of the
relationship between the two [2]. TANOU in Japan [3], HSIAO in Taiwan, China etc.
[4] all used these research means.
Therefore, this paper used the theory of Kansei Engineering, took the central
console of the intermediate car in the market as the research object of the design
evaluation, in order to produce the product design evaluation method which was in line
with the consumer’s perceptual demand.

Introduction of Kansei Engineering
The term of “Kansei Engineering” was ﬁrst proposed by Japanese scholars in the
speech of “the theory of automobile culture” at the University of Michigan in 1986 [5].
It was a theory or method to explore the relationship between the “human” sensibility
and design characteristics of the “object” by using engineering technology [6, 7]. In the
process of product design, the core part of the emotional design was to take emotional
images and feelings into the elements of product design, help designers to grasp the
product characteristics, understand its relationship with consumer sensory images, so as
to determine whether these evaluations were in line with the designers’ intentions at
image.

The Design Overview of Car Cockpit Interior
Central control console, door trim, instrument panel, seat, steering wheel, etc. all
belonged to the automotive interior. The dashboard, door trim, seats were paid more
attention by people. In contrast, the console was often easy to be ignored, and was
rarely involved even in the automotive related research. But with the development of
automobile industry, console was given more functions, for example: giving drivers
more driving information, improving the comfort and automatic operation, increasing
more control panel and display, all kinds of audio equipment, air conditioning
equipment switch, glove box, cup holder and so on, which made it become a very
important part of the automobile interior design. As a result, it should be paid more
attention in the automotive development and design phase.
Console layout mainly included two forms, the one was independent existence
between the driving seat and the deputy driving seat which was common in the mini car
or truck; another was connected together with the dashboard, which was common in
high-grade car, this paper took the console in this form as the research object.

Research Scheme Design under the Framework of Kansei
Engineering
Research method of the Kansei Engineering was introduced in this paper, it took four
steps to establish the evaluation model of the automobile control platform. First of all,
collecting the representative samples of the vehicle console which took a clear design

orientation, next building the control system and the related model of console based on
on the perceptual image cognition of the central control station, so as to determine the
relationship between the user’s perceptual evaluation and the design elements of the
central control station, and use the obtained perceptual evaluation to guide the design of
the automobile control platform.
1. Collecting samples the car console which took a clear design orientation. The
console design evaluation from the perceptual image started from the target user’s
demand survey research, the difference of design positioning meant that the cor-
responding user perceptual cognition and demand were different. Therefore, it
should clear the design and positioning of the console samples ﬁrstly, clear product
target user group. Secondly, it should collect 58 sample table modeling pictures of
console extensively, classify these pictures preliminary, subjective screen on the
basis of clarity and angle, determine a set of representative sample pictures, and use
gray treatment to remove the color factor, as shown in Fig. 1.
2. Determining the representative perceptual vocabulary. Collecting emotional
adjectives which were descriptions of console as much as possible according to the
manufacturer’s website, books, magazines, newspapers and consumer interviews
and other ways, excluding semantic fuzziness vocabularies by screening, selecting
residual perceptual describe words through questionnaire and cluster analysis, and
choosing 6 groups most from a hierarchical perceptual vocabulary descriptions of
the console. As shown in Table 1:
3. Determining user questionnaire. Determining the representative quotations by the
numbers of representative samples and combination, and establishing the semantics
difference scale table of vehicle console. Controlling the reliability and validity of
the scale table in order to ensure the accuracy of the survey.
4. The evaluation and analysis of the user to the automobile console. Through Users
evaluated the representative samples of the console by the questionnaire, so as to
obtain the user’s perception of the console.

5. Establishing the relationship model between the model elements and the perceptual
evaluation of the vehicle console and drawing the conclusion. Determining the
main product features and design elements of the representative samples, and
transforming the perceptual evaluation to the engineering scale by the gray data
theory and multiple regression analysis. Summarizing the corresponding relation-
ship between the modeling elements and the perceptual evaluation of the car
console, and concluding the evaluation method of the vehicle console based on the
perceptual image.

Method Validation
The car console design was taken as a case in this paper, it determined that the target
consumers of car were college graduates about 5 years, their consumption patterns
were dominated by their internal psychological factors with distinctive psychological
characteristics. The representative sample in this experiment were determined through
this method, and were classiﬁed and analyzed by using the method of multiple scales,
design personnel classiﬁcation standard and coordinate value were found through the
SPSS software, the pictures of ﬁnal samples were obtained through clustering analysis.
The evaluation of users to the car console were got by the network questionnaire in
this time, the questionnaire contained personal information, the car console evaluation
and the car console needs these three parts, as shown in Fig. 2.
The questionnaire data and descriptive statistical analysis were done, and the data
matrix of the console sample was obtained, as shown in Table 3. 6 sets of perceptual
vocabulary were setted as the variable X to make the decision of the principal com-
ponent analysis, and the main component of the contribution rate and the high load
factor of the common factor were obtained.

As shown in Table 2, the rotated component matrix was obtained through the initial
component load matrix of varimax orthogonal rotation, it could be seen the ﬁrst
common factors of high load variables were Y2, Y3, Y5, which were classiﬁed as form
factor according to the semantic. The second the high load factor on the high load was
Y1, Y6 was the second common factor on the high load of variables, which deﬁned as
the quality factor. Y4 was the variable of high load on the third factor, which was
deﬁned as the value factor. Thus, the semantic core of the 6 groups perceptual words
were summed up, and potential factors were dug out.
The component score coefﬁcient matrix was obtained according to the Thomson
regression method, and the spatial model of console perceptual image was set up as
follows:
Form factor = −0.202Y1 + 0.259Y2 + 0.562Y3 −0.013Y4 + 0.500Y5−0.300Y6.
Quality factor = 0.357Y1 −0.097Y2 −0.210Y3 −0.031Y4 −0.230Y5 + 0.956Y6.
Valuefactor = −0.129Y1 + 0.172Y2 + 0.032Y3 + 0.963Y4−0.134Y5+0.026Y6.
Perceptual image spatial model described the constitution of the automobile con-
sole from the perspective of semantics. The console design elements and image spatial
were explored further in this paper, as shown in Table 3, the function mapping rela-
tionship between design elements and emotional semantic were established through
multiple linear regression method, and emotional design concept model of console was
proposed.
As shown in Table 4, the relevance amount of design elements to the emotional
vocabulary could be found according to the design factor regression analysis coefﬁcient
table. Taking the quality of sense as an example, when a user needed a “sense of

Abstract. As the current service design process is not suitable for Alipay O2O
service due to the particularity of users, product and service in China, our own
service design process that is based on the Customer Journey Map (CJM) has
been formed. This process forms ﬁve concepts (Steps, Matters, Contents,
Details, and Sensory) according to the process of conﬁrming the ﬁve user
experience elements (The Strategy Plane, The Scope Plane, The Structure Plane,
The Skeleton Plane, and The Surface Plane). This paper takes Chinajoy as an
example to introduce the process on basis of ﬁve concepts in detail. The com-
plete process begin with making CJM, then ascertaining Steps and listing
Matters, furthermore proposing and overviewing Contents, clearing Details,
ﬁnally accomplishing Sensory. Reﬁnement in each phase is not a linear
movement, but a to-and-fro and interactive process. When designing the con-
tents on each phase, information at the former steps should be iteratively opti-
mized so as to create better user experience.

Introduction
Since 2013, a fundamental change from online payment product to online-to-ofﬂine
(O2O) payment service is discernable in Alipay, which is the biggest Third-Party
Payment platform in China. As a result, we start to explore with service design
methodology in O2O payment service, and the tool we used most is Customer Journey
Map (CJM).
However, we gradually realized that we don’t know how to transform the contents
of CJM into the services. While a large number of literatures focused on the deﬁnition,
methods and tools of service design, and the method of how to make a CJM [1–8], the
process of how to use CJM is still lacking. And the current service design process
is not suitable for Alipay O2O service due to the lack of localization to China, for
the two reasons: (1) The difference of the number of users: Services come to existence
at the same moment they are being provided and used. That means the huge difference
of the number of users possibly result in huge differences in terms of designing the
services [8]. And the current service design process hasn’t been veriﬁed by the situation
of large population. (2) The difference of the products and services: Alipay is morphing
into all-in-one banking tool: a savings bank, wire service and investment house. Most
importantly, it’s all done via mobile device. Using Alipay app, you can buy anything

you want online and in brick and mortar stores, send money to friends, make
cross-border transactions, and earn a healthy interest on your balance. Alipay is unique
worldwide.
In order to ﬁlling up the blank, we reviewed and found that the traditional expe-
rience design process is the process to establish the contents of the ﬁve elements of user
experience (Surface, Skeleton, Structure, Scope, and Strategy) [9] in essence. On this
aspect, it is in line with service design. So we decided to form the service design
process according to the process of conﬁrming the ﬁve user experience elements.
Finally, our own service design process, which is CJM-based, has been formed.
This paper will take Chinajoy (China International Digital Interactive Entertain-
ment Products and Technology Exhibition, hereinafter referred to as “CJ”) as an
example to introduce the process in detail. CJ is held in Shanghai every summer. It lasts
four days, and up to about 200 thousand people participates every year. Every par-
ticipant typically needs to line up for a long time due to the huge number of people. In
peak hours, the queue for checking can cost up to 2 to 3 h. We used our service design
process to design the CJ electronic tickets’ selling and checking process. The result has
proven to be a success in 2014 and 2015. And this is also the ﬁrst signiﬁcant success
for Alipay to provide E-tickets’ checking service in large-scale ofﬂine event.

Five Concepts Through CJM
In The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web, Jesse James
Garrett gives a detailed introduction about the ﬁve elements of user experience [9]. As
these ﬁve elements are proposed in traditional experience design, to make them more
applicable in service design, we’ve done some simple revisions (see Fig. 1).
Fig. 1. The Deﬁnition of the Five Planes
306
F. Yang and L. Qu

2.1
The Strategy Plane
Generally speaking, the needs of major stakeholders are in the back and front stage of
service [10], but CJM tends to show the front stage more [4]. Therefore, extract users’
needs, rather than the stakeholders’, from CJM is effective. The upside is the stake-
holders’ interests already become relatively clear before a service being carried out.
2.2
The Scope Plane: Steps and Matters
When using the CJM to complete Steps and Matters on the scope plane, the contents of
“Phase”, “Do”, “Hear”, “See”, “Say”, and “Thoughts” in CJM will be referred to. The
steps are as follows:
• Steps Design
(a) Review the variety and location relevant centralization of touchpoints in dif-
ferent phases of CJM, which will decide that we may have to use a different
method to design the Steps. Here, location relevant centralization refers to the
distance between touchpoints and users. If users take mobiles wherever they go,
then location relevant centralization of mobiles is high. Generally speaking, the
smaller the distance, the higher the location relevant centralization, and the
lower the mobility costs for users, the easier design becomes.
(b) For phases where touchpoints exist in fewer than three types and have cen-
tralized locations, Steps design can directly refer to “Do” in CJM. In the phase
of E-ticket buying in CJ project, touchpoints are mostly mobiles, so the contents
of “Do” in CJM can be directly referred to. In this process, unreasonable Steps
from “Do” should be optimized and simpliﬁed to the largest extent on the basis
of being in line with user cognition and habit.
(c) For phases where touchpoints exist in more than three types and have disperse
locations, location should be factored. In this case, other methods such as
circulation design should be selected to design Steps according to the on-site
environment.
• Matters Design
The Steps needs to be decomposed into possible Matters based on “what users’ and
stakeholders’ need” from the Strategy Plane and the lanes from the CJM.
(a) In this process, users’ needs should be detailed by delving into “Thoughts” and
“Feelings” in CJM and taking “Issues” and “Opportunities” as supplement, while
stakeholders’ needs will be clariﬁed by their representatives during the project.
(b) New ideas that may be generated during the above process need to complement
the Steps.
(c) Determine the priority of Matters. Matters with the highest priority are which will
cause process suspension without being accomplished; Matters with second high
priority are which frequently take place in each Step. When project resources are
limited, accomplishing Matters with high priority is the precondition to basic user
experience.
CJM-Based Service Design Process
307

Take E-ticket buying (the phase in which touchpoints have limited variety and
centralized locations) as an example, the four Steps in this phase all come from “Do” in
the CJM. From the thoughts that users have in each Step, we can know their possible
needs. For example, in Step “Place Orders”, from the thought “Know more about
invoice information.” or “Can I buy one for my friend?”, we can create the Matter
“Learn more about E-ticket buying rules.” If E-ticket sellers want personal information
of users so as to promote notiﬁcations, we can create the Matter “Fill in personal
information.” Therefore, we come to the following Fig. 2:
In the phase “Yet-To Enter” of CJM, we can make use of circulation design in
designing Steps and Matters. If to combine the “Do” contents with the circulation map
about how users get to the convention center, we can ﬁnd out key points in the route,
namely, Steps. For example, the only entrance-No.1 Entrance of exhibition this time is
a very important Step, not only because that all users have to enter through this
entrance, but also because it is a target location of all users (see Fig. 3).
Matters in every Step will be decided by “Do” and “See”. For example, at the No.1
Entrance Hall, users may look around for Alipay E-ticket Check while walking ahead,
so we can create the Matter “Search Alipay E-ticket Check”.
2.3
The Structure Plane: Contents
While completing Contents on the structural plane with CJM, the contents of
“Touchpoints”, “Environment” etc. in CJM will be used. The steps are as follows:
(d) To classify touchpoints according to the people and physical objects for man-
agement convenience.
(e) To rename the classiﬁed touchpoints and set separate lane for them. Finally, to
complete the Touchpoints Lane according to the Fig. 4 below.
Fig. 2. The example of Steps and Matters: CJ E-ticket buying
308
F. Yang and L. Qu

(f) To consider the relevance of “Touchpoints” and “Environment” while designing
Contents from Matters in each Step. Generally speaking, to design the Contents
needed in each touchpoints based on the two questions: “Are these touchpoints
suitable to accomplish these Matters?” and “How to accomplish them?”.
Fig. 3. The Circulation Design of CJ
Fig. 4. The Touchpoints Lane
CJM-Based Service Design Process
309

We have mentioned before that No. 1 Entrance Hall is a key Step where users may
have the Matter “Search Alipay E-ticket Check”. When reviewing all Touchpoints Lanes,
we can ﬁnd that in “Service Employees”, “Materials”, “Alipay APP” and “Promotions”,
the former two can accomplish this Matter. So “Service Employees” and “Materials”
should have Contents such as “showing up in the sight of users /informing users the
location of E-ticket checking/informing users how to go to wicket and how far it is”.
According to the variety of Touchpoints Lane, all Contents of this variety should be
reviewed:
• From the perspective of ensuring contents management and uniformity, design
modules for Contents that have the same contents and functions should be created.
• From the perspective of saving design and production costs, Contents that have the
same geographic location touchpoints should be integrated.
• From the perspective of ensuring the completeness of process, breaks between each
Step should be modiﬁed, and the whole process be improved.
• From the perspective of information load of each touchpoints, Contents that are
overloaded should be split up once again. While doing this, Steps may be affected in
the other way around. If that happens, Steps need to be revised, supplement or re
recombined.
2.4
The Skeleton Plane: Details
For the online part, traditional experience design process can be referred to in designing
Details of the Skeleton Plane. This paper will explain in detail how to use the CJM to
design the Details in ofﬂine part where CJM can give full play to its strength.
The common practice is to reversely deduce every single Details that can be
clariﬁed with CJM according to the ﬁnal deliverables, extract useful information from
“Environment”, “Do”, “Hear”, “See”, “Say”, “Thought” and other information in the
CJM, and thus design the Details of people or objects in each segment of ofﬂine part.
Take on-site materials as an example, things needed in delivery are: Wireframe of
materials, Functions, Dimension, Number, Position, Speciﬁcs, Environment Descrip-
tion, and Note. As for Environment Description, Number and Dimension, they can be
acquired from “Environment” of CJM; the Positions can be acquired from “Do” and
“See”; and the Speciﬁcs, from “Environment” and “Do”…
The speciﬁc Contents of materials in No. 1 Entrance Hall are as below (Fig. 5).

Ultimately, the deliverables (Fig. 6) we will output are corresponding to every
Touchpoints Lane that were obtained from the Structure Plane.

2.5
The Surface Plane: Sensory
The success of design for the Surface Plane depends on the designers’ experience and
inquisitive mind. CJM has a quite limited role on this plane.
As for how to do the ﬁve sensory design, there are large number of literatures
available in relevant subject, so we will not dilate upon this topic.
Some deliverables of Details may need to be visualized on this plane. Finally, we
obtained 3 sets of visuals for CJ program (Fig. 7).

Conclusion
Obviously,
ﬁve
signiﬁcance
concepts-Steps,
Matters,
Contents,
Details,
and
Sensory-are formed according to the process of conﬁrming the ﬁve user experience
elements from CJM (see Fig. 8).
Before design, we need to reconstruct the real scenario—make the CJM ﬁrst. The
Fig. 9 is a draft of CJM in the CJ E-ticket checking segment.
Next, we can start describing the process of service design on the basis of this draft.
The whole process and its deliverables are as follows (see Fig. 10).
From the above process, one can ﬁnd that in service design process, we still follow
the idea of the ﬁve elements of user experience. Reﬁnement in each phase is not a linear
movement, but a to-and-fro and interactive process (see Fig. 11). When designing the
contents on each phase, information at the former steps should be iteratively optimized
so as to create better user experience.

Prospect
Although the results are good when we put this service design process into practice in
other project, which based on CJM, there are still more to do to verify the applicability.
As this process is based on CJM and Alipay, we‘ll optimize the process on two aspects:
• We cannot afﬁrm the process will be suitable also for the back stage design, because
CJM only involves front stage design. Besides, CJM is just one of many tools of
service design. We will continue to explore the process’ validation when using
other tools such as service blueprint.
• It possibly has some defects that our own business and team could not realize
because of our mindset. So we are putting this process into practice to other
business units and teams now, and we’ll revise the whole process according to the
outcome.

Abstract. Maker space could be simply understood as the place where the guests
doing things together. This concept could be traced back to the source-“hacker space”
in the European, now it developed into a new form of organization and service plat‐
form. It promoted knowledge sharing, cross-border cooperation, creative achieve‐
ment and even product through providing open space physics and prototype
processing equipment to makers and organizing relevant meetings and workshops.
According to a maker space list in Wikipedia, it shown that currently there were 2001
invasive space totally in the global. Among them, 1225 maker spaces were recorded
as creative space, 355 maker space were planed to be build. These maker spaces were
different in styles: some maker spaces mainly were centralized of Geek for coding
technology, music recording and technical design; some maker space mainly focused
on art design and hand-made; some maker space covered two forms which could
create hybrid. According to the service object and function of maker space, it could
be divided into the following four types: FabLabs, Hackerspaces, TechShops, Maker‐
spaces operation mode, and it shown the characteristics of specialization, commerci‐
alization, etc. According to the difference among operation mode of maker space,
investment and business service system etc., the following several modes of maker
space existed currently in China: training investment, aggregate type and new type of
real estate, the media driven, financing service, industry chain service and integrated
business ecological system type.
This paper used the research and comparative analysis method, it made a compar‐
ison for brand operation mode of maker space in China and America, compared and
analyzed development goals, talent team construction and organization operation
mechanism of maker space between China and America. It focused on understanding
the latest developments and implementation strategy of innovative talents training and
maker space in the United States, put forward development strategy of maker space
in China with American maker space brand operation and management experience,
and provided reference for Chinese new geek culture mode.

Introduction
Makers initially were groups with innovative talent and hobby who focused on designing
prototype products by use of digital technology, after they became maker groups who
were keen for practice, shared technology and exchanged ideas for innovative. Makers

were the representatives of the individual design and manufacturing groups who were
most passionate and dynamic, they created a better life with their own creativity. The
former chief editor of “Wired”-Anderson forecast in “Makers:The New Industrial Revo‐
lution” that people would use the wisdom of the network in the real world in the next
ten years. The future not only belonged to network companies which based on the virtual
principle, but also belonged to those industries deeply rooted in the real world. “Maker
movement” was a booster which let the digital world truly overthrew the real world, it
was new wave with landmark signiﬁcance. The world would realize the creation of the
whole people, and set oﬀ a new round of industrial revolution.
With the popularity of global maker culture and the rising demand of public innovation
and public entrepreneurial, it took the talent aggregation, classification, and management
operation mode into national policy making system, and became an important part of maker
movement in different countries. As the earliest nation who implemented the maker culture-
America, it had the latest research trends and practical strategies in construction, develop‐
ment and operation mechanism of the maker space. On the basis of this, it could provide
theoretical reference and inspiration for the development of China’s maker space.

Maker Space Brand
2.1
The Development and Reason of the United States Maker Space Brand
2.1.1
Development History of the United States Maker Space Brand
“Maker” was derived from the comprehensive interpretation of words Maker and
Hacker, it referred to software and hardware products which DIY their own creativity.
1984 Hamburg, Germany established the largest and earliest Chaos Computer Club at
that time. “The godfather of maker”- Mitch Altman was inspired after participating the
Chaos Communication Camp in Germany at 2007, in the San Francisco he founded the
most famous maker space brand -Noisebridge after returning to the United States.
Subsequently, under the promotion by Mitch Altman, maker space had a rapid devel‐
opment in the global. TechShop, who was called as “the ﬁrst national open public work‐
shop in the United States”, was a proﬁt-making organization founded in California in
2006. maker space- Attisan’s Asylum in Auckland was found by the maker-Gui Caval‐
canti in 2010, as a non-proﬁt service organizations, members could use diﬀerent public
tools for 24 h only need to pay the membership fee.
2.1.2
The Reason of the United States Maker Space Brand Development
The United States was a paradise for thinker, inventor, and entrepreneur, it seemed that
American were full of innovation spirit. There were many high tech industries in Silicon
Valley, it originated from the early garage makers in the United States. The success of
a large number of well-known enterprises, such as the United States CISCO, Intel,
Amazon etc. all promoted the success of the United States “garage culture”. At the same
time, the United States was the ﬁrst country to pay attention to entrepreneurship educa‐
tion, it provided diﬀerent channels of entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurship

competition and entrepreneurship education institutions. In recent years, more and more
Americans created any products through the 3D printer, laser cutting machine, design
software which was easy to use and desktop manufacturing equipment. They expected
to enjoy the pleasure of creating production by own hands, shared the results through
the network, and created the future of open source together.
2.2
Three Representative Models of the United States Maker Space Brand
2.2.1
Hobby Gathering Model – Taking NoiseBridge as an Example
NoiseBridge in the United States was located on the west coast of San Francisco City,
it was a non-proﬁt educational institutions for the public interest. 5200 square feet of
space was located in the city center, the monthly operating expenses was more than 5000
U.S. dollars. As an open maker space, there was no need to pay fees and free to participate
in training courses, and even directly went into the maker space to start work. Funding
mainly come from the donation by the members, the members had a periodic donations
payment of $10, $30 and $60 in a monthly, it could also be a one-time donation. Every
week NoiseBridge would open training courses or seminars and other activities attract
a large number of like-minded makers to participate, while promoted the culture of
maker.
2.2.2
Proﬁt Oriented Model – Taking TechShop as an Example
TechShop was the largest maker space linkage mechanism in the United States, it
contained 8 branches, and planed to open a number of branches in the future. Funding
sources mainly relied on membership fees and course training fees, membership fees
could be paid $150 for a month or $1650 for a year. TechShop provided more than $1
million professional equipment and software, and it had comprehensive guidance of
professionals to ensure the safety of members.
2.2.3
New Type of Real Estate Model – Taking WeWork as an Example
Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey founded a service platform to provide oﬃce
space rental for small and micro enterprises, startups and free profession person in 2010
in the United States, with the operation mode of second landlord, it obtained more than
50 billion market value in a short span of four years. Wework was not real estate devel‐
opers and never did other large investment, instead it leased vacant oﬃce in American
economic depression as the second landlord identity, and made simple segmentation
and re-decoration, then rented to the number of start-up companies, also provided
leisure, entertainment and social public space for startups. Wework charged for member‐
ship fees and rents to maintain normal operation, and invited venture capital companies
and executives to come to visit and exchange from time to time, provided diﬀerent parties
for members, it expected to seek communication platform and obtain more funds coop‐
eration projects.

3.1
The Development and Reason of the China Maker Space Brand
3.1.1
Development History of the China Maker Space Brand
Li Dawei who returned from the United States established a “New workshop” maker
space in a storey house at the junction of Yongjia Road and South Shanxi road in
Shanghai with software engineer Wu Sili couples on March 25, 2011. This workshop
was the ﬁrst maker space in Shanghai even in China. After the introduction of maker to
our country, the provinces and cities created a variety of maker platforms for promoting
the integration of creativity and manufacturing. To May 2015, Beijing had more than
50 maker space, Shanghai had more than 60 maker space, Tianjin and Wuhan had 30 to
40 maker space, the development of maker space was rapid at Suzhou, Hangzhou,
Nanjing, Chengdu, Chongqing and other cities.
3.1.2
The Reason of the China Maker Space Brand Development
With the change of global industrial structure, China begun to focus on cultivating its
own brand of excellent enterprises and personnel, and tapped the public’s ability to
innovate. Many makers carried dreams, they hoped to their own creativity could be
industrialization. The development of electronic commerce and internet made people
easy access to information and resource sharing, they were diﬃcult to form a scale and
dispersed motivated by interests, this kind of folk spontaneous creativity practice was
just accorded with the Chinese government’s macro development. Chinese government
provided policy guidance and built platforms for exchange and innovation to mobilize
the power of the public, and promoted the transformation and upgrading of industrial
structure.
3.2
Three Representative Models of the China Maker Space Brand
3.2.1
Investment Driven Model – Taking Beijing Garage Coﬀee as an Example
April 7, 2011 in Zhongguancun, the world’s ﬁrst business theme cafe house was estab‐
lished on the street in Beijing. This maker space provided the most open platform for
exchanges and cooperation with the cheapest oﬃce environment for the early entrepre‐
neurial team, entrepreneurs could enjoy a free day of open oﬃce environment here with
the cost only a cup of coﬀee [6]. Garage coﬀee did not provide angel investment or
shareholding to maker team, it only provided a platform for communication and
exchange for entrepreneurs and investors. At present, the main proﬁt model of the garage
coﬀee included advertising and self media, activity venue rental, entrepreneurship
training and the normal operating income, etc.

3.2.2
The Polymerization Activity Model – Taking Shenzhen Firewood Space
as an Example
January 2015, the premier of the State Council- Li Keqiang who did a inspection in the
Shenzhen and came to Shenzhen ﬁrewood maker space [7], which ignited China maker
space boom instantly. Firewood maker space belonged to Seeed Studio Technology Co.,
Ltd., CEO- Pan hao transformed old company into a maker space initially, then he felt
the atmosphere was too depressed and moved to overseas Chinese city’s creative
industry park. The ordinary membership fee in ﬁrewood maker space was 200 yuan per
month, members could enjoy the laser cutting machine, 3D printers and other ordinary
work space. VIP membership fee was 1500 yuan per month, members could enjoy a
small CNC, engraving machine, Taiwan drilling machine and other advanced equipment
VIP work space. Firewood maker space focused on exchange and cooperation for
members, held creative projects exhibition weekly, and published business activities
party.
3.2.3
Training Guidance Model – Taking Tsinghua i-Center as an Example
Some colleges in our country setted up maker space with their advantages in hardware,
such as maker space in Tsinghua University-i.Center was transformed from based
industrial training center which was responsible for organization and coordination of
the students’ metalworking practice and teaching practice. 16500 square meters physical
space were equipped with hundreds of digital control lathes, 3D printers, laser scanners
and other infrastructure facilities for makers. In January 2013, professor Gu Xueyong
in department of industrial engineering opened “cross disciplinary system integrated
design challenge” course in i.Center maker space, students could experience skills and
practical method required in the project development process deeply and reality, it let
students understand the challenges which makers should face. In may 2014, i.Center
launched “Building a dream - the United States and China youth maker competition”
activity, the purpose was to enhance the cultural exchanges between China and the U.S.
and deepen the friendship.

Comparison and Enlightenment for the Brand Model of Maker
Space Between China and America
4.1
Comparison for the Brand Model of Maker Space Between China and
America
4.1.1
Comparison for Brand Model Target of Maker Space
The mission of many maker spaces in the United States was to provide open space and
advanced prototype processing equipment for the public, and to promote global manu‐
facturing innovation. The goal was to shorten the distance for the tourists to communi‐
cate and cooperation, and strive to save resources, protect the environment at the same
time of localization. The rising of China maker space came from government “bonus
system”, as early as September 2014, Premier Li Keqiang proposed to set oﬀ a new wave
of “public entrepreneurship”, “entrepreneurial roots” at the summer Davos forum

M. Yang

opening ceremony, formed new situation of “everyone innovation” and “peoples busi‐
ness”. Brand goal of China maker space was to comply with the requirements and the
characteristics of the network of innovation and entrepreneurship, construct the low cost
and convenience new business service platform through professional services and
market mechanism, provide work space, resources sharing space and project incubator
space for entrepreneurs, be able to provide technical funds, team building, business
counseling and other support for grassroots entrepreneurs so as to revitalize China’s
manufacturing industry.
4.1.2
Comparison for the Brand Policy of Maker Space
In June 18, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama held the ﬁrst carnival in the White
House, it aimed to foster and encourage the spirit of innovation, and achieve “the root
rejuvenation of the U.S. Manufacturing”. President Obama also announced new meas‐
ures to let more Americans who was young or old use technology and tools to live their
own lives easily. More than 13 federal government agencies and companies including
Etsy, Kickstarter, Indiegogo and local automotive manufacturers provided business
guidance, training and start-up funding for U.S. manufacturers and major retailers.
Ministry of education and other ﬁve institutions, more than 150 colleges and universities,
more than 130 libraries and large companies including Intel, Autodesk, Disney, Lego,
3D systems committed to create more maker space, and launch more students and
educators to join them. Ministry of defense, the Department of energy, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation and other 11
federal agencies provided 2 billion 500 million $ a year to ﬁnance small business inno‐
vation research (SBIR) and the small-medium enterprises technology transfer (STTR)
project. The United States Department of agriculture would launch two new competition
to encourage the agricultural technology and production of the surrounding colleges and
universities. Competition helped to promote the development of agricultural technology
and entrepreneurship, and promote food, agriculture, natural resources, rural develop‐
ment and other related issues.
In terms of maker space in our country, in March 2015, the general oﬃce of the State
Council issued “The guidance for development of maker space to promote public inno‐
vation and entrepreneurship”. The idea mainly focused on accelerating construct public
record space, promoting maker space, entrepreneurship coﬀee and innovative work‐
shops; Reducing the threshold for innovation and entrepreneurship, simplifying the
business registration process, local governments gave appropriate ﬁnancial subsidies;
encouraging scientiﬁc-technological personnel and students to entrepreneurship,
encouraging high school to open the innovation and entrepreneurship education,
increasing the training of college students; improving the venture investment and
ﬁnancing mechanism, carrying out Internet public equity ﬁnancing pilot measures etc.
China’s current rapid development of the maker space did not form a scale yet. The
integration of enterprise and university entrepreneurial team was not deep.

Comparison of the Construction for the Brand Team in Maker Space
The MIT Media Lab in Massachusetts Science Institute was founded in 1985, it belonged
to of architecture and design institute of Massachusetts Institute, it had profound attain‐
ments in the ﬁeld of transformation for achievements of science, technology, multi‐
media, including touch user interface and wearable devices. The foundation of media
lab team building was strong, there were nearly 40 senior researchers, 48 cooperative
enterprise researchers, 75 visiting scientists and post doctoral, 80 technical and admin‐
istrative personnel.There were more than 100 graduate students, these people had
diﬀerent disciplines background and work experience, while more than 200 students
worked in the laboratory through the undergraduate research opportunity program
(UROP) each year.
Beginning in 2014, “basic industrial training center” in China’s Tsinghua University
was upgraded to “i.Center”- speciﬁcally belonged to the Tsinghua people’s “maker
space”. i.Center was the world’s largest campus maker space which covered 16500
square meters, all the students in Tsinghua University should be trained with creative
thinking in this factory. They need to do a hammer, because it was a collection which
all the tools should be used in the workshop, so that students could grasp the creative
ability of the product quickly. There were a total of 107 faculties and staﬀs in Tsinghua
University basic training center, staﬀ who directly engaged in teaching were 81 people,
a professor and seven associate professors existed in 8 people. There were a large number
of high-quality experimental guidance teachers in i.Center, they communicated with the
world’s leading maker actively, and understood the forefront of the creative practice.
Including ﬁrewood space founder Pan Hao, he was hired as a maker teacher, he
exchanged the growth process of maker space with students. NoiseBridge founder
Altman Mitch and more than ten countries-outside maker talents were serve as guest
mentors in i.Center.

U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) reached a cooperation
agreement with the Department of Veterans Aﬀairs. Techshop would establish new
maker space in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Washington, DARPA’s new adaptive
vehicle manufacturing projects worked with the techshop together, made cooperation
with experimental platform for the development of advanced manufacturing technology.
At the same time, the Department of Veterans Aﬀairs and Ge Corp provided free
membership for one year and $350 worth of professional guidance and training for more
than 1200 veterans in the country. Our country maker space was based on priority policy,
the Shanghai science and Technology Committee, the Communist Youth League in
Shanghai Committee and other units started the “business Pujiang” action plan.
Shanghai maker space alliance established and initiated by nearly 40 venture service
organizations jointly would become a new incubator resource sharing, exchange and

advantages in the ﬁeld of intelligent hardware industrial, and provided entrepreneurial
projects and professional personnel.
Manufacturing Enterprise Business. Fujitsu Corporation with and the United States
Laboratory of Fujitsu and TechShop held “TechShop inside” activities together. A move
maker space was opened to children of all ages, which was equipped with many 24 foot
trailers of the prototype processing equipment, it aimed to enhance the students’ interest
and creativity in the ﬁeld of science, technology, engineering, art and Mathematics
(STEAM), advocated “learning by doing”, improved students practice activities and
access technology. At the beginning of most maker space establishment, it was non
proﬁt and aimed to manufacture DIY and share knowledge, created maker space devel‐
opment environment, provided project incubation space. Maker activity remained in the
initial stage of industrialization production and creative realization, therefore it was not
really fusion with the China manufacturing enterprise deeply.
Comparison and Analysis for the Business Model of Maker Space Between China
and America. Cooperation between our country maker space and government agencies
still stayed in policy support stage, it mainly provided incubation environment for
makers, while maker space in the United States helped and solved the military project
development and Veterans Service with the ﬁnancial assistance from government,
mutual beneﬁt and win-win formed industrial virtuous circle. United States maker space
had cooperation with Ford Motor which opened a brand maker space, established the
partnerships encouraged employees to develop new car technology by changing the
innovative environment. TechShop and Standford D.School had cooperation to open
innovation center in order to train students hands-on ability and scientiﬁc interest. In
China,maker space business development existed “entertainment” phenomenon. There‐
fore, it was an urgent problem need to be solved that how to strengthen the cooperation
business model of maker space, manufacturing enterprises and institutions of higher
learning.

4.2.1
Understanding Maker Space Brand Concept
“The godfather of maker”-MitchAltman said that although he visited diﬀerent maker
spaces around the world, Noisebridge was still his favorite. A lot of maker motions were
gathered together by “creative changed to be reality” spontaneously in the United States,
it took the maker space as a storm of the entertainment paradise. Compared with the
original intention of maker space in China and America, it could be seen that there were
still a lot of shortcomings in our country. The maker space in China after “localization”
received supports from technology companies and real estate developers, established
the entrepreneurial coﬀee shop and project incubator, it aimed to launch a better idea
and get greater commercial value. Too strong idea of starting a business bounded the
inﬁnite of creativity, so many fantastic but interesting products of foreign countries were

diﬃcult to see in the Chinese market. The future Chinese maker space development
needs market leading incubator,also need priority and pure maker space.
4.2.2
Developing a Good Maker Space Brand Team
Counting world-renowned maker space collar army brand, TechShop found by Mark
Hatch and Artisan’s Asylum found by Gui Cavalcanti could be thought in people’s mind.
We should enhance the training quality and service level, build a space brand manage‐
ment practice could not be separated from the construction and cultivation of high-
quality personnel. With the opening of our country’s business services market and policy
system, the competition of innovation and entrepreneurship was becoming more and
more intense. In this process of competition,cultivating high-quality talent team to
develop brand development strategy and seeking greater space for development were
problems that our country’s makers need to think about.
4.2.3
Improving Brand Security System of Maker Space
NoiseBridge and techshop respectively through member donations, appropriate tuition
training courses, as well as strict membership system maintained its own operations, it
solved the contradiction between expensive rent and the using of high quality hardware
for members, while our country’s maker space dependent on government subsidies
heavily. Our country should draw lessons from the successful case of the United States,
studying and formulating sustainable development of the ecological circle, providing a
basis for the development of other space with ﬂexible mode of ﬁnancing and sound
management system.

Conclusion
The spirit of maker was collaboration, open source, sharing and cooperation with the
entrepreneur to take the ideal into reality. Now the pace of global integration was accel‐
erating, the United States maker activity was rising, the maker culture in China began
to take root. China’s political environment, investment channels, the training concept
of the diﬀerent formed f a unique development model of localization maker space.
Finding the similarities and diﬀerences of maker space operation mode between China
and America through the network investigation and literature comparison method, get
the enlightenment conclusion that our country should clear maker space brand concept,
improve maker space brand system construction, cultivate outstanding maker space
talent team and improve maker space brand guarantee system. Cultivating a good envi‐
ronment for growth was conducive to the development of our country’s maker move‐
ment, promoting the innovation of China’s industrial and technological level, and
achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

Abstract. Taipei City Government and New Taipei City Government have
been actively promoting the project of “one parent-child center per district” to
provide parents and children different choices for parent-child reading. Thus,
this study aimed to explore the inﬂuences of children’s temperament and reading
environment on children’s preference regarding parent-child reading, so that
care takers can choose the most appropriate reading environment based on
children’s preference. A questionnaire survey was conducted in August, 2011
with the subjects being children aged 3 to 7. A total of 119 questionnaires were
retrieved. The questionnaire contains three parts: (1) demographic information,
(2) children’s temperament scale; and (3) parent-child reading environments and
scenarios. After ﬁeld observation, reading environments were categorized into:
(1) home: living room and bedroom; and (2) public space: exclusive reading
area, subsidiary reading area, and park. And there were 34 scenarios summa-
rized. These categories were used for further analyses. The analysis results are as
below: (1) The children of 6 different types of temperament all preferred a
bedroom at home and they loved to sit with their parent on the bed or on the
ﬂoor. In the aspect of public space, the children preferred the subsidiary reading
areas in bookstores or wholesale stores and parks. They loved to sit on a chair
and face their parent. (2) Children’s reading environment and scenario would
inﬂuence their preference regarding parent-child reading. They preferred a
reading area or a subsidiary reading area in a public space.

Introduction
The earlier a child can form his reading habit, the earlier his reading ability is devel-
oped, and the more he is able to enjoy reading (Ke 2006). This trend of developing the
reading habit earlier started in 2006, when Hsin-Yi Foundation, Cultural Affairs

Bureau, Taichung County Government, and Taipei Public Library cooperated on the
movement “Bookstart” to encourage parent-child reading, increase children’s reading
experiences, and help them to develop a habit of life-time reading. In this movement,
public libraries play a key role (Chen 2006). However, parent-child reading can be
performed not only indoors, but also outdoors as parents can use a park or a balcony as
the parent-child reading space, so that children can feel refreshed (Chen 2015). The
inﬂuence of environments on children’s reading is strong. If children can read in a good
environment, their interest in reading and the corresponding effects can be increased.
Most parents, during their school days, read only text books and nothing else. They
didn’t form a reading habit before. As a result, their expectations for their children and
the school their children go to are all about “grades”. For most parents, “reading”
equals to reading “extracurricular materials”. They don’t care about building a reading
environment for their children and helping their children to form a reading habit, so that
their children can develop the ability to explore (Chen et al. 2010). Ke (1995), a
scholar, suggested that reading comprehension covers identiﬁcation of words, meaning
extraction, sentence integration, article comprehension, meta-cognition, and reading
attitude. And reading attitude covers preferences for contents and colors of books and
reading contexts. Thus, based on the previously described background and motivations,
this study explores children’s temperament and their preferences for reading contexts,
so that their parents can understand what a proper reading environment is to help their
children form a reading habit. The main purpose of this study is to explore the inﬂu-
ences of children’s temperament and their parent-child reading environment on their
preferences regarding parent-child reading.

Literature Review
2.1
Children’s Temperament
A person’s temperament is the characteristics of his disposition. Some scholars
believed that temperament is inherent (Thomas and Chess 1977). A scholar proposed
that a person’s temperament is the presentation and response of his individual
behaviors (Martin 1988). And another scholar indicated that a person’s temperament is
the performance of his individual emotions (Chang 1989). Foreign scholars Thomas
and Chess started a long-term study from the medical viewpoint, to explore the
development and stability of children’s temperament. After continuous follow up, it
was found that the difference in temperament between early childhood and childhood
wasn’t signiﬁcant. The trend was stable. However, individual maturity and interactions
with external environments might also leads to changes in children’s temperament
(Chess and Thomas 1989). According to the previous related studies, a person’s
temperament can inﬂuence him in various ways, including his social interactions with
his peers (Wang 1995; Chou 2008; Rudasill 2011). Based on Martin’s theory (1996),
Wang (2003) modiﬁed the child temperament scale used abroad to develop a model for
children aged 5 to 6 in Taiwan. In this model, there are 6 temperament dimensions,
including distractibility, emotion intensity, approach or withdrawal, activity level,
adaptability, and persistence. The validity and reliability of the child temperament scale
330
J.-H. Chang and T.-L. Yeh

modiﬁed by Wang (1995) were very good. Then, based on the combinations of the
temperament dimensions, Wang (2003) proposed 6 major types of temperament,
including being concentrated, being quiet, being ordinary, being energetic, being
social, and being free. Table 1 shows the characteristics of these temperament types
based on the above-mentioned dimensions. This study adopted the child temperament
scale modiﬁed by Wang as the research tool.
2.2
Context
Schools are the ﬁrst unit children ever learn about socialization. Thus, in terms of
promoting children’s reading, besides home, school learning environments are also
essential. Other than at home, children can also read in a library (Lin 2002; Yen 2002).
The research by Von Sprecken and Krashen (1988) with the students from the reading
courses found that if books are easy to access, 90 % of children would choose to read.
In a reading area, placing some soft materials such as mats, carpets, and bolsters and a
lot of books and making the environment warm with decorations can help increase
children’s willingness to enter this area (Huang 2004; Lo 2005; Yen 2008; Liao 2011).
Furthermore, good lighting helps to increase motivations to read, as children can be
more concentrated, and their reading effects can be improved (Shiao 1995).
• Parent-Child Reading Space
According to the previous description, children need a rich collection of books and
warm reading atmosphere for reading. It would be even better if there can be an
exclusive reading space (corner) for children. Setting up a reading corner can not
only motivate children to read, but also help them to form a reading habit. A reading
corner should be set up within the range of children’s activities, such as a study
room or a place next to the bed in a bedroom at home and the children’s reading
area in a library or a bookstore. In cases such as having an outing, some children’s
books can be brought alone in order to build an environment where books which
can be accessed conveniently, so that children’s reading habit and attitude can be
developed easily (Wan 2013).
• Furniture for Parent-Child Reading
When reading, children can hardly sit upright in the same place for a long time.
Thus, it is important that the furniture used for parent-child reading must be able to
attract children, of the proper size, and with many variations. When children read on

the ﬂoor, some mats, soft cushions, and bolsters can not only offer them support but
also keep them safe. When children read in a place like a living room, a study room,
or a library, a sofa or a set of classroom table and chair can be considered based on
the reading atmosphere. During the time for a bed time story, a cozy bed and a
pillow can help to create warm and comfortable atmosphere and improve the
interactions and intimacy between parents and children (Wan 2013).

Research Methods
The research methods adopted include the questionnaire survey method and statistical
methods. After considering the interactions between children and their caretakers and
their ability to understand the content of the books for parent-child reading, this study
decided to issue the questionnaires to the caretakers of children at pre-school age
(children at 3–7 years).
3.1
Questionnaire Survey
1. Questionnaire Design
The questionnaire contains three parts, basic information, child temperament scale, and
parent-child reading contexts.
• Basic information: The items in this part include gender and age of the child and his
caretaker as well as the relationship between them.
• Child temperament scale: This study focused on the children of ordinary temper-
ament. Thus, the “Child Temperament Scale” developed by Lin, Tung, and Wang
from National Taiwan Normal University based on the scale proposed by R.
P. Martin from the University of Georgia, USA was used. This scale is for children
of 3–7 years. There are 48 items in total. They are categorized into 6 categories:
activity level, adaptability, emotion intensity, distractibility, approach or with-
drawal, and persistence. Each category contains both positively and negatively
worded items. The assessments are based on the Likert 7-point scaling. After the
assessments, children can be classiﬁed into 6 categories: children of ordinary,
social, concentrated, free, energetic, and quiet temperament (Wang 2006).
• Parent-child reading contexts: According to the literature, this study made some
assumptions regarding parent-child reading contexts with parents and children in
different spaces with different relative positions (Fig. 1). The assumed contexts
include home spaces and public spaces. Home spaces include a living room (or a
study room) and a bedroom. Public spaces include an exclusive reading area (in a
library or a public childcare center), a subsidiary reading area (in a bookstore or a
hypermarket), and a park (open space). Each of them is represented by a capital
letter. For every space, there are cases with and without furniture (chairs or a bed).
Each case is represented by a lowercase letter. The parent-child relative positions
include the child sitting in the parent’s arms, the child sitting next to the parent, the
child sitting opposite to the parent, and the child sitting 90 degrees to the parent.
332
J.-H. Chang and T.-L. Yeh

Each relative position is represented by a number. Table 2 shows an example. After
excluding the contexts which are less likely to happen due to space limitations,
there are a total of 34 parent-child reading contexts. The Likert 5-point scaling was
used for assessments, with 5 options: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and
strongly disagree. The participants were asked to answer the questions based on
their previous parent-child reading experiences.

Conclusion and Discussion
5.1
Child Temperament Preferences
According to the statistical analysis results, among the home spaces, the children of the
6 different types of temperament all preferred to read in a bedroom. They liked to sit on
the ﬂoor or the bed with their parent. Among the public spaces, the children preferred
the reading area in a bookstore or a hypermarket or a park. They liked to sit on a chair
opposite to their parent’s seat. The descriptive statistics showed that the energetic
children’s preference for parent-child reading environments was signiﬁcant, while the
preference of the children of all the other temperament was not. The research subjects
of this study were pre-school children aged 3–7. The differences among the children of
different types of temperament weren’t signiﬁcant. They hadn’t yet been inﬂuenced by
interactions from environments. The differences in the preference for a parent-child
reading environment among the children of different types of temperament were small.
These ﬁndings are consistent with what the study by Thomas and Chess had found.
Future studies can focus on children aged 7 or above, as the differences in reading
preferences among children of different types of temperament in this age group may be
more signiﬁcant due to the inﬂuences of their maturity and environmental factors.
5.2
Parent-Child Reading Space Preferences
The most common parent-child reading space was a space at home, followed by an
exclusive reading area in a library or a public childcare center. Similar to the ﬁndings of
the two previously mentioned scholars (Lin 2002; Yen 2002), parent-child reading has
become a common practice. Children prefer subsidiary reading areas in bookstores and
hypermarkets. To create a reading space, besides making it comfortable, if books in
that space are easy to access, 90 % of children would read in that space (Von Sprecken
and Krashen 1988). This way, it would be easier to help children form a reading habit
and improve their reading attitude.

Abstract. This study mainly investigates the inﬂuence of different media pre-
sentation forms on viewers’ perception, preference, and viewing time. This study
enrolled 15 male and 15 female subjects to participate in the experiment. The
independent variables included gender (male and female) and media forms of
paintings. The media forms included four factors: original paintings, planar pre-
sentation of paintings, screen presentation of paintings, and picture book of
paintings. The experimental results showed that, the gender factor did not have
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on all the measurement variables. Media forms had signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence on 4 indices; “viewing paintings arbitrarily,” “paintings reﬂected a
sense of value,” “preference for paintings,” and “viewing time” (p < 0.05).
According to the research results of this study, the sense of value reﬂected by
original paintings was the highest, and they were most preferred by viewers. It is
advised to provide proper painting titles and good viewing environment during
exhibition of paintings to help viewers develop pleasant emotions and further
increase their preference for paintings.

Introduction
From the point of ergonomics, the human performance and preference would be affected
by media form. For text reading task, Mayes et al. (2001) show that subjects take longer
to read text on a screen than on paper. As for accuracy, Egan et al. (1989) report that
students using digital hypertext on a screen to ﬁnd out speciﬁc information in the text
had higher accuracy than students using the paper text. For reading comprehension,
Dillon and Gabbard (1998) conclude that comprehension when reading from a screen is
better than reading from paper when performing substantial searching or manipulation
and comparison of visual details among objects. However, Cushman (1986) ﬁnds that

visual fatigue is signiﬁcantly higher with when reading black objects on a white screen
background than reading paper. In addition, Martin and Platt (2001) also found that the
medical school students still prefer to read from paper rather than from a screen.
Moreover, the better image quality of display could improve visual task perfor-
mance and reduce visual fatigue. Menozzi et al. (2001) reported that using liquid
crystal display (LCD) caused fewer errors in visual search tasks than using cathode ray
tube (CRT) display. Wang and Huang (2004) also found that using LCD display for
after etching inspection (AEI) showed less eye fatigue and better accuracy than using
CRT display. This is due to the better image quality and higher refresh rate of the
TFT-LCD display. Further, Takahashi (2006) compared the display effect on visual
acuity after one-hundred minutes TV program watching, and found that watching LCD
display had a signiﬁcantly higher decrease in visual acuity than that of watching plasma
display. The behavior of TV program watching is different from TV game playing, and
the users tend to have higher motivation, attention and concentration on video game
playing. However, information about the evaluation of a plasma display and CRT
display for video game playing on visual fatigue and mental workload is lacking. For
visuospatial task, Van Orden and Broyles (2000) compared the visuospatial task per-
formance of participants who used seven types of two-dimensional (2-D) and
three-dimensional (3-D) displays. The authors reported that, overall, the task perfor-
mance of participants who used the 2-D plan, or side-view, display type was more
favorable than the task performance of participants who used any other display system,
but the 3-D volumetric display type was more suitable for participants performing
integration and prediction tasks in a limited 3-D space.
However, previous studies did not consider whether the human behavior and
preference of the painting watching would be similar to that of the functional visual
task. This study mainly investigates the inﬂuence of different media presentation forms
on viewers’ perception, preference, and viewing time while watching a painting.

Methods
2.1
Subjects
This study enrolled 15 male and 15 female subjects to participate in the experiment.
The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 40 years (mean = 23.23, SD = 4.41).
The mean age of male participants was 22.20 (SD = 3.85) years. The mean age of
female participants was 24.27 (SD = 4.71) years.
2.2
Experimental Design
The independent variables included gender (male and female) and media forms of
paintings. The media forms included 4 factors: original paintings, planar presentation of
paintings, screen presentation of paintings, and picture book of paintings. For original
paintings, this study used 21 pieces of oil paintings of Ms. Li, a novice painter who had
learned painting for 5 years, as the experimental samples; 9 of the paintings were
landscape paintings, and 12 were abstract paintings, and all of the paintings were

displayed in frames of the same style (as shown in Fig. 1). Regarding the planar pre-
sentation of paintings, 21 original paintings pieces were scanned into electronic image
ﬁles using the scanner (CRUSE-CS185ST 1100), which were output into planar images
of A1 size (84.1 cm * 59.4 cm) using the HP designjet 5000. Afterwards, they were
displayed in the same aluminum frames (as shown in Fig. 2). Regarding the screen
presentation of paintings, the electronic image ﬁles of paintings were converted into a
brieﬁng ﬁle, and presented using a 37-inch LCD TV (Panasonic TC-37MPJ), as shown
in Fig. 3. Regarding the picture book of paintings, the paintings were bound in a picture
book with a spread page size of 60 cm * 30 cm. Each painting piece was presented on a

spread page and a partial enlarged view on another spread page. Therefore, the picture
book included 21 paintings pieces, and 84 pages in total (as shown in Fig. 4).
There were two measuring variables in this study: one was the questionnaire survey
on subjective perception, and the other was the record of viewing behavior. The
questionnaire included basic information (gender, age, and the highest level of educa-
tion) and the scale on painting viewing experience (6 items on the perception of the
viewing process and 5 items on evaluation of paintings). The latter used a 5-point scale
for scoring, where 1 denoted strongly disagree, 2 denoted disagree, 3 denoted neutral, 4
denoted agree, and 5 denoted strongly agree. Moreover, in order to evaluate viewing
behavior, this study concurrently used a stopwatch to record the time spent viewing the
21 painting pieces by the subjects.
2.3
Experimental Procedure
The experimental sites of this study were the exhibition space and ofﬁce. The original
pieces of paintings and planar presentation of paintings were displayed in an exhibition
space, while a screen presentation of paintings and the picture book of paintings were
viewed in the ofﬁce. Every subject was randomized to determine their order of exper-
imental combination. The subjects could adjust the time spent viewing each piece of
painting according to their preference. During the appreciation of original paintings or
planar presentation of paintings, the subjects had to walk around in the exhibition space.
When reading the picture book, the subjects had to turn the pages with their hands.
When watching the screen, the subjects had to hold the wireless presenter (Logitech
R400) and press “Page Up” and “Page Down” buttons to present the paintings. After
viewing the 21 pieces of paintings, the subjects recorded the viewing time and com-
pleted the questionnaire. Afterwards, the subjects viewed the paintings under another
experimental condition. The subjects only received two experimental combinations each
time, and received the other two experimental combinations one week later.

Results
The analysis of variance results in Table 1 reveal that the gender factor did not have
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on all the measurement variables, suggesting that the opinions on
issues and viewing behaviors between male and female subjects were the same. Media
forms had signiﬁcant inﬂuence on 4 indices; “viewing paintings arbitrarily” (p < .05),
“paintings reﬂected a sense of value” (p < .01), “preference for paintings” (p < .05),
and “viewing time” (p < .001).
The Duncan grouping results indicate that the “viewing paintings arbitrarily” for
the four media forms can be classiﬁed into two groups. The ﬁrst group, with the higher
scores was for original painting and planar painting. The second group, with the lower
scores was for screen painting and book painting. As can be seen in the table, the
average “viewing paintings arbitrarily” scores for the original painting and planar
painting is 4.43 and 4.40, respectively; the scores for the screen painting and book
painting is 3.97 and 4.10, respectively. In other words, the original painting and planar
342

painting score is about 0.5 higher than that for the screen painting and book painting.
The Duncan grouping results indicate that the “paintings reﬂected a sense of value” for
the four media forms can be classiﬁed into three groups. The ﬁrst group, with the
highest score was for original painting, followed by screen painting, book painting and
planar painting. The original painting score is about 0.8 higher than that for the planar
painting. The Duncan grouping results indicate that the “preference for paintings” for
the four media forms can be classiﬁed into two groups. The ﬁrst group, with the higher
scores was for original painting. The second group, with the lower scores was for
screen painting, planar painting and book painting. The Duncan grouping results
indicate that the “viewing time” for the four media forms can be classiﬁed into three
groups. The ﬁrst group, with the longest time was for book painting, followed by

original painting, planar painting and screen painting. The viewing time for the screen
painting is about 55 % shorter than that of the book painting.
The present results provide evidence that the media form affects some painting
viewing experience and viewing behavior. The painting value was substantially
decreased under the planar painting compared with that the original painting. In
addition, viewing time was greatest when participants watch the book painting than
when they watch the other three painting forms.

Conclusion
According to the research results of this study, the sense of value reﬂected by original
paintings was the highest, and they were most preferred by viewers. It is advised to
provide proper painting titles and good viewing environment during exhibition of
paintings to help viewers develop pleasant emotions and further increase their pref-
erence for paintings.

Abstract. “Idyllic”, which literally means a quality suggestive of the poetic and
picturesque, is used as the criterion with which to evaluate a Chinese painting.
For living space, the product should also ﬁt into a context of living environment
and meet user requirements. Idyllic describes the arts striving toward perfection,
beauty and reﬁnement in all aspects of life. Transforming “idyllic” into “living
space” involves more than considering the interior design itself. It remains a
challenge to represent use contexts and user needs in a way that designers with
technical backgrounds are able to make direct use of them. When designing “arts”
into “business”, we need a better understanding of human-art interaction not just
for taking part in the humanity context, but also for developing the interactive
experience of arts. Therefore, a general framework is proposed for interior design
that applies to representing human-art interactions and translating aesthetics into
user requirements in an interior design case. The intended purpose of this paper
is to provide a framework for examining the way designers interact across the art
and interactive experiences of users in the design process.

Introduction
In an era emphasizing aesthetics experience, both the developed countries with mature
economic and cultural development and the newly emerging countries which try to break
through the industry positioning aggressively have all sensed that cultural creativity can
increase the entire economic growth, enhance industry competitiveness, inherit cultural
assets and create high added value in the country’s image. Many international enter‐
prises, in this trend of industry transformation, have devoted themselves to the guidance
of local culture the global market (Chang et al. 2013). In the global market - local design
era, connections between arts and aesthetic design have become increasingly close. For
local design, culture and arts value-adding creates the core of local design value. It’s the
same for the global market; local design is the motivation for pushing culture and arts

forward in global market development (Lin and Chen 2012). When we think about
“globalization” we must think “localization” for the market (Lin 2011).
Multiple studies in the areas of cross-cultural behavioral and cognitive psychology
continue to uncover signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the way people behave, think, assign value,
and engage others (Lin 2007, 2009, 2011). Understanding culture and cross-cultural
behavioral is thus vital in the design ﬁeld. “Culture” plays an important role in the design
ﬁeld, and “cross cultural design” will be a key design evaluation point in the future.
Designing “culture” into modern products will be a design trend in the global market.
Obviously, we need a better understanding of cross-cultural communication not only
for the global market, but also for local design. While cross-cultural factors become
important issues for product design in the global economy, the intersection of design
and culture becomes a key issue making both local design and the global market worthy
of further in-depth study (Lin 2007).
Despite the recognized importance of aesthetic design in cultural and creative design
industries, they lack a systematic approach to it (Monk and Lelos 2007). Obviously, we
need a better understanding of human-arts communications not only for the global
market, but also for local design. While cross-cultural issues become important for
product design in the global economy, the intersection of design and culture becomes a
key issue making both local design and the global market worthy of further in-depth
study (Lin and Lin 2010). Therefore, this study focuses on the analysis of art works in
which the aesthetic elements are used. Then, a framework is proposed to provide
designers with a valuable reference for designing a successful cultural product (Smyth
and Wallace 2000). Results presented herein create an interface for examining the way
designers communicate across art work as well as the interwoven experience of incor‐
porating design and aesthetics into the design process.

Framework for Turning “Art Work” into “Interior Design”
Based on Lin’s studies (Chen et al. 2014, 2015), turning poetry into painting involves
complex issues that are interdisciplinary in nature. The issues are with nature: it appears
to be suitable for “reading” in diﬀerent ways, and multiple perspectives are available by
analyzing them. A research framework was proposed as shown in Fig. 1 – this is used
in a continuous search for a deeper understanding of the nature of turning poetry into
painting, and for which some conjectures can be tested. Some of the outstanding notes
state here. (1) Signiﬁcance: the art work and interior design can express a kind of
signiﬁcance; that is, the designer’s intentions can indeed be expressed through the art
work and interior design. (2) Expression: Interior design may represent the poet and
artist’s feelings; through the art works, the artist’s imaginations, thoughts, and feelings
can be reproduced. Designers can express through artwork for Idyllic style to turn into
the interior space presented. (3) Communication: the results of signiﬁcation and expres‐
sion can be sent to the viewer only when the Interior Designer and the viewer’s thoughts
are identical (Fiske 2013; Norman 2004).

It is worthy of our curiosity - How do artists express themselves through “Poetry”
and how do they create landscapes, poetry, lyrics, or drawings through “Painting.”
Professor Lin’s study (Lin 2007, 2009, 2011; Lin and Chen 2012; Lin and Lin 2010),
described a research framework combining communication theory with communication
and mental models. The framework was proposed to explore the issue of turning poetry
into painting as shown in Fig. 1. An artist (addresser) sends a message to an audience
(addressee) through his/her artwork, through the analysis of the four constitutive factors
context (referential), message (poetic), code (metalingual), contact (phatic). Norman
(2004) proposed three levels of processing: visceral, behavioral and reﬂective.
Fig. 2. Research framework for turning poetry into painting (Lin’s teaching materials 2016)
From “Idyllic” to “Living Space”
347

This communication model is for turning poetry into painting. Thus, when a designer
designs a product for a user, the designer expects that the user will understand and use
it in the desired way; the designer should understand the use’s mental model as Shown
in Fig. 2. According to this model a research framework can be created for turning poetry
into painting.
From the cognitive models and the identiﬁcation phase of Fig. 2, art and design
features are identiﬁed from an original art work including the outer-level of colors,
texture, and pattern. The mid-level consists of function, usability, and safety. The inner-
level consists of emotion, symbolic meaning, and stories. The designer uses the scientiﬁc
method and other methods of inquiry and hence is able to obtain, evaluate, and utilize
art information from the art work (Lin 2007). The designer achieves some depth and
experience of practice in these art features and at the same time is able to relate the art
elements to design problems in modern society. This produces an appreciation for the
interaction between arts, technology, and society (Lin 2007). It expresses the art
elements that are associated with the artistic features, the meaning of the chosen art
work, the aesthetic sensibilities, and the ﬂexibility to adapt to various designs. Good use
can be made of it in design practice by converting artwork into interior design products.
Thus, in the deep design space of Poetry and Painting, how designers turn the poetic
mood into living space and how “Art Work” is turned in “Interior Design are worthy of
study and practice and may be based on the above theoretical basis and practical methods
(Chen et al. 2014, 2015).
“Poetry” comes from “Painting,” “Painting” displays “Poetry,” “Poetry” overﬂows
in “Painting,” and “Painting” surpasses “Poetry.” “Idyllic” is commonly used to describe
the beauty of natural landscape and the mood of paintings. The idiom of the “Idyllic”
( , shi-qing-hua-yi), which literally means the quality of poetry and picturesque,
is used as the criterion with which to evaluate a painting (Yeh and Lin 2014; Yeh et al.
2014). Developing an aesthetic product such as “Idyllic style”, involves more than
considering the “culture” or “art work.” Based on the word “Idyllic”, the aesthetic
product or “Idyllic style” should also ﬁt into a context of “art work” or cultural meaning
in use and meet the users’ requirements. The above framework is used as an approach
to explore “Idyllic” art work and translate it into user needs and user requirements in
aesthetic products or interior design cases. Based on the above theory, cognitive mode
and cultural art can be transformed from three levels: outer-level, mid-level and inner-
level as shown in Fig. 3. The Fig. 3 framework illustrates how to transform “Art work”
into “Interior Design” with the Idyllic style. The outer-level has to express the decorative
surface of interior Design through idyllic color, pattern and form. The mid-level has to
express the furnishings of interior Design through idyllic elements and idyllic structure.
The inner-level has to express the imaginative space through idyllic reconstruction and
idyllic imagery.

A Case Study of Turning “Idyllic” to “Living Space”
Based on Lin’s research (Chen et al. 2014, 2015), after the experimental analysis of the
results during the exhibition, the painting entitled “Reﬂected Sunlight and Cloud
Shadow Lingered Over and Over” as shown in the right at Fig. 4 was chosen from a
painting exhibition (at the left of Fig. 4).
Fig. 4. Exhibition for turning poetry into painting
This poem comes from the Southern Song Dynasty poet Zhu Xi’s concept of “The
Book”. Professor Xu Yuanchong (Xu 1997) translates and decodes for the poet:
There lies a glassy oblong pool. (	
)
Where light and shade pursue their course. ()
How can it be so clear and cool? (?)
For water fresh comes from its source. ( )
From “Idyllic” to “Living Space”
349

The poet describes the pond as a mirror reﬂection of the sky and the shadow of the
clouds and the reﬂection ﬂoating and dripping in the water. People often use the meta‐
phor to keep learning new knowledge, and to reach new heights. People like to use Zhu
Xi’s poem to praise a person’s knowledge or artistic achievement, which has a deeper
deﬁnition to its originality. We can also learn from this poem that, only thoughts were
inspired by enlightened forever activity and a broad mind, to accept a variety of diﬀerent
ideas such as fresh knowledge. Thus, one can fully understand poetry and paintings in
the background, using the above theoretical framework – from “Idyllic” to “Living
Space”. The framework explains the expression through three levels: the ﬁrst level is
outer-level, the second level is mid-level, and the third level is inner-level.
3.1
Turning “Art Work” into “Interior Design” from the Outer- Level
The Outer-level can be a very direct experience to present its tangible element. It is a
direct manifestation of visual and morphological aspects combined with the conversion
mode for color, texture, pattern conversion, and analysis and poetry paintings in the
scenic description. It can pick up color paintings and graphics for design conversion
purposes. Based on the Outer-level theoretical study (Chen et al. 2014, 2015), the anal‐
ysis of color, texture and pattern can be directly converted to designing color or patterns
for interior design spaces such as indoor decorative paints, wallpaper, decorative mate‐
rials, decoration, as well as carpets, curtains, lamps and other soft furnishings installed.
The analysis of “Reﬂected Sunlight and Cloud Shadow Lingered Over and Over”
painting, the sky and clouds reﬂected on the water surface. Create an image and pattern
from this painting, used as decorative pattern in interior design. The patterns of the
painting directly used for indoor curtain, shown in Fig. 5. Additionally, the paintings

can still be used as home fabric patterns and colors as well as presenting other patterns
in lamp shade design. In summary, the method of extraction and pattern painting color
analysis is a direct quote, and it is a direct manifestation of “poetic” in the “outer-level”
(Lin 2007, 2009, 2011).
3.2
Turning “Art Work” into “Interior Design” from the Mid-Level
In fact, the mid-level is Function. It considers the usage do conversion. The main
concerns are: functional properties, artiﬁcial function, the use of performance, function
combined with other attributes, the poetic combination of pictorial integration of indoor
space, using “sky clouds hover” poetry paintings as the basis for giving full consideration
to the reasonable function, human factors design, functionality and performance to
achieve multi-purpose conversion, dynamic and static optimization and so on. There‐
fore, in the study of space on a desk design would be reﬂected according to the “Art
Work” to ﬁnd the rule, the elements and structures applied to the design as shown in
Fig. 6. Curved lines from the “Reﬂected sunlight and cloud shadow lingered over and
over” form the design elements for a movable, sliding cabinet which can be slid around
to change the use of the space. This maximizes function, easy to use to provide a reason‐
able performance(Chen et al. 2014, 2015).

3.3
Turning “Art Work” into “Interior Design” from the Inner-Level
When product safety and comfort have been satisﬁed, emphasis can shift toward the
decorative, emotional, and symbolic attributes of design (Crilly et al. 2004).
From “Idyllic” to “Living Space”
351

The successful product design meets or exceeds the emotional needs of users beyond
utility and quality. Incorporating “feeling” into product design to present the emotional
communication of user experiences has become a design trend of the twenty ﬁrst century,
according to McLoone et al. (2012).
If the “outer-level” is the direct experience and performance, “performance level”
is a function of the use and eﬀectiveness, and therefore, “spiritual level” is a profound
meaning and emotion. When the soul level converses, it pays more attention to contex‐
tual sense, story, moral, cultural traits, and feelings that carry other attributes. The
implementation phase is shown in Fig. 7. Although the idea expressed the structure of
Idyllic Style composition, it was too complicated to express the inner meaning of Idyllic
Style composition. Through the analysis of “Reﬂected sunlight and cloud shadow
lingered over and over”, a mirror material was chosen to simulate the skylight and
surface reﬂection, in order to increase and highlight the artistic conception of “Reﬂected
sunlight and cloud shadow lingered over and over”. For the user who likes to collect
arts and crafts, the open cabinets serve as display as well as storage. The ﬁnal “Memory”
closet is shown in Fig. 7.

Summary
With the development of society and the improvement of living standards, cultural and
creative industries have developed well in recent years. How to turn “Arts” into “Busi‐
ness” for “Creativity” and “Design”, and E-business for creative industries are important
352
Y.-J. Gao et al.

research issues. Those issues have not been well covered until now. Therefore, based
on the e-business, this paper proposes a research framework for illustrating how to
transform “artwork” into “e-business”, and “Idyllic Style” into “Interior Design”, and
design these aesthetic features into modern products to reinforce their business value.
The most important part of this framework is of value for designers because it can help
to design “art elements” and “art Style” into aesthetic design.
In the study of methods and tools, Idyllic style converses the design methods and
models by using qualitative analysis to investigate the conversion process of literature
theory and case study analysis. Through the case study, ﬁrstly, to understanding the
poetic literature and paintings express of cultural background, provide model and theory
for the design; secondly, the establishment of solid steps to convert the design to provide
the actual conversion cases, this is to further improve the transformation of “Idyllic
Style” space into the possibilities of the business model design. The third, case-by-case
basis – to establish “Idyllic Style” space design conversion mode, from cultural creation
poetry to paintings in living interior design, is to extend beyond the purposes and
contexts of “Idyllic Style” in time and space value within this research.
For future studies, we need a better understanding of the local culture and design
where changes in consumer perception regarding aesthetics are also important in design.
We also need a better understanding of user need in the global market. Therefore, how
to establish a local culture into the business model and artistic transformation becomes
a key issue in cultural product design and creative industry and worthy of further
in-depth study.

Abstract. The purpose of this study is to explore the meaning of cultural objects
and to extract their cultural features from Taiwan’s aboriginal culture. This paper
attempts to illustrate how by enhancing the original meaning and images of
Taiwan aboriginal culture features and by taking advantage of new production
technology, they may be transformed into modern products and so fulﬁll the needs
of the contemporary consumer market. The gungu, literally “weaving box”, in
the Atayal aboriginal language, was chosen as the cultural object for this study.
The paper focuses on and analyzes the weaving box’s appearance, usability,
cultural meaning, operational interface, and the scenario in which it is used. Then,
this article intends to create an interface for examining the way designers commu‐
nicate across cultures as well as the interwoven experience of design and culture
in the design process.

Introduction
Designing local features into products appears to be more and more important in the
global market where products are losing their identity because of similarities in tech‐
nology, function, and form. Cultural features then are considered to be unique characters
to embed into a product both for the enhancement of its identity in the global market
and for the fulﬁlment of the individual consumer’s experiences (Hsu et al. 2013). Using
local features in design ﬁelds as a strategy to create product identity in the global market,
the designer has noted the importance of associating products with cultural features in
order to enhance product value (Lin 2009). At this point, the ﬁeld of Industrial Design
has played an important role in embedding cultural elements into products and in
increasing cultural value in the global competitive product market. Therefore, designing
a product with local features in order to emphasize its cultural value has become a critical
issue in the design process (Hsu et al. 2011).

Culture plays an important role in the design ﬁeld, and cross-cultural design will be
a key design evaluation point in the future. Designing “culture” into products will be a
design trend in the global market. Obviously, we need a better understanding of cross-
cultural communications not only for the global market, but also for local design. While
cross-cultural issues become important for product design in the global economy, the
intersection of design and culture becomes a key issue making both local design and the
global market worthy of further in-depth study (Lin et al. 2009). The importance of
studying culture is shown repeatedly in several studies in all areas of technology design.
In the global market - local design era, connections between culture and design have
become increasingly close. For design, cultural value-adding creates the core of product
value. It’s the same for culture; design is the motivation for pushing cultural develop‐
ment forward. Therefore, based on the “Taiwan Experience”, the purpose of this paper
is to study how to transfer “cultural features” to design elements, and design “cross
culture” into cultural products to reinforce their design value (Lin and Lin 2010). This
paper has established a cross-cultural design model to provide designers with a valuable
reference for designing a successful cultural product. Results presented herein create an
interface for examining the way designers communicate across cultures as well as the
interwoven experience of design and culture in the design process (Lin 2007).

The Collector as a Consumer
A successful consumer product is perhaps the most diﬃcult of human use products to
design. A successful product means that enough are purchased and at a price to return
a suﬃcient and timely proﬁt to its manufacturer. Unlike the bespoke tailor or shoemaker
who designs for a particular person, the consumer product designer is greatly handi‐
capped by knowing little about the users for whom he is designing (and will likely never
see) except perhaps in a statistical way. And any consumer statistic varies greatly among
potential users especially in the international market.
Furthermore, unlike designing for users of industrial, military, aviation, or medical
products, the designer of a consumer product faces perhaps the ultimate challenge: the
consumer has the option of choice especially in a competitive market. A consumer need
not purchase the designer’s product. And even if purchased, the product need not be
used resulting in lack of repurchase sales or bad word-of-mouth publicity. And even if
used it may not be used correctly nor safely, nor maintained correctly or at all if such is
required, etc., all with similar negative impacts on future sales.
The basic anthropometric and physiological variables determine the goodness of
“ﬁt” of the product to the user or the ability to use it “correctly” (i.e., safely and func‐
tionally as the designer intended). The human body has deﬁnite limitations in sizes,
ranges, preferred direction of motions, etc. The magnitude of the diﬃculty in designing
a successful consumer product becomes clearer as consumer variation in those psycho‐
logical and aesthetic factors which critically aﬀect purchase are added to the “goodness
of ﬁt” variables (Lin and Kreifeldt 2001).
The architect Louis Sullivan’s dictum that “form follows function” is largely true if
“function” is carefully determined and “form” implemented thoughtfully to “fit” the body.
356
J. Kreifeldt et al.

The form can then be both physically and to some extent aesthetically pleasing because it
conforms to the human body rather than depending upon the body to conform to it (Moore
1992). The well-known adaptability of the human is both a benefit and drawback in design
in as much as it may be depended upon too much by the designer. Likewise, the early
Industrial Designer Dreyfuss (1984, 2012) rejected the speculative design of external form
alone as irrelevant. He believed that fitting machines to the users would be most efficient.
Focus groups, interviews, questionnaires and such are techniques for trying to determine
consumer likes/dislikes and preferences. Psycho-statistical techniques such as Multidimen‐
sional Scaling (MDS) and its relatives are further aides (Lutz and Ramsey 1974). While
these have proven to be of help, it is rare that consumers can articulate their aesthetic pref‐
erences in a way useful for designers.
Consumers are usually unable to verbalize the correct reasons why they like and
dislike a product which can then easily lead the designer astray. For example, the user
swinging golf clubs to test them may have a strong preference for the “feel” of one versus
the others or may want “more” of that particular “feel”. The designer must deal with its
physical attributes but the user is largely unable to verbalize what he means by “feel”
or what the preferred one has that the others do not in words helpful to the designer.
This is because the “feel” of the club is strongly related to its moment-of-inertia (I)
which, although clearly perceptible, is a term and even concept unknown to users and
even to some designers (Kreifeldt et al. 2011).
The aesthetic response of potential consumers has become a driving factor in product
design. However, designers are even more handicapped because of the consumers’
inability to verbalize their aesthetic preferences clearly and in design useful manner
(Norman 2004). In terms of paint, canvas, frame and labour, a painting as a product
would cost little. Yet a collector is willing to pay an amount for it that far exceeds its
nominal value. So the design question becomes: why? The collector as consumer may
provide design useful insights into purposeful aesthetic design (Kreifeldt et al. 2011;
Kaplan 2004). Towards this end, aesthetic response is explored here via a particular
Western person’s reaction to a seemingly simple user “product” – a gungu - designed
Fig. 1. A gungu designed as a weaving as practice tool (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014)

long ago for the art of weaving as practiced by Taiwan’s aboriginal Atayal weavers as
shown in Fig. 1.
3
What Do You See in that Old Thing?
The Atayal weaver used a primitive type of loom sometimes called a “backstrap” or
“back tension” loom. This apparatus is a type also found in many cultures particularly
in South East Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Although “primitive”, it
permitted complex patterns of considerable beauty to be woven (Varutti 2015).
To use the loom, the weaver braced her feet against the gungu around which the
continuous warp threads passed completing their circuit around the breast beam held
near her body by a strap fastened at each end and passing behind her back: hence the
name “backstrap”. The weaver would alternately tighten and loosen the warp threads as
part of the weaving process. She did this by pushing with her feet against the box creating
a strain against the strap against her back to tighten the thread tension as she “beat” a
new weft (cross) thread down and then relaxed to loosen the tension so that she could
insert the next weft thread as shown in Fig. 2. She continued this basic process until the
weaving was completed (Chang et al. 2008).
Fig. 2. Backstrap used in weaving process (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014)
The ﬁrst view the collector had of such a box or even knew of its existence or purpose
was in a small village town in Taiwan. The box was sitting on the ﬂoor of a modern
Atayal weaver’s shop and the collector described it as “leaping up” and speaking directly
to his collector’s soul. It appeared to him as a sculptural object with a rich golden, honey-
brown patina from generations of bare feet pressing and rubbing against it.
To a collector, “weaving box” hardly gives an adequate picture of that object. In cold
technical terms it was of wood and about 1½ shoulder widths wide with a sort of trian‐
gular cross section having smoothly rounded corners to facilitate the passage of the warp
threads around it. The base was about 12” wide and tapered upward perhaps 14” to a
smoothly rounded top which had a slit opening wide enough to admit the various sticks,
shuttle, beater, backstrap and other weaving apparatus for storage as well as the weaving
in progress (See Fig. 2). The hollow construction with the slit in the top made it also
function as a resonant cavity. In the old days of head-taking the gungu was beat like a
drum to raise an alarm or when a man brought a head back to the village to bring good
fortune after some unwanted occurrence such as crop failure (Chang et al. 2008).
358
J. Kreifeldt et al.

The weaver did not want to sell the box because it was part of her family heirlooms
which was perfectly understandable and correct. Too many cultural items – material
manifestations of the culture and examples by which it may be studied - have been lost
or left their homes into museums and private collections. The only arguments collectors
can oﬀer are that such objects will be cherished, cared for, and preserved against the
very real possibility that left in situ they might be forever lost. Moreover, such objects
can foster wider interest in cultures which may be losing the ﬁght against the trans‐
forming forces and pressures of societal evolution toward a secular rather than a spiritual
society (Varutti 2015).
A wise man of the famous Iban weaving people in Borneo said that a society which
is moving forward without spiritual fulﬁlment is paving the way for its own self-
destruction and extinction. The artifacts of a culture are its external expression. Modern
products need a connection with a spiritual foundation. And a culture must ﬁnd its spiri‐
tual foundation (Lin et al. 2016).
4
Implications for Cultural Product Design
The extrinsic or manifest properties of the weaving box could serve as models for
cultural product designs. Superﬁcial function and appearance are important in product
design. They can make the consumer/viewer respond: “that really appeals to me” or
“that’s interesting”. But more is needed to gain real attraction to the consumer/viewer.
Those are the intrinsic properties of culture which speak directly to the interior feelings
or soul of the viewer. By incorporating these, the viewer may well say not just that the
product is attractive but that he really desires it (Lin et al. 2015). That is, he may respond
as a collector does in his desire to possess something because it touches his heart and
soul and consequently be willing to spend considerable money to possess it. A common
question asked of a collector who prizes a simple looking artiﬁce such as the gungu is:
What do you see in that old thing? “See” is a very short word standing for a very complex
emotional reaction from seeing as well as an experiencing an actual and virtual haptic
sensation of tactile feeling (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014).
The ﬁrst response is to the box’s extrinsic surface appearances: the sculptural qual‐
ities of size, form and shape; the color; the wonderful patina; the surface qualities of
smoothness as well as the pleasing irregularities of a lovingly handmade object. The eye
can partially detect these for the mind which can be additionally pleased by the virtual
haptic sensations the eye sets up. Looking at an object arouses virtual sensations of tactile
feel if attention is paid. The art connoisseur Bernard Berenson said that he experienced
“ideated sensations” in front of paintings which stimulated his tactile sense and changed
the tonus of his muscles. But the hand passed over the surface of the gungu is pleased
beyond what the eye can detect and induce. Here the regular and irregular textures, the
smooths and the roughs, the curves and the planes, the solidity and much more are
directly felt and enjoyed. “Don’t Touch” is a cruel prohibition to the haptic aesthetic
sensibilities (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014). It is the equivalent of posting “Don’t Look” beside
the Mona Lisa. And even the ear is pleased by the sound from thumping the box and
perhaps images come to mind knowing the history of its use as a drum. These are all
Cultural Ergonomics Beyond Culture
359

satisfactions arising from sensory impressions and to some extent might be judged to
be superﬁcial.
But secondly, at a deeper and emotional level, a sensitive observer may “see”, “feel”
or even “hear” as though he were actually there the sharp clack-clack of the beaters of
generations of women as they press against that box and perhaps sing as they loom cloth
to clothe their children and menfolk and their spiritual times when weaving the now
nearly lost powerful patterns of spiritual protection, ritual use, and cultural meaning
(Kring et al. 2006). Such a collector is in contact with people of long ago and far away
and there is both joy and sadness in that old weaving box. That is what one can “see” in
that old thing (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014).
To a sensitive observer, the weavings made on such looms of the aboriginal peoples
are also appealing as is nearly anything handmade in which the passion and “soul” of
the artist as well as the technique can be perceived. Unfortunately, all the old authentic
weavings seem to exist only in museums, collections and/or as fragments. In so many
native cultures around the world the knowledge and necessity for their arts and crafts
and spirituality have either vanished or are vanishing. Sadly, this is also true for Taiwan’s
aboriginals (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014). But for those who lament this fact, let them simply
pay the aboriginal artists the price for their art and it will ﬂourish as never before.
However, one must be discerning in what is purchased. If only the best is accepted,
only the best will be produced. The old axiom: “bad money drives out good money” is
equally true in that accepting inferior work drives out better work. It is amazing that the
aboriginal women carried information for weaving complicated patterns in their memo‐
ries and were able to execute it on their backstrap looms. Such knowledge needed to be
carefully passed down from mother to daughter by example and instruction. Once that
chain is broken, and without the means of recording the weaving instructions, a pattern
could be lost to posterity.
Taiwan however is very fortunate that through the painstaking and loving work over
many years by Professor Yu-Shan Tsai at Fu Jen Catholic University and of Mrs. Yuma
Taru in Miaoli County, many of the aboriginal patterns which would otherwise be lost
have now been preserved in modern weavers’ notation so that they can be woven again.
The world owes a great deal to such women.
The old authentic pieces were woven on a backstrap loom and made of hand spun
material such as ramie. Before commercial dyes with their bright and wide range of
colors became available, the threads were colored with native dyes. Although old
patterns may be copied, modern pieces are now often woven of commercial cotton
threads using commercial dyes and on a modern ﬂoor loom. Moreover, the “authentic”
pieces were woven within a deﬁnite spiritual and cultural ethic (Lee 2000; Lin and
Kreifeldt 2014).
Does a modern weaving suﬀer for these reasons against the authentic? To a collector;
yes - to some extent. Clothiers appraising a fabric speak of its “hand” meaning its “feel”
(Kreifeldt et al. 2011). The “feel” of a product can be as important as its “look” in terms
of satisfaction. (In some cases, such as a razor or toothbrush, “feel” is more important
than “look”.) The beauty of a pattern, identical in a modern and in an old weaving, may
be the same. However the “feel” to the ﬁngers of a modern weaving with its uniform,
smooth, commercial cotton threads diﬀers greatly from that of an old weaving with its
360

rougher threads of irregularly hand spun ramie. This diﬀerence is also apparent on close
visual inspection. And of course, the history of the two pieces is importantly diﬀerent.
Collectors of tribal art generally prefer the “authentic”. They even attribute to it that
important aspect of “honesty” of a work made for use within a particular ethnic culture.
In fact, some collectors will accept only objects showing signs of tribal wear as an
indication of its being “authentic” as long as the wear itself is “authentic”. Wear tells its
own stories about a tribal piece.

Framework for Hand Held Products
Because of their conservative natures “primitive” cultures have much to teach about
modern product design. Such cultures have generally slowly and cleverly improved their
tools. An example is the paddy cutting knife carved from a deer antler by an Iban man
of Borneo as shown in Fig. 3. Although serving only as knife to cut the ripe rice stalks
several features may be noted. Firstly, although a humble utilitarian tool it is beautifully
carved with ﬁgures. In fact its beauty attracted its collector. The carved ﬁgures are not
necessary for performing its physical function but have great spiritual symbolism to
these people. They are also suggestive of the human need for beauty as shown in Fig. 3
(Kreifeldt and Hill 1974; Liu 2007; Lin et al. 2016).

Secondly, its design form permits gathering and cutting the rice stalk easily and
naturally with one hand (one hand operation). Thirdly, and importantly for product
designers, the “product designer” had taken advantage of the pronged shape of the antler
so that the tool naturally conforms to the hand which has the eﬀect of the tool holding
the hand rather than the hand holding the tool. That frees up the ﬁngers of the hand to
perform the tool’s function rather than being devoted to holding the tool. An examination
of such simple tools or products of other cultures can readily suggest design principles
(Kreifeldt and Hill 1974; Lin et al. 2016).
The “preference for the primitive” exists in every culture and every age. The “old
ways” seem better than the “new ways”. There is the feeling that older and less “sophis‐
ticated” works are morally and aesthetically superior to modern ones. Even the ancient
Greeks looked to their past as being better. An Iban grandmother in Borneo complained
that her granddaughters having been to school are now quite useless because now they
“can’t cook, can’t mind babies, and can’t even make a mat” (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014).
This simple statement emphasis that “education” is a double edged sword or perhaps a
sword without a grasping handle: dangerous to both user and foe. Where and how did
this particular attractiveness of earlier products arise? They were generally made for a
particular person, or for one’s God or king. The desire was to please by all the perfection
and ingenuity of which the maker was capable believing that the recipient would take
no less (Kreifeldt and Hill 1974; Lin et al. 2016).
What may be gained in product design by the use of globally available technology
can also produce a profound lost as that characterless technology replaces the local
cultural underpinnings that create a unique character. This leads to products with an
“international” design lacking any particular, pleasingly, and identiﬁable cultural iden‐
tity. As a result they may be valued for the money paid for them but they are not treasured
or cherished because they do not “speak” to the owner. They are quickly discarded when
an “improved” version comes to market (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014).

Summary
Taiwan is a multi-culture blend of traditional Chinese with signiﬁcant East Asian inﬂu‐
ences including Japanese and such Western inﬂuences as American, Spanish and Dutch.
With their beautiful and primitive visual arts and crafts, Taiwan’s aboriginal cultures
should have great potential for enhancing design value and being recognized in the
global market (Lee 1982). Evidence shows that the prospect of Taiwan’s local cultures
will undoubtedly become crucial cultural elements in future design applications. Over
time, Taiwan gradually developed its own distinct culture, mostly from a variation of
Hoklo culture from Southern China (Lee 1997). Of course, the Taiwanese aboriginals
also have distinct cultures. For example, aboriginal music from the Bunun tribe played
at the 1996 Olympic Games brought that form of music to the global arena. Additionally,
martial art movies from Bruce Lee to Jacky Chan to the Oscar-winning movie director
Ang Lee have promoted recognition of Taiwanese culture at the international level (Wu
et al. 2004, 2005).

The increasing emphasis on localized cultural development in Taiwan demonstrates
an ambition to promote the Taiwanese style in the global economic market. Current
design philosophy and practice in Taiwan is directed to producing products with cultural
signiﬁcance to compete in the global market. Then a product may be produced which
the consumer not only values for the money paid for it but is also treasured and cherished
(Hsu et al. 2013).

Abstract. Ideality describes the arts striving toward perfection, beauty and
reﬁnement in all aspects of life. For reality, the product should also ﬁt into a
context of use and meet user requirements. Transforming “ideality” into “reality”
involves more than considering the product design itself. It remains a challenge
to represent use contexts and user needs in a way that designers with technical
backgrounds are able to make direct use of them. When designing “arts” into
“business”, we need a better understanding of human-art interaction not just for
taking part in the humanity context, but also for developing the interactive expe‐
rience of arts. Therefore, we propose a general framework for aesthetic design
that applies to representing human-art interactions and translating aesthetics into
user requirements in real product design cases. The intended purpose of this paper
is to provide a framework for examining the way designers interact across the art
and the interactive experiences of users in the design process.

Introduction
We now live in a small world with a large global market. While the market heads toward
“globalization”, design tends toward “localization.” So we must “think globally” for the
market, but “act locally” for design (Lin 2011). In the global market - local design era,
connections between arts and aesthetic design have become increasingly close. For local
design, culture and arts value-adding creates the core of local design value. It’s the same
for the global market; local design is the motivation for pushing culture and arts forward
in global market development (Lin and Chen 2012). Recently, creative industries are
constantly emerging in culture and arts and can become a key trend in aesthetic design
(Monk and Lelos 2007). While aesthetic design is under tough competitive pressure

from the developing global market, it seems that the local design should be focused on
“culture and arts” for designing “aesthetics” into modern products (Smyth and Wallace
2000).
Culture and arts play an important roles in the design ﬁeld, and will be a key design
factors in the local design. Thus, designing culture and arts into products will be a design
trend in the global market (Lin 2007). In today’s competitive market, “innovation”
serves as a competitive advantage allowing companies to dominate particular market
segments. With respect to corporate strategy, innovation is the key not only to extending
market share, but also to increasing commercial gains (Lin and Chen 2012). With the
development of industrial tendencies, most companies gradually realize that the keys to
product innovation are not only market and technology aspects but also aesthetic design
(Smyth and Wallace 2000). Recently, there is a shift from technological innovation to
aesthetics that is based on discovering new opportunities in the marketplace. Companies
are more focused on adapting new technologies and combining them in ways that create
new experiences and values for customers. Cultural product design has received
increased attention in the academic and business communities over the past decade. Both
academics and practitioners had emphasized that the role of service design in innovative
product development relates not only to aesthetics, but also to aspects such as ergo‐
nomics, user-friendliness, eﬃcient use of materials, functional performance, and so on
(Lin and Chang 2004).
The importance of studying aesthetic design is shown repeatedly in several studies
in all areas of design ﬁeld (Crilly et al. 2004). Despite the recognized importance of
aesthetic design in cultural and creative design industries, they lack a systematic
approach to it (Monk and Lelos 2007). Obviously, we need a better understanding of
human-arts communications not only for the global market, but also for local design.
While cross-cultural issues become important for product design in the global economy,
the intersection of design and culture becomes a key issue making both local design and
the global market worthy of further in-depth study (Lin and Lin 2010). Therefore, this
study focuses on the analysis of art works in which the aesthetic elements are used. Then,
a framework is proposed to provide designers with a valuable reference for designing a
successful cultural product (Smyth and Wallace 2000). Results presented herein create
an interface for examining the way designers communicate across art work as well as
the interwoven experience of incorporating design and aesthetics into the design process.

Framework for Designing Art into Reality
According to communication theory, an art work must reach three functions to express
its signiﬁcance through the communication system. (1) Signiﬁcation: the art work can
express a kind of signiﬁcance; that is, the artist’s intentions can indeed be expressed
through the art work. (2) Expression: the art work may represent the artist’s and feelings;
that is, through the art works, the artist’s imaginations thoughts and feelings can be
reproduced. (3) Communication: the art works of signiﬁcation and expression can be
sent to the audience only when the artist’s thoughts are identical to the audience (Fiske
2013; Norman 2004).

R. Lin et al.

Based on previous studies (Lin 2007, 2009, 2011; Lin and Chen 2012; Lin and Lin
2010; Lin et al. 2007, 2009), a research framework combining communication theory
with a design model was proposed to explore the issue of turing arts into reality as shown
in Fig. 1. Taking Mondrian’s art works as an example, the research framework consists
of three main phases: art paradigm, paradigm shift model, and cultural products. The art
paradigm concerns selecting appropriate art works for the paradigm shift. The paradigm
shift model focuses on how to extract artistic features from art works and then transfer
these art elements to design practice. The design practice is composed of three phase;
identiﬁcation, translation and implementation, to ﬁnally design a creative product.
Fig. 1. The research framework for turning arts into reality
In the identiﬁcation phase, art features are identiﬁed from an original art work
including the outer level of colors, texture, and pattern; the mid level of function,
usability, and safety, and the inner level of emotion, symbolic meaning, and stories. The
designer uses the scientiﬁc method and other methods of inquiry and hence is able to
obtain, evaluate, and utilize art information from the art work (Lin 2007). The translation
phase translates the art information to art features within a chosen art work. The designer
achieves some depth and experience of practice in these art features and at the same time
is able to relate the art elements to design problems in modern society. This produces
an appreciation for the interaction between arts, technology, and society (Lin 2007).
Finally, the implementation phase expresses the art elements associated with the artistic
features, the meaning of the chosen art work, an aesthetic sensibility, and the ﬂexibility
to adapt to various designs. At this time, the designer gains knowledge of an art work
and an understanding of the spectrum of symbolic meaning and value related to it. The
designer combines this symbolic meaning with his strong sense of art knowledge to deal

with design issues and to employ all of the art features in designing a cultural product
(Lin 2007).
For design practices of the paradgim shift model, three levels are identiﬁed as:
transfer, transit and transformation, which can be mapped into three levels of design
features: visceral design, behavioral design and reﬂective design (Norman 2004). The
key factor in the transfer level is duplication which concerns the appearance of an art
work and transfers its form, textures, and pattern into a new product. The visceral design
feature becomes important where appearance matters and ﬁrst impressions are formed.
The transit level which is behavioral design concerns how to transit the use, function,
performance and usability from an art work. Based on the decomposition, the behavioral
design feature is the key to a product’s usefulness. In the transformation level, reﬂective
design concerns feeling, emotion, and cognition of a cultural object. The reﬂective
design feature is the most vulnerable to variability through culture, experience, educa‐
tion, and individual diﬀerences. Innovaton is the eﬀectiveness factor, which is how to
touch the audience and to take the right actions; that is, how eﬀectively does the received
meaning aﬀect the audience.
For the framework, the designer focuses on the analysis of art elements in which the
art work was used. Cultural product results from the art features that have been redeﬁned
in order to design a cultural and aesthetical product. The user’s recognition is developed
through interaction with the cultural product. Based on the cultural context, the designer
expects the user’s recognition to be identical to the design model through the culture
aspect of interaction design. For the user’s recognition, the user communicates directly
with the cultural product. If the cultural product does not make the culture meaning clear
and attractive, then use will end with the wrong message during the human-product
interaction (Norman 1988). Thus, for the users, there are also three levels of human-
product interaction: aesthetic experience, experience of meaning, and emotional expe‐
rience. The aesthetic experience which is transfer level, involves a cultural product’s
form, color, texture, etc., to delight the user’s sensory modalities (Crilly et al. 2004).
The experience of meaning which is transit level, involves the user’s ability including
operation, safety, etc., to assign the design features and assess user pleasure with the
cultural product (Desmet and Hekkert 2007). The emotional experience which is trans‐
formation level, involves user emotion including self-image, personal satisfaction,
memories, etc., which are elicited by the art works and designed into the cultural product
(Bermond 2008).

A Case Study of Turning “Mondrian” into “Interior”
The Piet Mondrian (1872–1944) was an important contributor to the De Stijl art move‐
ment and group (Warncke 1991). He created a characteristic and immediately recog‐
nizable style of painting and evolved a non-representational form which he termed Neo-
plasticism. His most famous compositions consisted of arrangements of colored ﬁelds
and black lines over a white background, upon which was painted a grid of vertical and
horizontal black lines and the three primary colors (Locher et al. 2005; Taft 1997). Some
of the earliest experiments in computer graphics-based art mimicked some of
368
R. Lin et al.

Mondrian’s compositions, because its surface features are easily reproduced with
computer algorithms (Noll 1995, 1966). Based on the research framework as shown in
Fig. 1, the features of Mondrian’s compositions would appear to be a good basis for
reality visualization. The use of recognizable style and three distinguishable colors
together with geometrical form seemed a good paradigm for turning “Mondrian” into
“Interior” (Mondrian 1995, 2008).
Developing an aesthetic product involves more than considering the “culture” or “art
work.” Based on the art work, the aesthetic product should also ﬁt into a context of “art
work” or cultural meaning in use and meet user requirements (Dan 2013; Kujala et al.
2001). It remains a challenge to represent use contexts and user needs in a way that
designers with art work backgrounds are able to make direct use of them. Using the
framework as an approach, this paper explored Mondrian’s art work, translating it into
user needs and user requirements in aesthetic product design cases.
3.1
Turning “Mondrian” into “Interior” from the Outer Level
The design features derived from the outer level, which is visceral design concerning
physical and material elements, focuses on Mondrian’s composition that if color repre‐
sents meaning and expression it has to be a universal, general meaning formulated in
every separated color and speciﬁed in the relation unity of image which is associated
with material, colors, texture, and pattern. Mondrian expressed that Unity and relation‐
ship are the determinants in the roots of the meaning in colors (Dan 2013; Locher et al.
2005; Taft 1997).
The identiﬁcation phase attempts to determine user needs. Considering the situation
in Taiwan’s apartments, there are many utility meters, such as water, electricity, gas as
shown in on left of Fig. 2, which make disorder and a mess along a long narrow passage.
Furthermore, the hydrant that supplies water to extinguish ﬁres is very important for
safety. The hydrant must be visible during a ﬁre as shown in the left of Fig. 3, but may
be invisible otherwise.

369

Fig. 3. Storage for hydrant
In the translation phase: the analysis of the color and form could provide the designer
with an idea of how to transfer the Mondrian’s work into interior design. There consid‐
erable graphic documentation about Mondrian’s Post-Impressionist period, especially
in form and color. For example, his painting Avond (1908) shows a color palette
consisting almost fully red, yellow and blue colors (Barriga 2011). It was the ﬁrst
Mondrian’s work that emphasized only the use of primary colors. In this way, Mondrian
eliminated all what was formal in pictorial image. He expressed that modern painting
did not have to be ﬁgurative and it did not have to be implicated in representation of
apparently real objects; but that painting had to be a searching of what is absolute, and
that is found hidden behind real forms. In summary, his aesthetic thought was based on
the searching of a pure art. Furthermore, Mondrian’s art work emphasizes the meaning
of harmony and order in reality.
In the implementation Phase: From a usability point of view, the designer used
Mondrian’s color and form for rearranging the utility storage as shown in the Fig. 2.
Figure 3 shows the idea that derives from Mondrian’s art work to show he meaning of
harmony and order in the hydrant storage.
3.2
Turning “Mondrian” into “Interior” from the Mid-Level
The mid-level which is behavioral design focuses on the behavioral level including
function, usability, and the scenarios in which people would use the “Mondrian” on
diﬀerent occasions. For example, Holmquist and Skog (2003) found the Mondrian’s
compositions to be a good basis for abstract information visualization. The use of three
easily distinguishable colors together with geometrical shapes seemed ideal to visualize
dynamic data concerning e-mail traﬃc, current weather, weather forecasts, and most
recently bus departure times. These are typical examples of turning “Mondrian” into
“visualization” in that data has been mapped to the size, position, and color of the ﬁelds
in a composition. From the usability point of view, the “Mondrian” is a special interface
used in the ambient information visualization (Holmquist and Skog 2003). Therefore,
the design features on the middle level of the “Mondrian” should be focused on how to
express its function based on ergonomics.

R. Lin et al.

In the identiﬁcation phase: What are the user needs? We need storage room in our
living space, such as TV case, book shelf, cabinet, closet etc.; In addition, the user needs
a projection screen and a whiteboard for teaching and writing. Therefore, the method of
turning “Mondrian” into “Interior” from “ideality” to “reality” becomes an important
issue at mid -level.
In the translation phase: taking Mondrian’s compositions series 1917–1940 as an
example, the composition series also called “Neo-plasticism” (Troy 1979) which want
to emphasize the art meaning that artists want to express, but tries to balance the rela‐
tionship between the form and the art meaning (Fendelman and Taylor 1999). In that
time, it is necessary to emphasize the appearance because the appearance that will tell
audience whether a work actually expresses a pure plasticism of the universal. Execution
in ideality is to art what action in reality is to life. It is noted that people from diﬀerent
cultures use diﬀerent ways to understand Mondrian’s composition representing diﬀerent
cultural meanings. Within these cultures, they may share some diﬀerences and similar‐
ities in turning “ideality of Mondrian” into “reality of interior” either the form or the art
meaning. “Ideality” and “reality” between the form and the art meaning are the crucial
elements for the core value of the Mondrian’s composition.
In the implementation phase: for the mid-level in Neo-plasticism appearance, the
most external means for the expression of form and natural color are internalized and
thus rendered equivalent to the pure plastic means of essence. The essence of Neo-
plasticism is more important than external appearance. For example, Mondrian’s
“Composition 2” (1922) (Locher et al. 2005) is composed of rectangular form with
colors as shown in Fig. 4. These rectangular color planes express harmony which is the
nature of Neo-plasticism. Based on “Composition 2,” Fig. 5 shows how to turn “Compo‐
sition 2” into “reality” as a projection screen or a whiteboard for writing. Consequently,
Fig. 5 shows how to combine Mondrian’s art works – Tableau No. IV: Lozenge Compo‐
sition with Red, Gray, Blue, Yellow, and Black (1924/1925), with “Composition With
gray and Light brown 1” to design a TV case and book shelf together (McManus et al.
1993).

3.3
Turning “Mondrian” into “Interior” from the Inner-Level
The inner-level which is reﬂective design contains special content such as stories,
emotion, and cultural features, and focuses on the symbolic meaning of the Mondrian.
In general, the Inner-level interface of the Mondrian is derived from the symbolic
meaning of color. The reﬂective design focuses on the Mondrian’s work that is closely
linked to a spiritual and philosophical interest. His art was linked to the theosophical
movement (Blavatsky 2012) which studied reality on the basis of mysticism.
The identiﬁcation phase asks: What are the user needs? The author traveled all over
the world and collected many souvenirs and other collections representing their memo‐
ries in diﬀerent countries. So, the user needs a space for keep these materials not only
for display but also for memory. Mondrian was interested in esthetic and theoretical
thinking that creating happiness and harmony in the inner and the outer of his works.
He found a theoretical support for the development of his plastic activity, and knew a
diﬀerent kind of beauty: one that he creates himself, and that in nature appears only
under a veil (Barriga 2011; Dan 2013).
In the translation phase, Mondrian expressed that if color represents meaning and
expression, it has to be a universal meaning and formulated in every separated color and
speciﬁed in the relational unity of image (Fendelman and Taylor 1999). For instance,
unity and relationship are the determinants in the roots of the meaning in color. Mondrian
oﬀered no opinion on the question of whether color carries an inner meaning of its own.
He needed to make the universal visible which forced him to keep available the possi‐
bilities of the pure and saturated color. Then, Mondrian used the concept in all of his
works. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the esthetic-semiotic thinking
currents started to be interested in language pictorial representation, by means of
symbols and signs, both in abstract and ﬁgurative painting, design and architecture.
Although arts are based on communicative elements, they cannot be studied exclusively
through aesthetic or semiotic cases (Barriga 2011). Though Mondrian was not interested
in symbology of form, his philosophical studies were based on geometric abstraction
looking for the basic structure of universe. The main concept that tries to represent
simplicity and harmony with the white background crossed by a lines grid of black color
and the blocks of primary colors were considered by Mondrian as the basic colors of the
372

universe (Taft 1997). For examples, Mondrian’s art works Composition London (1940),
Composition 8 (1939), Composition with black yellow and red (1939), and Composition
in Blue (1937) are shown in Fig. 6 (Locher et al. 2005; McManus et al. 1993).

In implementation phase, based on the previous composition, the original idea
showed at the left of Fig. 6. Although the idea expressed the structure of Mondrian’s
composition, it was too complicated to express the inner meaning of Mondrian’s compo‐
sition. After modifying, the ﬁnal “Memory” closet is shown at the right of Fig. 6.

Designing “Arts” into “Product Design”
Designing “Arts” into “Product Design” will be a design trend in the global market. This
is not a new idea; for example, Rietveld founded his own furniture factory in 1918. He
involved the current scientiﬁc theory, mechanical production, modern city rhythms and
Stijl moment’s theories, in a conceptual development of form. In 1918, he designed the
red and blue chair, considered as a true art work by generations of designers, and a
product design paradigm. (Billinghurst et al. 2001; Van Zijl 1999). On the other hand,
E-business is considered to be one of the pivotal components in cultural and creative
design industries which have a signiﬁcant impact on consumer perception of innovation.
Lin (2009) proposed an ABCDE business model for turning “Aesthetics” into “Busi‐
ness”: we need “Creativity” and “Design,” then put the results of ABCD in E-business.
It is a new approach that integrates design, culture, artistic craftsmanship, creativities
and service innovation design in cultural and creative design industries.
For the local design, Qualia has gained popularity and broad application in product
design. “Qualia” is a Latin adjective that refers to quality and comprises ﬁve elements:
attractiveness, beauty, creativity, delicacy, and engineering. The sense of diﬀerence lies
in quality, which includes attractiveness, beauty, and creativity, in which content renders
the product surface (Yen et al. 2013). Attractiveness, beauty, and creativity belong to
the emotional condition of the product “psychology”; delicacy and engineering belong
to the rational condition of the product “physiology.” Thus, qualia products involve
rational conditions for consumer use but do not neglect emotional appeal (Mandler
2005; Bermond 2008). Taking Mondrian’s art works as an example, the author turned

them into “real products.” including Dining Table, Coﬀee Table, and Corner Table as
shown in Fig. 7 from left to right.

Summary
Understanding how to turn “Arts” into “Business” for “Creativity” and “Design”, and
E-business for creative industries are important research issues. Those issues are not so
well covered until now. Therefore, based on the e-business, this paper proposes a
research framework for illustrating how to transform “art” into “e-business”, and design
these aesthetic features into modern products to reinforce their business value. The
framework of human-arts interaction provides a diﬀerent way of thinking about inter‐
active experiences with aesthetics. The most important part of this process is the user
experience added into the cultural product design process and involved aesthetic design
considerations. The framework is of value for designers because it can help to design
“art elements” into aesthetic design, as well as provide users with a valuable reference
for understanding aesthetic meaning. Results presented herein create an interface for
looking at the way arts crosses over into product design, as well as illustrating the inter‐
woven experience of arts and creativity in the innovation design process.
Along with Information Technology progress, e-business is becoming the most
common concept in the Internet and electronic commerce world. However, in today’s
intensely competitive business climate, innovative products become central in e-busi‐
ness development. To be successful, innovative products must have a clear and signif‐
icant diﬀerence that is responding to a marketplace needs. Furthermore, changes in
consumer perception regarding aesthetics are also important in product design. For
future studies, we need a better understanding of the acculturation process not only for
the aesthetic in local design, but also for the user needs in the global market. While
aesthetic features become important issues in the interactive experiences of users, the
acculturation process between human and arts becomes a key issue in the cultural
product design and are worthy of further in-depth study.

Abstract. The purpose of this study is to explore the meaning of cultural
objects and to extract their cultural features from Taiwanese aboriginal culture.
Atayal is a tribe of Taiwanese aborigines whose culture is disappearing rapidly
due to a hundred years of colonization. The weaving box, a cultural object,
unique to the Atayal loom, is the subject of this study. Based on the previous
studies, this study proposes a cultural ergonomic research model to provide
designers with a valuable reference for designing a successful cross-cultural
product as well as the interwoven experience of design and culture in the design
process. This study attempts to illustrate how by enhancing the original meaning
and images of Taiwan aboriginal culture features they may be transformed into
modern products by taking advantage of new production technology and so
fulﬁll the needs of the contemporary consumer market.

Introduction
Cultural ergonomics extends our understanding of cultural meaning and our ability to
utilize such understanding for design and evaluating everyday products (Kaplan 2004).
Designers need to develop a better understanding of cultural ergonomics not just to
participate in cultural contexts but also to develop interactive experiences for users.
Thus, cultural ergonomics is an approach that considers interaction and experience-
based variations among cultures in cultural product design (Lin et al. 2016). Hence,
cultural products can extend the heritage and traditional values of different cultures to
the consumer and increase the sense of spiritual essence in human life (Varutti 2015;
Guttentag 2009). Perhaps the best way to extend a unique culture, as for example when
we talk about the impressions of different culture garments, crafts, decorations, utensils,
furniture, ornaments, packages, etc., is to promote it to users’ daily lives through
product usage (Lin 2007, 2009). Culture plays an important role in the design ﬁeld,

and cross-cultural design will be a key design evaluation point in the future. Designing
“culture” into products will be a design trend in the global market. Obviously, we need
a better understanding of cross-cultural communications not only for the global market,
but also for local design. While cross-cultural issues become important for product
design in the global economy, the intersection of design and culture becomes a key
issue making both local design and the global market worthy of further in-depth study
(Lin et al. 2009). The importance of studying culture is shown repeatedly in several
studies in all areas of technology design.
Taiwan is a multi-culture fusion of traditional Chinese with signiﬁcant East Asian
inﬂuences. Over time, Taiwan gradually developed its own distinct culture, mostly
from a variation of Southern China culture (Lin 2007). Evidence shows that the pro-
spect of Taiwan’s local cultures will undoubtedly become crucial cultural elements in
future design applications (Lin 2009). Of course, the Taiwanese aboriginals also have
distinct and abundant cultures. With their beautiful, primitive, and spiritually motived
visual arts and crafts, Taiwan’s aboriginal cultures should have great potential for
enhancing design value, and being recognized in the global market (Hsu et al. 2013).
For example, the Atayal tribe which is composed of several subgroups is one of the
best weaving tribes in Taiwan. In their traditional society, Atayal men did the hunting,
ﬁghting, farming and house building, while Atayal women were known for the artistry
of their handwoven artifacts (Chang et al. 2008). Having suffered from their traditions
being nearly extinguished in the past colonial periods, the Atayal tribe members are
now trying to retrieve their textile traditions and they have already achieved fruitful
innovations rooted in their ancestors’ wisdom (Yoshimura and Wall 2014). For
example, the ﬁrst author has spent years “reverse engineering” many old woven tribal
patterns to preserve the knowledge of how to weave them, a knowledge that was
formerly passed from mother to daughter. She also runs and is trying to improve a
school for the children of a poor village in the hills above Miaoli, has built a cultural
center called lihang workshop and promotes interest in their culture (https://www.
facebook.com/lihangworkshop).
The weaving art of the Atayal in Taiwan has developed rapidly over the past
decade. Women’s weavings have performed outstandingly in various textiles exhibi-
tions through combining traditional textiles with modern weaving techniques. For
example, Yuli Taki is also trying to preserve cultural patterns by commercializing use
of them (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014). The Truku used to be one of the several sub-
groupings of the Atayal peoples but are now ofﬁcially recognized as an independent
group. (The aboriginal groups seem to be fractioning at a great rate.) However, while
Truku weaving has much in common with other Atayal peoples, Truku textiles are
distinguished by their light weight, thinness, quiet color and patterns mostly of single
lozenges (https://www.facebook.com/yuli.taki/). Among some Atayal peoples such as
the Malikuowan, these seemingly simple lozenge shapes are called “eyes” and stand for
the blessings of countless ancestors. With those blessings the people could enter the
land of happiness and join their ancestors forever.
Such spirituality characterizes much tribal design giving it an immediacy which
even outsiders can feel deeply and respond to without knowing much, if anything,
about the culture of the peoples who produced it. Such feeling can transcend cultural
378

differences. An outsider may say that certain primitive art “speaks” to him which is
more than just an expression.
By using a cultural ergonomic approach, the gungu, literally “weaving box” in the
Atayal aboriginal language, was chosen as the cultural object for discussion in this
study. A framework will be proposed for examining the way designers communicate
across cultures as well as the interwoven experience of ergonomic design and culture
meaning in the design process. Using the framework, this study attempts to illustrate
how, by enhancing the original meaning and images of Taiwan aboriginal culture
features, and taking advantage of new production technology, they may be transformed
into modern products and so fulﬁll the needs of the contemporary consumer market
(Lin 2007, 2009).

Cultural Object of Atayal Loom
Although the date of the ﬁrst loom or even what it looked like is unknown. As a
weaving tool in one form or another it dates back at least to the ancient Egyptians and
Greeks (Roth 1913, 1918). Three main types of loom were used in the ancient world:
the horizontal ground loom, the vertical loom with upper and lower beams around
which the warp threads are wound, and the vertical loom with warp weights. The warp
is the stationary threads across which the weft threads are woven in and out. The
horizontal ground loom is the older of the looms of Ancient Egypt (Crowfoot 1937;
Faxon 1932).
The Atayal woven crafts played a large role in the tribe’s social customs and
organization. These crafts were woven on a type of loom called a “backstrap” loom
which is the subject of this study. “Backstrap” refers to the strap behind the weaver’s
back as in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The Atayal loom is one of the original types of simple
movable backstrap-type looms (Broudy 1979). The earliest example (201 B.C.–8 A.D.)
of a backstrap loom in eastern Asia is found at a site in Shizhaishan, Yunnan Province
(Broudy 1979). It was similar in principle to the Atayal loom in being “foot braced”.
That is, the weaver controlled the tension of the warp threads by pushing with her feet
against a brace. The foot brace could be a simple bar but in the Atayal loom it is the
culturally important “box” By changing the arrangement of the warping bench and
one’s way of weaving, simple even weaves to Atayal’s own characteristic complex
patterns can be woven.
Traditional Atayal looms were composed of many parts, with one of the most
important being the Weaving Box, made of tough woods like beech and Formosan
michelia. The weaving box was not only an important part, but could also be used for
storage when weaving wasn’t taking place (Broudy 1979). In the days long ago when
head hunting was practiced, the hollow box could be struck to make a loud drum sound
as a signal to the village that a warrior had returned with a head. For a clear under-
standing of the Atayal loom, the features of all parts of the Atayal loom must be
understood. Diagrams of their parts are therefore included in Fig. 1 and Table 1.
The threads in Fig. 1 are called the “warp”. Weaving consists of lacing a “weft”
thread over and under selected warp threads as it goes from one side of the warp to the
other and then reverses direction and repeats lacing and so on until ﬁnished. The “art”
Thoughts on Studying Cultural Ergonomics for the Atayal Loom
379

consists of choosing the colors for the warp threads and the complexity of the lacing of
the weft thread (which also may change colors) as it goes over some warp threads and
under others. It is the particular lacing plan in combination with the coloring of the
warp threads which makes the pattern. Practically inﬁnite combinations of colors and
lacings (i.e., patterns) exist. Creativity comes in designing aesthetically pleasing
combinations. In tribal days before writing and modern means of recording such
information existed, these highly complex combinations had to be committed to
memory and passed as instructions from mother to daughter - prodigious feats of
memory. Sadly, once that mother to daughter chain was broken, as by outside dis-
ruptions, this information was lost. It takes modern “reverse engineering”, special
coded weaving annotation, and great dedication, to reconstruct these instructions from
careful examination of existing examples and record them permanently for posterity.
Lest it be thought that weaving is somehow inferior to the other arts because it can be
described in this mechanical sounding fashion, it is also true that making piano or
organ music can be described (as Bach did) as just pressing the right keys down at the
right time and the music makes itself.
The weaves used by the Atayal and patterns produced with them are technically
interesting and aesthetically pleasing (Lin and Kreifeldt 2014). In the past, each tribe
could be distinguished by the unique types and patterns of its weavings. Recently, with
the rapidly changing social trends and progress in technology, tribes or individual
studios weaving textiles hope to see this ﬁeld embracing both tradition and originality
in order to create different possibilities for future development (Yoshimura and Wall
2014). Furthermore, the new Atayal weavers work closely with tourism marketing
channels to balance the production and marketing of textiles. Therefore, the future of
weaving art is full of hope and potential. The Atayal loom is apparently unique and
deserves in-depth study (Nettleship 1970).

Table 1. All parts of the Atayal Backstrap loom
Warp Case
There are “large” and “small” sizes for 
warp cases, which could have the length of 
90cm or 60cm, depending on the need of a 
weaver or the custom of a tribe. Usually it is 
sized to meet special physical needs of the 
weaver. The wooden materials usually are 
selected from trees that possess properties of 
sturdiness and firmness such as camphor tree, 
beech tree, Formosan Michelia tree and so on.
Fix Rod
The Fix Rod is made of straighter and 
longer Yushania bamboo internode. The 
diameter of a fix rod should be 0.6cm to 
1.3cm and the required length of a rod is 
usually based on the width of the demanded 
fabric, thus several different fix rods with 
different sizes should be prepared in advance.
Type 1 Warp Thread Divider
Type 2 Warp Thread Divider
The length of a warp thread divider is 
determined by the width of the piece of 
weaving fabric, which could be 50cm or 
35cm wide. Wood or Yushania bamboo is the 
selected material for making it. There are 2 
different types of warp thread dividers. The 
first type is widely used in most of the Atayal 
people’s areas, whilst the second type of warp 
thread divider is especially used in the 
catchment area of Ta’an river and also it’s 
used especially for pick-up pattern weaving 
techniques.
Type 1 Heddle Rod
Type 2 Heddle Rod
The length of a heddle bar is around 35cm 
long, determined by different fabric widths. 
Wood or Yushania bamboo material is 
selected for making heddle rods. There’re two 
types of them. The first type is made of thin 
and long Yushania bamboo and will get 
wound around with warp-tying yardage. The 
second type is a hairpin-shaped rod, which is 
made of twig wood and is widely used in the 
catchment area of Ta’an River. Both prongs 
of the hairpin-shaped rod are drilled with 
small eyes for fine threads to string through 
and get ready for sealing this part after warp 
threads are fixed into the oblong slot. The 
sealing can secures the warp threads from 
sliding off while weaving.

A Framework for Studying Cultural Ergonomics
Piegorsch (2009) described how an ergonomic bench was designed for indigenous
weavers in Guatemala that is a typical example of cultural ergonomics. The ergonomic
bench helps weavers enhanced their productivity and improved textile quality, while
also preventing cumulative trauma to their health. The bench focused on user-centered
ergonomic design and also stimulated self-awareness in traditional weaving. The
beneﬁts of cultural ergonomics can be represented as a cycle with ﬁve stages: health,
productivity, quality, culture and self-esteem (Piegorsch 2009). It is likely to be a
never-ending process and can be applied universally, strengthening the connection
between the designers and their cultural heritage as shown as the outer circular factors
in Fig. 2.
Pick Rod
Pick rods are made of Makino bamboo or 
wood materials, and usually will be prepared 
in many different sizes for making fabrics of 
different widths.
Wooden Beater
A wooden beater is made of sturdy 
hardwood material. The blade should be 
thicker at the upper part and get thinned 
towards the lower edge. It is typically 60cm 
in length and 5-6cm in width.
Shuttle
A Shuttle is a tool designed to neatly and 
compactly store the weft thread and carry it 
across the warp yarn while weaving. Shuttles 
are thrown or passed back and forth through 
the shed – an opening made between the 
threads of the warp - in order to weave in the 
weft.
A Pair of Cloth Beams
Cloth beams are made of sturdy wood 
material from the elm tree, camphor tree or 
Formosan Michelia tree. A tongue and a 
matching groove are cut into a pair of the 
cloth beams respectively for fastening the 
finished fabric tightly between them. The 
length of each beam is about 50 to 60cm. 
Back Strap
The Back Strap is woven out of rottan 
material or made of ramie through the bow 
weaving technique. The usual length is 50cm 
and width is about 50cm. Extra binding 
strings can be made based on a weaver’s 
need.

Y. Taru et al.

For the human system design, Kreifeldt and Hill (1974) proposed a user-tool-task
system design model that integrates ergonomics into product design for producing
aesthetically pleasing and functionally superior products. Base on the user-tool-task
model, Lin et al. (2016) proposed a framework for combining cultural features with
ergonomic design which facilitating an understanding of cultural ergonomics in pro-
duct design shown as the inner triangular factors in Fig. 2.
For the cultural ergonomics approach (Kring et al. 2006), the framework consists of
two main parts that function to explore the cultural ergonomics issues of the cultural
object and to study problems related to human factors. To accomplish the outer circular
factors: health, productivity, quality, culture and self-esteem, the inner triangular fac-
tors must be considered in practical ergonomic design (Piegorsch 2009). Thus, Fig. 2
details the various inﬂuences and interactions in a user-tool system and emphasizes the
threefold nature of the design: user, tool (product), and task. Among the user-tool-task,
there are the two interfaces of the user-tool manipulation interface (ergonomics) and the
tool-task engagement interface (technology); and the various interactions between user
needs and design requirements in the practical design process (marketing).
The user-tool-task model is designed to solve the problem of completing a task with
a tool; it focuses ﬁrst on the manipulation interface between the user and the tool and
then on the engagement interface between the tool and the task. Finally, for the global
market, adding a cultural dimension to ergonomics has become an important issue for
exploring interaction and experience in product design (Lin et al. 2016). Along with
technological progress, while product design has been transferred from being
manufacturing-based to marketing driven to user centered for some time, there is now
greater emphasis speciﬁcally on user experience, with ergonomics being increasingly
considered in interactional design for marketing.

Thoughts on Studying the Weaving Box
The weaving box, a cultural object and part of the Atayal loom, is the subject of this
study. Based on the cultural ergonomic approach in Fig. 2, the weaving box could be
employed for a systematized and scientiﬁc method to study the three aspects of cultural
ergonomics. First, ergonomic study of the weaving box across user operational situa-
tions needs to be analyzed to study the manipulation interface (ergonomics) between
users and the weaving box. Then, based on that analysis, the engagement interface
(technology) is studied to identify the relationship between the weaving box and the
task. Finally, based on the cultural-feature transformation model, the weaving box is
identiﬁed with three levels of cultural ergonomics and used to demonstrate how to
design cultural products (marketing) (Lin and Kreifeldt 2001).
Considered from the perspective of ergonomics, to develop an ideal loom in the
form of the weaving box, the social and operational interfaces of the weaving box both
need to be well designed using a user-tool-task approach. Especially, many studies
were made to evaluate the prevalence of low back pain among the handloom weavers
(Chaman et al. 2015; Durlov et al. 2014; Montamedzade et al. 2014). These studies
suggested the need for further research regarding the postural strain of weavers and also
emphasized the implementation of ergonomic design into the weaver’s loom. For a
good example, the ergonomic bench in Piegorsch’s research (2009) provides a cul-
turally, environmentally, and economically viable alternative to traditional methods of
working with the backstrap loom.
Considered from the perspective of technology, many tools were needed in tradi-
tional Atayal weaving as shown in Table 1. Women produced beautiful cloth relying
on their professional and aboriginal weaving skills (Wu 1998) but their tools are
inconvenient for fetching due to their overweight and numbers, and the tradition of
weaving while sitting on the ground. In recent years Atayal people has been seeking
creative and alternative ways. A new type of loom called a desktop inkle loom has been
devised. Inkle weaving is a type of warp-faced weaving where the shed is created by
manually raising or lowering the warp yarns (Patrick 2010), some of which are held in
place by ﬁxed heddles on a loom known as an inkle loom (https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Inkle_weaving).
Considered from the perspective of marketing, aboriginal cultural products that
tourists purchase as souvenirs are often actually imitations of the original products, and
sold without authorization from the aboriginal group (Guttentag 2009). Atayal textiles
are now handwoven by some aboriginal women in Wulai who weave primarily for the
Wulai Atayal Museum. Weaving exhibitions are the main purpose of the Wulai Atayal
museum since it opened in 2005. Other than displaying materials, techniques and ﬁnal
works, the museum arranges to have weavers do live demonstrations on weekends to
attract tourism. The museum also sells the works by the members in the weaving
association and invites them to be the seed teachers to design promotional activities
such as do-it-yourself for user experience, and promote traditional weaving through the
ﬂourishing tourism (Varutti 2015). Meanwhile, the reintroduction of weaving not only
required the Atayal weavers to retrace their weaving history and to reconstruct and

revive lost skills but also opened up a new opportunity to create new motifs with the
Atayal loom (Chang et al. 2008; Yoshimura and Wall 2014).

Summary
Based on a previous discussion (Lin et al. 2016), this study proposes a cultural
ergonomic research model to provide designers with a valuable reference for designing
a successful cross-cultural product as shown in Fig. 3. The model consists of four main
parts: conceptual model, research method, human system design, and cultural ergo-
nomic approach. The conceptual model focuses on how to extract cultural features
from cultural ergonomics and then transfer those features to the design transformation
model to design cultural products.
The research method consists of four steps: from cultural object to design infor-
mation, then to design elements, ﬁnally to creative products; and three stages: (1) ex-
tracting cultural features from original cultural objects (identiﬁcation), (2) translating
these features into design information and design elements (translation), and (3) de-
signing a cultural product (implementation).
The purpose of human system design research focuses on and analyzes the weaving
box’s appearance, usability, cultural meaning, operational interface, and the scenario in
which it is used. There are social meanings, ergonomic concerns and the functional
achievement associated with this cultural object. To develop an ideal loom, both the

cultural and operational interfaces of the “weaning box” need to be well-studied using a
user-tool-task approach (Lin and Kreifeldt 2001).
Recently, the reintroduction of weaving has had multiple effects on the Atayal
community. Now the Atayal proudly claim their weaving culture as a part of their
ethnic identity. The meaning of weaving has changed from the representation of the
Atayal women’s gender identity alone to the representation of the Atayal’s collective
ethnic identity as a whole (Yoshimura 2007). It has become an ethnic symbol and a
tourism product. However, the Atayal tribe, especially the residents of Wulai, are now
barely involved directly with tourism business although symbols of their identity are
used to promote tourism (Yoshimura 2007; Yoshimura and Wall 2014). As an example
of reviving tribal arts, a “carved, blackware pottery jar” recently made by Tammy
Garcia of the Santa Clara pueblo tribal people in the US state of New Mexico sold at
auction for $47,500. It expressed feelings of modernity but in the tradition of her
people (Johnson et al. 2015).
Having this in mind, we need to consider the following questions before using the
research model to explore the weaving box of Atayal loom.
1. For the user and ergonomics: Do we want simply to keep the craft alive? Or provide
work for the weavers? Or make an art of it? Or produce a high priced artist?
Deciding what will be a successful product has long been a problem. For every 100
“great” ideas, maybe one is commercially successful.
2. For the tool and technology: Crafts such as loom weaving are unique. Is “design”
really compatible with cultural tradition which tends to be conservative if it is to
retain its uniqueness? Hand work will always be a limited production technique. So
its value must be in aesthetics.
3. For the task and marketing (works): Maybe make individual design works which
would be prohibitive for machine making. Or create an artist weaving maker
demand. Also incorporate cultural motifs and designs. Or create an association
which will verify and can enforce a particular product as being of that culture. When
there is not enough authentic art to meet the demand and for the price, imitations
will be made for the market. The United States has a similar problem of the cultural
arts of the American Indians being imitated, misrepresented as authentic and sold.
Therefore the US Federal Government has enacted the Indian Arts and Crafts Act.
Under this act: “Native American art and craftwork must be marketed truthfully
regarding the Native American heritage and Tribal afﬁliation of the producer.”
(www.iacb.doi.gov).
There are many parallels to these questions and problems everywhere that native
cultures are disappearing and their arts and crafts along with them. It is strange that as
these cultures diminish or vanish altogether, their old traditional art pieces become
more and more sought by museums and private collectors and consequently become
more and more valuable. Beauty is the soul of the artist expressed in her art. Being
based in strong religious beliefs, tribal arts express that soul very strongly. It is a
mystery how tribal arts can speak to someone even across cultural oceans if not for
soul-to-soul communication. As others begin to see the beauty of the art and are moved
by it, they wish to possess it even without understanding or even knowing the culture
behind the art. That is the passion of the collector. Such cross cultural attraction with
386
Y. Taru et al.

consequent desire for possession is what designers of products for the international
market should hope to have their products evoke.
Continuing studies of what makes tribal arts such as the weavings of the Atayal, or
even a “tool” like the weaving box, so attractive cross culturally can deﬁnitely aid in
designing successful cross cultural products.

Abstract. This paper deals with the case studies and criteria applied to them in
terms of Chinese culturally orientated design, in order to test the author’s hypoth‐
eses about cultural reﬂections. It develops a three-layer design model reﬂects
Chinese cultural elements into design in terms of symbolic, behavioural and
political/philosophical, through methods and analysis of values in practice. Addi‐
tionally, for the readers sympathetic with a systematic design approach or cultural
identitarianism, this work addresses a view of critical understanding for facing
Chinese culture in design.
Keywords: Chineseness · Cultural transfer design · Symbolic transfer ·
Behavioural transfer · Philosophical transfer

Introduction
This paper comprises four sections. Section one deals with the relevant concepts around
culture, through short criteria of relevant concepts such as technology, globalisation,
and some of the general deﬁnitions of culture. This section aims to generate a charac‐
terization of culture, subsequently searching what Chineseness is. The second section
introduces the core hypothesis in this paper - ‘Chineseness’ - by comparing it to the form
“Chinoiserie”. The third section depicts three aspects in terms of Chinese cultural trans‐
ferring design: symbolic, behavioural, and philosophical/political. Then, in Sect. 4, it
forms a three-layer cultural transfer design model, which explores a systematic approach
to reﬂecting Chineseness from various cultural angles. These four sections in paper
include sources that evidence particular points of view about Chinese culture and design.
Additionally they throw up some speciﬁc challenges:
How can we characterise local culture that feeds into its social context and design
needs?
How can we manifest the cultural elements in design through design methods?

A Criteria of the Relevant Concepts Around ‘Culture’
What is culture? There are thousands of deﬁnitions of culture. Matthew Arnold deﬁned
culture as ‘a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters

which most concern us’, ‘the best which has been thought and said in the world’, and
through this knowledge, ‘turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stock
notions and habits, which we now follow staunchly but mechanically’ [1]. Whereas the
view of aspiration towards cultural perfection may not resonate completely today, the
sense of culture being very broadly interpreted is one the author can identify with as a
designer’s ‘fresh and free thought’, applicable to individual contexts. In another words,
culture is an empty vase, a vehicle, which takes the input and output of individuals and
groups of people within their surrounding environment and context. Thus, through the
criteria of the concepts above, considering the ﬂexibility and trick of it that feeds into
diﬀerent design contexts, rather than deﬁne Chinese culture in any one overriding sense,
the author attempt to explore a thinking process that is constructed on the understanding
of Chineseness within speciﬁc design contexts.
2.1
Technology
What is technology? Where should one draw the line when deﬁning hi-tech products?
There are no standard answers to these questions. Design researcher Klaus Krippendorﬀ
asserts that every action system beyond the basic apparatus of the body is a technology
[2]. Through various points in history and the development of human society, techno‐
logical artefacts/products become moving targets [3]. In the way that ceramics, sculp‐
tural tools, and printmaking apparatus were state-of-the-art products thousands of years
ago, more recently, ﬁlms, and electrical goods were considered high-tech. Now,
however, when people talk about high-tech products, we are not talking about these
technologies. Most of the time, we are talking about our imagination of technology rather
than a technology. The forms of high-tech devices are not derived from how they are
produced and what they do, but from their users’ ability to conceptualize and handle
them, which we called the interface. Therefore, we noticed that sometimes, as most of
the users hardly know the core technique or manufacture of a product, what they directly
connect with the product is through its interface, rather than through the inner workings.
Tracing back to the ﬁrst Mac, which brought together a number of technical threads
in the computer that developed in the 1960s and 1970s, sparking new movements in
computing, which is as we know today ‘user leads’ design thinking. As one of its
designers, Jef Raskin remembered:
There were to be no peripheral slots so that customers never had to see the inside of
the machine (although external ports would be provided); there was a ﬁxed memory size
so that all applications would run on all Macintoshes; the screen, keyboard, and mass
storage device (and, we hoped, a printer) were to be built in so that the customer got a
truly complete system, and so that we could control the appearance of characters and
graphics [4].
On this point, hi-tech is just an inner design element, which needs to be ‘well-
packed’, to be considered comprehensively by designers, and then expressed through
an interface or interaction design in the purpose of commercial attraction. For a designer,
there should be no good or bad technology, but only better or worse design choices.
Moreover, for dealing with local cultural related design, it is about how to represent
390
W. Yao and G. Lu

interfaces or interactions to users, with both ‘well-packaged’ technology and local
cultural consideration within.
2.2
Globalisation, Localisation and Glocalisation
We cannot ignore the fact that there are billions of the world’s people living in diﬀerent
social and cultural contexts who are quick to passively accept the exports that are full
of western axiology. Today, no matter whether in terms of the image of hi-tech or the
way of producing it, innovative design is taking centre-stage in the Western-World
standards. Maybe from the Western side, globalisation indicates jumping out of the
western culture and understanding others. However, from a non-western, for instance,
the Chinese side, it means more to consider the western way, as the western world is the
one outside Chinese and which leads the mainstream global market today. China has a
population of 1.4-billion and a huge number of individual local cultures on top of the
usual diversities of gender, age, area, education and so on. However, there exist common
inﬂuences from globalisation/westernisation in today’s Chinese generations as well: the
people inherit speciﬁc Chinese characteristics such as strong consciousness of family,
high respect for the older intelligence, etc., yet have experienced huge changes during
the last thirty years; their lifestyles have shifted and they have had to accept western
designs as well as western ways of life in a very short time. Thus, they advocate western
technology as well as maintaining pride in Chinese traditions. These global inﬂuences
comprise the Chinese culture today and are also the causes of estrangement.
We could argue that globalisation causes cultural homogeneity and destroys cultural
diversity/heterogeneity in the process, by denying or ignoring cultural identity, or
abstracting the cultural identity into a universal. A typical example is the similarity of
products and shops in diﬀerent countries of international brands to suit the purposes of
global branding strategy. However, simultaneously, we cannot ignore the fact that glob‐
alisation has also fragmented the world landscapes into smaller cultural unites [5], and
made culture the most important asset to work with in design’s sphere [6], For instance,
glocalism in design is a result and part of globalisation. It promotes local identity and
highlights cultural values. This occurs maybe because of local designers attempts to save
the national identity of products from the homogeneity of the global market; or alter‐
natively, for the local users’ better adaption. This trend also leads back via the abstrac‐
tions of localisation into the global market, in order to increase and attract the global
users’ interests and curiosities in local culture.
2.3
Chinoiserie and Chineseness
Chinoiserie was a visual and aesthetic reﬂection of Chinese culture into design from a
western perspective, as well as a westerners’ Chinese cultural transfer in terms of
symbolic aspects: both the decoration of 18th century and contemporary luxury design
are characterised by the use of fanciful imagery of an imaginary China. It is a French
term, referring to a recurring theme in European artistic styles from the 17th century,
since when European design, especially the luxury end, was inﬂuenced by Chinese
aesthetics and designed through Chinese cultural transfer by European methods of the

391

crafts people. “Chinoiserie is a technical sophistication of Chinese traditional pattern”
[7]. Chinoiserie satisﬁed the western curiosity about Chinese traditional cultural ster‐
eotypes. It is a quite visually symbolic format with whimsical contrasts of scale, and by
the imitation of Chinese porcelain and the use of lacquer-like materials and decoration,
e.g. a fairyland in fanciful mountainous, landscapes with cobweb bridges, carrying
ﬂower parasols, lolling in ﬂimsy bamboo pavilions, dragons and phoenixes, etc. [7].
Today, Chinoiserie is still evident in western luxury products for its Chinese and
oriental allure. Local designers in China explore Chinoiserie as well, being even much
more fascinated with it than in the west. This kind of designing Chinoiserie can be
regarded as a cultural symbolic transfer. The new Chinoiserie in China today is also a
part of Chineseness in design as well, in terms of catering to people’s impression about
Chinese culture. However, Chineseness relates to or reﬂects Chinese cultural characters
rather more than visual symbols, in terms of both an outlook of design and reﬂection of
its cultural intelligence and wealth. If we look into our immersed culture now, ﬁrstly,
today’s China sees today’s politics, social status, philosophy, and behaviours inﬂuenced
deeply by both multiple historical and other factors of globalisation. Chineseness today
both inherits the traditions, as well as maintaining a great diﬀerence from what it was
centuries before. For instance, we all know that the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s
and 1970s left a disjuncture among the scholarship and scholar class. That means the
emphasis of the Chinese traditional philosophies is much weaker than how it was at the
much older time. Yet after the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, starting from the end
of the 1970s, globalisation brought western ways and values to Chinese people’s lives.
Some of the traditional Chinese elements have turned out to be little more than stereo‐
types, rather than the genuine Chineseness manifest today. On the other hand, it is not
surprising to ﬁnd some of the original and strongest elements of Chinese cultural
elements, such as Taoist harmony with nature, the wisdom of Buddhism, Zen, and
Confucianism, etc. that exported from China and into the world, represented as much
better designs in Japan rather than in China. The periphery of a cultural character and
icon tends much more ambiguous with the cultural transmission.
3
Chinese Cultural Transferring Design
3.1
Chinese Symbolic Transfer into Design
Cultural symbolic transfer can be a good way to deﬁne products in the homogeneous
global market. Its importance is not to pursue how much the design reﬂects the cultural
elements, but to ﬁnd valuable cultural elements that make the design diﬀerent or reﬂect
back the users’ images about Chineseness. On this point, designers transfer cultural
elements into product design to distinguish it, adding commercial allure (Fig. 1).
392

transfer.
3.2
Chinese Behavioural Transfer into Design
If we look from the perspective of users’ experiences, and see products in terms of
technological mediation, design evolves through users’ experiences and users’ interac‐
tion with design. In this way, Chinese cultural transfer into design should be considered
on the level of users’ behaviour. On this aspect, design focuses on reﬂecting and
extending the thinking around Chinese behavioural transfer into and how it can be better
adapted by Chinese users. To integrate the user’s behaviour with design, the designers
should research through user experience, search and abstract the relevant cultural
elements surrounding users and then accommodate those into a design, with the ultimate
goal of users’ better acceptance of products (Fig. 2).

transfer.

3.3
Chinese Philosophical Transfer into Design
Moreover, the designers, designs and users were all immersed in a big philosophical/
political mix of diﬀerent factors that subtly inﬂuenced the designer’s way of creativity,
or the people’s understanding and acceptance of design. However, this complexity also
contributes to the wealth of the philosophical and political cultural transfer as design
communication and a community platform to exploring Chineseness (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3. The relationship of designer, design, users and cultural elements in terms of political/
philosophical transfer.
4
An Emerging Model of Chineseness
Simultaneously, in order to structure them, the author attempted to search the models of the
classification/definition of culture in the sociological research sphere. Raymond Williams’
social cultural theory is a very inspiring one. His Marxist critique of culture studies
(cultural materialism) viewed culture as a ‘productive process’, as well as defined three
terms of culture: “the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity, the
particular way of life of a people, period or group, and the process of a society’s intellec‐
tual, spiritual and aesthetic development” [8]. Later researcher Spencer-Oatey’s extended
the concept of culture as a three-layer cultural model (2000). She combined both basic
assumptions and values in one ‘segment’ of culture. In her model, ‘beliefs, attitudes and
conventions’ influence another layer, consisting of “systems and institutions”, which in
turn are encircled by a split outer layer of culture. In the split outer layer of culture, “arte‐
facts & products” is located on the one side and “rituals & behaviour” on the other side.
The model also contains another ‘mental’ level of culture: ‘attitudes, beliefs and behav‐
ioural conventions’, which makes a useful distinction between values on the one hand, and
their expression in a more precise, but at a non-implemented level on the other [9]. This can
be regarded as the extension of Williams’ theory. Dahl reviewed Spencer-Oatey’s model
394
W. Yao and G. Lu

that it ‘describes culture as a shared set of basic assumptions and values, making the level
of culture more practical’. As well as, it is the combination of a number of ‘additional
factors that apart from values and resultant behaviour and artefacts, including a description
of the functions that culture performs’ [10].
In addition, in design research area, Lin and Leong deﬁned three cultural levels for
their culture-oriented design model:
• Physical or material culture
• Social or behavioural culture, including human relationships and social organization
• Spiritual culture—including art and religion [11].
Hence, inspired by Williams, Spencer-Oatey and Lin’s work, the author located ‘how
to manifest Chineseness into design’ as the following three-layer structure: symbolic
layer, behavioural layer, and philosophical/political layer. This structure is a view to
characterise Chineseness in terms of design practice. This also oﬀers a platform to
combine the fuzzy set of culturally oriented design concepts with a number of additional
relevant research/design methods and knowledge.
This framework is a hybrid and culmination of research through design. Through
analysing, combining, simplifying and structuring the ideas that arise from the previous
chapters, this interpretive framework clariﬁes the diﬀerent statuses of designing
Chineseness into three layers: symbolic, behavioural and philosophical/political. It
performs as a platform bringing a category of diﬀerent discursive considerations of
design, theories and methods to the research, in order to raise more possibilities within
design practices. It also identiﬁes a theoretical thread that divides culture into diﬀerent
layers, representing open-ended and ongoing inquiries, posing relevant questions about
culturally orientated design (Fig. 4).

This analytic framework can be dynamic, less of a hierarchical method. For design
practical work always brings out more questions about the Chinese cultural and behav‐
ioural complexity, as well as broadens the research ﬁle. This method explores the mani‐
festation of Chineseness into a structural manner (a system) that enables more apposite
design methods.

Conclusion
This paper describes three ways of exploring the transfer of Chinese culture into design:
symbolic, behavioural and political/philosophical. They culminate in an enabling devel‐
opmental structure through which designers can deal with Chinese cultural complexity
in design. This is for designers investigating relations between culture and design
through an experiential perspective of Chinese culture in terms of developing a new
understanding of ‘Chineseness’. Designers in practices can manifest their own under‐
standing of Chineseness through design, for adding special values for design from the
perspectives of regarding the diﬀerent kinds of relationship between the four factors:
designer, design, users and cultural elements. ‘Chineseness’ in this work, can be re-
mapped as a form of communication that deals with Chinese culture in design. It is not
just along with historical stereotypes, nor a remote copy of other countries’ successful
cultural transfers, but rather should be inseparable from the radical social phenomena
and design culture already emerging within contemporary China. The author’s work is
ultimately allowing Chineseness to be less implied and instead, to be made manifest, in
terms of what behaviours over symbolism and decoration. This paper also remarks some
stereotypes, generalisations and categorisations when designers deal with cross-cultural
design from both non-Chinese and Chinese angles.

Abstract. Zhuangzi is a Chinese cultural treasure. Zhuangzi is of inestimable
value due to its preservation of ancient mythological material, its literary and
philosophical innovation, its eccentric imagery and rich creativity, and the
strong narrative quality of its many allegories. It was often the subject of
illustrations in classical works. Efforts to preserve the messages of Zhuangzi, to
transform its abstract ideas into tangible forms as illustrations, and to excavate
its treasures have proven to be a great struggle. The present study uses the notion
of “Poetic techniques of shape-spirit transformation” proposed by Yeh et al.
(2011) as its primary reference point. In her theory of the form and essence of
traditional Chinese paintings, she ﬁrst takes inventory to conduct a comparative
analysis of modern illustrations derived from Zhuangzi, and then advances a
further step toward creating a design model for transforming the artistry of
Zhuangzi into illustrations.

Introduction
Zhuangzi has had a profound inﬂuence on Chinese culture. Familiar proverbs such as
“a mantis attempting to stop a chariot”, “Zhuang Zhou dreams of a butterﬂy”, and
“abandoning the sacriﬁcial vessels for the saucepans”, among others, all originated
from Zhuangzi, and there is no shortage of similar examples. However, due to the
length of years, its difﬁcult classical language is an obstacle even for many native
Chinese speakers, giving rise to commentaries, references, and adaptations. Among the
commentaries are Zhuangzi Commentary by Guo Xiang of the Western Jin Dynasty,
Commentary on True Scripture of Southern Florescence by Cheng Xuanying of the
Tang Dynasty, and Zhuangzi Modern Annotated Edition and Translation by Chen
Guying in modern times. Zhuangzi has been referenced countless times. For example,
the line “The immortals leave the world and do not look back, but in the world, life and
death are like morning and night” from “Comments from a Visit to the City of

Immortals” by Su Dongpo derives from the phrase “life and death are day and night”
from “The Great Original Teacher” chapter of Zhuangzi. Similarly, the phrase “Who
wakes up ﬁrst from the great dream?” from Romance of the Three Kingdoms references
the phrase “There will be a great awakening, and afterward it will be known that all was
a great dream” from the “Making All Things Even” chapter of Zhuangzi. The story
“Zhuang Zhou Drums on a Bowl and Attains the Great Dao” in Feng Menglong’s
Stories to Caution the World is an adaptation of the line “beating on a drum and
singing” from Zhuangzi. This story was later turned into numerous plays and movies.
However, in this age of digital multimedia, the cultural resources of a wide-ranging,
profound, diverse, conceptually rich, and idiosyncratic work like Zhuangzi have yet to
be fully tapped. Under these conditions, retracing how the abstract artistic elements of
Zhuangzi have been transformed into concrete illustrations, and then into outstanding
cultural products such as cartoon animation, is a path of inquiry worth pursuing.
At present, animated versions of Zhuangzi are relatively few. The best-known are
Tsai Chih Chung’s Zhuangzi Says from 2004, the corporate anime xxxHOLiC:
Shunmuki from 2010, and Zhuang Zhou Dreams of a Butterﬂy by the China Central
Academy of Fine Arts from 2015. In general, the screen adaptations of the artistry of
Zhuangzi have not yet reached their full potential. The present study employs the
design model of “Poetic techniques of shape-spirit Transformation” proposed by Mo-Li
Yeh in 2011 as its standard of judgment, undertaking a multi-faceted comparison of the
successes and failures of these three two-dimensional (2D) works (illustrations). Based
on an analysis of the successes and failures of the three works, the present study
assembles a theory and produces a model for adapting the artistry of Zhuangzi featuring
four ideal illustrations.

Zhuangzi and Related Visual Works
Zhuangzi’s surname was Zhou, and his courtesy name was Zixiu. He lived in the town
of Meng in the state of Song. His year of birth is not known, but he probably lived at
the same time as Mencius (372–289 BC), and worked as a supervisor of lacquer work
in Meng. He lived in poverty, and made shoes in exchange for rice when he lacked
money. In fact, he looked down on wealth, social status, fame, and power. The His-
torical Records state that King Wei of Chu once asked Zhuang Zhou to become a
minister, but Zhuang Zhou replied: “I would rather amuse myself in a ﬁlthy ditch than
be subject to the rules of the leader of a state. I will never take ofﬁce, and will continue
to enjoy my freedom.” He did his best to protect himself in turbulent times, to attain
release, and to pursue spiritual freedom and ease. The dao that is ever-present in
Zhuangzi’s philosophy represents the origin of the world and its essence, and also
refers to the highest ideal in life. It is generally thought that Zhuangzi developed and
innovated upon the philosophy of Laozi. However, Ch’ien Mu and Feng Youlan
believe that in terms of the history of philosophy, Zhuangzi came before Laozi, and that
he formed a critical link between pre-Qin philosophers and Daoists. The 33 chapters in
his work Zhuangzi are separated into inner, outer, and miscellaneous chapters. It is
generally believed that the inner chapters are the work of Zhuangzi, whereas the outer
398
M.-L. Yeh et al.

and miscellaneous chapters were written by disciples. Throughout Zhuangzi, allegories
are abundant, which is why the work professes to be “nine-tenths allegory” in “Alle-
gories”. Although there are relatively few animated versions of Zhuangzi, their number
is considerable in comparison with those of other classical works, and the quality is
high. Among these are comic books that have been adapted into works of animation,
for instance, the adaptation of Tsai Chih Chung’s comic book Zhuangzi Says (2004),
the adaptation of xxxHOLiC: Shunmuki by Japanese manga studio Clamp, and Xia
Chong Guo by the studio Ink Man. There are also animated adaptations that are not
based on comics, such as Zhuang Zhou Dreams of a Butterﬂy by the China Central
Academy of Fine Arts and The Cowboy’s Flute by Shanghai Animation Film Studio.
These works have all been widely praised. Zhuangzi Says in particular was appreciated
by old and young alike, and turned into a three-dimensional (3D) version in 2010.

Poetic Techniques of Shape-Spirit Transformation
In the chapter “The World”, Zhuangzi says in his own work Zhuangzi that it “employs
words to offer constant insight, with important quotations to communicate the truth,
and an abundance of allegories.” As can be seen here, allegories occupy a key position
in the artistry of Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi’s allegories display a magnanimous, peculiar
imagination and a style of “wild ideas and an eccentric ﬂow of thought” which is
described in Generalization of Art/Generalization of Prose by Liu Xizai. The myste-
rious philosophy behind the allegories, while constituting an advantage for adaptations,
also presents numerous challenges for the creation of a perfect adaptation. Chen et al.
(2012) proposes investigating the sensory characteristics of “emotions,” “reason,”
“events,” and “scenes” in the imagery and ideas of poetry, and using the attributes of
sensory products to analyze four ideally designed products whose design concepts are
based on said poetry. Although this model is highly reliable, and some aspects of it are
praiseworthy, if used to adapt an expansive, unbridled work of classical Chinese prose
such as Zhuangzi, the amount of work involved would be extraordinary. Comparatively
speaking, the design model of “Poetic techniques of shape-spirit transformation”,
which is present as “adapting the form and essence of poetry for design” in this paper,
constructed by Yeh et al. (2011) in Applying Poetic Techniques of Shape-Spirit
Transformation in Cultural Creative Design proves easier to use when applied to
animated adaptations of the artistry of Zhuangzi. “Poetic techniques of shape-spirit
transformation” are based on the poet’s state of mind as expressed through the poetry,
and involve an investigation of the “compositional approach” and an integration of
visual sensory activity and imagination as a designer would undertake to deeply
penetrate the interior essence of the subject of analysis and assimilate the results, that is,
to conduct an “analysis of the structure of meaning.” Then comes the process of
“putting pen to paper,” as a method of speciﬁcally applying design adaptations, and
“adapting the external forms and internal meanings of poetry,” as a method of actually
determining related elements such as imagery, material quality, functions, emotions,
etc. Finally, the design is put into practice in a “poetic cultural product.” This model
Design and Application of the Illustrations of Zhuangzi

can be separated into four concrete forms based on cause and effect, namely, “using
form to depict form,” “using form to depict essence,” “attaining essence to depict
form,” and “depending on essence and emitting essence,” that is, the four main models
of “using concrete images to depict concrete images,” “transforming abstract images
into concrete images,” “transforming concrete images into abstract images,” and “using
abstract images to depict abstract images.” Although there are four main models, there
are only two main elements, “form” and “essence.” When adapting the surface “things”
in Zhuangzi as well as the “situations” behind them from text into imagery, simplifying
the four main elements of “emotions,” “reason,” “events,” and “scenes” into the two
main elements of “form” and “essence” not only reduces the number of complex
procedures but also makes the train of thought easier to follow and puts greater stress
on the focal points.

An Analysis of the 2D Structure of Current Zhuangzi
Illustrations in Works of Animation
There is an extremely wide range of different illustrations in Zhuangzi, covering nearly
every category of literary and commercial illustrations. Works of commercial illus-
tration include animation storyboards, comic book design, and so on; this is the main
multimedia area in which illustrations are applied. The Chinese word for “animation” is
derived from the same word in English. In Latin, the word “animate” means “to make
something become active.” All animation achieves the effect of movement by dis-
playing static pictures in succession. Moreover, the word “cartoon” is generally used
for humorous or satirical works adapted from political caricatures, and its original
meaning refers to a type of 2D drawing technique. In the broad sense, animation
includes ﬁlm cartoons as well as animated ﬁlms, and both adapt still pictures into
moving pictures through a process of static images in motion.
Animation generally uses exaggeration and richly creative activity and language to
win the audience’s appreciation. It does not rely on pure acting skill to brilliantly depict
fantastical characters, and such a format seems more compatible with the stories of
Zhuangzi than live-action ﬁlm. In addition to this high degree of appropriateness,
animation is also unique in that it has a consistent visual style, a rich array of colors,
and a high degree of completeness. Therefore, the present study focuses on the 2D
illustrated portions of the works of animation derived from three Zhuangzi stories,
using the animation structure category chart in Application of Chuang-tzu 2D ani-
mation by Liu and Yeh (2015). Speciﬁcally, there are ﬁve main types of animation
structures: theme and story, animation style, sound structure, static picture structure,
and dynamic techniques. These models are used to conduct a comparative investigation
of similarities, differences, successes, and failures in the current adaptation processes of
the artistry of Zhuangzi. To put emphasis on key points, the present study deconstructs
and analyzes three works of animation in detail, that is, the adaptation of Tsai Chih
Chung’s comic Zhuangzi Says, the OVA adaptation of Clamp’s manga xxxHOLiC:
Shunmuki, and the ink painting animation Zhuang Zhou Dreams of a Butterﬂy by the

China Central Academy of Fine Arts. We have not analyzed the sound structure or
dynamic techniques of three works of animation; we mainly analyzed the 2D illus-
tration portions, speciﬁcally the theme and story, the illustration style, the static picture
structure, and the appropriateness of the format for adapting stories from Zhuangzi. The
study materials is the speciﬁc parts from three animations with the same subject that
Zhuang Zhou dreams of a butterﬂy. The process of analysis is shown in Fig. 1.

Investigation of Application to Illustrations
Through an analysis of the illustrations above, we can ﬁrst identify some commonal-
ities in the approaches of the three illustrations to adapt the spirit of Zhuangzi. First,
there is a degree of elegance and ease in the lines of the character designs in every case,
which serves to adapt the free and easy-going nature of Zhuangzi’s spiritual pursuits
and his ﬂamboyantly expansive writing style. Next, the characters are exaggerated and
the designs are relatively simple: this is appropriate for a work of animation and is also
in accordance with the eccentric, outlandish imagery of Zhuangzi. Additionally, in
terms of composition, mid- to close-range perspectives are prevalent, and the com-
positions mainly use the golden ratio. The colors are relatively consistent, which serves
to preserve the harmony of the images. Finally, when presenting conversations and
philosophical details, the backgrounds tend to be empty or drawn in freehand, and such
settings are used to place emphasis upon the storyline and the characters, or perhaps to
express the ﬁctional nature of the allegories.
The weakness of these generally successful attempts is that despite their capture of
Zhuangzi’s free and easy-going nature, they overlook his magniﬁcent prose and jocular
style. The use of ﬁxed settings to place limits on time and space represents the essence
of Zhuangzi but neglects the form. In their attempts to represent the spirit of Zhuangzi’s
Daoism, they neglected to represent the eccentricity and wildness of the Zhuangzi
School.
The present study attempts to carry on the free and easy-going character of the 2D
composition of these illustrations, as well as their temporal twists and turns and bold
usage of composition, by applying Mo-Li Yeh’s design model of “Poetic Techniques
of Shape-Spirit Transformation”, which adapts the “form” and “essence” of poetry, to
some of the words and implications of Zhuangzi to create illustrations. Speciﬁcally, we
aim to construct a more complete conceptual model of adapting the spirit of Zhuangzi
by (1) adapting the original text of Zhuangzi using the four concrete methods of “using
form to depict form,” “using form to depict essence,” “attaining essence to depict
form,” and “depending on essence and emitting essence,” and (2) undergoing the two
adaptation stages of “analysis of the structure of meaning” and “adapting the external
forms and internal meanings of poetry” in each method to create illustrations. The
process is shown in Fig. 2.

Conclusion
Qian Mu also states in his Comprehensive Study of Zhuangzi and Laozi that Zhuangzi’s
prose “is just like a cup of water” and that “it is always ﬂowing.” “But it is as if this cup
of water is always changing. It takes on every sort of strange ﬂavor, but still you can’t
help but enjoy drinking it…” Zhuangzi is a fascinating piece of work that is greatly
eccentric with a consistent vision. The present study has been guided by the design
model of “Poetic techniques of shape-spirit transformation,” creating a series of
illustrations derived from the text in an attempt to improve the currently existing
illustrations. This study also has some limitations. Simple extractions of 2D illustrated
images from works of animation take these images out of context, making it difﬁcult to
appreciate the 2D characteristics of the work of animation as a whole. However, to shed
light on the themes in question, this study has tentatively extracted representative
images, undertaking a general analysis of their composition as static pictures and
discussing visual adaptations of Zhuangzi from the perspective of essence and form. In
so doing, this study has presented an optimal point of view.

Abstract. This paper identiﬁes factors important in low-literacy mobile user
interaction design and development. It explains the limitations and recurrent
design problems from developing countries, focusing on Ethiopia as a primary
case study, with special consideration for the designer perspective. This
exploratory research effort examines the match and mismatch in usability design
guidelines for mobile interaction in developing countries. It also identiﬁes the
design and usability factors that affect mobile service (m-service) delivery in
developing countries: context gaps, designer gaps, and technology gaps. Fur-
ther, the paper examines the designer perception towards design guidance
requirement and application. In so doing, it seeks to provide input for design
guidance development in a generic way such that mobile user interface designer
understanding will be enhanced and m-service delivery in developing countries
will be more usable.

Introduction
According to a report of the International Telecommunication Union, by the end of
2015, the mobile cellular subscription was projected to reach 91.8 and 73.5 per 100
inhabitants of developing countries and of Africa, respectively [1]. The numbers have
been growing fast each year. The number of mobile subscriptions, deployment of
extensive mobile infrastructure, and prevalence of low-cost mobile devices reﬂect great
promise toward addressing the gaps in delivering different social (such as health care
and agriculture) and economic (such as ﬁnancial and banking) services. Despite the

overwhelming number of mobile users (mobile subscribers) their mobile service
adoption (use pattern) has received little consideration within the many efforts of
researchers addressing technology impact in developing society [2]. It is thus essential
to examine these ever-growing resources and focus on better service adoption and
diffusion of mobile services to meet the promise.
In general, designing mobile solutions for developing countries has unique chal-
lenges: power, device capability, privacy/security, and uncertain network communi-
cation are only a few [3–5]. Beyond these technological inefﬁciencies there are also
limitations in terms of computing experience (most users have never used computing
devices) and literacy. In most developing countries about half of the society is illiterate
[3] (including for the country considered in this paper, Ethiopia [6]). Other factors like
language and social value differences are additional challenges that hinder good pro-
vision of m-services in the region.
While a large percentage of users whose primary platform for accessing informa-
tion and communication is the mobile phone, the previously mentioned challenges and
limitations affect mobile user interface design. For instance power and device capability
are related to the size and type of interface (multimedia application require a better
device capability, including more power and space consumption). Thus, exploring
mobile user interface usability that helps overcome these challenges is paramount and
is an important element for mobile services adoption and diffusion.
In an effort to address these challenges, one of the suggested solutions is to doc-
ument and codify the design knowledge of human-mobile interaction for mobile
devices in developing nations [7]. This is part of work to lay down a foundation for
building mobile user interface design knowledge for low-literacy. Other researches
pointed out instead of redeploying technologies for developing countries that are meant
to industrialized countries, human-computer interaction methods should focus on
designing technologies that addresses the local contexts [3, 5].
The work reported here represents one component of the effort to support mobile
user interface designer for low-literacy: providing concrete design guidance. We
believe that good design guidance facilitates communication with the designer and can
have great impact on mobile interface design for low-literacy. Since it is rare to ﬁnd
applications (and application designers) centered on rich experience and well-founded
knowledge, extracting design guidance for this user group is difﬁcult. Hence, it is
essential that the development of effective design guidance should be supported by
analysis of the context of use and user and also the local designer practices [8].
To capture knowledge of the current practices and recurrent design problem, we
developed interview guides and interviewed a number of local designers in two stages.
The ﬁrst was informal interviews which were not recorded to get a sense of general
design practices for mobile software developers in Ethiopia. The second phase is
formal semi-structured interview to learn about speciﬁc, common design practices that
should be shared across the community. The interviews of the designers focused on
their design experience and recurrent design problems in designing mobile user
interfaces for low-literacy situations.

Related Work
Despite the signiﬁcant progress of user interface design [9, 10], advances speciﬁc to
low-literacy mobile user interface are not yet comprehensively addressed [9]. Most
low-literacy users from developing regions (that have high illiteracy rate [6]) encoun-
tered difﬁculties in using the most basic features of both mobile and other computing
interfaces (such as making phone call, clicks) are not intuitive to them [11]. In recent
years, a number of efforts in designing interfaces considered the skill, knowledge and
experience of this user group [12–15].
Most literatures in this progress agree mobile user interface design for low-literacy
user group should be different from those of the literate one (which can be commu-
nicated through textual description) [12–14, 16]. Nonetheless, there are also claims that
highlight the challenges of textual interface for literate novice users [15]. Most of these
efforts are based on of ethnographic research [12, 15, 16, 20] and presented the
usability barrier of low-literacy and provide suggestion of design ideas in the form of
general design recommendations and also features that contributed towards the suc-
cessful low-literacy design.
Many researchers have made contributions in the area of interface design for
low-literacy. Huenernfauth [18] outlined design guidelines to design user interface for
illiterate users. Medhi et al. [15] studied and identiﬁed mobile interface usability
challenges of low-literacy and novice mobile users; the work also further suggested
design advices suitable for this user group, which improve the identiﬁed usability
barriers. Chaudry et al. [14] conduct usability evaluation of non-text based graphical
widgets focused on low-literacy user group, and based on the result of the evaluation
some design recommendations are provided. Medhi et al. [12] suggested and tested
text-free user interface design for low-literacy user to access employment information.
Parikh et al. [19] presented the key user interface design features that are important for
low-literacy user and success of managing ﬁnancial institution in rural India. Gitau
et al. [16] explored prospect and challenges of ﬁrst-time mobile-only internet users who
are low-literate and have no experience in other computing devices. Medhi et al.
[15, 20] focused on evaluating and comparing non-literate and semi-literate users using
three design artifacts.
In all, these contributions present usability challenges of low-literacy (such as
visibility of functions, menu navigation, scroll bars, textual presentation) and provide
design recommendation (regarding graphical representations, voice interfaces, avoiding
textual input, minimizing navigation) [12, 14–16, 18–20]. Beyond contextual factors
and generalizability of the research approach, most of these work share notions both in
terms of usability challenges and design recommendations.

Methodology
Our goal in this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the local mobile user
interface designer practices, thoughts, and experiences. We also sought to get this
information in the context of their actual situations, making interview and focused
group discussion an attractive and fruitful methodology that provides a detailed account
Mobile User Interaction Development
411

of their practice and experience. The interview was made in two phases: one was
informal and focused on general design practice and issues, and the other was formal
semi-structured interviews with more detail. The mobile application developers (user
interface designers) and companies were selected by consulting the Ministry of
Communication and Information Technology, who has up-to-date information of the
industry. This information shows there exist only few mobile application developer and
companies in the country. As it is a qualitative research we have sought an adequate
number of samples to better enlighten and understand the approaches under
consideration.
All interviews were conducted by one interviewer; an interview took an average of
ﬁfty-ﬁve minutes (ranging from forty minutes to an hour and half). In an individual
interview consisting of fourteen participants, eleven were male and three were female
with an average age of twenty seven. Participants’ educational background also ranges
from information technology ﬁrst degrees to PhDs (nine BSc., four MSc., one PhD).
Their experience in mobile application development ranges from one year to six years
of experience.
For the two group discussions, one had 6 (1 female, 5 males) and the other had 7
(2 females, 5 males) participants. The two discussions took a total of three hours and
twenty minutes. Three of the participants in the group discussion have a Master’s
degree and all the rest have bachelor degree. Their experience in mobile application
development also ranges from one to six years.

Findings and Discussions
Both the formal and informal interviews and the focus group discussions generally
draw a large amount of qualitative data, on the different issues of the current mobile
user interface design trend and the recurrent design problems. Moreover, it also
unearths the experience and attitude towards the application of design guidance in their
design. This paper summarizes the salient ﬁndings of the current mobile user interface
design trends and their implication for how we can best support the design guidance
development process and product that will help both the Ethiopian low-literate mobile
user and designer.
Based on our research interest, the following four main themes emerged as results
of the analysis: current mobile user interface design practice, classiﬁcation of mobile
users, recurrent design problems in low-literacy mobile user interface design, and
source of design knowledge and its relevance.
4.1
Current Mobile User Interface Design Practice
The interviews and group discussions demonstrated that mobile user interface design is
considered part and parcel of the implementation process, not as independent process to
pursue. No particular emphasis is given for designing the user interface early in the
development and also later in the testing stage. Only one participant mentioned a
different practice than the others, his experience is described as:
412
E.G. Belay et al.

‘I usually try to sketch the user interface on the paper before I start the implementation
process.’ [Participant 3]
The result of the analysis also revealed user interface design is neither a component
of the process nor obtain reasonable attention in development of mobile application.
Designers tend to focus more on the internal implementation aspects of the system.
However, participants from one mobile device manufacturer afﬁliated application
development company mentioned that they only develop for a target device and test the
completed application, no special focus is given for the interface.
‘Mobile Application development is not widely practiced as you know. Thus for the application
we develop we only focus on the functionality of the apps rather than the interface.’ [Partic-
ipant 6]
‘Our mobile application are tested by both internal and external users and we don’t have a
special interface evaluation test rather we run test on the ﬁnal application.’ [Participant 8]
Participants consistently expressed the current mobile user interface design trend
follows traditional application development processes. It is also neglecting people who
have issues as a result of various technical (such as bandwidth limitation, unreliable
connection) and economic (such as device capability, cost of connection) reasons. Even
most typical applications of m-services are based on short message and Unstructured
Supplementary Service Data (USSD) that is practically of no use to low-literacy user
group.
‘Most of the application we developed are not focused on certain user group and did not give a
special attention neither for low-literacy nor rural users unless and otherwise a speciﬁc
application are requested by a certain organization.’ [Participant 10]
‘Many mobile applications such as bank application uses USSD which is pretty much difﬁcult
for low-literate user group.’ [Participant 3]
Participants felt that the available choice of mobile infrastructure and communi-
cation technologies are limited and pose a big challenge in application development.
For example, participants argued that a result of communication bandwidth could
potentially be a problem for not designing either audio or multimedia applications for
the low-literate user group.
‘Most low-literacy mobile users are living in rural area where there is inadequate infras-
tructure, such as 2G mobile network and it is very difﬁcult to design a multimedia interface
having this technology.’ [Participant 5]
All participants somehow highlighted the challenges of designing for diverse
mobile devices that have various features, type and size (screen size), capability
(internal/hardware capability of the device), input methods (touch, keypad). In line with
this, they also highlighted the need for local language (such as Amharic soft keypad)
input mechanism standardization.
‘There is no hard keyboard for Amharic language but there are various soft keyboard which
are diverse and difﬁcult to use that require common standard.’ [Participant 12]

Classiﬁcation of Mobile Users
According to the UNESCO report literacy rate in Ethiopia among the population aged
15 years and older (which is considered as adult) is 49.1 percent - nearly half of the
population [6]. And more than 80 percent of the population of Ethiopia lives in rural
area with low resource setting.
Low-literacy in most mobile interaction design research is deﬁned only from the
educational perspective [12, 14, 18]. Our research considers education as one parameter
and claims other parameters (such as computing literacy, technology exposure, level of
assistance required) to be considered for mobile user classiﬁcation. Based on this we
characterize users in three groups (m-illiterate, m-semi-literate, m-literate) [11]; the
former two are also considered as part of the low-literacy mobile user group. How each
of the additional parameters inﬂuence and impact the mobile interaction design has
been assessed in this research.
While participants agreed on the concept of classifying mobile user groups, they
were also initially thinking the conventional deﬁnition of literacy/illiteracy. After we
presented the deﬁnition they also reﬂect their ideas towards additional parameters.
‘Even people who has moderate education such as high school and haven’t use any computing
device are always encounter in using even the most common functionalities of the mobile.’
[Participant 2]
Participants also argued people who have moderate experience have to be con-
sidered differently in user interface design.
The designers also strongly argued that people who have moderate experience have
to be considered differently in user interface design; however one participant reﬂected
his view which is a bit different from the others – he argued that the difference between
m-semi-literate and m-literate is a matter of experience and did not require a different
design for this user group:
‘It only requires training to use a mobile phone but not required a different design to
accommodate their needs’. [Participant 5]
In all, the result of the analysis highlighted that the different parameters we iden-
tiﬁed can prove useful for the classiﬁcation of mobile user groups, and each charac-
teristic along with the user group lead to informed discussion. The reﬁned version of
the result is shown in Table 1.

Recurrent Design Problems in Low-Literacy Mobile User Interface
Design
There has been a good deal of discussion about the beneﬁts of designing user interfaces
for low-literacy groups, including research and results from the Microsoft India
research group [12, 17, 20]. This research is part of an ongoing effort to provide
plausible design guidance for designers of low-literacy mobile user groups. In our
interviews and focus group discussion, we explore the recurrent design problems that
are important for designing mobile user interface for low-literacy user groups in the
Ethiopian situations.
Generally, the results of the research led us to propose the recurrent design prob-
lems speciﬁc to low-literacy mobile user interface design. Some of the recurrent design
problems that emerged from the analysis of data are summarized and presented in
Table 2. The general and speciﬁc recurrent design problems described by the designer
are intended to supplement the design guidance development process and results. This
analysis provides design insights by highlighting possible solutions.

Source of Design Knowledge and Its Relevance
In this section we have explored the designers’ requirements for proven solution and
their current source of design principle and guidance. Participants are not aware of the
availability of any mobile design guidance. Most of the designers’ inspiration comes
from their intuition and web search. Few of the participants describe general design
advice like is found in an android guidebook or web site.
Some did mention browsing the web to see how to implement design features.
Some describe mixed approaches that tend to be incremental; design and implemen-
tation approaches together. No clear distinction between design and implementation
seemed to emerge from discussions; e.g., ‘I haven’t used any design guidance in my
design, what I usually did is browse a similar application when I started to implement.’
[Participant 6] Participants are not aware of design structures like interaction patterns.
Some identiﬁed software design patterns but not interaction design patterns.

Conclusion
This paper presented the designer perspective toward mobile interaction design for
low-literacy situations. We described current mobile user interface design trends and
some resulting recurrent design problems that emerged from the analysis of local
designers’ perception. We envisage that these recurrent design problems are considered
and will be leveraged in design structure development for mobile interaction design for
low-literacy.
The paper also describes the feasible and essential parameters that help to char-
acterize the mobile user group. Moreover the paper brieﬂy presented how these local
designers perceived and make use of design guidance and principle. We are hopeful
that the results of this paper will provide initial insights to the development of effective
and formal design guidance that is useful (and used) by designers.
Our future work will combine the results of these ﬁndings, analysis of the context
of use and user with theoretical and practical rationale to propose design patterns for
mobile low-literacy. More broadly, we plan to pursue ways to support designers in
crafting mobile technologies to support health, agriculture, and business [11, 21, 22].

Abstract. Knowledge management systems are built to organized knowledge
for certain companies or organizations. This study investigates an experience
sharing application on the smart phone to help manage the experience of elevator
maintenance workers. Results indicate that the training mechanism (one master
teaches one apprentice) and nomadic property of maintenance work contribute to
the design and usage of the application. Besides, the potential use cases of the
application include search, ask and share experience. The experience sharing
application will help improve workers’ expertise and guarantee their job safety.

Introduction
Knowledge is a key resource for companies but how to ﬁnd and leverage the knowledge
within the company and the staﬀ is a problem. Under the background of Industrial 4.0,
companies pay lots eﬀorts to build Smart Factory to provide assistance to people and
machines to execute tasks [1, 2]. This is achieved by systems taking considerations of
context aware information. Corporations in software engineering or consulting have
developed knowledge management systems to share experience among teams in an
organization. But as far as we know few study investigates the knowledge management
systems to the blue-collar worker, especially maintenance workers, and maintenance
companies are in desperate need of knowledge management systems.
Take the elevator industry as an example, by the end of 2014, total number of eleva‐
tors in China reaches 3.6 million, ranking ﬁrst in the world and grows with the speed of
20 % annually [3]. However, due to the lack of eﬀective maintenance, elevator entrap‐
ment failure and fatal accidents occur frequently. For example, on average forty trapped
people are rescued in elevators in Guangzhou city every day [3]. At the same time,
elevator companies experience a serious shortage of elevator maintenance workers,
especially the experienced ones. The inadequacy of individual experience not only
reduces the maintenance eﬃciency but also threatens the safety of workers. Inﬂuenced
by the nomadic property of maintenance work (i.e. workers go to various equipment
locations to complete repair missions with one partner) and the educational level of the
workers, knowledge management is a big problem for maintenance workers.

The web-based community provide good directions for the companies’ knowledge
management [4, 5]. Moreover, the development of mobile internet and the popularity
of smart phones promote the applications of social networks used during the work. The
paper aims to explore the nature of maintenance work and provide directions for the
design of the maintenance knowledge management application for maintenance
workers.

Literature Review
2.1
Maintenance Work and Maintenance Knowledge
Maintenance ensures proper operations and keep the product’ life cycle down through
regularly maintenance interventions (corrective, preventive, conditions based, etc.) [4].
Intervention measures depend on the model and the condition of maintenance equip‐
ment, which puts forward high requests to maintenance workers’ skills. Waeyenbergh
and Pintelon [4] proposed that the maintenance knowledge (know-how) was acquired
through work itself rather than books. Maintenance workers need to reach the locations
of equipment to be repaired. Sharing knowledge and learning from each other become
diﬃcult for geographically dispersed workers.
In conclusion, user-centered product design needs to consider the characteristics of
nomadic maintenance work to better develop the experience sharing application.
2.2
Factors Eﬀect Knowledge Management
The design of knowledge management application will be aﬀected by various factor.
De Long and Fehey [8] pointed out that “Investment in information technology would
not change the culture by itself.” Thus, knowledge management must align with culture
norms of the company if they are to be achieved. Companies’ culture norms dictate and
distinguish the knowledge belongs to organization or individual, we need to understand
the culture of organization before knowledge management.
Besides, characteristics of web systems determine the eﬀect of knowledge manage‐
ment. The collaborative learning systems can be generally categorized into two types:
Wiki and Community Question Answering (CQA) system. Wiki is an editable website
allow people to build up knowledge collaboratively [9] and considered as one of best
examples of collective intelligence and a structured way to record knowledge, but most
experience of maintenance workers are unstructured. Cole [10] has described a failed
experiment to use Wiki technology in higher education for not considering the actual
condition of target users, so Wiki may not be a good tool for maintenance workers to
share experiences. On the contrary, CQA system is a service where people can ask
questions and share knowledge by providing answers to questions asked by other users
[10] and Srba and Bieliková [11] described an potential of CQA systems to be applied
in educational environment. Thus CQA systems are suitable to answer subjective, non-
factual and context-aware queries which might be more suitable for experience sharing.
Moreover, users’ knowledge acquisition scenarios of should be combined with the
Exploration of Smart Phone Knowledge
419

system design [11]. It is important to explore the character of users and using scenarios
before the knowledge management application development.
The main goal of this paper is to explore the design of experience sharing application
for elevator maintenance workers, speciﬁcally the nature of maintenance work and
potential use scenarios of systems. With the help of the smart phone application, main‐
tenance companies could eﬀectively manage maintenance knowledge to improve
workers’ expertise and guarantee their job safety.

Methodology
This study used the observation method and the focus group interviews to understand
the the characteristics of the elevator maintenance work. The observation method was
conducted to understand maintenance workers’ workﬂow and tools during the work.
Since workers with diﬀerent expertise may have diﬀerent experience in knowledge
management, the focus groups interviews were carried out for the experienced workers’
group and the new coming workers’ group separately to gain their idea.
3.1
Participants
Six elevator maintenance workers (male) were recruited and classiﬁed into two groups
according to their level of expertise in elevator maintenance. Three younger workers
(ages 28–30) who had less than ﬁve-year experience were assigned in the new coming
workers group. Three experienced workers (ages 43–49) who had more than twenty-
year experience were assigned in the experienced workers group. Participants are from
the same elevator company. Since most elevator maintenance workers were male, this
study just invited male workers.
3.2
Procedure
The experiment was conducted in the Training Building of the elevator company. First,
the on-site work observation was at the elevator machine room. One experienced worker
(29-year experience) demonstrated the basic maintenance process of elevator machine
room and introduced the tools used during the work. Two instructors observed the whole
maintenance process and asked questions when they did not understand. The whole
process was recorded by video camera.
Second, the focus interview was conducted for two groups separately in meeting
room and the whole process was recorded by the voice recorder. Two instructors inter‐
viewed maintenance workers in three aspects:
1. work condition (e.g., “Can you describe your typical working day?”; “How the
maintenance work is allocated?”; “How is your workload?”; “What tools are used
during the work?”; “How often do you see your co-workers and in what ways?”;
“How do you get in touch with your co-workers?”);
2. maintenance knowledge and knowledge management (e.g., “What is the training
procedure?”; “Describe your experience in being a master or an apprentice.” “How
420
Z. Li et al.

do you solve your problems encountered during the work”’; “Do you have experi‐
ence in asking co-workers for help and how often do this kind of things happen?”
“Will you share your experience in solving problems to others and how?”)
3. attitude toward the experience sharing application (e.g., “What do you usually use
your smart phone for?”; “What is your attitude toward experience sharing among
workers?”, “What do you think if there is an experience sharing application that
could help you share experience or learn something?”).

Results
From the on-site observation and focus interview, this study gained some insights into
the nature of nomadic maintenance and maintenance workers’ characteristic. This study
organized our ﬁndings in the following sections:
4.1
Nature of Nomadic Maintenance Work
Diﬀerent from oﬃce staﬀ work in the oﬃce, the maintenance workers went to around
four designed locations to complete their repair missions everyday. Besides, the work
was planned to carry out regularly alone or with a partner. This nomadic characteristic
of maintenance work made it hard for workers to communicate face-to-face. Thus smart
phone became an important tool to their work. All of them had smart phones and had
habits in using social applications.
In the management level, the maintenance workers were organized in teams (around
nine workers) which were responsible for regional elevator maintenance work. In each
team, tasks were assigned by the team leader through smart phones. Workers used the
instant message, like We-Chat (Chinese popular mobile text and voice messaging
communication service), for communication. Besides, workers’ hands were full of oil
when they were working, so voice messaging of We-Chat made communications easier.
They also needed instant message to send pictures to the team leader if they need to
order parts.
If a part of the elevator is broken, I need to send the leader the photo of the part by We-Chat to
order it. We also have the We-Chat group for group communicate. But too many people are in
it, and it is hard to ﬁnd the history message or get the feedback immediately. (29, 3-year expe‐
rience)
Maintenance workers used phone calls and social applications for work communi‐
cate, and it was the only way for them to contact to the outside.
4.2
Maintenance Knowledge
Because maintenance workers were exposed to dangerous conditions during repair
work, workers wore professional cloth with a bag of professional equipment and the
maintenance work follows standard procedures. The rules of the maintenance work were
that problem solving went ﬁrst and followed the regular inspection routine. The expe‐
rience was precious and extremely useful in troubleshooting, because problems were
Exploration of Smart Phone Knowledge
421

various, which needed the workers knew a wide range models of machine. Moreover,
workers needed to use sensory perception such as visual check, sound listening and the
sense of touch to diagnose troubles. Aristotle (1978) suggested experience emanated
from sensory perception. This kind experience was hard to explain. The maintenance
knowledge was accumulated during practical working, so the longer the worker worked,
the more experienced the workers were. Due to the nomadic characteristics of mainte‐
nance work, it was hard to share their own experience to others by traditional commu‐
nication.
4.3
Current Knowledge Sharing Mechanism
As with most blue-collar workers, new coming workers learned most skills during the
apprenticeship. The new comer would work with the experienced master who was in
the same organization for some time and after that he needed to work alone. The diag‐
nostic process and competence of maintenance was experience-guided [15]. With
limited experience, new comers spent more time to complete the task and sometimes
called others for help when they worked alone. Two expertise groups had diﬀerent atti‐
tudes in knowledge sharing. New comers mentioned following words about asking for
help:
I prefer to solve problems myself, which made me proud of myself. If I can not solve problems,
I will call experienced peers for help ﬁrst and then the senior workers because I do not want to
loose my face in front of the master. (30, 2-year experience)
New comers preferred to solve problems alone but they do not have much choice to
learn from each other. Phone calls or instant message (like We-Chat) were main ways
for experience exchanging. For experienced maintenance workers, they felt pleased to
help others. However, the experience sharing process was a disturbance to the experi‐
enced workers’ work. One participant expressed his experience in helping others:
I usually answer workers’ phone calls. Just yesterday, a young worker called me for help. After
his description, I told him the solution immediately. And after solving it, he called back again
to praise me and thank to me, but I do not have much time to talk to him. I was working as well.
(47, 25-year experience)
The ability to help others is the reﬂection of one’s knowledge and workers are proud
of their skills. Even the experienced workers would also ask workers who is senior to
them for help.
I have been in maintenance industry for more than 20 years and I still need to ask the senior
workers who are older than me for help if I can not solve the problem. It is common in our
industry. (43, 23-year experience)
This dedicated that all the maintenance workers had the requirement for asking
questions and sharing experience to share. Current ways could only share knowledge
within a small scope and this process could not be recorded.

Discussion
During the interview, workers showed positive attitude toward the concept of smart
phone application which could manage maintenance knowledge. Young workers
advised “the application should help learn some experience” (28, 1 year-experience).
Also, experienced workers suggested that “workers could share experience on the appli‐
cation and search for certain question on it” (49, 29 year-experience). Therefore, the
experience sharing application should take advantage of the CQA system to manage
workers experience and provide context-aware assistance to workers. Workers could
ask questions, share experience and search for problems on this application.
Potential use cases are generated from the knowledge sharing problems faced by
maintenance workers. The use cases can be categorized into four kinds: (1) search and
ask question; (2) remote assistance by answering other questions or sharing experience;
(3) capture experience by others’ sharing; (4) connect intra-organizational wide workers.
In this way workers could try to solve problems by themselves with this mobile database.
The application could reduce experienced workers’ workload to answer same questions
over and over again, and provide new comers good learning opportunities. New comers
could capture the experience besides on-site working with the mentor. What’s more,
this platform could connect the intra-organizational maintenance workers. The design
guidelines on the design of maintenance knowledge management application are
summarized in the Table 1.

The experience sharing application is to design to manage organizational wide
knowledge, so the norm of the industry or company must be considered during the
application design. Current training mechanism (i.e., newcomers learn skills by
following the master) of maintenance workers cultivates their willingness to share their
knowledge. Then this norm will inﬂuence users’ behavior in online community [12].
Moving experience sharing process to the smart phone application not only improves
the eﬃciency but also guarantees workers’ job safety by avoiding disturbances.

Moreover, the usage of technology needs to support the pre-existing behavior of the
users [10]. The nomadic nature of maintenance work makes social applications a neces‐
sary tool during the work, so the smart phone application used under experience-sharing
context would be useful. The application could connect the geographically dispersed
maintenance workers, but diﬀerent from instant message, this application aims to
exchange professional knowledge and all the records would be well stored and easily
retrieved.

Conclusion
This study explores the design of experience sharing application for elevator mainte‐
nance workers. Results indicate that the application should take advantage of the CQA
system and the potential use cases include “Search”, “Support”, “Connect” and
“Discover”.
Besides, the current training mechanism and nomadic property of the maintenance
are found contribute to the application usage. Further studies can be done to design the
interface and detailed functions of the experience sharing application and test the
usability of the application.

Abstract. Smartphone overuse is a growing social concern especially for
adolescents and young adults. There has been attempts to mitigate smartphone
overuse, however these trials mainly focused on curtailing usage time, disre-
garding users’ various usage contexts. The objective of this research is to proﬁle
smartphone users by understanding their needs and goals of smartphone usages
to suggest personalized guidelines to help develop healthy smartphone usage
habits. Focus- group interviews were conducted on twenty (13 male, 7 female,
M = 28.4, SD = 2.7) young adults. Five smartphone usage behavior indexes
conveying users’ needs and motivations (communication, entertainment, func-
tional tool, information search, and life logging) were used as criteria for pro-
ﬁling user groups. As a result, three groups (Social Fun Seeking, Leisure
Activity Seeking, and Information Seeking) were classiﬁed. Problematic
smartphone usage behaviors for each group are deﬁned and preventive guide-
lines for healthy smartphone usage are suggested.

Introduction
Smartphone, which is deﬁned as handheld personal computer, is one of distinguishing
evolutions of portable information and communication technologies [1]. Diffusion of
smartphones in the US was 25 % and 14 % worldwide in 2009 [2]. According to
“U. S. Smartphone Use in 2015” by Pew Research Center, 64 % of American adults
own a smartphone and this phenomenon is especially high among young adults [3].
Another report shows that smartphone penetration was nearly 90 % in age between
18–34 in the U.S. [4]. Smartphone ownership has rapidly diffused in South Korea.
Smart media penetration rate in Korea had increased from 31.3 % in 2011 to 78.6 % in
2014 [5]. According to Pew Research report in 2016, smartphone ownership rate in
South Korea was 88 % in 2015, which was the highest among 40 countries [6]. In
particular, the ownership rate was 100 % in the age between 18 and 34 [6]. Therefore,
high rate of smartphone diffusion in adolescents and young adults created various
social concerns in South Korea.

Deﬁning characteristics of smartphone is that it is a portable device, which allows
persistent network connectivity and installation of various applications. It allows users
to surf the Internet, watch videos, take pictures, and listen to music in addition to
making phone calls and sending text messages. Because of these diverse functions,
smartphones have the potential to produce various usage patterns among different users
[1]. Due to these characteristics, many people rely on smartphones for various activ-
ities, thus smartphone overuse became a growing social concern especially for ado-
lescents and young adults [1]. According to some researchers, possible problematic
consequences of smartphone overuse include individual mental and physical health
issues and social conﬂicts. Dried eyes, sleep pattern disturbance, carpal tunnel [7],
musculoskeletal symptoms [8, 9] and forward head posture [10] are some typical
symptoms due to smartphone overuse. Furthermore, one of distinguishing social
problems caused by smartphone overuse is creation of interpersonal conﬂicts when it
becomes a barrier to face-to-face interactions [11].
In order to determine smartphone addiction, Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale
(SAPS) was developed in South Korea to diagnose smartphone addiction levels. This
scale is composed of four subdomains (disturbance of adaptive functions, virtual life
orientation, withdrawal, and tolerance) [12]. However, since this questionnaire was
developed based on scales that were used to diagnose Internet and mobile phone
addiction before diffusion of smartphones, the scale may not completely reﬂect smart-
phone usage phenomenon nor include speciﬁc smartphone usage patterns. Another
Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (SAPS), Kwon et al. developed the Smartphone
Addiction Scale (SAS) in 2013 [13]. The scale is composed of six main factors
(daily-life disturbance, positive anticipation, withdrawal, cyberspace-oriented relation-
ship, overuse, and tolerance). Furthermore, they made a shorter version of SAS for
young children with ten questions from the original scale [12]. Some of shortcomings of
these scales are that they evaluate users’ addiction levels with uniform criteria which is
composed of questions about usage time and phenomenological index of smartphone
overuse. This does not concern psychological mechanism of smartphone overuse which
include users’ diverse needs and motivations. National Information Society Agency
(NIA) in South Korea developed a ‘Smart Media Addiction Prediction Index’ which is
consisted of questions about smart media burden index (usage time, used contents, user
motivations) and smart media risk factors (social and psychological factors such as
anxiety, loneliness, impulsivity and family interaction). This was a meaningful attempt
that includes questions about individual risk factors and social context related to media
addiction to subdivide the user groups and identify the subjects of smart media addiction
prevention [14]. However, they did not concern how these different factors contribute to
make a complex behavior patterns of individual users and how the user groups are
subdivided by their usage characteristics. The limitation of this approach is that instead
of considering diverse patterns of user groups and inventing personalized intervention
strategies, they only identiﬁed the levels of severity in addiction level such as general
group, potential risk group and high-risk group.
There have been several attempts to help those who are diagnosed as high-risk
group of smartphone addiction. Although the media reports that rate of high-risk
group is constantly increasing, it is still about 10 % of the entire smartphone user
population [15]. Rather than trying to reduce the level of excessive user rate of
Discovery of Smartphone User Group Proﬁling
427

smartphone use on those who are already diagnosed as high-risk group, preventive
intervention strategies should be available for broader user population to reduce overall
problematic smartphone use. Such preventive attempts include educational programs in
schools [15–17] and smartphone applications [18–21] that help people manage their
smartphone usage times. Most of these applications record and show the names of
smartphone applications that were used, and time spent on using those applications.
Furthermore, some applications deny access of smartphones for certain period of time
when ones usage time exceed the preset time limits. However, these applications does
not consider individual user’s complex usage contexts when providing preventive
interventions. For preventive interventions of smartphone overuse to be more effective,
instead of focusing on reducing absolute usage time, incorporating various usage
patterns, needs, and motivations of users are necessary. Based on these interpretations,
it is possible to construct personalized prevention strategies for different user groups.

Research Method
This study was designed to obtain qualitative feedbacks from users’ smartphone usage
patterns and motivations. The primary goal was to categorize distinctive user groups
based on smartphone usage motivations and behaviors then characteristics for each user
proﬁle.
2.1
Study Design
We have conducted focus group interview to gather qualitative research data collection.
Prior to the interviews, participants conducted an online questionnaire that examined
levels of smart phone addiction using SAPS [12]. Questionnaire results were used as
reference to evenly distribute participants with varying smartphone addiction levels
into groups. One moderator led the interview sessions while the other researcher
transcribed conversations, and the entire process took about 90 min. Each participant
was rewarded with about US$15 gift certiﬁcate.
2.2
Participants
Possibly excessive use of the Internet or smartphone is more prevalent among university
students, because often, they are highly Internet literate and use smartphones for many
purposes; they have ﬂexible schedules with little external control over their Internet or
smartphone use [22]. A total of twenty university students (13 male, 7 female; average
age = 28.4, SD = 2.7) participated in the focus group interviews. Five sessions of focus
group interview consisting of four mixed gender participants were conducted. All
participants were graduate school students of various majors including industrial design,
computer science, psychology, biology and others. All the participants used computers
and smartphones almost every day and owned their own smartphones. They rated their
skill of using computers and smartphones as advanced.

Interview Questions
Researchers deﬁned ﬁve smartphone usage behavior indexes (communication, enter-
tainment, functional tool, information search, and life-logging) based on most dis-
tinctive smartphone usage activities as criteria for semi-structured interview. Interview
session consisted of questions that seek users’ general smartphone usage behavior
related information (e.g., How long have you used smartphone? Which function do you
consider as the most important when purchasing a smartphone?), communication
activities (e.g., What kind of communication activities do you do with smartphone?
How often and how long do you use smartphone for communication activities?),
entertainment activities (e.g., What kind of entertainment activities do you do with
smartphone? How often and how long do you use smartphone for entertainment
activities?), functional tool usages (e.g., What kind of functional tools do you use with
smart phone? How often and how long do you use a smartphone for functional tools?),
information search activities (e.g., What kind of information search activities do you do
with smartphone? How often and how long do you use a smartphone for information
search activities?), and life-logging related activities (e.g., What kind of life-logging
activities do you do with smartphone? How often and how long do you use smartphone
for life-logging activities?). After discussing these questions above, each participant
was asked to rank the ﬁve usage behavior indexes that he or she most frequently used,
and then rank them in the order of personal importance.

Results
Three researchers analyzed self-reported answers from participants to gain further
insight of how participants use such functions and perceive them using afﬁnity diagram
method. This method is effective in organizing large amount of qualitative data into
sub-groups with similarities [23].
3.1

Table 1. Smartphone usage behavior index: communication
Descriptions
Main activities
KakaoTalk [24], SNS (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), Blogs,
Telephone, Text, Messenger, LinkedIn [25]
Reasons for usage
Because many people including family members and close friends
use communication applications; The characteristics of digital
media allows convenient and frequent communication
Usefulness
Allows quick, convenient, and economical communication
Potential consequences
of overuse
Frequent notiﬁcation checks (from SNS, applications etc.) reduce
concentration level and inhibit workﬂow, and overuse may lead
to unintentional time consumption. Furthermore, ease of
communication tends to result in frequent usages and people
sometimes feel pressure to promptly reply to the others. This
may lead to reduction of frequency of face-to-face
communication
Findings
Communication is most frequently used function and many users
have experienced unintentional overuse at certain points of
smartphone usage
Table 2. Smartphone usage behavior index: entertainment
Descriptions
Main activities
Games, movies, TV, music, web-cartoon, e-book, shopping, web
surﬁng, internet radio, user created contents (e.g., taking
pictures, videos, producing music, drawing)
Reasons for usage
Provides convenient usage with less constraints in time, space and
money for fun (e.g., killing time, use while commuting)
Usefulness
Fun, accomplishment, immersion, effective use of spare time, able
to share links with friends, reduces stress and sense of loneliness
Potential consequences
of overuse
Participants often spend more time on entertainment related
functions than intended. Sometimes unnecessary monetary
spending occurs due to immersion in certain contents such as
mobile social games. Long hours of smartphone usage may
cause health problems such as sleep disturbance, sore eyes,
wrist-ache, and backache
Findings
Using entertainment related activities more than intended was core
problem for many users

Usefulness
Do not have to carry many different devices because smartphone
integrates many functional devices
Potential consequences
of overuse
Using Functional Tool related functions itself is not threat for over
usage nor have severe negative impacts
Findings
Since Functional Tool related functions are practical or productive,
using such functions are not perceived as problematic in general.
However, results from Functional Tool use can be lead into
other smartphone activities with potential of overuse (e.g., after
taking pictures and then uploading them into SNS)
Table 4. Smartphone usage behavior index: information search
Descriptions
Main activities
Search daily information (e.g., path ﬁnding, job search, weather),
web surﬁng (e.g., information, news, shopping information,
scholar, dictionary), make reservations etc.
Reasons for usage
Characteristics of smartphone allow quick and easy search with
minimal constraints in time, space and money
Usefulness
Searching for daily information including weather, bus time,
directions and so on are convenient
Potential consequences
of overuse
Information Search Function itself is practical, yet when spending
too much time searching unrelated issues or when searching
certain information leads into other unexpected activities may
become problematic. Due to frequent searching, thinking
process can be simpliﬁed or users may over rely on the
searching devices
Findings
Many people use smartphones for simple information search in
daily bases. Sometimes, when using portal sites, searching
activities unintentionally leads to entertainment related activities
Table 5. Smartphone usage behavior index: life-logging
Descriptions
Main activities
Taking pictures/videos, memo (e.g., ideas, gas ledger, household
ledger, grocery-list), SNS (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Facebook),
health related recording (e.g., wearable devices, work out
logging, sleeping cycle, menstrual phase calendar)
Reasons for usage
To check one’s daily life cycles; To quickly record speciﬁc
information (e.g., car repair record)
Usefulness
Digitalized logging information clearly shows accumulated data;
Using smartphone allows easy sharing, automatic location
recording, and convenient data logging using specialized
applications

Smartphone User Group Proﬁling
Participants (two participants who did not show signiﬁcant patterns were excluded)
were categorized into three Smartphone User Groups (Social Fun Seeking Group,
Leisure Activity Seeking Group, Information Seeking Group) from self-reported
smartphone usage patterns based on the answers from the focus group interview ses-
sions. General descriptions and characteristics of each group are described below. The
solid line is the average rank of frequency of each behavior index, and the dotted line is
the average rank of evaluated importance of each behavior index in Fig. 1.
Social Fun Seeking Group. Six participants were categorized into Social Fun Seeking
Group. Figure 1 shows general pattern of smartphone usage behavior of this
group. Relative usage frequency of communication appeared to be the highest, and
users in this group tended to use communication functions more than they considered it
to be important. One of favored forms of communication activities for this group is
talking with friends over social casual games, which also leads into conversations on
SNS and communicative applications on the smartphone.
Leisure Activity Seeking Group. Seven participants were categorized into Leisure
Activity Seeking Group. Figure 1 shows general pattern of smartphone usage behavior
of this group. Relative usage time of entertainment function appeared to be the highest,
yet users in this group tended to use entertainment functions more than they considered
it to be important. Prominently used forms of entertainment activities are game, radio
and YouTube. Participants in this group preferred to enjoy leisurely activities using
smartphones by themselves to reduce stress.
Information Seeking Group. Five participants were categorized into Information
Seeking Group. Figure 1 shows general pattern of smartphone usage behavior of this
group. Relative usage frequency of information searching appeared to be the highest
and participants in this group considered information searching to be most important.
Search engines are frequently accessed for information searching. Participants searched
simple information such as path ﬁnding, spell checks, timetable for transportation, and
hobby related information using a smartphone. Participants in this group did not
frequently use nor considered entertainment function to be important (Table 6).
Table 5. (Continued)
Descriptions
Potential consequences
of overuse
Using smartphone applications for life-logging purpose itself is
not perceived as a serious threat for over usage. However,
excessively logging data without clear purposes can be a waste
of time and cellular data
Findings
Smartphone allows quick and convenient life-logging. Using such
function itself hardly leads to prolonged smartphone usage.
However, results from life-logging can lead to other smartphone
activities with potential of overuse (e.g., recording exercise logs
and then uploading them into SNS)

Discussion
This paper presented categorization of smartphone user groups based on users’
smartphone usage behaviors and motivations to gain further insights of speciﬁc user
groups. Figure 1 shows comparisons of distinctive features of three smartphone user
groups (Social Fun Seeking Group, Leisure Activity Seeking Group and Information
Seeking Group). Discrepancies between actual usage frequency and considered
importance can be observed. It can be inferred that different smartphone users have
varying motivations and goals for smartphone usages with different smartphone usage
patterns. This indicates that considering smartphone usage time without regarding
usage contexts to determine smartphone overuse could be misleading. Ultimately, the
ﬁndings of this study can be the starting point for further research on excessive
problematic smartphone use prevention by providing practical recommendations for
differing user groups. Despite exploring speciﬁc user motivations and usage behaviors
or speciﬁc smartphone index and then proﬁle different smartphone user groups with

distinctive characteristics, some limitations should be noted. First, only South Korean
students participated in this study. Therefore the study ﬁnding may not be generalized
to other cultural, age, or education-level groups. Second, this study was conducted in
the form of self-report assessment. Therefore discrepancies between participants’ actual
and perceived smartphone usage behavior may exist. Third, the questionnaires covered
participants’ smartphone usage behaviors without speciﬁc duration nor particular
contexts. In the future, more speciﬁc user contexts should be deﬁned to gain under-
standings to form more robust user groups. Furthermore, based on user group’s
characteristics, differing mediation guidelines that are more speciﬁc to the user proﬁle
can be applied to form sustainable healthy smartphone usage habits. In the future,
smartphone usage log data and comprehensive usage contexts should be integrated into
software for more accurate and objective user proﬁling for instantaneous feedbacks to
the users for more effective smartphone usage habit formation.
5
Conclusion
The ﬁnding of this study show that smartphone users have different intentions for
smartphone usage with distinctive smartphone usage patterns. This point to the fact that
when applying intervention strategies to prevent excessive smartphone uses, a single
intervention method is not sufﬁcient enough to help modify smartphone usage patterns.
The ﬁndings therefore provide support to the core ideas that to help form sustainable
healthy smartphone usage habits, different intervention strategies should be applied to
different smartphone user group by considering speciﬁc usage motivations and
behaviors. With the growing prevalence of concerns for problematic smartphone usage,
it is imperative that more research on this topic is conducted. Furthermore, prevention
techniques that are more speciﬁc to the user should be considered by institutions such
as schools or universities to establish broader prevention.

Abstract. Wearable technology has been enjoying a growth of market since it
ﬁrst caught attention of the public in 2010. More than 400 wearable devices
have been developed and 60 % of them are activity trackers. China has a great
market potential for wearable devices due to the high acceptance of wearable
technology in Chinese users. It is important and necessary for designers to
understand the speciﬁc user requirements and preferences of wearable devices
for activity tracking and specify the different preferences among China and other
countries. In this study, we collected both qualitative and quantitative user
requirements of Chinese and Germans then compared the result to elicit practical
design instructions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted ﬁrstly on ten
Germans and ten Chinese to obtain qualitative requirements. A quantitative
questionnaire was designed based on the ﬁndings of the interviews and a total of
158 respondents participated the survey (52 from Germany, 97 from China and
9
from
other
countries).
Descriptive
statistics
were

and
non-parametric tests were used to compare the requirements between Chinese
users and German users.

Introduction
Wearable technology has been enjoying a growth of market since it ﬁrst caught
attention of the public in 2010. It was estimated that the Compound Annual Growth
Rate would vary between 24.56 % [1] up to as high as 154 % [2] from 2013 until 2017,
which would increase the market size to up to $50 billion in 2018 [3].
Wearable devices referred to electronic devices attached and/or embedded in
clothes and accessories, which could be worn comfortably on the body [4]. As deﬁned
by [5], three distinct characteristics should be included in wearable devices: (1) they
integrate seamlessly with the user’s ﬁt; (2) they allow for sensory input; and (3) they

are connected with other devices. More than 400 wearable devices have been devel-
oped by worldwide corporations as well as startups [6], among which 193 devices are
capable for ﬁtness use and 253 devices are related with lifestyle. These activity trackers
were proven to be the most successful among all the wearable devices and accounted
for over 60 % of all wearables on the market [5, 7].
Though few studies addressed user requirements for activity trackers, studies
revealed how users accepted mobile/wearable technologies. A series of four studies in
University of Illinois revealed that (1) there was a strong inﬂuence of the perceived
maturity of a technology on the adaption. At the same time, the familiarity of the tech-
nology impacted the user perceived ease of use [8]; (2) functionality, portability, per-
formance, usability and network were ﬁve important features during design of wearable
devices [9]; (3) the mobility of a mobile technology was not necessarily geographical
moveable but the devices should “roam freely” among different user scenarios [9].
Speciﬁcally, preliminary experimental studies pointed out several requirements of
wearable devices. In [10], 26 participants used wearable devices in their daily life and
indicated two key concerns: (1) data capture and analysis of current technology need to
be improved; and (2) privacy problems should be carefully handled. Privacy concerns
were also discovered in [11, 12]. “Persistent identity” which meant to identify the
identity of a speciﬁc user was appealing to users [2, 13]. Other key characteristics of
wearable devices included data accuracy, appealing design, ease of use and indepen-
dency from smartphone. Furthermore, sensor analytics and mobile payments were two
promising applications for wearable devices [2].
It is believed that China would become a great market potential for wearable devices
with a growth from 420 million to 1 billion in 2015 [14]. Chinese might contribute a
signiﬁcant higher share than western countries based on the results of an online survey
with 24,000 respondents in 2014 [15]. Cultural differences between Chinese users and
the worldwide designers [16] might challenge the adoption of the designed wearable
devices (specially, the activity trackers). It is important and necessary for designers to
understand the speciﬁc user requirements and preferences of wearable devices of
activity tracking and specify the different preferences among China and other countries.
Aimed at ﬁguring out the speciﬁc requirements of wearable devices for activity
tracking of Chinese users and comparing the ﬁndings with those of western countries
(German as a representative), preliminary interviews and semi-structured interviews
were conducted to collect qualitative requirements. A quantitative questionnaire was
designed based on the ﬁndings and a total of 158 respondents participated the survey
(52 from Germany, 97 from China and 9 from other countries) answered the
39-question survey. Descriptive statistics were summarized and non-parametric tests
were used to compare the requirements between Chinese users and German users.

Method
2.1
Qualitative Interviews and Findings
The ﬁrst step of the study were qualitative requirements elicitation interviews. Five
preliminary interviews were conducted to understand attitudes towards using wearable

devices for activity tracking. Then semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten
German and ten Chinese participants to collect information for questionnaire design.
The interview consisted of six sections: (1) “previous experience with wearable
devices”; (2) “functional requirements”; (3) “physical appearance”; (4) “battery”;
(5) “robustness”; and (6) “data”.
The main ﬁndings of qualitative requirement elicitation were summarized below.
These functions and attributes were used to design the user survey questionnaire.
• A long battery life (mentioned by all the 20 participants) was expected though not
exact duration could be concluded.
• The preferred location of wearing the devices were head and wrist.
• Users thought the interaction between the wearables and other devices were
important and all of the interviewees agreed the connection to smartphones.
• Upload activity data to social network caught interests of the respondents and they
expected to gain motivation from the activity share.
• The privacy and data security should be guaranteed, especially for the German
users (7 out of 10 mentioned the concern).
• Every participant described desired appearance of a wearable activity tracker.
Frequently mentioned styles included: (1) a conventional watch; (2) jewelry;
(3) designs that were outstanding/technical/futuristic; (4) simple design.
• More than two third participants expected a waterproof wearable device.
• The functions of a wearable devices for activity tracking should include step count,
GPS tracking, sleep monitoring, calories burned, cellphone handling capability,
conventional watch functionality, and biodata monitoring.
2.2
Requirements Elicitation Survey
The user requirement elicitation surveys were designed based on the results of the
interviews. The questionnaire was made up by three sections. The ﬁrst (1) section was
“the participant’s personal information”. This section comprised the participant’s age,
their nationality and the familiarity of the user with wearable devices. The second
(2) section was “general preferences for wearable devices for activity tracking”. In this
section, we asked the preferred location of the wearable device, preferred method to
unlock the wearable device and preferred appearance of the wearable device. For these
three categories, participants could check as many options as they thought appropriate.
Multiple choices questions collected the expected battery lifetime, data display, inde-
pendence of the device and the extent connected to social networks. Then seven items
regarding the characteristics of wearable activity trackers were rated using 7-point scale
(“1: very important” to “7: not important”). The last section (3) contained 21 functions
collected from market research and interview results. Using a 7-point scale, participants
rated their perceived usefulness of the functions (“1: Must have” to “7: useless”).
The questionnaire was designed in English to avoid misunderstanding caused by
interpretation. Online questionnaires were distributed on campus of Tsinghua University.

Results
3.1
Participants
The questionnaire was answered by 158 respondents (Male = 93, Female = 65), in
which 52 were Germany, 97 were Chinese and 9 were from other countries. The age
distribution is listed in Table 1. Regarding the previous experience of using wearable
devices, up to 54.43 % (86 respondents) did not use wearable devices, 22.78 % (36
respondents) wore the devices sometimes, 7.59 % (12 respondents) wore the devices
more than three days a week, 8.86 % (14 respondents) used the devices every daytime
and the remaining 6.32 % always wore a wearable device.
3.2
Location of Wearing the Devices
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the “wrist” was chosen as preferred location by more than 40 %
(43.67 %) respondents, regardless of the culture background of the users. The second
and third preferred locations were “arms” and “ﬁngers”, chosen by 37.34 % and
29.11 % participants, respectively. “Chest”, “torso”, “legs” and “feet” were only pre-
ferred by around 15 % or less respondents, which suggested the designers to avoid
these positions.
Comparing the preference between Germans and Chinese, we found that although
“ﬁngers” seemed to be a good position, the percentage of Chinese who preferred
“ﬁngers” was as twice as that of Germans. Another position that Chinese respondents
liked more was “waist”, but we thought this difference was caused by the misread on
the word “waist” as “wrist”. Positions that Germans preferred more than Chinese were
“feet”, “torso”, and “chest”, but they were not popular choices for all the participants.
3.3
Unlock Mechanism
As shown in Fig. 2, unlock the wearable devices by ﬁngerprint was the most popular
choice (overall percentage 58.23 %). PIN was preferred by nearly 40 % (39.87 %)
respondents, which came as the second popular unlock mechanism. An interesting
point to notice was that ﬁngerprint was preferred by 65.98 % Chinese while only
46.15 % Germans checked this mechanism. Inverse result occurred in PIN, 55.77 %

Germans chose this option while only 31.96 % Chinese checked the item. We inferred
that there was a difference in the preferred unlock mechanism between Chinese and
Germans, and suggested unlock by ﬁngerprint for Chinese and by PIN for the Germans.
3.4
Appearance
The top 2 chosen design styles for the wearable devices were “simple design”
(60.13 %) and “as a conventional watch” (47.47 %) (See Fig. 3). But “simple design”
was much more popular in German users than in Chinese users with a great gap
between the percentages (German: 75.00 %, Chinese: 51.55 %). This difference was
consistent with the ﬁnding that Chinese users enjoyed “outstanding (20.62 %)” and
“futuristic (28.87 %)” appearance more, compared with a relatively low preference on
these two styles in German users (“outstanding”: 5.77 %, “futuristic”: 17.31 %). We
inferred that although simple design was preferred by most users, the designers also
need to integrate outstanding and futuristic features to the devices for the Chinese users.
3.5
Battery Lifetime
The distribution of expected minimal battery lifetime had two peaks (See Fig. 4). More
than half participants stated their minimal battery lifetime to be either 1 or 3 days. Due
to a relative high selection frequency on the duration “1 week”, we would suggest a
Fig. 1. Preferred location of wearing the devices
Fig. 2. Preferred unlock mechanism for the devices

1-day to 7-day battery lifetime. There was little inﬂuence of the culture on the preferred
battery lifetime.
3.6
Display
The answer of whether to include a display was demonstrated in Fig. 5. No signiﬁcant
difference was recognized between the Chinese and German respondents. Because
more than half respondents (52.53 %) chose to have a display in their wearable devices
for activity tracking, we suggested that the device for activity tracking should have a
display.

3.7
Dependency on Other Devices
More than 60 % (60.76 %) participants thought their devices should be partially
dependent on their smartphones, and cultural difference did not inﬂuence the results
much (See Fig. 6).
3.8
Share Data on SNS
Cultural difference had a great inﬂuence on the opinion to share data to SNS (See
Fig. 7). Most Germans (69.23 %) stated that they would not share the information on
SNS (69.23 %). However, Chinese preferred to share the data (37.11 %) or held a
neutral opinion (48.15 %) on whether to share the data to SNS.
3.9
Attributes and Features
In Table 2, we listed the importance scores for seven design features of wearable
devices for activity tracking. The mean scores for each item were shown with standard
deviations given in blankets. All the listed features got a mean score of less than 3
points, indicating that all the features were important. Mann-Whitney independent test
was used to determine whether the answers of the Chinese and Germans had statisti-
cally signiﬁcant differences. The bolded score meant signiﬁcantly more important
(signiﬁcantly lower score). “Good appearance” and “Easy to put on and off” were
regarded more important for the Chinese while “Physical robustness” was rated more
important for the Germans.

3.10
Functions
In Table 3, we listed the mean score and standard deviation (in blankets) for 21
functions. A less than 3.5 point meant that the function was useful. From a comparison
of the ratings using Mann-Whitney test, we concluded that the preferences varied
between Chinese and Germans. The signiﬁcantly more useful (lower score) were
bolded.
Useful functions selected by both cultures were: GPS tracking, alarm clock,
intelligent alarm, sleep monitoring, calories burned, watch, blood pressure measure-
ment, ﬁnd the device, charging by induction, and inform the incoming call.
Some functions were thought as useful only by the Chinese: mobile payment,
wireless key, step count, activity identiﬁcation, and temperature measurement, moni-
toring audio data, illness detection, calendar, voice control, and display test message.
Mann-Whitney test results showed that except for the “monitoring audio” function, all the
differences between the Chinese and Germans were signiﬁcant at 95 conﬁdence level.

Discussion
Among all the features and functions rated in the questionnaire, we found the biggest
difference between Germans and Chinese was on whether to share the activity data to
the social networks. Chinese users supported the opinion to share data to SNS while
most Germans denied this idea. The different preference regarding the connection to
social networks was also reﬂected in the results of the semi-structured interviews.
This difference could be partially explained by the different use patterns of social
networking services [17]. Chinese had a share of 61.6 % of mobile users amongst the
users of social networking services [18]. A survey in Germany on the other hand
revealed that in 2013 only 18 % of German participants regularly used their mobile
devices to access social network services [19]. The difference in behavior did also
manifest in the spread of different types of social networking services in China and
Germany. In 2014 Facebook had a market share of 71 % in Germany [20], while the
social networking services in China did focus more on mobile use, as for example
WeChat, which was used by 73 % of the Chinese online population [21].
Another noticeable item was “mobile payment”. It was rated second highest
(second important) by German participants (4.71, not important) as well as Chinese
(3.38, a bit important) with an average rating for all participants of 3.86 (not important).
The result was not in conformity to previous surveys [2] which stated that mobile
payment was one of the “killer features” of wearable technology. One of the causes was
a perceived security risk of mobile payment from the users. Consumers were also
concerned about the device and the network reliability. Furthermore, users feared of too
complex data input formats, codes and service numbers, complex registration proce-
dures, and management of separate accounts [22].
The above ﬁndings suggested that wearable devices designed for Chinese should
include the data sharing function but had to exclude this function when designed for
Germans. Security of data privacy and simpliﬁcation of payment procedure need to be
carefully considered and guaranteed.
There were limitations to the results of this paper. Firstly, only 158 participants
took part in the survey and they were mainly college students recruited on the campus
of Tsinghua University. The college students did not represent the potential users of
wearable devices. Secondly, the survey and the interviews were conducted in English
to minimize the translation errors of responses but none of the participants was a native
English speaker. This might negatively affect the results due to the misunderstanding of
the questions. Lastly, cultural differences in response style might lead to a bias of the
results. A more extreme response style (ERS) of the Germans and a more acquiescence
response style (ARS) by the Chinese might inﬂuence the comparison of the answers
between two countries.

Conclusion
In this paper, we collected the user requirements of wearable devices for activity tracking
and compared the results between Germans and Chinese to address the inﬂuence of
cultural difference. The requirements and differences on user requirements would guide

the development of wearable devices for activity tracking. The different preferences
between Chinese respondents and Germany respondents suggested the designers to
include different functions and features in wearable devices for activity tracking.

Abstract. This study explores how to use a mobile service to improve tourists’
experiences when visiting Herbal Lane’s business district in Taipei. In Taiwan,
mobile broadband Internet access is very popular, and it can thus support mobile
applications to provide visitors with better tourism experiences. We approached
the research by conducting a design project. This study developed a mobile appli‐
cation by integrating professional ﬁelds including design, information
engineering, and traditional Chinese medicine. This study delivered a workable
prototype—a mobile application for visiting Herbal Lane. With the workable
prototype, we further carried out a user-testing study to understand whether the
mobile application can improve visitors’ experience in Herbal Lane district. A
total of 114 visitors (61 male and 53 female) were recruited to participate in the
user-testing study. The results indicated that the mobile application could improve
visitors’ tourism experiences more than those without the mobile application. The
mobile application signiﬁcantly enhanced the visitors’ tourism experience on the
four dimensions: enjoyment, novelty, local culture, and involvement. The ﬁnd‐
ings and implications are further discussed in this paper.

Introduction
This study explores how to use a mobile service to improve visitors’ tourism experience
when visiting Herbal Lane’s business district in Taipei. Herbal Lane, which is the largest
business cluster of herbal business in northern Taiwan, is one of the many regions in
Taipei that is worth marketing and promoting (see Fig. 1). This is because its long history
of herbal culture makes it a very unique tourist attraction in Taipei. Herbal Lane is an
ancient street that has experienced urban periphery problems, but owing to the changing
population and urban development over time, it has gradually transformed into a tourist
attraction for health, wellbeing, and cultural tours. The buying and selling activities in
Herbal Lane are rare and novel for visitors and thus easily attract people’s attention. In
order to develop the tourism resources of Herbal Lane, the city’s municipalities have
displayed wooden plaques at each intersection. However, despite these attracting some
visitors to the area, the visitors often fail to understand the special characteristics of the

herbal industry. Reforming the street and the region can promote Herbal Lane to make
it well-known, but it cannot expand the market or attract younger generations to continue
the culture of the herbal industry. While the government is focusing in promoting the
Herbal Lane business district, it is limited to using traditional forms of landscape trans‐
formation, without considering the herbal industry and its unique culture of herbal health
and wellbeing. This means that visitors are unable to develop an understanding of the
long and profound herbal culture, and new customers cannot be developed in order to
continue the culture of the industry.

In recent years, business owners in the Herbal Lane business district have tried to
use digital marketing to develop the market and attract new customers. Some shops have
already carried out promotional activities such as QR-code scanning or Facebook check-
in, indicating that business owners in Herbal Lane are actively seeking new media
exposure and promotional methods to gain acceptance of the herbal industry from a
larger population. While the business district is a component of a city, the development
of a city’s business district is closely related to urban prosperity, and thus district trans‐
formation is an import part of urban promotion. Kotler et al. [1] proposed the concept
of place marketing and regarded a region as a corporate body. Driven by market demand
and by combining the local advantages and characteristics, the region can be actively
developed into an attractive product to promote the development of the local economy,
tourism, and investment. As a result, when promoting a business district, the diﬀerent
characteristics will often require diﬀerent strategies for promotion [2].
Mobile service can be used to strengthen the business district and tourism industry.
In Taiwan, mobile broadband Internet access is very popular, and it can thus support
mobile applications to promote regions. This study attempts to promote regional
marketing by integrating designs with mobile service. Herbal Lane’s business district
is currently going through a transition to open the market to new customers. Therefore,
by incorporating new methods of design and mobile service, Herbal Lane’s business
district could provide consumers and visitors with a profound experience, thus
improving the image of the region. For this reason, our study uses Herbal Lane as the
research ﬁeld. We approach the research by conducting a real design project. Design is

an approach of inquiry and action used by humans to engage with the world. Cross [3]
coined the term “designerly ways of knowing” to highlight the uniqueness of design
knowledge, and he argued that part of design knowledge is inherent in the activity of
designing, gained by engaging in and reﬂecting on activities through the design process.
Thus, we carried out a design project by focusing on the design of a mobile service to
enhance the tourism experiences in Herbal Lane. The design outcomes created through
this study served as answers to the design inquiry and sources of design topics [4, 5].
Further, the design outcome was used as a workable prototype to conduct a ﬁeld study
to gain insight into the eﬀects of the design outcome on visitors’ experiences of Herbal
Lane.

Tourism Experience
Tourism experience forms the core of tourism activities and aﬀects visitors’ psycho‐
logical factors or travel behaviors during their journeys. People visit various places and
seek various entertainment and recreations because they are bored with their bland life‐
style and they wish to pursue something that they cannot usually grasp [6]. Otto and
Ritchie [7] concluded that people who travel possess a subjective state of mind based
on the following types of experiences. First, the external environment stimulates the
visitors’ senses. The visitor feels and interprets the information received based on their
individual knowledge and previous experiences. The information is integrated and
stored in their memories. The series of processes constitutes the tourism experience.
Therefore, tourism experience is a process. Even when the process ends, the feelings
that people experienced stay in their memories, and the souvenirs they purchased bring
them unforgettable memories. Ooi [8] proposed that the visitors’ backgrounds and
interests could aﬀect their tourism experiences. For example, two travelers doing the
same thing at the same location can have very diﬀerent travel experiences depending on
their feelings and emotions at a particular time. Kim et al. [9] proposed seven factors of
memorable tourism experiences (MTE): (a) hedonism, (b) meaningfulness, (c) involve‐
ment, (d) local culture, (e) knowledge, (f) novelty, and (h) refreshment. Sthapit [10] used
the MTE scale was to investigate the impact of each factor on visitors’ tourism experi‐
ences in Rovaniem city. The results showed that “local culture” and “novelty” have the
most signiﬁcant impacts on visitors’ tourism experiences. Research on tourism experi‐
ence has gradually changed from focusing on physical objects to studying visitors’
subjective perceptions [11]. Tourism service providers should comprehensively weigh
the proportion of each factor of memorable tourism experiences to better tourists’ expe‐
riences.

Mobile Applications
Nowadays, the constantly evolving information technology can allow visitors to a loca‐
tion to rapidly understand the area, and many suitable services and products have been
developed to meet consumer requirements [12]. After the rapid development in recent
years, mobile phones have become the most convenient mobile device, evolving from
450
F.-W. Tung and M. Wu

feature phones to the current mainstream smart phones with the expansion features for
third party programs. Because phones support the functional expansion of countless
mobile applications, mobile phones have become mobile service-providing centers.
Henseler et al. [13] stated that mobile services have become increasingly important
because of improved access to the Internet and the large amount of add-on functions on
newer models. People’s acceptance of mobile services has risen due to the popularity
of smart phones and the functions of the available applications.
Owing to this increased acceptance of smart phones, carrying out marketing
campaigns using the Internet and smart phones has become an eﬀective promotion
strategy. Shankar and Balasubramanian [14] stated that mobile marketing between the
business and the consumer could be regarded as using mobile media, equipment, or
technology to perform a wide range of interactions and promotions. The smart phone
can be used at anytime and anywhere, and its interactive function makes it easy for users
to rapidly share and spread their travel experiences through social network platforms.
With the mobile content, we can combine the visitors’ virtual experience with their real
experiences on site to eﬀectively promote and market the region and bring a diﬀerent
experience to the visitors. For example, because almost every attraction in London has
a long history and cultural background, an application called Street Museum was devel‐
oped, which enables visitors to see how the streets where they are standing looked in
the past. Another example is the Ubiquitous Art Tour in Tokyo, which oﬀers visitors
“Ubiquitous Communicators” to guide them to respective art works in Tokyo’s Midtown
area. As the visitors stand in front of each artwork, they can access information about
the art and the artists with images that introduce the creative process.
The functions of smart mobile devices are becoming more powerful. The involve‐
ment of information technology in marketing is no longer limited to providing a func‐
tional user interface. Using technology, we can establish an environment that combines
the real world with the virtual world, based on the existing service, and provide a valued
and innovative service. The concept of integrating O2O (Online to Oﬄine) has been
increasingly accepted by consumers. Using information technology, we can create inter‐
active experiences between the people and the location, which contributes to regional
marketing and promotions. This study uses Herbal Lane as the research ﬁeld. By imple‐
menting and verifying our design project, we explore how to develop a mobile appli‐
cation to market the business district and improve the travel experience of visitors.

Design Project
This study focuses on the business district in Herbal Lane and explores how to improve
visitors’ experience of the business district using a mobile application. We formed a
multidisciplinary team that consisted of design and computer science students who
collaborated with a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner on the approach
for this design project over nine months to develop a mobile application for Herbal Lane.

4.1
Problem Finding
First, we started with interviewing business owners in Herbal lane to understand the
development and challenges of Herbal Lane’s business district. We then observed the
visitors’ behaviors and interviewed the visitors to understand their travel experiences.
From the interviews and observations, we learned that the younger travelers are unfa‐
miliar with and lack interest in the herbs and their eﬃcacy despite the beneﬁts to their
health and wellbeing, which prevents them from enjoying their experiences in Herbal
Lane fully. We therefore aimed to design a solution that would trigger the visitors’
interest in the herbs in Herbal Lane. In order to achieve eﬀective marketing results, the
marketing content needed to be relevant to the consumers, containing compelling and
contextual factors that would entertain the consumers suﬃciently for them to share the
products with others.
4.2
Solution
Based on the problem we discovered above and to promote the business district in Herbal
Lane, we aimed to propose a solution that can establish connections with the visitors
and the Herbal Lane by providing them with a novel way to experience the Herbal Lane.
This study developed a mobile application to allow visitors to understand the properties
of herbs in Herbal Lane based on their individual needs, thereby motivating them to
explore Herbal Lane. This project developed a mobile application that can determine
user body constitution by asking him/her questions and was inspired by the ten questions
used for the TCM diagnosis from which a TCM practitioner learns about patient body
constitution. The mobile application then recommends a suitable herb to the user
according to the body constitution of the user. This creates connections between the
visitors and the herbs in Herbal Lane, and guides them to Herbal Lane to search the
recommended herbs. Icon tags are displayed on the herb containers so that visitors can
use the pattern recognition feature in their mobile phones to ensure they ﬁnd the correct
herb that was recommended to them, thereby allowing visitors ﬁnd the suitable herb for
their health and wellbeing. With the mobile application, the new tourism experience in
Herbal Lane is described below.
4.3
New Tourism Experience in Herbal Lane
Understanding Your Body Constitution. To build connections with the visitors and
spark their interest, we invited business owners from Herbal Lane and senior TCM
practitioners to participate in discussions and develop a database for “question-body
constitution -herb.” By asking a series of questions, the body constitution of the visitor
can be estimated and the suitable herb for the health and wellbeing of the visitor can be
recommended. Once they ﬁnish answering the questions, they are notiﬁed of their body
constitution and the recommended herbs.
Finding Your Herb. After answering the questions, the application recommends suit‐
able herbs to the visitors by displaying pictures and icons of the recommended herbs.
452
F.-W. Tung and M. Wu

The visitors are then invited to go to Herbal Lane to ﬁnd the herbs. The pictures or icons
of the herbs help visitors to ﬁnd the recommended herbs, and the icon on the herb
container can be scanned using the camera on the mobile phone to obtain information
about the herb. When the phone camera is held close to the tag of the herb, based on
pattern recognition, the application can automatically identify the type of the herb and
notify the visitors if they have found the correct herb (see Fig. 2).
Fig. 2. One kernel at xs (dotted kernel) or two kernels at xi and xj
Share Your Finding. When the visitor has found the correct herb, the system will
introduce the preparation method and eﬃcacy of the herb. Once the system has obtained
consent from the user, the herb information will be automatically uploaded to social
media platforms.
4.4
User-Testing Study
In order to understand whether the mobile application proposed in the study can improve
visitors’ experience when they go to Herbal Lane, we obtained permission from the
shops in Herbal Lane to perform a user-testing study. We recruited 114 visitors (61 male
and 53 female) to participate in the study. The participants, aged between 20 and 35,
were divided into two groups randomly; 55 participants used the application while the
other 59 did not use the application. The application could be downloaded via the QR
code on the site. The two groups were similar in sex distribution and age. Once the
participants had completed their tour of Herbal Lane, we asked them to ﬁll out a ques‐
tionnaire. The participants were thanked and oﬀered a gift certiﬁcate worth $8.
4.5
Measurement Tools
The tourism experience questionnaire was modiﬁed from a version of the MTE scale
proposed by Kim et al. and focused on four factors of tourism experience: hedonism,
novelty, local culture, and involvement.
The hedonism factor consisted of four items: (1) Visiting Herbal Lane was pleasur‐
able, (2) I indulged in the activities in Herbal Lane, (3) I really enjoyed this tourism
experience, and (4) Visiting Herbal Lane was exciting. The novelty factor consisted of
three items: (1) Visiting Herbal Lane was unique, (2) Visiting Herbal Lane was diﬀerent
from previous experiences, and (3) I experienced something new at Herbal Lane. The
local culture factor comprised two items: (1) I have a good impression of the local people
Rediscover Herbal Lane- Enhancing the Tourist Experience
453

and (2) I closely experienced the local culture. The involvement factor contained three
items: (1) I visited a place where I really wanted to go, (2) I enjoyed the activities that
I really wanted to do, and (3) I was interested in the main activities of this tourism
experience. The scales were measured using a set of paper-and-pencil questionnaires,
and each item was scored using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very strongly
disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree).

Results
Internal consistency was calculated to assess the reliability of the scales. Cronbach’s
alphas for the four factors of hedonism, novelty, local culture, and involvement were all
higher than 0.7. According to Nunnally, a Cronbach’s α value of 0.7 is adequate for
internal consistency reliability; therefore, the measures used in this study demonstrated
adequate reliability. Table 1 shows the mean scores of hedonism, novelty, local culture,
and involvement rated by the participants. A t-test was performed to examine whether
the use of mobile application aﬀected the visitors’ tourism experience regarding
hedonism, novelty, local culture, and involvement. The results showed that the mobile
application developed in this study signiﬁcantly enhanced the visitors’ tourism experi‐
ence on the four dimensions.

Hedonism
The mean of hedonism rated by the participants who used the mobile application was
5.42 (0.86) and by those who did not use mobile application was 4.53 (1.00). The
diﬀerences were statistically signiﬁcant at p < .001 by independent t-test. Based on the
survey results, participants using the mobile application had higher scores than those
without a mobile application when answering, “I indulged in the activities in Herbal
Lane” and “Visiting Herbal Lane was exciting.” The participants who used the mobile
application found the experience of visiting Herbal Lane pleasant; they enjoyed visiting
Herbal Lane and participating in the activities.

5.2
Novelty
The mean of novelty rated by the participants who used the mobile application was 5.92
and by those who did not use mobile application was 5.06. The diﬀerences were statis‐
tically signiﬁcant at p < .001 by independent t-test. Participants without the application
found the herbs being sold at the shops in Herbal Lane very novel. Their travel experi‐
ences were completely diﬀerent to their experiences of previous attractions. The partic‐
ipants with the application also felt the novelty of the Herbal Lane experience, expressing
it as a new and interesting experience to use the application to not only guide their visit
to Herbal Lane but also gain a more in-depth understanding of the herbs for health and
wellbeing. The results show that using a mobile application in a unique business district
such as Herbal Lane can improve the sense of novelty for visitors in regards to their
tourism experience.
5.3
Local Culture
The mean of local culture rated by the participants who used the mobile application was
5.50 and by those who did not use mobile application was 4.82. The diﬀerences were
statistically signiﬁcant at p < .01 by independent t-test. When the participants without
the application visited Herbal Lane, they could understand the history of Herbal Lane
through the introduction at the entrance of Herbal Lane. By contrast, the participants
who used the application while visiting Herbal Lane used the mobile application to
participate in the herb searching activities and develop an understanding of the herbs on
Herbal Lane. They could also understand related knowledge about the herbs through the
application. The information provided by the mobile application allowed the visitors to
acquire basic information about the herbs, encouraging them to inquire further about the
eﬃcacy of the herbs and how to consume the herbs. The visitors therefore gained a
deeper impression of the cultural environment of Herbal Lane than those without the
application.
5.4
Involvement
The mean of involvement rated by the participants who used the mobile application was
5.39 and by those who did not use mobile application was 4.52. The diﬀerences were
statistically signiﬁcant at p < .001 by independent t-test. The results from the survey
showed that the participants with the application were signiﬁcantly more involved than
those without the application while they were visiting Herbal Lane. They gave high
scores in their feedback for 5.40 (1.13) and 5.78 (1.01) stating, “I enjoyed the activities
that I really wanted to do” and “I was interested in the main activities of this tourism
experience.” This shows that the visitors believed that the mobile application proposed
in our study can help visitors to enjoy participating in activities in Herbal Lane, and
hence improve their degree of involvement while visiting Herbal Lane.

Conclusion
This study developed a mobile application to promote Herbal Lane’s business district
by integrating professional ﬁelds including design, computer science, and TCM. It is
hoped that the application will improve the tourism experience for visitors and help them
understand more about the herbs in Herbal Lane so that they can become potential
consumers. This study conducted a design project to approach this topic and delivered
a workable prototype—a mobile application for visiting Herbal Lane. With the workable
prototype, we carried out a user-testing study to understand whether the mobile appli‐
cation would enhance a visitor’s tourism experience. The results indicated that the
mobile application could improve visitors’ tourism experiences comparing to those
without the mobile application. Based on the ﬁndings of this study, further discussions
follow.
6.1
Enhance the Tourism Experience with Mobile Application
The mobile application proposed in this study can improve the visitors’ tourism expe‐
riences while visiting Herbal Lane. It is therefore feasible to use the mobile application
for regional promotion from the aspect of enhancing visitors’ travel experiences. The
application not only allows users to perceive a sense of joy and novelty, but can also
promote the local culture to the visitors and increase their willingness to participate
during the visit. The mobile application proposed in this study provides a new channel
for visitors to encounter Herbal Lane and the local shops, and to understand the culture
of Herbal Lane. As a result, visitors are not merely walking past attractions quickly, but
can instead gain a deeper understanding of Herbal Lane’s culture and learn about the
herbs. The practical experiments showed that the application helped the visitors to
become more involved in the activities at Herbal Lane. In addition to enjoying various
herbs, they were also more willing to ask the shop assistants about the eﬀects of those
herbs, thus forming an interaction between the shop assistants and the visitors. In addi‐
tion, by the end of the tour, since visitors gained an initial understanding of Herbal Lane,
they experienced Herbal Lane from another perspective and demonstrated a stronger
desire to make a purchase.
6.2
Increase the Touch Points
A destination ‘touch point’ is any point of contact that a visitor uses to ﬁnd out about a
product or service, or to make a purchase. Using a mobile application to enhance visitors’
tourism experiences can increase the touch points between the visitors and the place
they are visiting so that the visitors can actively interact with the people, objects, and
environment of the location. In our study, the visitors who used the application to visit
Herbal Lane gave positive feedback about the built-in interactive sections of the appli‐
cation, including the herb searching activity, which guides visitors to actively search for
the herbs that are suitable for their body constitutions. Through the pattern recognition
feature, visitors can obtain information about the herbs in Herbal Lane. The design of
the activity is exploratory, and can thus stimulate the visitors’ curiosity while increasing
456
F.-W. Tung and M. Wu

the touch points of Herbal Lane. Once the visitors have completed the herb searching
activity, the mobile application provides herb information, thus allowing the visitors to
upload the information to social media channels and share it with their friends. This
public exposure can attract more visitors in the future. Promoting cultural marketplaces,
such as Herbal Lane, by designing a mobile application that aims to increase the touch
points of the attraction increases the chances for visitors to encounter the local culture.
This is a sustainable strategy for tourist attraction sites to attract more visitors long term.
6.3
Suggestions for Future Modiﬁcations
Based on the participants’ feedback, we outline three suggestions to modify the mobile
application. The ﬁrst modiﬁcation is to oﬀer more information about Herbal Lane. When
visitors enter an unfamiliar place, they have an urge to ﬁnd out more about the place.
The mobile application can rapidly provide information in many forms. Our study results
show that a useful and easy-to-use application is essential for visitors’ travel experiences.
While the application in our study provided an experience for exploring herbs, the
participants expressed that basic information about attractions could be included and
introduced when appropriate so that the visitors could know more about the places they
visited. Another user requirement is the inclusion of a reasonable navigation route. In
our study, herb-searching activity was used to guide the visitors to Herbal Lane to
explore the herbs. Some users stated that in subsequent versions, the navigation function
of the application could be enhanced by adding a location-based service (LBS) to provide
guidance during the exploration process and to make the experience more interesting.
The third requirement is to combine multiple modalities for the interface design. A good
interface design can signiﬁcantly enhance the usability and reduce the operation burden
on the users; it can also indirectly improve the quality of the user experience. The
participants stated that the interface design of the application in this research was simple
and refreshing, which reﬂects the actual atmosphere of Herbal Lane. Regrettably, the
operating interface designed for this study focused on the presentation of the visual
arrangement; however, the participants stated that audio feedback and presentation
would enhance the usability. Subsequent designs should therefore use an improved
visual interface and audio feedback to enhance users’ interest in the exploratory game
and the guidance provided by the interface.

Abstract. Research indicates that one of the key drivers of the development of
m-commerce is the provision of various types of high-quality mobile applications/
services (apps). Business managers have thus been devoting themselves into not
only attracting new customers but also retaining existing customers. Despite the
considerable amount of studies on mobile apps, there are few studies that specif‐
ically investigate the eﬀects of mobile-service-related quality factors on m-
commerce consumers’ continuance intention regarding speciﬁc mobile apps. This
study thus develops a research model that describe the relationships among
mobile-service-quality factors (interaction quality, environment quality, and
outcome quality), customer satisfaction, and the mobile-apps users’ continuance
intention. The proposed research model was empirically validated using data
collected from the users of mobile apps in Taiwan. The research results indicate
that the three quality factors were key determinants of customer satisfaction and
continuance intention. Theoretical and practical implications are subsequently
discussed.

Introduction
Because of the increasing popularity of mobile devices, including smart phones and
tablets, the market potential of mobile commerce (m-commerce) has been growing all
over the world. The emergence of the m-commerce era and the prosperous development
of mobile technologies enable the mobile devices to serve as not only communication
devices but also multi-functional personal digital assistants in people’s daily lives.
Research indicates that one of the key drivers of the development of m-commerce is the
provision of various types of high-quality mobile applications/services (mobile apps).

Compared to the conventional electronic commerce (e-commerce) services, mobile
apps has the unique characteristics, including location-awareness, conditions of usage,
adaptivity, ubiquity, personalization, and broadcasting, which allow customers to use
mobile applications/services anytime and anywhere. Because the current mobile appli‐
cation/service market is highly competitive, business managers have thus been devoting
themselves into not only attracting new customers but also retaining existing customers.
Additionally, research indicates that the unit cost of acquiring a new customer is much
higher than that of retaining an existing customer, enhancing customers’ continuance
intention is critical to mobile application providers in terms of cost saving and business
expansion. Consequently, there have been many studies that investigate critical factors
inﬂuencing the intention of the users of mobile apps to continue to use those applications
in order to provide managers of corporations with guidelines regarding the establishment
of favorable long-term relationships with their customers in order to acquire sustainable
competitive advantages.
Although a considerable amount of the mobile apps are provided to m-commerce
consumers for free, those consumers tend to consider carefully regarding the use of a
speciﬁc mobile application/service in terms of whether the use of a particular mobile
app would satisfy their speciﬁcs needs the most before downloading them because of
the concern regarding the relatively limited storage space and operating capabilities of
their mobile devices. Therefore, good service quality of mobile apps can enhance
customers’ satisfaction regarding their use experience of those mobile apps, which, in
turn, decrease customers’ intentions to switch to competing mobile apps. However, there
are few studies that speciﬁcally investigate the eﬀects of mobile-service-related quality
factors on m-commerce consumers’ continuance intention regarding speciﬁc mobile
apps. It is thus diﬃcult for us to identify the key success factors that signiﬁcantly inﬂu‐
ence the variation of customer loyalty to a speciﬁc mobile app. Consequently, how to
strengthen m-commerce users’ intention to continue to use speciﬁc mobile apps via
improving mobile service quality is considered to be an important issue that deserves
extra research eﬀorts.
Based on the discussion of our research background and motivations represented
above, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships among mobile services
quality, customer satisfaction, and customers’ continuance intention from the viewpoint
of mobile service quality. This study thus proposes a research model that depicts how
the three mobile-service-related quality constructs, including interaction quality, envi‐
ronment quality, and outcome quality, aﬀect customer satisfaction and customers’
continuance intention regarding a speciﬁc mobile app.

Literature Review
In this section, we introduce the development of mobile services and mobile applica‐
tions. Then, we discuss service quality from the perspective of m-commerce to ﬁnd out
the key quality factors that may aﬀect customer satisfaction and continuance intention
of mobile apps’ users. Finally, a research model is proposed to investigate the eﬀects of
the key quality factors on the customer satisfaction and continuance intention.

2.1
Mobile Applications/Services
Because of the exceptional development of mobile devices, the major form of mobile
services is mobile apps in the current mobile commerce market. Taylor et al. [1] deﬁne
mobile apps as small programs that run on mobile devices and perform missions such
as internet banking, gaming, or web page browsing. In 2012, 54.9 % of cell phone users
in the U.S. use smartphones as a result of the popularity of mobile apps. Nielsen reports
that from 2011 to the second quarter of 2012, the average number of apps installed on
a smartphone has increased from 32 to 41.
However, because the number of mobile apps in the market is increasing rapidly,
mobile service providers are encountering ﬁerce competition in the marketplace. Conse‐
quently, it is critical for mobile service providers to ﬁnd out the critical success factors
of enhancing customers’ continuance intention. Many studies have been focusing on
this issue and most of them highlight the importance of the construct of service quality
in the information systems success model proposed by DeLone and McLean [2] in
understanding the success of mobile apps. Although many academics consider m-
commerce as an extension of e-commerce, m-commerce services are quite diﬀerent from
traditional e-commerce services because of their unique service attributes and industry
features. Consequently, the evaluation of service quality of mobile services should be
based on the service quality evaluation models that take into considerations of the unique
features of m-commerce.
2.2
Mobile Service Quality
Previous research of customer satisfaction has indicated that service quality is an impor‐
tant evaluation index [3]. Service quality plays a key role in helping diﬀerent industries
evaluate if they clearly understand customers’ needs in traditional business environment.
At the era of Internet, service still plays an inﬂuential role in electronic commerce and
mobile commerce [4, 5]. However, many corporations simply use web sites and mobile
services as new tools of posting static company information on the Internet, but do not
appropriately take advantage of web sites and mobile services for boosting companies’
businesses. When users reply more and more heavily on various web-based applications
in their daily lives, how to provide them with better services to attract customers and
how to evaluate the service quality of mobile services have become a major concern to
corporations.
The arrival of mobile commerce era motivates mobile service providers to develop
methods that help them appropriately evaluate the perceived mobile service quality of
customers in order to achieve higher customer satisfaction and to increase the value of
services in the extremely competitive environment of mobile services [6–8]. A review
of the literature regarding the evaluation of the mobile service quality reveals that most
of the existing studies focus on the viewpoint of customer satisfaction. For example,
Kim et al. [6] use summarize the ﬁndings of prior literature [9–11] to develop a theo‐
retical framework to deﬁne the six dimensions of mobile service quality, including call
quality, value-added services, customer support, loss cost, move-in cost, and interper‐
sonal relationship. Brady and Cronin [3] also propose a framework that incorporates

461

three primary dimensions of mobile service quality (interaction quality, physical envi‐
ronment quality and outcome quality). However, the dimensions of service quality
proposed by Brady and Cronin [3] are limited to the measurement of service quality in
traditional service contexts. The sub-dimensions, for example, ambient condition/social
factors, are not applicable in measuring the service quality of virtual services. Therefore,
Lu et al. [8] reﬁne Brady and Cronin’s [3] framework and propose a model of mobile
service quality. Their model consists of three primary dimensions: interaction quality,
environment quality, and outcome quality. Thus, this study chooses mobile applications
as the main research subject from various mobile services and adopts Lu et al.’s [8]
mobile service quality model for our investigations. This framework of mobile service
quality includes three primary dimensions. First, interaction quality refers to quality of
a customer’s interaction with the mobile service provider during the service delivery.
Additionally, environment quality refers to quality evaluation of customers toward
utility equipment, interface design, and the appropriateness of provided contents.
Finally, outcome quality refers to the service experience that customers perceive during
the service delivery process and what customers are left with when the service procedure
is ﬁnished.

Research Model and Research Hypotheses
Based on the results of our literature review, a theoretical model to assess the consumers’
satisfaction and continuance intention with regard to mobile applications is developed,
as presented in Fig. 1. In the remaining part of this section, the development of our
research hypotheses will be discussed in details.
Fig. 1. The research model
The eﬀects of service quality on user satisfaction have been discussed in many studies
[2, 3, 12, 13]. A lot of investigations have also been made in the existing marketing
literature of mobile business [8, 14, 15].
Chae et al. [16] argue that connection quality, content quality, interaction quality,
and contextual quality will aﬀect user satisfaction. Connection quality and content
quality refer to the stability and the usefulness of the information of mobile services,
462
W.-T. Wang and W.-Y. Chen

which are believed to aﬀect user satisfaction. In this study, these two qualities are
classiﬁed into environment quality. Interaction quality refers to the interactive relation‐
ship with service providers, including the most used positioning and navigation func‐
tions. Finally, contextual quality belongs to one of the sub-dimensions of the outcome
quality. To mobile application customers, the user satisfaction would be enhanced when
service providers provide the required services at the right time. Chiou and Droge [17]
also indicate that interactive service quality plays a key role in forming user satisfaction,
because it aﬀects how customers perceive the service quality. Kuo et al. [18] point out
that factors including interface design, system reliability, connection stability (i.e., envi‐
ronment quality) can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the user satisfaction of mobile services.
Finally, Dabholkar and Overby [19] investigate real estate agents and ﬁnd out that
outcome quality is closely connected to customer satisfaction. However, Zhao et al. [15]
indicate that even though that the service quality is high, the negative WOM of outcome
quality for services or commodities will create unpleasant shopping experiences to
customers and the degree of customer satisfaction would be low. Based on the discussion
above, the following hypotheses are developed.
H1: Interaction quality positively inﬂuences user satisfaction regarding a mobile appli‐
cation.
H2: Environment quality positively inﬂuences user satisfaction regarding a mobile
application.
H3: Outcome quality positively inﬂuences user satisfaction regarding a mobile appli‐
cation.
From the viewpoint of mobile service providers, the purpose for providing satisﬁed
services is to attract customers to continually use their mobile services, and thus to
increase customers’ adhesion of services for acquiring more commercial beneﬁts. In the
e-commerce ﬁeld, Bhattacherjee [20] points out that satisfaction is a key predictor of
users’ continuance use intention. Additionally, Riel et al. [21] ﬁnd out that satisfaction
positively inﬂuenced customers’ continuance use intention of portal sites. The above
literature have proved that customers’ satisfaction with products or services will directly
or indirectly aﬀect their willingness to repurchase or reuse [22–24]. In summary, user
satisfaction and continuance use intention usually have a positive relationship. There‐
fore, the following hypothesis is proposed.
H4: User satisfaction positively inﬂuences users’ continuance intention regarding a
mobile application.

Data Collection and Analysis
4.1
Instrument Development
To develop an eﬀective survey, 47 items relevant to the ﬁve constructs of the research
model were adapted from the existing literature and reﬁned based on the speciﬁc topic
Assessing the Eﬀects of Mobile Service Quality
463

of this study. All of the survey items were pilot-tested with 34 individuals who had
experience in using mobile applications on a daily basis. The internal consistency and
reliability were examined using Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcient analysis. The question‐
naire was further reﬁned based on the results and feedback from the pilot test. The ﬁnal
questionnaire consisted of 42 items. Items included in the ﬁnal revised questionnaire
were considered highly reliable because the individual Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcients of
all the ﬁrst-order constructs reached the recommended level of 0.7 (ranging from 0.77
to 0.90). The items in the survey were measured using a seven-point Likert scale ranging
from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree.
4.2
Data Collection and Analysis
The data for this study were collected using an online questionnaire to survey consumers
who had experience in using mobile applications on a daily basis in Taiwan. The most
popular online bulletin board system (i.e., the PTT) were selected as the survey distri‐
bution channels. Of the 367 questionnaires received, 72 incomplete or problematic
responses were later removed, yielding 295 valid responses and a rate of useful response
of 80.4 %.
The technique of the component-based structural equation modeling (SEM), namely
the partial least squares (PLS), was adopted for the data analysis procedure of this study.
The reliability of the measures for each of the ﬁve latent constructs was ﬁrst tested by
examining the individual Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcients. For the ﬁve constructs inves‐
tigated, all of these were greater than the recommended level of 0.7 or higher (ranging
from 0.70 to 0.90). Then, using the SPSS and SmartPLS 2.0 software packages, the
psychometric properties (i.e., construct validity) of the measurement model were
assessed in terms of convergent and discriminant validity [25, 26].
Three primary measures were used to evaluate the convergent validity of the meas‐
urement model: (a) the factor loadings of the indicators, which must be statistically
signiﬁcant with values greater than 0.6; (b) composite reliability (CR), with values
greater than 0.6; and (c) average variance extracted (AVE) estimates, with values greater
than 0.5. The results of our analysis indicate that all factor loadings (ranging from 0.67
to 0.93) of the measures used were statistically signiﬁcant, and all were larger than the
restrictive criterion of 0.6. Additionally, all CR values (ranging from 0.82 to 0.92) were
higher than 0.6, indicating a reliable measurement model. Finally, the AVE values
ranged from 0.60 to 0.65, indicating that each construct was strongly related to its
respective indicators. Overall, the measurement model exhibited adequate convergent
validity. Finally, the discriminant validity of the measurement model was determined
to be satisfactory, since the squared correlations between constructs were smaller than
the corresponding AVE estimates [25]. To conclude, the measurement model was
adequate.
By adopting the PLS technique using the bootstrapping procedure, the structural
model was evaluated for hypotheses testing. Bootstrapping of the 295 cases (the same
as the original sample size) was conducted with 1000 samples to evaluate the signiﬁ‐
cance of the proposed research hypotheses. Figure 2 presents the standardized path
coeﬃcients and t values, the signiﬁcance of the paths, and the coeﬃcients of
464

determination (R2) for each endogenous construct. As shown in Fig. 2, all the hypotheses
were supported by the data.

Discussion and Conclusion
This study has developed and validated a research model for explaining the satisfaction
and continuance intentions of mobile application/service users by adopting the perspec‐
tive of mobile service quality. Interaction quality, environment quality, and outcome
quality were all found to be signiﬁcant factors in determining user satisfaction and
continuance intentions regarding mobile applications/services. The research ﬁndings
can thus provide mobile service providers with signiﬁcant insights into how factors of
mobile service quality may impact the continuous adoption of mobile applications/
services. Additionally, the validation of the proposed research model has provided
support of simultaneously adoption of interaction quality, environment quality, and
outcome quality as key factors inﬂuencing users’ continuance intentions in the context
of the use of mobile applications/services. To further extend the contribution of this
study, more research that aims to examine the proposed research model using a variety
of samples that have a higher degree of representativeness in similar and diﬀerent
contexts is thus needed to further validate it, or reﬁne it by identifying additional vari‐
ables which can enhance the ability of the proposed research model to explain and predict
the satisfaction and continuance intentions of the users of mobile applications/services,
such as diﬀerent dimensions of users’ trust in the mobile service providers (as the
reﬂection of the inﬂuence of mobile service quality), habit of mobile service users, and
other key mobile service quality factors.

Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to study the inﬂuence of smartphone
application arrangement on user performance of completing a sub-task and
satisfaction in the course of telephoning. Base on simulated smartphone inter-
face, three kinds of application arrangement are designed for the experiment.
Participants begin to conduct another application in a kind of application
arrangement while telephoning. The results show that the user’s operation time
is the shortest and satisfaction is the best while frequent applications arranged on
the telephoning interface. And the followed is the applied application arranged

Introduction
With the emergence of smart phones, applications which with varieties of functions
have been appearing, these applications can be used in playing games, navigation,
taking photos, learning and so on, in 2015, there are about 1,400,000 kinds of appli-
cations for apple smart phone and about 1,830,000 kinds of applications for android
mobile phone [1], in which the apple mobile users’ download has reached 1 billion
times. But due to the limited screen size and too many applications have been
downloading, the users’ needs to organize them on the mobile phone interface
according to the certain way.
The early mobile phone menu organization form is mostly static form, mainly
including scrolling menu and hierarchy menu etc., studies have shown that scrolling
menu will lower the efﬁciency of operation [2, 3], but the deeper of hierarchy menu
level, the more time users need to spend to learn, and the more wrong choice made on
possible paths [3, 4], compared the operation performance of hierarchy menu with the
scrolling menu on the small screen, it is found that the operation performance of
hierarchy menu is superior to scrolling menu [5].
For smartphone users who need to install new applications and delete old appli-
cations constantly, if these applications presented by static way, obviously that can
cause trouble to the user. Method applied at present is mainly hierarchical management
which is classifying the application or paging in sequence [6, 7], the study also con-
sidered that using adaptive user interface can also solve this problem [8, 9], an adaptive

user interface can change its layout, function, structure elements according to user’s
behavior [10–12], Mitchell and Shneiderman order the arrangement of menu items
from high to low according to the usage frequency of menu item. Results showed that
this method did not improve the operation performance, users prefer traditional static
menus. Due to this method has changed the original structure of the interface, thus
undermining the user’s mental model [13]. While someone improved the operation
performance with this method [14]. At present, for the adaptive menu interface of
mobile phone, there are some research started to study in the aspects of situation
awareness, shortcuts, etc. [15, 16].
With the continuous expansion of the functions of programs, there is a growing
need for the use of other functions while people using a certain function of one
application in mobile phone, which namely is that don’t turn off one function which is
used, at the same time using another or several functions, for example, someone ﬁnds
the map while telephoning. For such a large screen of computer and it can present
multiple applications on the same interface, whereas it’s usually difﬁcult to present two
or more application interfaces on the same interface, and small size screen will make it
hard for users to form mental model on the menu structure, and beyond the capacity of
short-term memory [17]. If the user needs to open another one at the same time, which
way that the organization of these applications will be presented and makes higher
operation performance and better satisfaction is particularly important.
Due to the different navigation effect of different application arrangements on users,
therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of smartphone application
arrangement on the operation performance and users’ subjective satisfaction of com-
pleting sub-task under the conditions of the implementation of the main tasks.

Experimental Design
In order to study the inﬂuence of the application arrangement of the adaptive menu
structure on the operation performance and the subjective satisfaction of users who
complete the sub-tasks, the Flash software was used to simulate the mobile phone
interface so that participants are able to test by it. Firstly, three kinds of application
arrangement are designed, and the participants can complete the main task of the
calling under a menu structure in an application arrangement, at the same time they
need to complete a sub-task of another application.
2.1
The Application Arrangement of the Menu and Simulation Interface
There are three kinds of application arrangement in the experiment:
Common menu, according to the using frequency of the menu items, the six most
frequent items will be presented on the main task interface. If you need other items, you
should click on the “home” button and then return to the main interface to ﬁnd nec-
essary menu items.
History menu, according to the time sequence, which means the used items nearer
to the current time then the items presented more ahead. The used items will be
Research on the Impact of Menu Structure of Smart Phones
469

presented on the main task interface. If you need the unused ones, you should click on
the “home” button and then return to the main interface to ﬁnd necessary menu items.
Hierarchy menu, the ﬁrst level of the items will be presented on the main task
interface, and the following sub menu items will be presented after clicking the ﬁrst
level menu item.
According to the three kinds of application arrangement, the experiment has ﬁve
simulation interfaces. The interface 1 is the main interface, rendering all the application
icons, establishing the link relations to the “home” button on interface 2–4. The main
interface has two pages, with a total of 34 application icons. The icons are divided into
two types– the task icons and the common icons. The ﬁrst page has 20 application
icons, including 4 task icons and the 16 common icons. There are 14 application icons
on the second page, including 2 task icons and 12 common icons. The task icons are
the ones which are chosen by the participants in the process of the experiment tasks.
The interface 2 simulates the common menu; the interface function elements
include the telephone icon and six commonly used function icons, and a “home” button
(Fig. 1).
The interface 3 simulates the history menu; the interface function elements include
the phone icon and used application icons. The used application icons can be viewed
by sliding around the button, and the icons will be presented at the bottom of the
interface (Fig. 2).

The interface 4 simulates the Hierarchy menu; all the applications are presented by
two levels. The four classiﬁcations in the ﬁrst level are presented by four icons and the
applications in the second level are categorized into the four types. Clicking on the
icons in the ﬁrst level all the applications contained will appear; and these four cate-
gories are “life”, “entertainment”, “social”, “system”, respectively (Fig. 3).
The interface 5 is the ending interface.
The experiment simulates the mode of touch interaction interface of mobile phones;
the size of the simulation interface is 7.9 * 5.8 cm, and the icon size is 1.3 * 1.3 cm
with the menu name placed right under the icon; the font is song typeface and the font
size is 9 pt.

2.2
Experiment Tasks and Processes
There are 18 people tested in the experiment; the age range is about 20 to 30 years old,
with an average age of 24. Their using time of mobile phone is more than 3 years. The
participants are grouped into three groups by random. The participants in each group
only use one kind of menu organization in the experiment. Each participant will
complete four different tasks:
Task 1: when you are chatting with your friend on the phone, he/she sends you an
email, and this email is very important, which need you to ﬁnd this email right now.
Task 2: now you are chatting with your friend on the phone, at this moment your
WeChat ringing; you receive a WeChat message, and you want to view the contents
of this message right now.
Task 3: now you are chatting with your friend on the phone, at this moment you
ﬁnd the roadside scenery is very beautiful; you want to take photo by the cell
phones.
Task 4: now you are on the phone with your friends, and your friend is telling you
how to reach the destination, but you can’t ﬁnd the right direction, so you need to
use a compass application in the cell phone to determine the azimuth.
Before the start of the experiment, the participants should understand the research
purpose of the experiment by the introduction of the experiment, sign the “informed
consent”, and ﬁll in the tables of personal basic information and mobile phone usage
information. Then they need to be introduced the experimental simulation interface,
and practice until the participants believe that they have already been familiar with the
interface.
In ofﬁcial experiment, the simulation interface of mobile phone will be displayed
on the screen of computer; participants start the tasks as soon as they heard “start” and
timing begins, after the participants found the target icon, the interface prompts into
work and end time. In the process of implementing the task, the TobiiStudio eye tracker
will record the participant’s line of sight and recording its operation behavior. After
completing all tasks, the participants need to ﬁll the satisfaction questionnaire.

The Results and Analysis of the Experiment
Table 1 shows the mean and variance of the completion time of the task under the
condition of different application arrangement. The data shows that the average time to
complete task 3 is 2.31(s), which is the shortest one for common menu. In this menu,
the average time to complete task 4 is 8.44(s), which is the longest one. The average
time to complete all task is 4.48(s). About history menu, the average time to completing
task 2 and task 4 are shorter than others. They are 1.57(s) and 1.90(s). The average time
to complete task 3 is 25.62(s), which is the longest one. In this menu, the average time
to complete all task is 8.41(s). For hierarchy menu, the average time to complete task 2
is 3.93(s) which is the shortest one. The longest time is the average time to complete
task 1 which is 12.10(s). In this menu the average time to complete all task is 10.43(s).

Thus, the operating time for common menu is the shortest. Figure 1 present the
average time to complete tasks in different application arrangement intuitively.
Table 2 shows the mean and variance of the focuses in the process of the task under
the condition of different application arrangement. For common menu, the data shows
that the average focuses in the process of task 3 are 30.50, which is the least quantity;
the focuses in the process of task 4 are 52.17, which is the most quantity. The average
focuses in the process of all tasks are 36.96. About history menu, the average focuses in
the process of task 2 and task 4 are less than others’. They are 19.67 and 28.50. The
average focuses in the process of task 3 are 92.67, which is the most quantity. In this
menu, the average focuses in the process of all task are 46.75. For hierarchy menu, the
average focuses in the process of task 2 are 26.67, which is the least quantity. The most
focuses are the average focuses in the process of task 1 which are 76.67. In this menu
the average focuses in the process of all task are 43.96. Thus, the quantity of focuses for
common menu is the least. Figure 2 present the average focuses in the process of tasks
in different menu organization form intuitively.
Table 3 shows the mean and variance of the participants’ satisfaction under the
condition of different application arrangement. The average participants’ satisfaction
about common menu is 6.35, 5.35 for history menu and 4.90 for hierarchy menu. So the
most popular menu is the common menu. The history menu is worst (Figs. 4 and 5).

Conclusions
The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the organization form of mobile
phone applications on the operation performance of completing sub-task and subjective
satisfaction of users under the implementation of the main task. Experimental results
show that the operation time and subjective satisfaction of the users under the common
menu are signiﬁcantly better than the history menu and hierarchy menu, following by
history menu.
Despite the fact that the screen of smartphone only presents a single interface of the
application when the current users in the operation of an application, but with the
increasing of functions of smartphone applications, there are more and more demands
to operate two or more applications at the same time, for the small screen, how to
improve its operation performance and satisfaction while users in the operation of a
function of an application and easy to ﬁnd other applications at the same time, which
are closely related with the application arrangement.

Abstract. Many Chinese get familiar with Japan via comics, animations, movies
or dramas; especially some scenes in these works were actually drawn on real
life. Recently, touring to these places is an on-going new reason for visiting Japan.
However, ﬁnding the scenes from the real world without a guide is very diﬃcult,
and collecting the information about the location of scenes always cost plenty of
time on Internet. This paper clariﬁes the conditions of designing a new media
system to raise Chinese tourists’ joyfulness out of the holy pilgrimage trip, and
proposes a new media system to support them to record and share distinct routes
for location of scenes.
Keywords: Chinese tourist · Seichi Junrei · Japanese culture · Holy land ·
Pilgrimage · Record · Location of scenes

Introduction
Seichi Junrei, a Japanese word, which describes this phenomenon, is accepted by Japa‐
nese popular culture that means pilgrimage to sacred places of Japanese animations,
dramas and movies. It is also called contents tourism. To most Chinese, Japan is not
only an exquisite neighboring country, but also has unique and precious culture that
fascinates them. Chinese tourists who are deeply impressed by Japanese comics, anima‐
tion, movies and dramas start to seek and visit the location of scenes in Japan. The best
example is Slam Dunk, the most popular Japanese animation in China, when broadcasted
in late 1990s that turns almost every teenager a super-fan to it. Nonetheless after around
15 years, those teenage audiences are in their late 20s and early 30s, but the topics of
Slam Dunk are still quite popular in all Chinese social medias. Moreover, most of them
are not aware of that all scenes in Slam Dunk are existed in real life until the emergence
of Internet and social media, for example the main anime set was originated from Kana‐
gawa. Although there are lots of Japanese smartphone applications or websites are
designed to promote Seichi Junrei and to inform users the locations of some important
scenes, it is not user-friendly to those foreigners who do not speak Japanese or even do
not know the existence of certain products but have strong interest of Seichi Junrei. In
addition, searching information before the visit is quite time consuming, and some
potential visitors may lose interests over complications. Find a trustful guide is a good
alternative, but the cost may scare some low-budget travellers away. Moreover, the
information about the movie sets is quite dispersed on Internet thus hard to be collected,

which further led to many travellers had to choose a package tour or group tour to meet
their demand.
Weibo, a China-based micro-blogging service, was launched in 2009 and became
one of the most popular social media platforms in China. Attributes to the prosperous
development of Internet infrastructure and independence from big social-media players,
the Chinese Internet environment oﬀers fertile soil for Weibo, whom has gained 220
million monthly active users as to Sep 2015 [1]. Not long ago, the only channel to obtain
information about Japanese comics, animation, movies and dramas was mass media.
Nowadays people can search in social media and investigate what other users just post
immediately, and even ﬁnd new friends who share common topics, such as Japan. In
China, the use of Internet has reached 90.3 % user coverage and far exceeded the use of
television and newspapers to get latest information and news that are related to Japan
[2]. According to the interviews conducted by Zhou [3], 39 Japanese local governments
have opened their oﬃcial Weibo accounts in order to promote their cities and attract
more Chinese tourist. The popularity of Weibo began to change the behavior of both
Chinese tourists and Japanese tourism organizations.
This papers aims to ﬁnd a way to support holy pilgrimage trip for Chinese. Regarding
the diﬃculties of Chinese free tour in Japan, this paper proposes a new media tool to
support tourists to ﬁnd, record and share distinct routes for location of scenes. The later
part will conduct as follows: First, analyze the behavior of Chinese tourists in Japan,
followed with description of the concept of the media tool. Secondly, present analyses
of ﬁve experiments of Slam Dunk pilgrimage, by consulting my contents in a reality
recording system designed by Utsumi [4]. In the last section, the results and future work
will be explained.

Analysis of Chinese Tourist Behavior in Japan
For deeper understanding of how to assist Chinese tourists to enjoy the contents tourism,
this study conducts three diﬀerent surveys and interviews to understand why Chinese
tourists are traveling in Japan, what are their wishes and expectations. The details are
as follows:
2.1
Demographical Analysis
The ﬁrst survey was conducted during June 12th, 2015 to June 22th, 2015. The number
of participants is 42. The study shows that most Chinese chose participating the group-
tour as their ﬁrst tour in Japan. Before their trips, they searched on Weibo or consulted
friends who have been to Japan before. For the reason why traveling to Japan, 50 % of
them claimed the short distance and the other 30 % were attracted by Japanese anima‐
tions, dramas, movies. Moreover, 80 % of them expressed that they want to have a look
about the locations of scenes.
It shows that most group-tour tourists were also looking forward visiting the loca‐
tions of scenes, which were excluded from the pre-designed itinerary. Thus, Seichi Junrei
will have strong potential among Chinese free independent tourists.

2.2
Behavior Analysis
In order to ﬁgure out the motivation and behavior of Chinese free tourists, we conducted
the following interview and experiment.
Interview in Kawagoe. Kawagoe is a small city in Saitama Prefecture, and local resi‐
dents prefer to call it “The Little Edo”, because most of its architectures are remained
in Edo-time style. Chinese tourists are not common there because this city is not in a
typical Chinese group-tour’s itinerary. However, with the broadcasting of Japanese
animation, Kamisama Kiss, younger generation starts to notice it (Fig. 1). We managed
to interview 10 Chinese tourists there. Two young people are attracted to Kawagoe
because of this animation. Even though they understand their trip is alike Seichi Junrei,
there was not a Chinese tool could help them to get information, thus they spent a lot of
time on searching online and planning, all by themselves.
Fig. 1. The animation and the real location of the scene in Kawagoe
In contrast, the other eight middle-aged participants who were brought there by
friends, knowing no more information other than “it is a traditional city”. They heavily
relied on their friends as tourist guide and interpreter because they do not speak Japanese
and manage simple English thus they also have not derived any information from foreign
websites in advance.
From our perspective, the lack of a systemized tool in Chinese is inconvenient for
most Chinese who wish to have a free trip, not to mention Seichi Junrei.
Experiment in Holy Land Pilgrimage. In China, Paradise Kiss, Shitsuren Choco‐
latier, and Lost in Translation are three well-known movies and dramas about Japan and
each of them has numerous fans on Weibo. We requested two groups to have a Seichi
Junrei about the three movies and dramas on October 21th, 2015. The Weibo group can
search the three mentioned works on Weibo during the progress while the comparison
group did not prepare in advance but just visiting some locations of scenes. The result
shows that the Weibo group created more topics, took more photos, located more original
shooting locations and enjoyed the experiment more than the comparison group.

479

With the help of Weibo, Chinese tourists could easily recall storyline and original
scenes continuously and enjoy recording photos and instant experiences. Regarding the
interview and the experiment above, a systemized Chinese media tool that provides great
information about Japanese animations and dramas is extremely necessary to Chinese
free trip tourists.
3
System Concept
According to the survey of Chinese Tourist above, as a media for supporting holy land
trip of Chinese, the following conditions were found to be necessary:
1. A Chinese system;
2. Quoting from Weibo;
3. Recording photograph.
Thus, we propose a media tool for Chinese pilgrims that can record pictures and
experiences of the special location in reality, while at the same time can show the virtual
world and topics of the same location via Weibo.
The main feature of the tool is, ﬁrstly, in order to ensure that Chinese tourists could
immerse into a Seichi Junrei journey, a platform with attractive content and rich topics
is very important. And Weibo can play such role. As the previous experiment implies,
that if a tourist refreshes a topic about certain animation when who is travelling at the
locations, he/she will receive fertile resources of that animation. Forms of those
resources could be photographs, video clips, screenshots or texts that could evoke
his/her memories of the animation and be better immersed into the joyfulness of Seichi
Junrei.
Secondly, we use Whispath, a recording media related to locations, designed by
Utsumi. It is diﬀerent from other social medias due to its unique function of adding
location information under the texts and the posts are displayed directly on the Google
map. Every user would see all other users even if they have not ‘added’ or ‘followed’
the other. We use the system to support Chinese pilgrims to record photos and texts of
their familiar scenes (Fig. 2). The tourists could take advantages of pioneers’ recordings
when visiting holy land pilgrimages. The photos and texts previous recorders that are
showed on the map will guide them to movies sets or original animation scenes when
they approaching the right spot.
Every time when users upload photos and texts, they need to type a name of the route
and record a Seichi Junrei on the interface. Then they can review theirs or others’ paths
by selecting the name.
The objects that are recorded by pilgrims could be an ordinary school or even a
crossroad, other than general understanding of a tourist ‘attraction’. Because those
objects are junctions of virtual and actual worlds, and from general tourists’ perspective
it is meaningless and they would not record them. However the Seichi Junrei recording
is taking impressions of a work as a reference to understanding and marking an actual
480
N. Zhang and K. Ogawa

place. General tourists are motivated by online posts of attracting sceneries or recom‐
mendations of previous tourists, but pilgrims track clues from virtual worlds and connect
to real world or follow previous pilgrims’ experiences.
4
Experiment
According to the user-centered design stories [5], in order to know the record preferences
and conventions of Chinese tourists when they are having a holy land pilgrimage, it is
important to conduct an experiment with typical users in a real-world environment in
the design process.
4.1
Methods
As one of the most inﬂuential animations and comics, Slam Dunk (a story about some
basketball teams in diﬀerent high schools) is a typical work that suits for this test. Thus,
Enoshima, where is the location of Slam Dunk in Kanagawa is chosen to be the test
place. This media is designed for Chinese tourists, therefore the test subjects must be
the Chinese who have watched Slam Dunk before and are interested in visiting the real
location. The Experiments were conducted in December 2015 and January 2016 in
Enoshima, Kanagawa, Japan, and ﬁve Chinese participants were involved excluding me.
The experiment was mainly aimed at the following pilgrims [6]. We created the ﬁrst
recording of Slam Dunk in the prototype. The ﬁrst participant referred on our contents,
and the second participant referred on both the ﬁrst participant’s recording and ours.
The latter ones referred on all the previous contents. All of them uploaded their own
records in the system as they consulted from the existing information.

4.2
Supporting System
From the three supporting conditions (A Chinese system, the consultation of Weibo and
the picture recording), which are previously identiﬁed in the concept we’ve selected
picture recording as the main subject of this experiment. By utilizing Whispath, the
experiment aim to discover the subject’s problems and eﬀectiveness when being used
in the Chinese holy land pilgrimage.
4.3
Contents
All of the participants took Enoden (i.e. the Enoshima Electric Railway) as the only
transport vehicle, which is also an important element in Slam Dunk. Experiments started
from the departure station of Enoden, Fujisawa Station. As the initiate recorder, we
checked a lot of information about location and station on Weibo and blogs in advance.
Also we took some screenshots from the scenes that are related to Enoshima. We were
consulting the prepared information, screenshots and Weibo as we were seeking for the
right positions in the progress of Seichi Junrei. When we matched the virtual scenes and
actual place, the photos and texts were updated to the system. Took our recordings as
reference, the system of experiments was ready. Five participants followed contents to
start recording their Seichi Junrei.
4.4
Results
All of the details of record locations are as below (Table 1). The reference locations
come from our recording.
Note: The ﬁrst ﬁve locations were recorded in the pioneers’ recordings.
Two participants, ﬁrst and third recorded less than ours. The second, the forth and
the last participants mark more diﬀerent locations than those. Especially the second and
the ﬁfth subjects, they not only recorded Slam Dunk, but also marked TariTari and
Tsuritama, two animations that also take Enoshima as the background.
The ﬁrst participant said if this tool will be available in near future, she would not
spend any time for preparing a Seichi Junrei trip any more. However, she mentioned
even though she found pieces of recordings uploaded by pioneer pilgrim about Slam
Dunk at the right spot, it is still diﬃcult to match. Moreover, she complained that she
had to re-type the user name and path name every time when updating new recording.
The second subject was not only a following pilgrim to Slam Dunk, but also a
pioneering pilgrim to the other two animations in Enoshima. At beginning, she was upset
because no consulting pictures about the two animations (TariTari and Tsuritama). Then
she searched lots of screenshots as consultations and took pictures together with the
virtual screenshots and real photos.
When the third recorder re-entered the name of the path to upload more pictures, he
miss-spelled it and some recordings were showed under another path, without his notice.
Resulted to an uncompleted path of Seichi Junrei. Also she mentioned that the user
interface does not match smartphone application and not easy to use.

Some subjects felt more easily to find the locations of scenes with the help of the
system, but they also experienced inaccurate marking location due to imprecise navigation.

Behavioral Analysis
As a unique feature of Japanese culture, ACG (animation, comic and game) absolutely
becomes one of the best selling points to attract people from all over the world, especially
Asian youngsters who prefer free tour than package tour. From the research of Benjamin
[7], many Hong Kong youth care more about pop-culture tourism than heritage tourism
or nature tourism. They may visit Tokyo University or small infamous shrine or Koshien
(a baseball game) that relate to animations or comics, instead of visiting any traditional
tourist attractions. According the behavior of the ﬁve Chinese participants, we picked
up the typical three of them to analyze.
• The tourist who has never been to Enoshima
The first participant, she had never been to Japan but still chose the free tour. She did
not do any preparation in advance and only accounted on the recordings that were created
by me. She got off at the Kamakurakokomae Station where is the spot of Ryonan High
School Station in Slam Dunk. Nonetheless the appearance of the real station was exactly
reproduced in the animation, however, she did not recognize the scene in the real world
until she found the comic pictures updated by us was right in there. When she suddenly
realized what in front of her is the scene that she has watched numerous times in the
animation, the tone of her comments are with amazement as dream come true. ‘I could not
believe I am at the crossing!’ ‘That is the legendary Ryonan high school!’ She was so
happy to be enlightened with the comparisons of comic picture and the real scene. After she
checked all the previous location recording there, she chose to take pictures of the station,
the railway crossing and Kamakura high school that the three most presented scenes on
Weibo (Fig. 3). In early 2000s, Internet assisted spreading digital production and sharing
contents to the mass [8, 9]. Here the media plays a prominent role in leading pilgrims.
Especially with the prosperous development of social media, personal contributed infor‐
mation possesses vital referencing value. The previous recording left by us recalled her
some scenes of Slam Dunk. In addition, information on Weibo also has a significant impact
on Chinese tourists’ behaviors of Seichi Junrei marking.
• The tourist who has been Enoshima many times
The Second recorder is a big fan of many animations and comics. This was not her
ﬁrst time visiting the locations of Slam Dunk; nevertheless, she still wanted to take
pictures on the railway crossing which always appeared in opening theme song (Fig. 4).
She commented with strong emotion, ‘Not every Enoden met Hanamichi Sakuragi (the
main character of Slam Dunk) is the green train’, shows her high request of details in
Seichi Junrei. Diﬀerent with those who were ﬁrst time there, because she had been many
times there, she did not focus on ﬁnding out the exact location but devoting to maximize
reforming the scenes in reality. The diﬀerences of her pictures and comments from
others’ also verify her special request that she wants her path to be separated from
Proposal of Chinese Tourist Support System
483

‘normal’ recordings. However, as she had been there many times, she lost the fresh
feeling and did not record all the scenes marked by prior participants. Because of the
imprecise navigation results to incorrect location mark, and the repetition of re-entering
user name and path name, both aﬀect the entire experience of Seichi Junrei and reduce
her impetus to record. She only recorded typical two scenes that had deep impressed her
and less motivated to record more. As a chance went to Enoshima again, she is absolutely
not just satisﬁed with Slam Dunk tourism. Some landmarks reminded her of the other
two animations that also took Enoshima as a background. Thus she began to enjoy
another Seichi Junrei and continued to make notes in the system after she ﬁnished all
her recording about Slam Dunk. To a certain extent, she was also a pioneering pilgrim
[6] and became the reference to the last participant.

Fig. 4. The second recording

• The tourist who likes Seichi Junrei
The ﬁfth participant has rich experience of Seichi Junrei and has been following
several blogs which updating notes and commendations of holy land trip regularly. He
is familiar with getting information solely from blogs thus we spent a long time to explain
the functions of Whispath, the study cost and switch cost is for experienced pilgrims are
signiﬁcant. What he marked for Slam Dunk is as same as the ﬁrst participant did. He
commented of the gate is ‘I really want to see the school’s basketball stadium, whether
it is the same as that in the comic.’ But Kamakura high school prohibits entry of trav‐
ellers, thus we can see that even though his comment is under the picture of the school’s
gate, it is actually related to the gym, and none of other participants ever mentioned that.
Without other referencing contents of Slam Dunk for him to explore, he found the third
participant’s sharing of Taritari and Tsuritama, and decided to follow her. He also
experienced imprecise navigation issue, resulting in incorrect locating information of
his marks (Fig. 5). It is clearly to see that his photos are deviated from the third partic‐
ipant’s marks nevertheless they recorded at the same location.
Fig. 5. The ﬁfth recording
To the tourist who has never been to Enoshima, she could find out the scenes by
utilizing the supporting system. It combined the image with the location information rather
than a mere description of the location. Media and film provide a wealth of real or imag‐
ined meaning to signify the attraction of a place where is made to be more attractive,
through constructing or reinforcing particular images of those places, and acting as
‘markers’ [10, 11]. From the details of Table 1, one can easily identifies the railway
crossing and Kamakura high school are the only two locations that have been taken photos
or recorded texts by all participants. They considered these two places as main elements
of the animation that appeared too many times in the animation. The first participant told
that she could recall plenty of scenarios while seeing the typical two places. Thus these two
Proposal of Chinese Tourist Support System
485

places are the most emotional for people-place bonding. The other explanation attributes
to the influence of media. Contents tourism is of particular use in an age of ‘multi-use’ or
the ‘media mix’ [9]. Yamamura summarized three periods. The first is in the 1990s, when
multi-use started to grow among comics, animations and games; second is in early 2000s
when internet assisted spreading digital production and sharing contents to the mass [8].
These two locations are the most commented, reviewed and forwarded Slam Dunk topics
on Chinese media. The supporting system provided both comic scenes and real photos as
a consultation. As the combination of virtual world and real world, the participant could
recognize the scenes easily.
Table 1. Location details
• The problems occurred in Whispath
However, it is also obviously that there are many problems in Whispath when it is
used in Chinese holy land pilgrimage. The ﬁrst one is that the system, especially it is in
English and Japanese, confused some participants. Since we explained a lot about how
to utilize it, some Chinese subject has felt upset and bother. Second, since Whispath
needs to re-enter user name and path name when users want to update a photo or
comment, it gives the bad inﬂuence to the experience of Chinese Seichi Junrei, and
reduces the motivation of recording. Even some users miss-spelled the path name, it
results the records were separated. Third, the imprecise navigation has to be ﬁxed;
otherwise the supporting system could not have eﬀectiveness because of the incorrect
location mark.

Conclusion
This paper introduced the Japanese pop culture’s inﬂuence to young Chinese tourists,
and clarify Weibo can motivate them to participate Seichi Junrei. There is substantial
evidence, expanded in this paper, which the great potential of Seichi Junrei in Chinese
tourism market and the deﬁciency of a Chinese Seichi Junrei tool. We clariﬁed the
concept of the proposed media tool. We also identify issues from the result if the experi‐
ment of Chinese holy land trip.
486
N. Zhang and K. Ogawa

According to the experiment of Chinese young pilgrims by utilizing the supporting
system, we analyzed their behavior and found the some eﬀectiveness and problems of
the system, which is based on Whispath. The combination of image and location infor‐
mation could help Chinese tourists recognize the scenes more easily and provide them
many references of Seichi Junrei from other previous recorders. However, the imprecise
navigation and re-typing also has great negative impact on their entire experience and
recording desire.
Enlarging the experiment, there are several promising avenues for further research.
We must ﬁx the problems that inﬂuence the experience of Chinese holy land pilgrimage.
And if it is possible to receive copyright authorization of certain work and sends original
pictures to travellers automatically when they approaching a location, we also want to
test it would help travellers to match the virtual with the actual or not. For those Chinese
fans that lack of Japanese oﬃcial information channel, If Japanese works related Weibo
API could be used in our record system, we wonder users would be motivated to ﬁnd
out more actual scenes in their memories or not. In addition, in order to make system
user-friendlier to Chinese, it is necessary to keep on working on the user interface. A
simple user interface in Chinese is necessary. Moreover, it should make more Chinese
tourists to test the system and adjust the design is ok or not.

Abstract. Computer-based simulations of pedestrian dynamics are
aimed at improving the walkability of urban crowded scenarios, con-
sidering the pedestrians’ comfort and safety. The validation of the devel-
oped models requires a cross-disciplinary approach, and the acquisition
of empirical evidences about human behavior is mandatory. The main
purpose of this work is to report two case studies which allowed to per-
form simulations and validate the ELIAS38 agent-based computational
model: (i) the naturalistic observation of pedestrian dynamics in an
urban commercial-touristic walkway, focused on the impact of group-
ing and ageing on speed; (ii) the controlled experiment of pedestrian
spatial behavior, focused on the impact of speed and cultural diﬀerences
on personal space.

Introduction
Progressive urbanization is a global tendency and it is estimated that by 2025
the 58 % of the world population will live in large urban agglomerates [17]. Many
cities around the world are developing advanced and integrated solutions com-
prising sustainable mobility strategies to meet the citizens’ needs and to increase
their quality of life [25]. Facing this trend, advanced urban planning activities
are shifting toward a focus on walkability, namely how conducive and friendly the
urban environment is for walking (e.g., quality of sidewalks, route navigation,
pedestrian-vehicular interaction) [1]. Moreover, the European Charter of Pedes-
trians’ Rights1 (1988) highlighted the need to ensure the comfort and safety
of pedestrians in urban areas, including the elderlies and people with impaired
mobility (i.e. pedestrian-friendly cities).

The evaluation of the walkability degree of urban areas requires the involve-
ment of many actors, skills, and disciplines, in a global scenario: the strategic
and practical solutions which will emerge will be not just a mere sum of pieces
of knowledge, and only cross-disciplinary attitudes in the creation of innovative
approaches will increase the possibility to succeed for the future of our style of
life in the cities (e.g., urban planning, traﬃc engineering, health science, social
science, computer science).
Within this scenario, the role of advanced computer-based systems for the
simulation of the dynamical behavior of pedestrians [11] is becoming a consoli-
dated and successful ﬁeld of research and application, thanks to the possibility to
test the eﬃcacy of alternative spatial layouts focusing on pedestrian dynamics
and walkability assessment. The development of validated and realistic simu-
lation systems also requires a cross-disciplinary approach, involving not only
heterogeneous knowledge to be incorporated in the computational models, but
also diverse methodological approaches to collect, validate and test the model
itself and the related simulation results in order to support at best decision
makers and planners.
The main purpose of this paper is to introduce some results of a cross-
disciplinary methodological framework aimed at collecting empirical data about
human locomotion and spatial behavior through naturalistic observations (in
vivo), controlled experiments (in vitro) and agent-based simulations (in silico).
This methodological framework contributes to the study of walkability through
the theoretical deﬁnition and the empirical study of three main factors which
drive pedestrian behavior in terms of speed proﬁles and stress-response to den-
sity in urban crowded scenarios: group-driven, age-driven and cultural-driven
pedestrian behavior.
Section 2 brieﬂy introduces such factors as distinctive of the proposed app-
roach, while the proposed methodology is presented in Sect. 3, with reference
to the design and execution of naturalistic observations and controlled experi-
ments, providing data to feed the agent-based simulation system ELIAS38 [2].
Case studies are presented in Sect. 4, focusing on the empirical investigation of
the impact of grouping, ageing and cross-cultural diﬀerences on pedestrian loco-
motion and spatial behavior. Final remarks about results and their employment
for assessing the quality of simulation results (heterogenous group and age-driven
speed proﬁles), as well as ongoing works about the assessment of walkability in
urban critical scenarios are presented in Sect. 5.

Modeling Group, Age and Cultural-Driven
Pedestrian Behavior
The development of computer-based models and systems to simulate the dynam-
ical behavior of crowds and pedestrians is challenged in facing three main fac-
tors characterizing the reality of the collective walking: groups, age and culture.
Speed proﬁles and stress-response to density in urban crowded scenarios highly
depend on these factors, contributing to the deﬁnition of assessment issues for
walkability.

• Group-driven pedestrian behavior: recent empirical contributions [13,22]
clearly showed that pedestrian ﬂows in urban crowded scenarios are charac-
terized by the preponderant presence of groups, with the prevalence of dyads
in the related granulometric distribution. This phenomenon is largely deter-
mined by the motivation by which people are gathered or move through a
certain environment, and/or by the type of event they are participating to
[6]. For example, train stations are mainly characterized by the presence of
fast moving single commuters, while other collective venues are more often
characterized by the presence of informal and/or structured groups of visi-
tors, generally moving slower than the former type of pedestrian. Analyses
of pedestrian dynamics not considering the impact of groups have a reduced
accuracy, since grouping was found to negatively impact ﬂow rate, speed and
evacuation time [30]. This is due to the diﬃculty of group members in coor-
dinating their movement depending on (i) the environmental level of density
[7,21], (ii) the need to maintain spatial cohesion to communicate while walk-
ing (i.e. proxemic behavior) [15] and (iii) the urgency to evacuate together in
case of emergency (i.e. aﬃliative behavior) [20].
• Age-driven
pedestrian
behavior: the notion of Age-friendly Cities,
introduced by the World Health Organization [24], oﬀers a framework for the
development of urban contexts encouraging inclusion and active ageing of the
citizens. It contains guidelines and policies for assess and increase the accessi-
bility of urban facilities and services for the elderly. Moreover, the mobility of
aged people is a key factor for maintaining an active and productive status,
in spite of the progressive decline of cognitive and locomotion skills linked
to ageing [27]. Compared to adult pedestrians, elderlies are characterized by
lower speed and larger interpersonal distances while walking. This is strongly
conditioned by the progressive decline in the operation of (i) perceptive sen-
sors (e.g. limited perception of light and colors) and (ii) locomotor-cognitive
skills (e.g., reduced range of motion, loss of muscle strength and coordination,
changes in posture, diminished attention and reaction time, spatial disorienta-
tion) [31]. All these bodily changes lead to a subjective perception of physical
vulnerability and a sense of fragility at the psychological level [32]. This is the
reason why aged people are more provident in the space, and they move more
slowly keeping more space around themselves.
• Culture-driven pedestrian behavior: social and spatial interactions of
pedestrians in urban crowded scenarios depend on several socio-psychological
factors related to the variability among subjects’ culture (i.e. crowd proﬁling)
[6]. In particular, cross-cultural diﬀerences has an impact on human response
to the physical condition of density by itself. The need of optimal recipro-
cal distances with other people is driven by psychological factors and social
norms related to the notion of personal space [16]: the area immediately sur-
rounding individuals, into which strangers cannot intrude without arousing
discomfort and stress (i.e. crowding) [4]. In high-contact cultures (e.g., the
Mediterranean, Arabic, Hispanic cultures) people exhibit closer distances com-
pared to no-contact cultures (e.g., Northern European, Caucasian American
cultures) [15]. The Japanese culture is characterized by a scarce acceptance for

494
S. Bandini et al.
spatial proximity during face to face social interaction, but an high tolerance
for spatial intrusion in situation of high density in public spaces [19]. Lastly,
the intensity of sensory inputs and physical contact in high density situations
can be labeled either positively or negatively, depending on contexts of social
interaction [26].

Methodological Framework
As previously mentioned, providing methodological and technological supports
to decision makers through new generations of simulation systems for walkability
assessment means providing realistic models and accurate data collection. The
here proposed approach is based on the integration of data collection method-
ologies from social sciences through naturalistic observations and experiments
of pedestrians’ behavior (i.e. analysis), and the related activity of agent-based
modeling and simulation of pedestrians dynamics (i.e. synthesis) [3].
3.1
In Vivo Observation
Unobtrusive naturalistic observations, in vivo (from Latin, living), allow to col-
lect empirical data about pedestrians’ behavior, considering the physical and
social features of the environment in which the subjects are situated (subjects
are not aware to be observed, the observer does not intrude the stage) [10]. This
method is characterized by the possibility to exert a limited amount of con-
trol over the environment, but by an higher possibility to generalize results (i.e.
external validity) [12].
Design and perform naturalistic observations in urban scenarios requires to
systematically consider several practical elements (e.g., features of the scenario,
duration time, staﬀmembers, equipment for data collection, authorization, eth-
ical restrictions). In particular, the issue about the privacy of the people partici-
pating the study represents a crucial aspect, due to the diﬃculty to obtain their
informed consent beforehand [33].
The information collected during the survey (e.g., notes, video footages) are
analyzed by using quantitate techniques and statistics, focused on the occurrence
and modalities of speciﬁc behavioral indicators (e.g., level of density, trajectories,
speed, grouping, pedestrian proﬁling, habits). It is also highly recommended to
cross-check results by means of two or more observers, who analyze data by using
a shared taxonomy for the deﬁnition of the observed phenomenon.
3.2
In Vitro Experiment
Controlled experiments, in vitro (test tube), allow to systematically measure the
impact of a manipulated stimulus event (i.e. independent variable) on pedestri-
ans’ behavior (e.g., crowding stress reaction to density, speed, spatial behavior)
[10]. Contrary to naturalistic observations, experiments are performed in lab-
oratory settings in order to exert the maximum amount of control over the

Crossing Disciplinary Borders Through Studying Walkability
495
environment (i.e. internal validity). The most critical aspect is the limited pos-
sibility to extend the results achieved in an artiﬁcial setting to natural contexts,
considering also that the merely presence of the experimenter has an impact on
subjects’ behavior in terms of performance and social interaction (i.e. Hawthorne
eﬀect) [10].
Experiments are aimed at verifying the validity of a priori hypotheses by
means of standard and replicable procedures, typically following the protocol of
clinical trials [12]: participants are randomly assigned to the treatment condition
or control condition (no treatment), in order to compare results (i.e. between sub-
jects). Alternatively, all participants are assigned to the treatment condition, in
order to compare results among pre-test and post-test measurements (i.e. within
subjects). Since experiments on human behavior potentially includes stressful or
harmful factors related to the procedure by itself, it is required to obtain the
authorization of the ethic committee of the institution that promotes the survey
and the informed consent of participants [33].
3.3
In Silico Simulation
Although there are some objections about the simpliﬁed level of correspon-
dence between computer-based simulations and complex social systems [11], this
methodology, in silico (on the computer) allows to envision those phenomena
that are diﬃcult to be directly observed in real scenarios, testing alternative
conditions and courses of action (i.e. what-if scenarios). The issue of deﬁning
formal computational models about pedestrian dynamics has been tackled from
diﬀerent perspectives:
– Physical approach [18] represents pedestrians as particles subject to forces
(e.g., attraction and repulsive forces), in analogy with ﬂuid dynamics;
– Cellular Automata approach [23] represents pedestrians as occupied states of
the cells. Pedestrian interactions are based on the ﬂoor ﬁeld method: a virtual
traces that inﬂuence pedestrian transitions and movements;
– Agent-based
approach
[8]
represents
pedestrians
as
heterogeneous,
autonomous and situated entities moving according to behavioral rules and
speciﬁcations.
ELIAS38 (the name is in memory of Elias Canetti [5] who studied the behav-
ior of crowd for thirty-eight years) is an agent-based simulation systems whose
core computational model allows the explicit representation of groups of agents,
interacting through proxemics rules [2,3]. Agents are characterized by (i) per-
ceptive and behavioral speciﬁcations (e.g., perceive and avoid obstacles, follow
paths, perceive other agents) and the (ii) capability to communicate in order
to achieve some individual or shared goals (e.g., every group is driven by the
tendency to maintain spatial cohesion during locomotion). Data coming from
the quantitative analysis of in vivo and in vitro studies allow the calibration
and the validation of the simulation tool, in order to apply analytical tools (e.g.,
Fruin’s Walkway Level of Service Criteria (LOS) metrics [9]) on what-if sessions

496
S. Bandini et al.
at diﬀerent conditions. Within this computational framework, it is possible to
perform walkability assessments in terms of the above-mentioned speed proﬁles
and stress-response to density in presence of groups, heterogeneous ages and
cultural proxemics speciﬁcations.

Case Studies
This Section presents two empirical studies based on (i) the observation of small
size group behavior (i.e. dyads) walking in situation of irregular density, con-
sidering also the impact of age, (ii) the experimental investigation of personal
space in dynamics setting.
4.1
Observation of Pedestrian Circulation Dynamics
The survey was performed on November 24th 2012, and it consisted of the unob-
trusive video-recorded observation of pedestrian circulation dynamics at the
Vittorio Emanuele II gallery (Milan, Italy). The gallery is a popular touristic-
commercial walkway, exclusively intended for pedestrians and characterized by
heterogeneous pedestrian proﬁles (tourists, shoppers, strollers and inhabitants)
and group granulometric distribution [13].
Data analysis was focused on estimating the environmental level of density
and the speed of a sample of singletons and dyads composed of adult and elderly
pedestrians. The detection of dyads and elderly pedestrians (approximately 70
y.o.) was supported by an ad hoc designed checklist, comprising a set of loco-
motion, communication and physical indicators. No.62 pedestrians were tracked
by using the open source software Tracker Video Analysis and Modelling Tool
(www.cabrillo.edu).
Level of Density. The average level of density was 0.22 people/squared meter.
The average ﬂow rate was 7.78 pedestrian/minute/meter. Results (see Fig. 1)
were compared according to the Walkway Level of Service Criteria (LOS) [9]: a
range of values that standardly describe the impact of contextual situations of
density on pedestrian circulation dynamics (from LOS A-pedestrian free ﬂow, to
LOS F-extremely diﬃculty in walking movements). The average level of density
and ﬂow rate corresponded to LOS B, that is associated with minor conﬂicts
under low-medium density condition.
Speed and Trajectories. The sample2 was composed of: 15 adult singles (AS),
16 adult dyad members (AD), 15 elderly singles (ES), 16 elderly dyad members
(ED). Results about speed and trajectories are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1.
2 60 % single males and 40 % single females. 25 % male-male dyads, 25 % female-female
dyads, 50 % mixed gender. 58 % pedestrians from South to North, 42 % from North
to South. Pedestrians who stopped were not tracked, as well as mixed age dyads.

A two-factor analysis of variance3 showed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect for the
group factor on speed [F(1,58) = 28.61, p < 0.0001], and a signiﬁcant main
eﬀect for the age factor on speed [F(1,58) = 105.97, p < 0.0001]. Finally, results
showed that the interaction between the group and age factors on speed was
signiﬁcant [F(1,58) = 13.58, p < 0.001]. A series of independent-samples t-tests
showed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the speed of: AS and AD, t(29) = 2.05,
p < 0.0001; AS and ES, t(28) = 2.05, p < 0.0001; AS and ED, t(29) = 2.05,
p < 0.0001; AD and ES, t(29) = 2.05, p < 0.001; AD and ED t(30) = 2.04, p <
0.0001. There was not a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the walking speed of ES
and ED, t(29) = 2.05, p = 0.21.
Results showed that at LOS B dyads walked 30 % slower than singles, and
that elderly walked 40 % slower than adults. Further analysis showed that pedes-
trians’ trajectories, gender and direction of movements had no signiﬁcant eﬀect
on speed.
4.2
Experiment of Pedestrian Personal Space
The experiment was performed on June 8th 2013, at Research Center for Advance
Science and Technology-RCAST of The University of Tokyo (Japan) [14]. It was
aimed at measuring personal space in static and dynamic settings, taking into
account the impact of speed and cross-cultural diﬀerences. In particular, the
front zone of pedestrian personal space was assumed to be larger than the one
in static settings and linearly speed-dependent. This is due to the need of an
additional margin projected towards the direction of movement to anticipate
the spatial intrusion of oncoming pedestrians.
The sample was composed of No.20 male subjects (from 18 to 25 y.o., with
suﬃcient visual capacity, 17 Japanese, 2 Vietnamese and 1 Chinese). The sub-
ject’s state of movement and speed were deﬁned as independent variables. The
size of personal space was deduced from the eﬀects of discomfort caused by

spatial invasion. The experiments comprised three procedures performed within
subjects (see Fig. 3):
(A) Stop-distance procedure (static setting): participant had to stop the app-
roach of the confederate (who walked straight from a distance of 5 m), when
he felt uncomfortable about spatial nearness; the distance between them was
measured as the size of the front zone of participant’s personal space;
(B) Approach-distance procedure (dynamic setting): participant walked towards
the stationary confederate and stopped the approach when he felt uncomfort-
able;
(C) Locomotion-distance procedure (dynamic setting): participants walked
towards the oncoming confederate and stopped the approach when he felt
uncomfortable (the confederate had to stop immediately after).
Each procedure was repeated three times according to the modalities of the
variable speed (low, medium, high speed). Participants were asked to walk fol-
lowing foot markers drawn on the ﬂoor, and to synchronize their gait to digital-
metronome background sounds: low speed (70 bpm, 0.93 m/s), medium speed
(90 bpm, 1.23 m/s), high speed (110 bpm, 1.46 m/s). Results are presented in
Fig. 4 and Table 2.

Stop-Distance. A one-factor analysis of variance showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect for
the speed factor on subjects’ personal space when approached by the confederate
[F(1,57) = 5.32, p < 0.01]. A series of two-tails paired-samples t-tests showed
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the size of personal space at low and medium
speed approach, t(19) = 2.86, p < 0.01; low and high speed approach, t(19) =
2.86, p < 0.001. There was not a signiﬁcant diﬀerence comparing medium and
high speed approach, t(19) = 2.86, p = 0.79. In conclusion, results showed that
the size of the front zone of subjects’ personal space in static settings is aﬀected
by walking speed of the approaching confederate.
Approach-Distance. A one-factor analysis of variance showed no signiﬁcant
eﬀect for the speed factor on subjects’ personal space when approaching the static
confederate [F(1,57) = 4.99, p = 0.89]. A series of two-tails paired-samples t-tests
showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between results and the size of personal space
in static setting (stop-distance procedure at low speed). In conclusion, results
showed that the size of the front zone of subjects’ personal space when moving
towards a stationary person is not aﬀected by speed, and it is similar to personal
space in static situations.
Locomotion-Distance. A one-factor analysis of variance showed a slight sig-
niﬁcant eﬀect for the speed factor on subjects’ personal space when approaching
the oncoming confederate [F(1,57) = 4.99, p = 0.0154]. A series of two-tails
paired-samples t-tests showed a slight signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the size of
personal space at low and high speed reciprocal approach, t(19) = 2.86, p =
0.011; medium and high speed approach, t(19) = 2.86, p < 0.01. There was not
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence comparing low and medium speed reciprocal approach,
t(19) = 2.86, p = 0.60. A two-tails paired-samples t-test showed a slight signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence between personal space in dynamic setting (high speed reciprocal

approach) and personal space in static setting (stop-distance procedure at low
speed), t(19) = 2.86, p < 0.05. In conclusion, results showed that the size of the
front zone of subjects’ personal space when approaching the oncoming confed-
erate is aﬀected by speed and that it is larger than the one in static settings.
Comparing the Impact of Speed. A linear regression was conducted to test
the eﬀect of speed on personal space among A, B and C procedures, which was
signiﬁcant [F(1,179) = 8.62, p < 0.01]. Results demonstrated that the size of the
front zone of personal space is linearly speed-dependent, considering both static
and dynamic settings.

Final Remarks
The current work has proposed a cross-disciplinary methodology for studying
pedestrian locomotion and spatial behavior by means of empirical investigations
and pedestrian computer-based simulations to support walkability assessments.
The ﬁrst case study was aimed at testing the impact of grouping and ageing
on pedestrian behavior in an urban crowded scenario. Results showed that in
situation of irregular ﬂows age signiﬁcantly reduced the speed due to locomotion
skills decrease, and that dyads walked much slower than singles due to the need
to maintain spatial cohesion to communicate.
The second case study was based on the experimental investigation of pedes-
trian personal space, taking into account the impact of speed and cross-cultural
diﬀerences. Results showed that the front zone of pedestrian personal space is
larger then the one in static settings (low speed approach), and that its size
is linear speed-dependent. Considering the socio-demographic characteristics of
participants (almost Japanese male students), results conﬁrmed that static per-
sonal space in Japanese culture is larger than Caucasian-American culture [16].
According to the proposed methodological approach (see Sect. 3), a simula-
tion campaign was executed to test the eﬃcacy of the computational model incor-
porated in ELIAS38 in representing group-driven heterogenous speed proﬁles at
irregular condition of density, comparing results with the gathered empirical data
[2]. Results showed that the model is consistent with the collected empirical data,
representing a promising step for the improvement of the tool. In particular, the
model has been able to reproduce results similar to single pedestrians’ speed, but
it showed a decrease in the velocity of group members lower than the observed
one. However, the achieved results must be evaluated considering the adopted
model conﬁguration: all the agents have the same desired speed (1.30 m/s). This
is based on the empirically observed velocity of pedestrians traveling for business
purpose in an airport terminal [28], which is diﬀerent from the leisure scenario
observed at the gallery.
At this stage, the software has been already employed towards the simulation
of real case scenarios, supporting the design of practical solutions for managing
pedestrian circulation dynamics in urban contexts (e.g., designing the spatial
layout of organized queue areas and access ramps in public transport stations).
In conclusion, the presented cross-disciplinary approach could be of notable
interest for those attempting to properly plan and design the spatial layout of
urban environments to enhance pedestrian mobility and walkability. On-going
works are aimed at: (i) calibrating agents’ speed according to the features of
diﬀerent simulated scenarios, as well as age-driven desired speed [29]; (ii) deﬁn-
ing a proximity-based measure of density relying on the notion of pedestrian
personal space and collision avoidance dynamics; (iii) assessing the walkability
of a critical area in the city of Milan, characterized by the massive presence of
elderly inhabitants and pedestrian-car risky interactions.

Abstract. The rapid development of China urbanization and smart trans-
portation has promoted the optimized environment design research of Chinese
railway station, while earlier rapidity construction and changing commerce
operation based on original railway station have posed various contradictions of
function, business and culture. This paper aims at proposing optimized envi-
ronment design solutions based on pedestrian simulation as exempliﬁed Nanjing
South Railway Station, which is the largest railway junction station in Asia. In
this paper, simulation experiment of passenger trafﬁc is implemented to diag-
nose environmental problems, which is based on passengers’ behavioral pat-
terns. Then, ﬁve kinds of optimized design solutions are proposed pointedly
according to quantized conclusion of the simulation. In addition, a special
‘Optimized Simulation Sample’ System (a.k.a. OSS) of passenger trafﬁc is
established, for evaluating whether expected effects have been realized by using
the framework of AnyLogic 7.0. In the end, the optimized environment
designing is implemented based on pedestrian simulation. In this way, the
existing environment problems of railway station can be identiﬁed precisely and
optimized design solutions can be more effective.

Introduction
The rapid development of China urbanization and smart transportation has promoted
the optimized environment design research of Chinese railway station. The railway
station displays regional culture as a city landmark, while earlier rapidity construction
and commerce operation based on original railway station have posed various con-
tradictions, which need to be solved urgently. Most of environment design research
was related to passenger sensory experience rather than behavioral data analysis, which
leads to the ignorance of passengers’ potential demands.
Under the circumstances, the optimized environment designing project of Nanjing
South Railway Station, which is the largest railway junction station in Asia, is com-
missioned to our design team by Shanghai Railway Bureau of China, for solving the

existing environment problems and improving passengers’ experience on the waiting
ﬂoor based on analysis of pedestrian simulation, which is one most effective ways to
establish the scientiﬁc relationship between human behavior and environmental space
of railway station.
The location of Nanjing is in the conﬂuence of the Yangtze River and
Beijing-Shanghai railway (Fig. 1). Nanjing South Railway Station connects ﬁve
high-grade railway lines as the national principal railway station. And its location is on
the main axis of Nanjing city (Fig. 2). The gross area of Nanjing South Railway Station
is approximately 458000 m2, the daily passengers trafﬁc is more than a hundred
thousand passengers. It has been operated in 2011.

Diagnosis of Environmental Problems
2.1
Passengers’ Behavioral Patterns in Key Periods
A database of 250 passengers’ behaviors based on on-site observing and video tracking
is quantiﬁed for recording their behavioral patterns and active time. The conclusion
consists of three parts:
(1) Duration of stay. 10 % of passengers stay within 15 min. 32 % of passengers stay
between 15 and 30 min. 44 % of passengers stay between 30 min and 1 h. 14 %
of passengers stay more than 1 h (Fig. 3).
(2) Behavioral pattern. 46 % of passengers are only waiting for the trains. 24 % of
passengers have a meal before getting on trains. 13 % of passengers are shopping
during the waiting. 7 % of passengers consult information from the staff or service
facilities. 6 % of passengers need necessary service, including travel help for
disabled passengers, care services for maternal and child and emergency care of
elderly passengers. 2 % of passengers store their luggage. 2 % of passengers have
other behaviors (Fig. 4).
(3) Passengers’ behavioral patterns in key periods. Passengers who stayed within
15 min are just waiting for the trains. Passengers who stayed between 15 and
30 min have a meal. Passengers who stayed between 30 min and 1 h have a meal

and go shopping. Passengers who stayed more than 1 h need to store luggage,
station services, or querying besides above-mentioned behavior patterns (Fig. 5).
2.2
Simulation Experiment of Passenger Trafﬁc
The simulation experiment of passenger trafﬁc is set at 30 min and 1 h, because 86 %
of passengers stay within 1 h. Meanwhile, for providing a necessary foundation for
experimental analysis, our team establish environmental base map according to func-
tional zones, facilities distribution and detailed dimension of waiting ﬂoor. Then,
passengers’ trafﬁc density and active chain is simulated by using the framework of
AnyLogic 7.0. Analytical drawings are shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

The conclusions are as follows: The blue zones on the outer edge represent less
passenger trafﬁc. The green zones at the center of ﬂoor mean steady trafﬁc. The yellow
zones in the front and the middle of waiting ﬂoor indicate concentrated passenger
trafﬁc. The red zones at the center axis and waiting zone mean congested trafﬁc.
2.3
Simulation Sample System of Passenger Trafﬁc
For obtaining quantized conclusion of the simulation experiment, a special ‘Simulation
Sample System of Passenger Trafﬁc’ is established. The procedure is divided into three
steps:
(1) Selecting simulation samples. To choose 7 key locations in the environmental
base map as the target samples such as the front of center axis, the middle of
center axis, both sides of center axis, north store zone, south store zone, waiting
zone for VIP and special passengers and the bottom of center axis.
(2) Analyzing the changes of passengers’ trafﬁc density and comparing trafﬁc density
of these samples at 30 min and 1 h.
(3) Establishing simulation sample system of passenger trafﬁc. The quantized con-
clusions are as follows: The trafﬁc in the front of center axis is very congested.
The trafﬁc in the middle of center axis is crowded. Both sides of center axis have
huge vertical trafﬁc. The north store zone is lack of shopping passengers. The
south store zone has appropriate density. The trafﬁc of the waiting zone for VIP
and special passengers occur the route intersection with revenue passenger. The
passengers at the bottom of center axis stay for a while (shown in Table 1).

2.4
Analysis of Environmental Problems
The environmental problems on the waiting ﬂoor of Nanjing South Railway Station
contain ﬁve parts according to simulation conclusion:
(1) The location of the waiting zone for VIP and special passengers is unrea-
sonable (Fig. 8: Blue zones). The routes of different passengers, including rev-
enue passengers and VIP and special passengers interfere with each other. The
special passengers’ route is not convenient and VIP passengers are lack of
privacy.
(2) The number of inquiry desk is not enough and its functions need to be
separated. It only has one inquiry desk in the middle of center axis to take three
functions such as enquiry, service and medical aid. Its utilization rate cannot
satisfy passengers’ requirements due to the over long route (Fig. 8: Red zone).

(3) Service facilities need to be improved. The shortage of information equipments
cause passengers waiting for a long time. Baggage deposit at the bottom of center
axis is too far (Fig. 8: Green zones). And public facilities for children are missing.
(4) Scattered shops are lack of uniﬁed design (Fig. 8: Yellow zones). The business
of stores is unsatisfactory except food shops, especially in north store zone
because its location is far away from waiting zone.
(5) Local culture characteristics are not obvious. Passengers have no idea which
city they stay and what is the spirit of this station.

Optimized Design Solutions
3.1
Separation of Different Passengers
In order to shorten distance and avoiding interference, the waiting zone for VIP and
special passengers is removed to east side of entrance so that their route can be
separated from revenue passengers (Fig. 9: Blue zone).And the waiting zone for rev-
enue passengers is arranged symmetrically in both sides of center axis (Fig. 9: Gray
zones).
3.2
Improvement of Center Zone
For emphasizing central axis and creating space sequence, a center zone is established
along with the central axis of waiting ﬂoor, which is arranged multiple space nodes,
including inquiry desk, service center, cultural display and characteristic landscape
(Fig. 9: Red zones). The inquiry desks in both ends of center zone are the start and end

of space nodes. The service center in the midpoint is the primary space node. The
cultural display between inquiry desks and service center, combined with characteristic
landscape, is secondary space node (shown in Table 2).

3.3
Addition of Service Facilities
Two service facilities zones are established in both sides of entrance (Fig. 9: Green
zones) in order to integrate these functions of baggage deposit, information query and
cash withdrawal, etc. In addition, for providing medical emergency, a medical aid
station is arranged in the west side of center axis. Public facilities for children and the
disabled are added in public lavatory and waiting zone for special passengers.
3.4
Redesign of Store Zone
For avoiding interference of shopping route, service route and sightseeing route.
Four-row store zone is uniﬁed designed in both sides of center axis to sell foods,
magazines, costumes and digital products near the waiting zone for revenue passengers
(Fig. 9: Yellow zones). Then, food shops are removed to the west side of the entrance
so as to meet passengers’ dining requirements in a shortest route. In addition, the
enclosed north stores are replaced by open type stores to attract more passengers.
3.5
Promotion of Regional Culture
The regional culture is inherited and remodeled. The center axis is the emblem of main
axis in Nanjing city. Many unique structure elements in traditional Chinese architecture
are used such as Tianjing, Dougong and Louchuang, etc.
Study on the regional culture elements of south Jiangsu. The circle portal of inquiry
wall is printed by Pixie pattern, which is the emblem of Nanjing city. The lamps in
cultural booths are printed by plum pattern, which is the ﬂower of Nanjing city. The
ceramic store applies symbolic architectures of South Jiangsu to demonstrate charac-
teristic topics.

Evaluation of Optimized Environment Designing
4.1
Optimized Simulation Experiment
For determining the optimized expected effects have been intuitively realized, the
optimized simulation experiment of passenger trafﬁc is also set at 30 min and 1 h by
using AnyLogic 7.0. And analytical drawings are shown in Figs. 10 and 11.
Comparing optimized trafﬁc density with present situation, the optimized conclu-
sions of simulation experiment are as follows: The blue zones reduce in a small range,
especially at the bottom of waiting ﬂoor. It means that the passenger trafﬁc of north
stores is improved. The proportion of green zones is increased signiﬁcantly so as to
most of passenger trafﬁc is evenly distributed. The decreased yellow zones in the
middle of waiting ﬂoor show that passengers’ partition is very effective. The area of red
zones has a huge decrease so that congestion situation is improved properly.

4.2
Optimized Simulation Sample System
For obtaining quantized conclusion of optimized simulation, a special ‘Optimized
Simulation Sample’ system (a.k.a. OSS) of passenger trafﬁc is established. All the
target samples are the same as before. The result comes out after comparing the

improvement of optimized trafﬁc density at 30 min and 1 h: The trafﬁc in the front of
center axis is effectively separated. The congestion in the middle of center axis is
improved signiﬁcantly. The trafﬁc of the waiting zone for revenue passengers is evenly
distributed. The shopping trafﬁc of north store zone is increasing. The trafﬁc of the
waiting zone for VIP and special passengers has appropriate density. Both sides of
center axis have steady shopping passengers. The trafﬁc at the bottom of center axis is
evenly distributed (shown in Table 3).

Implementation of Optimized Environment Designing
Our design team conﬁrms that the above-mentioned ﬁve design solutions are very
effective to solve these contradictions of function, business and culture on the waiting
ﬂoor of Nanjing South Railway Station. And expected effects have been realized based
on optimized simulation outcome. Then, Shanghai Railway Bureau of China passed
our optimized environment designing after three rounds of design presentation, plan
modiﬁcation and achievement demonstration. In the end, the optimized environment
designing is implemented. Finished photos are shown in Table 4.

Conclusion
From the perspective of environment design, this paper aims at proposing optimized
design solutions based on pedestrian simulation as exempliﬁed the waiting ﬂoor of
Nanjing South Railway Station. The purpose of optimized design is to improve the
facilities and functions of Nanjing South Railway Station, and to enhance the city’s
culture characteristics.
Depending on the thought of pedestrian simulation, the simulation experiment of
passenger trafﬁc is implemented to diagnose environmental problems, which is based
on passengers’ behavioral patterns. In addition, a special ‘Optimized Simulation
Sample’ System (a.k.a. OSS) of passenger trafﬁc is established, for evaluating whether
expected effects have been realized. In the end, ﬁve kinds of optimized design solutions
are proposed and implemented according to the quantized conclusion of the simulation.
In this way, pedestrian simulation can provide more effective technical supports for
optimized environment design. Therefore, the existing problems can be identiﬁed
precisely and the optimized design solutions can be pointedly proposed.

Abstract. Researchers and city visionaries have focused a lot of attention on the
“smart” city of the future. In this paper, we propose a qualitative research meth‐
odology that grounds the proposed future city in the actual experiences and
expectations of these cities’ most rapidly-growing population group: Millennials,
or those currently between the ages of 18 and 35. Based on our ﬁndings, we
describe several key trends in Millennials’ urban behavior, and link these trends
to developments in urban infrastructure and connectedness. Finally, we use these
trends as the basis for a proposed Networked city, a city characterized by open
information, linked digital and physical infrastructure, and a focus on sociability
and interaction.

Introduction
Today’s cities are radically changing - creating unprecedented change in our lifestyles.
These lifestyle changes, in turn, feed back into how cities evolve. The digital information
era oﬀers new opportunities for connectedness, allowing cities to become more like
intelligent organisms that can make coordinated responses to changing urban conditions
and needs. The cities of the future will indeed be smarter, in the sense that they will
leverage the expanding potential of communications technologies to enhance urban
environment. In his seminal work City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn, designer
and technologist William J. Mitchell described this feedback process as follows:
“[The environment of the city] matters because the emerging civic structures and spatial arrange‐
ments of the digital era will profoundly aﬀect our access to economic opportunities and public
services, the character and content of public discourse, the forms of cultural activity, the inaction
of power, and the experiences that give shape and texture to our daily routines.” [1].
Mitchell argued that understanding the relationship between emerging technologies
and urban design is crucial, as this relationship is one that can be leveraged to build a
city that supports the kind of life its citizens desire.
The promise embodied in Mitchell’s work is what fueled our research. Our goal was
to explore how cities grow and take on new technological and infrastructure changes in

response to their citizens, and how citizens are impacting what sorts of technologies are
becoming widely adopted in their own cities. Cities will especially need to address the
human needs and expectations of an increasingly inﬂuential cohort of residents – the
Millennials, who are the subject of this research.
Millennials are early adopters of new technology. They are also ﬂocking to cities in
increasing numbers.
Our research asked two main questions:
1. What do Millennials expect from cities?
2. What are the characteristics of a city that responds to Millennials’ expectations?
In this paper, we will focus on how Millennials social and civic experiences in cities
are mediated by emerging networked technologies. This focus is just a portion of a much
larger lifestyle observatory project focused on Millennials and urban transformation.
2
Methodology
Our goal was to explore Millennials’ experiences in cities, and we drew on a mixed,
interdisciplinary variety of qualitative methods in order to approach our questions. We
also chose ten global cities as the focal points for our observation. Our project area was
focused on Europe and the Americas, and we deliberately included acknowledged mega-
cities as well cities that are still developing. Our project cities were: Barcelona, Berlin,
Boston, Detroit, Glasgow, Istanbul, Lima, New York City, Paris, and Saõ Paulo. These
cities were chosen because as urban centers they continue to attract Millennials, and
together they oﬀer a multi-faceted perspective on how to adapt and respond to the needs
and expectations of young residents. The motivation behind selecting a diverse
sample of cities, with particular opportunities and challenges, was to glean insights
speciﬁc to the context of one city and also extract ﬁndings that cut across multiple
cities. It is also important to note that although the Millennial experience from city to
city is unique, several common themes and trends emerged.
The research problem involved gaining a deep and experiential understanding of
experiences in these cities. The research methodology combined immersion, visual
ethnography, and extensive semi-structured interviews with Millennial residents and
experts. The Millennial interviews were structured around similar themes: researchers
aimed to sample a variety of opinions on key urban issues, like housing, mobility,
culture, health and civic participation.
In each project city researchers interviewed ten Millennial participants, who were
recruited through a combination of methods - reaching out to the professional network
and social network of the MIT Mobile Experience Lab researchers, contacting Millen‐
nials with inﬂuential blogs, and snowball sampling. To substantiate ﬁndings and insights
from our Millennial interviews, we spoke with thought leaders from diverse ﬁelds,
including urban design and planning, architecture, civic technology, housing, and mobi‐
lity. Visual ethnography then supplied pictures of the research cities, both through the
eyes of participants and through the eyes of immersed researchers.
Observations on Global Urban Millennials’ Social and Civic- Interactions
517

By combining varied research methods, the research team was able to produce a
multi-faceted but deeply grounded picture of how Millennials interact with their urban
environment, and how they would like these interactions to evolve in future.

Results
Our research is organized around speciﬁc trends that reﬂect issues of great importance
to Millennials living in cities. These ﬁndings reveal a gap between emerging behavior
and the traditional opportunities for social connectivity and civic engagement
oﬀered by existing systems. Based on our observations we propose a prototypical
Networked City – a city where urban systems are designed to address the emerging civic
and social behavior and expectations of Millenials. We further outline two critical
aspects of how the Networked City functions: harnessing urban data and enabling social
connections.
3.1
Living Digitally
Millennials live their lives digitally. This sentiment was echoed multiple times by study
participants, regardless of where in the world they live. This expectation has already
wrought big changes in how cities interact with citizens, and the trend shows no sign of
abating. Millennials have become used to constant connectivity, and their mobile
devices are deeply incorporated into how they experience the cities in which they live.
A 23-year-old student in São Paulo, Brazil speaks of her iPhone as if it were a bodily
appendage, revealing how the phone’s aﬀordances shape her interactions with the city
in a method that they controls:
“Both in the gym and in the park, I have music with me. And I always use apps to monitor bodily
functions. I check on myself step by step…”
A Millennial’s City Life is a Never-Ending Combination of the Digital and the
Physical. The expectation of digital interaction with a city does not stop at municipal
authorities, or even with municipal facilities. Everything from organizing a political
protest to ﬁnding a new band to meeting a romantic partner has manifested in the digital
realm. Millennials around the globe expect to interact with the whole of the physical
infrastructure of their cities – from accessing transit schedules and tracking the actual
locations and expected arrival times of buses and metros, to knowing where the nearest
bike-sharing station might be. Millennials have also been shaped by social technology
that enables constant connectedness. Their communities exist both physically and digi‐
tally, and they expect cities to have online spaces where residents can share ideas and
passions that reinforce their physical lives.
3.2
Emerging Online Civic Space
Social media oﬀer spaces where Millennials create and deﬁne themselves, and by exten‐
sion their social spheres and relationships. One of the most striking aspects of
518
S. Dumpawar et al.

Millennials’ use of social media is how it enables new civic possibility in the city. Social
media create a new gathering place for citizens to interact, one that many of our partic‐
ipants reported entering. Sociologist Ray Oldenburg has described the importance of
having urban spaces where people can come together in his book The Great Good Place
(Third Places):
“In order for the city and its neighborhoods to oﬀer the rich and varied association that is their
promise and potential, there must be neutral ground upon which people may gather. There must
be places where individuals may come and go as they please, in which no one is required to play
host, and in which we all feel at home and comfortable.” [2]
These Third Spaces, Oldenburg argues, are spaces between the workplace and an
intimate home, and therefore, allow for a neutrality that is not often aﬀorded to those
other locations. Third Spaces, therefore, oﬀer a unique freedom. [2] Social media, and
more broadly the Internet, have emerged as a powerful space for civic issues in part
because they aren’t associated with any oﬃcial civic authority.
Several young people we spoke with were deeply familiar with using social media
for civic organizing. Some shared their experiences with digitally enabled protest move‐
ments. In Istanbul, Millennials talked about how Facebook had been a central part of
organizing the Gezi Park protest movement, a series of demonstrations across Turkey
in 2013 demanding greater personal and press freedoms. A 29-year-old architecture and
design researcher in Istanbul said:
“as the public space started to become abstract, we started to live that space in social media …
Those [young] people connect more on social media and it aﬀects the way in which that part of
the city changes.”
Her statement suggests a feedback loop that encompasses the lived digital and lived
physical experience. Rather than existing separately, these two spaces are in constant
conversation with each other, and what happens in one aﬀects the other. Sometimes,
these conversations involve the local municipal authority:
“The Kadıköy municipality makes eﬀective use of Twitter. Some of the tweets are really
humorous and young people deﬁnitely respond to that. Some times they interact with the munic‐
ipality just to get a humorous response from them.”
By participating in this feedback loop of conversation, the authorities in the Kadıköy
neighborhood became a rich part of their residents’ emotional lives, possibly even
making the city a more attractive place to live.
Among Millennials in São Paulo, Facebook often entirely substitutes for functions
usually provided by the community or the city, determining relationships, information
and possible participation. This happens so much that the lifestyle of individuals over‐
laps seamlessly with available communication infrastructure in a kind of “reﬂection”
that seems to design and put together a parallel city, a “second city.” One interviewee
suggested the existence of this second city:
“The city hardly oﬀers anything for this [cultural outreach]… [there is] only Facebook, even
when I communicate and advertise my shows. This is the only way to reach people who are
really interested.”
Observations on Global Urban Millennials’ Social and Civic- Interactions

Ubiquitous connectivity in the hands of Millennials is transforming the relationship
between city dwellers and their governments. As Millennials exert greater inﬂuence on
digital channels it shapes the ways in which they perceive the role of civic authorities
in cities, and their own civic responsibilities. This collaboration between civic authori‐
ties and Millennials happens through both informal and formal systems.
The past few years have seen a shift in the way governance at the city level functions.
This shift can be seen in the growing inﬂuence and impact globally of open government
data, a practice in which governments release to the public government data in a
machine-readable and freely accessible format. For many city governments, the goal is
to engage tech-savvy individuals in collaboration with the city to ﬁnd solutions to civic
problems. Through websites such as Challenge.gov, government agencies actively
seek and reward innovative solutions to problems too complex or time consuming
for them to address on their own. Websites such as SeeClickFix make it easier for
citizens to report non-emergency issues in their neighborhoods, encouraging active citi‐
zenship. Apps such as Adopt-a-Hydrant allow citizens to take temporary responsibility
for city infrastructure. “Towards Data Driven Cities,” a study by La Fabrique de la Cité
that puts a spotlight on many such initiatives in American cities, highlights the role urban
data and digital tools can play in collaborative approaches towards governance [3].
What we see more and more is that cities are moving from a top-down approach to
governance to a more collaborative one by supporting practices and approaches that
allow citizens to show more agency and leverage new technologies. According to a
survey by the Pew Research Center, the Millennial age group is much more likely to be
politically active through social media (57 percent use social media to participate in
political activity and conversations) [4]. Organizations such as Code for America place
young technologists and developers at the city government level to improve the ways
cities function. These types of organizations have become key links between young civic
hackers and city governments in the United States. Similar organizations now exist in
many countries around the world.
3.3
The Changing Nature of Ownership (from Physical to Digital)
In addition to migrating social and civic interactions onto a digital landscape, the Internet
and cloud computing have moved many items from the physical to the digital world and
changed the ways in which Millennials understand what it means to own an item. These
changes in ownership patterns have allowed Millennials to more eﬃciency use limited
(and expensive) urban resources like space and transportation.
Compared to previous generations, Millennials’ physical items are more compact
or they exist entirely digitally. This new ownership has serious implications for
housing and community spaces.
A lack of physical presence extends to other physical items that are fast becoming
obsolete. No longer does the Millennial need a drawer in the kitchen to stash a horde of
paper take-out menus, as they all exist within a smartphone app or on a website. Nor do
Millennials typically print out documents or even photos, freeing up the space required
by ﬁle cabinets or large bookshelves. Even the heaviest tomes can be kept on an iPad,
Kindle, or other eReader.
520
S. Dumpawar et al.

As Grace Ehlers of the retail industry website The Robin Report, explains, “Even
owning the latest album of your favorite band feels a lot less appealing when you can
stream it immediately on and oﬄine with a Spotify pro membership, without taking up
any space on your hard drive [5].”
Closets, too, are shrinking as it becomes easier to buy, sell, and rent clothing and
fashion accessories. Millennials are engaging in a new type of material wealth
ecosystem that favors reselling, renting, and reusing physical items. Startups such
Rent the Runway, Le Tote, and Birchbox are major players in changing the way
consumers shop for beauty and fashion items. Birchbox is a beauty product subscription
box service that allows customers to customize what type of products they are interested
in, such as “trendy,” “classic,” or “adventurous.” For $10 a month, Birchbox ships the
customer a box of sample-size beauty products to try out – each specially curated for
the recipient, and requiring no large upfront investment in a product. These services
oﬀer the joy of consumption, without the lingering material artifacts. Rent the Runway
is a clothing service that allows costumers to rent high-fashion dresses for a fraction of
the purchase cost simply by choosing the dress online and then having it shipped. Rent
the Runway addresses two major issues: (1) limited space in urban closets, especially
for formal items that are less frequently worn and (2) the rise of social media, which
means that a picture of a dress can live online eternally in photos. Rent the Runway is
one of several companies that aims to oﬀer Millennials a plethora of choices, without
adding to the physical items they will have to store and move. The existence of these
services feeds back into city infrastructure. Millennials can change residences more
readily because they own fewer things, leading to a greater tolerance for physical tran‐
sience and a greater ability to travel large distances for work or pleasure.
The changing nature of physical space, both as a resource and as an obstacle, leads
Millennials to view the utilization of assets in a distinct way.
3.4
Optimizing Resources with a Human Touch
Millennials do not always view sharing as a purely economic transaction. While sharing
lends itself to more eﬃcient utilization of resources, Millennials also care about the
human dimension of sharing, and appreciate the ability to connect and interact
with strangers in the process of using shared systems in the city. According to a
study by the consulting ﬁrm PricewaterhouseCoopers, trust and a sense of community
contribute to adoption of the sharing economy - a sentiment echoed by some of our
participants. [6] Explaining his motivation for using long-distance ride sharing apps, a
24 year old artist and designer from Detroit noted, “There is deﬁnitely a community and
social aspect to it [ridesharing] … Even if you are driving somewhere, I would rather
be driving there with someone than being alone.” A 24 year old MBA student from Paris
compared the experience of using Uber in Paris and in Boston. He framed his decision-
making process in terms of the kind of relationship he formed with Uber drivers:
“… I use [Uber] in Boston and not in Paris. In Boston I’d say that they are not professional
drivers. In Boston, they are students or people who want to support themselves. In Paris, it is
diﬀerent. In Europe there is regulation that they are trying to impose on the drivers. So, they will
be professionals and you don’t form the same relationship. So, it is not the same.”
Observations on Global Urban Millennials’ Social and Civic- Interactions
521

These comments illustrate that mobility for Millennials transcends the purely phys‐
ical provision of “transit” or “transport” to include social and digital components, and
is deﬁned by access and experience rather than ownership. Rather than creating new
hard physical assets, governments should focus on optimizing and maximizing the
use of existing assets. Such an approach can turn disconnected parts of the city into
accessible resources, without requiring the heavy capital investment that constructing
new transit would require. Creating mobility, therefore, becomes a problem of unlocking
existing potential.
Greg Lindsay, a journalist and urbanist, told our research team: “With new mobility
comes the notion that there are assets everywhere that are in public and private and
community sectors, and it is all really an issue of how you bring together existing assets.
You can solve for networked assets.” At the same time policy makers should rethink
and reimagine existing systems to adapt to the emerging models of ownership. Some
shared systems, such as Uber and Airbnb, have seen considerable backlash in cities.
Rather than confronting or shutting down these services, governments should work to
create regulatory frameworks that make sharing work well with already existing civic
systems and goals. How can cities create legal, social, and economic platforms for
sharing?
3.5
Curating Authentic Local Experiences
Millennials’ desire for greater richness and variation in their experiences seems to trump
owning things for many Millennials. The sharing economy makes owning physical
assets not as attractive, from both a ﬁnancial and social perspective, so Millennials
instead crave a diﬀerent type of “thing” to acquire. Monique Dagnaud, a Paris-based
sociologist of Internet and youth culture, told us that Millennials gravitate towards new
experiences and sensations. This is not just about traditional cultural events, but also
includes experiences in retail, food, travel, and hospitality. Millennials are watching
the increased homogenization of spaces (through the rise of strip malls and chains),
which strips urban experiences of their uniqueness and diminishes why Millennials
ﬂock to cities in the ﬁrst place. But rather than just bemoan the ubiquity of big super‐
market chains, coﬀee shop franchises, and restaurants such as Tesco or Starbucks,
Millennials are looking for ways to ﬁll the niche with more local, nuanced, and
authentic experiences. For instance, a Berlin Millennial describes his quest for unique
experiences in the city. He says:
“There are a lot of houses and buildings from 20 years ago, and punk people kinda took charge
of these houses. The police tried to get them houses but they couldn’t. To stabilize their living
conditions, they have parties there on the weekends. That’s where I like to go. I don’t like to go
the big clubs, where it’s just about dancing and drinking. I like the more honest spaces.”
Of course, in every generation there is discontent about monopolies, whether these
monopolies are of the military, political, or economic variety. What is diﬀerent today
is that Millennials have the tools to invent valid alternatives. In their research on
online networks and individual agency, Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman argue:
522
S. Dumpawar et al.

“A diﬀerent social order has emerged around social networks that are more diverse and less
overlapping than those [of] previous [generations]. The networked operating system [that is
composed of other loosely but more broadly connected individuals] gives people new ways to
solve problems and meet social needs. It oﬀers room to maneuver and more capacity to act [on
one’s own].” [7]
This is to say that networked connectivity, technologically and socially, has given
Millennials a unique amount of power to create their own experiences. Millennials can
work from anywhere, set up a website in minutes, connect to a payment system such as
PayPal or Venmo, and start advertising on Facebook and Twitter in a matter of seconds.
Technologically savvy and geographically mobile, Millennials are on the hunt for unique
experiences and they put their skills and street-smarts to work creating or obtaining
products and services that are not generic and uniform. They invent new ways not only
of accessing and organizing cultural events but also spreading the word about them.
Much of this conversation happens on digital platforms, where Millennials can form
niche communities focused on like-mindedness. The unusual and serendipitous is
always an attractor. One young person in Detroit told us,
“I’ve gone to micro music festivals and concerts and the only way you ﬁnd out about them is on
Instagram… It’s really nontraditional; I’ve been to book signings with kegs. That Instagram
concert was in a community space next to this little bodega market in the villages and the only
way you were going to know about it is if you were following that market [on social media].”
And many such experiences are for sale: a cooking class with a top Michelin-rated
chef; a street tour with a Brooklyn graﬃti artist; or an excursion into New York City’s
Central Park at dusk to try out urban foraging. An Eventbrite sponsored research on
American Millennials suggests that Millennials value meaningful experiences over
accumulating possessions, and increasingly spend more time and money in seeking out
unique experiences [8]. According to the study, 69 % of Millennial participants felt that
attending live events helped them feel connected to “other people, the community, and
the world.” [9]
In relation to urban planning and design, this means that Millennials value the expe‐
riential aspects of a city along with its functional aspects. Many of the experts with whom
we spoke encourage a more experience-centric view that seems to correspond with
Millennials’ interest in experiencing and discovering the city. Experts have observed
how the transit system in cities can transform the experience of moving around. Georges
Amar, a futurist and mobility specialist, told the research team: “[in] the evolution of
the buses in the last 50 years you see that the windows have become bigger and bigger,”
to enhance the visual experience of moving around in the city. Supporting this view, a
young Parisian remarked, “I love to take the bus when I can, because I love to see the
city.” A few Millennials we spoke with in Paris and Istanbul expressed their preference
for particular modes of navigating the city because of the ways in which it allowed them
to experience the city visually and make new discoveries.
Millennials wish to discover new things and meet new people in the process of
moving around in the city. Millennials are not unique in this desire, but connectedness
oﬀers new opportunities to leverage their desire to explore. Location-aware apps such
as Foursquare have gamiﬁed the process of discovering places of interest in the city
through personalized recommendations and social connections. The growing popularity
Observations on Global Urban Millennials’ Social and Civic- Interactions
523

of geocaching and alternative reality games, which mix the physical and digital worlds,
encourage players to discover clues, locations, and trails hidden in the physical envi‐
ronment. These games suggest that this self-directed, digitally-guided progress through
a city can be a means by which to uncover its mysteries. Substantiating this view, a
young man in Detroit described his perfect commute. “I like to explore the city and not
go straight to the destination,” he said. “I like to ﬁnd some cool spots … That would be
my perfect commute, meeting people and ﬁnding new things in the midst of going
somewhere.”
This sort of drifting in the city is reminiscent of psychogeography, which emphasized
playful movements in urban environments to discover the city.

A Proposal for the Networked City: Seamless Connection
Between People, Places and Things
In the city of tomorrow, networked devices will be even more inexpensive and ubiqui‐
tous, and deeply incorporated into the fabric of our cities. In what we are referring to as
the Networked City, Millennials are able to eﬀortlessly connect with people, places,
things, and experiences. Systems are well-integrated, seamless, and intuitive; paying for
a parking ticket is as eﬀortless as calling an Uber and requesting a city service is as
seamless as ordering something on Amazon. These new civic services make use of the
digital features that Millennials increasingly expect in their day-to-day transactions. The
Networked City actively engineers social connections by creating spaces that make it
easier to meet people who share a common interest, profession or passion. These oppor‐
tunities for physical connection operate like social networks do online. In the following
paragraphs we outline two key aspects of the Networked City.
4.1
Urban Data
Cities are increasingly combining and analyzing data from multiple sources to under‐
stand various city functions (like mobility and public safety), ultimately inﬂuencing the
design and planning of cities. Through the installation of networked objects, cities have
begun to harness and interpret the data generated by mobile devices and social networks.
These data describe the urban environment, as well as the city’s day-to-day operations.
Some of these data have been released for public use through open data portals, allowing
services, apps, and websites to access and incorporate more detailed urban information.
In the Networked City, urban data are interlinked, open, easily accessible, and under‐
standable. Millennials have access to not only their own data but also their city’s, and
can track, utilize, and gain insights from urban data like they do from their personal
ﬁtness data.
4.2
Sociable Spaces
Millennials are used to forming social ties in the digital world, and expect urban space
in cities to enable similar connections. In our interviews and observations, we found that
524
S. Dumpawar et al.

Millennials are attracted to cities and neighborhoods with a high potential for social
interaction. Because social networks are much more diﬀused than they were when
Generation X members were in their twenties, Millennials place great value on places
where they can serendipitously meet people who share their interests and values. Social‐
izing has always been important for young people, but today the line between socializing
and networking has blurred. In the economy of freelance gigs, internships, part-time
jobs, micro-entrepreneurship, co-working, and working from home, with a deregulated
and ﬂuid job market, social encounters in cities have become a source of work and
livelihood for many Millennials. The Networked City brings diﬀerent people together
digitally and physically, and supports the formation of bottom-up communities through
deliberate design of space.
5
Conclusion
The past several years have seen an inﬂux of new – and younger – residents into cities.
These residents, known as Millennials, have been the focus of intensive research, but
much of this research has focused on their individual preferences and consumption
patterns. In this project, we attempted to use a multi-sited, multi-disciplinary approach
to better understand how these individual preferences can be shaped into a more respon‐
sive, more connected, more communal urban environment. We linked together Millen‐
nials’ love of online subscription apps, for example, and their increased transience within
urban centres. We linked urban data to personal ﬁtness data, and online Facebook groups
to physical meetups.
Through detailed observation of Millennials’ behavior in cities, as well as their
reported preferences, we were able to isolate several key ideas that will be essential to
city planners who want to design the cities of the future. These future cities, which we
describe as the prototypical Networked City, will be characterized by open feedback
loops, conversation between urban environments and residents, and expanded socia‐
bility. Civic oﬃcials will rebrand cities to focus on experience, rather than ownership,
and will work with Millennials to develop technology-focused urban ‘hacks’ that will
improve quality of life from the bottom up.
Millennials represent an enormous resource for urban governments. These residents
are young, technology-focused and passionate about urban space. Their dreams encom‐
pass the best of what technology can create, and their desire to participate digitally and
physically – in partnership with urban infrastructure - can transform the cities of the past
into the smart, connected cities of the future.

Abstract. Urban regeneration has become the new direction for smart city
development since the rise and expansion of mass new urban information and
communication technologies (ICTs), and the living lab method is now widely
used in participatory design and research to deep dig the urban lifestyle in the
context of regenerating urban sustainability. In this paper, we aim to build a multi-
dimensional community research model to describe the Beijing Hutong life by
living lab process. There are three layers in this model, i.e. infrastructure, activity
and information layer. The infrastructure layer includes the physical living envi‐
ronment and public facilities in Hutong; the activity layer is about how citizen
live in their home and communicate with their neighbors; and the information
layer describes the culture, organization and policy related to Hutong life. This
model is used in a collaborative project in Dashila, Beijing. The ﬁnal prototypes
and deliverables include the Traﬃc Caution Light Device, Energy Eﬃciency
Smart-Bill and RFID tag. The model & tools developed in this project will be
used to support the further urban regeneration research.

Introduction
In the current smart city construction, the urban regeneration and smart community has
become the new trend of technology-driven solution. The living lab and participatory
design method was originally developed in Europe, and there has been much experience
that could be borrowed to solve the China problems. In A collaborative class hosted by
Tsinghua University, Stanford University and Cinnovate Center, a NGO incubated by
Intel, we try to establish a multi-dimensional community research model, in which we
combine the Living lab and participatory design methods, to demonstrate the current
situation of the Hutong, to discover the design needs of community users, to deal with
and to carry on the urban sustainability research and the smart community construction.
New digital technology is opening a wave of urban regeneration. The Internet of
things connects the city infrastructure with other public facilities and citizens [1].
Collaborative technology is facilitating the transformation of function of the community,
and digital technology can help the city decision-makers in managing the integration of
city resources, public service and policy more intelligently through the use of big data

technology, which also enhance the public’s ability to solve problems directly and tend
to shape the new “sharing economy”. Sharing economy [2] is changing both what we
can do together across neighborhoods and how we think about sharing our time, mate‐
rials and skills. It is possible to design to boost resource management, economic well‐
being and social resilience by fostering sharing practices. In order to take advantage of
these opportunities, we are trying to pave the way to new forms of usage and introduce
novel interaction between several devices.

Smart City Platform and the Model of Hutong
2.1
The Directions of Smart City
“Smart City” is a slippery term applied to everything from urban design to higher
education policy. But the most universal deﬁnition is the use of information technology
to attack urban problems [3]. There are usually two directions [4]:
First is technology-intensive city, where sensors are everywhere and public services
are provided in a very eﬃcient manner. The International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) gives its own deﬁnition and interpretation “A smart sustainable city is an inno‐
vative city that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other
means to improve quality of life, eﬃciency of urban operation and services, and compet‐
itiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with
respect to economic, social and environmental aspects” [5].
Second is smart citizens, a better relationship between citizens and governments
leveraged by technology. The common characteristic is embarking from the reality of
the community needs, using the new techniques of digital tools, through participatory
design so that the public participate in the maintenance of the new community building
activities [6]. It increases both mobility and accessibility, allowing people to get access
to a great amount of local information and interact with others anytime and anywhere.
2.2
Build the People Oriented Smart City
To build the smart city, we will create methodologies, frameworks, and approaches to
enable the Smart Cities, a global network of smart cities and their applications that
securely and collaboratively work together to improve the quality of life of their citizens,
as well as greatly improve cost and energy eﬃciency of city operation and infrastructure
[7]. To truly develop Smart Cities, a combination of multimedia, human factors, and
user-centered systems methodology and design principles will have to be applied [8].
The introduction of broader participation to include such as the NGOs to improve the
quality of life in old cities and to form a good environment of the platform has important
signiﬁcance [9].
A lot of smart city projects have been created taking advantages of the development
of mobile devices [11]. Urban Mechanics New oﬃce and Boston University’s research
and development of the application of Street Bump—Boston is a typical case. When the
driver encounters turbulence, the software will use the phone’s accelerometer to detect
the data which is later returned to the municipal government [10]. Nairobi [12] is one
528
Z. Fu and Y. Bu

of the fastest growing metropolitan cities in Africa. Based on the survey’s ﬁndings, the
design team develops a mobile crowdsourcing application, called CommuniSense, to
collect road quality data. The application serves as a tool for users to locate, describe,
and photograph road hazards. Through “I love Beijing” [10] appliance reported to the
municipal government in China, the application can also ﬁnd a map of the city market.
Through crowdsourcing data people can use low cost sensor to measure and create
environment of crowdsourcing map; city government can use crowdsourcing data from
social media sites and smart phone sensors as a supplement to the urban network.
The Baitasi is an old neighborhood near the White Dagoba Temple with low-rise
residential housings and building districts that need regeneration. The Baitasi regener‐
ation plan is part of the 2015 Beijing international design week. The project explores
another urban renewal and community reconstruction through the design. Setting the
context in The White Pagoda Temple region, the project is themed around “connection
and symbiosis” and explores how to use culture as clues to the past relationship groups
within the community integration and today’s Internet and smart hardware, The Baitasi
regeneration plan include physical space update, basic energy transformation, public
environmental reconstruction and the overall region revitalization, while maintain the
unique culture of the neighborhood.
2.3
The Model of Hutong
But the building of new form of the Hutong community also encountered some prob‐
lems. First of all, although a lot of Hutongs are located in the historical and cultural
protection zone, they are not in good conditions. Secondly, Hutong tourism planning
and tourist routes for especially foreign visitors are not well-developed, which need to
be improved. Thirdly, while Hutong path can play a signiﬁcant role in urban traﬃc
system, it is a diﬃcult task to ﬁnd a balance between modern transportation planning
and the original atmosphere maintaining. Fourthly, life quality of Hutong residents has
not been improved; some residents are reluctant to change the traditional way of using
coal for heating [13]. Although there are continuous explorations in this area, the policy
measures, regulations and other implementation of the test is lacking. Therefore, we
attempt to use the method of living lab to build a multidimensional research model, to
encourage residents’ participation in the design and plan of their neighborhood, to meet
the needs of both Hutong revitalization and the residents’ life quality improvement.

Living Lab Method and Multidimensional Research Model
3.1
Living Lab Method
Living lab research method was originally proposed by an MIT professor William
Mitchell. It considers “living lab is a research method, in the diversity and evolution of
the actual living environment through perception, prototype, verify and improve all
kinds of complex solution”, laboratory environment brings the user to real life to verify
whether the demo is valid or not.
Constructing the Research Model of Beijing Neighborhood
529

Living lab is a kind of innovative research tool, used to improve the program to
develop the innovative products and services, through the actual application of the test
to enhance the applicability of products in the future market. Employment of user-driven,
open innovation pattern enables users to also become innovators. In the open living
laboratory, we aim to make the cycle of new product life endless and achieve continuous
improvement of the new products and services research development.
Living lab researchers advocate methods that facilitate co-operation in teams with
mixed expertise. These participatory methods provide a “third space” [14] for designers
and users to meet in. Artifacts or representations [15] that make sense to everybody
facilitate cooperative work; they further promote mutual understanding and help making
implicit knowledge explicit in the process [16] (Figs. 1 and 2).

3.2
Multidimensional Research Model for Hutong
Beijing Hutong is a place with rich history and culture. What we wish to do is to conduct
an in-depth research based on Multidimensional research model to construct new forms
of community. To focus on our research, the program is narrowed down to the TieShu
byway whose environment layer, activity layer and information layer is our main atten‐
tion. Through the development process of the city development model, we design the
model of Hutong focused on research direction from ”bottom to top “. At the same time,
multi-dimensional research model is a problem-oriented model owing to the growing
complexity and uncertainty of the city. To launch our design, we invite experts, research
teams, user groups, and the investors to participate in the whole design process.
Environmental Layer. Hutong of the environmental layer, including the physical living
environment and public facilities. In this layer we will use more research methods to
study the morphology, ecological system and social environment of space. Due to the
drawbacks of infrastructure, some problems such as Hutong road traﬃc jam is likely to
occur. However, there are positive cases, such as Hutong nameplate indicating system,
which is not only a part of a sense of the Hutong resident self-identity, but also helps
Hutong visitors with valid travel route indication information. Hutong has its own unique
environment, Beijing quadrangle is semi-closed house, the gate of the quadrangle has a
high threshold, so the car can’t be parked in the courtyard. In the past, the narrow roads
were not an issue as most people used to travel around by walking or cycling. However,
as more people switch to cars and electric bikes, it poses more transportation problems.
Some of the roads are simply too narrow for cars to pass through causing jams. Whether
the original shape of the Hutong is to be fully retained and how to solve the history
building problem, we need to consider profoundly.
Activity Layer. In order to understand the current situation of the life of the people in
the Hutong, we need to visit the family environment of the residents in the Hutong. We
divided user activity layer into two parts including “citizen’s ordinary life and commu‐
nicate with neighborhood” and “application and touchpoint”. As a traditional way of
life in the community, the people living pace is slower, their entertainment and leisure
style is more traditional, and the interaction between the neighborhoods is more close.
For example, the residents of the Hutong at home like watching TV, some residents still
maintain the habit of listening to the radio. Quiet and leisurely lifestyle in Hutong reﬂects
the citizen are mostly senior citizens and they are not used to accepting new things. What
we need to do is to understand the core Hutong community culture, respect the local
resident lifestyle. So our design should also be maintained as part of the Hutong emotion.
Information Layer. The use of cultural communication, government policy and tech‐
nical means facilitates the association of the physical world and the virtual world.
Construction of the city’s information technology development is inseparable from the
wisdom of the community. The construction of intelligent community utilizes the new
generation of information technology such as the Internet of things, cloud computing,
mobile Internet, intelligent terminal information and automatically perceive, timely
transfer and timely publish all kinds information closely related to people’s life to

achieve community “management, education services,” organic integration, to improve
community functions and to strengthen community service [17]. In information manage‐
ment, the government through the promulgation of policies, regulations inﬂuence on the
impact of the community. For example, by the end of August 2014, all Hutong residents
had started to use electric heating. So the government gave Hutong citizen special
subsidies for “coal to electricity” project. Support from the government gradually helps
the Hutong residents adapt to the new energy policy.

Living Lab Research Process
In order to carry out the problems and solutions for Hutong, we obtained skills from our
Living lab participatory process. We use diﬀerent design methods do Living lab research
and the following mainly takes Hutong traﬃc problems as an example (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3. Living lab research process summary
Observations. Observation [18] will also help us to understand users’ context, establish
common ground, and identify important terminology for better communication. From
our observation, even though there are only 2 lanes in the area, the roads do not jam up
often. This could be due to the fact that there are a larger percentage of people choosing
to walk instead of drive.
We can observe from this map that the width of the Hutong is inconsistent. The
inconsistency especially troubles new drivers as they are unfamiliar with the roads. If
they were to drive into a narrow road, they might not be able to proceed. Also we noticed
that there were several cars parking along the roadside permanently. Considering how
narrow the roads in the Hutongs are, car parked along the Hutong will only make it
narrower and inconvenient for drivers and other road users.

Interview. The Tsinghua group made several trips to Dashilar Hutong to conduct the
interviews. For interviews that were conducted in the residences, they were arranged by
student representatives and the community partners. With the help of our community
partners, we were able to arrange interviews with residents of the Hutong and even
conducted interviews in their houses. These interviews generally lasted an hour as we
went in depth asking about their lifestyle in the Hutong. Other than that, we also
approached store owners by buying a drink from them and pedestrians in the Hutong
with a short interview. In total, we conducted interviews with about 40–50 people.
Measuring and Counting. During one of the site visit to Dashilar, the Tsinghua group
decided to measure the width of the alley without the use of professional tools. Instead,
we measured them using our arm span. Every member linked arms and we calculated
the width of the alley according to the number arm span needed to reach from one end
to another end. With that, we made a map indicating the width of the Hutong.
Workshop. We test whether our ideas are feasible with a large population of Hutong
citizens from two groups: The ﬁrst group are 20 young people, the other group are 20
middle-aged citizens. By introducing participatory workshop, these ambiguities are
welcome: they invite participants to ponder advantages and drawbacks of each inter‐
pretation and form an opinion about what they saw. This is a way to engage them to
become designers. For example, the young group of participants hold that solving the
problem of traﬃc jam requires that there are more parking lot and increase parking
capacity. The middle-aged group of participants believe that the problem is because
many residents are more willing to park the car near their house. One possible solution
to this would be to ﬁne people who parked on the street at a rate that is higher than the
rate of parking lots close. Thus to disincentive people from parking there.
Data Monitor. We use map navigation app with GPS navigation function. The obser‐
vation was focused on the Beijing Dashilan road, based on the monitoring data of map
navigation tools, we can use Hutong road congestion data for quantitative analysis and
know when the rush hour of the day. But the disadvantage of this method is, nearly most
of map navigation app only collect the road congestion data of width more than 7 m in
Hutong. So a number of narrow lane road congestion data remain sparse.

Findings in Diﬀerent Layers
5.1
Reasons for Prototype Generation
Transportation Problems that Arises Daily in Tieshu Byway. According to Living
Lab design, we ﬁnd the main cause of traﬃc jam turns out to be an illegal parking on
the limited byway. Most of alleyways near Tieshu byway are measured from 5 m to
7 m2. The heavy traﬃc jam happens if the cars come from both directions into one alley,
blocked by parked cars. In this situation, car drivers are stuck on the street as long as
they enter the jammed area since other drivers come into the area back to back. We need
technological prototypes to help us explore how to deal with traﬃc jam. Therefore, we
Constructing the Research Model of Beijing Neighborhood
533

felt it necessary to come up with a solution to ease the traﬃc situation. This is also the
problem belonging to the environment lever in Hutong.
Lack of Information on the Energy Bill. The investigation of real energy bills of the
respondents validates that the current energy bills could be improved to be more user
friendly. Considering that the energy users in the Hutong are the low income old Beijing
citizens, the visualizing information would be readable for them. Also, since the existent
bills did not contain safety tips and ways to save energy, the inclusion of those advice
on the new smart bills will be the most eﬀect way to encourage household to economize
on energy.

Prototype and Demo Presentation
6.1
Demo: Energy Eﬃciency Smart-Bill and Stickers
Based on the original electricity bills which is diﬃcult to understand, we made a visu‐
alization improvement for the Hutong residents. Firstly, there is a clip at the top right
corner. It is cut into a “U” shape which can help users to carry bills. Secondly, with the
content of the bill, residents can compare the recently electricity cost and the cost in
former years through the bill, so that they can have the idea of when they use most
visually. At the same time, the residents’ electric bills would be compared with their
neighbors. Residents would know if their energy use is higher than the average level or
not, which could help them save energy. Thirdly, It is designed to be a label that can be
pasted in the form of two-dimensional code or used FRID technology, users can scan
through the phone to get more abundant information. In addition, the households can
attach the stickers on their appliances, such as fridge, air conditioner, heater, and TV.
Residents could paste them on the appliances so that people would know which kind of
appliance costs more electricity, and which kind of appliances may be ignored. More‐
over, considering stakeholders including power suppliers and advertisers, there is an
advertising area on the bill to improve the feasibility of the bill design. We also
encourage residents to pay the electricity bills online, by which residents could receive
online electricity bills containing even more information than those papery. The form
of label allows the user to see the information more clearly and obviously.
6.2
Traﬃc Congestion Traﬃc-Caution Light Device
From the interview result and our ﬁeld observation, traﬃc congestion problem was very
serious in Hutong. Congestion usually happened in the main street, when people went
to work and went home. By measuring the width of streets and analyzing the shapes of
Hutong, we found that traﬃc congestion was mainly caused by a strong need of parking
area, the narrow streets, and the large vehicle ﬂow (Fig. 4).
So we design the traﬃc caution light device focused on the Hutong road’s width less
than 7 m. When traﬃc congestion happens and lasts more than 5 min, the traﬃc caution
light will turn yellow. It means there was a traﬃc jam but just lasted for a little while.
But when the light turns red it means that the traﬃc jam was last more than 10 min so
534
Z. Fu and Y. Bu

we do not recommend you to drive through this road. In this way, we could remind the
drivers, if there’s traﬃc congestion, drivers are advised to take a turn or stop their cars
in advance. The traﬃc light demo was made by Arduino Electronic component and it
includes a number of Infrared sensors. While it will also bring some problems. For
example, we need so many Infrared sensors set every few meters on the road. Obviously,
it will cost a lot of money. At the same time, the Infrared sensor to identify the accuracy
of road congestion is not very high, because the temporary stop of the vehicle blocking
the side of thee roads will cause the signal’s error. So it is still a simple demo, we hope
it can be further improved, using NFC technology to identify the running condition of
the car on the road and judging the road congestion more accurately (Fig. 5).
Fig. 5. Traﬃc light device demo
6.3
Evaluation
There are various modes of approaches to measure demo eﬀects. Traditionally, there are
two methods including using questionnaires administered after an experience, which
asks the user to rate his/her feelings about what happened, and analysis of videotaped
sessions with users that typically combine interpretation of think-aloud commentary
with deciphering of other cues of emotion (smiling, gestures and the like) to develop an
impression of user’s eﬀective reactions [19]. In the design process, we ensure that the

535

participatory evaluation of the whole process is suﬃcient to open, and maintain inter‐
active response and feedback to the public evaluation (Fig. 6).
Fig. 6. Audiences’ comments in the project exhibition
6.3.1
Energy Eﬃciency Smart-Bill and Stickers Evaluation
So we participate in design method to evaluate our design demo, we give energy eﬃ‐
ciency Smart-Bill & stickers to 50 citizens who live in Hutong, recording user’s behav‐
iors when they receive bill’s (including facial expressions and body languages). Ask
users about diﬀerences between the old bill and the eﬃciency Smart-Bill Energy and let
us be informed of whether diﬀerences are important to or oﬀensive to users. We focus
on the behaviors when they receive stickers, for instance, whether user will paste stickers
immediately on household appliances, or drop it directly. We ask the users whether they
like this design, whether they think it is useful and able to enhance their awareness of
environmental protection, and other related issues.
According to the feedback: A number of payers do not concern with their energy
bills; Some payers who do business in the Hutong regard the utilities as the ﬁxed cost,
which is inﬂexible to be saved. While some residents consent that current bill provides
little information, so we still have areas to improve.
6.3.2
Traﬃc Congestion Traﬃc-Caution Light Device Evaluation
In user testing, because we only use Arduino to complete a demo, not in the real road
in the Hutong erecting sensor monitoring road congestion. So we built a simulated
Hutong crossroad experiment scene, inviting Hutong citizens (each citizens can control
in the hands of the toy car, the simulation Hutong’s “driver”). We set up demo at one
of the intersection. We put the device to test whether the drivers were able to make the
corresponding reﬂection including making timely feedback and congestion avoidance
behavior when they saw the light. By testing 30 drivers, we watch user behaviors to
prove that the analysis of the design of our program is able to play the role of traﬃc
congestion warning indication. According to the results of the experiments, we found
that 30 drivers would pass through the road directly when they saw the green light. When
the light turned yellow, 15 drivers would stop and observed the road condition. While
only when the light turned red, there would be more than half of the drivers to stop and
look, paying attention to light meaning, and made corresponding reaction such as
536
Z. Fu and Y. Bu

stopping or turning to another intersection. The experiment reﬂected that our designed
devise confused the drivers, so the recognition was not strong.
Through prototype testing, we provide a reliable direction for future improvements
based on the feedback from the user. The challenges about Caution Light Device Traﬃc:
Some of the drivers may not be bothered with the device; The drivers cannot detour or
u-turn once they are in the lanes in the Hutong. What the design can borrow ideas from
are as follows: One of the reasons for traﬃc jam in Hutong is that the drivers do not
know this road has been blocked and continue to go inside; There are a large number of
the users hoping there is a traﬃc jam early warning function combined with existing
mobile map navigation, so it can design a suitable route to avoid congestion ahead of
time.
7
Discussion and Next Steps
A suitable model helps us to better perceive the problems we study, to ﬁnd relevant
answers. Model is the basis of our understanding. Through the model we can describe
the multidimensional level of the Hutong, to help us to understand the culture of the
Hutong and the real needs of the residents. We develop design tools to help users to
better participate in our project, better explore and deﬁne the user requirements, more
eﬀectively get useful information and data. The project has completed the ﬁrst iteration
process from research to evaluation, in which we validated the ﬁrst major assumption
about the needs of local citizen. Next challenge is how to expand this project to the
broader community [20]. Move toward the goal of converting our project into a sustain‐
able activity to revitalize the local community.
New technologies will be the good way to collect the data, and record people’s
activities in the Hutong, but we need to think more about how to embed it in people’s
daily life in an unobtrusive manner. We will look for the opportunities to establish a
sustainable mechanism and ecosystem. In the case of Hutong, we will co-build the
community innovation lab with Cinnovate Center to promote community residents’
participation in their own initiative, and to form the eﬀective mechanism among the
community residents, the changemakers, NGOs the neighborhood committee and local
government.

Conclusion
Living lab as an innovation method has been widely applied in the Europe, but in China
it is just at the very beginning stage. In this paper, we use it to construct new forms of
the Beijing Hutong. We designed Energy Eﬃciency Smart-Bill and RFID tag, which is
used as the guide and instruction manual to carry out the experiment. For congestion in
Hutong, we do technical prototype to demonstrate a Traﬃc Caution Light Device, which
can indicate road congestion in the Hutong and also act as one of the Hutong’s geotag.
These tentative prototypes supported the further researches in the infrastructure level,
activity level and information levels of Hutong. The model combined with the Living
lab methods assist us to demonstrate the state of the Hutong, to discover the design needs

of community residents, to carry on the sustainable urban development and to construct
the smart community in the future.

Introduction
With a rapid urbanization across the developing countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle
East, and Latin America and a slower but continuing urban growth in the developed
world, 2.5 billion people worldwide are poised to become urban dwellers in the next
three decades. As populations swell, some of these cities will grow as great centers of
wealth creation while others are likely to fail due to the lack of a clear vision and devel‐
opment strategy [1]. The concentration of activity in cities has led to a ﬁerce competition
to attract human capital and manage resources. In China alone, there are 300 cities
designated as pilot Smart Cities competing for government support, global resources,
and technology innovation. Each of these cities is seeking a unique identity and inno‐
vative strategy to attract new talent, improve quality of life and advance its position in
the national and international marketplace. In order to achieve these goals, a new breed
of digitally savvy city leaders and managers will be required to understand the potential
of new technologies and how these can unlock the value proposition of Creative Cities.

The Creative City
2.1
Overview
As cities are now competing more than ever for global recognition, there is a need to
unlock the true potential of cities based on a more holistic approach incorporating strat‐
egies embodying design thinking, resource optimization, system integration and stake‐
holder engagement, enhanced via new technologies, fundamental to harnessing the
creative potential of cities. This issue is indeed one of the most challenging to deﬁne,
as it is a combination of hard and soft assets that make up the creative composition of
cities. This paper seeks to provide a brief overview of the notion of Creative Cities and
how through the process of deﬁning the potential of each city, leaders and managers can
gain insight into the ways that Creative City methodology can be applied to their city;
to have an ultimate impact on the growth, quality of life and sustainability and to better
understand how new technologies can achieve these goals.
2.2
The Unique Identity of Cities – Macro
Throughout the world, cities have been competing on many levels to attract trade, labor
and other resources while at the same time deﬁning their unique identities. The Creative
City is based on many factors that must be incorporated to establish a unique position
based on a combination of identity, positioning and resource allocation that each city
oﬀers within local and global markets. The Creative City concept is based on the prin‐
ciple that in order for a city to reach its full potential, these elements must be identiﬁed
and optimized. These multi-facets are represented in The Cities of Opportunity 2015
Report published by PwC ranking cities based on multiple indices that provide a wide
spectrum of criteria to measure the success of cities. The report analyzes the trajectory
of 30 major cities, all capitals of ﬁnance, commerce, and culture through their current
performance criteria and what makes these cities function better [2]. As deﬁned in the
PwC report, technology, intellectual capital and openness to the world through tele‐
communication access are some of the key drivers of the growth and prosperity of cities.
When deﬁning the key drivers, technology quickly bridges to innovation and creativity.
Today cities around the world are being revitalized through many diﬀerent strategies.
For example, the regeneration of historical districts in Shanghai, government green
design policies in Berlin, and the re-branding of Florence, Italy to call attention to its
exceptional cultural legacy, eﬀorts in each case that were planned to capitalize on the
unique consumer appeal of each destination. The Creative Cities concept can be used
to facilitate this renewal process by developing strategies that capture the inherent char‐
acteristics of a city or region, employing various strategies to channel these assets into
a comprehensive, integrated approach to reﬂect the city as a desirable place to live, work,
play and invest and to inform city leaders how to unlock the true potential of their city.
As part of this movement, many cities have ﬁnally realized the importance of soft
resources and have invested in the creation and development of major business and
cultural events in the form of expos, trade fairs, industry forums, ﬁlm and fashion festi‐
vals, with each city looking to be diﬀerentiated in the global market by these venues.
The Creative City: An Innovative Digital Leadership Program
541

Cities around the world like London, Beijing and New York have established major
cultural events that have indeed created highly signiﬁcant global recognition and
economic beneﬁts.
2.3
Innovation Districts - Geographic
According to the Brookings paper “The Rise of Innovation Districts: A New Geography
of Innovation in America,” new districts are emerging, where “leading-edge anchor
institutions and companies cluster and connect with start-ups, business incubators and
accelerators.” Featured as “physically compact, transit-accessible, and technically-
wired,” these new urban zones as “innovative districts,” are supporting mixed-use
development and have been considered to be a new model for economic growth.
At a time when stagnant growth, rising social inequality and increasing environ‐
mental degradation are posing great challenges to the cities, the emergence of innovation
districts can play a unique role in stimulating local economies by encouraging and facil‐
itating co-invention and co-production across sectors and disciplines, in reducing
inequality with its capacity to include more disadvantaged population in the growth, and
in rehabilitating the environment through more eﬃcient and friendly use of land [3].
Similar to industrial districts and suburban science parks, innovation districts are
also manifesting as well as changing the preferences of people and industry in current
technology driven activities, creating new models that connect the forging of economy,
the management of place, and the building of network [3].
2.4
Building Capacity and Improved Decision-Making – Integrated Approaches
to Policy and Leadership
An integrated assessment for urban sustainability and development, as Dawson and
colleagues point out, is “much more than an exercise in modeling and data analysis.”
Rather, it must consider and connect both the hard and soft systems, focusing on the
interaction between and involvement of researchers and stakeholders. The integrated
approach distinguishes itself in its great emphasis on the “explicit and transparent”
reﬂection and learning process in urban planning and management [4].
The ﬁrst element of an integrated approach is to engage the end users in deﬁning
policy questions and drivers, in order to set a practical goal and scope of the assessment.
In this way not only the relevance of research is justiﬁed in a policy context, but also
the decision makers will be inspired to engage in the process as it progresses, which is
“particularly important in an evolving policy landscape” [4]. Moreover, it is important
that the integrated assessment participates in a wider “dialogue,” an interaction with the
urban area, i.e., no matter being carefully designed or coincidently happened, the
approach can be a monitor and displayer of urban changes through its regular reviews
and updates.
In addition to direct economic costs and beneﬁts which are easier to capture, it is
also vital to employ a more complex and sophisticated approach in the evaluation of
long-term urban sustainability delivering, since issues such as amenity, social beneﬁts,
political costs can hardly be measured in a tangible way. Therefore, “non-monetary
542
C.G. Kirwan et al.

approaches” must be considered and developed in mainstream decision-making and
methods such as multi-criteria analysis will help the decision makers understand the
impacts of diﬀerent choices.

Theory and Methodology of Creative Cities - Digital Leadership
3.1
Purpose
The Creative City concept must deﬁne an innovative approach that optimizes the unique
identity and speciﬁc resources of each city. With the emergence of new Smart City
models currently being applied across major cities throughout the developed and devel‐
oping world, there has been an increased need to train city leaders about the complex
systems and strategies related to the innovative management of cities. The Creative City
Digital Leadership Program is a new initiative to ﬁll this void by enabling city leaders
to be exposed to global best practices in the planning, design, implementation and oper‐
ation of a new generation of digitally based tools to optimize the functions of cities. The
ultimate purpose is to improve quality of life for its citizens, stimulate economic growth
while preserving and protecting the natural environment.
However, innovation is an ambiguous word that can have many meanings and appli‐
cations as seen through the multifarious interpretations of the recent explosion of this
term applied to companies and cities. Innovation primarily derives from the technology
sector and has been a means to unlock potential at diﬀerent scales from people, compa‐
nies, cities and nations. In some cases, Innovation has now been equated with the poten‐
tial of global economies as the primary driver of change and future growth. In the
knowledge economy, innovation is what underpins the creation and management of IP
linked to research and development of new technologies. In fact in some countries where
manufacturing has been replaced by the knowledge economy, as in the case with the
UK, innovation and the development of IP has become a critical part of the GDP and
may be one of the most deﬁning factors in economic growth and sustainability.
The Creative City concept builds on the unique drivers of each city to explore,
augment and perpetuate greater soft power in cities made possible by advancements in
new technologies, digital systems, media, big data and behavioral analytics including
smart cities and innovative approaches to city management. The Creative City meth‐
odology explores the key factors that allow cities to stimulate and support innovative in
order to unlock their creative potential. These elements can be in the form of important
research, pilot projects and the establishment of applications that provide the exploratory
functions to unearth potential innovation at diﬀerent scales from community-based
projects to large-scale citywide development.
3.2
Methodology: Macro City DNA – Deﬁning the Unique Strengths/Assets
Each city has its own unique DNA that combines geographic location, physical layout,
socio-demographic composition, cultural and physical resources, including workforce,
and industry sectors. Professor Michael Porter from Harvard University focuses on how
to optimize these resources to achieve competitive advantages [5, 6]. Building on
The Creative City: An Innovative Digital Leadership Program
543

Porter’s model, each city needs to understand its unique DNA to achieve its maximum
potential. The CITY DNA model allows cites to develop a strategy based on the creative
and cultural assets in order to identify a core DNA. From this base, a theoretical and
practical methodology can be developed that proposes a combination of City Branding,

The Creative City Leadership Program builds on these elements to develop a training
program to help city leaders understand how to map and visualize a strategy that connects
physical and virtual urban systems from unique stakeholders’ points of view based on
the CITY DNA perspective. To partially illustrate this process of diﬀerentiation, a
comparative study was conducted by Kirwan/Fu Information Architecture class at
Tsinghua University to map the creative industries within leading cities in China with
the result of better understanding the competitive strengths of these cities.

Methodology: Design Thinking - Strategies for Broader Applications
Across multiple business lines, cities are now looking at new innovative models derived
from tech culture - body storming, hackathons, start-ups incubators - while simultane‐
ously introducing interdisciplinary approaches and borrowing methodologies from outside
fields including design where companies such as IDEO, FROG and others have brought a
more holistic approach to innovation. Design thinking plays a key role in establishing an
open source, iterative process that allows for ideas and collaboration to stimulate interdis‐
ciplinary solutions. This is due to the inherent nature of the design process to identify gaps
and propose comprehensive solutions. Unlike many other disciplines, design is able to
adapt itself to each context and to form a language inherently connected or drawn from that
unique combination of factors. Therefore, design thinking requires an open-ended approach
that the design process is capable of facilitating. Creative City Digital Leadership Program

draws from the key strategies of Design thinking to unearth the potential concepts that can
define the programming of cities (Fig. 2).

3.4
Methodology: The Practice of Convergence (Interdisciplinary Approach)
The convergence of design thinking, advanced computation and business innovation is
now at the core of new educational models and has led to the emergence of hybrid
professional ﬁelds and careers such as Information Architecture, User Experience, Data
Visualization and other new media related ﬁelds that have drawn from diverse areas of
knowledge and are now inﬂuencing the nature of how cities are rethinking their approach
[7]. The Creative City Digital Leadership Program develops a comprehensive planning
methodology that draws from the key strategies across diﬀerent disciplines including
economics, urban planning, sustainable design, ecology, sociology and behavioral
sciences, computer programming, media and interactive design. This process examines
both macro and micro aspects and develops urban strategies to provide a broader
conceptual understanding of how and why these applications serve to enhance the expe‐
rience of cities [8].
3.5
Methodology: Collective Intelligence
The Creative City Digital Leadership Program utilizes theories and applications of
collective intelligence to visualize and model patterns and trends of cities [9]. Data
visualizations of the ‘urban pulse’ provide insights into urban behavior and lifestyle
trends to better understand how cities work, enabling city leaders to gain valuable
insights for the planning and design of their cities. A key aspect of the application of
collective intelligence is to create urban-scale, multi-sector datasets to deliver compre‐
hensive urban simulations [10]. By collecting data and visualizing information across

multiple urban functions, it is possible to understand how the interdependencies of urban
functions, both physical and virtual, may be optimized through the planning and design
of innovative interventions to achieve the creative potential of cities.

The Creative City Innovation Alliance
Three institutes will form one new entity representing the new Creative Cities Innovation
Alliance that will serve as a collective think-tank as well as the founding contributors
of the Creative Cities Digital Leadership Program:
Service Design Institute, Academy of Arts and Design, Tsinghua University. As a
new integrated discipline, service design combines theory and methodologies from
multiple ﬁelds bridging academia, industry and government to provide real solutions
and applications to the complex problems facing the advancement of our society,

environment and the global economy. In order to achieve China’s vision to progress
from a nation of manufacturing to knowledge industry and to become a pioneer in design
and technology innovation, the Chinese government has initiated national plans based
on the integration of the IT industry with traditional industries and university-industry
collaborative innovation programs across China and linking to the world. Design and
the fusion of culture and technology are the core impetuses for this industry reform. The
role of the Service Design Institute at Tsinghua University is to develop innovation
models to promote and advance the new category of service design while stimulating
business innovation in China. Based on an international platform, collaborative format
and shared research, the Service Design Institute focuses on the creation, education,
promotion, and connection of a new Service Design framework. There are two new
opportunities in China for Service Design in the context of Smart Cities: “New Lifestyle
Design” and “Design for People” rethinking and redesigning the urban experience via
infrastructure, mobility, healthcare, retail, recreation, and to create new opportunities
for the private sector shaping the new lifestyle for today and future citizens.
Design Beijing Lab, Academy of Arts and Design, Tsinghua University. Within the
Service Design Institute, Design Beijing Lab utilizes design thinking to actively develop
projects for the economic, social and environmental beneﬁt of Beijing. The lab has
worked on many Smart City applications and has participated in Beijing Design Week
and Beijing Smart City Expo for the past 6 years bringing new ideas related to the
interface between humans, computer and cities. The lab functions as a platform for
research, planning, design and experimentation for new media applications. Multi-
disciplinary teams conduct analysis of urban activity in both the physical and the virtual
realms and the patterns of citizen interaction, providing valuable data for the identiﬁ‐
cation of key trends and opportunities for new urban lifestyle applications. As a result,
cities, companies and individuals are enabled to better adapt and improve, creating
solutions for the public future wellbeing and quality of life.
Henley Business School Informatics Research Center. Part of Henley Business
School at the University of Reading, the Informatics Research Center (IRC) provides a
center for interdisciplinary and collaborative research in Informatics. Beneﬁting from
input of knowledge and expertise from various subject ﬁelds, including Biodiversity,
Business Management, Economics, Information acquisition and assimilation, Intelligent
Pervasive Spaces, Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Systems Engineering,
across a number of Schools and beyond, the IRC aims to construct digital infrastructures
for innovations in domains of business and management, IT for strategic management,
enterprise information systems, ﬁnancial modeling and prognostics, bio-computing,
construction management, intelligent buildings, pervasive intelligent spaces, and IT
supported collaborative work. The role of digital infrastructures construction is to boost
ICT capacities for both decision-makers and the city operation systems, facilitating the
implementation of creative city plans [11].

competitive advantage for cities that embrace it, challenge is also posed to the eﬃcient
and eﬀective operation of a much more complex urban systems, requiring a new gener‐
ation of digital leaders who can critically think about the ways in which digital tech‐
nologies can be utilized, to creatively manage the resources and to coordinate among
the stakeholders. As a collaborative network platform set up by Henley Business School,
the Digital Leadership Program aims to close the gap between supply and demand of
digital leadership skills required in driving business and public sector innovations [12].
Incorporating a series of research and knowledge transfer projects, the program is
designed to explore the strategic role of leadership in the digital economy, to exchange
research ﬁndings, practices, policies and programs in digital leadership, and to enhance
leaders’ competencies in technology-enabled decision-making.
Parsons MFA in Design and Technology. Today’s designer faces two fundamental
challenges: the expanding inﬂuence of design within society and the growing role of
technology within design. The MFA in Design and Technology (MFA DT) provides
students with a lively and dynamic environment in which to use design research, process,
applied theory, and writing to address these challenges. Students push their experimen‐
tation beyond the visual: Design is seen as a mechanism for developing strategies,
knowledge organization, business structures, and social consciousness. Areas of study
include Interaction (mobile, games, Web, and installation), Physical Computing
(programming code and chip-based applications such as toys, fashion, media in archi‐
tecture, and performance technology), 2D and 3D Animation, Motion Graphics, and
Digital Filmmaking.
Parsons Institute for Information Mapping. Parsons Institute for Information
Mapping (PIIM) is a Research, Development and Professional facility within The New
School and located in New York City. PIIM’s mission is to advance the ﬁeld of Knowl‐
edge Visualization through academic and commercial pursuits. PIIM researchers and
staﬀ disseminate their expertise in information categorization, knowledge representa‐
tion, information taxonomy development, information logic and ranking/scoring,
knowledge visualization, and Graphic User Interface (GUI) and User Experience Design
(UXD) by developing powerful tools and methods for decision makers and analysts.
PIIM’s work seeks to increase decision maker and analyst cognition of complex data
sets via eﬃcient experiences and visualizations. In both its own research and in its
engagements with government agencies, corporations and other organizations, PIIM
pushes the boundaries of information, engineering and visual design to develop new
ways of thinking about information — and to build and deliver corresponding real world
solutions [13].

The Creative City Research Projects
Creative Cities Innovation Alliance incubates academic research and projects that
support the development of cities as centers of innovation. An example of a past project
from Prof. Fu/Kirwan at Tsinghua University’s Design Beijing Lab includes InnoZone,
part of Beijing Smart City Expo (Fig. 4).

interactive visualization project aimed at users that want to enhance their understanding
and ability to engage in cultural activities within the city based on their individual proﬁle
and personal interests. By sourcing all types of activities in Beijing via the Internet, both
men and women and people at diﬀerent stages of life can pursue self-realization and life
long learning by identifying and participating in appropriate activities including lectures,
exhibitions and salons based on geographic location and accessibility. In addition to
serving individual users, the InnoZone system, built using Arduino, mines and compo‐
sites data collected over time and maps this information on a central citywide visuali‐
zation illustrating emerging patterns of cultural activity within Beijing. The project was
debuted at during Beijing Design Week’s Smart City Expo.

Conclusion
The Creative City Innovation Alliance, with participants: Tsinghua University, Henley
Business School and Parsons/New School University, has been formed to create a global
partnership with the goal of training city leaders in identifying the unique cultural
resources of their cities and ﬁnding ways to unleash their potential as Centers of Inno‐
vation. By establishing research bases in Beijing, London and New York, this alliance
will take advantage of being situated in the leading centers of growth, technological
advancement and mega-trends.
The Alliance plans to oﬀer the Creative City Digital Leadership Program, an online

Abstract. Smart Cities with their mobility system are assumed to be based on
smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration, assigning citizens signif‐
icant roles. While some argue that ICT will enhance democratic debate and
empower citizens, others concern about the development of Smart Cities “without
critical discussions and politics”. Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry (METI) launched its Smart City project in 2010, setting speciﬁc criteria
to ensure the “participation of all the stakeholders”; however, drawing on analysis
of oﬃcial documents as well as on interviews with each of the four Smart
Communities’ stakeholders, the paper explains that very little input is expected
from Japanese citizens. Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric util‐
ities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of
these experiments would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather
to make them participate in the co-production of public services.

Introduction
Establishment and management of better mobility system has become an essential part
of smart cities because of its importance for smarter environment. Participation of
pedestrians and drivers is indispensable to design and deliver smart mobility system;
however these co-creation processes are not yet theoretically developed and are diﬃcult
to implement in practice. The paper thus tries to understand these mechanisms from
similar processes of Smart Cities and draw lessons from those cases.
Japan has been facing three main challenges concerning ecological issues as many
other countries: reducing CO2 emissions in order to mitigate climate change; ensuring
its energy independence and security (renewable energy, energy conservation and eﬃ‐
ciency improvements); revitalizing its economy by strengthening its competitiveness
and becoming a leader in future “green” markets. To deal with these issues, the Japanese
Government has been implementing various initiatives, among which regulations and
subsidies, but also schemes such as a feed-in-tariﬀ for renewable energy and eco-cities’
experimentations since the Eco-Town program launched in 1997.

Community, Toyota Smart Melit (Mobility & Energy Life in Toyota City), and Yoko‐
hama Smart City – within the “Demonstration of Next Generation Energy and Social
Systems” project. Although only one of these is oﬃcially entitled “smart city”, the New
Energy Promotion Council (NEPC), a METI agency, deﬁnes these projects as “smart
cities [which] are a new style of city providing sustainable growth and designed to
encourage healthy economic activities that reduce the burden on the environment while
improving QoL (Quality of Life)”.
Smart Communities are based on smart grid technologies, which associate informa‐
tion ﬂows to energy ﬂows in order to optimizing the energy production and distribution,
introducing safely as much renewable energy as possible and achieving peak shift
through dynamic pricing or demand response schemes. However, Smart Communities
aim at going further and beyond the mere smart grid, focusing not just on energy issues
but also on the involvement of all the stakeholders. Another objective is to make “smart”
not only the grid, but also industry, commerce, business and households’ behaviours,
including mobility issues. According to METI’s call for projects and Smart Commun‐
ities’ master plans, a very innovative feature of Smart Communities is the participation
of all the stakeholder among which the citizens, and the behavioural change through
lifestyle innovation.
The paper thus investigates the citizen participation system and eﬀectiveness in
Japanese Smart Communities, as it has been pointed out as a crucial factor of success
for eco and smart cities [1], especially when energy infrastructure and natural resources
management are involved [2, 3]. However, the “participation” quoted in the call for
projects and Master Plans do not seem to have been implemented on a large scale.
Although the time period for application was rather short (one year) and did not allow
the citizens to participate in the process of building the project, documents and inter‐
views with the four Smart Communities stakeholders revealed that few signiﬁcant
participatory systems such as deliberating workshops or civic forum were neither
embedded into the master plan, nor organized since the beginning of the implementation.
Indeed while observing Japanese Smart Communities it appears that citizen partic‐
ipation does not really take place but also was not actually part of the objectives. There‐
fore, the research also seeks to explain this gap between claimed and actual citizen
participation. Numerous social studies have highlighted serious acceptance problems
encountered by energy infrastructure [3–5] and especially smart grid-based projects [6,
7]. These studies consider participation of citizen as well as their mere consultation or
feedback request as key factors to their acceptance of the project. Furthermore, behav‐
iour change policies in the ﬁeld of energy consumption are considered to have resulted
in a series of failures for many years [8–10], and recent studies in social psychology and
behavioural economics have been promoting new tools in order to overcome behaviour
change obstacles [11–14].
Interviews with local governments and private sector stakeholders revealed that each
Smart Community focuses on changing participants’ behaviours rather than on
promoting their participation as citizens. Thus, the paper intends to analyse the policy
tools implemented in order to promote citizen acceptance and behaviour change in
Japanese Smart Communities, and to understand what kinds of knowledge are mobi‐
lized. Furthermore, the issue of citizen participation as a policy instrument promoting
552
H. Kudo

acceptance and behaviour chance rather than participation in policy and decision making
will be discussed. The paper examines the questions through document analysis and
interviews with the stakeholders of the projects.
The paper begins by exploring theories of participation to see how it has been trans‐
formed under New Public Management (NPM) and later with the introduction of New
Public Governance (NPG). As Smart Communities use information and communication
technology (ICT), the potential impact of ICT on participation will also be investigated.
The paper then introduces Japanese Smart Communities and the research methodology.
It then examines the questions through document analysis and interviews with the
stakeholders of the projects. Although the authors conducted interviews within each of
the four initiatives, the paper focuses on Kitakyushu’s case as an illustration of Smart
Communities’ rationale. Kitakyushu has the advantage of exhibiting the same partici‐
patory mechanisms but with a more pro-active approach. While the other cases give
very little additional insights about public participation in smart cities, Kitakyushu’s
case allows us for more substantial investigation and analysis.
The paper tries to identify the importance of participation in co-designing and co-
production of Smart City through literature review as well as a Japanese case study and
understand the role of the citizen.

Literature Review
2.1
New Public Management (NPM) and ICT
New Public Management (NPM) was introduced into the traditional form of public
administration and changed its managerial style through a series of techniques imported
from business management [15]. Besides eﬃciency, eﬀectiveness, and accountability,
customer-oriented and/or outcome-oriented thinking has been introduced in policy
making and implementation processes [16]. Reform in public service delivery, inﬂu‐
enced by these orientations, forced public sector organisations to outsource some func‐
tions, privatize enterprises, and revise the role of government in accordance with the
role of private sector and civil society. Public and Private Partnership (PPP), the Private
Finance Initiative (PFI), and other forms of collaborations became alternatives to tradi‐
tional government restructuring. This trend has evolved into the public governance
model, with greater emphasis on integrating politics and management rather than relying
merely on the introduction of new management techniques.
With the introduction of NPM, markets, managers and measurement were introduced
[17]. Some of the characteristics of NPM were represented as decentralisation, manage‐
ment by objectives, contracting out, competition within government, and customer
orientation [18]. NPM also brought ICT into public administration and promoted e-
Government. Renewal of public management and public service delivery has then
become an important trend in recent public sector reform.
Introduction and use of ICT to improve managerial processes and to enhance
communication to and with the citizens is a key factor for a successful e-Government
policy. It ﬁrst developed as a tool for better governance in terms of eﬃciency in oﬃce
work/administrative systems/tasks, data processing and dissemination. However, it is
Co-design, Co-creation, and Co-production of Smart Mobility System
553

now recognized as an important tool of communication between government and its
stakeholders, providing an interface between them. E-Government has become one of
the most important elements in public sector reform, as it oﬀers transparency, account‐
ability, interface with citizens, access to information, and good governance, including
prevention of corruption. When there is high demand for accountability and transpar‐
ency, introduction of e-Government is a common strategy [19].
2.2
Public Service Delivery Under NPM and Public Governance
Many authors have focused their research eﬀorts on the analysis of decentralisation
processes, following the public governance approach. Following the implementation of
public sector reform based on NPM, the dimension of public administrations, especially
at the local level, has prompted renewed both practical and academic interest. The
dimension of local governments has become very important for two main reasons:
regional competitiveness and capacity to provide public services.
In terms of public services, it is important to highlight the impact of the decentrali‐
sation process especially on public administrations at the local level [20]. First, the
number of public services provided by local governments has increased. Secondly, the
decentralisation process has inﬂuenced local governments funding system, which has
changed from an indirect to a direct system, that is to say, local governments are increas‐
ingly ﬁnanced by their citizens. As a consequence, many local governments do not have
suﬃcient ﬁnancial resources to fund the provision of the services needed. These changes
are also accompanied by demands for increasingly complex public services, which are
diﬃcult for a single local government to provide. These administrations therefore need
new strategies to exploit their ﬁnancial, material and human resources more eﬃciently,
with the aim of satisfying citizens’ demand for increasingly complex services.
The decentralisation process has conﬁrmed new interests in institutional models of
governance among public administrations operating at diﬀerent levels and at the same
level. All this interest has grown within a theoretical framework known as “Public
Governance” [16, 17]. At citizen-related level, the most important objective stemming
from decentralisation is to have public services, which reﬂect diﬀerent needs and
requirements of the citizens, of a higher quality at lower cost [18]. These interests have
led to the network governance approach as well as participatory discourse.
2.3
Citizen as Stakeholder Under New Public Governance
Attentions on public service delivery and the role of citizens and social sector in its
process lead to New Public Governance (NPG). It was also proposed as critiques to
NPM, which merely stressed eﬃciency, eﬀectiveness and managerial techniques.
Some authors, in particular Osborne, ironically deﬁned NPM as “a transitory stage
in the evolution towards New Public Governance” [12]. Not only public service delivery,
but also the policy making process became key features of NPG. Bovaird pointed out
that “radical reinterpretation of policy making and service delivery in the public domain
resulting in Public Governance” [21].
554
H. Kudo

Indeed, NPG has adopted citizen-centric approach and tries to guarantee participa‐
tion of stakeholders, including social sector. It is based on network governance and
focuses on joined-up governance and co-production. Since the public service delivery
was the critical issue, which made NPM shift to NPG, it is considered as synonym of
New Public Service (NPS). NPG stresses the importance of democratic decision-making
and has evolved on changing characteristics of accountability.
Pestoﬀ pointed out that under NPG, “central role attributed to citizen co-production
and third sector provision of public services” [22], while Osborne deﬁned NPG as “it
posits both a plural state where multiple interdependent actors contribute to the delivery
of public services and a pluralist state, where multiple processes inform the public policy
making system” [12].
Stakeholder in network is a crucial element in NPG. Bovaird pointed out that gover‐
nance provides a set of balancing mechanisms in a network society and deﬁned NPG as
the ways in which stakeholders interact with each other in order to inﬂuence the
outcomes of public policies. NPG “seriously questions the relevance of the basic
assumptions of NPM that service delivery can be separated from service design, since
service users now play key roles in both service design and delivery”. And “service users
and professionals develop a mutual and interdependent relationship in which both parties
take risks and need to trust each other” [21]. Trust has thus become an important issue
under NPG.
Another keyword that many authors pointed out to describe the characteristics of
NPG has been negotiation. Bovaird wrote that “policy making is no longer seen as a
purely top-down process but rather as negotiation among many interacting policy
systems” and that “services are no longer simply delivered by professional and mana‐
gerial staﬀ in public agencies, but they are co-produced by users and communities” [21].
He pointed out “emerging role of user and community co-production.
It is clear, at least from the literatures, that NPM and then NPG both pointed out the
importance of participation, among others, while promoted e-Government. Smart City
projects are locally promoted ICT strategy, focusing mostly on the better use of energy
in the community, through incentives as well as disincentives and thus trying to change
the behaviour of the residents. Thus they could be good case to examine the NPG model.
2.4
ICT Potential for Participation
Some scholars consider ICT to be a powerful means to promote and improve public
participation [23, 24]. ICT may reduce participation costs by enabling citizens to partic‐
ipate through their mobile devices at any time and place [25]. The modes of expression
and communication provided by ICT also allow new publics to have interest and legiti‐
macy in participating in public aﬀairs [26]. Not only would ICT widen the public of
participation; it also has the potential to enrich the content of citizens’ input that would
no longer be solely in a discursive form [24]. Collaborative tools such as citizen sensing
and other interactive applications [27] have the potential to enhance democratic debates,
while information aggregators may facilitate citizen engagement [28].
E-participation, which mobilises ICT for participatory process, aims to increase citi‐
zens’ abilities to participate in the political process [29]. This can go beyond by not only
Co-design, Co-creation, and Co-production of Smart Mobility System
555

supplying citizens with information on public policies, but also giving them an oppor‐
tunity to co-create them. Interactions between governments and citizens consist of
provision of information, consultation and active participation of citizens on political
decision-making [30]. ICT supports these interactions [31], and is believed to renew the
trust in government [32]. In the electronic environment, citizens can interact with public
oﬃcials in a more informal way and the nature of interactions would therefore become
more horizontal and egalitarian [33].
Furthermore, it is worth noting that given the peculiarities of Japanese society,
scholars argue that more than elsewhere, ICT could greatly boost citizen participation
in Japan: for Ishikawa, “Internet is an ideal tool for jump-starting deliberative democracy
in Japan” [23]. Moreover, reﬂected by Sabouret who qualiﬁes Japanese as “homo tech‐
nophilus” [24], many scholars consider that Japanese people are keen to use new tech‐
nology. However, the possibility of ICT to stimulate public participation is subject to
criticisms. First, the promises of increased social inclusion may be counterbalanced by
new forms of exclusion, regarding the elderly in particular [34]. This caution is espe‐
cially relevant with regard to Japanese society since in 2014, 26 % of the population is
over 65 years of age. Second, although ICT allows for new forms of expression and
creativity, it also favours individualised patterns of participation at the expense of
collective patterns based on open discussion [35].
The paper takes Smart Community Projects as an example to examine the citizen
participation in Japanese NPM as well as NPG, which could reﬂect on the co-design,
co-creation, and co-production of mobility system.

Case Study
3.1
Methodology
This research is based on qualitative analysis and uses the following analytical tools:
research on primary documents, semi-directive interviews and ﬁeld observation. It ﬁrst
examined documents of METI and Smart Community cases, including their Master
Plans as well as press release and communication materials. Other related documents
were received directly from the institutions during the ﬁeld survey. This ﬁrst step aimed
to understand the extent of public participation, and to identify the nature of its mech‐
anisms.
Second, semi-structured interviews were conducted with METI, the local govern‐
ments and private actors involved in each project, as well as with Smart Communities’
inhabitants, from February to July 2014. In total, thirty-four interviews were carried out
with the main stakeholders.
Third, in the case of Kitakyushu, besides the interviews with two dozen of residents,
a ﬁeld observation was carried out. The author attended to one of the regularly scheduled
meetings of all stakeholders, including a representative of the citizens, and participated
in the Higashida Share Festival, held on 17–18 May, 2014, during which the author
talked with the residents on an informal basis.

town. It has hosted since 1901 the very ﬁrst Japanese steel works (Yawata Steel Works
was a public company, then became Nippon Steel), on which the city relies its devel‐
opment. After the successful overcome of the territory from typical pollution and issues
related to coal mining, fossil-fuel power station, and steel works, the territory launched
eco-friendly, eco-driven, eco-related, and ecological industries. It became one of the
ﬁrst cities to host landﬁll sites as well as factories for the recycling of consumer elec‐
tronics. The city used to rely on heavy industry, however has been successfully
converting into green economy. In the Higashida area of Yahata-Higashi ward, the site
of the operational experiments and of the Yawata Steel Works, the city is proceeding
with the development of a new city district on unused land. In the new district, the City
is pushing ahead with the establishment of a variety of new energy distribution infra‐
structure, for example, for the supply of energy produced by natural gas cogeneration
by means of the steelworks’ transmission network, and the supply of hydrogen produced
by the steelworks by pipeline to areas within the district.
Sketching a vision of the optimum form for community energy management, the
project seeks to create the appropriate social structures for a low-carbon society by
innovating lifestyles, business styles, and urban planning. By means of the establishment
and operation of a customer energy management system called Smart Community
Centre, the project aims to establish mechanisms for citizens and companies to think
about and participate in the process of energy distribution. The city believes that making
energy use visible can encourage change in lifestyles and business. In addition, other
initiatives include preparation for the large-scale introduction of next-generation vehi‐
cles and their linkage with public transport.
Due to factors including the establishment of environmental facilities and the intro‐
duction of a range of new energy sources, the Higashida area in Yahata-Higashi ward
of the City already emits 30 % less CO2 than other areas in the city. This trial aims, by
means of initiatives including further introduction of new energies, the use of community
energy management, and the establishment of new transport systems, to achieve a further
20 % reduction, reducing CO2 emissions to more than 50 % less than other areas in the
city. In order to achieve these goals, a Smart Community, which provides advanced
energy control and optimizes total energy distribution, encompassing electric vehicles
(EV) is established and in parallel with the establishment of charging infrastructure to
facilitate large-scale introduction of EV, the construction of next-generation traﬃc
systems linking bicycles and public transport.
It is clear that the city had concentrated its attention on energy, not necessary on ICT
driven services, although the very ﬁrst intention of METI was the smart gird, the smart
community, and the smart city in terms of ICT use. This is not because the city has strong
interests in environmental industry, but can be observed in other projects as well. It is,
however, not clear, if the city had really considered the project in terms of creating smart
city using ICT as major driver. From the oﬃcial materials of the municipality and
Co-design, Co-creation, and Co-production of Smart Mobility System
557

interviews conducted among the public servants in the municipality, it emerges that the
main focus of the municipality has been the energy issue, and not the community plan‐
ning and/or citizen services.
The residents were rather passive during these events, letting the local authorities
and the industrial actors decide for them and following their decisions. This tendency
can be observed in cities and territories, where there used to be dominant economic actor.
The citizen participation looks weak in both areas, not because residents are not inter‐
ested in their cities, but because they have strong trust in established institutions and let
them decide on their behalf.
3.3
Analysis: Co-design, Co-creation, and Co-production?
The private companies involved in the project had collaborated with the municipality
from a very early stage of the project, prior to the oﬃcial call of METI. They created a
secretariat for the project within the municipality, dispatching their staﬀ to it. They agree
that in this way, they were able to gain trust from the residents in the planned area. This
is conﬁrmed from the citizens as well. They agree to the fact that the major industrial
actors have been “the authority” together with the municipality in the territory.
The citizen participation is guaranteed in two processes; one is residents brieﬁng
before initiating the project involving residents and the other is feedback meetings during
the project implementation. During the ﬁrst, consensus building, especially for privacy
issue, was achieved. Since some experiments, including Dynamic Pricing, required data
gathering of private households, consensus of residents were needed. Most of the resi‐
dents in the area participated actively in the area, although there was no direct “partic‐
ipation” during the designing process of the project. This sounds a bit contradictory;
indeed, most residents agreed to participate in the project and gave consensus of gath‐
ering and using their household energy consumption data by the smart community
consortium, without strong concern and/or speciﬁc request to the project. During the
feedback meetings, the project team gathered information, opinions, and suggestions of
the residents. In these meetings, residents were asked to answer the questioner and
express their opinions. Besides some suggestions regarding the tariﬀ diﬀerences, few
opinions were gathered. This is not an isolated case in Japan; it is rather common that
these town meetings and feedback meetings get few feedbacks.
Many private companies actively participated in the project, since they have various
interests of their own; however there had been a clear hierarchy among them. They say
that it has been not a trouble, since the organization has functioned well. This view is
conﬁrmed by the municipality, which explained this tendency as trust to “the authority”.
The municipality has been the major actor together with a small number of private
companies. The city actively invested in the project in advance, following its environ‐
mental as well as industrial strategies. It has promoted Eco-town projects among others.
Their strategies have enjoyed strong support by the citizen and thus the smart city project
has also enjoyed strong support.
The project team, however, pointed out one interesting feature; changing behaviours
of the residents in terms of their energy consumption. Since the households get infor‐
mation about the details of their energy consumption, they now try to “save” energy in
558
H. Kudo

peak times, rationalising their consumption. This means that the dynamic pricing made
the residents aware of their consumption patterns, made them consume rationally, and
thus made them “save” energy at the same time.
Like in other Smart Communities Projects, also in Kitakyushu case, it appears that
citizen participation does not really take place but also was not actually part of the
objectives. Citizen participation was formally designed in the process, but it has never
actively implemented.
The results of interview also reminds us to consider the trust factor in this case, since
trust has been noted by various actors as well as trust is one of the new key elements
under NPG.
4
Findings and Implications
NPM had introduced collaborative government and co-production in public service
delivery. NPG concepts explain the conditions of the stakeholders involved in these
processes.
From the description above mentioned of projects under Smart City and Smart
Community, and of the Japanese e-Government policy and strategy, it is possible to
draw various observations.
First, the current Smart City and Smart Community projects are still in a too early
stage to understand the very intention of the government as well as municipalities.
However, from the materials of METI, it is rather clear that the original policy of Smart
City and Smart Community is the economic stimuli, considering that the investment
related to the projects might boost industrial activities in the territories. The fact, that
the private companies in the territories, and major energy, telecom, and IT companies
are involved from the very early stage of the projects, means that the Ministry was mostly
keen on the creation of new industry through the projects. This process has been typical
to the Ministry; it is well known that the high-tech industry had beneﬁted mostly from
these policies [36].
Second, the major part of the current projects regards on energy, especially on energy
saving and creation of new energy sources. City planning and building management are
part of this energy saving strategy. The latter was launched before these projects, mostly
by local governments. Building energy management was sought to save urban energy
consumption, at least to rationalise it. At territorial level, energy saving strategy was
introduced by private companies, including developers and building companies.
However these projects remained isolated ones, without broader strategy for the
community. Then the Smart City and Smart Community projects included these expe‐
riences into its policy and have been successfully applied in many foreign projects. After
the Earthquake, this tendency became more evident, although projects in the area of
earthquake have little to do with energy saving.
Third, in terms of ICT use in the territory, the Smart City and Smart Community
projects have realised little until now. They included intelligent traﬃc management
system and EVs in the original projects; however these are only on a very early stage.
Co-design, Co-creation, and Co-production of Smart Mobility System

Forth, it is interesting to note that the various projects related to ICT have initiated
by diﬀerent ministries and have been poorly coordinated. Major ICT projects in central
and local governments have been promoted by MIC (Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs and
Communications); meanwhile ICT industry related projects have been promoted by
METI. They were independently initiated and although many projects had similar char‐
acteristics, they are not coordinated among themselves. It is possible to observe typical
sectionalism among ministries, which is one of the obstacles for integrated ICT policy
development in Japan.
Lastly, the Smart Community in Kitakyushu, in particular, has revealed interesting
features: behaviour change of the residents in energy consumption, while they show
little participation. The case, given the historical peculiarity of the territory, could be an
interesting case to study trust among institutions and its impact on participation and
behaviour change.
The pattern of participation can be explained by the focus of Japanese smart cities
on energy issues, and by Japanese society’s traditional characteristics that seem to be
favourable to co-production of public services. However, since the experimentation only
started in 2012, it is still unclear whether these practices will be maintained in the long
term. Furthermore, the limitation of the area, the number of residents involved and the
peculiarity of Kitakyushu city do not enable to contend that citizens would be that much
cooperative in other contexts. Nevertheless, although this article does not aim at
providing generalisable conclusions about participation in smart cities, the fact that
citizen involvement shows similar characteristics in other Smart Communities as well
support the idea that Kitakyushu’s case is far for being unique. Accordingly, other smart
city projects may dram lessons from Kitakyushu Smart Community. Especially, it
underlines the importance of the trust factor, which is precisely one of the new key
elements under NPG, for the participation of citizens to the energy management co-
production.
Furthermore, another ambition of this article is to highlight that it is better to be
cautious with “citizen participation” claims when it comes to smart cities. The smart
grid technologies Smart Communities rely on are at the core of smart city projects
throughout the world. Therefore, the fact that smart cities may mobilise ICT to steer
citizens rather than to catalyse public participation calls for further research. Indeed, the
Japanese case suggests an interlocking between the rise of smartness and the emergence
of a “behaviour change agenda” based on the use of behavioural sciences and big data.
In this regard, citizen involvement in smart cities may be considered as a disciplinary
strategy [37] and seen as a means rather than as an end in itself; in other words, as a
policy instruments aiming at improving eﬃciency rather than deepening democracy.
Although already underlined by the literature [21], the ambiguous relation between co-
production and governmental approaches to behaviour change would deserve further
analysis when ICT is at stake.
Since the characteristics of co-design, co-creation, and co-production with citizen in
Smart Cities are similar to those of mobility system, the involvement of pedestrians and
drivers are essential as well as inevitable, although there are theoretical as well as prac‐
tical diﬃculties. The implication to mobility system needs to be analysed through case
studies.

Abstract. In human-computer interaction studies, an interaction is
often considered as a kind of information or discrete internal states of an
individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner from people to
computing interfaces (or robotic interfaces) and vice-versa [5,17].
This project aims to investigate processes capable of communicating
and cooperating by adjusting their schedules to match the evolving exe-
cution circumstances, in a way that maximise the quality of their joint
activities. By enabling human-computer interactions, the process will
emerge as a framework based on the concept of expectancy, demand,
and need of the human and computer together, for understanding the
interplay between people and computers.
The idea of this work is to utilise touch feedback from humans as a
channel for communication thanks to an artiﬁcial sensitive skin made of
a thin, ﬂexible, and stretchable material acting as transducer. As a proof
of concept, we demonstrate that the ﬁrst prototype of our artiﬁcial sen-
sitive skin can detect surface contacts and show their locations with an
image reconstructing the internal electrical conductivity of the sensor.

Introduction
Over the last two decades, touch screen technologies used as industrial control
panels have gained considerable interest with the evolution of smart materi-
als and digital products. The drawback is that this scenario is emphasising the
separateness between human and computer by treating them as disassociated
entities. For example, capacitive touch screens do not work unless the user is
working with bare hands or with particular gloves with a conductive yarn that
allows an electric charge. Consequently, the challenges of having a portable touch
screen which resolves the problem of the costs, hand occupation, and productiv-
ity, are still hounding the industries. For these reasons, the demand for eﬀective
human-computer interaction technology has increased.

Humanistic Intelligence theory states that the user and the computer are
not two separate entities but they work together having the human in the feed-
back loop of the computational process. In this case, the user takes advantage
of the augmented sensing modalities and additional senses oﬀered by the com-
puter [14] which is a continuously running and always-ready interface. It is then
clear that sensing elements are key factors in human-computer interaction. They
signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the system which is expected to intel-
ligently perform in changing surroundings and to be more responsive to human
commands. Such way of implementing a new type of man and sensory-machine
interface technology has facilitated and opened up an interaction that can be
easily accessed by the user. This is going to be beneﬁcial and leading to a new
form of synergy between human and computer when compared to the hand-held
devices [13] usually used in industrial scenarios.
One solution for smart sensing in HCI which has recently been addressed,
is the use of small sensor accessories as wearable technologies [15], monitoring
physiological, environmental and activity parameters of people as well for reha-
bilitation, sport [6,12,19], etc. The meaning of this rise is that there is the need
for sensors to be functional, ergonomic, stretchable and operative at high strains
without being obstructive. Previous approaches in stretchable sensors include,
for example, a soft sensor ﬂesh for whole body tactile sensor system [24], or
serpentine-like channels within an elastomeric matrix forming a network that
is used like a keypad [10]. These devices are ﬂexible but suﬀer from fragility,
because they are made of rigid sensing materials embedded in a soft substrate
creating stiﬀness and risking the material failure. Furthermore, they present
wires within the active sensing area that limits the overall deformation and can-
not guarantee that the sensor itself is going to take the shape of the support
where it is mounted on. These critical limitations hinder their integration for
artiﬁcial skin purposes.
To address these limits, in this paper we explore how an Electrical Impedance
Tomography (EIT) based stretchable pressure sensor can be utilised as a multi-
touch screen interfacing system for industrial control applications. The sensor
is ﬂexible and stretchable, capable of covering natural curved or ﬂat shapes
and it is used to measure forces applied by dragging or pinching interactions.
If mounted on the forearm of a wearer, the output of the sensor can be used
to generate a feedback in order to connect by local communication the machine
systems and the users in an industrial environment, improving the productivity
and ﬂexibility of the worker and decreasing pressure towards automation. The
sensing method employed is based on our observation that EIT can be used to
measure the changes in electrical resistivity inside a stretchable and electrical
conductive material; this is done by injecting several small currents and mea-
suring the resulting voltage at the boundary of the conductive medium [18] as
shown in Fig. 1. The injection and the measurement is repeated until every elec-
trode has received a current injection; in this way, by scanning around various
driving electrode pairs, the measured voltage data are then processed applying
an imaging technique, and an image of the conductivity inside the domain is

showed through an inverse solution of Maxwell’s equations. With an electrical
conductive, homogeneous, and stretchable material as a conductive medium, an
intuitive and wearable interface can be achieved and used as an industrial con-
troller without altering the original shape of the object where it is placed. Other
applications cover the majority of the domains where a soft and stretchable pres-
sure sensor is required, e.g. robotics, capturing human kinematics, pressure-sore
prevention [7,9], industrial automation and manufacturing. This will bring to the
development of an unobtrusive device that does not interfere with the users, and
helps them to become familiar with the task and accomplish intended goals on
the target application. The remainder of the paper will be organized describing
an overview of tactile sensors and EIT-based systems. Then a speciﬁc section will
describe the experimental set-up, data acquisition and reconstruction technique.
Discussion and conclusions will be presented in the last sections.

Sensitive Skin Based on EIT
2.1
Inverse Solution and Image Reconstruction
EIT works minimising the diﬀerence between experimentally measured bound-
ary voltages and an analytical forward operator that predicts these boundary
voltages simulating the same injection and measurement process that produced
them [20]. The approach used is the output least squares, that minimises the
sum of squares error:
min(||Vm −F(σ)||2),
(1)

566
S. Russo et al.
where Vm is a vector of experimentally measured voltages, F(.) is the forward
operator, and σ is the conductivity distribution that has to be reconstructed.
This is done considering an initial estimation of the conductivity σ0 and by
linearising F with the Taylor series expansion and substituting in (1):
∂(V ) ≈J∂σ + w.
(2)
The term ∂V is the diﬀerence between two voltage set measurements, w is the
noise, and J is a sensitivity matrix called Jacobian which represents how the
voltage across the electrodes is related to the change in electrical conductivity
within the conductive medium when current is applied. For solving this equation,
the EIT system is expressed trough Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism,
assuming for simplicity that we are using a direct current or at a suﬃciently low
frequency so the magnetic ﬁeld can be neglected. Our system Ω is modelled with
conductivity σ and a smooth (or smooth enough) boundary ∂Ω and completed
with the boundary equations. Diﬀerent types of models which can be used; in
this work we applied the complete electrode model [7]:
σ∇φ · n = 1
zl
(Vl −φ)
(3)

σ∇φ · n ∂Ω = 0,
(4)
where the unicity of the solution is provided considering the conservation of
charge theorem, assuming a voltage drop due to contact impedance between
the electrodes and Ω, and the total current through the electrodes which is
zero. Our model is then transformed from its continuous form into a discrete
approximation by ﬁnite elements with the Finite Element Method. In this way,
knowing the applied current and the conductivity distribution, the resulting
boundary potentials of the object can be simulated. The Jacobian J is then
found by perturbing the conductivity of the elements of the mesh and then
calculating the changes in potential at the electrodes.
For the nature of the calculation, some terms in the Jacobian matrix will
have small values. This becomes an ill-conditioned problem as the solution will
show an undesired tendency of amplifying noise, being very sensitive to small
changes in the measured potentials. This problem is solved by approximating
the solution through regularisation. In this work, the Tikhonov regularisation
method is shown but other approaches based on the singular value decomposition
(SVD) exist. In the Tikhonov regularisation, the ill-posed problem is solved
through minimisation of the least-square function, as explained in [11]:
Trough regularisation, the dynamic time-varying distribution of conductivity
changes as:
δσ = (JT J + α2Q)−1(JT )
(5)
where α is a scalar hyperparameter that controls the amount of regularisation
(e.g. the smaller is α, the more the solution tends to be ill-posed) and Q is found

Towards the Development of an EIT-based Stretchable Sensor
567
from a regularisation matrix that controls the assumption of smoothness of the
reconstructed σ. The regularisation matrix is commonly chosen between diﬀer-
ent regularisation methods [18], while the hyperparameter α is usually chosen
heuristically. When the system is modelled, the Jacobian and the parameters
needed for its solution are computed only once and oﬀ-line. Then, the current
injection starts and, at every step, two diﬀerent sets of measured boundary volt-
ages are compared for the diﬀerence imaging. This is done in a loop that allows
real-time implementation of the system. High reconstruction rates are reported
in literature [21–23].
2.2
Artiﬁcial Sensitive Skin Fabrication
The electrical conductive material used in EIT techniques is one of the main
component of this method. Diﬀerent materials have been used in previous works.
In [8,20] the authors have used polymers/rubbers with conductive micro-ﬁllers,
but the results are very dependent on the current path formed by the nanoﬁllers
inside the ﬂexible matrix when the material is stretched or compressed, thus cre-
ating a non-homogeneous conductivity distribution. In [16], a knit fabric sprayed
with a water-based carbonic paint is presented with conductivity changes in the
horizontal plane due to stretching. Chossat et al. [3] developed a tactile sensor
by using a silicone rubber containing microchannels ﬁlled with conductive ionic
liquid. The experimental results showed that in their prototype the spatial reso-
lution depends on the density of the conductive channel in the soft matrix. In [2]
two diﬀerent layers of conductive fabric are used. The materials responds in dif-
ferent ways to stretching and pressure thus eliminating changes in conductivity
due to one of the two stimuli.
We decided to choose a Medtex 130 conductive knit fabric, with the aim of
using it as a wearable touch sensor. It is a silver-plated highly conductive nylon
that is stretchable in both directions; this material is light-weight, low cost,
and with homogeneous conductivity and surface resistivity ≤1 ohm/sq. Unfor-
tunately, the material also gives changes in its conductivity due to stretching
while the main idea of this work is to have a pressure sensor. Being this study
a proof of concept we will focalise more on the experimental setup itself and
on the ﬁrst simulation and experimental results, while leaving the study of dif-
ferent materials to future works. As we are working with diﬀerence imaging,
the changes in conductivity due to the pre-stretching of the conductive textile
are not considered. The material was cut in a circular shape with a diameter of
10 cm. The calculated surface resistance was around 40 Ω. Stainless Steel circular
button electrodes were pierced into the sample with a 3.5 cm gap in between as

to decrease the sensitivity to stretching in the vertical axis when pressure is
applied.

Proposed Electrical Impedance Tomography Method
The conductive medium requires a constant DC current generator capable of
producing a constant current independent of the load to which it is connected.
The circuit is supplied with 5 V for the portability of the system. Considering the
resistivity of the sample material, the circuit is able to supply a constant current
of 14–16 mA without saturation of the used Op-Amp with a maximum allowed
connected load of 100 Ω. For the multiplexed voltage readings, the National
Instruments PCI6071E data acquisition (DAQ) board has been used. This is a
multifunction E Series card and, for input signal ranges between 0 to +200 mV
as in our case, the precision in the measurement is 48.8 µV. The DAQ has been
used in diﬀerential mode using two analog input lines. One line connects to
the positive input of the device programmable gain instrumentation ampliﬁer
(PGIA), and the other connects to the negative input of the PGIA, with low
settling times at all gains, ensuring to use the maximum resolution of the ADC.
Diﬀerently from previous works [4], we did not use two multiplexers for the volt-
age readings, thus decreasing the electrical noise and the settling time. For the
control of the current supply we mounted two 8-channels Analog Devices mul-
tiplexers. One of the two multiplexers was used for connecting one electrode to
the current source, while the other one was used to connect the second electrode
to the ground during the current injection process. With 8 channels, we used 3
control variables plus an enabling variable for every multiplexer, all controlled
by the National Instrument PCI 6704 board that generates the control variables
as output voltages, and the supply voltage for the multiplexers and the constant
current generator. A voltage of 5 V was used as power supply in order to bring

this ﬁrst prototype as a portable system in future studies. For the management
of the control and acquisition card we have used a Simulink platform to cre-
ate a veriﬁcation algorithm and synchronization of the inputs and outputs. In
Simulink, we used Real Time Windows Target that provides a real-time kernel
for executing the model; we chose a sample time for the voltage readings of
200 Hz and selected the input and output channels for the current injection. The
ﬁrst tests were conducted using the adjacent stimulation method for the current
injection and measurement pattern due to its well-known use in EIT literature.
Voltage measurements were acquired also from the drive electrodes, but then
removed via software for eliminating most of the noise and errors due to contact
impedance mismatch. The voltage measurement were then sent to EIDORS soft-
ware [1] for the image reconstruction. This software platform is available under
a General Public License and is used for the forward and inverse modelling of
EIT. It also creates a FE model of the conductive medium (Fig. 3), and trough
an inverse analysis it reconstructs the image of the internal conductivity of the
material, assigning a value of the changes in conductivity for every node of the
FE model. This is done based on the voltage dataset acquired once a complete
set of currents has been injected.

Results and Discussion
4.1
Simulation Studies
Before conducting the experiments a simulation of the expected results was
carried out in EIDORS. The FE mesh is constructed using the Medtex 130
physical sample as a reference. A uniform mesh density function was chosen and
eight electrodes were selected and modelled to coincide with the physical setup.

570
S. Russo et al.
The current injection and voltage measurement patterns were deﬁned as well as
the current amplitude. A value for the hyperparameter α of 0.5 was chosen for
controlling the smoothness of the solution and the regularisation matrix was also
selected at this stage. As illustrated in Fig. 4, a mesh of our conductive material
was constructed and a simulated load was applied in the central area of the mesh
through a change in conductivity, in order to generate the expected reconstructed
image. This is done by setting up via software the current stimulation pattern and
calculating the resulting voltage on each element of the mesh through a forward
solver. Based on this, EIDORS recreates the conductivity of the elements in the
mesh and generates an image of the reconstructed conductivity.
Fig. 4. Figure: On the left, a 3 cm diameter change in conductivity is simulated in the
centre of the EIT model and the reconstructed image is shown on the right. It is visible
that the simulated applied pressure has an inﬂuence on the conductivity changes in
the pressure area and its proximity.

Experimental Results: Contact Location and Image
Reconstruction
A conductive 250gr load (2.5 N) of 3 cm diameter was placed over the pressure
sensitive sensor to see the results of the applied pressure. Diﬀerential voltage
readings of about 100 mV were acquired with the DAQ card and sent to EIDORS
for the image reconstruction. Voltage measurements taken from the electrodes
carrying current were then removed via software. As shown in Fig. 5, the sensor
was able to recognise the applied load through a change in the conductivity. The
reconstructed image presents a blurred area near the area of pressure: this is due
to the chosen material that has high hysteresis and high response to stretching,
as expected. Also, the accuracy and resolution of the reconstructed image depend

on the regularisation methods, the choice of the hyperparameter, the accuracy of
the electrode placement, and the presence of the electrical noise. Furthermore, by
increasing the number of electrodes the resolution can be improved, as already
explained in [18].

Conclusion
The goal of this paper was to develop the proof-of-concept of an EIT-based
stretchable sensor for wearable touch screens which can be a key feature for
enabling safe and eﬀective human-computer interaction in industrial applica-
tions. We introduced the EIT technique to estimate the internal conductivity
of a conductive stretchable medium based on the voltage data acquired from
its boundary. The complete absence of wires inside the internal structure of the
sensor allows it to be stretchable and easily placed on 3D shaped surfaces. Also,
as we have used a diﬀerence imaging method, only the conductivity changes with
respect to an initial baseline are shown, meaning that the initial changes due
to the pre-stretching are not crucial in the application of the sensor. We have
developed an experimental set-up with a constant 14 mA DC current genera-
tor, two multiplexers for the current injection and a DAQ card for the voltage
readings. Experimental results shown herein demonstrate a good match with
the simulation studies conducted in EIDORS. Future studies will focus on the
development of a real-time setup and on the study of diﬀerent materials and
diﬀerent types of current injection and voltage measurements for the integration
of the sensor in a portable and wearable pressure-sensitive touch screen.

Abstract. Each person has his own personal feature which includes physical,
physiological, psychological and cognitive characteristics. Kansei, i.e., affection,
is a mechanism which characterizes each person’s mental and behavioral pro-
cesses interacting with the world. In this mechanism, multimedia and multi-
modal information from other people, objects and environment are received
physically and physiologically through the ﬁve senses related to his age, gender
and body conditions. The information is interpreted subjectively to its psy-
chological and cognitive images associated with his personal preference,
experiences, knowledge and cultural background. Some decisions are made
based on his purpose of actions and his lifestyle. Then, speciﬁc behaviors, such
as verbal and non-verbal responses, are activated and shown to the other people,
objects and environment. “Kansei” is an important perspective for understand-
ing personal preferences and giving suitable assistance to each person. This
perspective is supported by the human-centered science and technology of
“kansei engineering.” This paper proposes the framework of Kansei modeling
through unconscious behavior in interaction in living space to provide safe and
stress-free living space.

Introduction
Ubiquitous, mobile and wearable networks uniﬁed on the internet are rapidly
embedded into our daily living sphere. That means people, unfamiliar to information
technology and human computer interaction issue, are becoming a large part of the
users of the uniﬁed information environment. Thus we need a new concept of infor-
mation environment design which does not force a person to have and use any com-
puter skills to manage his living space in safe and stress-free. Such an information

environment would provide modest and human friendly manner for users including
elderly people.
Information assistance services are mostly based on social recommendation by
collaborative ﬁltering of huge number of logs of many consumers, which do not cover
the differences of personal taste of each consumer. To perform personalized informa-
tion assistance we need effective method for collecting decision-making data of each
person with various kinds of objects without forcing prompted interactions with
electronic gadgets.
This paper introduces a concept of Kansei mechanism and its modeling method
through unconscious interaction with uniﬁed information environment.

Kansei Modeling
Subjective feature of each user’s requirement in information service can be schemat-
ically summarized as following [1];
(1) Intuitive perception process: A user may receive some impressions viewing
objects. We assume such a process as physical, physiological, psychological and
cognitive levels of interpretation. In this process, a portion of the graphical fea-
tures of an object, such as its colors and their combination, textures and shape, is a
dominant factor in his intuitive perception. We can statistically model these
relationships between some graphical features of objects and their interpretations
[2, 3].
(2) Subjective interpretation of situations: A user may show his intentional choice of
assistance services according to his situation, such as time, place and occasion.
Even if people physically sharing the same time, place, and occasion, each of
them may feel different impression and may expect to receive different assist
according to his life style and physical conditions. We assume such a process as
physical, bottom-up multiple interpretation and top-down assistance-based levels
of interpretation. We can model these relationships by statistical behavior log
analysis.
(3) Knowledge structure of service domain: Novice users may only have restricted
knowledge on a service domain, while the others have much and well organized.
Such a difference means each user is expecting his own answer according to his
knowledge base in his mind. We can formalize this kind of knowledge structure as
ontology. We are also relating subjective concepts on feeling with some graphical
features of objects.
(4) Feature of behavior pattern: A user often shows some speciﬁc behavior uncon-
sciously according to his interest (or stress) on something; for instance, if he is
interested in some goods, he often watches, touches and grasps them uncon-
sciously to have a closer look at them. Thus, we can statistically analyze a degree
of interest on objects by each person’s behavior log [4–6].
(5) Tendency of decision making process: A person often makes his own decision
pattern according to his view of life, which is originate from his intuitive per-
ception process of objects and subjective interpretation process of situations,

which is compared with his knowledge base in his mind, and which cause the
difference in his behavior pattern in taking an action.
We can schematically summarize such relationships as shown in Fig. 1.

Personal Assistance Service Using Ubiquitous Environment
3.1
Kansei Modeling on Personal Preferences: Smart Sphere
Information assistance services, e.g., recommendation services, are mostly based on
social recommendation by collaborative ﬁltering of huge number of shopping logs of
many consumers, which do not cover the differences of personal taste of each con-
sumer. Otherwise a user has to register his preferring items which are referred as a

template of the user’s model. Such systems force their users to answer a huge number
of questionnaires to describe the individual preferences. These make users feel much
stress in information assistance service.
Our basic ideas are (1) to ﬁnd user’s interested and/or preferred items through
observation on his behaviors in ubiquitous information environment, (2) to automati-
cally build his preference model, and (3) to apply the model to provide suitable
information service in the real world [9].
3.2
Micro, Mezzo and Macroscopic Observation
Utilizing ubiquitous sensors, we apply three observation methods to modeling each
user’s preferences, which are micro, mezzo and macroscopic observation methods as
shown in Fig. 2.
(A) Microscopic view identiﬁes a user by his ID tag as well as detects eye tracks by
his facial image and some handling motions on some item by locally equipped
cameras.
(B) Macroscopic view covers a location of each person in a room by a matrix of
global view cameras equipped on the ceiling. It also covers the overall spatial
allocation and density of the people as well as the items in the room.
(C) Mezzoscopic view extracts and traces each person’s locations and behaviors as
time series data both from microscopic and macroscopic views. It also manages
personal behavior log database.
3.3
Indirect Interaction in Active Observation
To enforce answering a huge number of questionnaires on users is a bottleneck in
modeling personal preferences. One idea is just taking their behavior log via ubiquitous
sensors without asking them, and mining some speciﬁc features by statistical analysis.
Such a method is called passive observation. The problem of this method is to require
long time and huge personal log to cover enough behavior data.
Our idea is to show several messages to each user, i.e., applying active observation,
without expecting direct answers. If a message is informative and interesting to a user,
he may pay attention, gaze, and follow the suggestion according to the message. In this
process he is freely behaving by his intention without feeling any enforcement to
answer to the system. In this case, monitoring each user’s behavior, i.e., responses to
the messages, via ubiquitous sensors enables to attain enough behavior data effectively.
This method corresponds to indirect interaction in active observation. The system can
throw suitable and controlled messages to a user to build up his precise preference
model without putting any stress on him. Thus, the system can statistically analyze a
degree of interest on objects by each person’s behavior log effectively without a huge
number of questionnaires.

Experimental Prototype: Smart Shop
In the business ﬁeld, ﬁnding consumers’ preferences is an important issue. Point of
sales systems are popularly used to detect the current consumers’ preferences as well as
store management.
We have been developing an experimental prototype system, Smart Shop, as
typical application of personal information assistance in shopping context [7].
(1) Microscopic view devices: Each shelf is equipped with (a) an RFID tag reader to
identify each consumer around there, (b) a facial camera to detect his face
direction, (c) several item cameras to detect his behaviors related to the items,
such as touching, grasping and wearing, and (d) several LCD monitors to show
personal messages to him as well as to show public messages to the consumers.
(2) Macroscopic view devices: The ceiling of the shop is equipped with camera array
to cover whole area without occlusion to detect a location of each consumer at
each time slice.
(3) Smart shop servers: We have three types of database servers; which are (a) mi-
croscopic information servers to detect each behavior of the customer by image
processing with his customer-ID by an RFID reader at each shelf, (b) a macro-
scopic server to integrate location data of consumers’ from camera array by image
processing at each time slice, (c) a mezzoscopic server to integrate personal
behavior log data from microscopic servers and macroscopic server and to
manage the behavior log database, (d) a preference model server to statistically
analyze each customer’s preferences from each of his behavior logs and to
manage preference model database, and (e) a recommendation server to assist a
customer in shopping.
We can expect that the consumer’s preference may appear his behavior; for
instance, the order “grasp > touch > watch > ignore” shows his interest. Our
assumption is that we can construct his preference model on items by behavior
analysis.
Nevertheless we should note that we cannot directly estimate consumer’s prefer-
ence form a single behavior itself. It should be evaluated all through his behavior log. It
is because “shopping style” is roughly classiﬁed into two types; direct shopping type
and survey type. For the former type, even a single touch shows a strong interest, while
for the latter, a single touch is just one of them.
The system functions are as following;
(1) If a customer comes to a shelf, its microscopic server is activated and senses his
RFID to identify.
(2) If he is interested in an item, he may stay there for a while to watch. If he is more
interested in it, he may also touch and grasp it to have a closer look at it. Such a
sequence can be detected by the ubiquitous cameras in the space. Thus, his
personal behavior log is accumulated into the smart shop personal behavior log
database.
578
T. Sakamoto et al.

(3) By statistical analysis on the frequency and total elapsed time of watch, touch and
grasp of each item, we can judge the shopping style and ﬁnally estimate the
preference of the consumer on the items in the shop.
Through this process and iteration, the system can build up and update each cus-
tomer’s preference model without forcing him to answer huge questionnaires.

Experiments for Kansei Modeling
5.1
Estimation of Dominant Attributes
We adopt conjoint analysis as to ﬁnd the dominant attributes [8]. The sample products
for the method are provided based on an orthogonal array. We analyze these products
with quantiﬁcation methods 1. The explanatory variables are the product attributes and
the response variables are the degree of taste to the products estimated by the Smart
Shop. As the result of the multiple regression analysis, the maximum |t| value of each
attributes are considered as the degree of dominant attributes and the maximum degree
is considered as the best dominant attribute.
5.2
Method of Recommendation Considering Dominant Attributes
The Smart Shop recommends products based on each customer’s taste when they stand
in front of a digital signage device. They are recommended by order having high score
as follows:
Scorep ¼
X
ða;vÞ2p
Va  Sv  Da
S  Nv
;
where p, a, and v are a product, an attribute, and an attribute value. Va is a number of
total attribute values the attribute a has. Sv is a number of times a customer chose
products which has the attribute value v. Da is a degree of dominant attributes of the
attribute a. S is a total number of times a customer chose products. Nv is a number of
products which have attribute value v. The taste degrees of each attribute value are
obtained by Da and the number of times a customer chose v. The scores of each product
p are obtained by the total of the taste degree of each attribute falling under p.
We conducted an experiment to compare our implicit method by Smart Shop and
previous explicit one by questionnaire. Subjects were 4 male students. The process is as
follows:
1. A subject did shopping in Smart Shop. The products were 18 t-shirts selected
randomly. The Smart Shop analyzed the subject’s action data and estimated a
formula of subject’s action pattern.
2. The subject also did shopping in the Smart Shop. However the products were 18
t-shirts selected based on an orthogonal table. The Smart Shop estimated the taste
degree of products and the degree of dominant attributes based on the action pattern
formula.

3. The subject answered survey questions to evaluate the preference to the products
with ﬁve phases (+2, +1, 0, −1, −2). We also estimated the degree of dominant
attributes based on the answer.
4. Each recommendation products of the Smart Shop and the questionnaire data
obtained by the degree of dominant attributes. Digital signage devices showed ﬁve
of them based on the subject action for products. The subject evaluated the pref-
erence to the ﬁve recommendation products with ﬁve phases. This recommendation
step was repeated 3 times and we got 15 product evaluations in total.
5.3
Active Observation for Quick Modeling of Dominant Attributes
In order to adopt active observation, we need stepwise estimation of preferred attributes
through the temporal behavior log. In our experiment, we have simply applied rough
set analysis to ﬁgure out the common attributes with column score and column index
among items rather strongly interacted as “look,” “touch” and “take” actions.
According to the highest attributes at each step, the system shows explanation
message through a digital signage concerning the interacting item at the moment. If
some attribute is important to the speciﬁc customer, such an attribute and its value
enables him to decide the value for him, which strengthen the user’s model. Otherwise
the system reduces the score and index values of the attribute and its value for him.

Current Results and Discussions
6.1
Evaluation of Recommendation Method Considering Dominant
Attributes
Table 1 shows the rates which evaluations estimated by Smart Shop have matched with
user-given estimated values in questionnaire. The evaluations were divided into likes
and dislikes. We separated into two cases; “like” and “dislike”. Here, the estimation
value 0 in the answer to a questionnaire may differ for each user. The estimation
accuracies of subject A and B were more than 61 % in both case, however, it of subject
C and D were less than 50 % in case that 0 is likes.
Table 2 shows the degree of dominant attributes estimated by Smart Shop or with
questionnaire. The dominant attribute estimated by Smart Shop were matched with
another estimated with questionnaire about subject A and B. Particularly about subject
A, the order of dominance were also matched with another. The decimal place’s
difference about subject B suggests that Smart Shop can estimate the degree of dom-
inant attributes more correctly than questionnaire. However, the dominant attributes of
2 methods were matched about subject C and D. These results may be caused by Smart
Shop’s estimation or questionnaire.
Table 3 shows the ratio which subjects liked the recommended products. All
subject’s results were more than 60 %. The results suggest Smart Shop with this
study’s method can provide stable satisfaction to each subject.
580
T. Sakamoto et al.

Recommended Products for subject A and B by Smart Shop were the same as
another by questionnaire because both estimated dominant attributes were the same. On
the other hand, those for subject C and D were not the same as another. Subject C rated
the products recommended by Smart Shop less by 30 % than another although subject
D rated them more by 6.7 %. These results indicate the need for review of the action
pattern formula by Smart Shop.
Therefore we reviewed and optimized the action pattern formula of all subjects to
maximize adjusted R-square. Some of the formulas have had unnecessary variables.
Table 4 shows the degree of dominant attributes estimated with optimized formulas
of Smart Shop. The optimized formula of subject C made his dominant attributes,
estimated by Smart Shop, agree with another by questionnaire. Those of subject A, B

and D were not changed. We can consider the product recommendation by Smart Shop
is able to satisfy subject C well as another by questionnaire.
Finally, these results presented Smart Shop with our method attained implicit
estimation of dominant attributes in 3 of 4 subjects. These also presented that, in the
case of estimated dominant attributes by Smart Shop and another by questionnaire did
not ﬁt, it satisﬁed a subject better than modeling by questionnaire.
6.2
Evaluation of Active Observation for Quick Modeling of Dominant
Attributes
In our current experiment in order to simplify the experiment process, the importance
values of each item is directly assigned by the user. Step by step, the system updates
estimated importance of attribute and its value and shows explanatory information on
the display.
By the passive observation method, we needed randomly selected 200 items to
build each user’s preference model on attribute and its value in 80 % precision. By
adopting active observation, we needed randomly selected only 60 items to build the
same precision model. That shows the efﬁciency of the active observation. If the
method is adopted with the passive observation mechanism in Smart Shop, it reduces
the user’s stress during behavior log acquisition and information recommendation as
well.

Concluding Remarks
This paper proposed a concept of KANSEI modeling from the aspects of users’ needs
in information service. The key issue is to computationally describe human information
processing process from these aspects; (1) intuitive perception process, (2) subjective
interpretation of their situations, (3) knowledge structure of service domain, (4) feature
of behavior pattern, and (5) decision making process. We should notice that these
aspects are in the same framework of modeling in robotics ﬁeld.
As a typical example of this idea, we had shown the estimation method of product
dominant attributes for each customer through behavior observation in a retail store.

Abstract. Smart Car Services refer to a rich variety of services for drivers or
passengers that are brought to people in recent years through mobile Internet, car-
to-car network, IOT, big data, and other technologies. Because of their relation‐
ship with cutting-edge technology, most of them are original by nature, and there
lacks clear approaches for the design of this type of services. Based on the study
of existing services and our own design practices, we propose in this paper two
general approaches that together covers the majority of the space of smart car
service innovation. We further proposed three perspectives to look at smart car
services along with corresponding design methods for each of them. We also
exemplify in detail the approaches and methods using our own design cases.

Introduction
With the development of digital technology, cars are acquiring more and more func‐
tionalities of mobile electronic devices rather than only as a tool for transportation. More
and more services can now be developed to bring convenience to people’s driving or
riding of cars. We call in this paper this type of services brought to us by new technol‐
ogies as smart car services. Currently, most of the eﬀorts in smart car service design are
either falling into individual application directions, such as car rental [3, 8, 10], or
focused on the utilization of a speciﬁc technology, such as OBD [1, 4, 9]. There lacks
an overall framework to help designers envision varieties of innovative services. We
thus propose in this paper the Connected and Open Platform-Based approaches, which
together construct a 3D coordinates for exploring diﬀerent possibilities in smart car
service innovation. We will introduce in detail in the following sessions: (1) the 3D
framework formed by the two approaches, (2) three perspectives to interpret the concept
of Connected, and (3) how each of them could be further augmented through opening
up the data and control accessibility of a car to diﬀerent services. We also use three of
our design cases as examples to show how these approaches and associated methods
could help with the initiation of new services.

Connected and Open Platform-Based Approaches
People, Car, and Environment are three key components for constructing car services.
For smart car service, the People component can be further expanded to people’s digital
life, and the Environment component can include not only the physical but also the
digital environment encompassing people and cars. While delineating new car services,
one could think from the direction of linking cars with each other, linking cars with
people’s digital life, and linking cars with rich services and data available in the digital
environment. As illustrated in Fig. 1, this approach of connecting the key components
with each other helps to form a plane that could cover all the potential relationships. On
the other hand, for a speciﬁc car in the network, there are data at diﬀerent levels of
availability for the plane of service (e.g. entertainment information, environmental data,
driver data, car position, interior and ambient setting, vehicle status, driving control,
etc.). This could thus form another dimension perpendicular to the service plane and
suggest potential features based on the property of data at diﬀerent levels in sensing and
controlling a car. Together, these two dimensions cover an innovation space with both
the broadness of linking a car to all other types of components and the depth of sensing
and controlling a car at diﬀerent levels.
Fig. 1. The connected and open platform-based approaches
We here deﬁne those three types of linking a car to other components as the
“Connected” approach and will explain in detail the characteristics and design methods
of each type. For accessing the data and control of a car, it is normally through the “Open
Platform-Based” approach, in which car companies develop an open platform through
which third-party applications can sense and control a car to certain level. We will
explain in later session how this possibility of in-depth accessing of a car can augment
the possibilities brought by the “Connected” approach.

Three Perspectives for Interpreting the “Connected” Concept
The three ways of linking a car to other components in smart car service construction
are indeed three perspectives for interpreting the same trend of connecting. There are
thus overlaps in service features designed through each of them. However, they each
bring to us a unique entry point to tackle the same problem. A set of methods can also
be derived out corresponding to the characteristics of each of them.
3.1
Service Circle
When thinking from the angle of connecting a car to services and data available in the
digital environment, one could resort to a circular structure (as shown in Fig. 2) with the
car residing in the center and surrounded by the circles of services and shared data. The
construction process could start from the car, either as an active request for service sent
from the driver/passenger or as trigger for certain services based on information of the
car or the driver detected by the system. When the request or trigger hit the circle of
services, there could be one service respond to it (Fig. 2(b)), or multiple related services
respond in synergy (Fig. 2(c)). It is also possible that one service would resort to data
shared by other services and return to the user a more comprehensive and customized
service feature.
Fig. 2. The service circle
While designing through this process, it is important to go over all the possible
requests or triggers that could be sent or detected from the car, and then link them with
as many services and shared data on the circles as possible. After the driver or passenger
receives the feedback, this procedure could be repeated for requests or triggers in the
next steps. For example, when the driver or passenger in a car sends out the request to
look for a restaurant for lunch, we can connect it with one or multiple on-line restaurant
recommendation platforms, which could provide recommendations based on the car’s
location and the driver’s former preferences. They can also resort to allergic information
and dietary suggestion of the user shared by health-related platforms. After the restaurant
is decided from the user side, this information would further trigger more services such
as restaurant reservation, parking reservation, and recommendations for shopping in the
adjacent areas.

3.2
Service Line
With its ever increasing level of smartness, the car is no longer only a driving tool for
people, but is becoming a more and more important element in people’s digital life.
People may set the destination and turn on the AC of a car while at home, and may be
advised to adjust their route based on activities in their to-do-list. It is also possible to
have the AC at home turned on from the car on the driver’s way back home.
In order to help better sort out the service potentials in this context of digital life, we
propose to use a Service Line structure as coordinate to locate service features. As shown
in Fig. 3, the structure includes a Service Line, an Action Line, and a Location Line.
Since it is about people’s digital life, the design process starts from deﬁning the customer
journey map by scenario, such as daily activities during weekdays or activities before,
during and after traveling. For example, the journey map for daily activities may include
getting up, going to work, grabbing lunch and stopping by the grocery store after work,
etc. All the actions are then plotted on the Action Line by time. Considering of the fact
that cars are directly associated with journey in the physical world, for the design of car
services, a sequence of locations corresponding to the actions are further derived out
and plotted on the Location Line (Those at which people is in the car are plotted as ﬁlled
dots and those at which people is not with the car are plotted as circles). This Location
Line is then used as coordinate for the identiﬁcation of service features. Besides
designing services by directly associating with a key location (such as home, oﬃce,
restaurant, etc.), one could also consider the adjacent area of a key location (such as the
surrounding area of a shopping mall) and derive related services (such as parking space
reservation) when driving near the destination. It is also possible to identify on the
Location Line city districts passed through which have rich service potentials (such as
commercial districts) and deﬁne information push type of services that are not initiated
from the user action.
Fig. 3. The service line
Besides actions that could be plotted on the Action Line, there are also actions just
put on a to-do-list by the user. Those are considered as potential actions that don’t have
speciﬁc locations to associate with. When deriving service features, these potential
actions could be brought up at each location to see whether and how they could be
associated with the location under consideration. For example, if the user has added the
Connected and Open Platform-Based Approaches for Smart Car
587

action of purchasing milk to his/her to-do-list, we may add to the service the function
of reminding the user of the milk-purchasing task when he/she gets to a location with a
grocery store in the adjacent area.
3.3
Service Network
Connecting cars with each other is similar to the process of forming a social network
among them. We could thus carry out service design in this direction from in-depth study
of nodes on the network and from thorough analysis of relationships that could be formed
among them.
For the design of services, the node of a car could be looked at as a car by itself, or from
the point of view of the driver or passengers in the car. Further study could be carried out
over the information a car could provide and receive, the needs and behavior of the driver
and passengers, etc. This information can then serve as the starting point for the construc‐
tion of the service network. As shown in Fig. 4(a) connections could be formed between
cars, drivers, passengers, and even between a car and the driver or passengers in another
car. Designers could take social relationship (such as sharing, collaborating, game playing,
etc.) for reference when coming up with possible types of relations to form the network.
For example, cars could share sensorial data with each other for driving assistant purpose,
they could also collaboratively collect, report, and form maps of road condition, traffic
condition, etc. Drivers could share entertainment materials, sceneries, and traffic informa‐
tion with each other, they could seek help in the network when there are emergencies, they
could also form a temporary chatting group with near cars when there is a heavy traffic
jam. For passengers or even drivers, multi-player game, especially those associated with
traveling environment or driving history, could be envisioned to make the driving experi‐
ence more engaging. Designers could also take the social norms concept and apply it to the
“society” of cars. For example, the car of a driver with bad driving behavior record may
send out alert messages to near by cars (for ADAS or autonomous driving) or drivers
(Fig. 4).
Fig. 4. Service network (mark the relationship)
Besides taking social network for reference semantically, during the construction of the
network, the seven main topologies for computer networks (Fig. 4(b)) could also be taken
as syntactic reference. They can help the designers to get a clear understanding of the char‐
acteristics of each type of topology and organize the network more systematically.

Augmenting the Service Through “Open Platform”
Encouraging and supporting users or third party developers to participate in the design
and development of applications satisfying people’s everyday needs for car services is
a meaningful direction to go in order to bring to car applications the same level of
richness as mobile apps. Many car companies build their Open Platform to support users
to develop applications using the platform API and sense/control cars of their brand
through the Open Platform. There are also public platforms, such as OpenXC [7] and
CARGO [2], aiming at achieving the Apple Store eﬀect in an even bigger scope. By
installing their products, they enable users and developers to monitor data collected
through on-board sensors and to develop applications through their platforms. Of course,
for public platforms, to unlock hardware data, support and participation from auto‐
makers is very important. There are already platforms focusing on facilitating such
collaborations. The Open Automotive Alliance (OAA) [5] comprised of leading auto‐
makers and technology companies has the aim of creating in collaboration opportunities
for developers to deliver a more safe, intuitive, and seamless driving experience to users.
OpenCar [6] oﬀers API, toolset, and simulator for automakers, system integrators, and
software developers to build apps on a uniformed platform.
Both the eﬀorts by car manufactures and that by public platforms help to make
vehicle data accessible for third-party developers and enable the delivery of services
that would not be possible previously. People are now able to control car window, air
conditioner, lighting, audio system, and even car engine remotely. It is also possible to
intervening a car’s speed and direction under diﬀerent service conditions. For services
designed through the three types of “Connected” approaches introduced in the above
session, this Open Platform-Based approach could help to expand or augment them to
a broader scope and to a deeper level.
While designing through the Service Circle approach, from one side, there are more
types of data could be detected from the car, from the other side, the services we linked
to on the circle are now empowered with the capability to control the car. They can now
provide to the car functions not only in the form of information but also as actions taken
over the car. For example, designers can now envision the function of linking the recent
health data of a driver with the sensorial data of his/her current condition in the car and
alert the driver, surrounding passengers, and even the health service providers when
there are serious health conditions detected. The service can even stop the car remotely
if necessary.
When working with the Service Line structure, what was considered as one action
previously is now able to be split into multiple segments. Some of them, such as the
parking part in Fig. 3(b), can be conducted autonomously and others still under the
drivers’ control if they wish. Also, after splitting a combo action into small segments,
they can be linked to diﬀerent points on the Location Line. As shown in Fig. 3(a), setting
the destination, starting the AC, starting the engine, these three actions which are previ‐
ously part of the action of starting a car, are now able to take place when people are still
in their house.
For the Service Network of cars, when more data of a car are made available, the
communication among them could reach a deeper level. Services previously made up
Connected and Open Platform-Based Approaches for Smart Car
589

of car-to-car information sharing can also be expanded to include emergency alert or
other functions based on vehicle status data.
5
Design Cases
In a service system design project for recreational vehicles (RV), we followed the
approaches and methods introduced above explicitly, and achieved a system with func‐
tions of rich varieties and covering many dimensions. For recreational vehicles that are
supporting people’s touring, the perspective of linking a car to useful services and data
is an important direction to go. During the construction of the system, we ﬁrst integrated
Ma Feng Wo, a web platform for touring, to let users beneﬁt from all the touring services
it provides (touristic attractions, travel guide, travel program, hotels, ticket booking,
tourism product) in one stop. We also bring to users information and services unique
for traveling by recreational vehicles, such as information about the camping site, supply
station, and rescue team, and services for customized navigation, themed route planning,
route recommendation, RV community platform, and even RV radio station.
The perspective of linking cars with cars from their potential relationships also
played an important role in helping us constructing the social community and especially
the ﬂeet touring part of the system. Users could form teams before departure through
online platforms. One RV could also join a ﬂeet close by on their way of heading towards
the same destination. Diﬀerent vehicles in a ﬂeet can choose to play diﬀerent roles in a
team collaboration, e.g. head vehicle, tail vehicle, vehicle responsible to repairing, and
vehicle providing nursing service. The head vehicle can share with others road condi‐
tions or front view of the sceneries. The system could support mutual chatting among
all the vehicles in the ﬂeet and support passengers from diﬀerent vehicles to play games
together with each other.
The Open Platform-Based approach also inspired us to introduce to the system a set
of functions supporting the top-down management of all the vehicles belong to the plat‐
form. For example, the system could monitor hardware conditions of the vehicles,
remind the driver timely when there is any abnormal vehicle status detected, and contact
the nearest repairing and rescue site correspondingly. The system could also stop the
vehicle when they are detected getting close to dangerous zones or getting too far away
from the route they are suppose to take according to the rental contract.
Diﬀerent from the top-down utilization of Open Platform in the example above, we
experimented in another project the approach of assisting end users to make the most
out of this mechanism. We developed an App using the API provided by the Open
Platform of PSA to allow users to add IFTTT type of customized scenarios, e.g. turning
the air conditioner on when the temperature in the car is above 25 degree, turning on the
heater when temperature in the car is below 18 degree, switch the mode of ambient light,
music, and fragrance according to the weather outside and the time of the day, etc.
The perspective of connecting the car with one’s daily activities also inspired us in
inventing another smart service providing scenario-based automatic setting adjustment.
After the user synchronizes his/her personal schedule into the system, a sequence of
scenario key points will be generated along with appropriate settings of air conditioning,
590

music, lighting etc. according to the user’s previous preference. All the settings will be
executed over the journey to provide the user with a considering experience with smooth
transitions.

Conclusions
We propose in this paper the connected and open platform-based approaches in the
design of smart service for cars. Hope the analysis of the smart car services from the
three main perspectives and their corresponding methods of design could be helpful for
the invention of more innovative services. With the development of the technology,
there will be more tools help to connect a car with other cars and with diverse data and
services. More possibilities may also emerge in opening the data and control accessi‐
bility of a car to third-party applications, especially in the stage of autonomous or half-
autonomous driving. However, the Open aspect would worth further research regarding
driving safety, data security and many other issues. We will set this as the subject to
focus on as the next step, studying the level to which people would like to open the data
of their cars, under what conditions, and with what kind of expectation for return. This
could help delineate the balance line in inventing open platform-based services.

Abstract. Speciﬁc environment provides a certain type of functional services,
if we organize them in service design thinking, the services would be more
systematic, comprehensive and reasonable. This paper puts forward ESSD that
puts “Service” as core and essential mindset to construct the relationship among
components in the whole system. The concept of ESSD will be elaborated in this
paper in four steps: (1) Deﬁnition of ESSD; (2) What ESSD could do and how
does it work; (3) Diﬀerences with PSSD (Product Service System Design) and
its characteristics; (4) Characteristics of SESSD (Smart Environment Service
System Design) where “Smart” is both augmentation and new approach to design.

Introduction
Diﬀerent types of environments have their core functional services. When designing
architecture or space, designers usually take account of functions of the environment
while not apply systematic design and construction to the service itself [1]. If it were
possible for designers to design the functional services oﬀered by speciﬁc environment
from the perspective of service system, such as regarding hospital as a system for medical
and doctoring services, we would establish an overall and optimized service system for
diﬀerent stakeholders involved [2]. To get systematic environment-speciﬁc service
design approaches and mindset, in this paper we mainly put forward the concept of ESSD
(Environment Service System Design) that is designing systematically and comprehen‐
sively for certain functional services in a speciﬁc space, holding the essential mindset
of Service System Design, the process of ESSD. We also discuss about the diﬀerences
between ESSD and PSSD (Product Service System Design), unique characteristics of
ESSD, features of SESSD (Smart Service System Design) and their construction
thinking which is capable of rationalizing relationships among services in a speciﬁc
environment.

Working Principles of ESSD
ESSD is highly capable of helping eﬀectively organize and coherently sort out related
services of a speciﬁc environment. Usually a certain space is designed to arm with some
conditions so that to create functional services for meeting our needs; ESSD could help

us arrange all service components from fragments into a comprehensive entity in the
mindset of service design, and further establish a rational environment-speciﬁc service
system.
From the perspective of service design, ESSD takes overall account of each compo‐
nent in it: Firstly, ESSD makes several outlook visions for ﬁnal service with some tools
(e.g. mood board, positioning map, personas, etc.); then it settles down explicit service
scenarios, puts forward oﬀerings as many as possible and as detailed as possible, marks
out relevant stakeholders and touch points for corresponding oﬀerings. All oﬀerings
could be arranged into diﬀerent sub-systems. The division could be according to
management department, service type, property aﬃliation or other aspects. In each sub-
system map, stakeholders could be connected with main touch points by oﬀerings in
form of various ﬂow (information ﬂow, material ﬂow, ﬁnancial ﬂow, staﬀ ﬂow, etc.),
which makes relationship more understandable. Finally, a comprehensive system map
elaborates the overall structure, as well as user journey map developed by timeline could
clearly illustrates continuous service procedure and involved touch points [3]. Addi‐
tionally, the functional services in speciﬁc environment are supposed to link pre-service,
in-service with post-service into a closed loop.
As shown in Fig. 1, some design tools and methodologies for ESSD are referenced
from PSSD (Product Service System Design). PSSD develops a certain project by
focusing on “Service” and then extending relevant network step by step, the same dose
ESSD. Thus some tools for PSSD could be instructive to ESSD; while some of meth‐
odologies based on PSSD vary for ESSD.

Characteristics of ESSD
As stated above, PSSD has provided much reference values for ESSD, while the latter
also has its own unique features comparing with PSSD.
(1) The Social Tie Among Stakeholders in ESSD Gets Easier to be Strengthened.
Since environment has bigger capacity both physically and virtually compared with
products, more kinds of relationship could be created among diﬀerent stakeholders in
ESSD. Environment supplies people in it with diverse means to create diverse social
relationship, like collaboration, temporary teambuilding, random competition, or one
by one PK. The larger capacity of the environment also brings about more possibilities
for design. In an environment, it is possible for numbers of people to simultaneously
interact then connect with one speciﬁc space or an object in it. The mutual contagious‐
ness between people and physical location gets to be stronger, a speciﬁc physical envi‐
ronment is capable of producing more implications for people’s behaviors meanwhile
people possess more reforming force to it.
As the above service system design for Imperial Street in Hangzhou in Figs. 2 and 3
developed by CDI (Center for Digital Innovation, Tongji University), the whole journey
was connected with interlocking games or activities: for fulfilling game mission, a visitor
has to collaborate with others to Cos-play; to get a coupon, visitors need to take active
part in store games with retailers. Various kinds of positive interaction are helpful for
strengthening social ties among stakeholders.

(2) ESSD Holds Larger Base for Variation in the Environment. A speciﬁc envi‐
ronment could both enhance major functions and satisfy minor needs. It could hold a
variety of touch points to give people more activity choices and more support to indi‐
vidual diﬀerences.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, Smart Lanxi designed by CDI oﬀered citizens multiple
activities in one environment at the same time: interactive screen tower made people
enjoy visual amazement brought by new technology; LBS-social game helped young‐
sters make acquaintance with new friends eﬃciently; media theater provided the old
with metrical local folk; stores organized various activities and customized information
push to involve citizens on site. Many needs of citizens could be satisﬁed in one place.
(3) Long-Term Relationship with Users Gets Harder to Maintain. Due to high
portability of product, once the relationship between users with products is established,
this long-lasting and stable relationship begun to form, and even gradually has strength‐
ened. While conﬁned to space limitation, the relationship between users with a certain
space weakens or even disappears with their leave, which requires ESSD to resort to
various measures to build up and maintain long term relationship with users, such as
member system, or community. In ESSD for Imperial Street, membership system is
helpful for retailers and operators to keep in close touch with customers. The shipping

service, sales deputy, merchandise info push and game community all help to increase
user agglutinant exceedingly.
(4) Eﬀectiveness of Self-explanatory for Environment Need to be Enhanced.
Unlike products which usually containing clear implications for their functions, services
and values, environment is much insuﬃcient in self-expressiveness. Therefore, ESSD
has more needs for touch points to help people make the most of the space for their
intentional services. In smart service system design for Shanghai No.10 People’s
Hospital by CDI, an AR digital way-ﬁnding system with HIS information integrated
helps to provide doctoring service procedure, paths and destination info conveniently.

SESSD
With the radical breakthrough brought by new technologies, the role of digital technol‐
ogies in ESSD has become more and more signiﬁcant, and ESSD has gradually updated
into SESSD (Smart Environment Service System Design). This requires us to pay atten‐
tion to various context ingredients while treating and utilizing “Smart”. The “Smart” in
SESSD mainly refers to breakthrough advance created by new digital technologies, such
as mobile Internet, IOT (Internet of Things), big data and so on. Additionally, “Smart”
for SESSD in not only an enhancement but also a new dimension of design. SESSD has
the following three “Connection”s as its characteristics that are also the entry points for
design.

(1) Connecting Diﬀerent Stakeholders Through Smart Touch Points. Touch points
in ESSD refer to the points of certain service system users could contact, as well as key
components providing the core services to users and making the whole system function.
Mobile Internet, sensors, digital interactive installation or other smart touch points in
SESSD act a vital role in communication between systems with their users. With its
capability in information processing, the smart touch points could serve as linkage points
in the formation of a rich network among various stakeholders. Users could keep in
touch with others anywhere in anytime; operators could supply users more customized
info push or services; collaborators could manage the system and communicate with
each other more conveniently. Intercommunication network among diﬀerent stake‐
holders keeps open, and this interconnection expands in more and more directions with
the advancement of touch points.
In the SESSD case for an exhibition hall designed by CDI, as Fig. 5 below illustrates,
as an important smart touch point, the smart phone App could eﬀectively help visitors
check event info, book tickets, submit feedback, communicate with exhibitors or 3rd
party partner, and share visiting experience with other visitors. Other stakeholders (e.g.
The management with exhibitors, or collaborators) could also build up direct commu‐
nication more conveniently with the App.
Fig. 5. Easier to connects diﬀerent stakeholders about the hall by smart phone app
(2) Connecting the Physical with the Virtual through IOT. As important transfer
ﬂow, material ﬂow and information ﬂow individually stream as service carrier in ESSD.
IOT (Internet of Things) could innovate in the form of ﬂows—connect material ﬂow
with information ﬂow, making every physical entity in SESSD be traceable and get
informed of its own “story” in this digital information era.
Vegetables from smart farms [4] with IOT technology makes it possible for
customers to be informed of their “personal ID”, such as their hometown, age, “parents”
(farmers) or health condition. Plantation and production procedure of the vegetables
Environment-Speciﬁc Smart Service System Design
597

becomes transparent, accurate and evident. The connection of the physical and the virtual
helps to form ﬂows with dual properties and enhance the quality of the service in SESSD.
(3) Connecting the System with the Outside Information and Service Through Big
Data. In ESSD, information ﬂow is helpful to connect the internal system, linking
various stakeholders, oﬀerings, and sub-systems with each other. With the support of
big data platform, information in ESSD could be further connected with the information
and services out of the system, and enhance the quality of the services both in depth and
in diversities.
CDI Soul, an oﬃce management and control system designed by CDI, makes the
most of big data to provide users with quantities of “considerable and understanding”
services. Once the platform got one user’s data, this would not only open up his/her
personal information channel, but also connect with more info resource from big data
platform to optimize the service, e.g. when a VIP user getting close to the oﬃce building,
the system would control the window, door, light, and air conditioner system to supply
the user with the most decent indoor condition, according to the information combining
personal preferences, schedules, health data, and external environment conditions from
big data platform.
In a smart shopping service system designed by CDI, big data platform helps to get
customers’ daily online and oﬄine shopping behaviors and push customized merchan‐
dise information to them. The system could also provide prices of the same product in
other malls and provide related services for product maintenance and repairing.
New digital technology as a “Smart” impetus enhances the quality and diversity of
services in SESSD, also opens up new directions for SESSD in the future; it is far beyond
an intelligent tool, but is already an inevitable context for designers in diﬀerent ﬁelds.
The above three aspects not only illustrate the main characteristics of SESSD, but also
points out directions to follow while constructing a smart service system: constructing
a rich network among stakeholders through smart touch points; increasing quality of the
oﬀerings by connecting the information ﬂow with the material ﬂow; expanding the depth
and scope of the services by connecting with the outside information and services.

Summary
This paper explored the deﬁnition, features, designing tools of ESSD (Environment
Service System Design) and characteristics of SESSD (Smart Environment Service
System Design) through four coherent steps. One of the goals of this research is how to
show the importance of converting from design for a speciﬁc environment in material
logic to design for a speciﬁc functional service in behavior logic for ESSD. We also aim
at exploring the ways to apply potentials of new technologies on SESSD to enhance the
overall quality of the services in design of the digital era. We hope our ﬁndings and
design approaches could inspire more new forms of innovation in service system design.

Abstract. Warning functions in vehicles can be very useful to older drivers for
avoiding crashes due to failure to perceive the danger of a situation. This study
investigated older drivers’ acceptance of vehicle warning functions and the
inﬂuence of driving experience. The results indicated that, in general, the per-
ceived importance of external environment warnings is signiﬁcantly higher than
the perceived importance of car status warnings and driver condition warnings
to older drivers. However, driving experience signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the per-
ceived importance of warning functions. With increasing driving experience,
both the perceived importance of external environment warnings and the per-
ceived importance of car status warnings signiﬁcantly decrease. There is no
decrease in the perceived importance of driver condition warning functions.

Introduction
It was estimated that if the current trafﬁc fatality rate for older people continues,
especially as baby boomers reach their golden years, the number of older-occupant
fatalities could approach nearly 20,000 per year in the U.S. in the near future. This is
almost equal to the annual number of deaths caused by drunk driving on the nation’s
highways [1]. Declines in both physical and cognitive abilities due to aging create
several problems for older drivers while driving. It was found that 60 % of the crashes
involving older drivers were due to “informational” causes, such as failure to perceive
the danger of a situation or failure to respond appropriately to a dangerous situation [2].
With the developments in sensing and information technologies, warning functions in
vehicles can be very useful to provide full-scale information about the external envi-
ronment, vehicles, and even drivers themselves. The warning messages would help
older drivers perceive the danger of a situation.
This research studied older drivers’ perceived importance of the vehicle warning
functions and investigated the correlation between driving experience and the per-
ceived importance of the warning functions. The research ﬁndings are expected to be
useful to designers and researchers investigating older drivers.

Literature Review
Because of aging effects, older adults often experience many difﬁculties while driving.
Vision impairment is one of the most important causes of driving difﬁculties of older
adults [3]. The types of vision problems of older drivers reported include reduced
visual ﬁeld, reduced vision at night or in dim light, and reduced ability to visually
deﬁne and separate objects [4]. Reduced muscle strength, endurance, ﬂexibility, and
motor speed also inﬂuence driving abilities [5]. For example, reduced neck rotation
may impair the driver’s ability to turn their head to see relevant stimuli in their
periphery, which is necessary for safe driving in complex trafﬁc situations and when
changing lanes [5]. Besides the physical aging effects mentioned above, cognitive
aging effects also inﬂuence driving abilities signiﬁcantly. For example, older drivers
often have difﬁculty dealing with unexpected situations due to the decrease in per-
ceptual speed and reaction time [6]. A few aging effects and their inﬂuence on driving
abilities are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1. Aging effects and their inﬂuence on driving ability
Aging effects
Inﬂuence on driving ability
Reduction in visual acuity and contrast

Reduced ability to see objects at night, dusk, or
in dim light [4, 14]
Increased glare sensitivity [7]

glare [14]
Reduced visual ﬁeld [4, 15, 16]
Higher accident rate in situations involving left
turns, intersections, and overtaking [17]
More susceptible to fatigue [18]
Not suitable for long-distance driving or driving

Reduction in muscle strength, endurance,
ﬂexibility, and motor speed [5, 20, 21]
Reduced neck rotation may impair the ability of
the driver to turn their head to see relevant
stimuli in their periphery, necessary for safe
driving in complex trafﬁc situations and when
changing lanes [5]
Decrease in perceptual speed and reaction
time [6, 22, 23]
The speed at which visual information is
processed is an important factor for successfully
negotiating difﬁcult or dangerous trafﬁc
situations [5]
Spatial ability loss [24, 25]
At risk of multiple-vehicle involvement at

Executive ability loss [26]
Difﬁculties occur at the level of executive
function given that the types of crashes in which
older adults are involved often occur in complex
trafﬁc situations [5]
Older Drivers’ Acceptance of Vehicle Warning Functions
601

Vehicle warning functions can be useful to older drivers whose perception abilities
have declined because of aging. Vehicular crashes are often inﬂuenced by three factors
—the environment, the vehicle, and the driver [27]. Warning functions can also be
divided into external environment warnings, driver condition warnings, and car status
warnings. External environment warnings include warnings of dangers outside the
vehicle such as forward collision warning and pedestrian warning. Driver condition
warnings are warnings about the drivers themselves such as fatigue warning systems.
Car status warnings are warnings of vehicles such as car status check systems. This
study sought to determine the type of warning function that was perceived to be the
most important by older drivers. The study also investigated whether driving experi-
ence would inﬂuence the perceived importance of the warning functions. There were
two research questions in this study:
Research question 1: How do older drivers rate the three types of warning
functions?
Research question 2: Would their driving experience have an inﬂuence on their
rating?
3
Method
A survey was used as the research method to investigate older drivers’ rating of the
three types of warning functions and the relation between their driving experience and
acceptance of different warning functions. The seven-point Likert scale was used to
measure the perceived importance of each warning function.
3.1
Questionnaire Preparation
The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The ﬁrst part collected the demographic and
driving experience information of the subjects. The information pertaining to demo-
graphics included subjects’ age, gender, education level, current occupation, driving
experience, and frequency of driving. The second part investigated the perceived
importance of the warning functions. The subjects were asked to rate the extent to
which they agreed with the statements that followed.
Statements of external environment warning functions:
– Danger warning system is important to me.
– Pedestrian warning and braking system is important to me.
Statement of driver condition warning functions:
– Fatigue warning system is important to me.
– Driver condition warning system is important to me.
Statement of car status warning functions:
– Car status warning system is important to me.
– Lane departure warning system is important to me.

Subjects and Survey Details
Older drivers between 55 and 75 years of age who had a driving experience of more
than one year could participate in the survey. A total of 163 subjects participated in the
study including 118 males and 45 females. The average age of the subjects was 60.9 y
(SD = 5.4 y). The average driving experience was 27.6 y (SD = 10.3 y). 107 subjects
drove their cars almost every day, 36 subjects two to three times per week, and 20
subjects less then or approximately once per week. 118 subjects had high school or
secondary school education, 43 subjects had bachelor or college degrees, and 2 subjects
had masters or higher degrees.
3.3
Survey Conduction
The survey was conducted at transportation centers, taxi companies, and senior centers.
Paper-based questionnaires were distributed in person by a research assistant. First, the
research assistant provided a brief description of the research. Then, if the older drivers
agreed to participate in the study, they were asked to sign an informed consent form
and ﬁll the questionnaire. After they ﬁnished the questionnaire, they could receive a
token compensation worth $5 such as bread and milk.

Result
The ANOVA test was used to investigate the differences of the perceived importance of
different types of warning functions to older drivers. The testing results showed that
there was a signiﬁcant difference between the ratings for external environment warn-
ings and those for driver condition warnings. Moreover, there was a signiﬁcant dif-
ference between the ratings for external environment warnings and those for car status
warnings. The perceived importance of external environment warnings was 7.1 % and
5.3 % higher than that of driver condition warnings and car status warnings, respec-
tively. Detailed data and p values are shown in Table 2.

Older Drivers’ Acceptance of Vehicle Warning Functions

Further, the inﬂuence of driving experience on the perceived importance of different
types of warning functions was investigated. Correlation analysis was used to study the
relationship between driving experience and the perceived importance of the warning
functions. First, correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between driving
experience and the perceived importance of external environment warnings. The testing
result found a signiﬁcant negative correlation (Pearson correlation = −0.216, p = 0.007).
It meant that the perceived importance of external environment warnings signiﬁcantly
decreased with increasing driving experience. Further, there was a signiﬁcant negative
correlation between driving experience and the perceived importance of car status
warnings (Pearson correlation = −0.207, p = 0.009), which meant that the perceived
importance of car status warnings signiﬁcantly decreased with increasing driving expe-
rience. There was no signiﬁcant correlation between driving experience and the perceived
importance of driver condition warnings (Pearson correlation = 0.017, p = 0.830).
In order to have an intuitive understanding of how these three variables changed with
driving experience, linear regression was performed between these variables and driving
experience. As shown in Fig. 1, with increasing driving experience, the perceived
importance of external environment warnings and car status warnings signiﬁcantly
decreased. It meant that for experienced older drivers, the perceived importance of
external environment warnings and car status warnings was not as important as for
relatively inexperienced older drivers. On the contrary, there was no signiﬁcant decrease
in the perceived importance of driver condition warnings with increasing driver expe-
rience. This meant that for older drivers with different amounts of driving experience,
driver condition warnings were equally important. For relatively inexperienced older
drivers, the driver condition warning was still signiﬁcantly less important than external
environment warnings and car status warnings; however, with increasing driving expe-
rience, the driver condition warning was as important as the other two types of warnings.

Discussion
This study investigated older adults’ acceptance of different vehicle warning functions
and the inﬂuence of driving experience on the acceptance. The study results indicated
that, in general, the perceived importance of external environment warnings is sig-
niﬁcantly higher than the perceived importance of car status warnings and driver
condition warnings to older adults. Owing to declines in perceptive abilities and speed,
the external environment warning is very important for them. About 60 % of crashes
involving older drivers were due to “informational” causes such as failure to perceive
the danger of a situation or failure to make an appropriate response to a dangerous
situation [2]. It is essential to ensure information accuracy as older drivers’ perception
of the external environment is very important.
Also, the results indicated that driving experience signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the
perceived importance of warning functions. With increasing driving experience, both
the perceived importance of external environment warnings and perceived importance
of car status warnings signiﬁcantly decreased. However, there was no decrease in the
perceived importance of driver condition warning functions. The literature suggested
that with practice, drivers learn where to search for relevant information and respond to
it more quickly [28, 29]. Experienced drivers look at the road farther ahead than
novices [30]. For experienced older drivers, the perceived importance of external
environment warnings and car status warnings were found to be lower than that for
relatively inexperienced older drivers. However, the importance of driver condition
warnings does not change for both experienced and novice older drivers. Recently,
researchers have begun to investigate and develop technologies to monitor the vital
signs of older drivers. For example, Walter et al. investigated embedded measurement
techniques for non-contact monitoring of vital signs, including capacitive electrocar-
diogram monitoring (cECG), mechanical movement analysis (ballistocardiogram,
BCG) using piezo-foils, and inductive impedance monitoring [31]. Older drivers may
be easily tired and may feel sleepy owing to the effects of medication. Moreover, their
health condition may suddenly deteriorate owing to health problems such as hyper-
tension and heart disease. Monitoring of driver function and driver condition warnings
could help prevent crashes to some extent.
The subjects’ past exposure to the warning functions, which may have had an
inﬂuence on their ratings, was not investigated; this is a limitation of this study. In
future studies, more warning functions should be studied with a more detailed
description of each function.

Abstract. This study conducted a questionnaire survey to investigate the
requirements and preferences toward the services and appearance of home ser-
vice robot. And the psychological factors regarding human robot interaction,
including likability, sincerity, trust and privacy were explored and discussed. The
preliminary results show that functions of house chores, security and emergency
detecting were highly expected and preferred by 267 participants. While the
social and caretaking/nursing functions were not preferred as expected. The
participants liked medium size robots without too many facial features. Hands
and arms that extended human reach were more valued than legs and wheels that
substitute human movement. Participants also valued the interface of response
and information, such as the body screen on the robot. Psychological factors of
likability, sincerity, trust and privacy correlated with each other signiﬁcantly, and
were also related to the preference of robot appearance. This study takes a clear
proﬁle of the users’ expectation on future home intelligent service robots.

Introduction
The rapid development of robots has not only speed up the implementations in
industries but also in our daily life environment. Features of autonomous systems
intelligence, social systems intelligence and augmentation of human beings have
gained much attention in the design and development of intelligent service robot [1, 2].
However, technological use and affordance today have changed and transformed in a
signiﬁcant way, and the perspective toward the intelligent service robots in home
environment are different. Therefore, this study aims to investigate users’ attitude
towards the home intelligent service robots, including the services, outﬁts and the
psychological factors in human robot interaction. And the necessary requirements of
home service robots are constructed. Through the multidimensional investigation,
users’ needs and the relationship of HRI factors with the robots appearance are dis-
covered for designing attractive and trustable robots.

Research Design
The survey plans to ﬁgure the attitudes and expectations toward home ISRs in services,
appearances, and human robot interactions (HRIs). Questionnaire was designed into 6
parts according to the three aspects of expectations and one portion of personal infor-
mation. Part 1 was the personal information. It included the surveyors’ nationality, age,
gender, major, and buying behavior. In the buying behavior, we investigated their buying
tendency (how long would you buy new products after they had been sold), having any
home ISR and the satisfaction about it, and the willingness to own any home ISR in the
future. While users’ background and direct using experiences might affect their attitude
toward intelligent service robots, indirect experiences such as users’ buying intensions
and use of homogeneous products may also affect their perspectives toward home service
robots. The second part of the survey investigated the requirement about the services
carried out by intelligent service robots at home. Six-points scale was used to evaluate 18
services in each. The higher score was the higher requirement for that service, and
participants’ perceived importance of each function was collected and analyzed.
The third part of the survey investigated the style traits, body structures, and size
about the appearance of intelligent service robots. In style traits, 8 questions of
semantic differential scale were used to collect participants’ opinions about how the
intelligent service robots should look like. The participants also expressed how com-
fortable they would feel toward different types of service robots with a seven-points
scale. Six kinds of body structures were asked through two alternative responses
method. In each question, participants chose one kind of structures they liked. Finally,
they were asked to circle the favorite size of robots.
The survey also collected participants’ opinions of human robot interaction, lika-
bility, sincerity, and trust and privacy in speciﬁc. Six points scale was used to evaluate
the degree of agreeableness. The higher score was the higher agreeableness. Likability
is a positive emotion toward a personal attractive trait. In order to ﬁgure out how the
robot should be in their attractiveness, the scale we used was modiﬁed from Rau’s in
2009 [3]. The calculated Cronbach’s a for likability in our study is 0.88. Sincerity
represents the true heart in a human interaction. We developed 11 questions in the
sincerity factor and Cronbach’s a is 0.90. The trust and privacy was evaluated whether
the robot was believable and trustworthy. The scale also referred from Rau’s report [3].
In this study, the Cronbach’s a for trust and privacy is 0.86. The more likability, the
more sincerity and trustee would be assessed. The three HRI components should highly
correlate to each other.
The ﬁnal part of the survey investigated participants’ acceptance toward the
intelligent service robots in the future. We asked the participants to prioritize their
preferences among entertainment robots, assistant/servant robots, social companion
robots, caretakers/nurse robots, labor service robots, safety/security robots, information
providing robots and remotely accessed robots. We also asked how much money would
you spend on purchasing robots and when will you purchase it. One open question was
addressed to describe the other ideas about home intelligent service robots.

Preliminary Findings
By ruling out the missing responses, 267 valid responses were used for further analysis.
The following session reported the preliminary ﬁndings including the descriptive
statistics of participants’ preferences of intelligent service robots, and the relationship
between participants’ features and their attitudes toward the service robots.
3.1
Participants’ Expectation Toward the Services of Home Robots
Among the 267 participants, 54 % were females and 46 % were males. And their ages
ranged from 18 to 35 years old. The portions of age under 18 was 17 %, 19 to 25 was
79 % and 26 to 35 was 3 %. Most of the participants did not have any home intelligent
service robots (98 %). The buying tendency for new products, 20 % would buy them
after they sold in several months, 65 % was after one year and 15 % was above 2 years.
When we asked the willingness to own any home service robots, 57 % said they will
and 36 % were not sure.
The services which were thought as needed for a home service robot, with the
average score above 5, were house chore related function, security function and
detecting emergency phenomenon such as earthquake and typhoon. The social factors
such as companion, chatting, interpersonal communication and connections were
evaluated somewhat not necessary with the average around 3. The details of the service
assessment were shown as Fig. 1.

The general pattern of requirements in each service was the same between overall
data and each gender. However, there were some different opinions between male and
female participants regarding home assistance tasks. As shown in Fig. 1, it was found
that female participants emphasized more on house chore (t(265) = −2.86, p <.01),
security/safety (t(265) = −2.30, p < .05) and ﬁx things (t(265) = −2.60, p < .01)
than male participants.
One way ANOVA was conducted to compare the three buying tendencies: buying
new products in several months, after one year and above two years. Once the ANOVA
was signiﬁcant, LSD was used for post hoc analysis. We only found signiﬁcant dif-
ference in ﬁx things service (F (2,264) = 4.52, p < .05). Post hoc showed the average
score of buying after one year was signiﬁcant higher than above two years (p < .05).
3.2
Participants’ Preferences of the Robot Appearance and Body Feature
For the appearance of the home service robots, the participants were more comfortable
in associating home ISRs with futuristic, machine-like, simple, female ﬁgure, brighter
color, light weighted, organic and low character. However, the average scores we got
were all closing to the middle score 4. Only exception was the color trait. It must be
bright not dark (Fig. 2).
For the body structures of the home service robots, chi-square analysis was con-
ducted to examine the proportion differences in each item related to body structure.
And the results suggested signiﬁcant preferences on ﬁngers instead of palms

(v2 = 78.75, p < .01), and on less facial features (v2 = 29.67, p < .01) with abstract
instead of concrete faces (v2 = 21.07, p < .01). Also the participants expected the
home service robots to have arms (v2 = 228.50, p < .01) and a body screen in the front
(v2 = 117.34, p <.01). Generally the participants liked home service robots to have
ﬁnger (77.15 %), no facial feature (66.67 %), virtual face (64.04 %), arm (96.25 %)
and body screen (83.15 %). And they preferred home service robots of medium size
(v2 = 262.39, p < .01). Other body features including wheels (54.68 %) or feet
(45.32 %) was not signiﬁcantly different (v2 = 2.341, p = .13) (Fig. 3).
Additionally, male participants showed signiﬁcantly stronger preferences over the
features like futuristic (t(265) = 2.53, p < .05), female ﬁgure (t(265) = 2.17, p < .05)
and organic (t(265) = 5.03, p < .01). Female participants, on the other hand, liked the
home service robots of more machine-like (t(265) = 3.77, p < .01), simple looks (t
(265) = 5.01, p < .01), and brighter color (t(265) = −3.10, p < .01). The tendency in
choosing the body structures was similar among male and female participants. But
based on further comparison by chi square analysis, female participants signiﬁcantly
preferred robots without facial features (74.31 %; v2 = 8.21, p < .01), and of abstract
virtual faces (70.38 %v2 = 5.04, p < .05) more than males (57.72 %; 56.91 %).

3.3
Participants’ Perceived Importance of the HRI Factors
A correlation analysis was conducted on the three HRI dimensions. The results sug-
gested that the participants viewed the trust and privacy (5.01/6) as the most important
aspects for them to interact with home service robots, followed by the likability
(4.65/6) of the robot, and the last issue is the sincerity of the robot. It was also found
that the likability of robots possibly affected the trustworthy to robots in interaction,
and vice versa (Table 1).
Echoing the perceived importance reported by the participants, the comparison of
participants of different buying tendency also found that those who tended to buy
things later in one year, viewed sincerity as the least important for home service robots,
their scores were signiﬁcantly lower than the participants who bought things in several
months, and those who bought in more than two years (p < .05).
3.4
Participants’ Preference of the Robot Types
Among the eight major types of robots, most participants thought the most popular
robot was labor service robot in the future. The second was the safety/security robot.
The following sequence was remotely accessed robot, assistant/servant robot, infor-
mation providing robot, caretakers/nurse robot, and entertainment robot. The last one
was social companion robot. The participants estimated time to have a robot at home is
within 10 years (43 %). And the average price they would afford was 175,292 NT
dollars (about $5,200), which equaled to the costs of 4 refrigerators or 2 motorbikes.
The results reﬂected the participants’ stereotypes of expensive robots (Fig. 4).

Discussion and Conclusion
These results showed that the services of home ISRs were preferred in the order of
house chore related function, security function and detecting emergency function. If
designing involved gender preferences, the house chore, security/safety and ﬁx things
functions would be more important for female users. By comparing the participants of
different buying tendencies, it was found that late buyers (after one year) valued the
practical function, such as ﬁxing things, of the home service robots. While the results of
this study suggested that the local requirements of service robot in Taiwan were similar
to the worldwide societies [4–7], the participants in this study emphasized the practical
functions than the previous studies. Our participants expected the home ISRs to provide
services in labor, secure, servant or information providing dimensions ﬁrst. And
viewed the social functions and features, such as caretaking and nursing as least
necessary.
For the outlooks of the home ISRs, the results suggested a preferable robot of a
human-like physical structure, but without an actual face and face features. Abstract
representation of virtual faces is more acceptable among all participants, and speciﬁ-
cally valued by female participants. The limbs of robots must have arms and hands for
reaching out. Mobility was regarded as necessary for home ISRs, but it did not matter
whether the robots moved by wheels or feet. Also the participants expected a body
screen on the robots. Participants’ preferences toward the appearances and functions of
home service robots suggested that they perceived home ISRs as more like a machine
than an agent. With the correlation analysis of robot outlooks and the HRI factors, the
results clearly showed that once the appearance of the home ISRs is suitable for users,
the likability and trustworthy could also be enhanced.
This study conducted a multidimensional development of home ISRs through the
survey. The preliminary ﬁndings of the study answered the questions about what robots
can do, how they look like and how the interaction between human and robots. To
ﬁgure out the demanding differences in gender and buying tendency, the comparisons
were also conducted and found out some interesting results. The designers in the future
can consider the differences in different groups to design more favorable and useable
home ISRs for each possible owner.

Abstract. The world trends toward aging society because of low total fertility
rate and long human life, and we have to face the issue that youth in the feature
will have heavier load to take care of the elderly living than that at present. In
order to solve such problem, cyber physical system is implemented, which is a
collaborating system by integrating computational elements and physical entities.
In this work, we develop the framework of the elderly care supervision system
based on sensor network, and it is veriﬁed in a long-term caring facility for
dementia caring. Moreover, user interface runs the developed software. Care‐
giver, family member, and system manager can manipulate the friendly user
interface to obtain information of the elderly activity and the anomaly. The resul‐
tants will demonstrate that how activity recognition and elderly living analysis
are implemented by application program runs on mobile device.

Introduction
Facing the issues of total fertility rate (TFR) of the world declining and population aging,
it implies that an aging society is coming. According to the reports [1, 2], TFR of the
world declines from 4.85 in 1970 to 2.63 in 2015. Additionally, regions with the lowest
ﬁve TFRs of world were in Asia in 2015, they were South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Macau, and Singapore. Low TFR means that youth will have heavy load in the elderly
care in the future due to the ratio of elder to youth increases year by year. In [3], the
report reveals that caregiver support ratio is 7 in 2010 in America, and it will drop to 3
in 2050. Therefore, how to manage manpower eﬃciently in the elderly care is an impor‐
tant task now.
Cyber physical system (CPS) is a collaborating system by integrating computational
elements and physical entities. In the past, researchers investigated approaches based
on CPS to take care of people living in smart home. For physical entities of CPS, diverse
sensors are deployed in building, including, temperature sensor, humidity sensor,
ambient light sensor, current sensor, positioning sensor, passive infrared motion sensor,

and depth camera, etc. Moreover, sensors on wearable devices are capable of collecting
vital signs and people action, such as, accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate variability,
body temperature. In the literature [4–7], the applications based on CPS were presented,
including, activity analysis/recognition, anomaly detection, home energy saving, and
preference estimation, etc. In [4, 5], Weng et al. analyzed human activity in home for
determination of energy-saving service. Their improved method was performed on
multi-resident environment. In [6], Gu et al. used data mining instead of machine
learning for recognition of 25 daily activities.
A common management technology is applied to those sensors and transmits sensing
data to cloud server through Internet. Cyber layer subscribes data from cloud server.
Subsequently, analysis technologies are applied to sensing data, such as activity recog‐
nition (AR) and anomaly detection (AD). The objectives of AR are to recognize the
elderly activity as well as to generate activities of daily living (ADL). The objective of
AD is to detect abnormal activity/behavior by analyzing recognized results, and then
warning sign is activated. In the previous work [7], we proposed a scheme to analyze
sensing data as well as to recognize people activity. The analyzed data were mono-type
sensing data collected in the single-woman home [8]. Our scheme can recognize activity,
detect anomaly, generate ADL, and estimate personal preference in activity habit.
In this work, we develop the framework of the elderly care supervision system based
on sensor network, and it is veriﬁed in a long-term caring facility for dementia caring.
The user interface displayed information of deployed sensors, elder’s activity and
anomaly is designed for caregiver, family member, and system manager. The elderly
ADL recognized by analyzing ambient sensing data and body sensing data are stored in
cloud server; moreover, the system detects the elderly anomaly and then lights up a bulb
for warning. Caregiver can obtain information of elder’s activity and abnormal event
informed by the portable device. Family member can remotely look over his/her grand‐
parent’s health status shown on the portable device. For system managers, they operate
the portable device to monitor connection status of ambient sensors. The rest of this
paper is organized as follows: the interview to the long-term caring facility and the
scenarios for the elderly care are described in Sect. 2. Sensor deployment and architec‐
ture are, respectively, introduced in Sects. 3 and 4. Activity analysis is presented in
Sect. 5. The user interface and functions will be shown in Sect. 6, and the concluding
remarks will be drawn in Sect. 7.

Interview and Scenario Design
In order to understand trend of elder care in upcoming aging society and requirement of
caring facility, we visited and interviewed health professionals, doctors, and caregivers.
Table 1 lists the interview summary with respect to four major aspects, namely, safety,
health, caregiver load, and quality of care. According to the insights gained from the
interviews mentioned above, we proposed three scenarios in our design, namely,
straying detection, sleep pattern detection, and night-time bed-leaving detection.

Table 1. Interview summary with respect to four major aspects
Major aspects
Sample issues
Safety
   • Safety First! It’s important to provide immediate notiﬁcation for
falling accidents
• Need information and communication technology (ICT) to help or
prevent straying and to detect night-time bed-leaving for the elderly
Health
   • It is important to help the elderly to establish regular life activities
patterns
• Healthy life styles are helpful, e.g., exercises, enough sleep, healthy
diet
Caregiver load
   • There exists shortage of caregiver in most elderly care facilities
• Paper work is time-consuming, ICT could improve eﬃciency in
caring tasks
Quality of care
   • With sensor network, caring process could be personalized and opti‐
mized
• User interface design could help caregiver/medical professionals to
quickly understand the elderly health and care condition
2.1
Scenario 1: Stray Detection
Wandering behaviors and getting disoriented situations are commonly seen in the elderly
with dementia. Therefore, in this scenario, beacon sensors ﬁrst collect the position and
the time data of the elderly as shown in Fig. 1(a). Then, with the forbidden area detection,
the proposed system could notify caregiver immediately to ﬁnd the elder as well as to
oﬀer in-time assistance.
2.2
Scenario 2: Sleep Pattern Detection
Dementia and sleep are closely related with one another. The elderly with dementia
tends to have irregular sleep pattern, and lack of sleep increases the risk of dementia
later in life. Thus, in our design shown in Fig. 1(b), motion sensor detects elder’s action
automatically when he/she sleeps on the bed. The duration of activity between two active
signs of motion sensor is analyzed for estimation of sleep pattern. Moreover, through
sleep pattern and anomaly detection, our system could actively notify caregiver to pay
attention to elder’s sleep.
2.3
Scenario 3: Night-Time Bed-Leaving Detection
Caring facility concerns the issue of the elderly safety during night time. It is high
possibility that elder falls when he/she gets out of bed at night. Therefore, sensor
deployed on bedside detects incident of night-time bed-leaving. In addition, the system
activates night light near the bed, so that it is helpful to decrease the risk of falling.
Meanwhile, the system turns on the bulbs in nursing station, and it notiﬁes caregiver to
take care of the elderly immediately. Figure 1(c) shows the ﬂowchart of the scenario 3.

Deployment
The issue of deployment is divided into three major topics, including, space ﬁeld,
devices, and subjects. Figure 2 portrays two ﬂoors of the institution for dementia caring
facility, where Fig. 2(a) indicates the ﬁrst ﬂoor of institution including the entrance and
a larger space of rehabilitation room as well as Fig. 2(b) represents the third ﬂoor of
institution accommodates nine rooms including toilets, a living room, a nursing station,
a dining room, a yard, and a activity room.

The red pins on Fig. 2 represent the positions where devices/sensors are deployed.
These devices are anchor nodes which provide the elderly positioning information;
motion sensors which sense people action for analyzing the elderly activity status; air
mentors that detect air quality; bulbs which adjust the light saturation and colors to alarm
caregivers in nursing station what situation is; and badges (mobile nodes) are wearable
devices which send signal periodically to anchor nodes in order to track the elderly
position. In the experimental environment, the tested elders’ ages range from 70 to 80
years old and live in Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, and Room 4 on the third ﬂoor as shown
in Fig. 2(b). They wear badges, and their families accept the agreement for personal
positioning owing to privacy.

System Architecture
We push messages to data bus and send messages to all subscribers which interested in
our channel. Therefore, subscribers receive only topics of the interest without receiving
all information from data bus, so applications can easily obtain accurate information on
the desired system to supervise. The abilities of multi-channel data bus have three:
(1) pub/sub: publish and subscribe message for data bus by topic; (2) cross-platform:
supports message passing for diﬀerent platform and virtual machines; and (3) imme‐
diacy: instant information delivered to the data bus and various services instantly receive
data.

Y.-C. Zeng et al.

In order to allow that CPS integrates every type of device, CPS has a service model
for data normalization, so that the system can obtain information in a variety of envi‐
ronments, such as medical, home. In addition, the information is converted into a uniﬁed
format. In this work, the system supports the health and environmental equipments, it
integrates data formats and units from various manufacturers, so that we can collect
messages and control devices through Internet. Figure 3 shows the diagram of devices
and equipments connection in this work. It is established for intelligent health care
system, and it is helpful to improve quality of personal health management.

Activity Analysis
According to the interview summary mentioned in Sect. 2, caregivers in caring facility
concern elders’ position and their states. There are two ways to obtain people’s position
in this work. Tracking people using wearable devices, such as, beacon sensor, smart
watch, and smart phone, is a direct method. Meanwhile, some wearable devices provide
more functions to measure vital signs and then are capable of transmitting data to cloud
server via wireless communication. However, in some situations people feel uncom‐
fortable by wearing device, such as the elderly with dementia. Position tracking will be
failed as people take oﬀ the devices. The other method is to analyze sensing data derived
from ambient sensors, such as passive infrared motion sensor. While people appear in
room, sensors deployed around the room will be activated. The objective of activity
analysis is to mine useful information by analyzing sensing data. In the previous work
[7], we proposed methods to recognize people activity with respect to his/her position.
There are eight daily activities recognized, and those activities are highly related to
functions in rooms. In this work, we emphasize on three types of activity analysis, and
the details are described as follows.
Design of User Interface for Elderly Care Supervision System
621

5.1
Activity of Daily Living
In the elderly caring facility, eight activities are recognized, including, “Sleep”,
“Relaxing”, “Eating”, “Toilet”, “Go out”, “Exercise”, “Attend Class”, and “Others”.
The elderly wears a badge which is a positioning sensor in order to acquire his/her
position immediately. Furthermore, passive infrared motion sensors are deployed on
bedside and on ceiling above bed. The objective of deploying motion sensors is to detect
sleep status and incident of night-time bed-leaving. Figure 4(a) shows the pie chart of
ADL one day, and the area of pie represents the ratio of total hours of activity to 24 h.
Figure 4(b) illustrates the bar charts of activities one day, the bar size represents duration
of activity.

(Color ﬁgure online)
5.2
Preference in Duration of Activity
Everyone spends time in activity is diﬀerent to another does. However, his/her prefer‐
ence in duration of activity is not change violently. Referred to [7], durations of all
activities are collected and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of scaled-durations
of activities are computed. The CDF of scaled-duration of activity is approximate to that
of normal distribution. Therefore, the 95 % conﬁdence interval of normal distribution is
a criterion to estimate duration of activity. For example, Fig. 5 shows two CDFs
Fig. 5. Cumulative density functions of (a) “Sleep”, and (b) “Toilet”
622
Y.-C. Zeng et al.

corresponding to “Sleep” with the duration of 29,732 s and “Toilet” with the duration
of 270 s.
5.3
Anomaly Detection
Three kinds of conditions are concerned as anomaly in caring facility, i.e., falling down,
abnormal behavior, and straying. Wearable devices (such as, smart phone and smart
watch) embedded accelerometer and gyroscope are helpful for detection of the elderly
falling immediately. Furthermore, the factors that lead to the elderly falling after he/she
gets out of bed are unsafe environment (such as, dimly-lit room) and un-awakened
consciousness. In order to prevent accident, passive infrared motion sensor deployed at
bedside is employed to detect incident of night-time bed-leaving.
While the elderly spends more time in activity than usual, the situation is considered
as abnormal behavior. For instance, someone spends more time in the toilet, it is highly
possible that people has fallen or fainted a period of time. Therefore, the estimated
duration of activity (mentioned in Sect. 5.2) is employed to determine when abnormal
behavior begins.
For straying, it is an emergency that the elderly with dementia leaves caring facility
without any caregiver notiﬁes it. To solve such problem, the elderly wears a badge
embedded with positioning sensor. The system detects whether people locates in
forbidden area, such as, front gate. If elder enters the forbidden area, the system sends
warning message to notify caregiver.

User Interface and Functions
We develop framework of elderly supervision system based sensor network. Figure 6
shows the diagram of the proposed system, and it is veriﬁed in the caring facility. Care‐
giver, family member, and system manager can browse information via the designed
user interface performed on portable device. The details of functions of user interface
are introduced as follows.

Main Page
Figure 7 shows the main page of the designed user interface, where three buttons placed
on for caregiver, family member, and system manager. Caregiver monitors elder’s
activity and abnormal event. Family member can remotely look over his/her elderly
member’s health status. For system managers, they monitor connection status of sensors
deployed in the facility.

6.2
Descriptions of Functions
Caregiver can browse four kinds of information by pressing left-hand side buttons on
page as shown in Fig. 8, including, real-time monitoring, safety incident, activity of
daily living, and information of vital sign. For real-time monitoring, Fig. 8 shows four
elders’ positions with diﬀerent icons. The green-circle represents the No. 19 elder is
normal. The red-icons are warning signs. The red-triangle, the red-rectangle, the red-

Pressing the red-icon or the button of safety incident, caregiver obtains the 3-min
history trajectory of unsafe incident. For example, Fig. 9 displays the history trajectory
of the elderly straying.
Fig. 9. Interface of safety incident (Color ﬁgure online)
The function of ADL is to reveal the elderly activity status. The ﬁrst function is to
list the summaries of the eight activities as shown in Fig. 10(a). Green-circle and red-
circle represent normal status and abnormal status yesterday, respectively. Pressing the
elder’s name, the user interface displays four charts of the elderly ADL as shown in
Fig. 10(b), including, the percentages of eight activities per day (top-left), ADL per day
(top-right), normal/abnormal activities per month (bottom-left), and diﬀerence between
normal ADL and recognized ADL (bottom-right). The top two charts are generated base
on activity recognition mentioned in Sect. 5.1. The chart of normal/abnormal activities
per month summarizes the results of anomaly detection mentioned in Sect. 5.3. In order
to observe whether the elderly activity changes violently or not, the bottom-right chart
illustrates the diﬀerence between normal ADL and recognized ADL. The normal ADL
is computed by averaging 7-day ADL prior to the observational day. Caregiver and
family member are authorized to monitor the elderly health status by pressing the button
of information of vital sign, which is shown in Fig. 11.

Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce the elderly care supervision system. The developed system
is implemented based on sensor network, and it is veriﬁed in the long-term caring facility
for dementia caring. Devices and equipments are deployed in the caring facility, which
are connected to cyber layer via data management technology. According to the inter‐
view to caregivers, four major aspects are concerned in three scenarios for the elderly
care. Therefore, activity analysis methods referred to the previous work are presented
for detections of elders’ activity statuses and anomaly. Finally, caregiver and family
member can browse the elderly activities via the designed user interface. System
managers can monitor connection status of sensors via the user interface as well.

Abstract. The transformation to service economy calls for the development of
Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS2), which has changed traditional
business models greatly. In recent years, there are trends and needs from the
industry to further develop IPS2 by integrating advanced information tech-
nologies. While the emergence of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) provides
whole new viewpoints and approaches for IPS2 construction, there are still no
public recognized systematic solutions. To solve this problem, the concept of
intelligent IPS2 and a framework integrating IPS2 with CPS is proposed in this
work. The system decomposition and intellectualization process of intelligent
IPS2 are analyzed, trying to ﬁgure out the interaction mechanisms between IPS2
and CPS. Then A general architecture of CPS supported intellectualization of
IPS2 is developed, which is constructed by ﬁve layers. The model for intelligent
IPS2 is put forward based on industry investigation, trying to offer possible
guidelines and roadmap for those service transforming companies.

Introduction
As the society developing towards service economy, researches on Industrial Product
Service Systems (IPS2) have received great attention from both academia and indus-
tries [1]. Advantages of the development of IPS2 are widely discussed. New business
models based on service logic have been showing signiﬁcant power in achieving
sustainable economy [2]. IPS2 is integration of industrial product and service shares,
which represents a new solution-oriented approach for delivering value in use to the
customer during the whole life cycle of a product [3]. However, the present researches
about IPS2 are mainly focused on basic concepts, business models, value chain and
operational scheme design of IPS2 [4–6]. How to connect these theories with the real
operations in industry is still not be solved.
Recent years, the fast development of communication technologies, Internet of
information, Internet of things, cloud computing and big data analytics have changed

the objective internal and external environment for IPS2 development. There is a trend
for integration of products, services, sensors, and the Internet, which has already been
discussed as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) [7, 8]. CPS may bring a breakthrough in
the development of IPS2.
This work is based on systematic investigation during project cooperation with
three typical IPS2 companies in three different industries (construction machinery,
elevator and power equipment) in eastern China, including. Those companies are trying
to establish intellectualized industrial product service systems by integrating CPS,
which are deﬁned as intelligent IPS2 in this work. The research is trying to ﬁgure out a
general framework and maturity model for intelligent IPS2.
Contents of this work are organized as follows. An introduction and a brief review
of present work about IPS2 and CPS are carried out to clarify related concepts and
depict state of the art in Sects. 1 and 2. Then a framework of CPS integrated intelligent
IPS2 is proposed in Sects. 3 and 4, which contains three procedures, including system
decomposition of intelligent IPS2, intellectualization process of IPS2 by integrating
CPS, and then a general architecture of CPS supporting Intellectualization of IPS2.
Last, the discussions and conclusions are offered in Sect. 6.

Related Work About CPS
A CPS is a system of collaborating computational elements controlling physical
entities. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical pro-
cesses, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and
vice versa [9]. The notion is closely tied to concepts of robotics and sensor networks
with intelligence mechanisms proper of computational intelligence leading the path-
way. Ongoing advances in science and engineering will improve the link between
computational and physical elements by means of intelligent mechanisms, dramatically
increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efﬁciency, functionality, reliability, safety, and
usability of cyber-physical systems [10]. Today, a precursor generation of CPS can be
found in areas as diverse as aerospace, automotive, chemical processes, civil infras-
tructure, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, entertainment, and con-
sumer appliances.
The emergence of CPS provides whole new viewpoints and approaches for IPS2
construction. The improvements of information, automation, sensing and artiﬁcial
intelligent technologies have changed the way of contacting, interacting and problem
solving. And now, it’s also beginning to change traditional business models. As
mentioned above, while CPS has been widely applied in improving product design,
manufacturing intelligence and other areas, CPS is rarely studied to support IPS2
intelligence.
Technologies will offer new opportunities for companies to provide novel products
and services [11]. We believe the advent of CPS will enhance and accelerate the
process [12]. So far, there have been some researches using information technologies to
help improve the operational performance of service tasks. Zhu et al. [13] proposed a
web-based product service system for aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul
services. Zhang et al. [14] offered a framework for design knowledge management and

reuse for product service systems in construction machinery industry. Teixeira et al.
[15] tried to ﬁgure out a novel framework linking prognostics and health Management
and product–service systems using online simulation. Selak et al. [16] presented a
condition monitoring and fault diagnostics (CMFD) system for hydropower plants
(HPP). Though those researches about information technology applications in sup-
porting product service systems have been conducted, none of them have given a
systematic framework of how information technologies, especially CPS, can be inte-
grated with IPS2.

Framework Decomposition of Intelligent IPS2
An intelligent IPS2 ﬁrstly should be a product service system, which means that the
basic value co-creation network should be built up according to the IPS2 business
model. Based on the summary of investigation in several different industries and lit-
erature review, a framework of intelligent IPS2 is proposed, as shown in Fig. 1. The
framework consists of seven parts, namely customer needs centered product lifecycle,
stakeholders, service abilities, business models, cyber physical system, supporting

theories and resources. The coordination of these modules is the basis for the con-
struction and normal operation of intelligent IPS2.
Customer Needs Centered Product Lifecycle Under Service-Dominant Logic.
Traditional understanding of IPS2 value chain mainly focuses on the after sales pro-
cedures. In this paper, based on the work of Aurich et al. [17, 18], Takata and Umeda
[19], it is extended to the whole lifecycle of products with customers participated in
every stage, including product R&D, manufacturing, sales, delivery, after sales and
recycling. Characters and requirements in other procedures of the product lifecycle are
also developed, which could be found in Table 1.
Stakeholders. In an intelligent IPS2, stakeholders generally include customers (or
users), R&D staff, manufacturers, carrier operators, all kinds of service providers and
other related roles participating throughout the lifecycle of products. Different indus-
tries may have different stakeholder constitution. But under the notion of IPS2, all
stakeholders are supposed to cooperate as a network for value co-creation. Value
co-creation is realized through work ﬂow reconﬁguration and business model inno-
vation other than simple transaction and compromise.

Service Abilities. With all the resources integrated and CPS supporting, three cate-
gories of service packages or service abilities, including basic services, extended ser-
vices and value added services, can be conﬁgured and provided according to speciﬁc
needs of different customers. Basic services are the core of IPS2, then follows extended
services in the middle layer, and value added services in the outermost layer. Char-
acters and examples of different service categories are offered in Table 2.
IPS2 Business Models. Generally, existing business models of IPS2 basically can be
summarized into three categories [4, 20], which are product oriented IPS2, use oriented
IPS2 and performance oriented IPS2, which are explained in detail in Table 3. In the
paradigm of service-dominant logic and CPS integration, service and performance
oriented IPS2 are becoming much more popular. The supporting of CPS accelerates the
evolvement of the transformation from product based business models to service based
business models.

Cyber Physical System. CPS is the key factor in the intellectualization process of
IPS2. CPS integrates all kinds of resources and packages them as services and release
them automatically or autonomously. Detailed research about how CPS interacts with
IPS2 and structure of CPS will be introduced in the following Sect. 4.
Related Supporting Theories. Apart from CPS, theories about directing the trans-
formation of traditional companies to service based business models should be pro-
posed and developed. Those theories can be categorized from three dimensions. The
ﬁrst are theories about helping ﬁgure out the mechanism of value network and value
creation in IPS2. The second are those supporting IPS2 scheme design to meet cus-
tomer needs as far as possible. The third are from the operational layer that direct IPS2
supply chain in order to improve the efﬁciency of service supplying and cut down the
costs. All those theories should be combined together forming a theoretical system to
support service ability fostering, service modes innovation, service workﬂow opti-
mization and ﬁnally value co-creation.
Service Resources. Service resources are basic support for the operation of intelligent
manufacturing. Service resources can be divided into two kinds, which are physical
resources and virtual resources. Different from traditional IPS2, physical resources get
upgraded and are able to be connected to the network via the embedded intelligent
modules, including bar codes, chips, RF wireless module or other sensors. With the
intelligent module, these physical resources are packaged as virtual resources, which
can be perceived, managed, dispatch and even controlled remotely through the CPS.
The virtual cyber system and the real physical system will be operated in two parallel
spaces with precise synchronization.

Intellectualization Process of IPS2 by Integrating CPS
CPS helps IPS2 to enhance the loose relationships between stakeholders and resources,
and to be closed integrated network connections. The purpose of integrating IPS2 with
CPS is to improve the operational efﬁciency and accelerate the process of value
co-creation in following ways:
Service Process Automation. With CPS integrated, customer needs and product
usage data can be obtained directly. Service needs can be fast responded automatically.
Meanwhile, orders from customers and pre-services forecasted from data statistics are
able to be processed automatically. Proactive services become a mainstream that
customer needs can be satisﬁed just at the right time instead of passive service offered
after serious problems occur with customer complains.
Service Activity Autonomy. Both users and products can be served by themselves
with CPS supporting. Products can upgrade their software automatically, or even
self-diagnosis and self-healing when hardware failure or software crash occur. Users
can learn new skills and get technical support with the help of embedded interactive
guide software. Fast developing artiﬁcial intelligence will enhance and accelerate this
trend of CPS application in intelligent IPS2 signiﬁcantly.
A Framework for Integrating Industrial Product-Service Systems
633

Service Resource Integration. Under the circumstances of Internet of information
and things, those supportive virtual and physical resources can be distributed in a more
efﬁcient way. Information of service needs, resource allocation and amounts gets
integrated seamlessly. And meanwhile, physical resources are shared and planed with
centralized management, so that the inventory, risks, costs and wastes can be mini-
mized towards stable and sustainable operation.

Architecture for CPS Supported Intellectualization of IPS2
A general architecture of CPS supported intellectualization of IPS2 is proposed as
depicted in Fig. 2, which is constructed by 5 layers. Descriptions of organization and
function in each layer from bottom to top are as follows.
(a) Physical resource layer: With the support of embedded cloud terminal technology
and Internet of things, physical resources, including equipment, tools, materials,
engineers and so on, are able to be connected to the network. Meanwhile, con-
nection interfaces for cloud services virtual resource packaging and invocation are
also provided in this layer.

(b) Virtual resource layer: In this layer, service resources connected to the network are
collected as virtual service resources. Then, they would be packaged as cloud
service using tools of cloud service deﬁning and virtualization, and released to cloud
service center through cloud management platform. This layer provides functions
and virtual resources including storage ability, techniques base, computing ability,
communication resources, network resources, digital model library and so on.
(c) Management platform: As the console of cloud service, management platform is an
important support for management staff to monitor, supervise, analyze and opti-
mize cloud services. Cloud basic management covers the function of platform
service scheduling and distributing. Cloud platform monitoring is for the real-time
management of platform performance indicators. Cloud platform operation man-
agement is developed for supporting resource distribution and tasks assignment.
(d) Service layer: This layer integrates data and service bus of the cloud platform and
core service packages. Comprehensive intelligence service for customers, dis-
tribute agents, equipment operators, service engineers are provided from this layer.
(e) Interface layer: Base on cloud service platform, users can login through multiple
log modes and terminals, while experiencing the same service applications. Ser-
vices can be invoked form portal website, on-board terminals, mobile terminals,
PC terminals and other approaches.

Discussions and Conclusions
The servitization trend of manufacturing industry is irreversible. Under this circum-
stance, the integration of CPS in IPS2 have been proved to be effective in improving
service efﬁciency and reducing service costs. Based on the summary of investigation of
several typical servitization industry, we found that companies in these industries are
trying to build their own smart Industrial Product Service Systems by integrating CPS.
A general framework of intelligent IPS2 including 7 basic modules is proposed to
guide the service transformation for manufacturing companies. We consider that the
intellectualization of IPS2 by integrating CPS can be realized with three approaches,
which are service process automation, service activity autonomy and service resource
integration, respectively. In the meantime, the general ﬁve-layer architecture of CPS
supporting intelligent IPS2 is also presented. Companies can make a customized
version based on this proposed general architecture according to their own character-
istics and particularities.
Those main ﬁndings presented in this work, have been validated with several
cooperation projects. However, the research in this paper still needs improvements.
Achievements of this work are studied from large groups or companies, so how these
approaches can be applied to small and medium sized companies will be a new
direction for future research.

thinking, representing an advanced production power, promoting continuous evolution
in economic form and further leading to vitality of social economic entity, providing a
broad network platform for reform, innovation and development [4].
Urban public space refers to open space volume existing between building entities
in a city or groups of cities, open places for urban residents to carry out public commu‐
nication activities, serving most people; meanwhile, it is also important places for human
and nature in material communication, energy exchanges and exchange of information,
playing a signiﬁcant role of reﬂecting the city’s image. It is also called living room’ and
‘show window’ of a city [5].
Urban public space is an important part of urban space with physical attribute of the
built environment and social attribute on the background of politics, economy and
culture while the later is the determinant of the former and the former carrier and
presentation of the later. Only physical attribute is focused initially rather than social
attribute in the deﬁnition of public space which is regarded same with that of open space
and external space, etc. Carr (1992) deﬁned public space in Urban space—public space
as, “public places where people carry out functional activities or ceremony activities no
matter in daily life or seasonal festivals, making people make up society.” Physically
public space and socially public space are an integral whole according to development
of social history.

Support of Research on Urban Public Space Form Relevant
Technical Method
With development of times, multi-side dialogue between various ﬁelds has been a new
tendency of innovation and the alternative relationship between disciplines is increased
year after year gradually, in addition, crossover design method has been a new design
strategy in the current design ﬁeld. Urban design is of integration, the connotations of
which is gradually developed and redeﬁned under the background of Internet. Kevin
Linch set vitality as primary index for evaluating the quality of space form in book The
Good City Form. He deﬁned vitality in this way: the support degree of inhabitation mode
for vital functions, ecological requirements and human capacity. With development of
technology, Internet changes human behaviors in aspects of travel, social communica‐
tion, consumption and housing and so on, making increasingly strong and dynamic
subject consciousness in the creative process of urban public space design. Design
disciplines are undergoing social turns as objects of design research change from forms
to behaviors in interpersonal communication while the focus is gradually changed into
human social demands [6]. Technology in social computation such as location big data
and socially aware computing provides the studying foundation for urban public space
design under the background of Internet plus while PSPL Survey is used as the main
one in guiding urban public space design.

2.1
Location Big Data
Big data refers to polymerization of large and complex data sets. Scale and complexity
of these data sets are often beyond the ability of the current database management soft‐
ware and data processing techniques in obtaining, management, retrieval, analysis,
excavation and visualization within acceptable time. Location big data, LBD is an
important part of big data. One key point for smart cities is to establish a ubiquitous
urban computing system, which involves three major aspects of ubiquitous mapping,
location big data analysis and service providing. Therefore, analytic processing and
assistant decision of big data have become the key issues in smart cities implementation
and urban geographic situation analysis [7].
2.2
Social Perception Computation and Design Research
Socially aware computing is aimed at carrying out real-time awareness and identiﬁcation
of social individual behaviors, analyzing, mining characteristics and rules of social
interaction, assisting individual social behaviors and supporting the interaction, commu‐
nication and cooperation of the community by large scale multi-type sensor devices
increasingly deployed in human living space [8].
Social aware computing focused on using advanced computer science and tech‐
nology to be aware of individual behaviors and group interaction in reality, understand
the activity patterns of human society and provide intelligent assistant and support for
individual and group interaction. Social internet analysis, machine learning, data mining
and other methods are adopted to analyze group social interaction; socially aware
computing is applied in aspects of urban social interwork, intelligent transport manage‐
ment, urban planning and development and so on.
2.3
Assessment Guidelines – PSPL
“Public Space - Public Life” survey method (PSPL Survey) is the main one adopted by
Jan Gehl in his research on “the relationship between public space and public life” and
later guidance in design. The method is aimed at providing basis for design and trans‐
formation of public space and further creating public space with high quality, meeting
the demands of citizens in their developing public life by eﬀectively understanding and
grasping human activities and characteristics of their behaviors in public space based
on results of analysis combining the quantitative and the qualitative [9].
As an assessment method of quality and citizens’ living conditions in term of urban
public space, this method is popular and easy to understand, evaluating public space
quality and public living conditions to great extent. People are studied in their daily
public life and usage of public space to discover the relationship between public space
and life while data collection, processing and analysis are carried out for ﬁnal usage
through observation, interview and record of people in their activities and state of
activity. This method is adopted in public space transformation project in New York
and nine planning countermeasures and suggestions are proposed after research and

Research on Sharing Interactive Mode of Urban Public Space
3.1
The Design Framework of the Sharing Interactive Patterns of Urban
Public Space
Design research on urban public space focuses on the interactive form of human expe‐
riences and participation by modern tech means under the background of information
society and Internet plus. It is of characteristics of interactivity, participatory, science
and technology. It is necessary to carry out deep researches on some core conceptions
and theories from perspective of urban design, architectural planning theory, sociology,
computer science and psychology and so on.
From the perspective of design research, analysis is made of interactive relationship
between human, human and environment, human and objects in urban public space
design based on direct support from such computer science as location big data and
social perception, basis for implementation of usage of public space. PSPL Survey is an
assessment method mainly for public life and public space, putting the space to good
use and meeting the relevant demands of citizens in better harmony with the people-
oriented design conception. The design framework of sharing interactive modes of urban
public space and its content are as follows in Table 1.

Public Space Application Based on Interactive Behaviors
The value of public space is realized in people’s participation and interaction and urban
public space design under the background of Internet plus is design of people’s lifestyle
in the information age in fact. In term of interaction between people, urban public space
design focuses on generation of information content, collection, share and feedback of
data, in which people’s participation and cooperation are necessary. At present, more
and more design research begins to focus on mobile internet and the new way it provides
for urban public space design. According to the current research, that obtaining the
public’s interaction and feedback as well as the way of applying the public data eﬀec‐
tively is to be addressed urgently.
For example, I Love Beijing—online map and mobile app, it is used by urban main‐
tenance personnel to cover such urban problems as road depression and lamp breakage,
etc. Beijing Chengguan create I Love Beijing, city administration map public service
platform based on theory of Innovation 2.0 and People’s city, people manage while my
territory, I control. At present, I Love Beijing has four functions: ﬁrstly, tip-oﬀs,
complaints, counsels, suggestions can be carried out directly through our website, city
administration map as well as telephones, mail multi-channel accesses. Secondly, serv‐
ices of combination between dredging and blocking. The one proposed is convenience
vegetable markets as more than 600 vegetable markets in Beijing are covered on the
app. These markets are irregular and it is hard for the municipal government to trace
their market hours, vegetable varieties and other information. Beijing residents are able
to make scores and comments on market, correct error contents and add new ones, for
example, information on market hours, through I Love Beijing. Thirdly, government
aﬀair maintenance and compilation system, through which the public are able to carry
out compilations of the policies we upload, including giving policy suggestions.
Fourthly, open data. We upload such data online as information on vegetable market to
it and the data involved is original. Figure 1 is “I Love Beijing” for Smart City Admin‐
istration: Cloud – Terminal Supporting Platform. Figure 2 is “I Love Beijing” for iPhone
and Android: Mobile Public Service APP.

Public Space Application Based on Innovative Behaviors
Urban public space design must be fully people oriented, combine with environment to
learn people’s behavior pattern and mental tendency on one hand, and realize environ‐
ment’s guidance of people on the other hand. With rapid improvement of big data anal‐
ysis ability and development of social media based on geographic information coding,
new method and data make the eﬀective measurement of urban street design and its
attractively touchable. Innovative behaviors are requirement of city’s humanization
more as well as shaping experience city and dynamic city.
Such as based on geographical position and social function of application - Gaode
navigation, it is an oﬄine mobile navigation software for car-owners with distinguishing
features of safety, easy to use and eﬃciency. Gaode map has created the best “living
map” by using advanced technology for the users. That is, the design concept of human
nature, rich interface reminder, clear voice guidance, beautiful interface and good navi‐
gation experience. Various depth POI points are more than 26,000,000, such as food,
hotels, shopping malls and so on, and other all-round vast life information available for
the search query, like clothing, living, transportation, entertainment, etc. Displaying the
real road scene on the mobile phone screen by the camera, AR living navigation overlays
road signs on the screen by using the navigation system, so that the users are able to
experience the real scene navigation. Figure 3 is AR living navigation. Figure 4 is Func‐
tion interface of Gaode.

Public Space Application Based on Inter-behavior
Inter-behavior focuses on characters and objects where the later refers to products and
tangible substances in reality associated with Internet, meeting the requirements of
interactive relationship establishment and building a bridge for interactions between
urban spaces.

Recently, the air quality in Beijing can be described with words “bad and terrible”.
The hazy weather impresses people and people begin gradually to realize that air dust
is harmful to their body. Therefore, people pay more and more attention to PM2.5 as
these ﬁne particles are more harmful to human body and air quality, beyond imagination.
In such a situation, mobile apps for providing oﬃcially air quality indexes appear
naturally, very popular among the citizens. Some students and designers also participate
in research and development of low-cost sensor devices which are available for citizens
to measure air quality. Air.Air! is a convenient air quality monitor access to smartphone
with display of regions with poor air quality and it will give a warning through smart‐
phone. Pecking design students develop a air pollution monitor, the color of which
changes gradually according to the degree of air pollution, making technical information
more visual [10]. FLOAT smart kite designed by a designer in Beijing can measure the
air quality over the city and make air quality map [11]. Figures 5 and 6 is about Air.Air!

Questions and Discussions
Location big data and socially aware computing technology applied in the sharing inter‐
active mode of public space enable urban space design to be with more science and
technology, interactivity, vitality and share, etc. In term of urban public space sustainable
design, it is also necessary to focus and consider the virtual space shape and humani‐
zation. With rise of Internet plus, more and more designers and urban planners as well
as audience begin to link mobile network with traditional industries in social life, active
the public space design mode, enriching the audience’s participation modes in public
space and promoting communication between the designer and the audience. Audience’s
participation and feedback are required in public space under the background of internet
in order to implement eﬀectively sustainable operation of urban public space sharing
interaction.
4.1
Improve Public Space Experience Based on Socially Aware Computing
and PSPL Survey
The users’ requirements of public space are changeable and dynamic. With internet’s
entrance in life, people’s living habits are changed and it becomes hard for traditional

public space design to meet the demands of its users. Research on public space design
provides evaluations of various activities in public space and proposes design and
reconstruction basis based on combination of rational cognition, perceptual experience
and empirical analysis according to relevant users, group behaviors, data information
and survey and analysis by combing with PSPL survey. However, it is unclear about
how to establish public space quality standard and experience eﬀects. It will be helpful
to learn and analyze users, groups’ behaviors and feelings, understand social activity
modes of users and groups, providing intelligent auxiliary and supports and the infor‐
mation feedback help designers’ optimization of spatial experience based on social
perception computation. From perspective of design method, means of design are
updated gradually and traditional means of design are suﬃcient to meet the demands of
the current newly emerging design strategies. Urban design of integrity and establish‐
ment of platform for the sharing interactive mode of public space and solutions under
the background of internet meets the demands of people in their interaction and appli‐
cation in spatial activities to greater extent. In addition, the design method combining
social awareness and PSPL survey together is helpful for improving public spatial expe‐
rience design.
4.2
Improve Public Space Innovation Based on Technology Means
Modern society has developed informational, omnidirectionally with digitization and
intellectualization, marked by ‘numbers’ and ‘net’. American scholar Negroponte
always said, “the community consisting of internet users will be the tendency in daily
life, the population structure will also become more and more similar with that of the
world itself” [12]. It is can imaged that urban residents in future will complete their daily
life through internet and changes in production and lifestyle of cities will lead to urban
morphology—structure’s fundamental transformation. With development of big data,
transparent computation and VR technology and application of computer technology,
new technology will redeﬁne digital public space and bring unlimited space for future
public space design as well and virtual space will be closer to our daily life in the future.
Object images of urban space gives people subject image through their senses, that is,
cities in their minds [13]. Human subject image plays signiﬁcantly important role in
urban public space creative design. Use new technical means to excavate psychological
perception, put social perception technology to big use and promote the audience’s
participation in public space by catering to the audience with new interactive mode.

Conclusion
Research on public space design under the background of internet plus is cross-discipline
involving urban design, construction planning, design research and computer science,
etc. With continuous development of new technology’s connotation and application,
human participation will be required in future spatial structure to greater extent and the
public will be the audience of space as well as participants in space design. Public space
design is widened in breadth and depth based on location big data, social awareness and

PSPL Survey. The quality of public spatial from will be further improved if the tech‐
nology, means and thinking of internet are integrated into traditional urban public space
design. Interpretation of artiﬁcial space and space’s shaping people and reﬂection of
share interactive space applications with characteristics of participation and immersion
by combining factors of technology and humanization will be another topic for public
space design.

Abstract. In this paper, we describe the development of an autonomous
tracking system to be used in the home of the elderly population living
with neurodegenerative disorders including dementia. The technology
advancement has potential to produce low-cost solutions for elder-care
in a residential setting. Our approach is based on the concept that body
tracking interventional systems can be developed by utilizing low-cost
technological solutions aﬀordable to the aged population and can be
deployed in the residential settings. We are exploring the usefulness of
such systems in providing information that can assist with assessment of
performance of activities of daily living in the periods between hospital
clinic visits. Management of neurodegenerative disorders such as demen-
tia and multiple sclerosis involve periodic review of patients at a specialist
clinic. At these reviews the clinician solicits information about activities
of daily living over the preceding period. This period can be a long inter-
val of 6 to 12 months. When self-reports of activity are compared with
independent objective measures, discrepancies are found in many areas
of healthcare. This can cause diﬃculties in management of treatment.
The autonomous sensor tracking systems developed here could improve
care by giving clinicians objective assessments of relapses in the intervals
between clinic visits. This could reduce the time spent on in- clinic exam-
ination as clinicians can use objective measures instead of semistructured
interviews aimed at eliciting an accurate history. This will allow more
time to spend on well-being and treatment options.

Introduction
Clinicians often rely on self-reporting of patients for the interval between the
last hospital-visit to the present hospital-visit, for the assessment of performance
of the patient to track the neurological disease progression. The self-reporting
assessment system has been criticized by many clinicians and is prone to discrep-
ancies in many areas of healthcare system. In neurological disorders such as Mul-
tiple Sclerosis (MS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) personality changes
occur e.g. dramatic increase in social submissiveness and introversion. There are
no studies which can quantify the physical activity changes at home for such
FTD or MS population. It is of paramount importance to clinicians to objec-
tively quantify the behavioural features (over an extended period of activity in
a home situation) for the accurate diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, the move-
ment assessment of patients living with neurodegenerative disorders such as MS
is an important factor for clinicians to monitor disease progression and respond
for timely intervention. A low-cost, unobtrusive sensorized system capable of
autonomously detecting patients behavioral state at home could help signiﬁ-
cantly improve accuracy of assessments and hence improve quality of care for
these patients. In order to achieve this goal we need to develop a system which
can relate the in-home physical activity to activity within the clinical test.
Wearable devices unarguably can detect the patient’s living state at home,
these include pedometers, specialized accelerometers, etc. [7]. However, the
biggest disadvantage of wearable devices is compliance with the need to wear or
carry them. There are also issues with collecting continuous sets of data as well
as battery life. Environmentally mounted sensors that make passive observations
of patients while at home overcome many of these deﬁcits. Several studies have
discussed the non-wearable preference of older adults [4]. Numerous researchers
have looked at the use of environmentally mounted sensors, such as vibration
sensors mounted on the ﬂoor [16], infrared passive sensors [15], acoustic sen-
sors [10], and video streaming (an intrusion into privacy), including traditional
cameras [9] and thermal imaging sensors [12]. Studies have found that privacy
concerns of older adults to vision-based monitoring systems may be addressed
by the use of appropriate privacy preserving processing techniques, such as sil-
houettes [3].
Early reports suggest the Kinect can identify pose [1,6,11], simple step-
ping movements [5] and postural control [2] in healthy adults, although some
have raised concerns about the accuracy of the skeleton model estimation dur-
ing unconventional body postures or when using wheelchairs or walkers [8,13].
There is also growing evidence for the use of exercise-based computer games
(exergames) to retrain motor function in people with Parkinson’s disease
(PD) [14], although evidence of their safety and eﬃcacy are yet to be estab-
lished [11]. Exergaming as a therapeutic tool that incorporates functional,
purposeful and engaging exercise in a quantiﬁable and reliable way that also
encourages high volumes of practice and potentially improved motivation and
adherence [12]. A player’s movement can be recorded whilst playing a game using
the Kinect, allowing clinicians to ensure the patient perform exercises correctly.

Can Autonomous Sensor Systems Improve the Well-being of People Living
651
In this research paper, we demonstrate proof of concept of obtaining early
stage experimental results of physical activity obtained in a domestic setting.
We demonstrate an unobtrusive continuous gait monitoring system based on
the Microsoft Kinect sensor that could measure the gait of older adults, in their
homes, during normal daily activity. However, the output of the system, mea-
sures of in-home gait speed, stride time, stride length, etc., is not easily inter-
pretable, as such parameters have never before been available. Thus, either a
large scale study to directly relate these in-home gait parameters to health sta-
tus is needed, or a methodology to relate the parameters to existing well studied
and understood domains needs to be developed. For this work, the Kinect-based
in-home gait system was deployed in a residential setting. While the systems were
installed, the participants also completed preliminary walking assessment con-
sisting of standard mobility test, such as a short maximum speed walk (SMSW).
The SMSW test has been widely studied and shown to be a good measure of
functional ability as well as an indicator of falls risk in the elderly [7,15]. As
such, mapping of the residential gait data to this well understood domain would
facilitate interpretation of the data by a clinician.
This paper presents a methodology for and results from estimating walk time
from in-home gait data, speciﬁcally walking speed, collected by the Kinect-based
systems. The purpose is not to measure SMSW time directly, but to map the
in-home gait data to a domain that clinicians understand; and to assess the
accuracy of the mapping with regards to what could theoretically be expected.
Although this paper focuses on mapping in-home gait speed to SMSW time,
the approach could be used with any data source, and any well studied domain.
Section 2 of this paper discusses the materials and methodology used in the
area of in-home gait and functional ability assessment. Section 3 contains the
results of estimating SMSW time from in-home gait speed and compares it to
estimates made using SMSW measured by a clinician at the same time. Finally,
a discussion of the results and their implications is given in Sect. 4.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Ethics Statement
No video recordings during any task were made in this study. The Kinect sensor’s
numerical data was recorded that directly related to walking movements. The
numerical data was de-identiﬁed, representing joint positions, were stored in the
database for further analysis. Volunteers were researchers at the University of
Salford, Manchester and Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.
2.2
Second Generation Microsoft Kinect V2 Based Sensing
The Microsoft Kinect is a camera-based sensor primarily used to directly control
computer games through body movement. The Kinect tracks the position of the
limbs and body without the need for handheld controllers or force platforms.

652
T. Gulrez et al.
Use of a depth sensor also allows the Kinect to capture three-dimensional move-
ment patterns. We propose that this system has the potential for remote assess-
ment of movement symptoms in people with neurological disorders, exempliﬁed
by MS and FTD symptoms.
2.3
Data Collection
The data acquired during subject monitoring included 3-D body joint informa-
tion provided by Microsoft Kinect V2 at a rate of 30 frames per second. The
data acquisition was supported by an in-house developed application written in
MS Visual studio 2015 C++ using the Kinect SDK v2.0. Microsoft Kinect sensor
with the use of its software development kit (SDK) provides three-dimensional
skeletal data on 26 joint positions over time. We chose to record the positions
of four skeletal joints namely, spine-base, hip, knee and ankle center of gravity
or leg movements, which are potential walking velocity indicators. With 7 joints
(spine-base, left and right joints for hip, knee and ankle) and 3 ﬂoating point
values (real numbers) representing the x, y, and z positions for each joint, each
motion frame was expressed as a 21-element position vector. The 3D position
(x, y, z) of a joint is expressed in the position coordinate system of the Kinect
sensor and the units are in meters (as shown in Fig. 1). The walking speed rely
on motion dynamics so our system is view-independent, i.e., there is no need to
express the recorded positions in the coordinate system of the subject’s body.
The dynamic of each joint is computed using the variation of position of the
joint over time. In the ﬁrst step, each joint motion, deﬁned by the sequence of
3D positions, is replaced by the distance between each frame particular joint
that varies from 0 . . . k, where k is the number of frames in a performed motion.

Microsoft Kinect. (b) Skeletal tracking and joints in x,y - plane.

Can Autonomous Sensor Systems Improve the Well-being of People Living
653
The instantaneous velocity of motion for a particular joint is calculated as the
resultant of x, y, and z positions over all frames that represent a motion. The
instantaneous velocity Vinst for a given 3D motion is computed as follows:
Vinst = d(x, y, z)
dt
(1)
Vinst = 1
T

(x(k) −x(k −1))2 + (y(k) −y(k −1))2 + (z(k) −z(k −1))2
(2)
where T is the sampling interval and equals the reciprocal of the sampling fre-
quency (1/30 = 0.0333) s and k is the number of joint data points. The subject’s
kinematic properties can be extracted using the value of the joint positions, and
if required joint angles, angular velocities and accelerations can be calculated
based on the time history of the joint positions. Moreover, to remove possi-
ble artefacts in the joint position data, a 2D moving average ﬁlter was used to
smooth the data (as shown in Fig. 2).

steps occur. A moving average smoothed ﬁlter output is also shown in black. (Color

2.4
Kinect Based Short Maximum Speed Walk (SMSW)
Assessment
The short maximum speed walk (SMSW) assessment at Salford Royal NHS
Foundation Trust (hospital), is usually carried out in a narrow corridor. The
Kinect sensor was mounted on 2.5 m height tripod at the end of the same corridor
of the hospital, thereby covering a rectangular area of roughly 3.5 × 2.5 m (see
Fig. 3(a)). Each subject was tested in an evenly lit environment in a single session
of sequential tests as shown in the Fig. 3(a) and (b). All subjects were given the
same instruction as speciﬁed in a standardized test procedure: “Walk as fast as

654
T. Gulrez et al.
you can towards the sensor”. The starting point for walking was approximately
three meters outside the detection range of the sensor. We postulated that this
would allow the subject to reach maximum walking speed before reaching the
measurement zone. The start was given as a voice command. An automatic
computer-generated sound signalled the subject to end the experiment after
leaving the opposite edge of the sensor measurement zone. Similarly, the same
software was used to calculate the time taken from the initial point of start to
the end point 25-foot mark. The time taken to complete a timed 25-feet walk
(T25-FW) gives a quantitative mobility and leg function measure, based on a
25 feet walking distance.

Residential Autonomous Sensing System
A Microsoft Kinect sensor and computer were deployed in a residential apart-
ment as part of a volunteer study at researchers’ house. The Kinect was installed
on a 2.5 m height tripod, which can easily be placed on any shelf a few inches
below the ceiling (height 2.5 m), above the front door. This arrangement has
proven to be unobtrusive to the residents, with most indicating that they do not
notice the equipment after a short period of time. The output of the Kinect based
residential autonomous systems was a dataset in which each entry corresponds to
a joint position of the skeletal movement that occurred in the apartment (Fig. 4).

Results
The participants performed a set of walking movements which involved spine
base, hips, knee and ankle joints. Figures 2 and 5 represent the time series of
spine base, hip and ankle positions (which compound the walking movement)
and the root mean squared errors (RMSE) are shown in Fig. 6. Joint movements
are reported in Figs. 2 and 5 represents the evolution of the walking movement
where as the continuous curve is the ﬁltered output of the each joint position.
The results in Figs. 2 and 5 show the walking movement from one of the exper-
iments using the Kinect based system during the assessment at the hospital. A
correlation coeﬃcient r and RMSE was calculated between the joint (spine-base,

occur simultaneously.

Conclusions
In this an early stage of proof of concept study, we investigated the applicability
and feasibility of Microsoft Kinect v2 assisted motion analysis during the hos-
pital walking gait assessments and in-home monitoring. Our primary question
was whether skeletal tracking data recorded by the Kinect based system would
yield reliable information for clinicians to assess the walking gait from in-home
monitoring system. Using the spine-base, hip and ankle joints, we established
the test SMSW to analyse person’s gait at maximum walking speed. The linear
distance covered by the recognition area was only 3.5 m (see Fig. 1 and Table 1),
and consequently only a few steps of each subject were analysed. Despite this
short walking and recording time, the overall detection quality of the target
hip-centre joint of the SMSW over time was excellent.
The noise from the Microsoft Kinect based system was ﬁltered out by apply-
ing a custom-built moving average ﬁlter developed during the analysis of this
experiment. After ﬁltering the SMSW average walking speed parameter was
excellent and on par with T25FW. An analysis of skeletal data from spine-base,
hip and ankle joints was performed for the walking assessment in healthy sub-
jects. Our ﬁndings show that Kinect-based motion analysis is also feasible in
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and can detect gait diﬀerences in comparison
to healthy controls.

Abstract. Chinese people have their own set of medical beliefs. However, it
could cause misunderstanding during cross-cultural communication, especially
under clinical settings. In this case study, we designed an educational game
Kitchen KungFu, which incorporates knowledge of Chinese medical beliefs into
the rules of match-3 games like Candy Crush Saga. Speciﬁcally, the game
presents yin-yang theory and the cold-hot foods culture. Ten international par-
ticipants were recruited to play the game and give feedback. Quantitative and
qualitative analyses showed that this educational game increased participants’
agreement with and knowledge of Chinese medical beliefs. As an exploration of
employing gamiﬁcation to promote cross-cultural understanding, Kitchen
KungFu’s design and evaluation process could provide valuable reference for
future studies.

Introduction
1.1
Chinese Medical Beliefs
Chinese people have their unique beliefs about healthcare and medicine. These medical
beliefs are shaped by various factors. Among others, Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM) plays an important role. For example, theories of Zang-fu (viscera) and Ching-lo
(meridian), and theory of Chi (energy) constitute ancient people’s understanding of
human’s physical structure [1]. Besides TCM, religions and philosophies also bring
profound inﬂuence. For example, yin-yang theory and ﬁve-element theory, which are
stemmed from Taoism, shape the basic logic of traditional Chinese medical system.
Fatalism, which is advocated by Buddhism, could affect patients’ response to certain
diseases and medical treatments [2]. And Confucianism emphasizes family values and
respect to doctors [3]. Meanwhile, some social and cultural customs like Fengshui and
fortune-telling also have impact on people’s medical beliefs and practices [4].
1.2
Cross-Cultural Communication
Even as western medicine is globally dominant, Chinese people still, to some extent,
hold to their own medical beliefs. Undoubtedly this cultural uniqueness shapes

Chinese’s cultural identity. However, it can also result in misunderstanding during
cross-cultural communication, especially under clinical settings. For example, a
western physician may not understand when his Chinese patient says he feels “numb”
in his body, which is caused by inadequate “blood and energy” [5]. Or, due to Chi-
nese’s holistic view regarding body and mind as unitary, patients with mental illness
like depression tend to describe their diseases as physical symptoms. In that situation,
western doctors might fail to diagnose the true causes [6].
To avoid the trouble, some immigrants would choose Chinese clinicians or even
return to home countries for medical treatment [5], which leads to inconvenience and
further cultural isolation. Therefore, raising awareness on Chinese medical beliefs is a
worthy effort to bridge the cultural gap.
Though introductory materials on Chinese medical beliefs are not rare, most of
them are in the form of books and articles. On mobile platform, some applications
featuring TCM are also available, for example, Eastland Herb, Traditional Chinese
Medicine and TCM Herbal Formula Library. However, most of them are abbreviated
versions of medical books or lists of diseases, cures and herbs, which lack interaction
and entertainment. In order to address the gap, we designed an educational game called
Kitchen KungFu, and evaluated its effect on changing player’ level of agreement with
and knowledge of Chinese medical beliefs.

Ideation
2.1
Theme
Among various Chinese medical beliefs, yin-yang theory is a core concept as well as
the most inﬂuential one even among the highly westernized Chinese people [5]. It
stems from Taoism, representing the balance between two opposite forces. In foods,
yin-yang is demonstrated as their cold or hot properties. People take proper foods
according to their own cold or hot “body constitution” to keep the balance [1]. Con-
sidering that food properly demonstrates the essence of Chinese medical beliefs, as well
as stimulates people’s interest, we employed it as our design’s starting point.
2.2
Gamiﬁcation
We decided to apply gamiﬁcation to introduce Chinese medical beliefs because it could
stimulate users’ interest and convey knowledge at the same time. According to
Deterding et al., gamiﬁcation is using “game design elements in non-game contexts”
[7]. Within the broad category of game, educational games are those designed to
facilitate learning [8]. Using game elements in learning environment could increase
players’ incentives and interest, resulting in higher-level memorization and lasting
inﬂuence [7, 9].
Among various game genres, we based our design on match-3 game, or matching
tile game, whose core mechanics is to make and eliminate combos of three or more
same items by swaping adjacent items. Such games include Candy Crush Saga and
Bejeweled. The simplicity of match-3 game enables it to be easily played and spread
660

across different cultures [10]. Meanwhile, its “matching” nature provides a suitable
base for us to add more complicated rules and demonstrate Chinese medical
philosophy.

Kitchen KungFu
3.1
Prototype
The game is named as Kitchen KungFu, indicating that it is about both food and
Chinese culture. A cartoon panda is designed as narrator, introducing background
knowledge and rules. Overall, the game content consists of two sections: 1. cold and
hot foods 2. food and body interaction. Within each section, there is one warm-up
exercise where related concepts and theories are introduced. In the ﬁrst section
warm-up, players learn about yin-yang theory and cold-hot foods, and anticipate the
category of some common foods (shown in Fig. 1). In the second section, players
complete a simple quiz to determine their body constitution, and then learn about the
relationship between body and foods (shown in Fig. 2).
Following the warm-up exercise, there are several match-3 game levels from easy
to hard. The main interactive area is a 7 * 7 grid, where various food items are
randomly distributed. The goal is to eliminate enough cold or hot foods according to
instructions. In the ﬁrst section, a yin-yang shaped pan is designed as status bar to
visualize the connection between food and medical philosophy. As players eliminate
more and more target foods, the corresponding hemisphere increases from empty to
full. In the second section, players are required to eliminate target foods to neutralize
cold or hot types of body constitutions. The abstract body constitution is presented as
ice or ﬁre icons.
Fig. 1. Warm-up exercise in the ﬁrst section

Since the whole game context is about food and Chinese culture, some power-ups
are designed with cultural implications as well. For example, the “family dinner”
power-up will lengthen the countdown by ﬁve seconds. It indicates Chinese people’s
emphasis on having meals with family (Table 1).

To create an immersive playing experience, we incorporated background music
loops and various sound effects into the game. As players conduct each operation, there
are sounds of cheers or regrets, according to whether target or non-target foods are
eliminated. In this aspect, Kitchen KungFu is different from common match-3 games,
where positive feedback is plenty while negative feedback is limited [10]. Since an
important goal of our game is to help players differentiate food categories, we used
both positive and negative sounds to assist players’ memorization (Fig. 3).
3.2
User Testing
In order to evaluate how Kitchen KungFu would inﬂuence non-Chinese people’s
agreement with and knowledge of Chinese medical beliefs, we conducted a user test.
Ten participants were recruited, all international students studying in Tsinghua
University. They came from different countries including Thailand, New Zealand,
Brazil, Netherlands, France, Morocco, Bangladesh and Iran. They were instructed to
play the game, and complete a questionnaire both before and after the game. An
in-depth interview followed up to understand participants’ detailed opinions on Chi-
nese medical beliefs and the game.
The pre-game questionnaire consisted of ﬁve statements on Chinese medical
beliefs. Participants chose their level of agreement with each statement on a 5-point
Likert scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. The ﬁrst four statements were
set according to Chew’s research on Chinese cultural beliefs, assessing participants’
agreement with certain TCM concepts and practices [11]. The ﬁfth statement measures
participants’ willingness to consult TCM for themselves (shown in Table 2). The
post-game questionnaire included the same ﬁve statements and four questions assessing
players’ memorization of related knowledge. They were all multiple-choice questions,
asking about the categories each food belongs to and medical solutions to speciﬁc
scenarios, all of which are explicitly demonstrated in the game.

Results and Analysis
4.1
Data Interpretation
We calculated each participant’s level of agreement with Chinese medical beliefs by
averaging their answers to the ﬁrst ﬁve statements. Before the game, the mean of the
ten participants’ agreement level is 3.24 (SD = 0.68). After the game, the mean is 3.82
(SD = 0.58). A paired t-test was conducted to measure the difference of agreement
before and after the game (p = 0.056) (shown in Table 3). Considering that the number
of participants is limited, the actual agreement level change was more signiﬁcant than
the p-value indicated. While most participants’ rated higher after the game, three
persons’ answers remained the same. Abdellah, a player from Morocco, rated low on
the second and third statements both before and after the game. During the interview,
he explained he disagreed with the cause of fever and the childbirth practice, and since
the game did not explain those aspects, his answers did not change after it. Shaya was
familiar with Chinese medical beliefs before the game. She specially mentioned that the
interval between two questionnaires was too short that for a person who already agreed
with Chinese medical beliefs, the change could be insigniﬁcant.

We also found that in certain cases, participants’ agreement with the statements
might not reﬂect their agreement with Chinese medical beliefs. For example, Vincent
from France chose 2 to the statement “fever is due to excessive heat inside the body”
before the game and 1 after it. He explained that since playing sports and warming up
the body will help relive the fever, the fever was instead caused by too much coldness.
As a result, though Vincent believed in yin-yang theory, he used it to reach an opposite
conclusion.
As to the memorization of knowledge, the last four questions have an average
accuracy of 82 %, 70 %, 80 % and 70 % respectively. According to the interview,
most participants did not know about cold-hot food culture nor had related knowledge
before, though many of them had heard of yin-yang theory. Thus the result indicates
that the game was effective in imparting knowledge and helping players develop a
short-time memorization.
However, there are limitations on the sample’s number and representativeness. All
participants are students in Tsinghua University, from bachelor to PhD degrees. Most
of them are from Asian and European countries, which could not comprehensively
reﬂect international players’ situations.
4.2
Educational Game
Overall, each player took an average of 25 min to ﬁnish Kitchen KungFu. Though they
were told in advance that they could have certain difﬁcult levels skipped, many insisted
on ﬁnishing the whole game independently and enjoyed meeting the challenge. After
the game, most participants expressed strong interest in the concept of educational
game. They liked to learn while having fun, and were ready to know more about
Chinese medical beliefs. One participant remarked that Kitchen KungFu was different
from ordinary match-3 games like Candy Crush Saga, “Besides speed and observation,
it adds another dimension. You need to remember the knowledge presented before to
better pass each level.”
Meanwhile, the interview provided insights into the balance of entertainment and
learning in an educational game. One participant commented that he did not strive to
memorize speciﬁc hot or cold foods once he found that eliminating non-target items
would not reduce scores. This might suggest that the ratio of positive and negative
feedback should be given more consideration.
Other factors also inﬂuence participants’ interest and learning results. For example,
players’ technological familiarity and previous experience with match-3 games largely
determined their initial inclination towards Kitchen KungFu. Those who were already
fans of match-3 games, or those conﬁdent that they would quickly learn the game
expressed a higher morale. But two participants expressed worries before the game for
they seldom played mobile games before. One of them failed several levels and became
a bit depressed, while the other gradually gathered conﬁdence and passion as he
became familiar with various operations.
Some usability issues, like the device’s slow response and certain levels’ high
degree of difﬁculty, also had negative affect on players. Such observations and feed-
back provide direction for the game’s future improvement.

4.3
Cultural Diversity
Though western medicine is prevalent across the world, the interview reveals partici-
pants’ notion of medical diversity. Instead of taking western medicine as the only cure,
many participants were open to solutions from other cultures, including TCM and
traditional medicine from their own countries. Several participants expressed their
preference to herbal medicine over western medicine, because herbs were more “nat-
ural” and would cause fewer side effects. A participant from Iran noted that recently in
her country, instead of seeking only western healthcare, people and government were
placing more emphasis on traditional medicine industry.
Traditional and modern medicine’s efﬁcacy is still a topic under heated discussion,
but it is not our focus in this study. However, as medical beliefs are a facet of culture,
this conveys an encouraging message that these players are, to some extent, embracing
cultural diversity.
5
Conclusion
Kitchen KungFu is an exploration to present cultural values through gamiﬁcation. By
designing a game that incorporates Chinese medical beliefs and conducting a user test
after the game, our study provides valuable reference to gamiﬁcation’s potential for
improving cross-cultural communication.
In future study, we will reﬁne the game’s visual design and improve its usability.
We will also expand its educational content from yin-yang theory to more compre-
hensive themes like ﬁve-element theory, nutrition diet and Chinese cuisine. Meanwhile,
we hope to add more variety to the game mechanics.

Introduction
We study the problem of analyzing and classifying frontal view gait video data.
A study on the human gait analysis is very important in the ﬁelds of the
health/sports management, medical research, and the biometrics.
Gait analysis is mainly based on motion capture system and video data.
The motion capture system can give the precise measurements of trajectories
of moving objects, but it requires the laboratory environments and this system
cannot be used in the ﬁeld study. On the other hand, the video camera is handy
to observe the gait motion in the ﬁeld study.
From the standpoint of health/medical research area. Gage [3] proposed brain
paralysis gait analysis using gait video data. Kadaba et al. [5] discussed impor-
tance of lower limb in the human gait using gait video data too. Many gait
analysis have recently analyzing using video analysis software (e.g. Dartﬁsh,
Contemplas, Silicon Coach). For example, Borel et al. [2] and Grunt et al. [4]
proposed infantile paralysis gait analysis using lateral view gait video data.
From the standpoint of statistics, Olshen et al. [11] proposed the bootstrap
estimation for conﬁdence intervals of the functional data with application to the
gait cycle data observed by the motion capture system.

Young and Elderly, Normal and Pathological Gait Analysis

However, most studies have not focused on frontal view gait analysis, because
such data has many restrictions on analysis based on the ﬁlming conditions.
The video data ﬁlmed from the frontal view is diﬃcult to analyze, because
the subject getting close in to the camera, and data includes the scale-changing
parameters [1,6]. To cope with this, Okusa et al. [10] and Okusa & Kamakura [7]
proposed a registration for scales of moving object using the method of nonlinear
least squares, but Okusa et al. [10] and Okusa & Kamakura [7] did not focus on
the human leg swing. Okusa & Kamakura [9] focus on the gait analysis using
arm and leg swing model with estimated parameters and application to the nor-
mal/pathological gait analysis. However, their models have many of parameters,
and it raise calculation cost and instability of parameter estimation.
On the other hand, from the stand point of biometrics, many of this area’s
researchers mainly using human silhouette shape for the gait authentication.
However, they did not focus on the scale registration in the frontal view gait
analysis case. In this area, just normalize the human silhouette and it apply to
the gait authentication. It is reasonable to suppose that the normalize of the
human silhouette lost a lot of gait information.
In this study, we focus on the scale changing of human shape in the frontal
view gait analysis, we estimate scale parameters using the statistical registration
and modeling on a video data. To demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our method,
we apply our model to the frontal view gait analysis. As a result, our model
shows good performance for the scale estimation and gait analysis.
The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss
the advantage and problem of frontal view gait analysis. In Sect. 3, primarily, we
describe archetype model proposed in Okusa & Kamakura [8]. Next, we discuss
the modiﬁed model for the shape scale registration. In Sect. 4, we validate our
modiﬁed model using the frontal view gait analysis. We conclude with a summary
in Sect. 5.

Frontal View Gait Data
In this section, we describe an overview of frontal view gait data. Many of gait
analysis using lateral view gait data (e.g. Borel et al. [2], Grunt et al. [4], Barnich
& Droogenbroeck [1], Lee et al. [6]), because observed data not includes the scale-
changing parameters, it is easy to detect the human gait features. In a corridor
like structure, the subject is approaching a camera. Such case is diﬃcult observe
lateral view gait.
In a lateral view gait, at least two cycles or four steps are needed. For more
robust estimation of the period of walking, about 8 m is recommended. To cap-
ture this movement, the camera distance required is about 9 m. Practically, hav-
ing such a wide space is diﬃcult. On the other hand, frontal view gait video is
easy to observe 8 m (or more) gait steps [6].
Figure 1 is an example of frontal view gait data recorded by Fig. 2 situation.
Figure 1 illustrates diﬃculty of frontal view gait analysis. This ﬁgure indicates
the subjects getting close in to the camera and the subjects scaling is changing.

Modeling of Frontal View Gait Data
3.1
Preprocessing
The raw video data is diﬃcult to observe subject width and height time-series
behavior, because data contains background. We separate subject from back-
ground using background subtraction method (Eq. 1).
Δ(T )(p, q) = |I(T )(p, q) −B(p, q)|,
T = 1, ..., (n −1),
Δ(T )(p, q) =

1
(Δ(T )(p, q) > Th)
0
(Otherwise).

Here, Δ(T ) is an background subtraction image, I(T ), B are grey scaled video
data image and background image at frame T respectively. (p, q) is the pixel
coordinate.
Generally, this method is diﬃcult to apply to the ﬁeld study data (e.g. secu-
rity camera), because the all background pixels are not static. However, in the
experimental environment case, background pixels are tunable. We can assume
that inter-frame subtraction method is reasonable. In the ﬁeld study data,
many of researchers are using “dynamic background subtraction” method (see
Tamersoy [12], Zheng et al. [13]).
After the background subtraction, we apply the Laplacian ﬁlter to extract the
subject’s shape image. Figure 4 is background subtraction (left side) and Lapla-
cian ﬁltered image (right side) of frontal view gait data. From this ﬁgure, this
preprocessing can extract the subject shape from video data. In this research, we
focus on the subject’s width/height. We can assume that subject’s width/height
as a bounding rectangle of subject’s shape.

3.2
Relationship Between Camera and Subject
In this section, we describe archetype model proposed in Okusa & Kamakura [8].
Figure 5 shows a relationship between camera and subject. From Fig. 5, width
and height model has same structure. In this section, we describe the subject’s
width modeling. We can assume simple camera structure. We consider the virtual
screen exists between observation point and subject, and we deﬁne xi as subject
width on the virtual screen at i-th frame (i = 1, ..., n).
Here we deﬁne zi, zj as distance between observation point and subject at
i-th, j-th frame, zs as distance between observation point and virtual screen,
θxi1, θxi2 as subject angle of view from observation point at i-th frame, d as
distance between observation point and 1st frame, vi as subject speed at i-th
frame. Okusa et al. [10] deﬁned the subject length L was constant. We assume
that L has the time-series behavior and we deﬁne Li is the subject length at i-th
frame.

Fig. 5. Relationship between camera and subject
xi at i-th frame depends on θxi1, θxi2 as shown in Fig. 5.
xi = zs(tan θxi1 + tan θxi2).
(2)
Similarly, the subject length at i-th frame is
Lxi = zi(tan θxi1 + tan θxi2).
(3)
From Eqs. (2), (3), ratio between xn and xi is
xn
xi
= Lxnzi
Lxizn
(4)
Frame interval is equally-spaced (15 fps). Okusa et al. [10] assumed the aver-
age speed is constant. We can assume that average speed from i-th frame is
(n −i) = (zi −zn)/¯v, therefore zi is zi = zn + ¯v(n −i). We substitute zi
to Eq. (4)
xi =
Mxiγ
γ + (n −i)xn + ϵi,
(5)
where γ is zn/¯v, Mxi is Lxi/Lxn, ϵi is noise. From Eq. (5), predicted value ˆx(n)
i
is registration from i-th frame’s scale to n-th frame’s scale

Next, we discuss the modiﬁed model for the shape scale registration.
3.3
Modiﬁed Model for the Shape Scale Registration
Let us consider the scale of shape, it seems that subject’s width and height’s has
same relationships.
From Eq. (5), we can deﬁne subject height as
yi =
Myiγ
γ + (n −i)yn + ϵi,
(7)
where Myi is Lyi/Lyn.

We can assume that subject’s width and height are same scale changing
components γ, we can estimate common scale parameter γ from the following
nonlinear least squares equation.

Experiments and Results
In this section, we validates our modiﬁed model using the frontal view gait
authentication. To validate the eﬀectiveness of our model, we observes frontal
view walking video data (10 steps, Male, average height: 176.4 cm, sd: 3.07 cm)
and apply to our proposed model.
Figure 6 is plot of the one of the 10 subjects width (pixel) time-series behav-
ior. Here, continuous line represent ﬁtted value of Eq. 5. Similarly, Fig. 7 is plot
of subject height (pixel) time-series behavior. Here, continuous line represent ﬁt-
ted value of Eq. 7. From Figs. 6 and 7, proposed model is good ﬁtting for frontal
view gait data.

posed method keeps arm and leg swing components after the registration.

Gait Analysis
To demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our method, we conducted two sets of exper-
iments, assessing the proposed method in gait analysis for young/elderly person
and pathological gait detection. We use SONY DCR-TRV70K camera. Frame
rate of video data is 15 fps and resolution is 640 × 480.
In this paper, we focus on ˆγ (speed parameter), ( ˆP1+ ˆP2)/2 (width amplitude
parameter), and ˆb1 (height amplitude parameter).
4.2
Gait Analysis: Young Person
In this experiment we took movie of 120 subjects walking video data from frontal
view (10 steps, Male: 96 (average height: 173.24 cm, sd: 5.64 cm), Female: 24
(average height: 156.25 cm, sd: 3.96 cm)) and apply to our proposed method for
the gait analysis.
Figure 9 is plot of speed vs width amplitude vs height amplitude. Figures 10
and 11 are width amplitude vs speed and height amplitude vs speed. The impor-
tant point to note is that speed parameter ˆγ is zn/¯v. If the subject walking fast,
speed parameter ˆγ is small. From Figs. 9, 10 and 11, width amplitude vs speed
and height amplitude vs speed have a nonlinear relationship. This results means,
if the subject’s arm swing and leg swing moving strongly, subject’s walking speed
is fast.
4.3
Gait Analysis: Elderly Person
In this experiment we took movie of 60 subjects walking video data from frontal
view (10 steps/average age: 76.97sd: 4.16/pathological gait subjects; average age:

proposed method for the gait analysis. Figure 12 is a example of elderly person’s
frontal view walking data.

Fig. 13. Speed vs width amplitude vs height amplitude (elderly) (Color ﬁgure online)
and height amplitude vs speed have a nonlinear relationship like a young person.
However, on the other hand, pathological gait subject estimated parameters does
not have nonlinear relationship. These pathological gait parameters clustered in
diﬀerent place from normal gait subjects. The result leads to our presumption
that the pathological gait subject trying to moving fast, but this eﬀort is not
eﬀective to moving speed.
4.4
Pathological Gait Detection
In this section, we apply K-NN classiﬁer (K=3), using the estimated parameters,
to perform normal/pathological gait detect, and present results from an experi-
ment involving 120 subjects (young person), and 60 subjects (elderly person).
To evaluate our estimated parameters, we apply these parameters to

Conclusion
In this article, we focus on the shape scale changing in the frontal view human
gait, we estimate scale parameters using the statistical registration and modeling
on a video data. To demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our method, we apply our
model for the frontal view human gait analysis. As a result, we also show that
our method may be used for the frontal view human gait analysis.
In next phase, we need to speed up the calculation cost of our method. Addi-
tionally, we need to implement the gait analysis system based on the proposed
method and demonstrate it.

Introduction
With the development of the industrial production, the suitability of the safety pro-
tection products, such as the safety helmet and respiratory protection product, has
become a big concern, since products with suitable dimensions can not only satisfy the
wearing comfortableness, but also meet the requirement of protecting physical health of
workers. The head data can provide bases for the designing of a series of head devices,
including the headgear, safety helmet, respiratory protection mask, etc. The method for
type and size classiﬁcation of the protecting products and the coverage proportion both
depend on the distribution of the head dimensions and the grading algorithm of the
headform samples. The study on the speciﬁcations in headform distribution can provide
basically guiding data for the dimensions and production quantities of head and face
products, esp. head and face labor-protection products.
China formally promulgated the ‘Headform Series of Chinese Adults’ (GB
2428-81) in 1981, in which there are description and classiﬁcation of headform
characteristics of males and females respectively, with 13 headforms in total [1]. In
1988, 22,300 Chinese adults were investigated and a data base of Chinese adult
human-body dimensions was established, with 7 face and head data items, which are
the head full height, head sagittal arc, bitragion-coronal arc, maximum head breadth,
maximum head length, head circumference and morphological facial length [2].

DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-40093-8_67

On the basis of this, China promulgated GB/T 2428-1998 Head and Face
Dimensions of Adults in 1998, after measuring 393 people as a small sample group (7
basic indexes), and calculated and established a sub-database of the corresponding head
and face dimensions of the sample group of Chinese adults [3]. Individual Protection
Standardization Committee established a GB/T 23461-2009 ‘Three-Dimensions of
Male Adult Headforms’ according to the three-dimensional data of 3000 male adults in
2009 [4].
GB/T 2428 takes the two-dimensional distribution of the one-dimensional feature
size of the head and face as the basis for setting the speciﬁcations of head and face, and
focuses on the application of two-dimensional graphic design. GB/T 23461-2009
‘Three-dimensions of Male Adult Headforms’ divides the three-dimensional headforms
into seven types based on the two-dimensional distribution of the head breadth and
head height indices, and takes the distribution of the zoom factor of physical volume as
the basis for the three-dimensional headform classiﬁcation, highlighting the application
of the digital design of the three-dimension modeling of the head, and being more
suitable for the current trend of making digital design of products. However, GB/T
23461-2009 takes the samples of males aged 16–36 as the main object of study,
regardless of the middle-aged and aged male group as well as the female group. The
data used in the study includes the male and female samples aged 18–65, and the head
speciﬁcations of the male and female groups are classiﬁed with the method proposed in
the GB/T 23461-2009, based on the analysis of the headform characteristics of the
sample groups.

Methods
2.1
Basic Information of the Samples
The samples used in the Study come from the database of adult human-body dimen-
sions established in 2009 by the Chinese Standardization Institute, and the database
includes data of 3000 human samples, of which the male and female each accounts for
50 % respectively and the measurement points mainly include four regions of Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai and Xi’an. The age range of the samples are from 18 to 65 years old,
of which the males have their average age of 37.7 ± 13.5 and the female 38.8 ± 13.4.
See the following (Table 1) for the details of the sample distribution.

Methods for Measurement
The Human Solution 3D Scanner was adopted for anthropometric survey. The accuracy
of the scanner is 2 mm, and the scan time is less than 10 s one person. Before the start of
the survey, the measurement team was trained in anthropometric techniques and was
checked for consistency in their survey procedures to ensure the reliability of the
anthropometric data. Head data in the survey include six items, namely head length,
head breadth, head height, head sagittal arc, bitragion-coronal arc and head circum-
ference, the deﬁnitions of which are all from GB/T 5703-2010 [5]. The dimension
values obtained were categorized according to sex and age groups and abnormity data
examination was conducted. The extreme outliers and unreasonable results were iden-
tiﬁed and eliminated carefully by using 3r test, peak value test and logical value test.

Basic Statistics and Analysis of the Data
3.1
Relationship of Sex and Head Dimensions
Independent samples are used for inspecting and analyzing the relationship between
sex and head dimensions, and the result shows that aside from head length and head
circumference, there are signiﬁcant differences (P\0:01) in the data of the other four
items, and the dimensions of head and face of the males are obviously bigger than those
of the females, so the differences between male and female should be fully considered
in the design of products.
3.2
Relevance Among the Head Data
The correlation coefﬁcient r between six head dimensions were calculated to judge the
intimacy ratio of the correlations between all the data. The equation of 0\ rj j\1
indicates that there is linear correlation to some extent between two variables. The more
rj j approaches 1, the closer the linear correlation between the two variables becomes.
The more rj j approaches 0, the weaker the linear correlation between the two variables
becomes. We can classify it into three categories: rj j\0:4 represents weaker linear
correlation; 0:4  rj j\0:7 represents signiﬁcant linear correlation; 0:7  rj j\1 repre-
sents closer linear correlation.
Calculate the related coefﬁcients among the data of the head as shown in the
following (Table 2).
• All of the linear correlations between the six measurements are not signiﬁcant
(below 0.6).
• There are comparatively closer correlations between head length and sagittal arc,
and between the head breadth and bitragion arc. Head height and the bitragion arc
also have comparatively closer correlations (0.4–0.6).
• The relativity (around 0.3) is low in the size of the three items, namely, the head
length, head breadth and head height, showing a mutual independence of the three
dimensions. In the head classiﬁcation and product design, the three dimensions
should all be considered.

Classiﬁcation of Headforms
4.1
Analysis of the Head Indices
The Study was made to the purpose of practical engineering application. In the Study,
we presume that the headform samples of each group are similar in shape, and adopt
three linear key dimensions, i.e. head length, head breadth and head height, to show the
shape information of the human head, and make classiﬁcation of the headforms with
the head breadth and head height coefﬁcients.
The head breadth-length index = (maximum head breadth/maximum head length)
 100, namely, the proportion of the maximum head breadth against the maximum
head length; the head height-length index = (maximum head height/maximum head
length)  100, namely, the proportion of the head height against the head length.
The three dimensions of head length, head breadth and head height in head indices
are considered since the three indices can reﬂect the proportational relationship among
various parts of the head and face, and can also show different types of head and face
(Table 3).

Two-Dimensional Distribution of the Head Indices and Grouping
of the Headform Samples
Tables 4 and 5 provide two-dimensional distributions of the head height-length indexes
and the head breadth-length indexes of the adult Chinese male and female. Whether or
not to produce the very model and how many related products to be produced can be
determined based on the proportions of the groups covered by the various headforms in
the table.
Note: The headform groups with coverage rates less than 1 % do not generate
standard headform.
4.3
Groups and Coverage Rates of Headforms
Tables 6 and 7 show that, for the males, the middle-upright type, round-upright type
and round-high type account for 18.80 %, 34.70 % and 29.50 % respectively, which
take a proportion of 74.3 % in the total headforms, and for the females, the
middle-upright type, round-upright type and round-high type account for 12.00 %,
31.60 % and 30.70 % respectively, which take a proportion of 74.3 % in all the
headforms. This shows that 70 % of the Chinese people possess round-upright type,
round-high type and middle-upright type, with relatively shorter and rounder

headforms indicated in the classiﬁcation based on the head length-breadth indices. For
the male, the ﬁve types of headforms, namely, the middle-upright type, round-upright
type, round-high type, middle-high type and round-extra-high type, account for 93.7 %
against all the headforms, and for the female, the ﬁve headforms, namely, the middle-
upright type, round-upright type, round-high type, super-round-high type and round-
extra-high type, account for 88.1 % of all the headforms, showing that there are ﬁve
headforms, in each group, which can represent the main part of the group.

Basic Dimensions of the Main Headforms
The headforms of the Chinese male and female are focused on the three types including
the middle-upright type, round-upright type and round-high type, so the groups of the
three types should be mainly considered in the design of head products. See the Table 8
for the basic dimensions of the heads of the three headforms.

Conclusion and Outlook
In the Study, a classiﬁcation of the headforms was made according to the head height,
head breadth and head length of the Chinese male and female, and a two-dimensional
distribution of the head height-length and head breadth-length indices was established.
Human head is of a very complicated three-dimensional shape, and the information
of size and shape in all spatial directions should be fully considered. In the perspective
of increasing the suitability of the products, the shape information among the data
points of the surface of the human body should not be ignored. In the Study, we will
further analyze the three-dimensional shape information of the head and face of human
body and explore the new method for headform classiﬁcation so as to provide bases for
the improvement of the ergonomic design and for the enhancement of the suitability of
the products.

Abstract. In the context of this study the usability of the ﬁrst blood glucose
meter that is connectable to a smartphone has been investigated by the use
through diabetic patients of different ages and with different technical experi-
ences. According to DIN ISO 2028-1 the participants had to solve usability-
tasks with the think-aloud-method. Additionally the cognitive load has been
measured for each task. As control variables we asked for age and gender as
well as technical afﬁnity and Health Literacy. A total of 12 participants (mean
age = 60.17 years) took part in this study. The results show that elderly diabetic
patients are willing and able to use modern blood glucose meters. A blood
glucose meter for elderly should store data for about three months and should be
able to export data easily to the physician by a ﬁle type like CSV. The blood
glucose testing strip should have a mark which describes the orientation and way
it should be inserted into the blood glucose meter. The testing strip should also
be illuminated to improve blood glucose measurements during nighttime.

Introduction
The quantity of diabetic patients in Germany is increasing exponentially. The Inter-
national Diabetes Foundation states that 7.6 million people had diabetes in Germany
[1]. More than half of those affected are older than 65 years, and the risk to come down
with diabetes increases with age [2, 3]. In the context of a therapy, an autonomous
control of the blood sugar level through the patient is often necessary. For this purpose
so-called glucometers are used. In the course of the increasing digitalization, glu-
cometers have been extended by many functions so that modern devices do not only
measure the blood sugar level, but, in combination with a mobile terminal, also enable
to process and analyze the recorded data and give feedback to the user. Various studies
showed that those systems increase treatment adherence and patient satisfaction if they
are accepted by the user [4, 5]. Hence the usability is especially important because a

device that is not ﬁt for this purpose may lead to an incorrect measurement and a
decreasing therapy adherence [6].
This explorative study examined the usability of a glucometer connected to a
smartphone with elderly patients. For this purpose, different key aspects of performance
of a modern glucometer were considered. Additionally the usability has been explored
by simulated blood sugar measurements. Thus, concrete design guidelines and rec-
ommendations for the design of modern glucometers could be derived.

Method
In the context of this study the ﬁrst blood glucose meter which is connectable to a
smartphone iBG-Star has been investigated according to DIN ISO 20282-1. For this
investigation different usability tasks were deﬁned which the participant had to process
independently (Table 1).
During the processing, participants were observed using the think-aloud-method
[7]. Subsequent to each task the subjective mental load was evaluated using the Rating
Scale of Mental Effort [8]. This method is based on a visual and linguistically encoded
scale of 150 Points (Fig. 1). Subjects rated their individual mental effort.
Since the glucometer is connectable to different types of mobile terminals the
usability tasks were set twice. During the ﬁrst run participants used the glucometer in
combination with an iPad 2, and during the second one with an iPhone 4S. Therewith
should be examined if the use of a smartphone or a tablet and related advantages and
disadvantages do have an impact on usability. Compared to the presentation on a
smartphone or the glucometer-display itself the larger display area of a tablet could be
advantageous for elderly people, whereas the size of the mobile terminals could have a
negative impact. A summarizing judgement of the usability in arithmetical form has
been conducted employing the Post Study Usability Questionnaire [9].
Besides the usability tasks, a semi-structured interview was conducted which was
supposed to examine factors of acceptance of a modern diabetes management system.
We placed special focus on aspects of data processing and data release. Furthermore

participants were asked about their acceptance of functions that guide them and,
beyond that, encourage them to lead a healthy life (Table 2).
As control variables age, gender and technical afﬁnity were recorded. The latter one
was estimated by employing a questionnaire used in previous research [10]. Using
another questionnaire, the previous therapy was evaluated. For this purpose participants

were asked to state which health-related data they record in the context of their therapy
and where they store it. In order to comprehensively document the participants’
health-related knowledge we used the Health Literacy Questionnaire [11]. This ques-
tionnaire examines in how far the participant knows important facts about the disease,
its therapy and compliant behavior.
After an approval of the ethics committee of the faculty of medicine of the RWTH
University (EK028/15) participants were recruited via self-help groups and postings in
the Aachen area.
2.1
Participants
Overall N = 12 participants (male = 4; female = 8) participated in this study (see
Table 3). The average participant age is 60.17 (SD = 15.04). All participants stated that
they are diabetics for more than ten years, whereby ﬁve participants suffer from type I
diabetes, six from type II diabetes and one participant from type 3c diabetes. Three out
of 12 participants stated that they suffer from physical constraint as a consequence of
diabetes. On average the participants perform 3.58 blood sugar measurements a day,
whereby the minimum in this sample is two measurements and the maximum seven
measurements a day. With regard to the therapy compliance, the amount of daily blood
sugar measurements of all participants corresponded with the speciﬁcations of the
treating physician. Regarding the individual therapy, the semi-structured interview
revealed that all participants hand over their therapy related health data to their doctor

personally. Seven out of ten documented their data paper-based. Only three participants
stated that they enter their values in digital form and that they are stored in the
glucometer itself.

Experimental Apparatus
The blood glucose meter “iBG-Star’’ produced by AgaMatrix Inc., 7C Raymond
Avenue, Salem, NH 03079, USA which is distributed in Germany by Sanoﬁ-Aventis
Deutschland GmbH, Industriepark Hoechst, K703 Brüningstr. 50, 65926 Frankfurt am
Main has been investigated in the context of this study. Besides that, an iPhone 4S
(16 GB) and an iPad 2 (32 GB) by Apple Inc., 1 Inﬁnite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014
USA were used (Fig. 2).
The products tested were provided by mySugr GmbH, Schottenfeldgasse 69/3.1,
1070 Wien, Austria. The necessary Blood Testing Strips were provided by
Sanoﬁ-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Industriepark Höchst K703, 65926 Frankfurt,
Germany.

Procedure
After the examiners welcomed the participants, an informal interview was conducted in
order to collect information about their demographics and the individual diabetes
therapy. After that, participants independently completed the questionnaires on tech-
nical afﬁnity and Health Literacy. This was followed by the independent performance
of usability tasks through the participants themselves. For this purpose, participants
were introduced to the concept of the Rating Scale of Mental Effort by practicing the
visual and linguistically encoded scale employing ﬁve everyday examples. Following
this, participants were asked to unpack the product using the think-aloud-method.

Afterwards, a simulated blood sugar measurement was conducted using the glucometer
in combination with an iPad. For direct comparison a second simulated measurement
was conducted in which the glucometer was connected to an iPhone. Subsequent to
these tasks, participants were asked to ﬁll in the Post Study System Questionnaire
(PSSUQ) with reference to both measurements. Thus a universal evaluation of the
glucometer in full operational spectrum could be ensured. This was followed by an
informal interview concerning the advantages and disadvantages of each measurement
in relation to the glucometer used by the participants in everyday life. Each appoint-
ment was concluded with a semi-structured interview which examined acceptance
factors of modern diabetes management systems. As compensation for their effort
participants received 20 euros.

Results
The examination of technical afﬁnity showed that participants were rather hostile to
technology since the average value across all participants is 2.672 (SD = 0.406) on a
4-Likert-scale (1 = ‘I fully agree’ to 4 = ‘I completely disagree’). According to the
Post Study System Usability Questionnaire the investigated glucometer was averagely
evaluated with a value of 2.06 (SD = 1.02) on a 7-Likert-scale (1 = ‘I fully agree’ to
7 = ‘I
completely
disagree’)

Furthermore participants stated that the glucometer can be used signiﬁcantly better
combined with the smartphone. Assumed advantages of the tablet as a result of the
larger display were eliminated by disadvantages of the handling. Participants reported
that the sheer size of the glucometer makes it more attractive due to the fact that it can
be easily carried along in everyday life. Equally, half of the participants were con-
vinced by the modern design of the glucometer as well as the evaluation possibilities
with the aid of the app. On the other hand they considered the amount of product
components that are necessary for a blood sugar measurement such as monitoring
strips, lancet and charger as a disadvantage. Furthermore they criticized that the glu-
cometer is solely compatible with apple products. They would like to have a universal
port which allows applicability with mobile devices from different manufacturers.

Discussion
This paper presented a usability evaluation of the ﬁrst blood glucose meter which is
connectable to a smartphone. Elderly diabetic patients, who participated in this study,
stated that they would recommend this modern glucometer. The space-saving and
modern design of the evaluated glucometer was judged as beneﬁcial and attractive.
According to the Post Study System Usability Questionnaire the blood glucose
meter has a good usability as the value is around 2 points on the 7-Likert-scale. The
inspection of the requested RSME-values conﬁrms this usability evaluation. The
requested values vary between 0 points and 50 points for individual participants on a
150-point scale (Fig. 1). The maximum value which was gathered of 50 points cor-
responds to a mental load between ‘little effort’ and ‘relatively large effort’. The highest
average mental effort was measured when participants inserted blood glucose testing
strips into the glucometer for the ﬁrst-time in combination with a tablet. The partici-
pants stated that it was difﬁcult to perceive in which orientation and at which position
the testing strip has to be inserted. In addition it was exhausting to insert the small
testing strip into the likewise small opening of the device.
Qualitative interviews showed that the used blood glucose meter lacked an illu-
mination of the testing strip. This would facilitate the nightly measurement in the
bedroom and thereby other persons present in the room would not be wakened by
someone switching on the lights. Participants clearly criticized that the device cannot
be used universally with every type of smartphone. However, the participants appre-
ciated the automatic storing and the possibilities of long-term analysis of the tested
blood sugar level. Furthermore participants named these functions as basic requirement
for the use of such a modern blood glucose meter. These ﬁndings correspond to the
results of Valdez who examined this question by using a ﬁctional blood glucose meter
[12]. Moreover, they stated that the corresponding app should visualize a period of at
least three months in order to give a useful overview of the personal health state. In
reply to the question with whom they would like to share their health-related data
everyone stated that it should be available to their doctor immediately after the mea-
surement. By contrast they do not want it to be sent to their health insurance or any
other external group in health care. Besides the blood sugar value, further data, for
example physical activity behavior or personal nutrition, should be recorded and stored.

P. Rasche et al.

The only restriction that was named in this regard is that there should be the possibility
of correcting data because a glucometer is a device that often is not used by only one
person. This leads to the risk that the values of another person could be assigned to the
patients personal health ﬁle.
Asked about their actual diabetes therapy, participants reported that their physicians
in charge do often not have the appropriate system available in order to transfer the data
from their blood glucose meter digitally. Furthermore, they claimed that their glu-
cometer is not designed to transfer data in an manner other than transcribed paper form.
Participants agreed that this effort should be reduced through the use of a modern
glucometer and that the automatic data backup would be a fundamental requirement if
they would think about buying a modern glucometer connectable to a smartphone.
In conclusion, it can be noted that digitalization of a glucometer produces clear
beneﬁts for patients and doctors and that these advantages are also advocated for by
elderly diabetic patients with low technical afﬁnity. On the other hand, a lot of work is
necessary to enhance interoperability among blood glucose meters and diabetic man-
agement systems as well as between patients’ and physicians’ systems.

Abstract. Incident reporting enables clinicians to examine historical patient
safety events and to target diﬀerent levels of analysis toward actionable knowl‐
edge. The cross-cultural adaptation of reporting instruments promotes the inter‐
national communication on medical errors and patient safety culture.  This study
initializes a translation and adaptation of the Common Formats (in US) to Chinese
and a localized reporting on perinatal incidents in a Chinese hospital. The results
demonstrate the validity of the cross-cultural translation and diversity in a typical
perinatal incident reported by Chinese clinicians. These ﬁndings suggest (1) a
comprehensive data report format is critical in the incident reporting; (2) an
imperative need of cross-cultural study on incident reporting; (3) future direction
of incident reporting and patient safety culture.

Introduction
Following the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report ‘To Err Is Human’, patient safety
reports record and communicate information relevant to patient safety events and quality
problems [1]. To date, patient safety reporting has gained increasing attention because
it leads to learning from the causation of previous incidents and preventing potential
harms [2, 3]. It has been documented that collecting, analyzing, and communicating
patient safety information play important roles in reporting [4–6]. Challenges to these
aspects of reporting are recognized as (1) the diﬃculty of collecting data in high quality
[5]; (2) the lack of eﬀective analytics of generating actionable knowledge [4]. Most
importantly, data collection is one of the cornerstones of the reporting since it enables
analytics at diﬀerent levels [7]. A recent study indicated that a comprehensive deﬁnition
and classiﬁcation of reports can facilitate information integration and the disclosure of
hidden and recurring harms that point to system vulnerabilities [8, 9].

In 2009, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in the US devel‐
oped standardized deﬁnitions and reporting formats for patient safety events, i.e.
Common Formats. The Common Formats receive and aggregate patient safety related
information ranging from general concerns to frequently occurred and clinically signif‐
icant events [10]. In practice, the use of the Common Formats demonstrates the capacity
of enhancing information classiﬁcation, error identiﬁcation, and harm scaling [11–13].
When it comes to the discussion of patient safety in China, there are concerns about
patient safety reporting in a wide spectrum of patient safety events [14, 15], in which
cultural competence and health information technology (i.e., data exchange and system
interoperability) have been recognized recently [14, 16, 17]. This paper aims to perform
a ﬁeld trial of utilizing the Common Formats in a perinatal safety reporting system in a
Chinese Hospital. The challenges of reporting perinatal incidents reside in the quality
of reported data and substantial analytical bias [18–23]. The detailed tasks include
(1) translating relevant Common Formats into Chinese; (2) employing cross-cultural
adaptation; (3) utilizing translated forms to report patient safety events in the Chinese
hospital; (4) performing quantitative and qualitative analysis from the perspective of
health informatics.

Background
2.1
Incident Reporting
Incident reporting is recognized as one important factor to improve to the safety culture
[24]. The goal of incident reporting in a hospital is to prevent recurrence of incidents by
collecting useful clinical information from documented incidents. Therefore, a reporting
system as such should include a comprehensive data entry design for categorizing inci‐
dents and more importantly, the clinical information underlying the description of the
incident [25]. In many countries, the structure of such categorization varies between
hospitals [5, 26, 27]. The inconsistency in language has become another barrier that
aﬀects the utility of reporting [2, 28]. These problems jointly hamper the incident
reporting from improvement.
In the US, incident reporting has drawn ascending attention as a nationwide patient
safety program [29, 30]. Although incident reporting has been broadly implemented in
US hospitals, the ever-existing question is how the reporting can advance safety eﬀorts
eﬀectively [31, 32]. To maximize the safety eﬀorts through reporting, US hospitals may
work with AHRQ funded patient safety organizations (PSO), which provide expertise
in incident reporting, to aggregate patient safety events through the existing reporting
systems. In addition, the Common Formats were developed to facilitate the aggregation
of patient safety information.
2.2
Perinatal Safety
Improving perinatal safety is a complex undertaking that involves multidisciplinary team
care and various components of such a care. An initiative of perinatal safety is to identify
problems and generate actionable knowledge to reduce future harm [33]. The use of clinical
696
W. Shan et al.

information requires effective data communication, error analysis, and clinical decision
support where information technology plays an important role [34].
The Common Formats contribute to the data collection, organization, and commu‐
nication in an early stage of perinatal incident reporting. In the Common Formats, a
perinatal incident form is designed for event-speciﬁc information that is highly impor‐
tant in perinatal incidents. Information that is required, but not speciﬁc for perinatal
incidents is collected through the generic formats.
2.3
Cross-Cultural Adaptation in Healthcare
The globalization of healthcare indicates a great need for cross-cultural research [35].
The clinicians and researchers need valid and reliable instruments in a diverse language
and culture. Accordingly, various methodologies were established for translating,
adapting, and validating healthcare instruments in the cross-cultural context. The current
version of the Common Formats is designed for the US hospitals and healthcare institutes
use but not for such healthcare settings abroad the US.

Design and Implementation
3.1
Cross-Cultural Translation and Adaptation of the Common Formats
Seven independent health care professionals were involved in the cross-cultural trans‐
lation and adaptation of the Common Formats. The task includes translation, back-
translation, and reconciliation as listed as follows [36–38]. (1) Five perinatal related
forms were translated to Chinese, which comprise of healthcare event reporting form
(HERF), patient information form (PIF), summary of initial report (SIR), Perinatal
Form, and Perinatal Event Description. Translators A and B performed the translation.
Items in the original Common Formats that do not ﬁt in Chinese settings were modiﬁed
or removed. (2) To maximize the equivalence of meaning between the source and target
text, translators C and D performed the back-translation that translates the Chinese
A Cross-Cultural Adaptation in Reporting Perinatal Safety Events
697

translation back to English. (3) In the reconciliation, translators E, F, and G compared
the original text with the back-translated text for issues such as confusion, ambiguities,
and errors. A reconciliation report with notes of these issues and the recommended edits
and adjustments was sent to the panel of seven translators (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) for
discussion. A consolidated version of Chinese translation is formed once all issues are
addressed. See Table 1 for qualiﬁcations of the seven translators.

An adverse event of obstetrics
A female, 32 y/o, gave birth to her ﬁrst fetus after cesarean section 5 years ago. She came to our
hospital waiting for her second baby delivery on Sep, 18th, 2014.
She was diagnosed as Full-term pregnancy (38 + 4 weeks), second fetus, ROA. She had no
vaginal bleeding, no abdominal pain, no premature rupture of fetal membranes. Because of
her scarred uterus, she applied for her second caesarean. We performed uterine lower
segmental cesarean to her on 19th, September 2014. The operation process was successful,
the new baby’s weight is 3800 g and the APGAR score is 9–10–10. But we found her new
baby’s right elbow eversion and felt bone friction sensation. We doubted neonate bone frac‐
ture, so an orthopedist came and suggested an X-ray examination. Later the X-ray conﬁrmed
the diagnosis of neonate right humeral fracture. Quickly the new baby was applied reduction
and external ﬁxation of fracture. Baby’s other body indexes were good except the fracture.
On the 11th day after neonate birth, the second X-ray showed favorable restoration and new
poroma.
The mom-baby left our hospital on the same day.
3.2
Reporting and Data Collection
The Perinatal Form and Perinatal Event Description were utilized to report a perinatal
incident de-identiﬁed from a Chinese hospital and written in Chinese (see Table 2).
Twenty-one graduate students in the School of Nursing participated in the reporting.
Table 3 shows the demographics of the participants.
The participants were instructed prior to the reporting, where the Perinatal Event
Description Form was utilized for the deﬁnitions of concept/terminology. Each partic‐
ipant was asked to provide general information regarding education, degree, specialty,
and clinical training prior to the reporting. The reporting was administered utilizing
paper-based materials. We previewed the returned forms (response rate: 100 %) and
found all responses were complete and adequate.

The percentage is rounded to tenths.
Figure 1 shows a part of items with diverse responses. In Item 5, four participants
accounted that only the neonate was aﬀected by the event, while the rest accounted both
of mother and neonate. In Item 6, 16 participants identiﬁed the outcomes to the mother
as ‘injury to body part or organ’, whereas the rest speciﬁed ‘psychological inﬂuence’.
In Item 11, 19 participants chose ‘Birth trauma/injury as listed under ICD-9-CM 767 or
ICD-10-CM P10-P15’, whereas one chose ‘Five-min Apgar < 7 and birth‐
weight > 2500 g’ and the other one chose both. In Item 16, 15 participants identiﬁed an
induced labor, while ﬁve other participants identiﬁed an augmented labor, and one
speciﬁed ‘unknown’. In Item 19, 14 participants identiﬁed there was no instrumentation
used to assist vaginal delivery, whereas the rest identiﬁed ‘unknown’.

Discussion and Future Work
Utilizing the Common Formats in a cross-cultural study shows that some items may not
be completely adapted to the reporting forms in the local Chinese hospital, even though
the rigorous translation and veriﬁcation process were in place. For example, in the
Common Formats, a perinatal period extends from the 20th week of gestation through
A Cross-Cultural Adaptation in Reporting Perinatal Safety Events
699

four weeks (28 days) postpartum, whereas Chinese healthcare systems use the 28th week
of gestation through seven days postpartum. WHO deﬁnes a perinatal period of the 22th
week of gestation through seven-day postpartum.
The diversity shown in the reports may partially depend on the understanding of the
sample case and the interoperability of the report form. (1) The various understandings
may be due to specialties and clinical experiences. For instance, in item six, ‘Which
adverse outcomes did the mother sustain?’, ﬁve out of 21 participants suggested that the
mother was psychologically aﬀected by the adverse event. Three of them are specialized
in nursing psychology, one is in nursing ethics, and the other one is nursing in psychiatry.
As indicated in the results, reporters who received training in nursing psychology or
psychiatry tend to conclude psychological inﬂuences from the report. Regulations may
be developed in reporting formats to reduce such ambiguities. The responses from the
other participants reﬂect their clinical specialty and previous training to a certain extent.

It remains unclear if the Common Formats allow reporters to include reasonable assump‐
tions based on their clinical expertise. (2) The results from item 5 indicate a subject
judgment is involved in the reporting. There were four participants out of 21 did not
check that ‘mother was aﬀected by the event’. Two participants amongst the four argued
there was no mention of the mother in the description, whereas the other two believed
that compared to the fetal fracture mother was barely aﬀected by the event. (3) The
diverse responses to item 11 and 19 indicate a discrepant understanding of the incident
due to the incompleteness of information from the report and the oversimpliﬁed items
in the perinatal form.
Based on our ﬁndings, we suggest improving the perinatal safety in two aspects.
First, structured data entry is recommended in the collection of the data. A number of
the discrepant responses are due to the loss and ambiguity of the information. Structured
data entry may reduce such vulnerability. This suggestion is in line with the advantages
of the Common Formats as they provide a framework for structured data entry for patient
safety events. Second, further studies should expand to the translation of all the other
Common Formats, which would help a quick adaptation in using a reporting standard
of patient safety events. Our ﬁndings in perinatal reporting have disclosed a pressing
need of cross-cultural adaptation of perinatal incident reporting in Chinese hospitals.
When it comes to the discussion of patient safety in China, there are concerns of incident
reporting in a wide spectrum of medical adverse events [14, 15].

Abstract. Deaf people is a special group whose biggest social barrier is that it is
difﬁcult for them to communicate with hearing people. Puji Public Service Net
Platform has been devoted into the popularization of the sign language culture,
with the convergence of all kinds of stakeholders such as volunteers, public
service organizations, deaf groups and government administration department.
Cooperated with Puji Public Service Net Platform, our designing team has
established an ideal multiple-contact service mode through the factual and desktop
research, the service designing tools such as personas and case studies etc.
The designing of “The Taste of Sign Language” APP is devoted into pro-
moting equal communication through video communication of learning sign
language between the hearing people and the deaf. Through recording the life
little by little, sharing thoughts and online social scenes of the information, the

Introduction
Deaf People is the disabled people with the hearing loss cause of congenital defect or
human factors, hereinafter referred to as the deaf. According to the sixth National
Census Data of 2010, there are around 20.75 million deaf people, among whom there are
8675 deaf people in Wuxi City including 4831 deaf males. According to the national
standard, there are four grades (Grade I is the most serious) for the hearing of deaf
people. Because of the congenital defect or human factors, this group cannot hear sound

from the outside, so their ‘talking’ style and habit is different from that of hearing
people. On one hand, the deaf feel inferior caused by hearing barrier and gradually
reduce the communication with the outside; on the other hand, the hearing people are
lack of the chances of taking care of the deaf cause of not knowing how to communicate
with the deaf. Just because of the existence of the incomprehension and the commu-
nication barrier, an invisible “wall” form between the deaf and the hearing people.
Puji Public Service Net Platform has been devoted into the popularization of the sign
language culture, with the convergence of all kinds of stakeholders such as volunteers,
public service organizations, deaf groups and government administration departments.
This organization consider the deaf as a special group, the biggest social barrier is that it
is difﬁcult for them to communicate with the hearing people. Such barrier makes their
living and mental space extremely narrow and leaves the warmhearted people away
from their world. Our designing team of this subject had the cooperation with Puji
Public Service Net Platform, establishing the ideal multiple-contact service mode
through the factual and desk research, the service designing tools such as personas and
case studies etc. “The Taste of Sign Language” APP is devoted into promoting the equal
communication through the video communication of learning sign language between
the hearing people and the deaf. Through recording the life little by little, sharing the
thoughts, the online social scenes of the information times, the short video application
motifs the ‘performance’ desire of the users, builds the empathy, gradually improves the
user stickiness and helps the user to form habit.
The development and application of the service designing has provided new train of
thought and solutions for public welfare undertakings [1]. The development and
application of the service designing has provided methodology and solutions for public
welfare undertakings. The service design of the public service projects is not the same as
the commercial project, preferring the social value to the economic maximization. With
the social responsibility, the designers should reexamine the designing, pay more
attention to the design for the social public beneﬁt, which demands the designers to
integrate all kinds of social resources creatively through social innovations [2]. One of
the main characteristics of social innovation is satisfying the unsatisﬁed demand of the
oppositely vulnerable group [3]. It is not only the object requirement for the designers in
modern society through satisfying the demand of the vulnerable group and improving
their communications with other members of society, but also the reﬂection of the
designers’ intrinsic properties as social agent [4]. The designers of ‘Pushing Wall’
Interesting Sign Language APP value keeping the interest of the deaf and the hearing
people for the mutual learning the software tools, to push over the invisible wall between
the deaf and the hearing people and then help the deaf return the society (Fig. 1).

Concepts and Discussions
Determining how to design the effective service procedure for the social problems
creatively, there is one basic way, ﬁnding the effective cases through the investigation,
then building a replicable solution on this base [5]. After the preliminary case analysis
and user survey, the mutual learning style through short video on Mobile APP. What-

and Instagram abroad, the short video sharing are triggering the social circles quietly.
The novelty of the social contact motivates the users’ power to share for the ﬁrst time.
With the functional and social driving force, the short video sharing also has the spirit
demand of communication and feelings. The above two elements makes the necessity
of its existence.
2.1
Overall Process
Service design for social innovation follows the standard procedure of service design
and it is carried on iteratively throughout four steps of investigation, designing,
feedback and execution [6]. Through the extensive investigation, the design team and
the stakeholders built up empathy and trust relationship mutually, brought in the ser-
vice strategy of the interaction among multi-dimensional different-type users in the
following steps, designers integrated a series of online service function of interaction
education, information sharing and weak-tie social contact etc. The team has produced
several lo-ﬁservice designing modes such as story board, customer journey and blue
print etc., making the service procedure and scenes visible to the stakeholders for better
understanding. At the same time, the team designed the hi-ﬁservice modes including
the sign language education APP and series of short video application, then optimized
the user experience of each touchpoint to form an integrated service system through the
short video and application design (Fig. 2).

Questionnaire and Data Processing of Empirical Research
For this research, we handed out the questionnaires to the deaf and the hearing people
and ﬁnally received 209 hearing people questionnaires and 296 deaf questionnaires. If
the answers of a questionnaire were nearly the same or not written seriously, the
questionnaire was regarded as a waste questionnaire. There were 3 waste question-
naires of hearing people, meaning the waste questionnaire ratio was 1.4 %, while 44
waste questionnaires of deaf people, meaning the waste questionnaire ratio was
14.8 %. The work was done through SPSS17.0 software package and Excel, such as
logging the questionnaire data, statistics, ﬁling, analysis, correlation analysis and ele-
ment analysis according to the data base.
Research Result I of the Empirical Research: Communication Experience Anal-
ysis of the Deaf-hearing Communication. From Fig. 3 we could see: the evaluation
index of the hearing people testee is CSI (1.67–3.72)toward the deaf-hearing com-
munication experience. The highest score of the hearing people testee is the cooper-
ation attitude, CSI (3.72), but the sign language skill of them is the lowest (1.67). For
the deaf testee, the evaluation index is CSI (3.26–3.85) toward the deaf-hearing
communication experience, among all of the aspects, the lowest CSI is the sign lan-
guage skill of the hearing people: 3.26, the highest CSI is their cooperation attitude:
CSI (3.85). For the familiarity to the deaf people is in the middle as (3.53). Through the
comparison of the two curves of the hearing people and the deaf, we could see the CSI
index of the hearing people testee is lower than that of the deaf on every aspect, so
generally speaking, the total experience of the hearing people is worse than that of the
deaf on deaf-hearing communication. So we can conclude that the deaf and the hearing
people are both enthusiastic about the communication cooperation, but can not com-
municate successfully with the sign language skill limit, and the same time, the low
familiarity to the deaf people makes the deaf-hearing communication a sea of troubles,
and leads to the big difference of the communication experience.
Result II of the Empirical Research: Relative Experience Analysis of the
Deaf-hearing Communication. From Fig. 4 we could see the cooperation attitude
index curve of all age groups is CSI (3.62–3.93), apparently higher than the curve of
familiarity and the curve of the sign language expression. The attitude curve reaches the

people (Color ﬁgure online)

707

peak during the testee aged 36-45: CSI 3.93. The score of the testee aged above 45 is
the lowest, only (3.62).For the familiarity to the deaf, the score difference is CSI (2.42–
3.37), oppositely big among the age groups. For the sign language curve, the testee
score of all age groups is generally lower than that of the other curves, CSI (2.18–2.76).
We could see the following information through the score of the testee of all age groups
for the familiarity to the deaf, cooperation attitude and the sign language expression:
The testee experience difference is the lowest above age 45, the three index difference
is 0.86.
We could see according to the CSI curve, the score of the testee with and under the
education background of high school/secondary technical school is generally higher
than that of the other testee with other education backgrounds, while the score of the
testee with and above the master degree is lower than that of the other testee with other
education backgrounds, which indicates the education level is inversely proportional to
the evaluation of the communication experience between the deaf and the hearing
people, Through analyzing the users’ cooperation attitude CSI (3.37–3.89). From the
curve of the familiarity to the deaf, we could see the CSI of the testee with different
education backgrounds is 2.25–3.65. For the sign language expression curve, the score
of the testee with different education backgrounds is 1.56–3.20, It is means the sign
language expression experience is at variance with the psychology of the user with high
education level (Fig. 5).

Result II of the Empirical Research: Experience Analysis of the Video Application
of the Deaf-hearing Group. From Fig. 6 we could see: On the CSI curve, the deaf is
most familiar with Meipai with SCI index 2.8 * 3.1, apparently higher than the
application of the application of the other videos. The next is Miaopai, SCI index is
above 2.2. For the familiarity to Weishi, there is big difference between the deaf and the
hearing people, the deaf more familiar than the hearing people by 0.7. We could ﬁgure
it out from the curve, except Weishi, both the deaf and the hearing people are similar to
each other on the familiarity to the other videos. And the deaf much more prefer
Weishi.
Result IV of the Empirical Research: Relative Experience Analysis about the
Video Application by the Deaf and the Hearing People. From Fig. 6 we could see:
On the CSI curve, the deaf and the hearing people at all age groups are the most
familiar with Meipai, SCI index being 2.5 * 3.1, apparently higher than the appli-
cation of the other kinds of videos. The next is Miaopai, SCI index of all age groups
beyond 2.0. Usually the school students under the age 25 are not so familiar with
Weishi video software, apparently different from the other age groups. From the curve
chart we could see, except Weishi Video, the SCI of all age groups are generally
similar, which means the people of all age groups have the similar familiarity to the
videos. In addition, young people more prefer Meipai, iCastshow and Miaopai. Except
Meipai, known to all, the middle-aged people over 45 prefer the Weishi video appli-
cation (Fig. 7).
We could see: On the CSI curve, except administrative staff, the people of all
professions is much more familiar with Meipai than the application of the other videos
with SCI index kept 2.5 * 3.8, among whom the main application group of Meipai is
human resource, teschenitic, full-time student and sales personnel, knowing more about
Meipai. Comparatively speaking, except Meipai, the people of all professions are
oppositely familiar with Weishi with the SCI index 2.4 * 2.6, among whom the full
time student, teacher and professionals know little of Weishi, with the professional
index at the lowest (1.35). The familiarity to Papaqi of the people of all professions is
below 2.0, among whom the support staff knows the least with the lowest index (1.02),
which means most of the people are not familiar with this software and rarely use it.

Result V of the Empirical Research: Communication Scene Experience Analysis
of the Deaf and the Hearing People. During the investigation of the scene contact
degree analysis, the testee need choose three scenes and rank by the order. Later during
the data logging and analysis, the unchosen items is 0, and the three chosen items gets
the score of 3, 2 and 1, then the average score is analyzed.
From Fig. 9 we could see: During the investigation of the scene contact degree
analysis, the highest contact degree is the shopping mall both to the deaf and to the
hearing, CSI (1.59) and CSI (1.90). Apart from this, the lowest one is the hospital, CSI
(0.73) and CSI (0.72). The above information indicates that there are higher contact
degrees in the daily scenes such as shopping mall, hospital and railway station etc.,
where there are more sign language happening. The margin scenes of schools tend to
be the scenes with rare sign language. On the whole, the contact degree from the
hearing people to the deaf is lower than that from the deaf to the hearing people, which
reﬂects the low attention from the hearing people to the deaf and the necessity of the
casual contact of the deaf and the hearing people.
2.3
The Iterative Process of the Service Designing
The service designing is one way of tackling the complexed problems on the whole [6],
whose iterative designing procedure has three to seven steps with the multiple frames,
and basically it is four steps of mining, locating, development and communication [7].
The iterative process of the four steps follows the ‘double diamond’ design process
model mainly [8]. After the preliminary investigation, the background and demand of
the users are shown, and there are the basically reliable information for the service
location, then it’s the time for the designers to develop the service procedure and
transmit the designing conception to the other stakeholders.
During the process of the service locating, the designers chose some easy and
interesting sign language games to be the application carrier after testing several sign
language education modes. During the later cooperative development process, the staff
of Puji Public Service and other users were invited to attend the service experience with
their feedback. According to the feedback, the design ﬂow would return to the lo-ﬁ
model or case investigation step, which means the service designing development was
carried on iteratively.

2.4
Lo-Fi Service Mode
During the process of the service design development, the lo-ﬁmode and hi-ﬁmode are
the frequently used design tools [9].
Lo-ﬁmode is a kind of fast and low-cost establishing and testing method of service
design [10], which has the pretty good effect when testing the user demand [11]. Based
on the investigation result, the lo-ﬁprototype was developed under the cooperative
design of the designing team and the stakeholders. Generally for the lo-ﬁprototyping, it
includes tools as customer journey and personas etc. Because the net activity on the
mobile net is mobile and based on the environment [12], so the renewal of the personal
activity scene and the net information is more inseparable, then we chose the user trip
drawing showing the experience process and effect as the main lo-ﬁmode, In the
process of making the user experience, we determine the pain points and contact points
according to the corresponding behavior generated by users at different stages, and
obtain the corresponding design points. Sign language teaching APP and short video
applications promote the equality of exchange between the deaf people and hearing
people. Game experience also inspired the users to complete the goals of the deter-
mination, tapped the user’s basic desires and needs. Finally, we will establish an
effective information sharing platform based on these data (Fig. 8).
At the same time, we are considered the different stakeholders and then analyze
their attitude and vision according to the personas. Based on the views of existing
situation of communication between the deaf people and the hearing people from the
personas, namely, the deaf people, the hearing people and stakeholders, the analysis of
user targets and their own smartphones consumption. We can draw the conclusion that
the inability of expression of sign language has become the main barrier for commu-
nication. While the boring learning method of sign language and the lack of
scenario-based learning of sign language constitute the main reason. Made the abstract
service ﬂow and scenes visible, possible for the people to understand the designing
proposals intuitively, such as all kinds of stakeholders of volunteers, public service
organizations, the deaf groups and the government departments (Fig. 9).

2.5
Hi-Fi Service Mode
After the test of lo-ﬁmode on the service feasibility, design team needed to analyze the
detail of the user experience on each link and also make the simulation test for service
ﬂow, which need to build hi-ﬁmode. Persona is a typical hi-ﬁservice design tool,
during which the designers and other participators play the roles of the service ﬂow
themselves, supposing the service existing, to experience the service result and the
interactive relationship etc. [13]. More importantly, perona can help the designers to
simulate and understand the different responses from different users under the same
background [14]. The design team recorded some role play videos of designers
themselves, which made the designers to have the personal experiences of the sign
language educations, and the video itself displayed functions in the sign language App
as one part of the designing materials.
Under the guidance of the theory, we analyze the data and extract the main
demands then we make the interaction draft of “The taste of sign language”. The taste
of sign language is aimed to increase the communication between the deaf people and
the hearing people. The main features include sign video teaching based on scenario

classiﬁcation, the entrance from the deaf world and the hearing one and the community
for the purpose of interaction with the form of activities. On the content of the short
videos they are elected with rating form. And it uses the game experience to enhance
the interaction on the interactive mode. Apart from those, Positive and optimistic visual
experience is expected to be available to users on the vision (Fig. 10).

Conclusion
After the analysis of all of the pain points and opportunity points, we found that the
deaf and dumb circles are enclosed although they have the parties on certain days and
there are the joint discussion about the news sign language explanation. Mainly the
hobbies of the deaf are photography, painting, tour, dancing and playing cards. The
sign language only exists in the special education school with the dialects. The national
standard is not complete with the low acceptability, even many deaf people can not
understand the national standard yet. There were some organizations online and ofﬂine
of learning sign language for the hearing people with the low enthusiasm, stickiness
and necessity. The activities of the Disabled Association are not for the deaf and dumb
on purpose. The Deaf and Dumb Association is generally undertaken by the retiree,
mainly making the retirement registration for the deaf and dumb. Up to now, there
haven’t been the real statistics of their profession, income and education levels. The
speciﬁc data is counted in the community of the deaf and there haven’t been the perfect
statistics system (Fig. 11).

On the base of the sign language video resources, we make use of the video carrier
(e.g. Meipai, iCastshow) to attract the hearing people to record their sign language. The
user can get bonus after uploading the video, then he can share with others about his
self-presentation as a partial social contact. The Taste of Sign Language (TTOSL) APP
will post the contact information of the video uploaders (on their own will), correct the
sign language in common sector with demonstration, then thumb-ups with motivation
mechanism introduced. The user can build his own charity ﬁle through the uploading
and sharing.
For the designing of The Taste of Sign Language, all the stakeholders were getting
involved in the process of the beginning, investigation, lo-ﬁ, hi-ﬁand the designing
decision. The designing result makes the hearing people and the deaf to learn the sign
language mutually and really with the short video, promoting the equal communica-
tion. Through recording the life little by little, sharing the thoughts, the online social
scenes of the information times, the short video application motifs the ‘performance’
desire of the users, builds the empathy, gradually improves the user stickiness and
helps the user to form the habit. The development and application of the service
designing has provided new train of thought and solutions for public welfare
undertakings.

Abstract. This paper discusses the present situation and the development in the
ﬁeld of the medical service in China. To make the wards information service as
the consisting of diﬀerent contact points of nursing service, it is helpful to opti‐
mize the complexity questions of the hospitalization experience. From the
perspective of information service, it deeply analyses the business and the nursing
information of the ward nurses station from service process and the contact point
of information service. We also have took a research in Wuxi Fourth People’s
Hospital to get In-depth knowledge of the question and speciﬁc needs when
hospitalized patients and nurses on the ward medical service which is researched
through the user interviews of hospitalized patients, behavior observation, the
service blueprint and some other methods. Then have summed up ﬁve categories
such as service of handing of patients’ admission and discharge, cost query, reha‐
bilitation nursing, food ordering and personal center. Finally, it formulates the
construction strategies including set up the service platform of doctor-patient
information symmetry and provide diversiﬁed information service content, and
also communication strategies including rich media replace text, using info‐
graphics design, as well as online information service platform design for
patients.

Introduction
Medical industry is a signiﬁcant part of social public services [1]. With the continuous
progress of social economy and life quality, People’s health awareness is also increasing.
It attaches great importance on diagnosis and treatment level, external form and addi‐
tional experience. However, public health service industries in our city are still in a stage
of development. The Ward Nurses Station, which works as a unit of information service
in the daily life of the ward, has many experience problem unresolved. Therefore, it will
better achieve the patient centered design transformation of information service platform
that recognizes complexity of information design in service system design way, analyses
touch point and has an insight into the needs of stakeholders with using Internet tech‐
nology to improve or optimize the process experience.

Information Service System for Ward Nurses Station and Service
Design Thinking
2.1
Information Service System and Related Problems in Ward Nurses Station
Nurses Station, which closely connects with pharmacy, charges and inspection services
system, is an important part of hospital information system. It’s used to support medics
in clinical activities, collective and manage patients’ data [2]. What’s more, it enables
nurse better deal with hospital bed quantity, nursing process and charge statistics. So,
Ward Nurses Station, which is based on information service system, extends daily
nursing care to patient clinic. It’s a general name for the information service in the area
of bed management, nursing administration and cost statistic, and medical order treat‐
ment (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1. Nursing station information service system
Traditional Nurses Station with the patient as the center, has simple information
point. It is isolated that health care workers and clinical patients work as two parts.
Thereby, patients are often in the state of information passive. It’s mainly reﬂects in
following aspects:
1. In the aspect of information management. Due to large and complex patients’ infor‐
mation, nurses can not make targeted care. Furthermore, information asymmetry,
which make patients in a passive situation, has been reﬂected in wards’ information
management; It also lead to low eﬃciency in bed management, nursing administra‐
tion and cost statistic, and so on.
2. In the aspect of information acquisition, a large number of medical information is
available in a single channel. Access to health knowledge, nursing information,
examination of the documents, pain assessment information and daily room service
is originally passed on orally which leads to poor information dissemination. In
addition, it is hard for patients to understand some medicines’ function and expense
invoices.
3. In the aspect of information interaction. If they lacked eﬃciently communicate and
interact with nurses, patients would recover hardly. Health care workers cannot get
recovery related mental health and other privacy issues in time. What’s more, there
is no service platform to oﬀer a relatively closed communication and interaction
718

which make nurses aware of patients’ potentially mental disorders and then take the
relevant measures.
2.2
Import of Service Design Thinking
As a result of an innovative strategy shift under the new situation [3], service system
design is a collection of material product, service ﬂow and information dissemination.
Focusing on the structure of the whole system [4] and improving user experience can
create more business value of the product when it is from the users’ point of view. The
traditional thinking of “production line model” is clearly unable to cope with the chal‐
lenges of health care services. However, service design focus from on product to on
value transfer, and make full use of Internet technology and human relations to achieve
a simpliﬁed service, so that brings excellent service experience [5]. It often takes positive
change as the goal, showing the power to change the vision and motivation of both sides,
especially combines the value proposition of business thinking with the user service
contact points in real condition [6]. What’s more, through blending appropriate quali‐
tative with quantitative thinking, new thinking in service design responds to the complex
needs of consumers [7]. It includes the use of empathy insight into user needs, ﬁnding
opportunities through the visual visualization and with the help of a prototype tool to
realize serve mode.
Take Kaiser Permanente as an example, which has improved nurse handover infor‐
mation model. The ward nurses were divided into middle shift, day shift and night shift,
so the unity and continuity of nursing information when they shift is essential for
patients’ rehabilitation. To face the problem, Kaiser Permanente and IDEO design
company work together and hope to develop a systemic and eﬀective solution which is
easy to use and transfer of information by nurses for patient safety, quality of care and
the eﬃciency of shift. IDEO conducted a continuous observation of the shift in the ward,
and then understood the way of exchanging information among nurses. In addition, they
found other factors which will aﬀect results, such as the nursing process, the manage‐
ment of patients and the records of nursing. They revealed that every nurse has its own
information priority standard and interaction manner. Thus, IDEO built an interaction
framework and placed the entry point in the information transfer, patient interaction,
information software and other aspects. Finally, combined with the speciﬁc needs of
patients, which improved the work eﬃciency of the nurses and the safety of patients,
they established a set of commonly used information interactive template for care infor‐
mation expression and importance ranking.
It can be seen in the medical service progress that patient needs penetrate the whole
life cycle of service system. Contact point of patients, health care workers, family
members and other stakeholders’ relationship is the focus of designing and exploration
which can be improved and integrated into a systematic and implemental solution.

Research Process
3.1
Analysis of Nursing Process in Ward Nurses Station
From the beginning to the end, each patient in entire business process will have a close
relationship and interact with the hospital ward nurses station. Nursing process is a
process of information exchange in the patients receiving the system. Nursing informa‐
tion ﬂow is complex, and service projects of diﬀerent patients are not the same. One day
in nursing station usually includes following: patients admission, admission assessment,
grading nursing, nursing rounds, patients discharge and other major processes. In addi‐
tion to these basic nursing operation, it needs to cooperate with ward nurse station
information system to collect and input information module relevant to patients, so as
to better serve them. The whole process of nursing information is shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2. Nursing process of nursing station in ward
From the perspective of service system, the hospitalization process is an entirety,
and each diﬀerent nursing service is a sub process of it. The goal of these sub processes
is to make patients satisﬁed with the hospital services. Meanwhile, doctors, nurses and
other stakeholders have to meet the needs of patients. Therefore, to improve hospital
management eﬃciency and experience, we need to do ﬁrst is optimizing the sub process
of the service system, and then bring along improvement of the whole service system
experience.
3.2
Analysis of Information Service Contact Points in Ward Nurses Station
All part of services in medical process can be regarded as a contact point. Including
tangible and intangible continuous system elements and spatial information, even partic‐
ipants’ behavior and emotion [8]. It could be an equipment (Nurse PC) or a service link
720
L. Zhang et al.

(Vital Signs Collection, Execution Order…), each contact point is the key point to
improve the patients’ experience. Only by improving contact point design can we enrich
and make the process more coherent. The contact points help the designer to ﬁnd out
the service that has the problem, to deﬁne and enhance the patient’s needs and the
existing services and products, and then promote interaction between station and
patients.
Admission Assessment. At ﬁrst, getting patient information, which contain patient’s
disease situation, enable hospital to meet their reasonable needs and propagate admission
process, ward environment, inpatient care attention and equipment use-methods. Subse‐
quently, the medical staﬀs need to carry out the nursing assessment, and measure patients
with vital signs information. According to collections which contain patient’s health
condition [9], they can provide an instruction for nursing plan and advice.
Many contact points are associated with ordering information checking and
executing. Through taking and consulting medical orders in nursing information system
station, nurse prints out the order items and list of drugs in the ward today be executed,
and check on distribution of drugs from dispensing room. Meanwhile, making the
implementation records and medication nursing records, doctors can read and check the
system. At present, the information system in nursing station can’t track the medical
advice life cycle. Without health care information, patients cannot get the information
of individual nursing project.
The collection of vital signs is the contact point of the information service. The nurses
measure the vital signs according to the nursing grade and the patient’s condition every
day. In general, the nurse should ﬁrst conﬁrm the identity of the patient, and then measure
the vital signs speciﬁcally. After all of these, they will input all the relevant data and
their collector into the nursing station information system. So far, this process is compli‐
cated, and way of information acquisition is single.
Nursing rounds, including the patient’s mental expression and conscious state, diet
and nutrition, etc. To grasp the latest information of the clinical situation and get in touch
with patients’ families and doctors timely for emergent problems, nurses usually peram‐
bulate three or four times around wards during their daily work. There are great possi‐
bilities for improving accuracy and eﬃciency of patients’ pain degree collection, as well
as information interaction.
Inpatient information management, which contain doctor’s orders information
management, such as its contents, execution situation and so on; Nursing information
management, such as nursing records, nursing quality, nursing evaluation and so on;
Beds information management, such as patients and beds conditions; Cost information
management, such as the hospitalization expense list, care and treatment and so on.
Every day, nurses need to eﬀectively manage these information through clinical acquis‐
ition and ward nurse station shared. At present, information management workload is
heavy, and information obtain experience for patients needs to be optimized.
Food ordering is also an important part of the system. According to the doctor’s diet
advice, the information will be sent to nutrition, and put dietary requirements and
restrictions on a car beside patient’s bedside, as a basis for the food allocation. Lack of
diet education information, the current service process is too messy to make patients
understand and follow the diet plan.

721

Therefore, it is necessary to build the online information service platform of nurse
station by Internet technology, which transmits data to desktop information system of
ward nurse station through WLAN. It is a supplementary and extended information
service platform for patients beside bed. On one hand, it will provide patients with related
service and information handily. On the other hand, it can eﬀectively promote the inter‐
action between patients and medical staﬀ, since it is an information communication
service platform for patients and medical personnel which is set up in the bed.
3.3
The Analysis and Research of Ward Nurses Station Information Service
System About Fourth People’s Hospital in Wuxi
Based on the analysis above, we set out from the nursing station in the Fourth People’s
Hospital in Wuxi. Through a series of survey methods, such as target user interview,
satisfaction survey and behavior observation, we inquired the basic situation and existing
problems of information service. At the same time, we summed up the pain points and
potential needs of patients and medical staﬀ during the ward nursing service process,
and obtains the information content and speciﬁc form. The whole research is divided
into three stages.
In the ﬁrst stage, a preliminary interview with 2 nurses in the Department of general
surgery of Wuxi Fourth People’s Hospital was conducted to understand the basic situa‐
tion and needs of the patients during hospitalization. To understand the patients’ inner
feelings, and diﬃculties of their accompanying family members and medical staﬀs, we
classiﬁed the content of the interview. Finally, we merged them into six major categories,
which include inpatient rehabilitation nursing, hospital daily service, patient information

Next, to re-examine the issue which contains six aspects, then investigation the

quantifying of user satisfaction, to screening and veriﬁcation the common question of
patients and medical staﬀ thinks. The results showed that patients are agree with the
pain points and issues about costs and project inquiries, inpatient rehabilitation care,
hospital daily service, patient information management, ordering, diet and other aspects.
It Illustrated these aspects deserve optimization and improvement.
Then the second phase, to had a depth user interviews for the 10 patients, family
members of patients and ﬁve health care workers, the ﬁve questions on a stage of further
exploration, and design needs further in-depth and reﬁnement. The results are shown in
Fig. 3.
Then the third phase, the observation of nurses one day nursing behavior, in order
to be more scientiﬁc to explore nursing services and issue in ward area, and to identify
problems in the ward area between nurses and patients, the project as a spectator to
observed nursing behavior of the day from morning to night of a nurse in Wuxi Fourth
People’s Hospital, and had in-depth conversation for some problems. The results
through the service blueprint and working pressure map (Fig. 4) and analysis the relevant
contact points. As can be seen, health care workers working in the day care pressure
index were higher, especially nine o’clock to fourteen o’clock, and there are some prob‐
lems about the interaction with the patient’s feelings, information acquisition and execu‐
tion eﬃciency.

Subsequently, had an in-depth conversation with the department’s head nurse, from
a professional view and through the entire user experience map to have an intuitive and
holistic understanding of the hospitalization process, Thereby further clear demand:
improving the patient’s ability to obtain medical information initiative, on the other hand
to improve the nurses working eﬃciency; the nurses station information service online
platform also can include service terminal, wechat platform, information manuals; and
improve the ward electronic information construction level.

Strategies and Outputs of Ward Nurses Station Information
Service System Design
Through research, analysis and summary, established the whole direction of the ward
nurse station information service system (Fig. 5), by through the establishment of the
nurses’ station assisted information online platform, redesigned and improved the
existing nursing station information systems, services in the patient’s bed management,
care management and expense management modules which is component by the partial
service terminals, wechat platform and other aspects, as a supplement to the main nursing
station, information services extended to the patient bedside, it eﬀectively enhance the
interaction with the patient and focus on optimizing contents of hospitalization infor‐
mation, improve the interactive of information, presenting information and other
aspects, Then connected service platform and the entire hospital information system to
build the whole information service system as taking patients as the core.
Fig. 5. The direction of ward nursing station information service system
4.1
Establish Doctor and Patients Symmetrical Information Service Platform
Equality between doctors and patients information acquisition, patient ward can provide
online information service platform of nurse station, and it is connected to the main
nursing station, it could share information, thus provide some beds, fees, nursing care
and other medical services information for patients, to facilitate patient search;
Secondly, the information platform also taking into account the state of the patient’s
condition and personal ﬁtness, and push some medical information with the individual
property features, then personalized interactive information, such as the rehabilitation
of fracture information, daily mood message and attendance, and then provide reason‐
able services to meet patients’ needs. Meanwhile, the medical staﬀ and patients are in
the same information service system, they can constantly exchange information and
interaction between them, and to some extent, it realized real-time information sharing.
724
L. Zhang et al.

4.2
Provide Diversiﬁed of Information Services
Provides the daily costs list of hospitalization by electronic way, and will provide the
list of hospital costs of yesterday, and timely to correct any errors. Take the form of the
list to design the information, it mainly to provide information on: cost type, project
name, price and speciﬁcations, quantity and amount. Each item of information is in a
column, left-aligned, and the cost of the same type attribute would be restructure and
collation. The Important usual pharmaceutical signed by ﬁve-pointed star-mark, and the
patient can view the drug eﬀects by click on pop-ups. Drug market take the same form
of the list to design the information, navigation position could provide the ﬁrst level
information, that the drug category (medicine, Chinese medicine and herbal medicine),
and the secondary market have more detailed information.
Provide rehabilitation care information, such as fracture departments provide
recovery after fractures and how to avoid secondary fractures; obstetrics and gynecology
departments can provide care knowledge of nurse babies, and post-natal care, etc. Infor‐
mation arranged in the form of a springboard layout style, then the information use rich
media formats, combined with the speciﬁc rehabilitation topics picture or video guidance
information, that patients can also be read by clicking the module (Fig. 6).
Fig. 6. Rehabilitation nursing module
Fig. 7. Daily attendance message
Provide the nurse service project every day, namely the completed project and
unﬁnished project of the nurse service in each day, and what is the speciﬁc implemen‐
tation of nurse service projects, like executor, execution time and doctor’s care
programs, include Long-term program or care program. When patients are in full screen
view by follow the care program, it will automatically switch to a diﬀerent thumbnail
view of diﬀerent days, then patients can click on the appropriate date to see the corre‐
sponding care programs.
Also provides daily hospitalization services information, including: Admission and
discharge guidance, departments and medical staﬀ, ward maps. The information, use
rich media formats, are arranged in the form of a springboard layout style, to combine
the pictures, in line with the guidance of the subject matter of admission, could reﬂect
the theme of feature as much as possible. In addition, making a reservation by the way

of information, presentation of recipes by combining the pictures, then using a list or
gallery.
4.3
Build Multi-faceted Clinical Interaction of Nurse-Patient
It is necessary to build an interactive platform to leave comments, through a wireless
local area network technology and real-time connect the ward nurses station, patients
could leave voice or text massage the relevant issues about hospitalization in the infor‐
mation platform, in the another way, the medical staﬀ could arrange fragmented time,
and reply the patients’ massages by wireless network.
Construct the interactive platform of mood (Fig. 7), the moods are all use cartoon
face, and the color will occur after select. And then by choosing diﬀerent cartoon
expressions to reﬂect their feelings, and leave their doubts and the massage they want
to say, then nurses could screening some patients in a bad mood for targeted psycho‐
logical care through the platform, it is enhance the interaction and communication of
nurses and patients.
Construct satisfaction evaluation interactive platform for nurses care satisfaction
rating during hospitalization, every nurse using point to praise and comment way,
breaking the traditional form of complex multiple-choice questions. After the point, the
number of nurse’ point will be displayed, In addition it can also combine patients’
comment to write the detail evaluation for nurse, and when the patient reviews
completed, the icon style will change.
Safety reminder platform that can automatically remind patients and nurses, in the
form of dialog, it is important to push timely information. For example, about two hours
to turn the body, knock back, urging the nurse to do a turn over care, but also urge patients
and their families. In addition, for some special cases of emergency, patients could use
“nurse call” feature to make voice calls and interaction with the medical staﬀ of the
nursing station at the ﬁrst time.
4.4
Improve the Service of the Ward Details Service Information Design
Beside to pay attention to the patient’s condition care, the hospital also follow others
service during hospitalization, it also related to the rehabilitation of the disease and
satisfaction. For example, it can provide accommodation information, magazines of
disease care, milk and supper for the family members who accompanying the patient.
For patients, the hospital can provide convenient setting during hospitalization, decom‐
pression soothing music. Whenever the patient was discharged or catch up with holiday
time, the hospital can prepare for some small gift: a free cup of coﬀee ticket, an illness
rehabilitation manual or notebooks. Through these, it can shows the hospital take much
count of each patient’s hospitalization experience, it provide a positive opportunity for
interaction between patients and medical staﬀ.
726

4.5
With the Interactive Tools of Non-text to Improve the Eﬃciency and the
Experience of the Transmission of Information
For the convey of medical information, if we want to break the traditional paper-based
text communication, it should to use some rich media forms, like image, audio, anima‐
tion, etc. and present the medical information to patients abundantly and eﬃciently, then
to guide patients through the sound operation, vividly shows recovery points and
methods of disease. It is helpful for patients who have diﬀerent cultural level, and for
elderly patients are more easily understood and accepted.
To clearly the convey theme of medical information, guide patients interact with
them. It should provide a visual hierarchy information for patients, reﬁned medical
information, to have a guiding force, and combined with rich media formats, enjoys
popular support language to make resonance, let patient involved, to guide actively
cooperate with treatment.
Active use the information visualization and data visualization, make the information
and data restructuring and consolidation, then it also can be deleted and hided, etc. And
converted to radius graphics or cartoon faces, also can combined with humorous
language, it is easy to people understanding, thus making the patient to be more willing
to accept, use cold warm color to distinguish the information attribute, the warm colors
are important and positive elements, it could use line graph, pie and bar chart to presen‐
tation and comparison the data. To facilitate patients comparison and understanding.

Abstract. The study aims at developing an instrument measuring Chinese
medical beliefs held by Chinese adults. In an online survey, participants were
asked to rate their agreement with 35 Chinese medical beliefs. 257 valid responses
from Chinese adults were collected. Exploratory factor analysis indicates that
Chinese medical beliefs of Chinese adults are loaded onto seven factors of
preventive diet, traditional health practices, preferences of TCM and western
medicine, energy concept in TCM, medicated diet, pathogenic factor, and TCM
hesitation. The study points out some Chinese medical beliefs held by Chinese
adults.

Introduction
Culture inﬂuences people’s health-seeking behaviors, so we should pay attention to it
in the health-care service design. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is
widely adopted among Chinese people. TCM is a unique medical system, which
stemmed from ancient times [1] and thrives until today. It inﬂuences Chinese people’s
(even Asians’) perceptions and behaviors related to health and medical service in many
ways. For example, a woman needs “doing the month” after childbirth, meaning that
she must observe a period of conﬁnement and taboos and that she must not wash her
hair during the period of conﬁnement [2].
Nowadays, most doctors in China are educated under Western medical educational
systems. Doctors are often unaware of the complex Chinese culture that influences their
patients’ responses to care [3]. Discrepancies of medical beliefs between doctors and
patients would probably lead to distrust in healing process. Despite that researchers have
noticed the impact of Chinese medical beliefs on Chinese immigrants’ behavior [2, 4–7],
there are few explicit ways to measure people’s Chinese medical beliefs to our knowledge.
This study aims at developing an instrument measuring Chinese medical beliefs held
by Chinese adults. The instrument will help doctors understand patients’ medical beliefs,
thus provide speciﬁc treatment to patients.

Literature Review
2.1
TCM Concepts
TCM concepts are summarized as the foundation of the instrument. The concepts include
Yin-yang, Five phases, Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism.
Yin-Yang. The yin and yang are complementary opposite forces. Everything has both
the yin and yang aspects. They control the relationship between humans and environ‐
ment together with the “qi” energy [8]. In the health context, an imbalance in these two
forces or in the ‘qi’ results in illnesses [9]. Food has its cold or hot characteristics. Thus,
Chinese patients usually take special foods and herbs according to the season to balance
either yin or yang in order to enhance their energy [3].
Five Phases. According to this theory, all phenomena in the universe are the products
of the movement of ﬁve qualities: wood, ﬁre, earth, metal and water. The organs corre‐
spond to each of the phase. For example, liver corresponds to wood, heart to ﬁre, spleen
to earth, lung to metal, and kidney to water. Organs interacts each other in illness. Thus,
patients would ask for medication to protect the organs related to their target organ [3].
Taoism. The Taoism philosophy advocates non-action, or ‘let-it-be’. According to this
philosophy, one should not overdo anything [3]. Taoism emphasizes the importance of
keeping harmony with nature. It is believed that being harmony with nature will provide
peace of mind, and promote good health [10].
Confucianism. The Confucian philosophy plays an important role in Chinese society.
It reminds people that they are destined by heaven to complete their mission. The
Confucianism advocates chung-yung, which asks people to maintain a neutral position
when examining all phenomena [3]. This belief may contribute to Chinese patients’
hesitation about receiving Western medicine surgery, since they consider Western treat‐
ments too aggressive to incorporate with the natural recovery speed [9, 11].
Buddhism. Buddhism believes fate and “inn kuo” (cause and eﬀect) are the key factors
of health [12]. Most Chinese Buddhists with malignant disease usually attributes the
cause of disease to their sin, and they tend to have self-blame responses [3]. Buddhism
has pessimistic thoughts, which may make the doctor and patient lack conﬁdence.
Guided by these philosophies, people with Chinese medical beliefs may have special
considerations for dietary, medicine, daily practices and so on.
2.2
Inﬂuence of Chinese Medical Beliefs
There are diﬀerent aspects of Chinese medical beliefs. Lai et al.’s investigates 12 cultural
health beliefs held by older Chinese in Canada, and these beliefs are loaded onto three
factors about traditional health practices, beliefs about traditional Chinese medicine, and
beliefs about preventive diet [7]. In a study conducted in Malaysia, researchers inter‐
viewed 50 Malaysian Chinese from the general public and 50 Chinese medical students
730
R. Zhong et al.

about 22 items. It was found that there was a discrepancy in the extent of these beliefs
among the general public and Chinese medical students [2].
Chinese medical beliefs inﬂuence Chinese immigrants’ utilization of health-care
service like mammography screening [13, 14], cancer services [5], and mental illness
services [15]. Yeo et al. found that Chinese-Australians maintained traditional Chinese
beliefs about cancer, such as explaining it as karma or retribution, despite their high
acculturation [5]. Another example was that Chinese were not very aware of mental
illness. They interpreted it more as somatic symptoms [16]. Researchers argued that
these perceptions were possible barriers to access of appropriate health service.
Though quite a few studies are conducted abroad, Chinese medical beliefs held by
Chinese adults are rarely found in China, where TCM originates. So this study was
carried out to measure the Chinese medical beliefs held by Chinese adults living in
China.

Research Questions and Methods
3.1
Research Questions
The following research questions are proposed for this study.
Q1: What are Chinese medical beliefs held by Chinese people?
First, items that could be representative of Chinese medical beliefs should be
selected.
Q2: What is Chinese adults’ agreement with these Chinese medical beliefs?
Chinese adults’ agreement with Chinese these items are measured to identify the
degree to which Chinese medical beliefs are endorsed by Chinese adults.
Q3: What are the dimensions of the Chinese medical beliefs?
To understand the underlying structure of the items measuring Chinese medical
beliefs, factor analysis could be used to identify the dimension of Chinese medical
beliefs.
3.2
Questionnaire Design
Questionnaire survey was adopted as the research method. The questionnaire consisted
of two parts. The ﬁrst part was to collect demographic information of the participants
and their experiences in using TCM, including gender, age, occupation, profession,
education level, marital status, birthplace, current residence, frequency of visiting TCM
last year, place of visiting TCM, causes of visiting TCM and cumulative time of taking
TCM.
The second part was to measure Chinese adults’ agreement with Chinese medical
beliefs. In this study, the items measuring Chinese medical beliefs were selected from
Chew et al.’s [2] and Lai et al.’s studies [7]. The researchers also added 5 items about
Chinese medical beliefs according to life experience. The Chinese medical beliefs were
about cause of disease, diet taboo, daily habit, folk prescription, and attitude towards TCM.
Measuring Chinese Medical Beliefs of Chinese Adults
731

The items were measured by 7-point Likert scales. 1 represents strongly disagree, 7 repre‐
sents strongly agree, and 4 represents neutral or never heard of this item. The translations
were checked by one undergraduate student majoring in English. Then the questionnaires
were plot tested by two human factors engineering PhD students to prevent ambiguity. A
few adjustments were made, such as adding the interpretation of professional word “wind”
in TCM. As a result, a questionnaire is constructed with 35 items measuring Chinese
medical beliefs. One of the 35 items is reverse item (Item 19).
3.3
Participants
The questionnaires were uploaded on sojump, an online questionnaire system. Then the
online questionnaires were distributed via Wechat, a social media in China. RMB 2-
worth of “Red Packet” was rewarded to each participant. Ultimately this study collected
293 responses, among which 257 questionnaires were valid.
The ﬁnal sample consisted of 101 Chinese males and 156 Chinese females. The mean
age of the participants is 25.2 years old (SD = 5.5). The oldest is 52 years old and the
youngest is 18 years old. More than 80 % report an undergraduate education level or
above. More than 80 % report that they are unmarried. The sample covers various occu‐
pation and profession.
About frequency of visiting TCM last year, 63 % report that they didn’t visit TCM
last year. 33.1 % visited TCM 1~5 times last year. 2.3 % visited TCM 6~10 times. 1.6 %
visited TCM more than 10 times. Among the 95 participants visiting TCM last year,
40.0 % visited in large hospitals, 25.3 % in community hospitals, 38.9 % in clinic and
20.0 % in other places. Most of the participants (55.8 %) visited TCM because of chronic
disease. Nearly 75 % of the participants have ever taken TCM.

Results
4.1
Agreement with Chinese Medical Beliefs
To identify the degree to which Chinese medical beliefs are endorsed by Chinese adults,
we summarize the mean and standard deviation of each item. Table 1 presents 10 Chinese
medical beliefs with highest agreement in this study. For example, “9. Eating too much
deep-fried food will cause Shanghuo.” (M = 5.89, SD = 1.32) “Shanghuo” is a widely
a term in TCM, with common symptoms like sore throat, feeling hot and dry, or getting
pimples. This statement is highly agreed among Chinese adults. The item with second
highest agreement is “1. Certain diseases are caused by ‘too much heat’ or ‘too much
coldness’ in the body (disruption of yin-yang balance).” (M = 5.67, SD = 1.35) This
item is the explanation of illness based on the yin-yang theory. The item with third
highest agreement is “11. Soup is good for health.” (M = 5.63, SD = 1.27) This is a
dietary norm to maintain health.

The Chinese medical beliefs with lowest agreement includes: “33. If you have taken
TCM prior to visiting your doctor, would you be uncomfortable to reveal to your doctor
that you have taken TCM prior to the consultation?” (M = 2.78, SD = 1.8) This item is
measuring the hesitation attitude towards TCM. It turns out that patients don’t mind
talking about TCM to their doctors, perhaps because TCM is well-known around
Chinese people in China. “2. Fever is due to excessive heat inside the body” (M = 3.19,
SD = 1.58) and “13. One should consume less amount of rice or totally abstain from
taking rice when having fever” (M = 3.43, SD = 1.63) also receive low agreement,
perhaps because these two items violate the interpretation of fever with modern medi‐
cine–fevers are commonly caused by bacterial/viral infections.
4.2
Exploratory Factor Analysis
We used exploratory factor analysis to explore the factor structure of the remaining
34 items of Chinese medical beliefs, after removing the reverse item. The results of
the Kaiser–Mayer–Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett’s test of sphericity were .893 and
𝜒 2 = 3698.2 (p < .001), suggesting being suitable for factor analysis.
In the factor extracting and screening phase, the following rules were adopted:
extracting components with eigenvalues larger than 1 as principal component; deleting
items with loadings smaller than .45 on all common factors; deleting factors containing
only one item [17, 18]. 6 items were dropped according to the rules above. For example,
one item about combining both TCM and modern medicine together was dropped
Measuring Chinese Medical Beliefs of Chinese Adults
733

because it was the only item in the factor. Verimax rotation with Kaiser normalizing
rotation was used acquire a meaningful explanation of the model.
Finally, 28 items were retained. The 28 items composed of seven factors and
explained 61.7 % of the total variance. The seven factors were named as preventive diet,
traditional health practices, preferences of TCM and western medicine, energy concept
in TCM, medicated diet, pathogenic factor, and TCM hesitation. The seven factors
accounted for 17.3 %, 9.0 %, 8.4 %, 8.2 %, 7.3 %, 6.5 %, and 5.0 % of the variance,
respectively.
Preventive diet describes about folk prescription and dietary restrictions during
one’s illness, such as “drinking momordica grosvenori tea can clear the lung and
decrease internal heat” and “consuming certain food like garlic and ginger can help
dispel wind from the body.”
Traditional health practices describe about traditional practices that Chinese like
to follow. Typical example is women’s conﬁnement in childbirth, which is commonly
known as “zuo yue zi” in Chinese.
Preference of TCM and western medicine describes people’s preference when
facing TCM and western medicine. Items in this factor are about choosing TCM alone
as the initial treatment choice and hesitation in receiving western medicine.
Energy concept in TCM describes the interpretation of energy in TCM, like “wind”
or excessive heat could cause related illness.
Medicated diet consists of beliefs about Chinese herbal medicine and tonic food. It
is believed homology of medicine and food, namely, choosing appropriate food can act
as medicine and enhance the immunity.
Pathogenic factor describes about the cause of disease, such as “having too much
cold food or drink will cause dizziness” and “exposure to rain water can cause respiratory
tract infection”.
TCM hesitation is vague, consisting of only two items. One is about patient’s hesi‐
tation in telling doctors that s/he has taken TCM prior to the consultation. The other is
consuming less amount of rice when having fever.

Discussion
The study aims at developing an instrument measuring Chinese medical beliefs held by
Chinese adults. By exploratory factor analysis, seven factors are identiﬁed about preven‐
tive diet, traditional health practices, preferences of TCM and western medicine, energy
concept in TCM, medicated diet, pathogenic factor, and TCM hesitation. Factor 1 to
Factor 6 are reliable with acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s α > .60).
However, Factor 7 (TCM hesitation) is vague, with low reliability (Cronbach’s α = .
396). This factor could be revised or removed in the future.
The study points out some Chinese medical beliefs physicians should notice in
medical practice and communication. The instrument will help in the following aspects.
First, the instrument could serve as a way to measure the extent to which people hold
Chinese medical beliefs. Physicians educated under Western medical system also need
to know what Chinese medical beliefs the patients have so that they could answer
734
R. Zhong et al.

patients’ questions and make appropriate treatment plan. Second, as we identify seven
factors about Chinese medical beliefs, the instrument could further measure people’s
acceptance with TCM in diﬀerent subscales, such as dietary, traditional practices. Third,
the instrument could be used to identify which subscale has a good predict eﬀect on
people’s medical choice.
There are a few limitations of this study, suggesting improvement direction of the
instrument. First, the samples are mainly younger Chinese adults and the education level
is relatively high. Since age may inﬂuence Chinese medical beliefs according to [19],
sampling from more general population including diﬀerent age levels and education
background should be adopted in future study. Besides, the validity of the instrument is
not yet veriﬁed. In-depth interview with TCM experts should be required to verify
whether the items in each factor are representative enough as Chinese medical beliefs.
What’s more, Chinese medical believers and Western medical believers could be invited
to prove the validity of the instrument. The future study could examine the impact of
age, education level, overseas experience on Chinese medical beliefs.

Conclusion
In this study, we preliminarily develop an instrument measuring Chinese medical beliefs
held by Chinese adults. Exploratory factor analysis indicates that the Chinese medical
beliefs are loaded onto seven factors of preventive diet, traditional health practices,
preferences of TCM and western medicine, energy concept in TCM, medicated diet,
pathogenic factor, and TCM hesitation. The study points out some Chinese medical
beliefs held by Chinese adults. Physicians should pay attention to these Chinese medical
beliefs in medical practice and communication.

Abstract. When a consumer walks into a point of purchase, their eyes start to
search for the product they want. This study aims to investigate into the
applications of the signs on shower gel package. For the mainstream applica-
tions, we have the following ﬁndings: In terms of packaging shape, press type is
the mainstream of bottle head, while the body is largely rectangular solid. In
terms of color, white is the mainstream. For the text on the package, we have at
least six types of major text information, such as brand name, skin improvement
effect, ingredient, aroma, attribute and volume. For text presentation, original
characters are the mainstream. For packaging patterns, plant is the mainstream
application, and realistic depiction is another mainstream in their presentation.
In terms of packaging material, shower gel bottles are mainly made of
non-transparent plastics. In this study, we have conducted a more extensive
research, analyzing the applications of signs on the shower gel package in the
market, and will make them available to designers or marketers as a reference.

Introduction
Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) refer generally to the products with short
service life, fast consumption and high frequency of purchase in the market [1]. FMCG
commonly appear in our daily lives, frequently seen and highly dependable. They seem
to have become one of the largest, most proﬁtable and rapidly growing industries in the
world [2]. In Taiwan, the purchase rate of cleaning supplies goes up to 56.34 %,
ranking the highest in all FMCG categories. Among them, shower gel has the highest at
60.33 %, above shampoo (55.61 %) and facial cleanser (53.08 %) [3]! Obviously,
cleaning supplies in Taiwan, with high development potential, deserve our exploration,
especially shower gel. The trait to grab consumer attention has become a necessary
condition for a product to stand out from a variety of similar ones and then taken into
consideration by the consumer [4]. However, how does a product successfully attract
the attention of consumers? Packaging is the carrier and key used to perform this
function [5, 6].

When a consumer enters a point of purchase, they can often see all types of
products. Armstrong and Kotler [7] pointed out that a typical supermarket sells as many
as 15,000 kinds of items on average. Each consumer, however, can browse only about
300 items per minute, and just two-thirds of them have access to consumer attention
[8]. Therefore most people tend to see the information provided on the package as the
main clue for product selection and purchase [9]. Packaging not only provides product
information, but also plays as the basis of determining the properties of its product in
the consumer’s purchase decision process [10–12]. A packaging sign, if clear enough
in its design and classiﬁcation, can even help simplify this process [13, 14]. Many
studies have also found that any sign on the package is likely to induce consumers to
make a purchase [11, 15]. In contrast, few academics have focused their research on the
investigation of the signs on shower gel package. Accordingly, this study has the
following two aims. First, to launch an extensive collection, observation and investi-
gation into the applications of the signs on shower gel package. Second, on the basis of
past literature, to analyze the trend of packaging signs that may affect the consumer’s
attention and purchase behavior.

Literature Review
When a consumer has decided what to buy in a store, when they will see is various
brands of products greeting to them. This selection process is like a man/woman
wooing their object, starting to introduce and promote themselves, using all means to
pursue and go with them. How does the consumer select their favorite from those
aggressive competitors? First impression! This idea is a total combination of all
physical features and their advantageous impressions. Therefore, this leading product
must be able to attract the consumer’s attention by virtue of its appearance (facial
features, body). Product appearance, known as packaging, has some signs on it to form
the leading product and help the consumer with their evaluation. “Functions and
importance of packaging”, “communication of signs on the package” and “signs and
elements on shower gel packaging” are discussed in the literature review of this study.
2.1
Functions and Importance of Packaging
Packaging has a protective effect for the contents of the product, which is the most
important and basic function [7, 16]. Packaging isolates the product from external
environment, keeping it out of hazardous factors. In addition, packaging can split the
contents of the product into proper share for the convenience of easy carrying, as well
as for efﬁcient transport and storage [17–19]. Packaging is known as a “silent sales-
person” [20], and plays a vital role from the perspective of sales promotion. Product
packaging can attract consumer attention through a variety forms and visual techniques
of colors, signs and advertising, while such information as the product features,
directions for use, brand names and product images can also be conveyed for better
communication with the consumer [19], and noticeable differentiation that helps the
consumer make a quicker purchase decision among all kinds and sorts of product

categories [21]. Accordingly, this study aims to explore more about the applications of
packaging signs.
2.2
Communication of Signs on the Package
Sight is one of human’s most important sensory functions [22], and packaging is the
ﬁrst step of the consumer’s contact with the product. Successful packaging can grab
their eyeballs [23]. Information and signs on the package provide clues for the con-
sumer to make a judgment on product quality [24], and shape the consumer’s
expectation for product properties, smells and experience, stimulating their purchase
behavior [25, 26]. Signs are everywhere and comprehensive in category [27]. The
so-called “sign” is a kind of physical characterization. It needs to be identiﬁed by the
user and then received through human organs to both interpret what it refers to and
create effective communication [28]. In short, signs are a vehicle used to convey
meaning. They represent certain things and concepts, and make sense after understood
and interpreted in different context [27]. Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–
1913) was the ﬁrst scholar to study signs as a new subject. He found signs are com-
posed by two elements – the signiﬁer and the signiﬁed, a “dual relationship.” The
signiﬁer refers to the speciﬁc image of a sign. It can be perceived and received by the
human senses; the signiﬁed is concept formed by a sign on the human mind. Signs
contain two-axis interactions, namely paradigmatic axis and syntagmatic axis [28]; in
the actual process of communication, the two of them need to be closely combined and
are indivisible [29]. The paradigmatic axis is characteristic of analyzing its constituent
elements, while the syntagmatic axis is used for sign extension, and to show full
meaning of the signs. This study aims to only generalize and analyze the content of
“signiﬁer” on the package of a shower gel bottle and its presentation.
2.3
Sign Elements on Shower Gel Package
In the purchase decision process of most consumers for low-involvement products,
packaging signs have become an important basis of whether they will make a purchase
[30]. Although the signs on the package are plentiful, research on the packaging of
cleaning products for personal use, such as shower gel, has been scarce. However,
many elements of the signs on the package can still be explored. Smith and Taylor [31]
noted that the shape, size, color, pattern, material and smell are the six essential
elements for creating effective packaging. In addition, many scholars believe that the
study of signs on the package should focus on the four elements of color, shape, text
and pattern [9, 32, 33]. In addition to the shape, text, color, and pattern as the subjects
of study, Silayoi and Speece [30] treated product information and packaging technique
as his research priorities. Kuvykaite et al. [34] included not only the shape, color and
pattern, but also package size, material, brand, country of origin, producer and product
information into the packaging elements to be explored. Moreover, Adam and Ali [35]
also added packaging size and material, on top of the four basic elements of shape,
type, color and pattern, into their discussion. In this study, we have summarized the
literature and taken the top ﬁve frequently-viewed elements – shape, color, text, pattern

and material – as the subjects of study. Our later analysis of the signs on shower gel
packaging is in accordance with the above subjects.

Research Methods
3.1
Sample Collection
In Taiwan, people most often buy shower gel in a hypermarket [36, 37], and Carrefour
has been ranked No. one in the retail store option over the last ﬁve years. Therefore, in
this study we visited 3 different Carrefour hypermarkets in Taipei for a cross reference
of the item, with the shower gel packaging recurring in the stores being the sample of
collection. As imported shower gel is ﬁlling up the market, according to our prelimi-
nary observation, we excluded package information shown other than in Chinese or
English to avoid complexity of the language (such as the text message on the label).
We had a total of 219 samples.
3.2
Sample Survey
A two-stage survey is adopted in this study. The ﬁrst stage was conducted by natural
observation method, with preliminary investigation into the signs on the shower gel
package. The second stage went with summarization and analysis based on the top ﬁve
packaging elements. In terms of styling, Wang and Sun’s [38] research was used as a
basis to explore the applications of signs on the bottle head and body. In terms of color,
based on Chang et al. [39], the color tickets in PCCS (Practical Color Co-ordinate
System) offered by Japan Color Research Institute were used as the standard to explore
the sign trends. In terms of text, studies have shown that front label, compared with the
back label, is more likely to affect a consumer’s purchase decision [40, 41]; for the
signs of text message, this study focuses only on the front label of shower gel pack-
aging for information collection and discussion. In addition, with Wu’s [42] research as
the basis, we explored sign applications about text presentation. In terms of patterns,
after observing the types of illustrations, with Meyer and Laveson’s [43] research as the
basis, sign applications about the illustration styles were also surveyed. In terms of
materials, with Vilnai-Yavetz and Koren’s [44] research as the basis, sign applications
about material transparency were explored as well.

Result and Analysis
4.1
Summary and Analysis of Shape Sign Applications
In the observation of this study, we found that the head of the shower gel bottle can be
divided into press type, ﬂip-cap and screw-cap types. Among them, press type is the
mainstream in the applications of shower gel bottle head (196/89.5 %), followed by
ﬂip-cap (17/7.76 %) and screw-cap (6/2.74 %) types. In addition, the body of shower
gel bottle can be sorted, according to their shapes, into rectangular solid, trapezium,
cylinder, square, handle, S-shaped, 3-shaped, fat belly, C-shaped and irregular type (see
Table 1). For the percentage of all bottle shapes, rectangular solid is the mainstream in

Summary and Analysis of Color Sign Applications
The classiﬁcation in this study is based on the color tickets in PCCS offered by Japan
Color Research Institute. After preliminary observation, the number is reduced to 15
categories. For a precise judgement in this study, the largest block in a colored area of
shower gel package is our target. We observed that the mainstream colors of shower gel
packaging are white (81/36.99 %), followed by blue (21/9.59 %), pink (16/7.31 %),
orange (15/6.85 %), purple (14/6.39 %), green (13/5.94 %), brown and yellow green
(10/4.57 % for each), grey and black (9/4.11 % for each), yellow (8/3.65 %), red and
violet (4/1.83 % for each), red purple (3/1.37 %), and olive (2/0.91 %).
4.3
Summary and Analysis of Text Sign Applications
In the observation of this study, we found that text signs on the package can be divided,
according to their information properties, into 17 categories shown below: brand name,
year of the brand, product’s special name, manufacturer’s name, ingredient, skin
improvement effect, psychological effect, aroma, applicable object, attribute, recom-
mendation and certiﬁcation, technique, place of origin, volume, product uniqueness,
product number and additional information (see Table 2), with each bottle package
containing 5.59 types of information on average. For mainstream applications of the
text messages on a shower gel package, brand name (97.26 %) appears on almost every
package, followed by skin improvement effect (86.76 %), ingredients contained
(57.53 %), aroma (53.9 %), attributes and volume (42 % for each), psychological
experience (27.4 %), product’s special name (22.83 %), the applicable object (19.2 %),
manufacturer’s name (16.9 %), product uniqueness (15.98 %), place of origin
(15.53 %), year of the brand (11.42 %), recommendation and certiﬁcation (10.5 %),
product number and ingredients not contained (9.13 % for each), technique (3.65 %),
and additional information (3.2 %).
After our observation, we only analyzed the presentation of the most noticeable text
– key information of the product – on the shower gel package. Original characters are
the mainstream application of text sign on shower gel package (150/68.5 %), followed
by variant characters (59/26.9 %) and the hand-painted characters (8/4.60 %). In
addition, we further cross-referenced text information and text presentation. No. 1 is
brand name as the key information (152/69.41 %), followed by skin improvement
effect (25/11.42 %), ingredients (12/5.48 %), product’s special name and aroma
(11/5.02 % for each), attribute (4/1.83 %), as well as the psychological effect and
applicable object (2/0.91 %).

pattern sign on shower gel package (36.53 %), followed by personal ﬁgure and abstract
image (15.07 % for each), fruit (7.76 %), water imagery (7.31 %), animal (5.94 %),
no image (5.02 %), natural phenomenon and protective imagery (3.65 % for each). In
terms of the illustration style, most of the patterns on shower gel packaging are using
realistic depiction (100/45.66 %), followed by symbolic depiction (69/31.51 %) and
photographic depiction (39/17.81 %); pure text is low in percentage (11/5.02 %).

Summary and Analysis of Material Sign Applications
After observation, we found that most of the shower gel packaging is made of plastics.
According to its visual representation, it can be divided into “transparent” and
“non-transparent” categories. Our analysis shows that the majority of our samples are
non-transparent (164/74.89 %) and those with transparent materials account for only a
quarter (55/25.11 %).
4.6
Total Summary of Packaging Sign Applications
In the summary of the application trends and surveys mentioned above, we are pre-
senting a ﬁnding that the same concept of paradigmatic axis and syntagmatic axis is
used in an identical brand of shower gel. This helps promote not only the diversity of
the packaging signs, but also differentiation among products of different targets. In
conclusion, we have applied the two axes of semiotics in this study (see Table 4).

Conclusion and Suggestion
With the full development of fast moving consumer goods, successful arousal of
consumer’s desire to make a purchase lies in the signs on the package being able to
draw the consumer’s attention. This study is focused on the applications of signs on the
shower gel package. In terms of packaging form, press type is the mainstream of bottle
head. For the bottle shape, rectangular solid is the mainstream. In terms of color, white
is the mainstream of sign applications, based on the PCCS color system developed by
Japan Color Research Institute. For the text on the package, we found at least six types
of text information on average, seen as the mainstream, contained in the package of
each shower gel brand. They are brand name, skin improvement effect, ingredient,
aroma, attribute and volume. For the presentation of text, original characters are the
mainstream. For packaging patterns, plant is the mainstream application, and realistic
depiction is another mainstream in their presentation. In terms of packaging material,
shower gel bottles are generally made of plastics, and our analysis found that most of
them are non-transparent.
As this study is limited by such factors as time, budget, short-handedness and so on,
there is still some room for improvement, including further study and discussion on
many related issues. We are hereby making some points for future research: (1) For the
research on personal cleaning supplies, we only explored shower gel packaging. We
suggest a study and comparison in the future for other personal cleaning products, such

as shampoo, facial cleanser, toothpaste and so on. (2) For the scope of the sample
collection, we made sample collection for this study only in hypermarket Carrefour.
We suggest a broader range of collection for the future, such as a large chain super-
market or other outlets, so that the collected samples will become closer to the actual
market. (3) For the classiﬁcation of samples, this research is based on personal sub-
jective observation. We suggest a further classiﬁcation where focus groups with dif-
ferent perspectives are invited or interviews with experts are held, so that a different or
even more interesting result might be obtained. (4) For consumer testing, we suggest
reference for the future to the survey result in the above combination of sign application
on shower gel package, as well as a discussion about how the consumer interpret these
signs, or what signs can excite their attention, stimulate their information search and
have them make a purchase decision.

Abstract. With the development of service economy, some companies enter
new service business such as tourism, culture or leisure industry. Traditional
companies then become a product-service complex which works in a product
service system.
Yangshan Peach is a traditional brand of agricultural products company group
in China. Under the development in recent years, it is becoming a regional brand
involving tourism and culture experience. In this case, new branding strategy
should be designed. This paper is to analyze the branding process of Yangshan
from product to service then to get insight about the brand equity and brand
engagement. The relationship between customer and service brand equity has
been concluded in case study analysis.
Keywords: Brand · Service branding · Brand-customer relationship · Brand
equity · Brand engagement
1
Research Background
As the rise of the service economy is changing the framework of conventional business,
some traditional product companies have been converting into product-service complex
(Wilson et al. 2008) with the changing of brand value and brand engagement, the
meaning of brand and method of branding have also been changed. Being diﬀerent from
product brands, service brands are executed as somehow heterogeneous, intangible and
inseparable from the service provider. As delivering a consistent experience seems more
important than before, designers are suggested to think diﬀerently about branding strat‐
egies (Llopis 2014).
1.1
Theory Background
As De Chernatony and Dall’Olmo Riley (1997) stated, “a brand is the link between
ﬁrms’ marketing activities and consumers’ perceptions of functional and emotional
elements in their experience with the product and the way it is presented”. This link can

be viewed in terms of the relationship between consumers and brands and that under‐
standing consumer-brand bonds in terms of relationship marketing principles will assist
marketers in enhancing brand value (Jillian et al. 2002).
Service brand is about more than relationship between companies and customers, it
could also include relationship between all stakeholders (Bollen and Emes 2008). For
example, customer behavior could be seen as branding which expressing the meaning
of service. Because of this, the brand equity of service tends to be redeﬁned. Brand
awareness and brand meaning can be seen as fundamental factor of service brand equity
(Berry 2000). Service Branding Model (Fig. 1) also diﬀers in degree from product
branding model.

Yangshan: Brand Not Only About Peach
Yangshan is one of the largest peach farmland in China, Jiangsu province, Wuxi, which
is approximately 14000 hectares. People have planted peach there for more than 700
years and now there are about 13000 peach farmers and 700 companies.
Yangshan as a brand of peach represents a style of life: keep health and enjoy the
nature. Volcano geopark locates in the west of Wuxi where is famous for its beautiful
four hills, geological Heritage, cultural spots and botanic garden. As the Yangshan
Volcano brings mineral rich tephra to farmland, peaches can be planted without chemical
fertilizer, which means Yangshan Peach is organic.
With 41 % forest coverage and volcanic landform, Yangshan is an ideal place for
leisure tourism, especially for those citizens living nearby. In another aspect, average
lifetime of the peach trees is around 12 years which means farmers do not have income
during the time period they plant new peach trees. Because of this, farmers always take
part in the local cooperative which oﬀer diﬀerent jobs to local people.
With the development of tourism, catering and family outing service, Yangshan is
no longer merely a product brand but a brand of service system which represents culture
and lifestyle.
“Happy Farmhouse” (Fig. 2) is a new tourism project developed in recent years.
People experience local culture and social relationship through events held by the hosts.

Yangshan Happy Farmhouse is supported by Yangshan Cooperative which organize
farmers to grow organic food and build view point. Farmers will also host tourist in their
house and enjoy Peach Festival together.

Diﬀerence Between Product Brand and Service Brand
Classic product brand is about product itself, as product doesn’t answer back customers
and perform the same every experience with a product brand tends to be identical. On
the contrary, service brands are about people. The people’s behavior including customer
attitude, image of corporate employee, service price or environment can aﬀect service
branding (O’cass and Grace 2003). When people who represent the organization lose
their tempers, get tired and anxious, and sometimes have just had enough that day,
experience with a service brand is therefore diﬀerent.
2.1
People as Brand
People were the ﬁrst brands; faces were the ﬁrst logos (Malone 2010). The way humans
respond to brands could be seen as an extension of how they instinctively perceive or
behave towards one another.
In the case that the person representing the brand doesn’t perform properly, the rela‐
tionship between the brand and the customer may collapse. The implication of this is
that service-based companies have to focus on their internal employees to a greater
extent than product-based companies.
2.2
Service Brand as a Relationship Partner
As conventional concepts of brand is refer to customer attitude, satisfaction, loyalty, and
brand personality (Fournier 1994). The rising of service industry extends the under‐
standing of brand dynamics. Service brand, as contributing-relationship partner of the
consumers could be considered in a relationship dyad.
Designers, especially service designers, attempt to humanize and anthropomorphize
brands. In this case, Yangshan local brands are described in media ads as having warm‐
hearted and positive personalities. However, a relationship in a person-to-person sense
takes these perceptions a step further in that a relationship requires interaction and results
in qualiﬁed statements about how the other person’s personality interacts with our own.
754
Y. Liang et al.

Blackston (1992, 2000) conceptualizes the brand as a person with whom the consumer
may choose to have a relationship. For service brand, it means which social network
customers hope to build and which lifestyle they want to have.

Brand Equity from Product to Service
As what has been introduced in the previous sections of this paper, Yangshan Peach has
been trying to develop several methods to access larger market potentials. The peach
company historically worked on the products with local specialty subjecting to the mode
of traditional agriculture industry, which made them as mass production supplier for
retail sites mainly within regional market. While during the recent years the company
has been making continuous eﬀorts enhancing its market performance through trans‐
formation from traditional agriculture strategies to a more integrated scale, that is,
branding level, or in another word, through the transformation from a product brand to
a service brand. The eﬀorts include redesign for visual presentations (e.g. logo and
package, etc.), adjustment of pricing strategies (raise the price for high-quality and
limited products), extension of product lines (postcards, souvenirs, etc.), and even
development to tourism industry (agri-tainment activities e.g. Happy Farmhouse), which
all target to provide stronger brand experience for sense of uniqueness and distinctive
quality.
Such strategic transformation the company practice for its market development from
product-focused to service-focused indicate an urgent need for enhancement of its brand
equity through strategic branding design catering its special strengths. Brand equity from
the marketing arena refers to a concept focusing on the relationship between the brand
and its customers, which has been deﬁned and interpreted by various scholars with
diﬀerent approaches. Feldwick (1996) tried to simplify it as a total value of a brand as
a separable asset resulted from the attachment between brand and consumers. Aaker
raised discussion (Aaker 1992) on the importance of brand equity signiﬁcantly creating
Fig. 3. Asker’s brand equity 10
Transforming Branding Strategies from Product to Service
755

value to both the brand and its customers, and later in his book Managing Brand Equity
(Aaker 2009) summarizes a Brand Equity 10 model (Fig. 3) which indicates ﬁve dimen‐
sions that drive the understanding as well as strategies for brand equity enhancement.
All the dimensions direct to the end of strengthening brand-consumer relationship,
which can be formed from the holistic experience the brand oﬀer to the consumers. This
hence is able to provide theoretical rationale for the strategic branding design for Yang‐
shan Peach, which interpret its brand pursuit as to enhance the brand equity by reaching
better brand-consumer relationship through experience building.
3.1
Experience Matters—Peach, Not Only a Product for Eat, a Case of EATALY
Holbrook and Hirschman (1982) originally suggested the vital impact on consumption
practice that involves consumers’ participation with feelings of fun and fantasy engaging
both environmental and self-input from consumers’ experiential point of view. Extended
from this issue, later scholars explored types of models addressing the importance of
customer experience in diﬀerent academic ﬁelds. Schmitt’s studies on experiential
marketing speciﬁcally reveal strong insights for marketing and communication strat‐
egies regarding on eﬀectively staging holistic brand-consumer experience encountering
not only sensory and emotional responses but also engaging critical, behavioral and
social practices (Schmitt 1999). At this point, the case of EATALY illustrates an inclu‐
sive example for Yangshan Peach when dealing with the issue on how to transform the
food concept from product of traditional agricultural industry into an integrative service
level of experience through multiple channels.
EATALY is the world largest Italian marketplace concentrating on all food-concept-
related products and activities including not only retail of products like food and
beverage but also services like dining and cooking school. It was found in 2003 in Turin,
and now has developed worldwide points of sales including New York City, Istanbul,
San Paulo, and Tokyo, etc. As what is stated in their oﬃcial description, their target is
to promote “eating Italian food, living the Italian way”, which has been fully indicated
by its name linguistically. Therefore, being diﬀerent from the traditional food market‐
places, what EATALY sells are no longer the tangible food products from Italy only,
but also intangible service experience of the particular culture and lifestyle of Italy, to
the global consumers. With holding this mission, EATALY provides extensive product
categories from traditional Italian agricultural products to lifestyle products (e.g.
cooking instruments, coﬀee machines, kitchen accessories, etc.) and even magazines
and books which perform cultural education functions. For example, the books and
round maps teaching audience the Italian food and agricultural culture by seasons and
regions, etc. (Figs. 4 and 5). Apart from the extensive merchandise assortments,
EATALY promotes the Italian atmosphere by oﬀering several dining options and also
cooking classes within the same marketplace, which provides service platforms to facil‐
itate the social practice of communication toward lifestyle factors between the brand
and its customers, between customers and customers, between culture and cultures.
Moreover, being collaborated with Slow Food Association, such an integration of both
tangible and intangible experiential interfaces also bound together to co-create the
philosophy and value with its customers regarding the issue of “sustainability,
756
Y. Liang et al.

responsibility, and sharing” through consumption practice. Hence, this integrative
strategy practically interpret Schmitt’s model (2000) of experiential marketing in dimen‐
sions of sense, feel, think, act, and relate with deep degree of brand-consumer adhesion,
which eﬀectively fulﬁlls the power of brand equity engine. This case thereby discloses
brighter possibilities of insights for Yangshan Peach to strategically transform itself
from a product brand to a service brand by providing holistic channels for brand-
consumer experience, especially when combining its existing strengths when consid‐
ering the cultural tourism factors introduced in previous parts.

3.2
Brand Community Building—Peach, Not Only a Concept About Eat
The strategies for brand innovation by enhancing brand-consumer experience discussed
above suggested a possible pathway to construct the contact between the brand and its
customers from both tangible and intangible interfaces especially within the marketplace.
Apart from such direct strategies, the brand-consumer relationship should also be nurtured
from indirect channels. Brand community then no doubtfully serves this function that
leverage the brand equity by strengthen the attachment between the brand and the
consumers. Studies have driven abundant focus on how the customer-centric brand
community building exercises large positive impact on brand loyalty, brand awareness, and
brand association, etc. (McAlexander et al. 2002, 2003; Jang et al. 2008; Schau et al. 2009).
The concept demonstrates a set of social relationship structured by shared consciousness,
values, identities, ritual and traditions, co-created by both the brand and its customers,
which equips the brand asset emotionally and socially (Muniz and O’Guinn 2001).
In terms of branding for food, Wright et al. (2006) started to look from the inﬂuence
of virtual brand community building by the study of “my Nutella The Community”
project, which shows the empowerment of consumers by cultivating themselves to
express their relationship with Nutella narrating their personal stories for the goal of
self-expression for its emotional attachment to the brand. In this case, each consumer

757

as participant passionately shares his/her subjective experience toward the brand that is
regarded as his/her extended self, and the brand community then becomes the pool feasts
individualism through the virtual campaign. Compared to this case, more classical cases
that have been discussed by years of brand community studies are from vehicle brands
such as Harley Davison, Mini, Mercedes, etc., which strategically formed not only
virtual communities but also member clubs integrating both on-line and oﬀ-line activ‐
ities, both products and services exclusively for the members. For example, H.O.G club
of Harley Davison in diﬀerent countries organize various types of riding activities
catering for consumers’ diversities, during which the enhancement of brand-consumer
relationship is experientially tighten up, meanwhile it also oﬀers platforms for
consumers and relative parties socializing with one another. Therefore, the brand and
the experience are symbolized by social meanings which connect self with product, self
with self, self with group, and group with group, for pursuance of individualism and
belongingness, commonness and distinction. Combining the experiential strategies
suggested in the previous part of the paper, Wuxi Yangshan Peach has the potential to
develop membership program by providing series of experience-oriented activities
communicating local culture, educating innovative agricultural philosophy, and
promoting particular leisure lifestyle toward its target consumers, by which the
community is built up to strengthen the brand-consumer relationship so as to enhance
the brand equity with sustainable concern.

Brand Engagement for Service
Service brands elevate themselves by injecting a service element into their DNA to create
a richer and more multi-dimensional brand experience. Yangshan create new channels
for customer service including both online and oﬄine. First they cooperate with Tujia
which is an online tourism service system to build up a plant form sharing user experi‐
ence and publishing news. Then, to enhance customer engagement, self-service tourism
will be supported by local companies. In this case, Yangshan brand act as an umbrella
for the whole service system, enabling eﬃcient marketing with brand in a solution-
driven way. This is then a more customer-centered process instead of putting focus too
much on the brand itself.
4.1
Customer Engagement in Service
In service process, customer engagement exists in a full spectrum of experiences. It is
no longer a series of one-oﬀ experiences—it is an ongoing dialogue. One aspect of this
spectrum is the relationships that customers form with each other. The peer-to-peer
relationships are core to the social web. As the rapid development of internet, customers
will not just be interacting with companies, they will talk amongst themselves, sharing
their perspectives across. For this, Yangshan cooperated with many internet enterprises
to build up a huge information platform.
758
Y. Liang et al.

4.2
Real Brand Engagement
Through serious of interactive activities in Yangshan, customers get multiple experience
in a well-designed customer journey.
With awareness a given, service providers will link “engagement” to how well the
brand is perceived versus their category’s ideal, rather than just counting “likes” or
leveraging imagery. Hosts of Happy Farmhouse is core member of service system who
receive feedback from both customers and providers so that they are able to evaluate
the customer experience through multiple aspects.
4.3
Brand as Mutually Beneﬁcial Relationship
Yanshan try to build up a well-developed friendship based on interdependent needs and
mutual respects. This friendship is a two-way street. On one hand, during the online
platform and co-design process, customers feel heard, and they can see their role in
Yangshan as a social actors. At the same time, Yangshan get feedback, and have the
opportunity to improve their business, thereby by attracting more customers.

Conclusion
Branding strategies for service-focused brand is quite diﬀerent from traditional
branding. User experience is vital and branding could be anytime and anywhere. As a
designer, we should stay in the forefront of customers’ minds and analyze all the stake‐
holders in a big map with service design tools.
With service brands, customers have a wider lens to access multiple oﬀerings. As
they take all stakeholders into consideration, it’s necessary to sharp brand image for
designers.
Brand Engagement and brand equity is the vital factors in this process. Service design
methodology can help designers to get insights of stakeholders and ﬁnd the opportunities
through the studies on brand-consumer relationship.

Abstract. In recent years, implementing mobile IT management and applica-
tion are important organizational development strategies for international
enterprises. This study aims to explore the insurance salesperson’s usage
behavior of mobile technology and their attitude toward using mobile technol-
ogy in workplace by the case study method. A total of 72 valid questionnaires
were collected from local employees of an insurance company in Taiwan. The
results showed: (1) Smartphones were more often used to support instant
communication tasks and read individual’s learning resources and (2) were
viewed as more helpful to support most tasks than tablets besides reading ofﬁcial
learning resources. (3) Using mobile devices in workplace were regarded to
improve information communication, images and individual’s workﬂow efﬁ-
ciency. The ﬁndings provided information for companies’ managers to design a
more productive mobile workplace especially for sales departments that have
high mobility employees.

Introduction
In recent years, implementing mobile IT management and application have been an
important organizational development strategy for international enterprises [1]. As
reported in Accenture’s 2014 mobility survey, companies were moving aggressively to
adopt mobile technologies and are developing formal strategies [2]. According to
iThome’s 2015 annual CIO survey, the insurance industry had the highest willingness
to implement mobile technology in workplace among other industries in Taiwan [3].
This survey also showed that sales departments often adopted mobile technologies
earlier than the other divisions in insurance industry.
Many reports and researches has veriﬁed the beneﬁts of implementing mobile
technology in the workplace. Accenture [2] showed that more than 45 % senior
decision-makers for digital strategy and technologies in companies considered that
implementing multiple mobile technologies in workplace could create revenue
opportunities, increase product/service development speed and customer engagement,

and also enable rapid responses to customer demands [4]. Mobile technology not only
provided the anytime anywhere learning environment to enhance employees’ work
capability but also facilitated immediate service to clients and ﬁnally made company
get rid of the existing energy-intensive business environment, to create a low-carbon
economy [5–7]. Yueh et al. [8] found that using smartphone on work tasks had a
positive impact on individual perceived work performance.
The most revenue in an insurance company is from sales departments. The sales-
person should provide efﬁcient service to clients anytime and anywhere to increase
individual performance and companies’ revenue. Their work is of high mobility and
need instant information. As mentioned previously, the advantages of mobile tech-
nology support the salesperson’s work tasks and improve the workﬂow. When orga-
nizational managers target the speciﬁc individual requirements depending on job roles
and tasks, a better ﬁt between the type of mobile technology and job demands is likely
to increase productivity [9]. Motivated by the aforementioned phenomenon, this study
aims to explore the insurance salesperson’s usage behavior of mobile technology and
their attitude toward using mobile technology in workplace. In doing so, this study
provides two main contributions. First, it deliver information for companies’ managers
to design a more productive mobile workplace especially for sales departments which
have high mobility employees. Second, the results shed light on the relevance issue of
mobile workplace research.

Methods
This study adopted the survey method to collect empirical data from the employees in a
regional business establishment of a leading insurance company in Taiwan, which has
implemented mobile technology of iPad to support the salesperson’s work tasks from
2012. All participants are from the sales department. A total of 72 valid questionnaires
were collected from local employees using paper questionnaires.
This study investigated participants’ demographic information, attitude toward
advantages and applications of mobile technology measured by a 6-point Likert scale,
anchored by 1 (strongly disagree) and 6 (strongly agree). The questionnaire also
inquired participants’ actual mobile technology using experiences measured by a
5-point Likert scale. The using experiences survey investigated users’ using frequency
(0 = never use, 4 = always use) and perceived usefulness (0 = unhelpful, 4 = very
helpful) of various tasks (i.e. making a phone call, using e-mail, checking personal
schedule and browsing web pages editing ﬁles) in works.
For data analysis, descriptive statistical analysis was applied to report the overall
status. In addition, paired-samples T test and Cohen’s d effect size was used to analyze
the difference using experience between smartphones and tablets.

Demographics and the Using Experiences of Mobiles
The samples were composed of 80.3 % females and 19.7 % males, and nearly 70 %
samples’ age were above 35. Above 65 % of participants have worked in this com-
panies more than ﬁve years (46, 65.7 %). Over 90 % of the participants (67, 96 %)
held high school diplomas and 42 % of the participants (29, 42 %) held bachelor
degrees.
Almost all participants have smartphones (70, 97 %). The proportion of operating
system run on smartphones is iOS:Android = 1:3.5. Compared to the possession rate of
smartphone, 81.9 % of the participants have tablets, and more than half of them use iPads.
Most employees responded they have adopted mobiles over 1 years (51, 77.1 %) and
used them more than twice a day (50, 71.4 %). The respondents considered mobile
devices were easy to use (M = 5.01, SD = 1.014). Most of the employees bought their
own mobiles personally (28, 45.2 %) or obtained discount to buy mobiles from the
company rather (27, 43.5 %) than got allotment of mobiles from the company (5, 8.1 %).
Table 1 shows the using frequency rating of smartphones for different work tasks
by the participants in this study. When participants responded the using frequency of
smartphones for a task was more than 0, their perceived usefulness of smartphones for
the tasks could be analyzed (Table 2). As can be seen in Table 1, participants regarded
ﬁve tasks – make a phone call, browse web pages, use e-mail and manage individual’s
schedule– were more usually supported by smartphones (mean > 2.5). Table 2 shows
smartphones were useful to support work tasks (mean > 2.5). Participants considered
most tasks – make a phone call, use e-mail, browse web pages, read ofﬁcial learning
resources, manage individual’s schedule, ﬁnish work tasks and read individual learning
resources–especially could be efﬁciently supported by smartphones (mean > 3).
Table 3 reports the using frequency rating of tablets for various work tasks by the
participants in this study. Table 3 shows the main task supported by tablets is browsing

The More Efﬁcient Mobile Technology to Support Various Work
Tasks
To verify which mobile device is regarded as more efﬁcient to support different work
tasks, this study analyzed using frequency and perceived usefulness of smartphones
and tablets for work tasks by T-test for paired samples and Cohen’s d. All variables
were below the guidelines for skewness and kurtosis (<3 and <10, respectively) rec-
ommended by Kline [10]. The participants who both used smartphones and tablets to
support a task were analyzed (the using frequency is more than 0).
Table 5 shows the paired t-tests result for using frequency of smartphones and
tablets for work tasks. As can be seen in Table 5, using frequency of smartphones for
three tasks – make a phone call (M = 3.48, p < 0.001), manage individual’s schedule
(M = 2.89, p < 0.05) and read individual learning resources (M = 2.73, p < 0.05) – are
signiﬁcant higher than tablets with an effect size of d = 0.627, 0.326 and 0.332
respectively. Table 6 reports the paired t-tests result for perceived usefulness of
smartphones and tablets for work tasks. According to the results in Table 6, perceived
usefulness of smartphones for four tasks – make a phone call (M = 3.50, p < 0.001),
manage individual’s schedule (M = 3.08, p < 0.001), read individual learning
resources (M = 3.50, p < 0.001) and ﬁnish work tasks – are signiﬁcant more useful
than tablets with an effect size of d = 0.578, 0.480, 0.463 and 0.578 respectively.
Although perceived usefulness of smartphones for three tasks – use e-mail (M = 3.47,
p = 0.654, d = 0.256), edit ﬁles (M = 3.41, p = 0.096, d = 0.224) and take notes
(M = 3.10, p = 0.107, d = 0.223) – are not signiﬁcant more useful than tablets on the p
values, their effect size of d shows smartphones are a little more useful for supporting
these three tasks than tablets.

workplace has positive inﬂuences. Using mobile devices in workplace not only can
support the communication among colleagues (M = 5.10, SD = 0.981), the company
(M = 5.08, SD = 1.003) and clients (M = 5.01, SD = 1.068), but also enhance the
company (M = 5.00, SD = 0.890) or individuals’ professional image (M = 4.94,

Discussion
The participants of this study were senior sales in the insurance company and have
substantial experience of using mobile devices. They generally perceived mobile
devices as highly easy to use and regarded using mobile devices in workplace can
improve information communication, images and individual’s workﬂow.
The results of descriptive statistics shows the using frequency and perceived use-
fulness of smartphone for work tasks both are generally higher than tablets generally.
Only the perceived usefulness of tablets for reading ofﬁcial learning resources is higher
than smartphones. The results of T-test and effect size of d reports that the participants
signiﬁcantly more often used smartphones to support instant communication tasks and
read individual’s learning resources and considered smartphones are more helpful to
support most tasks besides reading ofﬁcial learning resources.
According to these ﬁndings, this study proposes that smartphones have higher
mobility and more functions to support instant communicating and creating and
managing individual’s work information than tablets in workplace. The screen size of
smartphones become bigger than bigger but still smaller than tablets, so when the
applications are more various and accessible, smartphones’ mobility could be more
helpful for supporting sales’ work tasks.
This study is a pilot study to explore sales’ mobile technology using behavior in
workplace. Future studies should increase the sample size and compare the mobile
technology using behavior between the ﬁeld and indoor jobs to propose more speciﬁc
suggestions for a high productive mobile workplace design.

Cross-Cultural Conﬂict Management in Taiwan-Funded
Enterprises in Mainland China

Abstract. As the quantity of Taiwan-funded enterprises investing in mainland
China keeps increasing, management problems caused by cultural diﬀerences
between the mainland and Taiwan have drawn attention from both academic and
business circles. Though they are of the same origin, Taiwan culture and mainland
culture have formed their individual characteristics due to diﬀerent social evolu‐
tion for more than a century. In this study based on Hofstede’s Culture Measure‐
ment Model, cultural conﬂicts in Taiwan-funded enterprises in mainland China
are systematically analyzed from the three levels of values, institution and
management behavior through the interview analysis of three Taiwan-funded
enterprises. Starting with the strategy of collaborating in conﬂict management,
speciﬁc and constructive solutions to the problems mentioned above are proposed
accordingly.
With the deepening of cross-Strait relations, numerous Taiwan companies
invest in mainland China. They face cultural conﬂicts brought by cultural diﬀer‐
ences between the mainland and Taiwan when Taiwan-funded enterprises copy
Taiwan management mode to mainland China. This problem has a signiﬁcant
impact on company development. Diﬀerence in values between people in the
mainland and Taiwan caused by diﬀerent histories, social patterns and economic
systems will necessarily provoke cultural conﬂicts. Cultural conﬂicts damage the
harmonious relationships between the management and staﬀ, weaken team cohe‐
siveness, and are not in the interest of global strategy implementation by Taiwan-
funded enterprises. It is an important topic of conﬂict management how to
understand cross-Strait cultural diﬀerences, to solve cultural conﬂicts in Taiwan-
funded enterprises, and to help enterprises gain sustainable competitiveness.

Cross-Cultural Conﬂicts
Conﬂicts are everywhere. Conﬂicts will be provoked when individuals in an organiza‐
tion have disputes in such aspects as objectives, emotion and interest (Bendersky and
Hays 2012). Cross-cultural conﬂicts refer to disputes caused by cultural diﬀerences
(Jassawalla et al. 2004).
The cultural model built by Hofstede (1984) has been widely applied in research
on cross-cultural management. Hofstede divided culture measurement into three levels.

(1) The Values Level: It consists of three dimensions, namely personal ideology, work
attitude and demand for power; (2) The Institution Level: It refers to the human
resources management mechanism; (3) The Management Behavior Level: It refers to
the behavior guidance of the management. Based on Hofstede’s Culture Measurement
Model, cultural conﬂicts in the operation of Taiwan-funded enterprises in mainland
China are discussed in this paper respectively from the three levels of values, institution
and management behavior.
The ﬁve strategies of conﬂict management are respectively: (1) Competing, in which
one side wins and the other loses; (2) Avoiding, in which both conﬂicting parties put
oﬀ conﬂict indeﬁnitely; (3) Compromising, in which the conﬂicting parties give up
elements of their position in order to establish an acceptable solution; (4) Accommo‐
dating, in which one side meets the demand of the opposing side at the expense of their
own interests; (5) Collaborating, in which both parties work together to ﬁnd a win-win
solution (Rahim 1983; Thomas 1992). Existing studies show that the strategy of collab‐
orating in conﬂict management not only eﬀectively buﬀers conﬂicts but also maximizes
advantages of both parties to achieve satisfactory results (Rahim 2002).

Research Methods
In this paper, with three Taiwan-funded enterprises in Beijing as research objects, an in-
depth discussion is made on cultural conﬂicts in the operation of Taiwan-funded enter‐
prises in mainland China. We interviewed 56 people in total, among whom there were
6 senior managers, 15 middle managers, 16 junior managers and 19 employees. Inter‐
views were conducted separately to dispel the concerns of interviewees. The average
interview time was 20 min per person. All interviews were conducted with the semi-
structured interviewing technique. The interview outline was prepared according to the
three levels in Hofstede’s Culture Measurement Model. Additional questions could be
asked on a case-by-case basis to gain insight into the status of corporate cultural conﬂicts.
Some interviews were recorded with the permission of the interviewees.
Four Ph.D. students processed the interview transcription and encoded the tran‐
scription in two groups according to the following criteria: (1) Sentences were classiﬁed
in accordance with the three levels in Hofstede’s Culture Measurement Model;
(2) Sentence description must be clear and deﬁnite; (3) Original sentences were used as
far as possible; (4) Each code was meaningful. After coding, two groups of Ph.D.
students discussed and modiﬁed their coding results until they reached agreement under
the guidance of a lecturer.

Analysis of Cultural Conﬂicts in Taiwan-Funded Enterprises
3.1
The Values Level
Personal Ideology. It is found in the interviews that managers and employees in
Taiwan-funded enterprises, who have a strong sense of organization, generally consider
the overall interests of the organization. Most of them are ready to sacriﬁce private
770
L. Ma et al.

interests for public aﬀairs. Employees from Taiwan have a stronger sense of belonging
to their companies and are willing to grow with their companies. Interviewees said
employees from Taiwan generally had a stronger sense of belonging than their mainland
counterparts though young employees of the new age showed a much weaker sense of
belonging than before in recent years.
Compared with their Taiwan counterparts, mainland employees tended to change
their jobs and places of residence more frequently. Besides, they generally did not
maintain stable and long-term relationships with their colleagues. Most mainland
employees chose to leave for a better job if there was a company oﬀering a better salary
and beneﬁts. Interviewees also said that after accumulating certain working experience
and interpersonal connections, some employees resigned immediately and started homo‐
geneous companies to compete with their former companies.
Attitude at Work. In Taiwan-funded enterprises, compared with their Taiwan collea‐
gues, mainland employees are more willing to accept risky and challenging tasks. Main‐
land employees generally regard the challenges as good opportunities to fully show their
work ability and talent. Only by ﬁrmly seizing these opportunities can their strengths
and talents be recognized by colleagues and managers. However, Taiwan managers are
comparatively conservative and are not willing to accept high-risk tasks or jobs. They
are generally worried that uncertain risks will inﬂuence their positions. This is closely
related to the inﬂuence of long-term colonization on Taiwan, which results in that people
generally lack the sense of security. They are often reluctant to undertake tasks beyond
their normal scope of work and would like to reduce the risks in ﬁnishing the tasks.
Power Distance. Mainland subordinates have a relatively weaker perception of power
distance to their superiors, especially the young generation born after 1980, who have
higher education backgrounds and rich knowledge, and are profoundly inﬂuenced by
foreign cultures (especially western cultures), thus advocating freedom and equality.
They have insightful views and opinions regarding problem solving and do not accept
the absolute authority of their superiors. They often actively raise their doubts and opin‐
ions if they think the solutions of their superiors are to be improved. Employees from
Taiwan, however, have a stronger perception of power distance. According to the ster‐
eotyped ideology in their minds, diﬀerences in social wealth and power have been insti‐
tutionalized and legalized. There is a strict hierarchy between superiors and subordinates
in an enterprise. In communication, ranks are emphasized and people with diﬀerent ranks
stay away from each other. A superior would like his subordinates to accept his ideas
and act according to his way of thinking. He seldom takes the doubts and suggestions
of his subordinates but regards them as disrespect to him.
3.2
The Institution Level
Human Resources Planning. HRP (Human Resources Planning) focuses on the anal‐
ysis of future human resources supply and demand, according to which recruitment and
training plans are prepared. HRP is drafted in all of the interviewed Taiwan-funded
enterprises. According to the interviews, Taiwan-funded enterprises paid more attention
Cross-Cultural Conﬂict Management in Taiwan
771

to short-term HRP due to the lack of knowledge about mainland labor laws and regu‐
lations. As the market environment changes, long-term HRP is generally not executed
though prepared.
Recruitment and Selection. The HR managers from the interviewed companies all
complained that it was diﬃcult to recruit talents in mainland China. It is mainly because
of comparatively less attractive salaries and beneﬁts as well as limited career develop‐
ment prospects. Taiwan-funded enterprises attach great importance to work attitude.
Employees from Taiwan are also highly loyal and dedicated. This phenomenon is
popular in Taiwan-funded enterprises. The relationship between a mainland employee
and his company is, however, more like a contractual relationship, i.e. “I work as much
as I am paid”. A mainland employee usually resigns if the salary given by his company
fails to meet his expectations. That’s also why mainland employees recruited by Taiwan-
funded enterprises often resign after they are mature, though these enterprises invest a
lot to train them in the preliminary stage. Taiwan-funded enterprises widely complain
that they cannot retain talents as employees are not loyal enough. Mainland employees,
however, complain that Taiwan-funded enterprises oﬀer low salaries but tiring jobs.
This phenomenon is mainly caused by cultural diﬀerences between the two sides.
Salary and Incentive Systems. Taiwan-funded enterprises generally oﬀer much lower
salaries than US and European enterprises. As the interviews shows, it is because
Taiwan-funded enterprises pay much attention to the training of employees who can
share a common fate with them. Therefore, they tend to recruit new college graduates
and spend much money on staﬀ training. This type of corporate culture, though it is the
values of Taiwan-funded enterprises, can hardly integrate with mainland employees nor
attract or retain outstanding employees. On the other hand, the interviewed companies
pay salaries to mainland employees according to the local wage level, but to employees
from Taiwan according to the Taiwan wage level which is generally much higher than
the former. Mainland employees, thus, ﬁnd the salary system unfair. In addition, the
large wage gap between Taiwan managers and ordinary employees also dissatisﬁes
mainland employees. Mainlanders generally canonize economic egalitarianism but
disapprove a large wage gap between managers and ordinary employees. This is closely
related to the years of “Communal Pot” system. Therefore, the large wage gap between
superiors and subordinates, to some extent, hits the morale of subordinates and is not in
the interest of smooth and eﬀective work.
Training. Besides skills training, Taiwan-funded enterprises also provide mainland
employees with training on working habits, behavior and attitude and so on. As the
interviews show, though mainland and Taiwan are from the same root, mainland
employees may misunderstand their Taiwan managers due to cultural and conceptual
diﬀerences because languages, customs and habits around mainland China, which has
a vast territory, are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
Career Development. In the interviewed companies, 100 % of the senior managers are
from Taiwan and only about 30 % of the middle managers are mainlanders. The CEOs
of the three companies all said that they would rather appoint Taiwan managers. On one
772
L. Ma et al.

hand, it is related to the quality of mainland employees. On the other hand, they cannot
promote too many mainland employees considering the mentality of employees from
Taiwan. This not only hits the morale of mainland employees, but also makes Taiwan-
funded enterprises less attractive to outstanding mainland talents.
3.3
The Management Behavior Level
Centralization. From the interviews, it can be seen that Taiwan-funded enterprises
attach great importance to qualiﬁcations and social status. In the interviewed companies,
managers and ordinary employees have meals in separate areas. It reﬂects the corporate
culture that values qualiﬁcations and social status. Many employees from Taiwan regard
this treatment as a symbol of status. In Taiwan-funded enterprises, signiﬁcant authority
is granted to managers. Compared with mainland employees, Taiwan managers have a
stronger concept of centralization. Subordinates must absolutely follow the decisions of
their superiors even when they know these decisions are wrong.
The ferocious and stern attitude of quite a few Taiwan managers has been formed
in their long period of rigid labor management in Taiwan. Most incumbents (male) in
Taiwan enterprises and public institutions have served in the army and experienced
military life. Current Taiwan-funded enterprises still retain a distinct hierarchical patri‐
archal culture as military life features result-orientation, hierarchy and the obedience of
superior orders. Mainland employees, however, may regard it as an insult to their char‐
acters or an infringement of their rights since they have been taught that “All men are
created equal” for a long time.
Institutionalization. All the interviewed companies emphasized that it was important
to impose severe company rules and regulations. Employees are regulated by discipline
and will be severely punished if they make mistakes. Nobody can escape his responsi‐
bility for any excuse. According to the interviewed companies, various rules and regu‐
lations made by a company are not for the convenience of managers but used to regulate
employee behavior and to facilitate the healthy development of the company. They
disapproved the governance of a company in the “Tender Management” method. If an
employee did not receive due punishment after making a mistake, managers would fall
into an extremely passive state when similar events happened again. Mainland
employees, however, generally focus on feelings and interpersonal relationships and
ﬁnd Taiwan-funded enterprises impersonal. On the contrary, employees from Taiwan
think that mainland employees are too ﬂexible and unprincipled facing the regulations.
4
Collaborating in Conﬂict Management
It is especially important to handle them with the strategy of collaborating in conﬂict
management after the cultural conﬂicts in Taiwan-funded enterprises in mainland China
are identiﬁed. A brand-new organizational culture that integrates both cultures can be
formed only when two diﬀerent cultures admit and value their diﬀerences and respect,
supplement and coordinate with each other. This uniﬁed culture is not only highly stable
Cross-Cultural Conﬂict Management in Taiwan
773

but also has the advantage of “hybridization”. It is, therefore, the optimal choice for
Taiwan-funded enterprises in mainland China to reduce cultural barrier cost and to
improve economic eﬃciency by absorbing the essence of diﬀerent cultures through
collaborating and forming a unique corporate culture and management style.
4.1
Enhancing Communication at the Values Level
According to the analysis above, there are large gaps between mainland and Taiwan
employees in terms of ideology, attitude and power cognition at the values level.
Conﬂicts happen if they fail to understand and communicate with each other properly.
Taiwan-funded enterprises, therefore, should usually organize various activities and
guide employees of diﬀerent cultural backgrounds to positively and actively integrate
themselves into the local living and cultural environment through formal and informal
parties. They should also create conditions for the two employee groups’ to understand
each other’s cultural backgrounds, values and expressions, so as to improve interper‐
sonal relationships, strengthen communication and remove prejudice, and to create an
atmosphere of mutual trust, sincere cooperation and open communication. Especially,
senior managers should enhance their interaction with mainland employees to improve
their aﬃnity; encourage employees to make suggestions so as to absorb all useful ideas;
build consensus and good working relationships among employees with the idea of
solving problems, to correct the imperfections of paternalistic leadership. Many scholars
have pointed out that trust accumulates when regular communication and timely feed‐
back increase. Taiwan businessmen, therefore, must build a mutual-trust relationship
between Taiwan and mainland employees through such open communication.
4.2
Strengthening Cultural Training at the Institution Level
According to the interview results, cultural conﬂicts at the institution level in Taiwan-
funded enterprises in mainland China mainly lie in the following four aspects: environ‐
mental policy, employee competency, salaries and staﬀ promotion. Training is the most
eﬀective way to solve these cultural conﬂicts. First of all, strengthen timely training of
senior managers on mainland environmental policy to help managers seize opportunities
and make correct decisions. Second, especially strengthen the training of employees’
sense of belonging and cohesiveness to help mainland employees realize the long-term
investment of their companies in their personal development and to improve staﬀ
loyalty. Third, continue strengthening staﬀ cultivation and personal ability trainings to
help mainland employees grow. Fourth, organize training of team awareness for all the
staﬀ. It is because they regard each other as out-group members that so many inharmo‐
nious and unpleasant cases occur between Taiwan employee teams and mainland
employee teams. It is, thus, necessary to increase the contact between the two groups
and to actively create opportunities for all to interact with each other with ease after
work. As they understand each other better, previous prejudices will fade away gradu‐
ally. Last, train a large pool of outstanding talents with cross-cultural management ability
by seizing the opportunity of cross-cultural training. They are aware of mainland China’s
actual conditions and skilled at communication with subordinates, trust and support their
774
L. Ma et al.

subordinates, and have rich professional knowledge, personality charm and strong
managerial ability. The rapid and stable development of a company depends on these
highly qualiﬁed managers.
4.3
Improving Localization at the Management Behavior Level
Cultural conﬂicts at the management behavior level are particularly reﬂected in the
totalitarian thoughts of Taiwan managers and institutional control. The localization of
managers is an eﬀective solution to these conﬂicts. Taiwan-funded enterprises must
enhance the training and appointment of mainland managers, especially senior and
middle managers. Mainland managers who know mainland cultural traditions and way
of thinking can communicate and work collaboratively with their subordinates, regulate
employees’ behavior and improve employees’ capability and quality. Besides, mainland
managers, most of whom have a higher education background, can realize eﬃcient
management of a company as they have a profound understanding of western manage‐
ment methods and can understand and implement management ideas of their Taiwan
bosses well. Overall expenses on expatriate managers, therefore, will be reduced and
the working enthusiasm of mainland employees will also be raised.
Staﬀ localization is an optimal solution to cross-cultural management conﬂicts. The
following two measures must be taken to realize staﬀ localization. On one hand, “No
Ceiling” policy should be implemented for the promotion of local talents. A company
with human-based management shall never allow the existence of regional, racial,
gender or age discrimination in human resources management. Only when there is
enough development space can Taiwan-funded enterprises attract high-caliber and
outstanding local talents. On the other hand, the policy of “equal pay for equal work”
should be applied to local talents. Only when local talents are treated equally without
discrimination can the sense of belonging of local staﬀ be strengthened and can excellent
employees be retained.
5
Conclusion and Discussion
Taiwan-funded enterprises, as an important component of the pluralistic economy of
mainland China, have made outstanding contributions to the economic development of
mainland China. It is of important practical signiﬁcance to analyze the cross-cultural
conﬂicts in the actual management process in Taiwan-funded enterprises, to ﬁnd out the
reasons and seek solutions, and to help Taiwan-funded enterprises establish their
management modes in the mainland cultural environment.
In this paper, cultural conﬂicts in Taiwan-funded enterprises in mainland China are
discussed respectively at the three levels of values, institution and management behavior
through ﬁeld research, interviews and literature analysis. In conclusion, there are four
types of cultural conﬂicts: staﬀ loyalty, salary system, centralized management style and
localization of managers. Due to problems such as strict hierarchy, paternalistic manage‐
ment mechanism, unreasonable salary system and “Glass Roof” for mainland
employees, Taiwan-funded enterprises become less attractive in staﬀ recruitment with
Cross-Cultural Conﬂict Management in Taiwan
775

an increasing churn rate of mainland employees and the complaints of Taiwan managers
about the low loyalty and dedication of mainland employees.
Based on the strategy of collaborating in conﬂict management, this research identi‐
ﬁes the correct solution to cross-cultural conﬂicts in Taiwan-funded enterprises. First of
all, managers of Taiwan-funded enterprises should build a mutual-trust relationship
between mainland and Taiwan employees by usually creating various opportunities for
open communication between them. Second, Taiwan-funded enterprises should pay
attention to cross-cultural training to improve the cross-cultural communication ability,
team awareness and competence. Besides, they should also train a pool of outstanding
talents with cross-cultural management ability. Third, Taiwan-funded enterprises should
accelerate the localization of managers to strengthen the sense of belonging of local
staﬀ and to raise their working enthusiasm. Taiwan-funded enterprises should try to
build a uniﬁed vision, strengthen the construction of cohesion, and help themselves gain
competitive advantages through open and inclusive organizational cultures.

Abstract. Empathic design is an emerging issue in the ﬁeld of design, adopts
the human-oriented concept and emphasizes the position of the design object
and an in-depth understanding of the potential needs of users to design the
products, services and environment users really need. Designers may design
products that satisfy the needs of users by exercising empathy and an in-depth
understanding of the potential demands of users. Four designers of S brand were
aimed as the object of this study and an in-depth interview was made to
understand the thinking processes of designers. The thinking models of these
four designers were constructed respectively to explore the empathic design
process. This research methodology included the grounded theory, data and

Introduction
People emphasize the spiritual signiﬁcance of consumption and emotional resort in the
era of experience consumption. Consequently, the human factor is tremendously
focused during the design process such as human-centered design, user-centered design
and consumer-centered design. The main core issues are to realize the real demands of
consumers and to conﬁrm whether users are satisﬁed with the designed products and
services. Market surveys and focus groups and so on were the common methods to
collection consumer information on earlier days. Designers also conducted participant
design to explore consumer behaviors or observe in the lab. However, when people
were aware of being observed, their true colors would not be revealed causing the
difﬁculty in excavating the real problems. Designers need to develop empathy towards
users (to feel how the users feel) and understand the potential demands of users so as to

satisfy user requirements. As a result, methods of literature review, case study, in-depth
interviews and grounded theory are adopted in this research. Four designers of S brand
were aimed as the object of study and in-depth interviews were made to understand the
thinking processes of the designers. Thus, the thinking models of these four designers
were constructed and analyzed and the conceptual model of empathic design was
demonstrated by probing the process, analysis of the grounded theory, summarization
of literature reviews and comparison and analysis of studies.

Literature Review
1. User-centered Design: Norman took the psychological aspect for emotional design
recently and used the concepts of designers and users as examples to develop a
successful and identical psychological model commonly shared by designers and
users. The conceptual models of the designers and the users as shown in Fig. 1
communicate through products and products communicate the messages of sys-
tematic images. Norman and Draper (1986) proposed user-centered design
(UCD) and Norman (1988) deﬁned UCD as a philosophy in compliance with
demands and interests of users to produce a usable and understandable product.
It is critically important to know the expectations and needs of users prior to launching
a new product in particular. Thus, designers can’t just resort to their own experiences
and expertise to design similar products. More related information from consumers is
required. For instance, users can be invited to try new products and describe their ideas
and defects about such products as a reference for designers. Users are like
co-designers, which is unprecedented. We name such approach of data collection as
user-centered design currently. The most common questions include “What does the
user want?” “Why does the user want this?” and “What does the user expect?” etc.
2. Role Playing: Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO, mentioned the true experience of
Kristian Simsarian, a designer of IDEO, being a patient in an emergency room at a
seminar on serious play in 2008. Altay Sendil, another designer of IDEO, used to

have his hair on the chest removed and experience the moment when the dressing
patch was removed as the pains chronic patients felt. These experiences are role
playing, which is a powerful sensation that helps designers to think when designing.
In other words, designers experience the things they are about to design through
playing the roles (Brown 2008). After designers experience in person, they can
apply it to ﬁnd out the products, services and environment that suit users best.
3. Scenario-oriented Design Approach: Acer introduced scenario design from IDEO
in 1990, which was like the mind map of users. Scenarios or stories that are
transformed from rational data are the most touching. Designers explain events and
texture and integrate sense and sensibility via storytelling and scripts as well as
visualizing imagination through different scenarios so as to understand various
needs of the users (Yu et al. 2001). The process of script design is illustrated in
Fig. 2. Four steps of producing a script, including introduction, elucidation of the
theme, transition to another viewpoint and summing up are utilized to set up a story.
Designers then absorb the related information and convert it to a communication
tool so as to design the products, services and environment that meet demands of
the users.
4. User Experience (Prototypes): it is a term to test use and satisfaction of a product
and is usually used for software or marketing testing. Norman (1999) described it as
a process of product development that starts with users and their needs rather than
with technology. Kuniavsky (2003), one of the initiators of Adaptive Path, said in
his book Observing the User Experience that how to apply it extensively to more
user research techniques of high efﬁciency. Rubinoff (2004) considered user
experience was based on four elements, including brand, use, function and satis-
faction, which provided a key to success. Paluch (2006) mentioned on his website
that user experience was the description of a user about the feature of any product
when using it, which could extend to cars, cellphones, magazines or kids’ toys. The
Fig. 2. Process of script design (amended from Yu et al. 2001, P: 13)

signiﬁcance is how the user feels about the product or service and how to put it into
words. Reiss (2009) deﬁned user experience (UX) as a sum of a series of inter-
actions in his blog.

Methodology
In-depth interviews, design of question items, case study, analysis of the grounded
theory, an understanding of the problems related to empathic design and literature
review were conducted in this research. The design processes of four designers (two
designers and two senior designers) from the same brand were compared and analyzed.
The in-depth interviews were analyzed and summarized by the grounded theory to
develop the empathic design model (Fig. 3).
3.1
Method of Study
The deﬁnition of an in-depth interview made by Minichiello et al. was similar to that by
Taylor and Bogdan (1984). The research and the information provider encounter face
to face repeatedly so that the views expressed by the information provider about his/her
own way, life, experience or scenario can be understood (Minichiello et al. 1996). The
qualitative interview approach was adopted in this research and a semi-structured
interview was made with individual designer on his/her design process.
3.2
Object of Study
Purposive sampling was adopted to choose the object of study and the researcher
judged and selected the samples. There were four people to be interviewed with, who
were the designers of brand S (including two designers and two senior designers). The
products, services and management concepts of brand S are customer-oriented, 100%
customer satisfaction and complete sincerity. The theme under study is correlated to the
features of the population. The proﬁle of these four designers who applied empathy to
truly understand the real needs of users and meet their demands is listed in Table 1.

Results and Discussion
The case of brand S was studied and their designers were served as the objects of study.
They have more than one thousand showrooms around the island and their outlets are
mainly in the department stores, specialty shops and cosmeceutical stores. Four of their
ﬁve showcase designers were interviewed due to the huge quantity of their stores. How
these four designers applied empathy to design will be examined carefully in this
research. Cases of these four designers who put themselves in customers’ shoes will be
analyzed and their thinking models in design will be generalized.
4.1
Comparative Research Analysis
The individual design process, ideas and implementation of these four designers are
compared and analyzed with eight question items and summarized in Table 2. The
comparison is concluded as follows:
The design process of the designers is summarized as the following: the same
places of the brand are that (1) designers investigate prior to design, including site
surveys, measurement, understanding customer segments and communication with
users; (2) designers communicate with people participating in the design project over
the design plan, 3D drawing and 3D virtual drawing during the design process;
(3) designers coordinate and communicate with collaborative manufacturers over
implementation; and (4) designers inspect and review upon completion for design
evaluation.
The different places are that: (1) designers interview with users face to face for an
in-depth understanding of users’ needs and experience the product and the service
process in person for investigation before design; (2) presentation of design details,
consideration of costs, drawing communication and creative implementation during the
design process differ; (3) completion schedule differences, production costs, design

Analysis Result of Grounded Theory
Open coding is to retrieve the terms (schema) related to the subject from data collected
through in-depth interviews and the schema is condensed to several categories, which
become concepts or themes (cognitive structure) that symbolize special meanings of the
data. As these four designers were interviewed respectively, the in-depth interviews and
the grounded theory are analyzed and summed up as follows: 367 concepts in total with
75 sub-categories and 24 categories. These main and sub-categories are then introduced
to the individual empathic design thinking model (Table 3).
P1 has 87 concepts, 17 sub-categories and 6 categories, whose design process is
illustrated in Fig. 4. P2 has 68 concepts, 18 sub-categories and 6 categories, whose

Conclusion
It is found from the research that different design ﬁelds lead to various applications of
empathic design steps and methods after a cross comparison of empathic design the-
ories and design practice. As far as the showroom design area is concerned, empathic
design ways used by these four designers respectively include (1) putting oneself in
other’s shoes, (2) experiencing in person, (3) on-site practice, (4) instinctive design,
(5) listening to customers, (6) achieving a consensus and (7) association. Finally,
empathic design in the showcase design domain is deﬁned as follows: problems are
located from the showcase design locale and designers provide satisfactory service to

customers via empathic design methods like putting oneself in other’s position,
experiencing in person, on-site practice, and listening to customers, etc.

Abstract. In online e-Commerce platform service design, feedback delaying
occurs in different service scenarios, which has become one of the key issues of
the current service design and user experience study. Based on the previous
research on the feedback delaying during interaction, we took the Chinese
consumer as an example and focused our research on the inquiry feedback
service delaying when the servants answer the consumer’s questions in online
e-Commerce platform. We adopted the methods of protocol analysis and
emotional scales and arranged different feedback delays into the inquiry tasks
and obtained the consumer’s oral reports and subjective rating scores. We
analyzed the levels of emotion and experience and gained the quantitative
indicator of emotional experience. At last, we proposed a correlation model
between different feedback delaying and emotional experience levels in online
e-commerce platform, which produced a trial design guide of feedback delaying
service design in online e-commerce platforms.

Introduction
Feedback online is one of the most important issues in service design on e-commerce
platform. During e-commerce serving, the feedback delaying is a kind of time delay
when the user operates and waits for the service system or servicer’s feedback resulting
in the impact of the user’s emotional experience, which is an essential issue in service
design and user experience research. In early 1993, Nielsen has proposed the impacts
of three kinds of time delay (0.1 s, 1 and 10 s) on user’s emotional perception, which is
the earliest study about the impact of time delay on the quality of user perception in the
ﬁeld of HCI. In 2003, the International Telecommunication Union established Rec-
ommendation ITU-T P.800.1 standard based on the delay of voice calls. This standard
focused how the quality of PSTN or CS voice type can affect user experience.

Furthermore, an experience quality has been proposed based on ﬁve-point scale
ranging from excellent to bad. In 2012, Lorentzen et al. put forward the difference
impacts between initial delay and interrupt delay on user experience of service and
product and built related theoretical model. Reichl et al. (2010) observed a distinct
sensitivity of user perception to response and download times in interactive services on
the web. Egger et al. (2012) also presented the delay impact on the quality of expe-
rience on web services. By the year of 2014, Ericsson APP coverage whitepaper
presented the impact on the user experience within 10 s delay.
Our experiment took the Chinese consumer as an example, participants were
recruited and asked to complete three different shopping tasks on one or two online
e-commerce platforms. On the basis of our previous research method of the verbal
analysis with Chinese language (Tan and Sun 2015), we analyzed the levels of emotion
and experience from the consumer’s oral reports and gained the quantitative index of
emotional experience. Moreover, with the consumer’s subjective scores in emotional
scales, a correlation model between different inquiring feedback delaying and the
different emotional experience levels in online e-commerce platform was designed,
which produced a trial guide of feedback delaying service design in online e-commerce
platform and help to promote the online e-commerce service experience.

Experiment
2.1
Participants
In this research, we invite 47 participants in total (21 male and 26 females). All
participants had online shopping experience with different length of time. Their ages
ranged from 18 to 51. 10 of the participants took part in the experiment 1 (5 male and 5
females). 17 of the participants took part in the experiment 2 (7 male and 10 females).
20 of the participants took part in the experiment 3 (9 male and 11 females).
2.2
Experimental Arrangement
The research was divided into three experiments. In Experiment 1, use the timer and
bell to record the point of the limit time. In Experiment 2, the participants were asked to
narrate their feelings using think aloud protocol and use the recording equipment to
record the experimental condition. In Experiment 3, the participants need to rate the
emotion scale.
2.3
Experiments
Experiment 1. To simulate the real online shopping environment, we made three
kinds of web pages (food, clothing and ofﬁce supplies) based on Taobao pages. Every
participant need to complete three tasks. In each task the participant selects a product
the experimenter speciﬁed. Then the participant need ask the customer service whether
The Emotional Experience of Inquiry Feedback Delaying
789

the products are in stock and wait for the reply. When the participant send the message,
experimenters started timing and marked the time point as T0 (=0). The participants
rang when they start to feel impatient, experimenters marked this time point as T1.
Finally, the experimenters calculated average of T1 (Fig. 1: Experiment 1 process).
Experiment 2. Experiment 2 had n parts and in each part the participants can ask any
questions to the customer service. They need to wait for the answers for different length
of time in different parts. During the experiment their verbal reports were recorded.
In experiment 1 we got the limit time T1. Based on this limit time we divided the
waiting time into several parts. In these parts participants need to wait different length
of time. Each neighboring parts has a difference of 3 s. So for each part the waiting
time is 3 s (ﬁrst part), 6 s (second part)…T2 (n part) (Fig. 2).
Process Methods and Measurements of Verbal Report. Direct extraction method:
adjective and adverbs of degree that appeared explicitly in sentences were directly
extracted (Table 1).

Situational Extraction. Sometimes the feedback from participants did not contain any
obvious adverbs or adjectives. One way we could judge the participants’ attitude in this
case is that judge through colloquial descriptions (including exclamatory and inter-
rogative sentences) and intonation combined with the context in which the language
was uttered. Once interpreted, this raw data was translated into adjective-dominated
declarations (Table 2).
Verbal Language Environment Extraction. Another way to judge participants’ attitude
in the case that the feedback we got did not contain any obvious adverbs or adjectives
was through the analysis of participants’ verbalized assumptions, comparisons, sug-
gestions, and expectations. After being analyzed, this language was translated into
adjective-dominated declarations (Table 3).
Incidence-Description Extraction. The third way we could judge participants’ attitude
using feedback without any obvious adverbs or adjectives was through participants’
descriptions of the test process. We analyzed the movement and brain function of the
participants. Following analysis, the data was also translated into adjective-dominated
declarations (Table 4).
Classiﬁcation of Adjectives. The data—adjectives and adverbs—were then coded in
accordance with the guidelines set forth by Ma Shi When Tong. First, adjectives were
classiﬁed according to whether they were positive or negative. If an adjective expressed
a relatively pleasant position (such as “good” or “easy”), it was coded as positive (+). If
an adjective expressed a relatively unfavorable position, such as tension or worry, it
was coded as negative (−). After classifying the adjectives, the total amount of each

kind of adjective was determined. In our analysis here, this amount is expressed by the
number n occurrences of each adjective type.
Adverbs were coded differently. Because the participants’ reports were recorded in
Chinese and, for the sake of accuracy, analyzed in Chinese, the processing of adverbs
made reference to the local grammar. According to the XinHua Dictionary, adverbs of
degree can be divided into four categories: intense, high, moderate, and low. According
to these categories, adverbs extracted from the data were arranged on a Likert scale
with eight levels. Intense, high, moderate, and low positive adverbs were assigned 4, 3,
2, and 1 points, respectively. Likewise, intense, high, moderate, and low negative
adverbs were assigned −4, −3, −2, and −1 points, respectively. Neutral adverbs were
assigned 0 points (Table 5).
Experiment 3. In Experiment 3, the participants will complete the n parts same as
Experiment 2 and when they complete each part, they have to rate the affective
dimensions using the Self-Assessment Manikin (Fig. 3).

The Self-assessment Manikin. The participant need to rate their emotion in 9 levels
(upset and calm). 1 is very irritable, 9 is very calm, 5 is the intermediate emotion
between irritable and calm. Assessment materials are the Self-Assessment Manikin by
Bradley and Lang (1994).

Results
3.1
Experiment 1
This study tested what is the last straw of subjects when they wait for the Customer
Services reply in three kinds of products respectively.
When buying food item online (such as Three Squirrels), subjects’ average
impatience time T1 is 31.9 s. While buying Ofﬁce Supplies online (such as Deli), the
average impatience time T1 is 31.3 s. As for the clothing category which took Sun-
dance as an example, T1 is 33.3 s (Experimental result has listed in the following
Fig. 4).
3.2
Experiment 2
In experiment 2, the subjective experience of 11 tests used the same experimental
materials, the only difference between these tests is the time of customer services reply.
While testing, the experimenter recorded the subjective verbal reports, then analyzing
the emotion of these reports. At last, calculating average of subjects’ positive and
negative emotion then divided into ﬁve levels.
The ﬁrst thing to be done in this experiment is determining the positive and neg-
ative tendencies of user experience. For instance, user A said: “wow! It replies me so
Fig. 4. Limit waiting time of the participants
The Emotional Experience of Inquiry Feedback Delaying
793

fast!” So the positive emotion can be identiﬁed from a response like this. Secondly,
using the grading scale above, adverbs of degree were added to the existing positive
and negative adjective tallies, and weighted at a value of 4, 3, 2, or 1 according to
which of the four adverb categories they belonged to. According to the method of
emotional analysis based on verbal Chinese (Tan and Sun 2015), we calculated the user
experience using this formula.
SUX ¼ 1

X

means the total number of all adjectives belonging to the same category, ni represents
the number of occurrences of a certain grade in a certain adjective, ai on behalf of the
represented the weight value of that grade. M is 4 on behalf of the four different
weights, and Sux is the weighted average of participants’ evaluations of different tests
based on this data.
As the experiment only aims to explore a single factor’s, namely the feedback
time’s inﬂuence on the user experience of online shopping, and every participant
experienced all 11 tests of this experiment, the results are ideal. The adjectives
extracted from the original data have a high repetitive rate and all of them can be
classiﬁed into 2 categories: fast and slow. This means that we can easily rule out the
inﬂuence of the uncertainty of the weight of other factors and focus on the unidi-
mensional inﬂuence of feedback time. In this case, the conﬁdence coefﬁcient a identity
in 1. And the value of Sux represents the overall user experience of speciﬁc tests.
It is obvious that as the feedback time lengthen, user experience gradually becomes
worse. According to the method above, the highest score (3.09) appears when the
feedback time is 3 s. In this case, all user experience are positive. And the ﬁgure
reached the bottom at −3.16 when the feedback time is 31 s. So the overall range of the
participants’ score is 3.09 to −3.16. It is important to note that when the feedback time
increased to 9 s, negative user experience appears, then positive and negative user
experience coexist for the next 9 s until the feedback time lengthened to 18 s, all
participants turned into negative emotion. The experimental data has shown in Table 6
and Fig. 5 listed below.
3.3
Experiment 3
We got the average scores of the affective dimensions from the participants (Table 7),
then divided these scores into ﬁve levels (Table 8, Fig. 6).
At the same time, according to the scale of the test, we analyzed the score trend of
customer service reply time for different shopping experience (Fig. 7), by the table can
794

be seen, in the same waiting time, Love Heart user’s score is higher, the lowest score
were Pink crown users. The overall trend according to the score from high to low is
Heart users, Gold diamond users, Gold crown users, Pink crown users.
3.4
Analysis on the Results
By comparing the analysis results of the user’s oral reports and scale scores, which
prove the consistency of the user oral reports and subjective rating scale (Fig. 8).
According to the experiments, user’s average limit waiting time is about 32.2 s.
According to the user’s oral report and scale score, users’ emotion changes when
waiting for the reply can divided into ﬁve grades. From the verbal reports, the level ﬁve
to the level four is the transition stage of emotion, behind the third grade, start from
grade four the users only have negative emotions (about 15 s). The third level was the
user’s positive and negative emotion change level. In summary, we divided the point of
user’s emotional change into three stages (Fig. 9), the ﬁrst stage is 0–8 s and the
second stage is 9–17 s, and the third stage is after 18 s.

Conclusion
Online shopping is a complex interactive process, as a whole, each procedure
(browsing information of products, asking for shopping advice, purchasing orders and
so on.) will affect the user experience feelings. Providing a high quality of service is a
key point to affect customers’ purchase decisions. However, when facing numerous
customers’ inquiries, it is difﬁcult to reply every customer in time. From the analysis of
the results of oral reports and subjective scoring through experiments, we found that
users have different emotional reactions during different feedback delays which result
in different shopping feelings. For resolving this problem, different interaction mea-
sures can be designed in each period to improve the user experience of shopping
service. Form the emotional model experiment based on phased emotional experiences,
we can make targeted services designed by different interactions. For example, in the
initial stage (0–8 s) to give customers quick response, we translate common issues to
digitally encode in order to give users fuzzy answer, which could resolve a number of
customer problems. In the second phase (9–17 s), the platform can provide some
information of the commodity business philosophy to maximize the users’ residence
time. After 18 s, the sellers can give some kinds of discounts, free postage, membership
services and other value-added promotions strategies to increase the user’s propensity
to buy.
At the same time, compare the users experience of online shopping, it is obviously
that users with more shopping experience are impatient than the less experienced users
based on our experiment data. The back-end data ﬁltering can be set to certain privi-
leges for more experienced users or give certain privileges embodied in the consulting
platform interface, to enhance emotional interaction with users and promote their
emotional experience to loyalty.

Future Work
Experimental study in this article is limited to the Chinese online shopping platform, so
there are still several problems need to be solved. At ﬁrst, we will subdivide consult
situations and shopping segments for the speciﬁc situation of each different process,
and observe mood changes in different feedback delays under different situations, to
discover user feedback mood changes in separate shopping consultations. Secondly, we
will divide products into different categories, and compare the differences between
different types of merchandise buying behavior in diverse product categories. Fur-
thermore, there are numerous works need to do to help us explore more details about
the user experience on e-commerce platform.
• More research on the different stages in the process of online shopping, compare the
different experience based on pre-sale service, sale service, after-sale service.
• Design and compare different interaction ways to abstract customers in the website
from different angles, like product introduce, selling strategy then measure its
validity.

Abstract. There are problems and challenges in transition to a circular economy
in China. The challenges may vary from micro scope to macro scope: the micro
scope, that of individual behavior, relates to the consumption habits in one’s
everyday life; the meso scope, that of groups where the individual may still have
some inﬂuence, involves the companies and organizations with their ways of
producing and delivering their products and services; the macro scope, that of
ecosystem, which means seeing the natural domain and human society as a whole
system. Alternative to the government-oriented reform, companies should take
the lead in the transition from bottom-up. There are catalysts needed to get
companies change. Design, with its various capabilities, could provide “activation
energies”.

Introduction
A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose)
in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value
from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end
of each service life [1]. The transition towards a circular economy has the potential to
change the situation that economy growth is heavily dependent on resource consumption
in China. It works to decouple the economic development and the resource consumption.
Circular economy approaches save industry money through reduced cost of resources
and energy, generate revenue from waste streams and retention of value in existing
infrastructure, as well as assets through new business models such as leasing.
The development of circular economy thoughts originated in 1966, when Boulding
presented the idea in his spacecraft economy, a shift way of thinking from the traditional
open system to a circulation of closed loop of materials; in 1989, with Pearce putting
forward the use of the word “Circular Economy” in English, and the rising of Industrial
Ecology in the 1990’s, research on circular economy formed its imposing manner; since
2010, In UK, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (hereinafter referred to as EMF) has led
the upgrading to an optimized version, with the joint eﬀorts from enterprise and higher
education.
3R, namely reduce, reuse, and recycle, is the operation principle of circular economy.
There are two directions of development followed this 3R principle. The one focuses

on recycle, mainly related to waste management; the other one underlines reuse, as
Stahel and other, claiming a new economic system.
Over the past decade in China, the main approaches to transit to the circular economy
are mostly from top down and government took the initiatives. For example, from 2001
to 2011, in ten years, 60 state-level eco-industry parks had been constructed to demon‐
strate the systemic circulation of ecological industrial organization. However, to truly
realize the circular economy transformation, especially at the city level, enterprises
should be the leading force. Diﬀerent from the government, with large amount of invest‐
ments to stimulate the transformation, seeking out consistently proﬁtable model with
the framework and concept provided by circular economy and design innovation, is the
key for enterprises to success. In addition to developing venous industry of recycling,
the tendency today is towards to develop second-hand goods exchange, sharing
economic or collaborative consumption. Many projects that are currently operating need
to be connected in order to form a systemic circulation. Bottom up projects initiated by
companies should become major contributors.
To realize this systemic transformation, the challenges may vary from micro scope
to macro scope: the micro scope, that of individual behavior, relates to the consumption
habits in one’s everyday life; the meso scope, that of groups where the individual may
still have some inﬂuence, involves the companies and organizations with their ways of
producing and delivering their products and services; the macro scope, that of ecosystem,
where the natural domain and human society should be regarded and researched as a
whole system.
These are enormous challenges; we are facing the notion of complex interaction,
iteration and uncertainty. What is calling is a systemic approach which uniﬁes and
concentrates on the interaction between elements and the eﬀects of those interactions,
and integrates the relationships during the course of time.
Design, with its nature of solving problem through synthesis, has potential to take
up the challenges from various scopes mentioned above through interventions in various
levels of system and at various action points in processes to build up a regenerative cycle
in a new ecosystem.
In UK, the interdisciplinary collaboration in the innovation to accelerate the transi‐
tion to circular economy is emphasized, and design is regarded as one of the three main
driven forces. In the book The Circular Economy: A Wealth of Flows, a publication by
EMF in 2015, circular economy is deﬁned as: “one that is restorative by design, and
which aims to keep products, components and materials at their highest utility and value,
at all times.” The highlight of design is obvious. Design is put at the key position to the
implementation of circular economy.

Challenges in Closing the Loop of Reuse
Walter Stahel stated reuse as good strategy: “The linear model turned services into
products that can be sold, but this throughput approach is a wasteful one. In the past,
reuse and service-life extension were often strategies in situations of scarcity or poverty

and led to products of inferior quality. Today, they are signs of good resource husbandry
and smart management.” [2].
Where living standards are low, sharing may well be the only way to aﬀord commod‐
ities. At the beginning of the 20th century in Europe, shared cooking and washing facili‐
ties were typical in the apartment buildings; people were used to waiting in turn to use
something. After the Second World War, the quick growth of economy changed the
situation, and the microwave and the washing machine are considered to be basic needs
for every household. Today in China, shared electric appliance and facilities could be
found at many places in less developed areas, such as remote rural villages and city
slums; while in the modern cities, shared facilities are rare in new built communities,
and every family has their own household appliances.
In the era of consumption, a kind of consumer habit has been cultivated that people
are inclined to possess a product in order to use it at any time one wants to, and to deﬁne
one’s own status, even the product is not useful for him. In a recent survey in China’s
rural area, videos were recorded of the 24-h daily behavior in the household; a phenom‐
enon was discovered that the refrigerator in the kitchen was seldom used and always
empty, but in the village where this survey was taken place, every household had at least
one refrigerator. Villagers bought refrigerator as it was perceived as a sign of modern
life style and got ambivalence to it after ﬁguring out they do not need it as they easily
access to fresh food.
Normally, a consumer makes the choice between leasing and temporarily using a
product supplied by a provider and buying a product for owning it, depending on
consideration of the following aspects:
– Relative aﬀordability
– Functionality and usage
– Freedom and convenience
– Identity and status
The ﬁrst two are commonly considered together. When buying is expensive and the
product is only needed for once or for a very short period of time, chances are that the
product will be rented rather than be bought. But, if renting is barely cheaper than buying,
and the product provided not attractive or well maintained, it will be the opposite. In
many cases, the last two aspects are more decisive. With the traditional linear model,
companies try to sell more goods to generate proﬁt. For example consumers are encour‐
aged to possess a whole set of kitchen appliances and utensils, even some tools are barely
used. They buy for the convenience that they can use it whenever they want. The reason
they buy these sought of tools is also because renting is not as easily accessed as buying
in today’s community. Another example is that companies upgrade their products
frequently and consumers are incited to buy the new series when their old version prod‐
ucts are still working well. In these cases, people buy to show who they are. People own
much more than they use which is why it is so diﬃcult to compete with economic mate‐
rial growth. Sharing and renting somehow have to ﬁnd their way in. New business
models for sharing and reusing are to be designed, and consumer habits and behaviors
should be carefully studied and considered.

In China, from rural to urban areas, a lot of bottom-up social innovation practices
have been emerged, kinds of sustainable products and sharing services are provided by
small start-ups, and certain companies are exploring into new business models to get
proﬁt through maximizing the product usage and extending its service life. But regarded
to China’s overall economic scale, these practices are still in a state of fragmented. On
the contrary to these emerging practices, most of the existing mainstream businesses
still maintain a certain market, and the products they provide are closely connected to
the consumers’ habits and unsustainable ways of living. They take a wait-and-see atti‐
tude to transition to the new circular model, and regard that reform will be beneﬁcial
only when the company getting privilege by policies and/or getting large amount of
investigation from government.
At the same time, most of the company’s internal structures of organization are bound
to the linear economic model, transformation means more than just researching and
developing innovative sustainable products and services, it also means that the company
needs internal organization reform. Moreover, comparing to many start-ups and social
companies initiated by designers, where open design is regarded as the main approach
to achieve innovative outcomes, those traditional companies with linear business models
oversee the design capabilities. Their understandings of design are still staying in the
design 1.0 era. Many of them only look into the technical sphere to ﬁnd innovative
solutions when they are seeking ways of change. For a time, mainly in the top-down
approaches, companies adopted new technologies to produce more eco-friendly prod‐
ucts, for which more cost added to purchase new materials and pay for new crafting
processes. In many ways, the perception of sustainability has come to a notion of high
cost and low proﬁt. For lacking of understanding of design and underestimating design’s
capability, many companies ignored possible opportunities to gain proﬁt and growth
when developed sustainable business models and delivered products and services in
sustainable ways.
In China, design thinking and open innovation should be introduced to the main‐
stream companies, such as textile, home appliances manufacturers. Design thinking and
open design methods could help them to change mindset and reform their internal
organizational structure, to become more innovative and more adaptable to the present
situation of rapid transformation. Via ongoing eﬀorts in co-creation practices, they will
ﬁnd the way to change and growth; and become successful adopter of the new economy.

Capabilities of Design for Enabling the Transition
There are “activation energies” required to get business to change. Could design oﬀer
the energies in need? Mainly in three ways design could be beneﬁcial and act as catalyst
to the transition.
The value creation by design could be one of these “activation energies”. Design
always has the capability to recognize unusual opportunities to create value, particularly
intangible one [3]. Intangible value creation in the process of service is enabled by design
Design for Transition to a Circular Economy
803

of the product service system. Experience, social connection, and other kinds of intan‐
gible values are the reason consumer would like to adopt the sharing and renting than
the buying.
When Uber, a smart car service provider, came to China, it launched an event of
“celebrity drives for you”. People were excited in taking Uber cars for the opportunity
of meeting celebrities. Although it was only a temporary service provided, it highlighted
and made it visible that the trip with Uber has diﬀerent experience from taking a taxi or
driving by oneself. It is about serendipity to meet with interesting people, interesting
cars and at the same time a convenient and relax trip. It was this intangible value which
other kind of services don’t oﬀer. As a series services similar to this are emerging in the
market, people are more and more considering taking alternative way when travel.
In a community creation project in an old area in Shanghai city last winter, designer
built up a small playground at the street corner for children living in the community
using abandoned bike racks at the site. It was also taken as a neighborhood interaction
space by the residents when completed. The project had a very low budget for moving
the bike racks to shape the game installation, changing the surface color for a vivid
appearance for the kid’s preference, and wrapping up the steel frame with shockproof
packaging material to achieve security, but a completely diﬀerent experience were
gained, and a whole new service life was given to the used bike racks. It is the design
eyes see the shape of bike rack and the space it formats usually provide the use of parking
bikes could, in another way, be used as a space for children to climb and play.
Recently, Alibaba added a new application Idle Fish to its successful app group
served as a platform for users to exchange second-hand items; it connects to Taobao,
the successful C2C online shopping platform founded in May 2003 by Alibaba, and
shares many existing resources in Taobao application, to provide the accessibility of
second-hand transactions. On this platform, many items were formerly purchased from
Taobao, product information is already available and easily to forward to the second
hand trading platform, great convenience is oﬀered smartly. And through this platform,
people interested in similar products or related topics in everyday life exchange ideas,
stories and photos, social connections are thus built up. In this context, reusing and
sharing are no longer signs of negative status, but a kind of culture of social interaction.
Experience and the social connection are the two examples of mindset shift engine which
make the reusing and sharing valuable choices to consumers.
The second “activation energy” design could provide is empathy. Companies
normally think of users in terms of market segments. Normally in a consumer ques‐
tionnaire, preferences are separate and cannot provide an integrated image for consumer
to choose, they can only rely on the image they try to form up by the limited information
provided and with reference to the existing products on the market. These surveys can
hardly be helpful as people make decisions ﬁnally in an integrated way. And they are
especially weak when encountering the case that designers try to change the consumer
behavior by design intervention. People may not tell you how they will make an alter‐
native choice. The current situation is that, though many have the awareness of the
environmental crisis and sustainability, they will still stay with the old ways of living
as long as the market provides the same kind of services as before. With the stereotype
image of the access model services, directly asking question to the customers can only
804
H. Yang

get similar answers showing the current phenomenon. Design process can explore the
potential needs people do not know to ask. By an approach of observation of what people
do and with methods of user study it could lead to real insights.
There are successful examples of understanding users by design empathy and coming
up with new business opportunity. TU Delft IDE student Sarah Bork carried out her
graduation project at Interface®. Interface® is ﬂoor covering provider and an early
Access Model adopter. Sarah researched related services provided by other companies
such as cleaners, architects and installers. In her research, she ﬁgured out nuance diﬀer‐
ences between users, this helped her to come up with diﬀerentiated Product Service
System, with three types of users: “high image”, “true green & functional”, and “fast
movers”. Distinguishing between diﬀerent kinds of users doubles the economic lifespan
of carpet tiles from 7 to 14 years, leading to a match of economic and technical lifespan.
Lowering recycling frequency and oﬀering more pricing ﬂexibility improves interface’s
ﬁnancial performance [4].
Then comes to the third “activation energy” design is capable to contribute to make
the change. It is the ability to visualize ideas. By visualizing and prototyping ideas,
giving abstract ideas concrete images and shapes, design makes the stakeholders see
possibilities in an integrated way, and enables user tests in a transformed context. Even
in the case of no new product is needed, for example the sharing or reusing of an existing
product, visualizing the activities and interaction between users and stakeholders,
involving all elements in the context and environment services provided, designers and
co-creators can discuss and compare diﬀerent options. With a set stage for the test, user
behavior could be studied in the new context transformed by the new service provided.
And this is vital for innovative ideas which do not have reference in the current situation.

Changing Contexts in Design
Establishing product service system by design is the key to accelerate the transition and
enable the circulation of reusing and sharing. A “product-service-system” is a blend of
products, communication strategies, services and spaces that are used in an integrated
way to oﬀer comprehensive, ethical solutions to complex demands [5]. Designing
product service system for access business model under the principle of reuse for a
circular economy, the design principles and contexts are shifting.
The center of the product-service-system is the people (users, suppliers, employees,
or stakeholders in general) who interact with all these multiple design components,
which are part of the system as well. Not only users but all people, and their activities,
interactions needed to be considered in the systems. Diﬀerent with the products designed
for individual owning for a long time, when coming to the design for a product of service,
for example a product for share and reuse, the contexts it will be used in are varied. For
example, diﬀerentiated demanding and preferences will occur when designing a table
for rental in a co-working space, as the user will work in a collaborative mode and may
have diﬀerent interactions with the table and with other people working together with
him in such context. And the return of the table after use, the disassembly and/or repair
by the providers, the material and resource eﬀectiveness are all important issues to be
Design for Transition to a Circular Economy
805

considered, to ensure each link in the process of circulation being connected easily and
ﬂuently. The principles for this design goal are as followed: ease of maintenance and
repair, ease of dis- and reassemble, adaptability and upgradability, standardization and
compatibility. In addition to this, understanding that the human activities and behaviors
are inﬂuenced by the instant environment and the context is also fundamental for
working with the context for a product service system. Complex interaction, iteration
and uncertainty are the notion may designers encounter. A dynamic and systemic vision
is needed when comes to the context of a product service system for an access business
model.
In case study of the sharing and reusing service in China, it shows that the adopter
and user of those services are a very speciﬁc group of people. These are neither the
normally range of demographic characteristics nor a propensity to buy things within the
categories of interest to a company. These are people with intention to collaborate and
who are more open to the sustainable way of living, and they are all match the storytelling
of the speciﬁc service. Thus it can be seen that the development and operation of a
speciﬁc sharing and reuse service model need to ﬁnd its speciﬁc user group. It requires
solid ﬁeld survey and user study, as well as working and creating together with the
potential users to generate real vital system of products and services.
Work on complex projects goes beyond the knowledge of one person to require the
knowledge and skills of people from diﬀerent disciplines. They need to coordinate their
activities and synthesize their knowledge. Here, designers are to be working together
with experts from ends of market, business and technology, as well as together with
potential users and possible stakeholders. Designers will not only work on the products
or the graphics which are the traditional orders for design discipline, they are to be
working on the synthesis of the activities and knowledge of all the participators. They
will design and generate new tools and methods to communicate with experts, users and
stakeholders, to ensure their ideas and potential needs are properly communicated; and
they will need also to provide convenient tools and friendly interfaces in order to create
more open and innovative atmosphere for all the people working together.

Conclusions
Apart from the market, looking to the current situation in design education in China,
could we say that the framework and worldview of circular economy has taken its place
in what we understand of design and the general sense of problem solving? There is a
good reservoir of teachers and many enthusiastic learners who wish to see change for
the better, a more prosperous, thriving world and citizens active in their democracies.
This has been true for the decade but it is hard to say that it has operated to create more
than in a piecemeal fashion.
Design schools or colleges can serve as a special agency, playing an important role
in promoting enterprises’ transformation to circular economy. It is not just because the
design schools and colleges are the incubator for cultivating the future talents in design,
but also because they are the active agencies for innovation practices, researches and
experiments, collaborating with enterprises, scientiﬁc research institutions, technology

development department and government. They are to work in the context of the big
picture demand of the circular economy in world view, pedagogy, skills and aptitudes
as well as new knowledge, and for the integrated systems which could work on the larger
scale to create circular cities.

Abstract. In public places, people’s energy conservation decisions and behav‐
iors are easily suppressed by contextual and/or personal factors. To perform and
maintain energy-saving behaviors, people need to be empowered both externally
and internally. This research explored how a smart agent could help. The ﬁrst
study revealed that when a smart agent empowered people externally by oﬀering
help, people would be more active and resolute in decision-making and more
likely to save energy, while some would be unaﬀected and decide to use energy.
The second study found that the acknowledgement of behavioral impact could
signiﬁcantly facilitate people’s evaluation processes and enhance their self-eﬃ‐
cacy, but such eﬀects would be moderated by the time cost of a task, which was
proved positively correlated with the perceived task diﬃculty. Both theoretical
and practical implications for energy conservation were discussed, and six guide‐
lines for smart agent design were proposed.

Introduction
As the internet of things is burgeoning, there have been more possibilities that we can
promote energy conservation by building an intelligent home or oﬃce environment
(Roalter et al. 2010) since energy use could be visualized, monitored, and controlled
with ease.
The advantages of an intelligent energy-saving environment would not be fully
exploited if human factors were omitted. For instance, if notiﬁcations or feedbacks were
not properly designed, it would hardly boost people’s awareness of energy use (Anker-
Nilssen 2003). Furthermore, however powerful an intelligent system is, we should
remember that it will take time for the system to spread and get fully implemented, and
any system could fail, hence people’s own determination and eﬀorts are indispensable
in intensifying and sustaining their optimal performance in energy conservation. There‐
fore, this research tried to ﬁnd out what design features of the system could make energy
conservation noticeable in a certain context, easy to achieve, and durable without
external aids, as well as how would people react to those features and why would they

do so? Two empirical studies were conducted to answer these questions and a set of
guidelines for persuasive agent design were proposed.

Literature Review
2.1
Motivators and Barriers to Energy-Saving Behavior
Most models think that user’s environmentally behavior is determined by user’s envi‐
ronmental consciousness or environmental concern (H’Mida et al. 2008). Two groups
of factors would inﬂuence user’s intension and behavior. One is internal/psychological
factors, including user’s value, attitude, knowledge, skill and ability, and perceived self-
eﬃcacy. The other is external/situational factors like social norms (Griskevicius et al.
2010), information, and other external incentives (Sahakian and Steinberger 2011).
There are also some barriers. A model that explains the barriers between environmental
concern and actual action (Kollmuss and Agyeman 2002) identiﬁed three barriers as
individuality, responsibility, and practicability. Specially, individuality refers to barriers
caused by passive attitudes (i.e., laziness, lack of environmental concerns) and personal
needs (i.e., keeping warm at home) (Van Raaij and Verhallen 1983).
2.2
Self-eﬃcacy and Behavioral Change
Self-eﬃcacy refers to the self-appraisal to one’s own capability of coping with a certain
task. People would eschew the predicament which they reckon as beyond their coping
capabilities, but conﬁdently undertake what they judge themselves capable of managing
(Bandura 1977). To obtain information in forming perceived self-eﬃcacy, people would
generally refer to performance attainments, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion and
physiological states (Bandura 1982). To make information instructive, cognitive
appraisal should be activated, hence cues or indicator should be provided (Bandura
1981). People’s self-eﬃcacy also have a causal relationship with their action (Bandura
et al. 1982). Empirical studies have proved the performance of actions to vary in response
to diﬀerent levels of perceived self-eﬃcacy. Meanwhile, this causation between
perceived self-eﬃcacy and action performance could be a mutually enhancing process:
At ﬁrst, people’s prejudgment about their self-eﬃcacy and coping capabilities would
partly determine how much eﬀorts they would devote, then their skill acquisition and
performance mastery, if satisfying, would boost their self-eﬃcacy in return (Bandura
1982), thereby shaping a positive feedback cycle.
2.3
Persuasion and Energy Conservation
Persuasive technologies have brought new possibilities into energy conservation. One
method is to visualize the energy use, enabling people to monitor energy use and get
timely feedback of behavioral impact (Fischer 2008; Pierce and Paulos 2012). But many
energy monitors have usability problems like users feeling “money were seeping out”
as the digits ﬂickering, or feeling routine activities like heating water being disturbed.
To Save or Not to Save? Let Me Help You Out
809

After a period of use, people got used to it gradually, so the feedback was no longer
incentive (Hargreaves et al. 2010). Both problems could be explained by self-eﬃcacy.
People obtained more pressure than eﬃcacy from the system, so the external incentives
failed to translate into people’s interests in saving energy. Therefore two features could
be added to strengthen the persuasive eﬀects of energy monitors. Firstly, let the monitor
act as an embodied conversational agent (Kirby et al. 2010) that could provide recom‐
mendations in explicit or implicit ways (Xiao and Benbasat 2007). It could result in less
decision time, less cognitive load, higher decision quality and higher self-conﬁdence,
hence people would gain more self-eﬃcacy. Secondly, let the agent execute simple and
repetitive tasks for people, so people would feel perceive tasks easier, and their behav‐
ioral intention can increase along with the increasing sense of control.

Research Framework
Based on the literature above, some hypotheses were proposed regarding user’s
perceived necessity of energy use, the empowerment of agent and the time cost which
lead to user’s perceived task diﬃculty and self-eﬃcacy, as well as user’s behavioral
impact which leads to the evaluation process and user’s perceived self-eﬃcacy.
Necessity: 
H1.1: In public places, when people need to make decision and perform action in
person, they do not have obvious consensus on the necessity of a certain energy use.
H1.2: In public places, the perceived necessity of using energy would not change
whether or not a smart agent could provide help, while the perceived necessity of
saving energy would increase if the agent could provide help.
Empowerment and Time Cost: 
H2.1: In public places, people would be more active and resolute in making decision
when being served by a smart agent that could provide help compared to the one that
could not.
H2.2: In public places, people would be more likely to save energy when being served
by a smart agent that could provide help compared to the one that could not.
H3.1: The perceived time cost and perceived diﬃculty of a task would be positively
correlated with the actual time cost of the task.
H3.2: The time cost of a task would moderate the eﬀect of acknowledgement of
behavioral impact.
Behavioral Impact: 
H4.1 The acknowledgement of behavioral impact would reduce the time people spent
in the evaluation processes.
H4.2 The acknowledgement of behavioral impact would enhance people’s self-eﬃ‐
cacy-related perceptions.

Study 1 – Empowerment
4.1
Methodology
Study 1 explored how people’s decisions of using/saving energy would be inﬂuenced
by a smart agent. 48 students of Tsinghua University (22 females, 26 males; average
age = 24.48, SD = 2.24) were invited as participants. A primary-secondary task meth‐
odology was adopted in the experiment: Participants were told that their primary task
was to watch a 30-min video then answer 5 questions about it. During their watching, a
smart agent named Intelligent Energy-Saving Environment would interact with them on
SNS, and participants were free to reply or not.
This independent variables include the Empowerment of agent and the Scenario of
energy use. Empowerment was a two-level between-subject factor, classiﬁed as In
Person level (Participants were both the decision maker and performer, while the Intel‐
ligent Energy-Saving Environment acted as a reminder) and Agent level (they system
acted both the reminder and performer, while participants merely made decisions).
Scenario was a within-subject factor with seven levels like turning oﬀ unused lights in
the corridor and turning oﬀ unused water heater in the lab. To measure the inﬂuence of
the Intelligent Energy-Saving Environment on the participants, their voluntary
responses to the reminders were collected as an indicator of their behavioral intention.
For either group, on receiving the same message, participants could choose “Save”
decision, “Use” decision or “Not Decide”.
4.2
Results
Chi-square test was done among the numbers of participants in the In Person group
choosing “Save” decision, “Use” decision and “Not Decide” on each of the seven
scenarios. It was found that in the ﬁrst six scenarios, the incidence of the three types of
decisions show no signiﬁcant diﬀerence (all ps > .05), while in the seventh scenario, the
incidence of S to prevail over that of U or N signiﬁcantly (p = .01). Therefore, H1.1 was
partly supported for the ﬁrst six scenarios, and was not supported by the seventh scenario
(Turning oﬀ unused printer in the lab). Paired t-test was done on the number of partic‐
ipants choosing “Use” decision between the In Person and the Agent groups. The diﬀer‐
ence was not signiﬁcant (t = 0.464, p = .659 > .05), therefore the ﬁrst part of H1.2 was
supported. Then nonparametric test was adopted to compare the mean. There was
signiﬁcant between two groups (p = .001 < .01). Hence H2.1 was supported. For the
number of participants choosing “Save” decision, paired t-test was adopted. The diﬀer‐
ence between two groups was signiﬁcant (p = .011 < .05), indicating people made more
energy-saving decisions when the smart agent could help, and hence the second part of
H1.2 and H2.2 were both supported.

Study 2 – Self-eﬃcacy
5.1
Methodology
Study 2 explored how people’s evaluation processes and self-eﬃcacy in energy conser‐
vation could be inﬂuenced by task diﬃculty and behavioral impact. 24 students of
Tsinghua University (12 females, 12 males; average age = 22.4, SD = 1.24) were invited
as participants. A prototype of mobile App named Energy-Saving Building would send
each participant six task reminders, showing that some appliances were still on in some
classrooms that had not been scheduled a class, and asked s/he to go there and have a
checkup, then evaluate task from several aspects.
Independent variables include the Acknowledgement of behavioral impact as a
between-subject factor, and the Time Cost of a task as a within-subject factor. Partici‐
pants were divided into two groups. The Energy-Saving Building App would only show
one group (denoted as Unshown) how many appliances they turned oﬀ without speciﬁc
information of behavioral impact, whereas it would show the other group (denoted as
Shown) how many appliances they had just turned oﬀ and how much energy they could
conserve on each appliance. Among the six tasks assigned to each participant, three tasks
took 25 s (Short) and the other three took 50 s (Long). For hypotheses testing, both
objective and subjective data were collected to measure how the two factors would aﬀect
participants’ evaluation processes and the perceptions related with self-eﬃcacy.
5.2
Results
Nonparametric test of Mann-Whitney U was adopted to compare the diﬀerence. The
correlation of actual time cost and perceived time cost was .627 (p < .001), of actual
time cost and perceived diﬃculty was .490 (p < .001), and that of perceived time cost
and perceived diﬃculty was .428 (p < .001). A task that took shorter time had resulted
in a signiﬁcantly smaller estimate of time cost compared with a task that took longer
(22.74 s < 46.66 s, U = 428.000, p < .001), and similarly, a shorter task generally
received a lower rating on task diﬃculty than a longer task (3.23 < 4.24, U = 1190.500,
p < .001). Therefore H3.1 was supported. When the time cost was short (25 s), only two
measurements manifested diﬀerence between two groups, whereas under longer time
cost (50 s), eight measurements were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced (p < .05). Therefore, the
hypothesis H3.2 was supported.
When the task took a longer time (50 s), all the time measurements of the Shown
group were signiﬁcantly smaller than the Unshown group, including the time spent on
evaluating the time cost, behavioral impact, task diﬃculty, behavioral meaningfulness,
and sense of achievement (all ps < .05). Therefore, H4.1 was supported in that the
acknowledgement of behavioral impact had reduced the time in people’s evaluating
process. Similarly, when the time cost was long, the subjective ratings given by the
Shown group on the self-eﬃcacy-related measurements were signiﬁcantly higher than
the Unshown group, including the perceived behavioral impact, perceived behavioral
meaningfulness, and the sense of achievement (all ps < .05). Hence H4.2 was supported
for the acknowledgement of behavioral impact had enhanced people’s self-eﬃcacy.

Discussion
From the perspective of user’s experience, it’s important how users would perceive the
energy-saving tasks, especially their understanding on whom that took credit after saving
the energy? This question calls for the concept of agency in the ﬁeld of cognitive neuro‐
science (Moore and Haggard 2008). Humans are also agents: They have the capacity to
take actions intentionally to change the external world, and they could consciously
experience such capacity through their actions. The experience of agency is, therefore,
“person’s sense of being in control of their actions and through this control of being
responsible for, or having ownership of, the consequences of those actions” (Coyle
et al. 2012). Meanwhile, people would also experience agency when interacting with an
intelligent system. Empirical studies have proved that the more assistance a system
provides, the less sense of agency a user would gain. Arguably, in this research, partic‐
ipants aided by the Intelligent Energy-Saving Environment would experience lower
agency and think, “The energy was actually saved by the intelligent system”, while the
Energy-Saving Building would make people believe that “It was me that saved the
energy!” The Intelligent Energy-Saving Environment and the Energy-Saving Building
would produce disparate experience in the user-agent interaction, and result in diﬀerent
behavior and self-eﬃcacy in energy conservation. At current stage we could not predict
which one would be better: the Intelligent Energy-Saving Environment could make tasks
much easier, but people could neither experience much agency nor gain much self-
eﬃcacy; the Energy-Saving Building could enhance self-eﬃcacy and agency, but such
incentives might satiate users in long-term.
Design Guidelines: Based on the ﬁndings and theoretical basis, the following six
design guidelines for smart agent were proposed, which are designed to persuade people
to save energy.
• Give users a nudge, remind them and hint the necessity.
• Let users feel the power of control, and believe the positive outcomes are all due to
their decisions.
• Understand users in diﬀerent situations, and assign tasks according to users’ habits,
level of self-eﬃcacy, and current situation.
• Retain reasonable uncertainty.
• Present behavioral impact.
• Keep the history, and create something new.

Conclusion
To promote user’s energy conservation behavior in public places, this research focused
on the persuasive eﬀects of smart agent and carried out two empirical studies. The ﬁrst
study found that when an agent could empower people with control, people would be
more active and determined in decision-making and more likely to make energy-saving
decisions. The second study found that providing information about behavioral impact
would facilitate people’s evaluation processes and enhance their self-eﬃcacy, and those

813

eﬀects would be moderated by the time cost of task, which was positively correlated to
the perceived task diﬃculty. Then this research discussed who should take credit after
saving the energy and proposed six guidelines for persuasive agent design.

Abstract. With the status of service industry in the social and economic
increasing, service design is received widespread attention. Touch point is an
important part of service design, that is the dynamic interaction between the user
and the service system, which aﬀects the user’s overall perception of the level of
service. Takeaway Online to Oﬄine as a vertical kind of special life service, the
essence of which is to meet the needs of users, providing the most optimized
dining solution. But there are many problems in the process of development of
Takeaway Online to Oﬄine, for instance, the food is not delivered on time, the
food is not health, which seriously aﬀect the quality of service. In order to explore
the optimization direction of the Takeaway Online to Oﬄine service, this paper,
basing on the theory of touch point, fully analyses the touch point of the process
of takeout online to oﬄine service from the perspective of service design, and
puts forward the methods and suggestions of optimization of service experience,
which includes two aspects. On the one hand, from macro level, that is estab‐
lishing reasonable division system, shaping brand image and perfecting the mech‐
anism of evaluation. On the other hand, from micro level, that is establishing food
community and reward system, indicating the operating state of peak period of
business operators, and designing behavior of personnel distribution.

An Exploration of Service Models of Takeaways O2O
With the increasing prevalence of smart phones and rapid development of internet, O2O
service has gradually entered people’s lives. At present, Takeaway is the most popular O2O
service. According to permanent data, Takeaway is expected to amount to RMB120 billion
in China in 2015, and there will be more than 0.2 billion online users [1]. Stimulated by
such market environment, internet companies have successively made plans and prac‐
tised. In 2013, “Alibaba” Group launched a mobile catering platform known as “Taodian‐
dian”. In the mean time, “Meituan “launched its takeaway services online based on its
advantages in group purchase. In 2014, “Baidu Waimai” (Takeaway) was launched online,
and the website “Dianping” strategically invested 80 million US dollars to become a share‐
holder of “ele.me”. The takeaway industry that has been constantly invested has tended to

achieve explosive development. Internet enterprises try to connect users with sellers in all
possible ways, so competition has become extremely fierce (Fig. 1).

Due to uncertainties of takeaway products and complexity of target groups, takeaway
market is still highly fragmented. According to availability of independent logistics
distribution system, its service model may be divided into two categories as follows.
One is light platform represented by Meituan (i.waimai.meituan.com), ele.me
(www.ele.me) and Baidu waimai. Concerning this model, services are provided through
platforms without logistics and food processing. They deliver orders received online to
sellers and have food distributed by third-party logistics companies. The other is heavy
model represented by platforms such as “WaimaiChaoren”, “line0” and “etaoshi”. As
regards this model, platform and logistics services are provided without food processing.
Apart from these mainstream models, diﬀerentiated service strategies are also explored
by some platforms to seek breakthroughs for making proﬁts. By connecting sellers with
users through thematic dating activities, the website “5qnc” hasn’t only enriched UGC
(User Generated Content), but also made users’ social relationships closer and services
stickier (Table 1).
2
Outstanding Problems with Development of Takeaway O2O
To maximize interests of users and businesses, takeaway platforms strive to provide the
best services. In spite of diﬀerent service models, they have met some common problems
that greatly impact quality of their services in the course of their development.
1. Worrying Safety and Hygiene of Takeaway. Food safety and hygiene have been
always pain points of takeaway industry. For instance, to rapidly expand their scale,
Takeaway O2O platforms like “ele.me” haven’t developed strict procedures to review
food providers joining in their platforms. As a result, these platforms are mixed with
some merchants who are unqualiﬁed for providing food. Additionally, administrative
departments’ supervision over takeaway platforms is inadequate that they fail to appro‐
priately cope with users’ complaints. After investigating and analyzing takeaway plat‐
forms, it is discovered from the perspective of collaborative innovation that a complete
scientiﬁc food and beverage safety and hygiene management system, including some
incentives and legal regulations, focusing on internal drives of service platforms and
supported by external supervision, shall be established, in order to improve users’
acceptance of takeaway safety, on the grounds that takeaway safety and hygiene don’t
only impact brand image and business performances of takeaway platforms, but also
arouse people’s worries about the whole industry of Takeaway O2O.
2. Backward Construction of Logistics Services. At present, light model is major
service model of mainstream companies of Takeaway O2O. In other words, only plat‐
forms are built, while food and beverage are delivered by third-party logistics compa‐
nies. In this case, food delivery is completely out of companies’ control. As a result,
problems about untimely food delivery and food safety may be easily caused. Users
complain about these problems most frequently, which happen for several reasons as
follows. On one hand, it is so complex and time-consuming to make independent logis‐
tics distribution available that takeaway companies are reluctant to invest money in that
respect, but concentrate more on increasing their online orders. On the other hand, crazy
818
M.Y. Zhou et al.

price subsidy has consumed most cash of companies, so no more capital is available for
logistics construction. However, food delivery is an important part of online services
and a major factor for users’ perceived experience of services. Therefore, it is a crucial
aspect to be explored in creatively designing services of Takeaway O2O.
3. Crazy Price Support and Unreasonable Resource Allocation. As a high-
frequency and low-price industry, Takeaway O2O is highly attractive for users in terms
of its price, so all takeaways consider price support as an important development
strategy. It is just because of this that takeaways have cost much money for competition
in this respect. For instance, the website “ele.me” has launched an event of free lunch
for 200, 000 people together with Focus Media. In addition, it adopts policies of diﬀer‐
ential subsidy like RMB10 oﬀ for a consumption of RMB20 and RMB30 oﬀ for a
consumption of RMB50. According to measurements, this platform spends a huge
amount of about RMB0.1 billion every month in such events. Besides, both Baidu
Waimai and Meituan are crazy about another round of ﬁnancing. Thus, such “money-
burning wars” becomes increasingly more intense and never appears to be suppressed
at all. Although such crazy acts of “money burning” make the Takeaway O2O appear
to be quite bustling, it is actually crisis-ridden. First of all, it is impossible to develop
customer loyalty by price support. Once these subsidies are suspended, users will turn
to other catering platforms. Next, price support is an unsustainable means involving no
technologies, because much money is invested for subsidizing price of food and
beverage that corresponding companies will permanently suﬀer losses and this will be
unfavorable for sustainable development. Furthermore, insuﬃcient resources are avail‐
able from other parts of takeaway services to improve construction and lead to poor
quality of the services on the whole. Price support may merely contribute to temporary
rapid increase in orders, but can’t be permanently practised in a sustainable manner.
Only improving quality of diﬀerentiated catering services is the right development
strategy for Takeaway O2O. For this purpose, resources, particularly money shall be
allocated by takeaways more reasonably and eﬃciently. In terms of resource output,
priorities are given to optimizing technologies and systems and considering core pain
points for “rapid delivery” of takeaway services.
Current Takeaway O2O is still a growing market facing various problems. In the
mean time, core pain points of Takeaway O2O haven’t been eﬀectively solved, and
development strategies diﬀer among takeaways. Although quality of takeaway services
has been improved to certain extent after ﬁerce market competition, on the whole, many
innovative aspects of such services are worthy of exploration. Therefore, with constant
expansion of businesses, better seamless experiences of catering services will be brought
to users if online and oﬄine services can be better integrated. This will not only become
a key concern of takeaways, but also an important driving force for development of the
whole Takeaway O2O towards correct directions.

Analysis on Touchpoints of Takeaway O2O
3.1
Service Touchpoints and Customer Journey Map
Like system design, service design highlights being user centered and concerned about
situation of the whole service system. In the ﬁeld of design, there is still no uniﬁed
deﬁnition of service design. According to deﬁnition of the International Association of
Societies of Design Research, service design means setting services from the standpoints
of customers for the purpose of guaranteeing service interfaces. From users’ points of
view, services may be classiﬁed into useful, usable and good services, while they may
be categorized to be eﬃcient and distinct by service providers [2]. However, enterprises
like IBM consider that service design means designing diﬀerent touchpoints of users
based on timeline via creative methods and processes while making constant adjust‐
ments of interactions between service providers and ultimate users. LIVE WORK, as a
famous service design company in England, pointed out in 2010 that in designing serv‐
ices, existing design ideas, technologies and methods were incorporated into the ﬁeld
of services to develop innovative ideas that could eﬀectively satisfy users’ requirements
for all elements by comprehensively considering multiple dimensions such as environ‐
ment, products and emotions.
In the process of designing services, concept of service design is always involved
no matter what methods and means are adopted. As key points for interactions between
users and service systems, service touch points have signiﬁcant impacts upon users’
perception of services [3]. Based on forms, touch points may be divided into physical
touch points, digital touch points, emotional touch points, invisible touch points and
integrated touch points. A service system may have multiple such touch points. Once a
user consecutively experiences several touch points of a platform, he or she will have
an overall impression on services of the platform. It is thus clear that touch point design
is essential for designing services of a platform.
As a major tool for designing touch points, customer journey map is a graphic method
for displaying information. A complete and eﬀective customer journey map generally
includes requirements, scenarios, interactions, users’ mental state and system state and
so on. This method is helpful for designers to understand real feelings of users to discover
pain points and opportunities of services in diﬀerent stages of experience, so as to make
the entire service system user-centered [4].
3.2
Analysis on Touch Points of Takeaway O2O and Innovation Strategies
After analyzing and summarizing touch points of Takeaway O2O service system, they
are visually presented through a customer journey map, as shown in Fig. 2. Three
modules of systematic innovative design are gained by summing up and analyzing seven
main touch points.
820
M.Y. Zhou et al.

Fig. 2. Customer journey ﬁgure of Takeaway O2O
(1) Establishing an Information Diﬄuence Mechanism for Food Ordering. In
users’ waiting for food, the major pain point consists in unpunctual delivery of takeaway.
This problem shall be solved from a systematic perspective. To be exact, a reasonable
diﬄuence mechanism shall be established for the stage when users order food. It may
be speciﬁcally executed from three perspectives. Firstly, a function shall be set up for
food reservation by means of marketing, in order that users won’t order food in rush
hours. Secondly, state information of catering service providers is displayed on a real-
time basis. Operation state of a catering service provider may be divided into two cate‐
gories, including good and crowded. In this way, users may have certain psychological
expectations in ordering food, and can accept even if food delivery is postponed. Oper‐
ation state of a catering service provider may be known from data feedbacks of orders.
Thirdly, sub-platforms shall be constructed for delicious food and beverage to accumu‐
late content of users and explore characteristic delicious food for small groups of
customers, so as to reduce their ordering pressure in rush hours. Meanwhile, personal‐
ized food may be customized according to tastes of users. Additionally, information
about takeaways shall be eﬀectively communicated. For instance, information of
pictures shall be real and presented as far as possible, so as to help users make quick
decisions. No matter what mechanism is utilized, the major objective is to minimize
The Innovation Research of Takeaway O2O
821

risks and make users take initiatives to improve natural experiences from takeaway
platforms.
(2) Shaping Brand Image. Takeaway platforms don’t only deliver delicious food, but
also living standards [5]. Therefore, it is necessary to make more eﬀorts to shape brand
images. This may be started with two keywords, including speed and emotions.
Concerning speed, catering manufacturers will immediately get order information from
takeaway platforms once users place orders, and then food will be cooked according to
standard procedures. Users may know about the food cooking process according to the
cooking schedules displayed on platforms. Once food is cooked, it will be delivered by
the nearest couriers to corresponding destinations by competing for orders through
delivery. Users shall be informed 2 to 5 min ahead of food and beverage delivery, in
order to give users rapid seamless high-quality service experiences. Provided that any
user chooses to cancel his order during his waiting for food, customer service specialist
of the platform shall handle it within an hour, to make the user feel that the services are
considerate.
The second keyword is emotion, which requires meticulously designing all details
of services. First of all, food packaging must be neat and clean, made from safe, sanitary
and degradable materials which are favorable for recycling. Next, design styles of
couriers’ clothing and logistics distribution vehicles shall be visually consistent with
takeaway platforms. At last, attention shall be paid to couriers’ professional qualities,
namely code of conducts and basic etiquettes in the course of distribution. Each food
delivery is a process of brand shaping, because users may have an overall impression
on services of the takeaway platform in dealing with the platform and its couriers.
Therefore, brand building is an important measure for increasing user satisfaction, user
ﬂow and corporate beneﬁts.
(3) Improving Evaluation System. At present, Takeaway O2O platforms usually
consider destination of their services is to deliver food and beverage to users. In contrast,
from the perspective of service sustainability, it is the beginning of another service when
users begin to have the food or beverage delivered [6], on the grounds that users won’t
make the most important comments on takeaway quality until their eating. Food manu‐
facturers and takeaway platforms must track users’ dining feedbacks. Thus, a complete
evaluation system shall be established to improve overall services. Users’ perception is
mainly impacted by three aspects as follows. Firstly, relationship between users and
food which are concerned about takeaway nature and food quality is the most important
factor. If takeaway is unsanitary in terms of quality, users may choose the report function
of a takeaway platform. Under this situation, both food manufacturers and service plat‐
forms shall actively solve the problems to appease users. If users have a low opinion of
takeaway, manufacturers and service platforms have to interview the users to seriously
take their advices and strive to improve quality of takeaways [7]. Secondly, people’s
contact. In other words, concerning standards for distribution personnel, indexes shall
be constructed to evaluate services of distribution personnel and incorporated into the
evaluation system. Evaluation results shall be connected with performance appraisal of
distribution personnel, to promote constant improvement of their services. Thirdly,
822
M.Y. Zhou et al.

connections between people and products, which matter about usability of products on
takeaway platforms. Once all services are based on indexes, eﬀective complete service
evaluation and feedback systems need to be established, in order to constantly improve
user satisfaction. Additionally, touch points of reward functions may be introduced,
namely users can reward businessmen and distribution personnel at ﬁxed amount if they
feel takeaway is sold with high quality and distributed at fast pace after they have the
food. Besides, the rewarded amount may be allocated according to the proportion desig‐
nated by users, so as to encourage businessmen to constantly improve quality of their
takeaways and distribution, for the ﬁnal purpose that users can have sustainable
delightful experience from services.
4
Conclusions
In light of problems with design of Takeaway O2O platforms, service touch points of
these platforms are completely analyzed and designed based on concepts of service
design. In the mean time, three systematic innovative design modules are put forward
to construct a diﬄuence mechanism, shape brand image and improve evaluation system.
As O2O service platforms, takeaways shall understand multiple factors such as pain
points of users’ demands, application environment, service content and touch points
during design, in order to appropriately plan service procedures of Takeaway O2O, pay
close attention to natural experiences of users and systematically analyze all details of
catering services, particularly oﬄine services and their touch points which are crucial
for designing services for Takeaway O2O platforms. As regards innovative design of
Takeaway O2O, it is more necessary to highlight user-centered system innovation. In
other words, better dining experiences are provided for users by overall intervention
with “products and services” to improve customer satisfaction.
