Preface
When a professor is asked what a preface is, she might paraphrase Webster’s dictionary 
thus:
A preface is an essay found at the beginning of a book. It is written by the author to set 
the book’s purpose and sometimes to acknowledge the assistance of others.
A nineteen-year-old college freshman, when asked what a preface is, could tell you that 
it was the debut album (released in August 2008) of hip-hop rapper eLZhi. This differ-
ence in mindset is the impetus for this edition.
We recognize that today’s freshmen are quite different from those of a few years ago. 
Text messaging and twitterTM have strongly influenced sentence length and structure. In 
current writing and conversation, short sentences or sentence fragments convey straight-
to-the-point information. Multimedia presentations are a way of life. Reflecting all this, 
we have come up with a seventh edition written by a “revised” team. The new member 
(EJN) is young enough to be fully in tune with today’s technology and speech.
Are We Still Committed to Writing a Short Book?
The answer is an emphatic yes! Rising tuition costs, depleted forests, and students’ ach-
ing backs have kept us steadfast in our belief that it should be possible to cover a text 
completely (or at least almost completely) in a two-semester course. The students (and 
their parents) justifiably do not want to pay for 1000-page books with material that is 
never discussed in the courses taught with those texts. 
What Is Our Criterion for Writing a Short Book?
The common perception is that a short book is a low-level book. We believe, however, 
that treating general concepts in a concise way can be done without sacrificing depth, 
rigor, or clarity. Our criterion for including material continues to be its importance and 
relevance to the student, not its difficulty. To achieve this, we decided on the following 
guidelines.
	 1.	 Eliminate repetition and duplication wherever possible. Like its earlier editions, this 
text uses
•	 Only one method for balancing redox reactions, the half-equation method intro-
duced in Chapter 4. 
•	 Only one way of working gas-law problems, using the ideal gas law in all cases 
(Chapter 5).
•	 Only one way of calculating ΔH (Chapter 8), using enthalpies of formation.
•	 Only one equilibrium constant for gas-phase reactions (Chapter 12), the thermo-
dynamic constant K, often referred to as Kp. This simplifies not only the treatment 
of gaseous equilibrium but also the discussion of reaction spontaneity (Chapter 
16) and electrochemistry (Chapter 17).
	 2.	 Relegate to the Appendices or Beyond the Classroom essays topics ordinarily cov-
ered in longer texts. Items in this category include
•	 MO (molecular orbital) theory (Appendix 4). Our experience has been (and con-
tinues to be) that although this approach is important to chemical bonding, most 
general chemistry students do not understand it but only memorize the princi-
ples discussed in the classroom.
•	 Nomenclature of organic compounds. We believe that this material is of little 
value in a beginning course and is better left to a course in organic chemistry.
•	 Qualitative analysis. This is summarized in a few pages in an essay in Chapter 15 in 
the Beyond the Classroom section. An extended discussion of the qualitative 
scheme and the chemistry behind it belongs in a laboratory manual, not a textbook.

xvi
•	 Biochemistry. This material is traditionally covered in the last chapter of gen-
eral chemistry texts. Although we have included several biochemical topics in 
the text (among them a discussion of heme in Chapter 19 and carotenoids in 
Chapter 6), we do not see the value of an entire chapter on biochemistry. Inter-
esting as this material is, it requires a background in organic chemistry that 
first-year students lack.
	 3.	 Avoid superfluous asides, applications to the real world, or stories about scien-
tists in the exposition of principles. We have incorporated many applications in 
the context of problems and some of the exposition of general principles. In 
general, however, we have stayed with a bare-bones approach. Students can eas-
ily be distracted by interesting but peripheral tidbits while they are striving hard 
to understand the core concepts. We have put some of our favorite real-world 
applications and personal stories about scientists in separate sections, Beyond 
the Classroom and Chemistry: The Human Side. Our students tell us that they 
read these two sections first and that these are the parts of the book that “we 
really enjoy the most.” (Talk about faint praise!) They do admit to enjoying the 
marginal notes too.
How Has the Seventh Edition Evolved?
The principles of general chemistry have not changed, but the freshmen taking the 
course have. We hope that if they compare the sixth to the seventh edition, they will say, 
“This revision is written for me. It talks to me and uses language and thinking that I am 
more familiar with.” (Perhaps few students would be that forthcoming, but we can hope 
anyway!) The changes that we decided to make for a texting, tweeting, and FacebookTM-
connected audience are to
•	 Change the approach of explaining examples. We have changed to a two-column for-
mat, using fewer words and showing step by step the analysis and thought processes 
that one should have when approaching quantitative problems. It is our expectation 
that as they repeatedly encounter the same analytical thought process in solving ex-
amples in the text, the students will employ that same process in solving other quan-
titative problems in their future science courses.
•	 Add flowcharts. We have delineated in a visual way (much like the algorithms stu-
dents are familiar with on their iPodsTM and iPhonesTM) a pathway to follow for vari-
ous topics. Among these are stoichiometry, naming compounds, and determining the 
acidity or basicity of a salt.
•	 Compile in tabular form data given in a problem. Students seem to grasp fairly well 
the complicated process of solving equilibrium problems. We believe this is because 
they have learned to organize the data in a table. We introduce them to a similar pro-
cess for the interconversion of concentration units and for the determination of the 
nature of a solution after acids and bases are combined.
•	 Combine complex ion equilibria with precipitation equilibria in Chapter 15 to fol-
low the discussion of gaseous, weak acid, weak base, and acid-base equilibria in 
Chapters 12–14. 
•	 Reorganize the discussion of solubility. We start with solubility and Ksp for a single 
solute in solution and go on to the effect of Ksp on reactions.
•	 Move the chapter on complex ions to follow nuclear chemistry. We heard from 
many instructors that when time is short, they cover the equilibria section of the 
complex ion chapter and skip the rest. Although we believe that coordination 
compounds are very important, we also think that discussing nuclear chemistry 
is far more useful when we are educating students to become informed citizens 
and voters.

PREFACE  
We are particularly grateful to Professor Fatma Selampinar (University of Connecti-
cut) for her accuracy reviews. Her thoroughness and absolute attention to detail are 
incredible.
Many people worked on the editorial and production team for this text. They took 
pages of manuscript, rough ideas, crude sketches, and long wish lists and put them to-
gether to create this edition. They prodded, cajoled, and set impossible deadlines. They 
dealt with the high frustration levels and the impatience of two strong-willed authors 
with grace and equanimity. They are:
Lisa Lockwood, Executive Editor
Alyssa White, Development Editor
Elizabeth Woods, Assistant Editor
Tanya Nigh, Senior Content Project Manager
Nicole Hamm, Marketing Manager
Cindy Geiss and Rhoda Bontrager of Graphic World, Inc.
Laura Bowen and Krista Mastroianni, editorial assistants at Cengage in Boston who 
facilitated many requests
Lisa Weber and Stephanie Van Camp, Media Editors
Special thanks to Rhoda Bontrager, Production Editor. She was the rock to which 
we clung on many frustrating, stormy days. Her professionalism and efficiency saw us 
through many crises.
Two people who do not belong to any team deserve special recognition. 
From EJN to Dr. Edmond J. O’Connell of Fairfield University: You have inspired my 
interest in teaching by the example of your own passion for teaching and mentoring. 
Thank you.
From CNH to Jim Hurley: You read drafts through a nonchemist’s (read mathemati-
cian’s) eye, checked the grammar of a non-native English speaker, and listened to endless 
complaints. Thank you for continuing on this journey.

To the Student
You’ve probably already heard a lot about your general chemistry course. Many think it 
is more difficult than other courses. There may be some justification for that opinion. 
Besides having its very own specialized vocabulary, chemistry is a quantitative science—
which means that you need mathematics as a tool to help you understand the concepts. 
As a result, you will probably receive a lot of advice from your instructor, teaching as-
sistant, and fellow students about how to study chemistry. We would, however, like to 
acquaint you with some of the learning tools in this text. They are described in the pages 
that follow.
Learning Tools in Chemistry: Principles 
and Reactions, Seventh Edition
Examples
In a typical chapter, you will find ten or more examples each designed to illustrate a par-
ticular principle. These examples are either general (green bars), graded (orange bars), or 
conceptual (blue bars). These have answers, screened in color. They are presented in a 
two-column format. Some examples are conceptual. Most of them contain three parts:
•	 Analysis, which lists 
1.	 The information given.
2.	 The information implied—information not directly stated in the program but 
data that you can find elsewhere. 
3.	 What is asked for.
•	 Strategy
This part gives you a plan to follow in solving the problem. It may lead you through 
a schematic pathway or remind you of conversion factors you have to consider or suggest 
equations that are useful.
•	 Solution
This portion shows in a stepwise manner how the strategy given is implemented.
•	 Many of the examples end with a section called End Points. These are either 
checks on the reasonableness of your answer or relevant information obtained 
from the problem.
You should find it helpful to get into the habit of working all problems this way.
Example 6.3    
Calculate the wavelength in nanometers of the line in the Balmer series that results from the transition n 5 4 to n 5 2.

TO THE STUDENT  
Graded Examples
Throughout the text, you will encounter special graded examples. Note that they are the 
problems with the orange bars. A typical graded example looks like the following:
STRATEGY
1. Substitute into Equation 6.4 to find the frequency due to the transition. 
     5 RH
h  a 1
nlo
2  2 1
nhi
2 b
Use the lower value for n as nlo and the higher value for nhi. 
2. Use Equation 6.1 to find the wavelength in meters and then convert to nanometers.

END POINT
Compare this value with that listed in Table 6.2 for the second line of the Balmer series.
example Graded
For the reaction
A 1 2B 9: C
determine
a  the number of moles of A required to react with 5.0 mol of B.
b  the number of grams of A required to react with 5.0 g of B.
c  the volume of a 0.50 M solution of A required to react with 5.0 g of B.
d  the volume of a 0.50 M solution of A required to react with 25 mL of a solution that has a density of 1.2 g/mL 
and contains 32% by mass of B.
There are two advantages to working a graded example:
	 1.	 By working parts (a) through (d) in succession, you can see how many different 
ways there are to ask a question about mass relations in a reaction. That should 
cushion the shock should you see only part (d) in an exam.
	 2.	 The parts of the graded example do not just progress from an easy mass relations 
question to a more difficult one. The value of the graded example is that the last 
question assumes the ability to answer the earlier ones. You may be able to answer 
parts (a) and (b) with a limited understanding of the material, but to answer part (d) 
you need to have mastered the material.
Use the graded example as you review for exams. Try to skip the earlier parts [in this case 
(a), (b) and (c)] and go directly to the last part (d). If you can solve (d), you do not need 
to try (a), (b), and (c)—you know how to do them. If you can’t, then try (c) to see where 
you may have a problem. If you can’t do (c), then try (b). As a last resort, start at (a) and 
work your way back through (d).

  TO THE STUDENT
Marginal Notes
Sprinkled throughout the text are a number of short notes in the margin. Many of these 
are of the “now, hear this” variety, others are mnemonics, and still others make points 
that we forgot to put in the text. (These were contributed by your fellow students.) 
Some—probably fewer than we think—are supposed to be humorous. 
Chemistry: The Human Side
Throughout the text, short biographies of some of the pioneers of chemistry appear in 
sections with this heading. They emphasize not only the accomplishments of these indi-
viduals but also their personalities.
Chemistry: Beyond the Classroom
Each chapter contains a Beyond the Classroom feature. It is a self-contained essay that 
illustrates a current example either of chemistry in use in the world or an area of chemi-
cal research. It does not intrude into the explanation of the concepts, so it won’t distract 
you. But we promise that those essays—if you read them—will make you more scientifi-
cally literate.
Chapter Highlights
At the end of each chapter, you will find a brief review of its concepts. A review is always 
helpful not only to refresh yourself about past material but also to organize your time 
and notes when preparing for an examination. The “Chapter Highlights” include
•	 The Key Terms in the chapter. If a particular term is unfamiliar, refer to the index at 
the back of the book. You will find the term in the glossary that is incorporated in the 
index and also the pages in the text where it appears (if you need more explanation).
•	 The Key Concepts and Key Equations introduced in the chapter. These are indexed to 
the corresponding examples and end-of-chapter problems. End-of-chapter problems 
available on OWL are also cross-referenced. If you have trouble working a particular 
problem here, it may help to go back and reread the example that covers the same 
concept.
Summary Problem
Each chapter is summarized by a multistep problem that covers all or nearly all of the key 
concepts in the chapter. You can test your understanding of the chapter by working this 
problem. A major advantage of the summary problems is that they tie together many 
different ideas, showing how they correlate with one another. An experienced general 
chemistry professor always tells his class, “If you can answer the summary problem with-
out help, you are ready for a test on its chapter.”
Questions and Answers
At the end of each chapter is a set of questions and problems that your instructor may 
assign for homework. They are also helpful in testing the depth of your knowledge about 
the chapter. These sets include
•	 Conceptual problems that test your understanding of principles. A calculator is not 
(or should not be) necessary to answer these questions.
•	 Questions that test your knowledge of the specialized vocabulary that chemists use 
(e.g., write the names of formulas, write the chemical equation for a reaction that is 
described).
•	 Quantitative problems that require a calculator and some algebraic manipulations.
Classified problems start the set and are grouped by type under a particular head-
ing that indicates the topic from the chapter that they address. The classified problems 
occur in matched pairs, so the second member illustrates the same principle as the first. 
This allows you more than one opportunity to test yourself. The second problem (whose 
number is even) is numbered in color and answered in Appendix 5. If your instructor 

xxiv
 
TO THE STUDENT  
assigns the odd problems without answers for homework, wait until the problem solu-
tion is discussed and solve the even problem to satisfy yourself that you understand how 
to solve the problem of that type.
Each chapter also contains a smaller number of Unclassified problems, which may 
involve more than one concept, including, perhaps, topics from a preceding chapter. 
The section of Challenge problems presents problems that may require extra skill 
and/or insight and effort. They are all answered in Appendix 5.
Blue-numbered questions answered in Appendix 5 have fully worked solutions 
available in the Student Solutions Manual. The Student Solutions Manual is described in 
more detail in the Preface. 
Appendices
The appendices at the end of the book provide not only the answers to the even-numbered 
problems but also additional materials you may find useful. Among them are 
•	 Appendix 1, which includes a review of SI base units as well as tables of thermody-
namic data and equilibrium constants.
•	 Appendix 3, which contains a mathematical review touching on just about all the 
mathematics you need for general chemistry. Exponential notation and logarithms 
(natural and base 10) are emphasized.

lmost certainly, this is your first college course in chemistry; perhaps it is your first ex-
posure to chemistry at any level. Unless you are a chemistry major, you may wonder 
why you are taking this course and what you can expect to gain from it. To address 
that question, it is helpful to look at some of the ways in which chemistry contributes to 
other disciplines.
If you’re planning to be an engineer, you can be sure that many of the materials you will 
work with have been synthesized by chemists. Some of these materials are organic (carbon-
containing). They could be familiar plastics like polyethylene ­(Chapter 23) or the more eso-
teric plastics used in unbreakable windows and ­nonflammable clothing. Other materials, in-
cluding metals (Chapter 20) and ­semiconductors, are ­inorganic in nature.
Perhaps you are a health science major, looking forward to a career in medicine or 
pharmacy. If so, you will want to become familiar with the properties of ­aqueous solu-
tions (Chapters 4, 10, 14, and 16), which include blood and other body fluids. Chemists 
today are involved in the synthesis of a variety of life-saving products. These range from 
drugs used in chemotherapy (Chapter 19) to new ­antibiotics used against resistant 
microorganisms.

chapter ONE  Matter and Measurements
Beyond career preparation, an objective of a college education is to make you a better-
informed citizen. In this text, we’ll look at some of the chemistry-related topics that make 
the news:
• depletion of the ozone layer (Chapter 11).
• alternative sources of fuel (Chapter 17).
• the pros and cons of nuclear power (Chapter 18).
Another goal of this text is to pique your intellectual curiosity by trying to ­explain the 
chemical principles behind such recent advances as
• “self-cleaning” windows (Chapter 1).
• “the ice that burns” (Chapter 3).
• “maintenance-free” storage batteries (Chapter 17).
• “chiral” drugs (Chapter 22).
We hope that when you complete this course you too will be convinced of the impor-
tance of chemistry in today’s world. We should, however, caution you on one point. Although 
we will talk about many of the applications of chemistry, our main concern will be with the 
principles that govern chemical reactions. Only by ­mastering those principles will you under-
stand the basis of the applications mentioned above.
This chapter begins the study of chemistry by
• considering the different types of matter: pure substances versus mixtures, elements 
versus compounds (Section 1.1).
• looking at the kinds of measurements fundamental to chemistry, the ­uncertainties asso-
ciated with those measurements, and a method to convert measured quantities from 
one unit to another (Section 1.2).
• focusing on certain physical properties including density and water solubility, which can 
be used to identify substances (Section 1.3). 
1.1 Matter and Its Classifications
Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. It can be classified either with re-
spect to its physical phases or with respect to its composition (Figure 1.1, page 3). 
The three phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A solid has a fixed shape and 
volume. A liquid has a fixed volume but is not rigid in shape; it takes the shape of its 
container. A gas has neither a fixed volume nor a shape. It takes on both the shape and 
the volume of its container.
Matter can also be classified with respect to its composition:
• pure substances, each of which has a fixed composition and a unique set of properties.
• mixtures, composed of two or more substances.
Pure substances are either elements or compounds (Figure 1.1), whereas mixtures can be 
either homogeneous or heterogeneous.
Elements
An element is a type of matter that cannot be broken down into two or more pure sub-
stances. There are 118 known elements, of which 91 occur naturally.
Many elements are familiar to all of us. The charcoal used in outdoor grills is nearly 
pure carbon. Electrical wiring, jewelry, and water pipes are often made from copper, a 
metallic element. Another such element, aluminum, is used in many household utensils.
Some elements come in and out of fashion, so to speak. Sixty years ago, ­elemental 
silicon was a chemical curiosity. Today, ultrapure silicon has become the basis for the 
multibillion-dollar semiconductor industry. Lead, on the other hand, is an element mov-
ing in the other direction. A generation ago it was widely used to make paint pigments, 
plumbing connections, and gasoline additives. Today, ­because of the toxicity of lead 
compounds, all of these applications have been banned in the United States.
In chemistry, an element is identified by its symbol. This consists of one or two 
letters, usually derived from the name of the element. Thus the symbol for carbon is C; 
that for aluminum is Al. Sometimes the symbol comes from the Latin name of the ele-
ment or one of its compounds. The two elements copper and mercury, which were 
Most materials you encounter are 
mixtures.
Chemistry deals with the properties 
and reactions of substances.

known in ancient times, have the symbols Cu 
(cuprum) and Hg (hydrargyrum).
Table 1.1 lists the names and symbols of 
several elements that are probably ­familiar to 
you. In either free or combined form, they are 
commonly found in the laboratory or in com-
mercial products. The abundances listed mea-
sure the relative amount of each element in the 
earth’s crust, the atmosphere, and the oceans.
Curiously, several of the most familiar ele-
ments are really quite rare. An ­example is mer-
cury, which has been known since at least 
500 b.c., even though its abundance is only 
0.00005%. It can easily be prepared by heating 
the red mineral cinnabar (Figure 1.2, page 4).
Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at 
room temperature. It is also one of the densest 
elements. Because of its high density, mercury 
was the liquid extensively used in thermome-
ters and barometers. In the 1990s all instru-
ments using mercury were banned because of 
environmental concerns. Another useful qual-
ity of mercury is its ability to dissolve many 
metals, forming solutions (amalgams). A silver-
mercury-tin amalgam is still used to fill tooth 
cavities, but many dentists now use tooth- 
colored composites because they adhere better 
and are aesthetically more pleasing.
In contrast, aluminum (abundance 5 7.5%), despite its usefulness, was little more 
than a chemical curiosity until about a century ago. It occurs in combined form in clays 
and rocks, from which it cannot be extracted. In 1886 two young chemists, Charles Hall 
in the United States and Paul Herroult in France, indepen­dently worked out a process for 
extracting aluminum from a relatively rare ore, bauxite. That process is still used today

to produce the element. By an odd coincidence, Hall and Herroult were born in the same 
year (1863) and died in the same year (1914).
Compounds
A compound is a pure substance that contains more than one element. Water is a com-
pound of hydrogen and oxygen. The compounds methane, acetylene, and naphthalene 
all contain the elements carbon and hydrogen, in different proportions.
Compounds have fixed compositions. That is, a given compound always ­contains 
the same elements in the same percentages by mass. A sample of pure ­water contains 
precisely 11.19% hydrogen and 88.81% oxygen. In contrast, mixtures can vary in compo-
sition. For example, a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen might contain 5, 10, 25, or 60% 
hydrogen, along with 95, 90, 75, or 40% oxygen.
The properties of compounds are usually very different from those of the elements 
they contain. Ordinary table salt, sodium chloride, is a white, unreactive solid. As you 
can guess from its name, it contains the two elements sodium and chlorine. Sodium

(Na) is a shiny, extremely reactive metal. Chlorine (Cl) is a poisonous, greenish-yellow 
gas. Clearly, when these two elements combine to form sodium chloride, a profound 
change takes place (Figure 1.3, page 4).
Many different methods can be used to resolve compounds into their elements. 
Sometimes, but not often, heat alone is sufficient. Mercury(II) oxide, a compound of mer-
cury and oxygen, decomposes to its elements when heated to 600°C. Joseph Priestley, an 
English chemist, discovered oxygen more than 200 years ago when he carried out this re-
action by exposing a sample of mercury(II) oxide to an intense beam of sunlight focused 
through a powerful lens. The mercury vapor formed is a deadly poison. Sir Isaac Newton, 
who distilled large quantities of mercury in his laboratory, suffered the effects in his later 
years.
Another method of resolving compounds into elements is electrolysis, which in-
volves passing an electric current through a compound, usually in the liquid state. By 
electrolysis it is possible to separate water into the gaseous elements ­hydrogen and 
oxygen. Several decades ago it was proposed to use the hydrogen ­produced by elec-
trolysis to raise the Titanic from its watery grave off the coast of Newfoundland. It 
didn’t work.
Mixtures
A mixture contains two or more substances combined in such a way that each substance 
retains its chemical identity. When you shake copper sulfate with sand (Figure 1.4), the 
two substances do not react with one another. In contrast, when sodium is exposed to 
chlorine gas, a new compound, sodium chloride, is formed.
There are two types of mixtures:
1.  Homogeneous or uniform mixtures are ones in which the composition is the 
same throughout. Another name for a homogeneous mixture is a solution, which is 
made up of a solvent, usually taken to be the substance present in largest amount, and 
one or more solutes. Most commonly, the solvent is a liquid, whereas solutes may be 
solids, liquids, or gases. Soda water is a solution of carbon dioxide (solute) in water (sol-
vent). Seawater is a more complex solution in which there are several solid solutes, in-
cluding sodium chloride; the solvent is water. It is also possible to have solutions in the 
solid state. Brass (Figure 1.5) is a solid solution containing the two metals copper (67%–
90%) and zinc (10%–33%).

chapter ONE  Matter and Measurements
2.  Heterogeneous or nonuniform mixtures are those in which the 
­composition varies throughout. Most rocks fall into this category. In a piece of 
granite (Figure 1.5, page 5), several components can be distinguished, differing 
from one another in color.
Many different methods can be used to separate the components of a mix-
ture from one another. A couple of methods that you may have carried out in the 
­laboratory are
• filtration, used to separate a heterogeneous solid-liquid mixture. The mixture 
is passed through a barrier with fine pores, such as filter paper. Copper sul-
fate, which is water-soluble, can be separated from sand by shaking with wa-
ter. On filtration the sand remains on the paper and the copper sulfate solu-
tion passes through it.
• distillation, used to resolve a homogeneous solid-liquid mixture. The liquid 
­vaporizes, leaving a residue of the solid in the distilling flask. The liquid is 
­obtained by condensing the vapor. Distillation can be used to separate the 
­components of a water solution of copper sulfate (Figure 1.6).
A more complex but more versatile separation method is chromatography, 
a technique widely used in teaching, research, and industrial laboratories to 
separate all kinds of mixtures. This method takes advantage of differences in 
solubility and/or extent of adsorption on a solid surface. In gas-liquid chroma-
tography, a ­mixture of volatile liquids and gases is introduced into one end of a 
heated glass tube. As little as one microliter (1026 L) of sample may be used. The 
tube is packed with an inert solid whose surface is coated with a viscous liquid. 
An unreactive “carrier gas,” often helium, is passed through the tube. The com-
ponents of the sample gradually separate as they vaporize into the helium or 
condense into the viscous liquid. Usually the more volatile fractions move faster 
and emerge first; successive fractions activate a detector and recorder. 
Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) (Figure 1.7) finds many applications 
outside the ­chemistry laboratory. If you’ve ever had an emissions test on  
the exhaust system of your car, GLC was almost certainly the analytical meth-
od used. Pollutants such as carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons

appear as peaks on a graph. A computer determines the areas under these peaks, 
which are proportional to the concentrations of pollutants, and prints out a series of 
numbers that tells the inspector whether your car passed or failed the test. Many of 
the techniques used to test people for drugs (marijuana, cocaine, and ­others) or alco-
hol also make use of gas-liquid chromatography.
In this section we will look at four familiar properties that you will almost ­certainly 
measure in the laboratory: length, volume, mass, and temperature. Other physical and 
chemical properties will be introduced in later chapters as they are needed.
Ultra high-speed gas chromatography (GC) fitted with an odor sensor is a powerful 
tool for analyzing the chemical vapors produced by explosives or other chemical or bio-
logical weapons.
1.2 Measurements
Chemistry is a quantitative science. The experiments that you carry out in the laboratory 
and the calculations that you perform almost always involve measured quantities with 
specified numerical values. Consider, for example, the following set of directions for the 
preparation of aspirin (measured quantities are shown in italics).
Add 2.0 g of salicylic acid, 5.0 mL of acetic anhydride, and 5 drops of 85% H3PO4 to a 50-mL 
Erlenmeyer flask. Heat in a water bath at 75˚C for 15 minutes. Add cautiously 20 mL of water 
and transfer to an ice bath at 0˚C. Scratch the inside of the flask with a stirring rod to initiate 
crystallization. Separate aspirin from the solid-liquid mixture by filtering through a Buchner 
funnel 10 cm in diameter.
Scientific measurements are expressed in the metric system. As you know, this is a 
decimal-based system in which all of the units of a particular quantity are related to one 
another by factors of 10. The more common prefixes used to express these factors are 
listed in Table 1.2.
Instruments and Units
The standard unit of length in the metric system is the meter, which is a little larger than 
a yard. The meter was originally intended to be 1/40,000,000 of the earth’s meridian that 
passes through Paris. It is now defined as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a 
second.
Other units of length are expressed in terms of the meter, using the prefixes listed in 
Table 1.2. You are familiar with the centimeter, the millimeter, and the kilometer:
1 cm 5 1022 m        1 mm 5 1023 m        1 km 5 103 m
The dimensions of very tiny particles are often expressed in nanometers:
1 nm 5 1029 m
Volume is most commonly expressed in one of three units
• cubic centimeters	
1 cm3 5 (1022 m)3 5 1026 m3
• liters (L)	
1 L 5 1023 m3 5 103 cm3

Notice that a milliliter is equal to one cubic centimeter:
1 mL 5 1 cm3
The device most commonly used to measure volume in general chemistry is the 
graduated cylinder. A pipet or buret (Figure 1.8) is used when greater accuracy is re-
quired. A pipet is calibrated to deliver a fixed volume of liquid—for example, 25.00 mL—
when filled to the mark and allowed to drain. Different volumes can be delivered accu-
rately by a buret, perhaps to 60.01 mL.
In the metric system, mass is most commonly expressed in grams, kilograms, or 
milligrams:
1 g 5 1023 kg        1 mg 5 1023 g
This book weighs about 1.5 kg. The megagram, more frequently called the metric ton, is
1 Mg 5 106 g 5 103 kg
Properly speaking, there is a distinction between mass and weight. Mass is a mea-
sure of the amount of matter in an object; weight is a measure of the ­gravitational force 
acting on the object. Chemists often use these terms interchangeably; we determine the 
mass of an object by “weighing” it on a ­balance (Figure 1.9).
Temperature is the factor that determines the direction of heat flow. When two ob-
jects at different temperatures are placed in contact with one ­another, heat flows from the 
one at the higher temperature to the one at the lower temperature.
Thermometers used in chemistry are marked in degrees Celsius (referred to as 
degrees centigrade until 1948). On this scale, named after the Swedish astronomer 
Anders Celsius (1701–1744), the freezing point of water is taken to be 0°C. The ­normal 
boiling point of water is 100°C. Household thermometers in the United States are com-
monly marked in Fahrenheit degrees. Daniel Fahrenheit (1686–1736) was a German 
instrument maker who was the first to use the mercury-in-glass ­thermometer. On this 
scale, the normal freezing and boiling points of water are taken to be 32° and 212°, re-
spectively (Figure 1.10). It follows that (212°F 2 32°F) 5 180°F covers the same tem-
perature interval as (100°C 2 0°C) 5 100°C. This leads to the ­general ­relation between 
the two scales:
	
t°F 5 1.8 t°C 1 32°	
(1.1)
The two scales coincide at 240°; as you can readily see from equation 1.1:
At 240°C:        t°F 5 1.8(240°) 1 32° 5 272° 1 32° 5 240°
For many purposes in chemistry, the most convenient unit of temperature is the 
kelvin (K); note the absence of the degree sign. The kelvin is defined to be 1/273.16 of the 
Many countries still use degrees 
centigrade.

Mercury thermometers have been phased out because of the ­toxicity of mercury vapor. A common replacement for

As you can see from this discussion, a wide number of different units can be used to 
express measured quantities in the metric system. This proliferation of units has long 
been of concern to scientists. In 1960 a self-consistent set of metric units was proposed. 
This so-called International System of Units (SI) is discussed in Appendix 1. The SI units

Uncertainties in Measurements: Significant Figures
Every measurement carries with it a degree of uncertainty. Its magnitude ­depends on the 
nature of the measuring device and the skill of its operator. Suppose, for example, you 
measure out 8 mL of liquid using the 100-mL graduated cylinder shown in Figure 1.11 
(page 10). Here the volume is uncertain to perhaps 61 mL. With such a crude measuring 
device, you would be lucky to obtain a volume ­between 7 and 9 mL. To obtain greater 
precision, you could use a narrow 10-mL cylinder, which has divisions in small incre-
ments. You might now measure a volume within 0.1 mL of the desired value, in the range 
of 7.9 to 8.1 mL. By using a ­buret, you could reduce the uncertainty to 60.01 mL.
Anyone making a measurement has a responsibility to indicate the uncertainty asso-
ciated with it. Such information is vital to someone who wants to repeat the experiment

or judge its precision. The three volume measurements referred to ­earlier could be re-
ported as
	
8 6 1 mL	
(large graduated cylinder)
	
8.0 6 0.1 mL	
(small graduated cylinder)
	
8.00 6 0.01 mL	
(buret)
In this text, we will drop the 6 notation and simply write
8 mL        8.0 mL        8.00 mL
When we do this, it is understood that there is an uncertainty of at least one unit in the 
last digit—that is, 1 mL, 0.1 mL, 0.01 mL, respectively. This method of citing the degree 
of confidence in a measurement is often described in terms of significant figures, the 
meaningful digits obtained in a measurement. In 8.00 mL there are three significant 
figures; each of the three digits has experimental meaning. Similarly, there are two sig-
nificant figures in 8.0 mL and one significant figure in 8 mL.
Frequently we need to know the number of significant figures in a measurement 
reported by someone else (Example 1.2).

ing volume. The uncertainty depends 
on the ­nature of the measuring device.

There’s a big difference between 8 mL  
and 8.00 mL, perhaps as much as half 
a milliliter.

1.2  Measurements
Sometimes the number of significant figures in a reported measurement is 
­ambiguous. Suppose that a piece of metal is reported to weigh 500 g. You cannot be 
sure how many of these digits are meaningful. Perhaps the metal was weighed to the 
nearest gram (500 6 1 g). If so, the 5 and the two zeros are significant; there are three 
significant figures. Then again, the metal might have been weighed only to the nearest 
10 g (500 6 10 g). In this case, only the 5 and one zero are known accurately; there are 
two significant figures. About all you can do in such cases is to wish the person who 
carried out the weighing had used exponential notation. The mass should have been 
reported as
5.00 3 102 g        (3 significant figures)
or
	
5.0 3 102 g	
(2 significant figures)
or
	
5 3 102 g	
(1 significant figure)
In general, any ambiguity concerning the number of significant figures in a measure-
ment can be resolved by using exponential notation (often referred to as “scientific nota-
tion”), discussed in Appendix 3.
Most measured quantities are not end results in themselves. Instead, they are 
used to calculate other quantities, often by multiplication or division. The precision 
of any such derived result is limited by that of the measurements on which it is 
based. When measured quantities are multiplied or divided, the number of 
­significant figures in the result is the same as that in the quantity with the smallest 
number of significant figures.
The rule is approximate, but ­sufficient 
for our purposes.
The number of significant figures is 
the number of digits shown when a 
quantity is expressed in ­exponential 
notation.
Unfortunately, the uncertainty here is 
uncertain.
A US Airways flight leaves Philadelphia in the early evening and arrives in Frankfurt 8.05 hours later. The airline distance 
from Philadelphia to Frankfurt is about 6.6 3 103 km, depending to some extent on the flight path followed. What is the

chapter ONE  Matter and Measurements
The rules for “rounding off” a measurement, which were applied in Example 1.3, are 
as follows:
	 1.	 If the digits to be discarded are less than – – 500   .  .  ., leave the last digit ­unchanged. 
Masses of 23.315 g and 23.487 g both round off to 23 g if only two significant digits 
are required.
 2. If the digits to be discarded are greater than – – 500  .  .  ., add one to the last digit. 
Masses of 23.692 g and 23.514 g round off to 24 g.
	 3.	 If, perchance, the digits to be discarded are – – 500  .  .  .  (or simply – – 5 by itself), 
round off so that the last digit is an even number. Masses of 23.500 g and 24.5 g both 
round off to 24 g (two significant figures).
When measured quantities are added or subtracted, the uncertainty in the ­result 
is found in a quite different way than when they are multiplied and divided. It is 
­determined by counting the number of decimal places, that is, the number of digits to 
the right of the decimal point for each measured quantity. When measured quantities 
are added or subtracted, the number of decimal places in the result is the same as that 
in the quantity with the greatest uncertainty and hence the smallest number of deci-
mal places.
To illustrate this rule, suppose you want to find the total volume of a vanilla latté 
made up of 2 shots of espresso (1 shot 5 46.1 mL), 301 mL of milk, and 2 tablespoons of 
vanilla syrup (1 tablespoon 5 14.787 mL).

1 mL
0 decimal place
Vanilla syrup
29.574 mL
	
0.001 mL
3 decimal places
Total volume
423 mL
Because there are no digits after the decimal point in the volume of milk, there are none 
in the total volume. Looking at it another way, we can say that the total volume, 423 mL, 
has an uncertainty of 61 mL, as does the volume of milk, the quantity with the greatest 
uncertainty.
In applying the rules governing the use of significant figures, you should keep in 
mind that certain numbers involved in calculations are exact rather than ­approximate. 
To illustrate this situation, consider the equation relating Fahrenheit and Celsius 
temperatures:
t°F 5 1.8t°C 1 32°
The numbers 1.8 and 32 are exact. Hence they do not limit the number of ­significant 
figures in a temperature conversion; that limit is determined only by the precision of the 
thermometer used to measure temperature.
A different type of exact number arises in certain calculations. Suppose you are 
asked to determine the amount of heat evolved when one kilogram of coal burns. The 
implication is that because “one” is spelled out, exactly one kilogram of coal burns. The 
uncertainty in the answer should be independent of the amount of coal.
Conversion of Units
It is often necessary to convert a measurement expressed in one unit to another unit in 
the same system or to convert a unit in the English system to one in the metric system. 
To do this we follow what is known as a conversion-factor approach or dimensional 
analysis. For example, to convert a volume of 536 cm3 to liters, the relation
1 L 5 1000 cm3
This way, you round up as often as you 
round down.
A number that is spelled out (one,  
two, . . .) does not affect the ­number  
of significant figures.

13
 
1.2  Measurements
is used. Dividing both sides of this equation by 1000 cm3 gives a quotient equal to 1:
1 L
1000 cm3 5 1000 cm3
1000 cm3 5 1
The quotient 1 L/1000 cm3, which is called a conversion factor, is multiplied by 536 cm3. 
Because the conversion factor equals 1, this does not change the actual volume. However, 
it does accomplish the desired conversion of units. The cm3 in the numerator and de-
nominator cancel to give the desired unit: liters.
536 cm3 3
1 L
1000 cm3 5 0.536 L
To convert a volume in liters, say 1.28 L to cm3, you must use a different form of the con-
version factor. Use the units as a guide. 
1.28 L 3 1000 cm3
1 L
5 1280 cm3 5 1.28 3 103 cm3
Notice that a single relation (1 L 5 1000 cm3) gives two conversion factors:
1 L
1000 cm3  and  1000 cm3
1 L
Always check the units of your final answer. If you accidentally use the wrong form of the 
conversion factor, you will not get the desired unit. For example, if in your conversion of 
1.28 L to cm3 you used the conversion factor 1 L/1000 cm3, you would get 
1.28 L 3
1 L
1000 cm3 5 1.28 3 1023  L2
cm3
In general, when you make a conversion choose the factor that cancels out the initial unit:
initial unit 3 wanted unit
initial unit 5 wanted unit
Conversions between English and metric units can be made using Table 1.3. We will 
call these “bridge conversions.” They allow you to move from one system to another.

Sometimes the required conversion has units raised to a power. To obtain the desired 
unit, you must remember to raise both the unit and the number to the desired power. 
Example 1.5 illustrates this point.

1.3  PROPERTIES OF SuBSTANCES
Taste is a physical property, but it is 
never measured in the lab.
1.3 Properties of Substances
Every pure substance has its own unique set of properties that serve to distinguish it 
from all other substances. A chemist most oft en identifi es an unknown  substance by 
measuring its properties and comparing them with the properties recorded in the chem-
ical literature for known substances.
Th e properties used to identify a substance must be intensive; that is, they must be 
independent of amount. Th e fact that a sample weighs 4.02 g or has a  volume of 229 mL 
The discussion in Section 1.2 emphasizes 
the importance of making precise numeri-
cal measurements. Chemistry was not 
always so quantitative. The following recipe 
for fi nding the philosopher’s stone was re-
corded more than 300 years ago.
Take all the mineral salts there are, also 
all salts of animal and vegetable origin. 
Add all the metals and minerals, omit-
ting none. Take two parts of the salts 
and grate in one part of the metals and 
minerals. Melt this in a crucible, 
forming a mass that refl ects the 
essence of the world in all its colors. 
Pulverize this and pour vinegar over it. 
Pour off  the red liquid into English 
wine bottles, fi lling them half-full. Seal 
them with the bladder of an ox (not
that of a pig). Punch a hole in the top 
with a coarse needle. Put the bottles in 
hot sand for three months. Vapor will 
escape through the hole in the top, 
leaving a red powder. . . .
One man more than any other trans-
formed chemistry from an art to a science. 
Antoine lavoisier was born in Paris; he died 
on the guillotine during the French 
 revolution. Above all else, lavoisier under-
stood the importance of carefully  controlled, 
quantitative experiments. These were de-
scribed in his book Elements of Chemistry.
Published in 1789, it is illustrated with dia-
grams by his wife.
The results of one of lavoisier’s quanti-
tative experiments are shown in Table A; 
the data are taken directly from lavoisier. If 
you add up the masses of reactants and 
products (expressed in arbitrary units), you 
fi nd them to be the same, 510. As lavoisier 
put it, “In all of the operations of men and 
nature, nothing is created. An equal 
 quantity of matter exists before and after 
the experiment.”
This was the fi rst clear statement of the 
law of conservation of mass (Chapter 2), 
which was the cornerstone for the growth 
of chemistry in the nineteenth century. 
Again, to quote lavoisier, “it is on this prin-
ciple that the whole art of making 
 experiments is founded.”

Lavoisier.

chapter ONE  Matter and Measurements
tells us nothing about its identity; mass and volume are ­extensive properties; that is, they 
depend on amount. Beyond that, substances may be identified on the basis of their
• chemical properties, observed when the substance takes part in a chemical reaction, 
a change that converts it to a new substance. For example, the fact that mercury(II) 
oxide decomposes to mercury and oxygen on heating to 600°C can be used to iden-
tify it. Again, the chemical inertness of helium helps to ­distinguish it from other, 
more reactive gases, such as hydrogen and oxygen.
• physical properties, observed without changing the chemical identity of a substance. 
Two such properties particularly useful for identifying a substance are
	
–melting point, the temperature at which a substance changes from the solid to the 
liquid state.
	
–boiling point, the temperature at which bubbles filled with vapor form within a liq-
uid. If a substance melts at 0°C and boils at 100°C, we are inclined to suspect that it 
might just be water.
In the remainder of this section we will consider a few other physical properties that 
can be measured without changing the identity of a substance.
Density
The density of a substance is the ratio of mass to volume:
	
density 5
mass
volume  d 5 mass
V 	
(1.3)
Note that even though mass and volume are extensive properties, the ratio of mass to 
volume is intensive. Samples of copper weighing 1.00 g, 10.5 g, 264 g, . . . all have the 
same density, 8.94 g/mL at 25°C.
For liquids and gases, density can be found in a straightforward way by measuring 
independently the mass (using a scale) and the volume (using a pipet or graduated cyl-
inder) of a sample. (Example 1.6 illustrates the process.)
Properties of gold. The color of gold 
is an intensive property. The quantity of 
gold in a sample is an extensive prop-
erty. The fact that gold can be stored in 
the air without undergoing any chemi-
cal reaction with oxygen in the air is a 
chemical property. The temperature at 
which gold melts (1063°C) is a physical 
property.
Charles D. Winters
Example  1.6
To determine the density of ethyl alcohol, a student pipets a 5.00-mL sample into an empty flask weighing 15.246 g. 
He weighs the flask with the sample and finds the mass to be 19.171 g. What is the density of the ethyl alcohol?

For solids, the mass of the sample can be obtained directly by weighing it. The vol-
ume of a regular solid (a cube, for example) can be calculated using the given dimen-
sions of the sample. The volume of an irregular solid, like a rock, is obtained by displace-
ment (Example 1.7).

Consider two samples of palladium (Pd), an element used in automobile catalytic converters. Sample A is a cylin-
drical bar with a mass of 97.36 g. The bar is 10.7 cm high and has a radius of 4.91 mm. Sample B is an irregular 
solid with a mass of 49.20 g. A graduated cylinder has 10.00 mL of water. When sample B is added to the

In a practical sense, density can be treated as a conversion factor to relate mass and

chapter ONe  Matter and Measurements
Figure 1.12 (page 22) shows the solubility of sugar in water as a function of tempera-
ture. Alternatively, we can say that it gives the concentration of sugar in a saturated
 solution at various temperatures. For example, at 20°C, we could say that “the solubility 
of sugar is 204 g/100 g water” or that “a saturated solution of sugar  contains 204 g/100 g 
water.”
At any point in the area below the curve in Figure 1.12, we are dealing with an un-
saturated solution. Consider, for example, point A (150 g sugar per 100 g  water at 20°C). 
Th is solution is unsaturated; if we add more sugar, another 54 g will dissolve to give a 
saturated solution (204 g sugar per 100 g water at 20°C).
The “100 g water” in the solubility 
 expression is an exact quantity.
When the temperature changes, the 
amount of solute in solution changes, 
but the mass of water stays the same.

1.3  PROPERTIES OF SuBSTANCES
At any point in the area above the curve, the sugar solution is supersaturated. Th is is 
the case at point B (300 g sugar per 100 g water at 20°C). Such a  solution could be formed 
by carefully cooling a saturated solution at 60°C to 20°C, where a saturated solution con-
tains 204 g sugar per 100 g water. Th e excess sugar stays in solution until a small seed 
crystal of sugar is added, whereupon crystallization quickly takes place. At that point the 
excess sugar

comes out of solution.
Arsenic
An element everyone has heard about but almost no one has ever seen 
is arsenic, symbol As. It is a gray solid with some metallic properties, 
melts at 816°C, and has a density of 5.78 g/ml. Among the elements, 
arsenic ranks 51st in abundance. It is about as common as tin or beryl-
lium. Two brightly colored sulfi des of arsenic, realgar and orpiment 
(Figure A), were known to the ancients. The element is believed to have 
been isolated for the fi rst time by Albertus Magnus in the thirteenth 
century. He heated orpiment with soap. The alchemists gave what they 
thought to be arsenic (it really was an oxide of arsenic) its own symbol 
(Figure B) and suggested that women rub it on their faces to whiten 
their complexion.
The principal use of elemental arsenic is in its alloys with lead. 
The “lead” storage battery contains a trace of arsenic along with 
3% antimony. lead shot, which are formed by allowing drops of 
molten lead to fall through the air, contains from 0.5 to 2.0% 
arsenic. The presence of arsenic raises the surface tension of the 
liquid and hence makes the shot more spherical.
In the early years of the twentieth century, several thousand 
organic compounds were synthesized and tested for medicinal use, 
mainly in the treatment of syphilis. One of these compounds, sal-
varsan, was found to be very eff ective. Arsenic compounds fell out 
CHEMISTry beYOND the claSSrOOM
of use in the mid-twentieth century because of the unacceptable 
side eff ects that occurred at the dosages that were thought to be 
necessary. In the 1970s, Chinese medicine tried a highly purifi ed 
oxide of arsenic in a low-dose regimen. It was shown to be eff ective 
in the treatment of some leukemias. Western medicine has con-
fi rmed these results. Molecular studies and clinical trials are 
ongoing and suggest that arsenic oxides show great promise in the 
treatment of malignant disease. 
Industry and farming have used arsenic compounds. However, 
because of its great toxicity and ability to leach into wells and streams, 
its is no longer produced in the United States, but it is still imported 
from other countries. Until the 1940s, arsenic compounds were used 
as agricultural pesticides. Today, most uses of arsenic in farming are 
banned in the United States, and its use as a preservative in pressure-
treated wood has been greatly reduced. 
The “arsenic poison” referred to in crime dramas is actually an 
oxide of arsenic rather than the element itself. less than 0.1 g of this 
white, slightly soluble powder can be fatal. The classic symptoms of 
arsenic poisoning involve various unpleasant gastrointestinal distur-
bances, severe abdominal pain, and burning of the mouth and throat.
In the modern forensic laboratory, arsenic is detected by analy-
sis of hair samples. A single strand of hair is suffi  cient to establish 
the presence or absence of the element. The technique most com-
monly used is neutron activation analysis, described in Chapter 18. 
If the concentration is found to be greater than about 0.0003%, 
poisoning is indicated.
This technique was applied in the early 1960s to a lock of hair 
taken from Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) on St. Helena. 
Arsenic levels of up to 50 times normal suggested he may have 
been a victim of poisoning, perhaps on orders from the French 
royal family. More recently (1991), U.S. President Zachary Taylor 
(1785–1850) was exhumed on the unlikely hypothesis that he had 
been poisoned by Southern sympathizers concerned about his op-
position to the extension of slavery. The results indicated normal 
arsenic levels. Apparently, he died of cholera, brought on by an 
overindulgence in overripe and unwashed fruit.

chapter ONE  Matter and Measurements
The crystallization of excess solute is a common problem in the preparation of can-
dies and in the storage of jam and honey. From these supersaturated solutions, sugar 
separates either as tiny crystals, causing the “graininess” in fudge, or as large crystals, 
which often appear in honey kept for a long time (Figure 1.13).

Questions and Problems
Blue-numbered questions have answers in Appendix 5 and fully worked 
solutions in the Student Solutions Manual.
  Interactive versions of these problems are assignable in OWL.
The questions and problems listed here are typical of those at the end of each 
chapter. Some are conceptual. Most require calculations, writing equations, or 
other quantitative work. The headings identify the primary topic of each set of 
questions or problems, such as “Symbols and Formulas” or “Significant ­Figures.” 
Those in the “Unclassified” category may involve more than one concept, in-
cluding, perhaps, topics from a ­preceding chapter. “Challenge Problems,” listed 
at the end of the set, ­require extra skill and/or effort. The “Classified” questions 
and problems (Problems 1–56 in this set) occur in matched pairs, one below the 
other, and illustrate the same concept. For ­example, Questions 1 and 2 are 
nearly identical in nature; the same is true of Questions 3 and 4, and so on.

o learn chemistry, you must become familiar with the building blocks that chemists 
use to describe the structure of matter. These include
• atoms (Section 2.1), composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons (Section 2.2) and 
their quantitative properties—atomic mass and atomic number (Section 2.3).
• molecules, the building blocks of several elements and a great many compounds. 
Molecular substances can be identified by their formulas (Section 2.5) or their names 
(Section 2.7)
• ions, species of opposite charge found in all ionic compounds. Using relatively simple 
principles, it is possible to derive the formulas (Section 2.6) and names (Section 2.7) of 
ionic compounds.
Early in this chapter (Section 2.4), we will introduce a classification system for elements 
known as the periodic table. It will prove useful in this chapter and throughout the remainder 
of the text.

2.1 Atoms and the Atomic Theory
In 1808, an English scientist and schoolteacher, John Dalton, developed the atomic mod-
el of matter that underlies modern chemistry. Th ree of the main  postulates of modern 
atomic theory, all of which Dalton suggested in a somewhat diff erent form, are stated 
below and illustrated in Figure 2.1.
1. 
An element is composed of tiny particles called atoms. All atoms of a given element 
have the same chemical properties. Atoms of diff erent elements show diff erent 
properties.
2. 
In an ordinary chemical reaction, atoms move from one substance to another, but no atom 
of any element disappears or is changed into an atom of another element.
3. 
Compounds are formed when atoms of two or more elements combine. In a given 
compound, the relative numbers of atoms of each kind are defi nite and  constant. In 
general, these relative numbers can be expressed as integers or  simple fractions.
On the basis of Dalton’s theory, the atom can be defi ned as the smallest  particle of 
an element that can enter into a chemical reaction.
2.2 Components of the Atom
Like any useful scientifi c theory, the atomic theory raised more questions than it an-
swered. Scientists wondered whether atoms, tiny as they are, could be broken down into 
still smaller particles. Nearly 100 years passed before the existence of subatomic particles 
was confi rmed by experiment. Two future Nobel laureates did pioneer work in this area. 
J. J. Th omson was an English physicist working at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cam-
bridge. Ernest Rutherford, at one time a student of Th omson’s (Figure 2.2), was a native 
of New Zealand. Rutherford carried out his  research at McGill University in Montreal 
and at Manchester and Cambridge in England. He was clearly the greatest experimental 
physicist of his time, and one of the greatest of all time.
Electrons
Th e fi rst evidence for the existence of subatomic particles came from studies of the conduc-
tion of electricity through gases at low pressures. When the glass tube shown in Figure 2.3 
is partially evacuated and connected to a spark coil, an electric current fl ows through it.

John dalton was a quiet, unassuming man 
and a devout Quaker. When presented to 
King William IV of England, dalton refused 
to wear the colorful court robes because 
of his religion. his friends persuaded him to 
wear the scarlet robes of oxford University, 
from which he had a doctor’s degree. 
dalton was color-blind, so he saw himself 
clothed in gray.
dalton was a prolifi c scientist who made 
contributions to biology and physics as well 
as chemistry. At a college in Manchester, 
England, he did research and spent as many 
as 20 hours a week lecturing in mathemat-
ics and the physical sciences. dalton never 
married; he said once, “My head is too full of 
triangles, chemical properties, and electrical 
experiments to think much of marriage.”
dalton’s atomic theory explained three 
of the basic laws of chemistry:
The law of conservation of mass: This 
states that there is no detectable change in 
mass in an ordinary chemical reaction. If 
atoms are conserved in a reaction (postu-
late 2 of the atomic theory), mass will also 
be conserved.
The law of constant composition: This 
tells us that a compound always contains 
the same elements in the same propor-
tions by mass. If the atom ratio of the ele-
ments in a compound is fi xed (postulate 3), 
their proportions by mass must also be 
fi xed.
The law of multiple proportions: This 
law, formulated by dalton himself, was 
crucial to establishing atomic theory. It 
applies to situations in which two elements 
form more than one compound. The law 
states that in these compounds, the masses 
of one  element that combine with a ﬁ xed 
mass of the second element are in a ratio 
of small whole numbers.
The validity of this law depends on the 
fact that atoms combine in simple, 
 whole-number ratios (postulate 3). Its rela-
tion to atomic theory is further illustrated 
in Figure A.

Associated with this fl ow are colored rays of light called cathode rays, which are bent by 
both electric and magnetic fi elds. From a careful study of this defl ection, J. J. Th omson 
showed in 1897 that the rays consist of a stream of negatively charged particles, which he 
called electrons. We now know that electrons are common to all atoms, carry a unit nega-
tive charge (21), and have a very small mass, roughly 1/2000 that of the lightest atom.
Every atom contains a defi nite number of electrons. Th is number, which runs from 
1 to more than 100, is characteristic of a neutral atom of a particular  element. All atoms 
of hydrogen contain one electron; all atoms of the element uranium contain 92 electrons. 
We will have more to say in Chapter 6 about how these electrons are arranged relative to 
one another. Right now, you need only know that they are found in the outer regions of 
the atom, where they form what amounts to a cloud of negative charge.

chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
Protons and Neutrons; the Atomic Nucleus
After J. J. Thomson discovered the negatively charged particles (electrons) in the atom, he 
proposed the structure of the atom to consist of a positively charged sphere with the nega-
tively charged electrons embedded in that sphere. It was known at the time to be the “plum 
pudding model.” Today, we would probably call it the “raisin bread model,” where the rai-
sins are the electrons distributed in the positively charged nucleus, the bread (Figure 2.4).
A series of experiments carried out under the direction of Ernest Rutherford in  
1911 shaped our ideas about the nature of the atom. He and his students bombarded a piece of 
thin gold foil (Figure 2.5) with a particles (helium atoms minus their ­electrons). With a fluo-
rescent screen, they observed the extent to which the a ­particles were scattered. Most of the 
particles went through the foil unchanged in direction; a few, however, were reflected back at 
acute angles. This was a totally unexpected result, inconsistent with the model of the atom in 
vogue at that time. In Rutherford’s words, “It was as though you had fired a 15-inch shell at a 
piece of tissue paper and it had bounced back and hit you.” By a mathematical analysis of the 
forces involved, Rutherford showed that the scattering was caused by a small, positively 
charged nucleus at the center of the gold atom. Most of the atom is empty space, which ex-
plains why most of the bombarding particles passed through the gold foil undeflected.
Since Rutherford’s time scientists have learned a great deal about the properties of 
atomic nuclei. For our purposes in chemistry, the nucleus of an atom can be considered 
to consist of two different types of particles (Table 2.1):
1.	
The proton, which has a mass nearly equal to that of an ordinary hydrogen atom. 
The proton carries a unit positive charge (11), equal in magnitude to that of the 
electron (21).
2.	
The neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass slightly greater than that of a proton.

2.3  QUANTITATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE ATOM
Because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, most of the mass of 
an atom (.99.9%) is concentrated in the nucleus, even though the ­volume of the nucle-
us is much smaller than that of the atom.
2.3 Quantitative Properties of the Atom
Atomic Number
All the atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in the ­nucleus. 
This number is a basic property of an element, called its atomic number and given the 
symbol Z:
Z 5 number of protons
In a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is exactly equal to the number 
of electrons outside the nucleus. Consider, for example, the elements ­hydrogen (Z 5 1) 
and uranium (Z 5 92). All hydrogen atoms have one proton in the nucleus; all uranium 
atoms have 92. In a neutral hydrogen atom there is one electron outside the nucleus; in a 
uranium atom there are 92.
	
H atom:	
1 proton, 1 electron	
Z 5 1
U atom:        92 protons, 92 electrons        Z 5 92
Mass Numbers; Isotopes
The mass number of an atom, given the symbol A, is found by adding up the number of 
protons and neutrons in the nucleus:
A 5 number of protons 1 number of neutrons
All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons, hence the same 
atomic number. They may, however, differ from one another in mass and therefore in 
mass number. This can happen because, although the number of ­protons in an atom of 
an element is fixed, the number of neutrons is not. It may vary and often does. Consider 
the element hydrogen (Z 5 1). There are three ­different kinds of hydrogen atoms. They 
all have one proton in the nucleus. A light hydrogen atom (the most common type) has 
no neutrons in the nucleus (A 5 1). ­Another type of hydrogen atom (deuterium) has one 
neutron (A 5 2). Still a third type (tritium) has two neutrons (A 5 3).
Atoms that contain the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons 
are called isotopes. The three kinds of hydrogen atoms just described are isotopes of that 
element. They have masses that are very nearly in the ratio 123. Among the isotopes of 
the element uranium are the following:

The composition of a nucleus is shown by its nuclear symbol. Here, the atomic 
number appears as a subscript at the lower left of the symbol of the ­element. The mass 
number is written as a superscript at the upper left.

Quite often, isotopes of an element are distinguished from one another by writing the 
mass number after the symbol of the element. The isotopes of uranium are ­often referred 
to as U-235 and U-238.

2.3  QUANTITATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE ATOM
Atomic Masses
Individual atoms are far too small to be weighed on a balance. However, as you will soon 
see, it is possible to determine quite accurately the relative masses of ­different atoms and 
molecules. Indeed, it is possible to go a step further and calculate the actual masses of 
these tiny building blocks of matter.
Relative masses of atoms of different elements are expressed in terms of their atomic 
masses (often referred to as atomic weights). The atomic mass of an ­element indicates 
how heavy, on the average, one atom of that element is ­compared with an atom of an-
other element.
To set up a scale of atomic masses, it is necessary to establish a standard value for 
one particular species. The modern atomic mass scale is based on the most common 
isotope of carbon, 126C. This isotope is assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units 
(amu):
mass of C-12 atom 5 12 amu (exactly)
It follows that an atom half as heavy as a C-12 atom would weigh 6 amu, an atom twice 
as heavy as C-12 would have a mass of 24 amu, and so on.
Isotopic Abundances
Relative masses of individual atoms can be determined using a mass spectrometer (Fig-
ure 2.6). Gaseous atoms or molecules at very low pressures are ionized by ­removing one 
or more electrons. The cations formed are accelerated by a potential of 500 to 2000 V 
toward a magnetic field, which deflects the ions from their straight-line path. The extent 
of deflection is inversely related to the mass of the ion. By measuring the voltages re-
quired to bring two ions of different mass to the same point on the detector, it is possible 
to determine their relative masses. For ­example, using a mass spectrometer, it is found 
that a 199F atom is 1.583 times as heavy as a 126C atom and so has a mass of
1.583 3 12.00 amu 5 19.00 amu
As it happens, naturally occurring fluorine consists of a single isotope, 199F. It follows 
that the atomic mass of the element fluorine must be the same as that of F-19, 19.00 amu. 
The situation with most elements is more complex, because they occur in nature as a 
mixture of two or more isotopes. To determine the atomic mass of such an element, it is 
necessary to know not only the masses of the individual isotopes but also their atom 
percents (isotopic abundances) in nature.

Fortunately, isotopic abundances as well as isotopic masses can be determined by 
mass spectrometry. The situation with chlorine, which has two stable isotopes, Cl-35 and 
Cl-37, is shown in Figure 2.7. The atomic masses of the two isotopes are determined in 
the usual way. The relative abundances of these isotopes are ­proportional to the heights 
of the recorder peaks or, more accurately, to the areas ­under these peaks. For chlorine, 
the data obtained from the mass spectrometer are

	 34.97 amu

      Cl-37

We interpret this to mean that, in elemental chlorine, 75.53% of the atoms have a 
mass of 34.97 amu, and the remaining atoms, 24.47% of the total, have a mass of 
36.97 amu. With this information we can readily calculate the atomic mass of chlorine 
using the general equation
atomic mass Y 5
 
1atomic mass Y12 3 % Y1
100% 1 1atomic mass Y22 3 % Y2
100% 1  . . . 
(2.1)
where Y1, Y2, .  .  . are isotopes of element Y.

100.0 1 36.97 amu 3 24.47
100.0 5 35.46 amu
Atomic masses calculated in this manner, using data obtained with a mass spec-
trometer, can in principle be precise to seven or eight significant figures. The accuracy of 
tabulated atomic masses is limited mostly by variations in natural abundances. Sulfur is 
an interesting case in point. It consists largely of two ­isotopes, 32
16S and 34
16S. The abundance 
of sulfur-34 varies from about 4.18% in sulfur deposits in Texas and Louisiana to 4.34% 
in volcanic sulfur from Italy. This leads to an uncertainty of 0.006 amu in the atomic 
mass of sulfur.
If the atomic mass of an element is known and if it has only two stable ­isotopes, their 
abundances can be calculated from the general equation cited above.

2.3  QUANTITATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE ATOM
The inside front cover or the opening pages of your text show the symbols of all the 
elements arranged in a particular way. This is called a periodic table. We will have more 
to say about this table in the next section (Section 2.4). For now, you can use it to find the 
element’s average atomic mass (rounded to four digits and written below the element’s 
symbol). Its atomic number, Z, is above the symbol.
Masses of Individual Atoms; Avogadro’s Number
For most purposes in chemistry, it is sufficient to know the relative masses of ­different 
atoms. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to go one step further and calculate the mass 
in grams of individual atoms. Let us consider how this can be done.
To start with, consider the elements helium and hydrogen. A helium atom is about 
four times as heavy as a hydrogen atom (He 5 4.003 amu, H 5 1.008 amu). It follows 
that a sample containing 100 helium atoms weighs about four times as much as a sample 
containing 100 hydrogen atoms. Again, comparing samples of the two elements contain-
ing a million atoms each, the masses will be in a 4 (helium) to 1 (hydrogen) ratio. Turn-
ing this argument around, it follows that a sample of ­helium weighing four grams must 
contain very nearly the same number of atoms as a sample of hydrogen weighing one 
gram. More precisely
no. of He atoms in 4.003 g helium 5 no. of H atoms in 1.008 g hydrogen
This reasoning is readily extended to other elements. A sample of any element with a 
mass in grams equal to its atomic mass contains the same number of atoms, NA, regard-
less of the identity of the element.
The question now arises as to the numerical value of NA; that is, how many atoms 
are in 4.003 g of helium, 1.008 g of hydrogen, 32.07 g of sulfur, and so on? As it happens, 
this problem is one that has been studied for at least a century. Several ingenious experi-
ments have been designed to determine this number, known as Avogadro’s number and 
given the symbol NA. As you can imagine, it is huge. (Remember that atoms are tiny. 
There must be a lot of them in 4.003 g of He, 1.008 g of H, and so on.) To four significant 
figures,
NA 5 6.022 3 1023
To get some idea of how large this number is, suppose the entire population of the 
world were assigned to counting the atoms in 4.003 g of helium. If each person counted 
one atom per second and worked a 48-hour week, the task would take more than 10 mil-
lion years.
If a nickel weighs twice as much as a 
dime, there are equal numbers of coins 
in 1000 g of nickels and 500 g of 
dimes.
Most people have better things to do.

x = 49% 
END POINT
The atomic mass of Br, 79.90, is just about halfway between the masses of the two isotopes, 78.92 and 80.92. So, it is  
reasonable that it should contain nearly equal amounts of the two isotopes.

chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
The importance of Avogadro’s number in chemistry should be clear. It ­represents 
the number of atoms of an element in a sample whose mass in grams is numerically 
equal to the atomic mass of the element. Thus there are
	
6.022 3 1023 H atoms in 1.008 g H	
atomic mass H 5 1.008 amu
	
6.022 3 1023 He atoms in 4.003 g He	
atomic mass He 5 4.003 amu
	
6.022 3 1023 S atoms in 32.07 g S	
atomic mass S 5 32.07 amu
Knowing Avogadro’s number and the atomic mass of an element, it is possible to 
calculate the mass of an individual atom (Example 2.3a). You can also determine the 
number of atoms in a weighed sample of any element (Example 2.3b).
EXAMPLE 2.3
Consider arsenic (As), a favorite poison used in crime stories. This element is discussed at the end of Chapter 1. Taking 
Avogadro’s number to be 6.022 × 1023, calculate
a  the mass of an arsenic atom.

2.4  Introduction to the Periodic Table
From a microscopic point of view, an element is a substance all of whose atoms have the 
same number of protons, that is, the same atomic number. The chemical properties of 
elements depend upon their atomic numbers, which can be read from the ­periodic table. 
A complete periodic table that lists symbols, atomic numbers, and atomic masses is  
given on the inside front cover or opening pages of this text. For our purposes in this 
chapter, the abbreviated table in Figure 2.8 (page 38) will ­suffice.
Periods and Groups
The horizontal rows in the table are referred to as periods. The first period ­consists of the 
two elements hydrogen (H) and helium (He). The second period starts with lithium (Li) 
and ends with neon (Ne).
The vertical columns are known as groups. Historically, many different ­systems 
have been used to designate the different groups. Both Arabic and Roman numerals have 
been used in combination with the letters A and B. The system used in this text is the one 
recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 
1985. The groups are numbered from 1 to 18, starting at the left.

38
 
chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
Elements falling in Groups 1, 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18* are referred to as main-
group elements. The ten elements in the center of each of periods 4 through 6 are called 
transition metals; they fall in Groups 3 through 12. The first transition series (period 4) 
starts with Sc (Group 3) and ends with Zn (Group 12).
The metals in Groups 13, 14, and 15, which lie to the right of the transition metals 
(Ga, In, Tl, Sn, Pb, Bi), are often referred to as post-transition metals.
Certain main groups are given special names. The elements in Group 1, at the far left 
of the periodic table, are called alkali metals; those in Group 2 are ­referred to as alkaline 
earth metals. As we move to the right, the elements in Group 17 are called halogens; at the 
far right, the noble (unreactive) gases constitute Group 18.
Elements in the same main group show very similar chemical properties. For 
example,
• lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) in Group 1 all react vigorously with 
water to produce hydrogen gas.
• helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) in Group 18 do not react with any other 
substances.
On the basis of observations such as these, we can say that the periodic table is an 
arrangement of elements, in order of increasing atomic number, in horizontal rows of 
such a length that elements with similar chemical properties fall ­directly beneath one 
another in vertical groups.
The person whose name is most closely associated with the periodic table is Dmitri 
Mendeleev (1836–1907), a Russian chemist. In writing a textbook of ­general chemistry, 
Mendeleev devoted separate chapters to families of elements with similar properties, 
including the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals, and the halogens. Reflecting on the 
properties of these and other elements, he ­proposed in 1869 a primitive version of to-
day’s periodic table. Mendeleev shrewdly left empty spaces in his table for new elements 
yet to be discovered. ­Indeed, he predicted ­detailed properties for three such elements 
(scandium, ­gallium, and germanium). By 1886 all of these elements had been discovered 
and found to have properties very similar to those he had predicted.
Metals and Nonmetals
The diagonal line or stairway that starts to the left of boron in the periodic table (Figure 
2.8) separates metals from nonmetals. The more than 80 elements­ to the left and below 
that line, shown in blue in the table, have the properties of ­metals; in particular, they 
Other periodic tables label the groups 
differently, but the elements have the 
same position.
Inert gases. Neon is used in advertis-
ing signs. The gas in tubes adds both 
color and light. The test kit is used to 
detect radon in home basements.

have high electrical conductivities. ­Elements above and to the right of the stairway are 
nonmetals (yellow); about 18 elements fit in that category.
Along the stairway (zig-zag line) in the periodic table are several elements that are 
difficult to classify exclusively as metals or nonmetals. They have properties ­between 
those of elements in the two classes. In particular, their electrical ­conductivities are in-
termediate between those of metals and nonmetals. The six ­elements

are often called metalloids.
Figure 2.9 shows the biologically important elements. The “good guys,” essential to 
life, include the major elements (yellow), which account for 99.9% of total body mass, 
and the trace elements (green) required in very small quantities. In general, the abun-
dances of elements in the body parallel those in the world around us, but there are some 
important exceptions. Aluminum and silicon, although widespread in nature, are miss-
ing in the human body. The reverse is true of carbon, which makes up only 0.08% of the 
earth’s crust but 18% of the body, where it occurs in a variety of organic compounds in-
cluding proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
The “bad guys,” shown in pink in Figure 2.9, are toxic, often lethal, even in relatively 
small quantities. Several of the essential trace elements become toxic if their concentra-
tions in the body increase. Selenium is a case in point. You need about 0.00005 g/day to 
maintain good health, but 0.001 g/day can be deadly. That’s a good thing to keep in mind 
if you’re taking selenium supplements.

chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
2.5 Molecules and Ions
Isolated atoms rarely occur in nature; only the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar,  .  .  .) consist of 
individual, nonreactive atoms. Atoms tend to combine with one ­another in various ways 
to form more complex structural units. Two such units, which serve as building blocks 
for a great many elements and compounds, are molecules and ions.
Molecules
Two or more atoms may combine with one another to form an uncharged ­molecule. The 
atoms involved are usually those of nonmetallic elements. Within the molecule, atoms 
are held to one another by strong forces called covalent bonds, which consist of shared 
pairs of electrons (Chapter 7). Forces between neighboring molecules, in contrast, are 
quite weak.
Molecular substances most often are represented by molecular formulas, in which 
the number of atoms of each element is indicated by a subscript written ­after the symbol 
of the element. Thus we interpret the molecular formulas for ­water (H2O), ammonia 
(NH3), and methane (CH4) to mean that in
• the water molecule, there is one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.
• the ammonia molecule, there is one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms.
• the methane molecule, there is one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.
The structures of molecules are sometimes represented by structural ­formulas, 
which show the bonding pattern within the molecule. The structural formulas of water, 
ammonia, and methane are
H—O—H
H—N—H
H
H—C—H
H

The dashes represent covalent bonds. The geometries of these molecules are shown in 
Figure 2.10.
Sometimes we represent a molecular substance with a formula intermediate be-
tween a structural formula and a molecular formula. A condensed structural for-
mula suggests the bonding pattern in the molecule and highlights the ­presence of a 
reactive group of atoms within the molecule. Consider, for example, the organic

the geometry of the molecules

found in intoxicating beverages such as beer and wine.

Elements as well as compounds can exist as discrete molecules. In hydrogen gas, the 
basic building block is a molecule consisting of two hydrogen atoms joined by a covalent 
bond:

chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
Ions
When an atom loses or gains electrons, charged particles called ions are formed. Metal 
atoms typically tend to lose electrons to form positively charged ions called cations (pro-
nounced cát-ahy-uhn). Examples include the Na1 and Ca21 ions, formed from atoms of 
the metals sodium and calcium:
Na atom 9: Na1 ion 1 e2
	
(11p1, 11e2)	
(11p1, 10e2)
Ca atom 9: Ca21 ion 1 2e2
	
(20p1, 20e2)	
(20p1, 18e2)
(The arrows separate reactants, Na and Ca atoms, from products, cations and ­electrons.)
Nonmetal atoms form negative ions called anions (pronounced án-ahy-uhn) by 
gaining electrons. Consider, for example, what happens when atoms of the ­nonmetals 
chlorine and oxygen acquire electrons:
Cl atom 1 e2 9: Cl2 ion
	
(17p1, 17e2)	
(17p1, 18e2)
O atom 1 2e2 9: O22 ion
	
(8p1, 8e2)	
(8p1, 10e2)
Notice that when an ion is formed, the number of protons in the nucleus is ­unchanged. 
It is the number of electrons that increases or decreases.
Metals form cations; nonmetals form 
anions; C, P, and the metalloids do not 
form monatomic ions.
We write 13 when describing the 
charge but 31 when using it as a 
superscript in the formula of an ion.

END POINT
A cation always contains more protons than electrons; the reverse is true of an anion. 
The ions dealt with to this point (e.g., Na1, Cl2) are monatomic; that is, they are 
derived from a single atom by the loss or gain of electrons. Many of the most important 
ions in chemistry are polyatomic, containing more than one atom. ­Examples include the 
hydroxide ion (OH2) and the ammonium ion (NH41). In these and other polyatomic 
ions, the atoms are held together by covalent bonds, for example,
(O—H) 

H—N—H

In a very real sense, you can think of a polyatomic ion as a “charged molecule.”
Because a bulk sample of matter is electrically neutral, ionic compounds ­always 
contain both cations (positively charged particles) and anions (negatively charged par-
ticles). Ordinary table salt, sodium chloride, is made up of an equal number of Na1 and 
Cl2 ions. The structure of sodium chloride is shown in Figure 2.12 (page 44). Notice that
• there are two kinds of structural units in NaCl, the Na1 and Cl2 ions.
• there are no discrete molecules; Na1 and Cl2 ions are bonded together in a ­continuous 
network.
Ionic compounds are held together by strong electrical forces between ­oppositely 
charged ions (e.g., Na1, Cl2). These forces are referred to as ionic bonds.
You can’t buy a bottle of Na1 ions.

chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
Typically, ionic compounds are solids at room temperature and have relatively high 
melting points (mp NaCl 5 801°C, CaCl2 5 772°C). To melt an ionic ­compound requires 
that oppositely charged ions be separated from one another, thereby breaking ionic bonds.
When an ionic solid such as NaCl dissolves in water, the solution formed ­contains 
Na1 and Cl2 ions. Since ions are charged particles, the solution conducts an electric cur-
rent (Figure 2.13) and we say that NaCl is a strong electrolyte. In contrast, a water solu-
tion of sugar, which is a molecular solid, does not conduct electricity. Sugar and other 
molecular solutes are nonelectrolytes.

2.6  FORMULAS OF IONIC COMPOUNDS
2.6 Formulas of Ionic Compounds
When a metal such as sodium (Na) or calcium (Ca) reacts with a nonmetal such as chlo-
rine (Cl2), the product is ordinarily an ionic compound. The formula of that compound 
(e.g., NaCl, CaCl2) shows the simplest ratio between cation and anion (one Na1 ion for 
one Cl2 ion; one Ca21 ion for two Cl2 ions). In that sense, the ­formulas of ionic com-
pounds are simplest formulas. Notice that the symbol of the metal (Na, Ca) always ap-
pears first in the formula, followed by that of the nonmetal.
To predict the formula of an ionic compound, you need to know the charges of the 
two ions involved. Then you can apply the principle of electrical neutrality, which re-
quires that the total positive charge of the cations in the formula must equal the total 
negative charge of the anions. Consider, for example, the ionic compound calcium chlo-
ride. The ions present are Ca21 and Cl2. For the ­compound to be electrically neutral, 
there must be two Cl2 ions for every Ca21 ion. The formula of calcium chloride must be 
CaCl2, indicating that the simplest ratio of Cl2 to Ca21 ions is 21.
Cations and Anions with Noble-Gas Structures
The charges of ions formed by atoms of the main-group elements can be predicted by 
applying a simple principle:
Atoms that are close to a noble gas (Group 18) in the periodic table form ions that contain 
the same number of electrons as the neighboring ­noble-gas atom.
This is reasonable; noble-gas atoms must have an extremely stable electronic struc-
ture, because they are so unreactive. Other atoms might be expected to ­acquire noble-
gas electronic structures by losing or gaining electrons.
Applying this principle, you can deduce the charges of ions formed by ­main-group 
atoms:
Group
No. of Electrons in Atom
Charge of Ion Formed
Examples
	
 1
1 more than noble-gas atom
11
Na1, K1
	  2
2 more than noble-gas atom
12
Mg21, Ca21
	
16
2 less than noble-gas atom
22
O22, S22
	
17
1 less than noble-gas atom
21
F2, Cl2
Two other ions that have noble-gas structures are
	
Al31	
(Al has three more e2 than the preceding noble gas, Ne)
	
N32	
(N has three fewer e2 than the following noble gas, Ne)

Once you deduce the formula of the ionic compound, it’s all downhill. ­Remember, though, that you have to show the  
relative numbers of cations and anions.

Cations of the Transition and Post-Transition Metals
Several metals that are farther removed from the noble gases in the periodic table form 
positive ions. These include the transition metals in Groups 3 to 12 and the post-transition 
metals in Groups 13 to 15. The cations formed by these metals ­typically have charges of 11, 
12, or 13 and ordinarily do not have noble-gas structures. We will postpone to Chapter 4 
a general discussion of the specific charges of cations formed by these metals.
Many of the transition and post-transition metals form more than one cation. Con-
sider, for example, iron in Group 8. This metal forms two different series of compounds 
with nonmetals. In one series, iron is present as a 12 cation
Fe21:    FeCl2, FeBr2,  .  .  .
In the other series, iron exists as a 13 cation
Fe31:    FeCl3, FeBr3,  .  .  . 
Polyatomic Ions
Table 2.2 lists some of the polyatomic ions that you will need to know, along with their 
names and charges. Notice that
• there are only two common polyatomic cations, NH41 and Hg221. All other cations 
considered in this text are derived from individual metal atoms (e.g., Na1 from Na, 
Ca21 from Ca,  .  .  .  ).
• most of the polyatomic anions contain one or more oxygen atoms; collectively these 
species are called oxoanions.
Nearly all cations are monatomic; the 
majority of anions are ­polyatomic.

2.7  NAMES OF COMPOUNDS
2.7 Names of Compounds
A compound can be identified either by its formula (e.g., NaCl) or by its name (sodium 
chloride). In this section, you will learn the rules used to name ionic and simple molecu-
lar compounds. To start with, it will be helpful to show how ­individual ions within ionic 
compounds are named.
Ions
Monatomic cations take the name of the metal from which they are derived. ­Examples 
include
Na1 sodium        K1 potassium
There is one complication. As mentioned earlier, certain metals in the transition and 
post-transition series form more than one cation, for example, Fe21 and Fe31. To distin-
guish between these cations, the charge must be indicated in the name. This is done by 
putting the charge as a Roman numeral in parentheses after the name of the metal:
Fe21 iron(II)        Fe31 iron(III)
(An older system used the suffixes -ic for the ion of higher charge and -ous for the ion of 
lower charge. These were added to the stem of the Latin name of the metal, so that the 
Fe31 ion was referred to as ferric and the Fe21 ion as ­ferrous.)
Monatomic anions are named by adding the suffix -ide to the stem of the name of 
the nonmetal from which they are derived.

chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
Polyatomic ions, as you have seen (Table 2.2), are given special names. Certain 
non­metals in Groups 15 to 17 of the periodic table form more than one ­polyatomic 
ion containing oxygen (oxoanions). The names of several such ­oxoanions are shown 
in Table 2.3. From the entries in the table, you should be able to deduce the following 
rules:
1.	
When a nonmetal forms two oxoanions, the suffix -ate is used for the anion with the 
larger number of oxygen atoms. The suffix -ite is used for the anion containing fewer 
oxygen atoms.
2.	
When a nonmetal forms more than two oxoanions, the prefixes per- (largest num-
ber of oxygen atoms) and hypo- (fewest oxygen atoms) are used as well.
Ionic Compounds
The name of an ionic compound consists of two words. The first word names the cation 
and the second names the anion. This is, of course, the same order in which the ions ap-
pear in the formula.
In naming the compounds of transition or post-transition metals, we ordinarily 
indicate the charge of the metal cation by a Roman numeral:
Cr(NO3)3    chromium(III) nitrate        SnCl2    tin(II) chloride

are named like those of chlorine.
Cl, Br, and I form more than two 
oxoanions.

metal; Cl2 5 chlorine → chloride; iron(II) chloride
In contrast, we never use Roman numerals with compounds of the Group 1 or Group 2 
metals; they always form cations with charges of 11 or 12, respectively.

chapter TWO  Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
Binary Molecular Compounds
When two nonmetals combine with each other, the product is most often a binary mo-
lecular compound. There is no simple way to deduce the formulas of such ­compounds. 
There is, however, a systematic way of naming molecular compounds that differs consid-
erably from that used with ionic compounds.
The systematic name of a binary molecular compound, which contains two different 
nonmetals, consists of two words.
1.	
The first word gives the name of the element that appears first in the formula; a 
Greek prefix (Table 2.4) is used to show the number of atoms of that element in the 
formula.
2.	
The second word consists of
• the appropriate Greek prefix designating the number of atoms of the second ele-
ment. (See Table 2.4.)
• the stem of the name of the second element.
• the suffix -ide.
To illustrate these rules, consider the names of the several oxides of nitrogen:
	
N2O5	 dinitrogen pentaoxide	
N2O3	 dinitrogen trioxide
	
N2O4	 dinitrogen tetraoxide	
NO	
nitrogen oxide
	
NO2	
nitrogen dioxide	
N2O	
dinitrogen oxide
When the prefixes tetra, penta, hexa,  .  .  . are followed by the letter “o,” the a is often 
dropped. For example, N2O5 is often referred to as dinitrogen ­pentoxide.
Many of the best-known binary compounds of the nonmetals have acquired com-
mon names. These are widely—and in some cases exclusively—used. ­Examples include
	
H2O	
water	
PH3	
phosphine
	
H2O2	 hydrogen peroxide	
AsH3	 arsine

2.7  NAMES OF COMPOUNDS
Acids
A few binary molecular compounds containing H atoms ionize in water to form H1 
ions. These are called acids. One such compound is hydrogen chloride, HCl; in water 
solution it exists as aqueous H1 and Cl2 ions. The water solution of hydrogen chloride is 
given a special name: It is referred to as hydrochloric acid. A similar ­situation applies with 
HBr and HI:

H1(aq), Cl2(aq)
Hydrochloric acid
HBr(g)
Hydrogen bromide
H1(aq), Br2(aq)
Hydrobromic acid
HI(g)
Hydrogen iodide
H1(aq), I2(aq)
Hydriodic acid
Most acids contain oxygen in addition to hydrogen atoms. Such species are ­referred 
to as oxoacids. Two oxoacids that you are likely to encounter in the ­general chemistry 
laboratory are
HNO3    nitric acid        H2SO4    sulfuric acid
The names of oxoacids are simply related to those of the corresponding oxoanions. 
The -ate suffix of the anion is replaced by -ic in the acid. In a similar way, the suffix -ite is 
replaced by the suffix -ous. The prefixes per- and hypo- found in the name of the anion 
are retained in the name of the acid.

  CHEMISTRY: BEYOND THE CLASSROOM
Ethyl Alcohol and the Law
There is a strong correlation between a driver’s blood alcohol con-
centration (BAC) and the likelihood that he or she will be involved 
in an accident (Figure A). At a BAC of 0.08% his or her chance of 
colliding with another car is four times greater than that of a sober 
driver.
Blood alcohol concentration can be determined directly by gas 
chromatography (Chapter 1). however, this approach is impractical 
for testing a driver on the highway. It requires that the suspect be 
transported to a hospital, where trained medical personnel can 
take a blood sample, then preserve and analyze it.
It is simpler and quicker to measure a suspect’s breath alcohol 
concentration (BrAc). This can be converted to BAC by multiplying 
by 2100; one volume of blood contains about 2100 times as much 
alcohol as the same volume of breath. In practice, this calculation is 
done automatically in the instrument used to measure BrAc; it 
reads directly the BAC of 0.05%, 0.08%, or whatever.
The fi rst instruments used by police to determine BrAc were 
developed in the 1930s. Until about 1980, the standard method 
involved adding K2Cr2o7, which reacts chemically with ethyl 
alcohol. potassium dichromate has a bright orange-red color, 
whose intensity fades as reaction occurs. The extent of the color 
change is a measure of the amount of alcohol present.
The standard instrument used in police stations today (Intoxi-
lyzer® 5000) measures infrared absorption at three wavelengths 
(3390, 3480, 3800 nm) where ethyl alcohol absorbs. At the 
ChEMISTRy beYOND the claSSrOOM
scene of an accident, a police 
oﬃ  cer may use a less accu-
rate 
handheld 
instrument 
about the size of a deck of 
cards, which estimates BAC 
by an electrochemical process 
(Chapter 17).
The greatest uncertainty in 
instruments such as the Intox-
ilyzer® lies in the conv ersion 
from BrAc to BAC values. The 
factor of 2100 referred to 
previously can vary consider-
ably depending on the circum-
stances 
under 
which 
the 
sample is taken. Simultaneous  measurements of BrAc and BAC 
values suggest that the factor can be anywhere between 1800 and 
2400. This means that a calculated BAC value of 0.100% could be 
as low as 0.086% or as high as 0.114%.
After drinking an alcoholic beverage, a person’s BAC rises to a 
maximum, typically in 30 to 90 minutes, and then drops steadily at 
the rate of about 0.02% per hour. The maximum BAC depends on 
the amount of alcohol consumed and the person’s body weight. 
The data cited in Table A are for male subjects; females show 
maximum BACs about 20% higher. Thus a man weighing 60 kg 
who takes three drinks may be expected to reach a maximum BAC 
of 0.09%; a woman of the same weight consuming the same 
amount of alcohol may show a BAC of
0.09% 3 1.2 5 0.11%

Chapter Outline
T
o this point, our study of chemistry has been largely qualitative, involving few calcula-
tions. However, chemistry is a quantitative science. From Chapter 2 we see that at-
oms differ from one another not only in composition (number of protons, electrons, 
neutrons) but also in mass. Chemical formulas, which we learned to write and name, tell us 
not only the atom ratios in which elements are present but also mass ratios. 
The general topic of this chapter is stoichiometry (stoy-key-OM-e-tree), the study of 
mass relations in chemistry. Whether dealing with molar mass (Section 3.1), chemical formu-
las (Section 3.2), or chemical reactions (Section 3.3), you will be answering questions that 
ask “how much?” or “how many?”. For example,
• how many grams of acid are needed to prepare a solution required for an experiment? 
(Section 3.1)
• how much iron can be obtained from a ton of iron ore? (Section 3.2)
• how much nitrogen gas is required to form a kilogram of ammonia? (Section 3.3)

3.1  THE MOLE
3.1 The Mole
People in different professions often use special counting units. You and I eat eggs one at 
a time, but farmers sell them by the dozen. We spend dollar bills one at a time, but Con-
gress distributes them by the billion. Chemists have their own counting unit, Avogadro’s 
number (Section 2.3).
The quantity represented by Avogadro’s number is so important that it is given a 
special name, the mole. A mole represents 6.022 3 1023 items, whatever they may be 
(Figure 3.1).
1 mol H atoms 5 6.022 3 1023 H atoms
1 mol O atoms 5 6.022 3 1023 O atoms
1 mol H2 molecules 5 6.022 3 1023 H2 molecules
1 mol H2O molecules 5 6.022 3 1023 H2O molecules
1 mol electrons 5 6.022 3 1023 electrons
1 mol pennies 5 6.022 3 1023 pennies
(One mole of pennies is a lot of money. It’s enough to pay all the expenses of the United 
States for the next billion years or so without accounting for inflation.)
A mole represents not only a specific number of particles but also a definite mass of 
a substance as represented by its formula (O, O2, H2O, NaCl,  .  .  .). The molar mass, 
MM, in grams per mole, is numerically equal to the sum of the masses (in amu) of the 
atoms in the formula.

18.02 g/mol
NaCl
22.99 amu 1 35.45 amu 5 58.44 amu
58.44 g/mol
Notice that the formula of a substance must be known to find its molar mass. It 
would be ambiguous, to say the least, to refer to the “molar mass of hydrogen.” One mole 
of hydrogen atoms, represented by the symbol H, weighs 1.008 g; the molar mass of H is 
1.008 g/mol. One mole of hydrogen molecules, represented by the formula H2, weighs 
2.016 g; the molar mass of H2 is 2.016 g/mol.
Mole-Gram Conversions
As you will see later in this chapter, it is often necessary to convert from moles of a sub-
stance to mass in grams or vice versa. Such conversions are readily made by using the 
general relation
	
mass 5 MM 3 n  
(3.1)
The mass is in grams, MM is the molar mass (g/mol), and n is the amount in moles. In 
effect, the molar mass, MM, is a conversion factor that allows you to calculate moles from 
mass or vice versa.

3.1  THE MOLE
We have now considered several types of conversions involving 
numbers of particles, moles,  and grams. They are summarized in Figure 
3.2. Conversions of the type we have just carried out come up over and 
over again in chemistry. They will be required in nearly every chapter of 
this text. Clearly, you must know what is meant by a mole. Remember, a 
mole always represents a certain number of items, 6.022 3 1023. Its mass, 
however, differs with the ­substance involved: A mole of H2O, 18.02 g, 
weighs considerably more than a mole of H2, 2.016 g, even though they 
both contain the same number of ­molecules. In the same way, a dozen 
bowling balls weigh a lot more than a dozen eggs, even though the num-
ber of items is the same for both.
Moles in Solution; Molarity
To obtain a given amount of a pure solid in the laboratory, you would 
weigh it out on a balance. Suppose, however, the solid is present as a 
solute dissolved in a solvent such as water. In this case, you ordinarily 
measure out a given volume of the water solution, perhaps using a graduated cylinder. 
The amount of solute you obtain in this way depends not only on the volume of solution 
but also on the concentration of solute, i.e., the amount of solute in a given amount of 
solution. The concentration of a solute in solution can be expressed in terms of its 
molarity:
	
molarity (M) 5 moles of solute
liters of solution	
(3.2)
The symbol [ ] is commonly used to represent the molarity of a species in solution. For a 
solution containing 1.20 mol of substance A in 2.50 L of solution,
[A] 5 1.20 mol
2.50 L  5 0.480 mol/L 5 0.480 M
One liter of such a solution would contain 0.480 mol of A; 100 mL of solution would 
contain 0.0480 mol of A, and so on.
The molarity of a soluble solute can vary over a wide range. With sodium ­hydroxide, 
for example, we can prepare a 6 M solution, a 1 M solution, a 0.1 M ­solution, and so on. 
The words “concentrated” and “dilute” are often used in a qualitative way to describe 
these solutions. We would describe a 6 M solution of NaOH as concentrated; it contains 
a relatively large amount of solute per liter. A 0.1 M NaOH solution is dilute, at least in 
comparison to 1 M or 6 M.

END POINT
The mass of the sample in grams is always larger than the number of moles because every known substance has a 
molar mass greater than 1 g/mol.
Almost every calculation that you will 
make in this chapter requires that you 
know precisely what is meant by a mole.

­ammonia in moles per liter.”

chapter Three  Mass Relations in Chemistry; Stoichiometry
To prepare a solution to a desired molarity, you first calculate the amount of solute 
required. This is then dissolved in enough solvent to form the required ­volume of solu-
tion. Suppose, for example, you want to make one liter of 0.100 M K2CrO4 solution (Fig-
ure 3.3). You first weigh out 19.4 g (0.100 mol) of K2CrO4 (MM 5 194.20 g/mol). Then 
stir with enough water to form one liter (1000 mL) of solution.
The molarity of a solution can be used to calculate
•	 the number of moles of solute in a given volume of solution.
•	 the volume of solution containing a given number of moles of solute.
Here, as in so many other cases, a conversion factor approach is used ­(Example 3.2).

made by adding enough water to 19.4 g of K2CrO4 to make one liter of solution. The weighed K2CrO4 (19.4 g) 
is transferred to a 1000-mL volumetric flask. Enough water is added to fully dissolve all of the solid by swirling. 
The final step is to shake the flask repeatedly until a homogeneous solution is formed.

chapter Three  Mass Relations in Chemistry; Stoichiometry
Knowing the molarity of a solution, you can readily obtain a specified amount of 
solute. All you have to do is to calculate the required volume, as in Example 3.2b. Upon 
measuring out that volume, you should obtain the desired number of moles or grams of 
solute. Concentrations of reagents in the general chemistry laboratory are most often 
expressed in molarities. We will have more to say about molarity and other concentra-
tion units in Chapter 10.

Figure 3.4 Charges of transition metal cations commonly found in aqueous ­solution.
As pointed out in Chapter 2, when an ionic solid dissolves in water, the cations and 
anions separate from each other. This process can be represented by a chemical equation 
in which the reactant is the solid and the products are the ­positive and negative ions in 
water (aqueous) solution. For the dissolving of MgCl2, the equation is
MgCl2(s) 9: Mg21(aq) 1 2Cl2(aq)
This equation tells us that one mole of MgCl2 yields one mole of Mg21 ions and two 
moles of Cl2 ions in solution. It follows that in any solution of magnesium chloride:
molarity Mg21 5 molarity MgCl2        molarity Cl2 5 2 3 molarity MgCl2
Similar relationships hold for ionic solids containing polyatomic ions (Table 2.2, page 
46) or transition metal cations (Figure 3.4).

chapter Three  Mass Relations in Chemistry; Stoichiometry
3.2 Mass Relations in Chemical Formulas
As you will see shortly, the formula of a compound can be used to determine the mass 
percents of the elements present. Conversely, if the percentages of the ­ele­ments are 
known, the simplest formula can be determined. Knowing the molar mass of a molecu-
lar compound, it is possible to go one step further and find the molecular formula. In 
this section we will consider how these three types of ­calculations are carried out.
Percent Composition from Formula
The percent composition of a compound is specified by citing the mass percents of the 
elements present. For example, in a 100-g sample of water there are 11.19 g of hydrogen 
and 88.81 g of oxygen. Hence the percentages of the two elements are
11.19 g H
100.00 g  3 100% 5 11.19% H   
88.81 g O
100.00 g  3 100% 5 88.81% O
We would say that the percent composition of water is 11.19% H, 88.81% O.
Knowing the formula of a compound, Fe2O3, you can readily calculate the mass 
percents of its constituent elements. It is convenient to start with one mole of compound 
(Example 3.4a). The formula of a compound can also be used in a straightforward way 
to find the mass of an element in a known mass of the ­compound (Example 3.4b).

The calculations in Example 3.4 illustrate an important characteristic of ­formulas. 
In one mole of Fe2O3 there are two moles of Fe (111.7 g) and three moles of O (48.00 g). 
This is the same as the atom ratio in Fe2O3, 2 atoms Fe  3 atoms O. In general, the sub-
scripts in a formula represent not only the atom ratio in which the different elements 
are combined but also the mole ratio.
Can you explain why the mole ­ratio 
must equal the atom ratio?

Simplest Formula from Chemical Analysis
A major task of chemical analysis is to determine the formulas of compounds. The for-
mula found by the approach described here is the simplest formula, which gives the 
simplest whole-number ratio of the atoms present. For an ionic compound, the simplest 
formula is ordinarily the only one that can be written (e.g., CaCl2, Cr2O3). For a molecu-
lar compound, the molecular formula is a whole-number multiple of the simplest for-
mula, where that number may be 1, 2,  .  .  .  .

The analytical data leading to the simplest formula may be expressed in various 
ways. You may know
•	 the masses of the elements in a weighed sample of the compound.
•	 the mass percents of the elements in the compound.
•	 the masses of products obtained by reaction of a weighed sample of the ­compound.
The strategy used to calculate the simplest formula depends to some extent on 
which of these types of information is given. The basic objective in each case is to find 
the number of moles of each element, then the simplest mole ratio, and ­finally the sim-
plest formula.
Figure 3.5 shows a schematic pathway for this process and Example 3.5 illustrates 
how a simple formula is obtained when the masses of the elements in the compound are 
given. The masses of the elements can also be calculated when the results of a combus-
tion experiment (discussed on page 71) are given.

3.2  MASS RELATIONS IN CHEMICAL FORMULAS
Sometimes you will be given the mass percents of the elements in a compound. If 
that is the case, one extra step is involved. Assume a 100-g sample and calculate the 
mass of each element in that sample.
Suppose, for example, you are told that the percentages of K, Cr, and O in a compound 
are 26.6%, 35.4%, and 38.0%, respectively. It follows that in a 100.0-g sample there are
26.6 g K, 35.4 g Cr, and 38.0 g O
Working with these masses, you can go through the same procedure followed in Exam-
ple 3.5 to arrive at the same answer. (Try it!)
The most complex problem of this type requires you to determine the simplest for-
mula of a compound given only the raw data obtained from its analysis. Here, an addi-
tional step is involved; you have to determine the masses of the elements from the masses 
of the new compounds that are obtained from the experiment.
Simple organic compounds such as hexane (containing C and H only) or ethyl alco-
hol (containing C, H, and O) can be analyzed using the apparatus shown in Figure 3.6. 
A weighed sample of the compound is burned in oxygen in a process called combustion. 
In combustion, the C in the compound is converted to CO2 while H is converted to H2O. 
The masses of CO2 and H2O can be determined by measuring the increase in mass of the 
absorbers. If oxygen is originally present, its mass is determined by difference.
mass O 5 mass of sample 2 (mass of C 1 mass of H)
To determine the mass of C (in CO2) and H (in H2O), recall that there is one atom of 
C (12.01 g/mol) in a molecule of CO2 (44.01 g/mol) and two atoms of H (2 3 1.008 g/mol) 
in a molecule of H2O (18.02 g/mol). Thus the following conversion factors apply:
For C: 
12.01 g C
44.01 g CO2
    For H: 
211.0082 g H
18.02 g H2O

formula would be A2B5C11. In general, multiply through by the smallest whole number that will give integers for all the

Molecular Formula from Simplest Formula
Chemical analysis always leads to the simplest formula of a compound because it gives 
only the simplest atom ratio of the elements. As pointed out earlier, the molecular for-
mula is a whole-number multiple of the simplest formula. That multiple may be 1 as in 
H2O, 2 as in H2O2, 3 as in C3H6, or some other integer. To find the multiple, one more 
piece of data is needed: the molar mass.
Sometimes it’s not so easy to ­convert 
the atom ratio to simplest formula 
(see Problem 39 at the end of the 
chapter).

3.3  MASS RELATIONS IN REACTIONS
3.3 Mass Relations in Reactions
A chemist who carries out a reaction in the laboratory needs to know how much product 
can be obtained from a given amount of starting materials (reactants). To do this, he or 
she starts by writing a balanced chemical equation.
Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations
Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, which identify ­reactants and 
products. Formulas of reactants appear on the left side of the equation; those of products 
are written on the right. In a balanced chemical equation, there are the same number of 
atoms of a given element on both sides. The same situation holds for a chemical reaction 
that you carry out in the laboratory; atoms are ­conserved. For that reason, any calcula-
tion involving a reaction must be based on the balanced equation for that reaction.
Beginning students are sometimes led to believe that writing a chemical equation is 
a simple, mechanical process. Nothing could be further from the truth. One point that 
seems obvious is often overlooked. You cannot write an equation ­unless you know what 
happens in the reaction that it represents. All the ­reactants and all the products must be 
identified. Moreover, you must know their ­formulas and physical states.
To illustrate how a relatively simple equation can be written and balanced, con-
sider a reaction used to launch astronauts into space (Figure 3.7). The reactants are 
two liquids, hydrazine and dinitrogen tetraoxide, whose molecular formulas are 
EXAMPLE 3.7
The molar mass of acetic acid, as determined with a mass ­spectrometer, is about 60 g/mol. Using that information

N2H4 and N2O4, respectively. The products of the reaction are gaseous nitrogen, 
N2, and water vapor. To write a balanced equation for this reaction, proceed as 
­follows:
1.  Write a “skeleton” equation in which the formulas of the reactants appear on 
the left and those of the products on the right. In this case,
N2H4 1 N2O4 9: N2 1 H2O
2.  Indicate the physical state of each reactant and product, after the formula, by 
writing
(g)	 for a gaseous substance
(l)	
for a pure liquid
(s)	
for a solid
(aq)	 for an ion or molecule in water (aqueous) solution
In this case
N2H4(l) 1 N2O4(l) 9: N2(g) 1 H2O(g)
3.  Balance the equation. To accomplish this, start by writing a coefficient of 4 for 
H2O, thus obtaining 4 oxygen atoms on both sides:
N2H4(l) 1 N2O4(l) 9: N2(g) 1 4H2O(g)
Now consider the hydrogen atoms. There are 4 3 2 5 8 H atoms on the right. To obtain 
8 H atoms on the left, write a coefficient of 2 for N2H4:
2N2H4(l) 1 N2O4(l) 9: N2(g) 1 4H2O(g)
Finally, consider nitrogen. There are a total of (2 3 2) 1 2 5 6 nitrogen atoms on the 
left. To balance nitrogen, write a coefficient of 3 for N2:
2N2H4(l) 1 N2O4(l) 9: 3N2(g) 1 4H2O(g)
This is the final balanced equation for the reaction of hydrazine with dinitrogen 
tetraoxide.
Three points concerning the balancing process are worth noting.
1.  Equations are balanced by adjusting coefficients in front of formulas, never 
by changing subscripts within formulas. On paper, the equation discussed above  
could have been balanced by writing N6 on the right, but that would have been ab-
surd. Elemental nitrogen exists as diatomic molecules, N2; there is no such thing as 
an N6 molecule.
2.  In balancing an equation, it is best to start with an element that appears in 
only one species on each side of the equation. In this case, either oxygen or hydro-
gen is a good starting point. Nitrogen would have been a poor choice, however, 
because there are nitrogen atoms in both reactant molecules, N2H4 and N2O4.
3.  In principle, an infinite number of balanced equations can be written for any 
reaction. The equations
4N2H4(l) 1 2N2O4(l) 9: 6N2(g) 1 8H2O(g)
N2H4(l) 1 1
2N2O4(l) 9: 
3
2N2(g) 1 2H2O(g)
are balanced in that there are the same number of atoms of each element on both sides. 
Ordinarily, the equation with the simplest whole-number ­coefficients
2N2H4(l) 1 N2O4(l) 9: 3N2(g) 1 4H2O(g)
is preferred.
Frequently, when you are asked to balance an equation, the formulas of products 
and reactants are given. Sometimes, though, you will have to derive the formulas, given 
only the names (Example 3.8).
Using the letters (s), (l), (g), (aq) lends a 
sense of physical reality to the equation.
6N is no good either.
It’s time to review Table 2.2 (page 46).

75
 
3.3  MASS RELATIONS IN REACTIONS
Mass Relations from Equations
The principal reason for writing balanced equations is to make it possible to relate the 
masses of reactants and products. Calculations of this sort are based on a very important 
principle:
The coefficients of a balanced equation represent numbers of moles of reactants and 
products.
To show that this statement is valid, recall the equation
2N2H4(l) 1 N2O4(l) 9: 3N2(g) 1 4H2O(g)
The coefficients in this equation represent numbers of molecules, that is,
2 molecules N2H4 1 1 molecule N2O4 9: 3 molecules N2 1 4 molecules H2O
A balanced equation remains valid if each coefficient is multiplied by the same number, 
including Avogadro’s number, NA:
2NA molecules N2H4 1 1NA molecule N2O4 9: 3NA molecules N2 1 4NA molecules H2O
Recall from Section 3.1 that a mole represents Avogadro’s number of items, NA. Thus 
the equation above can be written
2 mol N2H4 1 1 mol N2O4 9: 3 mol N2 1 4 mol H2O
EXAMPLE 3.8
Crystals of sodium hydroxide (lye) react with carbon dioxide from air to form a colorless liquid, water, and a white 
powder, sodium carbonate, which is ­commonly added to detergents as a softening agent. Write a balanced equation 
for this chemical ­reaction.
STRATEGY
1. Translate names to formulas and write a “skeleton” equation. Recall the discussion in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.
2. Write the physical states.
3. Balance by starting with an element that appears only once on each side of the equation.
4. Check that you have the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.

The quantities 2 mol of N2H4, 1 mol of N2O4, 3 mol of N2, and 4 mol of H2O are chemi-
cally equivalent to each other in this reaction. Hence they can be used in conversion 
factors such as
2 mol N2H4
3 mol N2
, 3 mol N2
1 mol N2O4
, or a variety of other combinations
These are also called stoichiometric ratios. Use the coefficients of the balanced equations 
for the ratios.
If you wanted to know how many moles of hydrazine were required to form 1.80 mol 
of elemental nitrogen, the conversion would be
nN2H4 5 1.80 mol N2 3 2 mol N2H4
3 mol N2
5 1.20 mol N2H4
To find the number of moles of nitrogen produced from 2.60 mol of N2O4,
nN2 5 2.60 mol N2O4 3
3 mol N2
1 mol N2O4
5 7.80 mol N2
Simple mole relationships of this type are readily extended to relate moles of one 
substance to grams of another or grams of one substance to moles or ­molecules of an-
other (Example 3.9). A schematic pathway that you can follow is shown in Figure 3.8.

Limiting Reactant and Theoretical Yield
When the two elements antimony and iodine are heated in contact with one ­another 
(Figure 3.9), they react to form antimony(III) iodide.
2Sb(s) 1 3I2(s) 9: 2SbI3(s)
The coefficients in this equation show that two moles of Sb (243.6 g) react with ­exactly 
three moles of I2 (761.4 g) to form two moles of SbI3 (1005.0 g). Put another way, the 
maximum quantity of SbI3 that can be obtained under these conditions, assuming the 
reaction goes to completion and no product is lost, is 1005.0 g. This quantity is referred 
to as the theoretical yield of SbI3.
Ordinarily, in the laboratory, reactants are not mixed in exactly the ratio ­required 
for reaction. Instead, an excess of one reactant, usually the cheaper one, is used. For ex-
ample, 3.00 mol of Sb could be mixed with 3.00 mol of I2. In that case, after the reaction 
is over, 1.00 mol of Sb remains unreacted.

The 3.00 mol of I2 should be completely consumed in forming the 2.00 mol of SbI3:
nSbI3 formed 5 3.00 mol I2 3 2 mol SbI3
3 mol I2
5 2.00 mol SbI3
After the reaction is over, the solid obtained would be a mixture of product, 2.00 mol of 
SbI3, with 1.00 mol of unreacted Sb.
In situations such as this, a distinction is made between the excess reactant (Sb) and 
the limiting reactant, I2. The amount of product formed is determined (limited) by the 
amount of limiting reactant. With 3.00 mol of I2, only 2.00 mol of SbI3 is obtained, re-
gardless of how large an excess of Sb is used.
Under these conditions, the theoretical yield of product is the amount produced if 
the limiting reactant is completely consumed. In the case just cited, the theoretical yield 
of SbI3 is 2.00 mol, the amount formed from the limiting ­reactant, I2.
Often you will be given the amounts of two different reactants and asked to deter-
mine which is the limiting reactant, to calculate the theoretical yield of the product and 
to find how much of the excess reactant is unused. To do so, it helps to ­follow a system-
atic, four-step procedure.
	 1.	 Calculate the amount of product that would be formed if the first reactant were 
completely consumed.
 2. Repeat this calculation for the second reactant; that is, calculate how much product 
would be formed if all of that reactant were consumed.
 3. Choose the smaller of the two amounts calculated in (1) and (2). This is the theoretical 
yield of product; the reactant that produces the smaller amount is the limiting reac-
tant. The other reactant is in excess; only part of it is ­consumed.
	 4.	 Take the theoretical yield of the product and determine how much of the ­reactant 
in excess is used up in the reaction. Subtract that from the starting amount to find 
the amount left.
To illustrate how this procedure works, suppose you want to make grilled cheese sand-
wiches from 6 slices of cheese and 18 pieces of bread. The available cheese is enough for  
6 grilled cheese sandwiches; the bread is enough for 9. Clearly, the cheese is the limiting 
reactant; there is an excess of bread. The ­theoretical yield is 6 sandwiches. Six grilled cheese 
sandwiches use up 12 slices of bread. Since there are 18 pieces available, 6 pieces of bread are 
left over.
Grilled cheese sandwiches are the fa-
vorite comfort food of WLM and CNH.

3.3  MASS RELATIONS IN REACTIONS
Remember that in deciding on the theoretical yield of product, you choose the 
smaller of the two calculated amounts. To see why this must be the case, refer back to 
Example 3.10b. There, 1.20 g of Sb was mixed with 2.40 g of I2. Calculations show that the 
theoretical yield of SbI3 is 3.17 g, and 0.43 g of Sb is left over. Thus
1.20 g Sb 1 2.40 g I2 9: 3.17 g SbI3 1 0.43 g Sb
This makes sense: 3.60 g of reactants yield a total of 3.60 g of products, including the 
unreacted antimony. Suppose, however, that 4.95 g of SbI3 were chosen as the theoretical 
yield. The following nonsensical situation would arise.
1.20 g Sb 1 2.40 g I2 9: 4.95 g SbI3
This violates the law of conservation of mass; 3.60 g of reactants cannot form 4.95 g of 
product.
Experimental Yield; Percent Yield
The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product that can be ­obtained. In cal-
culating the theoretical yield, it is assumed that the limiting ­reactant is 100% converted 
to product. In the real world, that is unlikely to happen. Some of the limiting reactant 
may be consumed in competing reactions. Some of the product may be lost in separat-
ing it from the reaction mixture. For these and other reasons, the experimental yield is 
ordinarily less than the theoretical yield. Put another way, the percent yield is ex-
pected to be less than 100%:
	
percent yield 5
experimental yield
theoretical yield
3 100%
	
(3.3)
Percent yield. If you started with 
20 popcorn kernels, but only 16 of 
them popped, the percent yield of 
popcorn from this “reaction” would be 
16/20 3 100% 5 80%.
Charles D. Winters
You never do quite as well as you 
hoped, so you never get 100%.
Remember the 6 grilled cheese 
­sandwiches on page 79? If your dog 
ate one of them while you weren’t 
looking, your yield would be 83%.
EXAMPLE 3.11
Consider again the reaction discussed in Example 3.10:
    2Sb(s) 1 3I2(s) 9: 2SbI3(s)
Suppose that in part (a) the percent yield is 78.2%. How many grams of SbI3 are formed?

Hydrates
ionic compounds often separate from water solution with mole-
cules of water  incorporated into the solid. Such compounds are 
referred to as hydrates. an example is hydrated copper sulfate, 
which contains fi ve moles of H2O for every mole of CuSO4. its 
formula is CuSO4 ? 5H2O; a dot is used to separate the formulas of 
the two compounds CuSO4 and H2O. a Greek prefi x is used to 
show the number of moles of water; the  systematic name of 
CuSO4 ? 5H2O is copper(ii) sulfate pentahydrate.
Certain hydrates, notably na2CO3 ? 10H2O and FeSO4 ? 7H2O, lose 
all or part of their water of hydration when exposed to dry air. This 
process is referred to as 
eﬄ  orescence; the glassy 
(vitreous) hydrate crys-
tals crumble to a powder. 
Frequently, dehydration 
is accompanied by a 
color change (Figure a). 
When 
CoCl2 ? 6H2O 
is 
exposed to dry air or is 
heated, it loses water 
and changes color from 
red to purple or blue. 
Crystals of this com-
pound are used as hu-
midity indicators and as 
an ingredient of invisible 
ink.

form hydrates, but of an entirely diff erent nature. in these crys-
tals, sometimes referred to as clathrates, a molecule (such as 
CH4, CHCl3) is quite literally trapped in an ice-like cage of water 
molecules. Perhaps the  best-known molecular hydrate is that of 
chlorine, which has the approximate composition Cl2 ? 7.3H2O. 
This compound was discovered by the great English physicist 
and  electrochemist Michael Faraday in 1823. you can make it by 
bubbling chlorine gas through calcium chloride solution at 0°C; 
the hydrate comes down as feathery white crystals. in the winter 
of 1914, the German army used chlorine in chemical warfare on 
the russian front against the soldiers of the Tsar. They were 
puzzled by its ineff ectiveness; not until spring was deadly chlo-
rine gas liberated from the hydrate, which is stable at cold 
temperatures.
in the 1930s when 
high-pressure natural gas 
(95% methane) pipelines 
were being built in the 
united States, it was found 
that 
the 
lines 
often 
became plugged in cold 
weather by a white, waxy 
solid that contained both 
water and methane (CH4) 
 molecules. Twenty years 
later, Walter Claussen at 
the university of illinois 
deduced the structure of 
that solid, a hydrate of 
methane. notice (Figure 
B) that CH4 molecules are 
trapped within a three-di-
mensional cage of H2O 
molecules.
Figure B In one of the cages within 
which gas molecules are trapped in 
methane hydrate, water molecules 
form a pentagonal dodecahedron, 
a three-dimensional  ﬁ gure in which 
each of the 12 sides is a  regular 
pentagon.

  KEY TERMS
In 1970 a huge deposit of methane hydrate was discovered at 
the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, 330 km off the coast of North 
Carolina. The white solid was stable at the high pressure and low 
temperature (slightly above 0°C) that prevail at the ocean floor. 
When raised to the surface, the solid decomposed to give off 
copious amounts of methane gas (Figure C).
We now know that methane hydrate is widely distributed through 
the earth’s oceans and the permafrost of Alaska and Siberia. The 
methane in these deposits could, upon combustion, produce twice as 
much energy as all the world’s known resources of petroleum, natural 
gas, and coal. However, extracting the methane from undersea 
­deposits has proved to be an engineering nightmare. Separating the 
hydrate from the mud, silt, and rocks with which it is mixed is almost 
as difficult as controlling its ­decomposition. Then there is the problem 
of transporting the methane to the shore, which may be 100 miles or 
more away.
Figure C Methane 
hydrate is sometimes 
referred to as “the ice 
that burns.”

ost of the reactions considered in Chapter 3 involved pure substances ­reacting with 
each other. However, most of the reactions you will carry out in the laboratory or 
hear about in lecture take place in water ­(aqueous) solution. Beyond that, most of 
the reactions that occur in the world around you involve ions or molecules dissolved in wa-
ter. For these reasons, among others, you need to become familiar with some of the more 
important types of aqueous reactions. These include
• precipitation reactions (Section 4.1).
• acid-base reactions (Section 4.2).
• oxidation-reduction reactions (Section 4.3).
The emphasis is on writing and balancing chemical equations for these reactions. All of 
these reactions involve ions in solution. The corresponding equations are given a special 
name: net ionic equations. They can be used to do stoichiometric calculations similar to 
those discussed in Chapter 3.
To carry out these calculations for solution reactions, recall the concentration unit 
called molarity (Section 3.1), which tells you how many moles of a species are in a given 
volume of solution.

4.1 Precipitation Reactions
When water (aqueous) solutions of two different ionic compounds are mixed, we often 
find that an insoluble solid precipitates. To identify the solid, we must know which ionic 
compounds are soluble in water and which are not.
Solubility of Ionic Compounds
When an ionic solid dissolves in water two competing forces come into play:
•	 the attractive forces between the oppositely charged ions making up the solid
•	 the attractive forces between water and the ions.
For reasons discussed later in this text (Chapter 7), water has two partially positively 
charged (d1) hydrogen atoms (attractive to anions) and a partially negatively charged 
(d2) oxygen atom (attractive to cations). The extent to which solution occurs depends 
upon a balance between two forces, which are both electrical in nature:
	 1.	 The force of atraction between H2O molecules and the ions of the solid, 
which tends to bring the solid into solution. If this factor predominates, we 
expect the compound to be very soluble in water, as in the case of KCl 
(Figure 4.1).
	 2.	 The force of attraction between oppositely charged ions, which tends to 
keep them in the solid state. If this is the major factor, we expect water 
solubility to be low. SrSO4 is almost insoluble, which implies that the inter-
ionic forces between Sr21 ions and SO422 ions predominate.
Unfortunately, we cannot determine from first principles the relative 
strengths of these two forces for a given solid. For this reason, among others, we 
cannot predict in advance the water solubilities of ionic solids, which cover an enormous 
range of possibilities.
At one extreme, we have the white solid lithium chlorate, LiClO3, which dissolves to 
the extent of 35 mol/L at room temperature. Mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, found in nature in 
the red mineral cinnabar, is at the other extreme. Its calculated solubility at 258C is 
10226 mol/L. This means that, in principle at least, about 200 L of a solution of HgS would 
be required to contain a single pair of Hg21 and S22 ions.
Information on the solubility of common ionic solids in the form of a solubility dia-
gram is given in Figure 4.2.
These rules are quite simple to interpret. For example, the following facts should be 
evident from Figure 4.2:
•	 Ni(NO3)2 is soluble. (All nitrates are soluble.)
•	 CoCl2 is soluble. (It is not one of the three insoluble chlorides listed.)
•	 PbCO3 is insoluble.

chapter Four  Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Sometimes when water solutions of two different ionic compounds are mixed, an insol-
uble solid separates out of solution. The precipitate (abbreviation: ppt) that forms is it-
self ionic; the cation comes from one solution, the anion from the other. To predict the 
occurrence of reactions of this type, you must know which ionic substances are insoluble 
in water.
The precipitation diagram shown in Figure 4.2 (page 91) and the schematic diagram 
(Figure 4.3) enable you to determine whether or not a precipitate will form when dilute 
solutions of two ionic solutes are mixed. If a cation in solution 1 mixes with an anion in 
solution 2 to form an ­insoluble compound (colored squares), that compound will precipi-
tate. Cation-­anion combinations that lead to the formation of a soluble compound (white 
squares) will not give a precipitate. For example, if solutions of NiCl2 (Ni21, Cl2 ions) and 
NaOH (Na1, OH2 ions) are mixed (Figure 4.4)
•	 a precipitate of Ni(OH)2, an insoluble compound, will form.
•	 NaCl, a soluble compound, will not precipitate.

Net Ionic Equations
The precipitation reaction that occurs when solutions of Na2CO3 and CaCl2 are mixed 
(Figure 4.5) can be represented by a simple equation. To obtain that ­equation, consider 
the identity of the reactants and products:
Reactants:    Na1, CO322, Ca21, and Cl2 ions in water solution:
2Na1(aq) 1 CO322(aq) 1 Ca21(aq) 1 2Cl2(aq)
Products:    solid CaCO3, Na1 and Cl2 ions remaining in solution:
2Na1(aq) 1 2Cl2(aq) 1 CaCO3(s)
The total ionic equation for the reaction is
2Na1(aq) 1 CO322(aq) 1 Ca21(aq) 1 2Cl2(aq) 9: 
2Na1(aq) 1 2Cl2(aq) 1 CaCO3(s)
Canceling out the ions that appear on both sides of the equation (2Na1, 2Cl2), we obtain 
the final equation:
Ca21(aq) 1 CO322(aq) 9: CaCO3(s)
Equations such as this that exclude “spectator ions,” which take no part in the reaction, 
are referred to as net ionic equations. We will use net ionic equations throughout this 
chapter and indeed the entire text to represent a wide variety of reactions in water solu-
tion. Like all equations, net ionic equations must show
•	 atom balance. There must be the same number of atoms of each element on both 
sides. In the preceding equation, the atoms present on both sides are one calcium 
atom, one carbon atom, and three oxygen atoms.
•	 charge balance. There must be the same total charge on both sides. In this ­equation, 
the total charge is zero on both sides.

Although we have introduced net ionic equations to represent precipitation reac-
tions, they have a much wider application. Indeed, we will use them for all kinds of reac-
tions in water solution. In particular all of the chemical equations written throughout 
this chapter are net ionic equations.
Stoichiometry
The approach followed in Chapter 3, with minor modifications, readily applies to the 
stoichiometry of solution reactions represented by net ionic equations.
An important consideration when solving these problems is that data are given 
about the parent compounds and not about the particular ions in the net ionic equation. 
After all, you do not have reagent bottles with labels that say 3M OH2 but rather 3M 
NaOH. Figure 4.6 (page 95) shows how the modifications fit into the flowchart for the 
stoichiometry of solution reactions.

acidic solution. Basic solutions have a slippery feeling and change the colors of indica-
tors (e.g., red to blue for litmus).
The species that give these solutions their characteristic properties are called acids 
and bases. In this chapter, we use the definitions first proposed by Svante ­Arrhenius 
more than a century ago.
An acid is a species that produces H1 ions in water solution.
A base is a species that produces OH2 ions in water solution.
We will consider more general definitions of acids and bases in Chapter 13.
Strong and Weak Acids and Bases
There are two types of acids, strong and weak, which differ in the extent of their ­ionization 
in water. Strong acids ionize completely, forming H1 ions and ­anions. A typical strong 
acid is HCl. It undergoes the following reaction on addition to water:
HCl(aq) 9: H1(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)
In a solution prepared by adding 0.1 mol of HCl to water, there is 0.1 mol of H1 ions, 
0.1 mol of Cl2 ions, and no HCl molecules. There are six common strong acids, whose 
names and formulas are listed in Table 4.1.
All acids other than those listed in Table 4.1 can be taken to be weak. A weak acid is 
only partially ionized to H1 ions in water. All of the weak acids considered in this chap-
ter are molecules containing an ionizable hydrogen atom. Their general formula can be 
represented as HB; the general ionization reaction in water is
HB(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 B2(aq)
The double arrow implies that this reaction does not go to completion. Instead, a mix-
ture is formed containing significant amounts of both products and reactants. With the 
weak acid hydrogen fluoride
HF(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 F2(aq)
a solution prepared by adding 0.1 mol of HF to a liter of water contains about 0.01 mol of 
H1 ions, 0.01 mol of F2 ions, and 0.09 mol of HF molecules.
Bases, like acids, are classified as strong or weak. A strong base in water solution 
is completely ionized to OH2 ions and cations. As you can see from Table 4.1, the 
strong bases are the hydroxides of the Group 1 and Group 2 metals. These are ­typical 
ionic solids, completely ionized both in the solid state and in water ­solution. The equa-
tions written to represent the processes by which NaOH and Ca(OH)2 dissolve in wa-
ter are

chapter Four  Reactions in Aqueous Solution
In a solution prepared by adding 0.1 mol of NaOH to water, there is 0.1 mol of Na1 ions, 
0.1 mol of OH2 ions, and no NaOH molecules.
Weak bases produce OH2 ions in a quite different manner. They react with H2O 
molecules, acquiring H1 ions and leaving OH2 ions behind. The reaction of ammonia, 
NH3, is typical:
NH3(aq) 1 H2O EF NH41(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
As with all weak bases, this reaction does not go to completion. In a solution prepared 
by adding 0.1 mol of ammonia to a liter of water, there is about 0.001 mol of NH41, 
0.001 mol of OH2, and nearly 0.099 mol of NH3.
A common class of weak bases consists of the organic molecules known as amines. 
An amine can be considered to be a derivative of ammonia in which one or more hydro-
gen atoms have been replaced by hydrocarbon groups.
In the simplest case, methylamine, a hydrogen atom is replaced by a !CH3 group 
to give the CH3NH2 molecule, which reacts with water in a manner very similar to NH3:
CH3NH2(aq) 1 H2O EF CH3NH31(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
As we have pointed out, strong acids and bases are completely ionized in ­water. As 
a result, compounds such as HCl and NaOH are strong electrolytes like NaCl. In con-
trast, molecular weak acids and weak bases are poor conductors ­because their water so-
lutions contain relatively few ions. Hydrofluoric acid and ammonia are commonly de-
scribed as weak electrolytes.
Equations for Acid-Base Reactions
When an acidic water solution is mixed with a basic water solution, an acid-base reac-
tion takes place. The nature of the reaction and hence the equation written for it depend 
on whether the acid and base involved are strong or weak.
1.  Strong acid–strong base. Consider what happens when a solution of a strong acid 
such as HNO3 is added to a solution of a strong base such as NaOH. ­Because HNO3 is a 
strong acid, it is completely converted to H1 and NO32 ions in solution. Similarly, with the 
strong base NaOH, the solution species are the Na1 and OH2 ions. When the solutions are 
mixed, the H1 and OH2 ions react with each other to form H2O molecules. This reaction, 
referred to as neutralization, is represented by the net ionic equation
H1(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: H2O
The Na1 and NO32 ions take no part in the reaction and so do not appear in the equa-
tion. Here again, we are dealing with “spectator ions.”
There is considerable evidence to indicate that the neutralization reaction ­occurs 
when any strong base reacts with any strong acid in water solution. It follows that the 
neutralization equation written above applies to any strong acid–strong base reaction.
2.  Weak acid–strong base. When a strong base such as NaOH is added to a ­solution of 
a weak acid, HB, a two-step reaction occurs. The first step is the ionization of the HB mol-
ecule to H1 and B2 ions; the second is the neutralization of the H1 ions produced in the first 
step by the OH2 ions of the NaOH solution.
(1) HB(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 B2(aq)
	
(2) H1(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: H2O
The equation for the overall reaction is obtained by adding the two equations just written 
and canceling H1 ions:
HB(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: B2(aq) 1 H2O
For the reaction between solutions of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen fluoride, the net 
ionic equation is
HF(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: F2(aq) 1 H2O
Here, as always, spectator ions such as Na1 are not included in the net ionic equation.
Methylamine, CH3NH2
A hydrocarbon group has a string of C 
and H atoms.
When an acid is weak, like HF, its for-
mula appears in the equation.
When HClO4 reacts with Ca(OH)2, the 
equation is H1(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: H2O.

99
3.  Strong acid–weak base. As an example of a reaction of a strong acid with a weak base, 
consider what happens when an aqueous solution of a strong acid like HCl is added to an aque-
ous solution of ammonia, NH3. Again, we consider the ­reaction to take place in two steps. The 
first step is the reaction of NH3 with H2O to form NH41 and OH2 ions. Then, in the second 
step, the H1 ions of the strong acid neutralize the OH2 ions formed in the first step.
(1)  NH3(aq) 1 H2O EF NH41(aq) 1 OH2(aq)

The overall equation is obtained by summing those for the individual steps. Cancel-
ing species (OH2, H2O) that appear on both sides, we obtain the net ionic equation
H1(aq) 1 NH3(aq) 9: NH41(aq)
In another case, for the reaction of a strong acid such as HNO3 with methylamine, 
CH3NH2, the net ionic equation is

Table 4.2 summarizes the equations written for the three types of acid-base reac-
tions just discussed. Figure 4.8 visually illustrates the process of determining whether a 
compound is an acid (strong or weak) or a base (strong or weak) and the nature of the 
reacting species. You should find both Table 4.2 and Figure 4.8 useful in writing the

Acid-Base Titrations
Acid-base reactions in water solution are commonly used to determine the ­concentration 
of a dissolved species or its percentage in a solid mixture. This is done by carrying out a 
titration, measuring the volume of a standard solution (a solution of known concentra-
tion) required to react with a measured amount of sample.

The experimental setup for a titration is shown in Figure 4.9 (page 100). The flask 
contains vinegar, a water solution of a weak organic acid called acetic acid. A solution of 
sodium hydroxide of known concentration is added from a buret. The net ionic equation 
for the acid-base reaction that occurs is
HC2H3O2(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: C2H3O22(aq) 1 H2O
The objective of the titration is to determine the point at which reaction is complete, 
called the equivalence point. This is reached when the number of moles of OH2 added 
is exactly equal to the number of moles of acetic acid, HC2H3O2, ­originally present. To 
determine this point, a single drop of an acid-base indicator such as phenolphthalein is 
used. It should change color (colorless to pink) at the equivalence point.
A molecular diagram for the titration of NaOH and HCl is shown in Figure 4.10. For 
simplicity, only the reacting species (H1 and OH2) are shown. The spectator ions (Na1 
and Cl2) and water molecules in solution are not.

4.3  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
4.3 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
Another common type of reaction in aqueous solution involves a transfer of electrons 
between two species. Such a reaction is called an oxidation-reduction or redox reaction. 
Many familiar reactions fit into this category, including the ­reaction of metals with acid.
In a redox reaction, one species loses (i.e., donates) electrons and is said to be oxi-
dized. The other species, which gains (or receives) electrons, is reduced. To illustrate, 
consider the redox reaction that takes place when zinc pellets are added to hydrochloric 
acid (Figure 4.11). The net ionic equation for the reaction is
Zn(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2(g)
This equation can be split into two half-equations, one of oxidation and the other of re-
duction. Zinc atoms are oxidized to Zn21 ions by losing electrons. The oxidation half-
equation is

Figure 4.11 Redox reaction of zinc 
with a strong acid. The zinc atoms are 
oxidized to Zn21 ions in solution; the H1 
ions are reduced to H2 molecules.
 

104
 
Chapter Four  Reactions in Aqueous Solution
At the same time, H1 ions are reduced to H2 molecules by gaining electrons; the reduc-
tion half-equation is
reduction:    2H1(aq) 1 2e2 9: H2(g)
From this example, it should be clear that—
• oxidation and reduction occur together in the same reaction; you can’t have one 
without the other.
• there is no net change in the number of electrons in a redox reaction. Th ose given off  
in the oxidation half-reaction are taken on by another species in the reduction half-
reaction.
In earlier sections of this chapter, we showed how to write and balance  equations for 
precipitation reactions (Section 4.1) and acid-base reactions (Section 4.2). In this section 
we will concentrate on balancing redox equations, given the identity of reactants and 
products. To do that, it is convenient to introduce a new concept, oxidation number.
For reasons that are by no means obvious, 
Sweden produced a disproportionate 
number of outstanding chemists in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 
Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848) deter-
mined with amazing accuracy the atomic 
masses of virtually all the elements known 
in his time. in his spare time, he invented 
such modern laboratory tools as the 
beaker, the ﬂ ask, the pipet, and the 
ringstand.
Svante arrhenius, like Berzelius, was 
born in Sweden and spent his entire 
 professional career there. according to 
arrhenius, the concept of strong and 
weak acids and bases came to him on 
may 13, 1883, when he was 24 years old. 
He added, “i could not sleep that night 
until i had worked through the entire 
problem.”
almost exactly one year later, arrhe-
nius submitted his ph.D. thesis at the uni-
versity of uppsala. He proposed that salts, 
strong acids, and strong bases are com-
pletely ionized in dilute water solution. 
Today, it seems quite reasonable that so-
lutions of naCl, HCl, and naoH contain, 
respectively, na1 and Cl2 ions, H1 and Cl2
ions, and na1 and oH2 ions. it did not 
seem nearly so obvious to the chemistry 
faculty at uppsala in 1884. arrhenius’s 
dissertation received the lowest passing 
grade “approved without praise.”
arrhenius sent copies of his ph.D. 
thesis to several well-known chemists in 
europe and america. most ignored his 
ideas; a few were openly hostile. a pair of 
young chemists gave positive responses: 
Jacobus van’t Hoﬀ  (1852–1911) (age 32) 
at amsterdam (Holland) and Wilhelm 
ostwald (1853–1932) (also 32) at riga 
(latvia). For some years, these three 
young men were referred to, somewhat 
disparagingly, as “ionists” or “ionians.” as 
time passed, the situation changed. The 
fi rst nobel prize in chemistry was awarded 
to van’t Hoﬀ  in 1901. Two years later, in 
1903, arrhenius became a nobel laureate; 
ostwald followed in 1909.
among other contributions of arrhe-
nius, the most important were probably in 
chemical kinetics (Chapter 11). in 1889 he 
derived the relation for the temperature 
 dependence of reaction rate. in quite a 
diﬀ erent area, in 1896 arrhenius pub-
lished an article, “on the inﬂ uence of 
Carbon Dioxide in the air on the Tempera-
ture of the Ground.” He presented the 
basic idea of the greenhouse eﬀ ect, dis-
cussed in Chapter 16.
in his later years, arrhenius turned his 
attention to popularizing chemistry. He 
wrote several diﬀ erent textbooks that 
were well received. in 1925, under pres-
sure from his publisher to submit a manu-
script, arrhenius started getting up at 4 
A.M. to write. as might be expected, rising 
at such an early hour had an adverse eﬀ ect 
on his health. arrhenius suﬀ ered a physical 
breakdown in 1925, from which he never 
really recovered, dying two years later.

Oxidation Number
Th e concept of oxidation number is used to simplify the electron bookkeeping in redox 
reactions. For a monatomic ion (e.g., Na1, S22), the oxidation number is, quite simply, 
the charge of the ion (11, 22). In a molecule or polyatomic ion, the oxidation number 
of an element is a “pseudo-charge” obtained in a rather  arbitrary way, assigning bonding 
electrons to the atom with the greater attraction for electrons.
In practice, oxidation numbers in all kinds of species are assigned according to a set 
of arbitrary rules:
 1. Th e oxidation number of an element in an elementary substance is .
  Example: The oxidation number for chlorine in Cl2 and for phosphorus in P4 is 0.
 2. The oxidation number of an element in a monoatomic ion is equal to the charge of that 
ion.
  Example: The oxidation number for chlorine in Cl2 is 21; for sodium in Na1 it is 11.
 3. Certain elements (We will call them“leading elements.”) have the same oxidation 
number in all their compounds.
  Group 1 elements always have an oxidation number of 11.
    Group 2 elements always have an oxidation number of 12.
    Fluorine (F) always has an oxidation number of 21.
 4. Hydrogen in a compound has an oxidation number of 11, unless it is combined with 
a metal, in which case it is 21.
  Example: The oxidation number for hydrogen in HCl is 11; for hydrogen in NaH it is 
21.
 5. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral species is 0 and in a polyatomic ion is 
equal to the charge of the ion.
  Examples:
  a.  To determine the oxidation number of P in PH3, use the fact that H has an oxidation 
number of 11 (since it is combined with P, a nonmetal) and solve algebraically us-
ing the above rule. Note that there are 3 H atoms, each with an oxidation number of 
11. We will call the oxidation number of P, x.
     3(11) 1 x 5 0; x 5 23. The oxidation number for P in PH3 is 23.
  b.  To determine the oxidation number of N in NH41, use the fact that H has an oxida-
tion number of 11 (since it is combined with N, a nonmetal) and solve algebraically 
using the above rule. Note that there are 4 H atoms, each with an oxidation number 
of 11. We will call the oxidation number of N, y.
     4(11) 1 y 5 21; y 5 23. The oxidation number for N in NH41 is 23.
 6. Oxygen in a compound has an oxidation number of 22, unless it is combined with a 
Group 1 metal (always 11) or Group 2 metal (always 12). Solve algebraically for the 
oxidation number of oxygen.
  Examples:
  a. The oxidation number (oxid. no.) for oxygen in Na2O is
     2(11) 1 oxid. no. O 5 0; oxid. no. O 5 22
  b. The oxidation number (oxid. no.) for oxygen in Na2O2 is
     2(11) 1 2(oxid. no. O) 5 0; oxid. no. O 5 21
  c. The oxidation number (oxid. no.) for oxygen in NaO2 is
     11 1 2(oxid. no. O) 5 0; oxid. no. O 5 21/2
The application of these rules is illustrated in Example 4.6.
oxidation numbers are calculated, not 
determined experimentally.

chapter Four  Reactions in Aqueous Solution
The concept of oxidation number leads directly to a working definition of the terms 
oxidation and reduction. Oxidation is defined as an increase in oxidation number and 
reduction as a decrease in oxidation number. Consider once again the reaction of zinc 
with a strong acid:
Zn(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2(g)        Zn is oxidized (oxid. no.: 0 9: 12)
	
H1 is reduced (oxid. no.: 11 9: 0)
These definitions are of course compatible with the interpretation of oxidation and 
reduction in terms of loss and gain of electrons. An element that loses ­electrons must in-
crease in oxidation number. The gain of electrons always results in a decrease in oxidation 
number.
An easy way to recognize a redox equation is to note changes in oxidation number 
of two different elements. The net ionic equation
2Al(s) 1 3Cu21(aq) 9: 2Al31(aq) 1 3Cu(s)
must represent a redox reaction because aluminum increases in oxidation number, from 
0 to 13, and copper decreases from 12 to 0. In contrast, the reaction
CO322(aq) 1 2H1(aq) 9: CO2(g) 1 H2O
is not of the redox type because each element has the same oxidation number in both 
reactants and products: for O it is 22, for H it is 11, and for C it is 14.
The two species that exchange electrons in a redox reaction are given special names. 
The ion or molecule that accepts electrons is called the oxidizing agent; by accepting elec-
trons it brings about the oxidation of another species. Conversely, the species that donates 
electrons is called the reducing agent; when reaction occurs it reduces the other species.
To illustrate these concepts consider the reaction
Zn(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2(g)
The H1 ion is the oxidizing agent; it brings about the oxidation of zinc. By the same to-
ken, zinc acts as a reducing agent; it furnishes the electrons required to ­reduce H1 ions.
Metallic elements taking part in redox reactions, such as zinc in the reaction above, 
commonly act as reducing agents; they are oxidized to cations such as Zn21. Other re-
ducing agents include hydrogen gas, which can be oxidized to H1 ions:
H2(g) 9: 2H1(aq) 1 2e2

END POINT
Always look for the “leading elements” (Group 1 and Group 2 metals and F) in a compound when you start. These elements 
will lead you to the oxidation numbers of the other elements in the compound. If these leading elements are not present, 
then look for H and O (11 and 22, respectively, when not combined with Group 1 or 2 metals.)

reducing agent is oxidized.

Balancing Half-Equations (Oxidation or Reduction)
Before you can balance an overall redox equation, you have to be able to balance two 
half-equations, one for oxidation (electron loss) and one for reduction (electron gain). 
Sometimes that’s easy. Given the oxidation half-equation
Fe21(aq) 9: Fe31(aq)        (oxid. no. Fe: 12 9: 13)
it is clear that mass and charge balance can be achieved by adding an electron to the 
right:
Fe21(aq) 9: Fe31(aq) 1 e2 
In another case, this time a reduction half-equation,
Cl2(g) 9: Cl2(aq)        (oxid. no. Cl: 0 9: 21)
mass balance is obtained by writing a coefficient of 2 for Cl2; charge is then ­balanced by 
adding two electrons to the left. The balanced half-equation is
Cl2(g) 1 2e2 9: 2Cl2(aq)
	
4.3  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

108
	
chapter Four  Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Sometimes, though, it is by no means obvious how a given half-equation is to be 
balanced. This commonly happens when elements other than those being ­oxidized or 
reduced take part in the reaction. Most often, these elements are oxygen (oxid. no. 5 22) 
and hydrogen (oxid. no. 5 11). Consider, for example, the ­ half-equation for the reduc-
tion of the permanganate ion,
MnO42(aq) 9: Mn21(aq)        (oxid. no. Mn: 17 9: 12)
or the oxidation of chromium(III) hydroxide,
Cr(OH)3(s) 9: CrO422(aq)        (oxid. no. Cr: 13 9: 16)
To balance half-equations such as these, proceed as follows:
(a)	 Assign oxidation numbers to each element.
(b)	 Balance the atoms of each element being oxidized or reduced.
(c)	 Multiply the oxidation number by the number of atoms that have that oxidation num-
ber. This gives you the “total” oxidation number.
	 	 The number of atoms is indicated either by the coefficient that you used to balance the 
atoms or by the subscript of the atom.
(d)	 Balance oxidation number by adding electrons.
	 	 Electrons are added to the left for a reduction half-equation and to the right for an oxi-
dation half-equation.
	 	 The number of electrons added should equal the change in “total” number from part (c).
(e)	 Balance charge by adding H1 ions in acidic solution and OH2 ions in basic solution.
(f)	 Balance hydrogen by adding H2O molecules.
(g)	 Check to make sure that oxygen is balanced.
	 	 If it is, the half-equation is almost certainly balanced correctly with respect to mass 
and charge. 
Example 4.8 shows how these rules are applied to balance half-equations.

Balancing Redox Equations
The process used to balance an overall redox equation is relatively straightforward, pro-
vided you know how to balance half-equations. Follow a systematic, four-step 
procedure:
(1)	 Split the equation into two half-equations, one for reduction, the other for 
­oxidation.
(2)	 Balance one of the half-equations with respect to both atoms and charge as described 
above (steps a through e).
(3)	 Balance the other half-equation.
(4)	 Combine the two half-equations in such a way as to eliminate electrons.
Suppose, for example, the two balanced half-equations are
A(s) 9: A21(aq) 1 2e2 
B31(aq) 1 3e2 9: B(s) 
Multiplying the first half-equation by 3, the second by 2, and adding gives
3A(s) 1 2B31(aq) 9: 3A21(aq) 1 2B(s)
The electrons, six on both sides, cancel.
SOLUTION
 (f) Balance H	
reactants: 0 H  products: 4 H
 	
To balance, add 2H2O on the left.
 	
NO32(aq) 1 3e2 1 2H2O : NO(g) 1 4 OH2(aq)
 	
reactants: 4 H  products: 4 H

reactants: 3 1 2 = 5  products: 4 1 1 = 5
      The half-equation is balanced:	
NO32(aq) 1 3e2 : NO(g) 1 4 OH2(aq)
(2) (a) Oxidation numbers	
Cl: 0 : 15; O: 22 : 22; Cl is oxidized.

by 10. Add 10 electrons to the product side.
 	
Cl2(g) : 2ClO32(aq) 1 10e2

Chapter Four  Reactions in Aqueous Solution
Reversible Color Changes
Gregory Sotzing, University of Connecticut
many compounds can change their color reversibly when subjected 
to some form of external stimulus. The phenomenon is called 
chromism and the materials are  characterized as chromogenic.
photochromics (light stimulated) and thermo chromics (tempera-
ture stimulated) are two 
of the most common 
chromogenic materials 
with practical applica-
tions. 
optical 
lenses 
have photochromic fi lm 
so they darken when 
 exposed 
to 
sunlight. 
Thermochromics 
are 
used in the strips sold 
with alkaline batteries to 
test whether the battery 
is still usable.
CHemiSTry beYoNd the ClaSSrooM
electrochromics are another form of chromogenic materials 
that undergo a color change when electrons are added or removed. 
Today, electrochromics are used in  autodimming rearview mirrors 
to prevent headlights from blinding the driver,  autoshading 
windows and skylights for privacy and energy conservation, and 
color changing transparent roofs for automobiles such as the 
Ferrari (Figure a) and other high-end vehicles.
polymers, large molecules made up of smaller molecules in a 
repeating pattern, are used for many electrochromic materials. 
Conjugating polymers, which have  alternating single and double 
bonds, are particularly suitable. Figure B shows the  electrochemical 
 oxidation of the conjugated polymer, polythiophene. oxidation (in 
which electrons are removed) produces a semiconductive polymer. 
The neutral  (unoxidized) polythiophene is red in color, whereas the 
semiconductive polythiophene (oxidized) is blue. in their neutral 
state, these polymers have a wavelength of maximum absorption 
in the visible region of the spectrum, which gives the polymer a

specifi c color. When electrons are  removed, “holes” are created, 
which act as charge carriers. These changes result in transition to a 
diﬀ erent color.
Diﬀ erent color transitions are obtained by simply changing the 
molecular structure of the polythiophene and then oxidizing or re-
ducing it. Figure C (page 112) shows the diﬀ erent colors obtained 
by taking the neutral form (0), oxidizing it (1), reducing it (2), or 
 reducing twice (22).
The rigid chemical structure of a conjugated polymer helps in 
the movement of electrons. That stiﬀ  structure, however, has 
limited its use. They are like uncooked spaghetti and do not easily 
entangle themselves. polymer chain entanglements are necessary 
to achieve high viscosities, which are required to create fi bers out 
of these polymers.
recent research in my group has devised a method to create 
long (about 3 feet) fi bers. The fi bers fi rst appear white. When they 
are dipped into an oxidizing agent (to remove electrons), the fi bers 
become conductive and turn a deep blue. When an  electrical 
charge is applied (to add electrons), the color changes to bright 
orange.
There can be many uses for these fi bers. Weaving them into 
fabric, for example, could create color-changing camouﬂ age uni-
forms for soldiers. The colors could change to desert browns, or, 
when stimulated by a battery-produced electrical charge, the uni-
forms could have colors that resemble forest and jungle greens. 
Someday, you may have t-shirts that can change colors with the ﬂ ip 
of a switch.
For more information on clothing incorporating these fi bers, see 
NewScientist 07 april 2006 issue no. 2546.

y far the most familiar gas to all of us is the air we breathe. The Greeks ­considered air 
to be one of the four fundamental elements of nature, along with earth, water, and 
fire. Late in the eighteenth century, Cavendish, Priestley, and Lavoisier studied the 
composition of air, which is primarily a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with smaller amounts 
of argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. Today it appears that the concentrations of some 
of the minor components of the atmosphere may be changing, with adverse effects on the 
environment. The depletion of the ozone layer and increases in the amounts of “green-
house” gases are topics for the evening news, television dramas, and movies. 
All gases resemble one another closely in their physical behavior. Their volumes re-
spond in almost exactly the same way to changes in pressure, temperature, or amount of 
gas. In fact, it is possible to write a simple equation relating these four variables that is valid 
for all gases. This equation, known as the ideal gas law, is the central theme of this chapter; 
it is introduced in Section 5.2. The law is ­applied to
• pure gases in Section 5.3.
• gases in chemical reactions in Section 5.4.
• gas mixtures in Section 5.5.

Gases
Religious faith is a most filling vapor. 
It swirls occluded in us under tight 
Compression to uplift us out of weight— 
As in those buoyant bird bones thin as 
paper, 
To give them still more buoyancy in 
flight. 
Some gas like helium must be innate.

The density of a gas decreases when the 
temperature of the gas is increased. The 
heated air in the balloon is lighter than 
the air around the balloon. This density 
difference causes the balloon to rise (after 
it is untethered).

5.1  MEASUREMENTS ON GASES
Section 5.6 considers the kinetic theory of gases, the molecular model on which the ideal 
gas law is based. Finally, in Section 5.7 we describe the extent to which real gases deviate 
from the law.
5.1 Measurements on Gases
To completely describe the state of a gaseous substance, its volume, amount, ­temperature, 
and pressure are specified. The first three of these quantities were ­discussed in earlier 
chapters and will be reviewed briefly in this section. Pressure, a somewhat more abstract 
quantity, will be examined in more detail.
Volume, Amount, and Temperature
A gas expands uniformly to fill any container in which it is placed. This means that the 
volume of a gas is the volume of its container. Volumes of gases can be ­expressed in liters, 
cubic centimeters, or cubic meters:
1 L 5 103 cm3 5 1023 m3
Most commonly, the amount of matter in a gaseous sample is expressed in terms of 
the number of moles (n). In some cases, the mass in grams is given instead. These two 
quantities are related through the molar mass, MM:
n 5 mass
MM
The temperature of a gas is ordinarily measured using a thermometer marked in 
degrees Celsius. However, as we will see in Section 5.2, in any calculation involv­ing the 
physical behavior of gases, temperatures must be expressed on the Kelvin scale. To con-
vert between 8C and K, use the relation introduced in Chapter 1:
TK 5 t8C 1 273.15
Typically, in gas law calculations, temperatures are expressed only to the nearest degree. 
In that case, the Kelvin temperature can be found by simply adding 273 to the Celsius 
temperature.
Pressure
Pressure is defined as force per unit area. You are probably familiar with the ­English unit 
“pounds per square inch,” often abbreviated psi. When we say that a gas exerts a pressure 
of 15 psi, we mean that the pressure on the walls of the gas container is 15 pounds (of 
force) per square inch of wall area.
A device commonly used to measure atmospheric pressure is the mercury barome-
ter (Figure 5.1), first constructed by Evangelista Torricelli in the seventeenth century. 
This consists of a closed gas tube filled with mercury inverted over a pool of mercury. 
The pressure exerted by the mercury column exactly equals that of the atmosphere. 
Hence the height of the column is a measure of the atmospheric ­pressure. At or near sea 
level, it typically varies from 740 to 760 mm, depending on weather conditions.
Most barometers contain mercury rather than some other liquid. Its high ­density 
allows the barometer to be a convenient size. A water barometer needs to be 10,340 mm 
(34 ft) high to register atmospheric pressure!
The pressure of a confined gas can be measured by a manometer of the type 
shown in Figure 5.2 (page 122). Here again the fluid used is mercury. If the level in 
the inner tube (A) is lower than that in the outer tube (B), the pressure of the gas is 
greater than that of the atmosphere. If the reverse is true, the gas pressure is less than 
­atmospheric pressure.
Because of the way in which gas pressure is measured, it is often expressed in milli­
meters of mercury (mm Hg). Thus we might say that the atmospheric pressure on a 
certain day is 772 mm Hg. This means that the pressure of the air is equal to that exerted 
by a column of mercury 772 mm (30.4 in) high.
Figure 5.1 A mercury barometer. 
This is the type of barometer first con-
structed by Torricelli. The pressure of 
the ­atmosphere pushes the mercury in 
the dish to rise into the glass tube. The 
height of the column of mercury is a 
measure of the atmospheric pressure.

chapter FIVE  Gases
The pressure exerted by a column of mercury depends on its density, which varies 
slightly with temperature. To get around this ambiguity, the torr was defined to be the 
pressure exerted by 1 mm of mercury at certain specified conditions, ­notably 08C. Over 
time, the unit torr has become a synonym for millimeter of mercury. Throughout this 
text, we will use millimeter of mercury rather than torr because the former has a clearer 
physical meaning.
Another unit commonly used to express gas pressure is the standard ­atmosphere, or 
simply atmosphere (atm). This is the pressure exerted by a ­column of mercury 760 mm 
high with the mercury at 08C. If we say that a gas has a pressure of 0.98 atm, we mean 
that the pressure is 98% of that exerted by a ­mercury column 760 mm high.
In the International System (Appendix 1), the standard unit of pressure is the pascal 
(Pa). A pascal is a very small unit; it is approximately the pressure exerted by a film of 
water 0.1 mm high on the surface beneath it. A related unit is the bar (105 Pa). A bar is 
nearly, but not quite, equal to an atmosphere:
1.013 bar 5 1 atm 5 760 mm Hg 5 14.7 psi 5 101.3 k Pa
1 bar 5 105 Pa

5.2  THE IDEAL GAS LAW
5.2 The Ideal Gas Law
All gases closely resemble each other in the dependence of volume on amount, tempera-
ture, and pressure.
1.  Volume is directly proportional to amount. Figure 5.3a shows a typical plot of vol-
ume (V) versus number of moles (n) for a gas. Notice that the graph is a straight line passing 
through the origin. The general equation for such a plot is
V 5 k1n        (constant T, P)
where k1 is a constant (the slope of the line in Figure 5.3a). That means k1 is independent 
of individual values of V, n, and the nature of the gas. This is the equation of a direct 
proportionality.
STRATEGY

2. Use the temperature conversion formula.

well above 0 K.

chapter FIVE  Gases
2.  Volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature. The dependence of volume 
(V) on the Kelvin temperature (T) is shown in Figure 5.3b. The graph is a straight line 
through the origin. The equation of the line is
V 5 k2T        (constant n, P)
where k2 is again the slope of the line in Figure 5.3b. This relationship was first suggested 
in a different form, by two French scientists, Jacques Charles (1746–1823) and Joseph 
Gay-Lussac (1778–1850), both of whom were balloonists. Hence it is often referred to as 
the law of Charles and Gay-Lussac or, simply, as Charles’s law.
3.  Volume is inversely proportional to pressure. Figure 5.4 shows a typical plot of vol-
ume (V) versus pressure (P). Notice that V decreases as P increases. The graph is a hyperbola. 
The general relation between the two variables is
V 5k3
P         (constant n, T )
The quantity k3, like k1 and k2, is a constant. This is the equation of an inverse proportion-
ality. The fact that volume is inversely proportional to pressure was first established in 
1660 by Robert Boyle (1627–1691), an Irish experimental scientist. The equation above is 
one form of Boyle’s law.
The three equations relating the volume, pressure, temperature, and amount of a gas can 
be combined into a single equation. Because V is directly proportional to both n and T,
V 5 k1n        V 5 k2T
and inversely proportional to P,
V 5 k3
P
it follows that
V 5 constant 3 n 3 T
P
We can evaluate the constant (k1k2k3) in this equation by taking advantage of Avoga-
dro’s law, which states that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pres-
sure contain the same number of moles. For this law to hold, the constant must be the 
same for all gases. Ordinarily it is represented by the symbol R. Both sides of the equa-
tion are multiplied by P to give the ideal gas law

5.3  GAS LAW CALCULATIONS
where P is the pressure, V the volume, n the number of moles, and T the Kelvin ­temperature. 
Experimentally, it is found that the ideal gas law predicts remarkably well the experimental 
behavior of real gases (e.g., H2, N2, O2 . . .) at ordinary ­temperatures and pressures.
The value of the gas constant R can be calculated from experimental values of P, V, 
n, and T. Consider, for example, the situation that applies at 08C and 1 atm. These condi-
tions are often referred to as standard temperature and pressure (STP) for a gas. At STP, 
one mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 L. Solving the ideal gas law for R,
R 5 PV
nT
Substituting P 5 1.00 atm, V 5 22.4 L, n 5 1.00 mol, and T 5 0 1 273 5 273 K,
R 5 1.00 atm 3 22.4 L
1.00 mol 3 273 K 5 0.0821 L · atm/(mol · K)
Notice that R has the units of atmospheres, liters, moles, and K. These units must be 
used for pressure, volume, amount, and temperature in any problem in which this value 
of R is used.
Throughout most of this chapter, we will use 0.0821 L · atm/(mol · K) as the value of 
R. For certain purposes, however, R must be expressed in different units (Table 5.1).
5.3 Gas Law Calculations
The ideal gas law can be used to solve a variety of problems. We will show how you can 
use it to find
•	 the final state of a gas, knowing its initial state and the changes in P, V, n, or T that 
occur.
•	 one of the four variables, P, V, n, or T, given the values of the other three.
•	 the molar mass or density of a gas.
Final and Initial State Problems
A gas commonly undergoes a change from an initial to a final state. Typically, you are asked 
to determine the effect on V, P, n, or T of a change in one or more of these variables. For 
example, starting with a sample of gas at 258C and 1.00 atm, you might be asked to calculate 
the pressure developed when the sample is heated to 958C at constant volume.
The ideal gas law is readily applied to problems of this type. A relationship ­between 
the variables involved is derived from this law. In this case, pressure and temperature 
change, while n and V remain constant.

Note that the volume of the tank is never used in the calculations. It is important not only to read the problem carefully but 
also to visualize the description of the gas container. If the gas were in a balloon, instead of in a steel tank, the calculations 
would be different.

The ideal gas law offers a simple approach to the experimental determination of the mo-

(Example 5.4). All you need to know is the mass of a sample confined to a container of 
fixed volume at a particular temperature and pressure.
Example 5.4 Graded
Acetone is widely used as a nail polish remover. A sample of liquid acetone is placed in a 3.00-L flask and vaporized by

results.
From this equation we see that the density of a gas is dependent on
•	 pressure. Compressing a gas increases its density.
•	 temperature. Hot air rises because a gas becomes less dense when its temperature is 
increased. Hot air balloons are filled with air at a temperature higher than that of the 
atmosphere, making the air inside less dense than that outside. First used in France in 
the eighteenth century, they are now seen in balloon races and other sporting events. 
Heat is supplied on demand by a propane burner.
•	 molar mass. Hydrogen (MM 5 2.016 g/mol) has the lowest molar mass and the lowest 
density (at a given P and T) of all gases. Hence it has the greatest lifting power in 
“lighter-than-air” balloons. However, hydrogen has not been used in balloons carry-
ing passengers since 1937, when the Hindenburg, a hydrogen-filled airship, exploded 
and burned. Helium (MM 5 4.003 g/mol) is slightly less ­effective than hydrogen but 
a lot safer to work with because it is nonflammable. It is used in a variety of balloons, 
ranging from the small ones used at parties to ­meteorological balloons with volumes 
of a billion liters.
Very light gases, notably hydrogen and helium, tend to escape from the earth’s at-
mosphere. The hydrogen you generate in the laboratory today is well on its way into 
outer space tomorrow. A similar situation holds with helium, which is found in very 
limited quantities mixed with natural gas in wells below the earth’s surface. If helium is 
allowed to escape, it is gone forever, and our supply of this very useful gaseous element 
is depleted.

5.4 Stoichiometry of Gaseous Reactions
As pointed out in Chapter 3, a balanced equation can be used to relate moles or grams of 
substances taking part in a reaction. Where gases are involved, these relations can be 
extended to include volumes. To do this, we use the ideal gas law and modify Figures 3.8 
and 4.6 as shown in Figure 5.5. Note that the ideal gas law equation can be used only for 
gaseous reactants and products. 
The yellow balloon
contains helium (MM
= 4.003 g/mole) and
has a lower density
than air at the same
temperature and
pressure.
Gas density decreases with
rising temperature, allowing
the balloons to rise, as shown
in this time exposure taken at
the Great Reno Balloon Race.
The other balloons
contain air, which is
more dense than
helium because it
has a higher molar
mass (29.0 g/L).

chApter FIVe  Gases
Perhaps the fi rst stoichiometric relationship to be discovered was the law of combin-
ing volumes, proposed by Gay-Lussac in 1808: Th e volume ratio of any two gases in a 
reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the same as the reacting mole ratio.
To illustrate the law, consider the reaction
2H2O(l) 9: 2H2(g) 1 O2(g)
As you can see from Figure 5.6, the volume of hydrogen produced is twice that of the 
other gaseous product, oxygen.
Th e law of combining volumes, like so many relationships involving gases, is readily 
explained by the ideal gas law. At constant temperature and pressure, volume is directly 
proportional to number of moles (V 5 k1n). It follows that for gaseous species involved 
in reactions, the volume ratio must be the same as the mole ratio given by the coeff i-
cients of the balanced equation.
STRATeGy
1. The presence of enough given data to calculate the number of moles of each reactant tells you that part (c) is a 
limiting reactant problem. 
2. Follow the flow chart in Figure 5.5 to determine the number of moles of CO2 obtained if HCl is limiting. You 
can obtain the moles of CO2 if NaHCO3 is limiting from part (a). 
3. Compare the moles of CO2 obtained using H1 as the limiting reactant to the moles of CO2 obtained using 
NaHCO3 as the limiting reactant. Choose the smaller number of moles of CO2. 
4. Use the ideal gas law to convert mol CO2 to the volume of CO2.

5.4  STOICHIOMETRY OF GASEOUS REACTIONS
Avogadro’s law (page 124) was proposed in 
1811 by an Italian physicist at the university 
of Turin with the improbable name of 
Lorenzo Romano Amadeo Carlo Avogadro 
di Quarequa e di Cerreto (1776 –1856).
Avogadro suggested this relationship to 
explain the law of combining volumes. 
Today it seems obvious. For example, in the 
reaction
2H2o(l) 9: 2H2(g) 1 o2(g)
the volume of hydrogen, like the number of 
moles, is twice that of oxygen. Hence, equal 
volumes of these gases must contain the 
same number of moles or molecules. This 
was by no means obvious to Avogadro’s 
contemporaries. berzelius, among  others, 
dismissed Avogadro’s ideas because he did 
not believe diatomic molecules composed 
of identical atoms (H2, o2) could exist. 
Dalton went a step further; he  refused to 
accept the law of combining volumes 
because he thought it implied  splitting 
atoms.
As a result of arguments like these, Avo-
gadro’s ideas lay dormant for nearly half a 
century. They were revived by another 
Italian scientist, Stanislao Cannizzaro, pro-
fessor of chemistry at the university of 
Genoa. At a conference held in Karlsruhe in 
1860, he persuaded the chemistry commu-
nity of the validity of Avogadro’s law and 
showed how it could be used to determine 
molar and atomic masses.
The quantity now called “Avogadro’s 
number” (6.02 3 1023/mol) was fi rst esti-
mated in 1865, nine years after Avogadro 
died. not until well into the twentieth 
century did it acquire its present name. It 
seems appropriate to honor Avogadro in 
this way for the contributions he made to 
chemical theory.

5.5  GAS MIXTURES: PARTIAL PRESSURES AND MOLE FRACTIONS
5.5 Gas Mixtures: Partial Pressures 
and Mole Fractions
Because the ideal gas law applies to all gases, you might expect it to apply to gas mixtures. 
Indeed it does. For a mixture of two gases A and B, the total pressure is given by the 
expression
Ptot 5 ntot RT
V  5 (nA 1 nB) RT
V
Separating the two terms on the right,
Ptot 5 nA RT
V  1 nB RT
V
The terms nART/V and nBRT/V are, according to the ideal gas law, the pressures that 
gases A and B would exert if they were alone. These quantities are referred to as partial 
pressures, PA and PB.
PA 5 partial pressure A 5 nART/V
PB 5 partial pressure B 5 nBRT/V
Substituting PA and PB for nART/V and nBRT/V in the equation for Ptot,
	
Ptot 5 PA 1 PB	
(5.3)
The relation just derived was first proposed by John Dalton in 1801; it is often re-
ferred to as Dalton’s law of partial pressures:
The total pressure of a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components of 
the mixture.
To illustrate Dalton’s law, consider a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and helium in 
which
PH2 5 2.46 atm        PHe 5 3.69 atm
It follows from Dalton’s law that
Ptot 5 2.46 atm 1 3.69 atm 5 6.15 atm
Wet Gases; Partial Pressure of Water
When a gas such as hydrogen is collected by bubbling through water (Figure 5.7), it picks 
up water vapor; molecules of H2O escape from the liquid and enter the gas phase. Dal-
ton’s law can be applied to the resulting gas mixture:
Ptot 5 PH2O 1 PH2
Partial pressure is the pressure 
a gas would exert if it occupied 
the entire­ volume by itself.
Figure 5.7 Collecting a gas by water 
­displacement. (a) Hydrogen gas is 
­being generated in the flask by an  
acidic solution dripping onto a metal. 
(b) When a gas is collected by displac-
ing water, it becomes saturated with 
water vapor. The partial pressure of 
H2O(g) in the collecting flask is equal 
to the vapor pressure of liquid water at 
the temperature of the system.

chapter FIVE  Gases
In this case, Ptot is the measured pressure. The partial pressure of water vapor, PH2O , is 
equal to the vapor pressure of liquid water. It has a fixed value at a given temperature 
(see Appendix 1). The partial pressure of hydrogen, PH2, can be calculated by subtraction. 
The number of moles of hydrogen in the wet gas, nH2, can then be determined using the 
ideal gas law.
Vapor pressure, like density and solubility, is an intensive physical property that is 
characteristic of a particular substance. The vapor pressure of water at 258C is 23.76 mm 
Hg, independent of volume or the presence of another gas. Like density and solubility, 
vapor pressure varies with temperature; for water it is 55.3 mm Hg at 408C, 233.7 mm Hg 
at 708C, and 760.0 mm Hg at 1008C. We will have more to say in Chapter 9 about the 
temperature dependence of vapor pressure.

5.6 Kinetic Theory of Gases
The fact that the ideal gas law applies to all gases indicates that the gaseous state is a rela-
tively simple one from a molecular standpoint. Gases must have certain ­common prop-
erties that cause them to follow the same natural law. Between about 1850 and 1880, 
James Maxwell (1831–1879), Rudolf Clausius (1822–1888), Ludwig Boltzmann 
(1844 –1906), and others developed the kinetic theory of gases. They based it on the idea 
that all gases ­behave similarly as far as particle ­motion is concerned.
Molecular Model
By the use of the kinetic theory, it is possible to derive or explain the experimental be-
havior of gases. To do this we start with a simple molecular model, which assumes that
•	 gases are mostly empty space. The total volume of the molecules is negligibly small 
compared with that of the container to which they are confined.

•	 gas molecules are in constant, chaotic motion. They collide frequently with one an-
other and with the container walls. As a result, their velocities are constantly changing.
•	 collisions are elastic. There are no attractive forces that would tend to make mole-
cules “stick” to one another or to the container walls.
•	 gas pressure is caused by collisions of molecules with the walls of the container (Figure 
5.8). As a result, pressure increases with the energy and frequency of these collisions.
Expression for Pressure, P
Applying the laws of physics to this simple model, it can be shown that the pressure (P) 
exerted by a gas in a container of volume V is
P 5 N1mass2u2

where N is the number of molecules, and u is the average speed.* We will not attempt to 
derive this equation. However, it makes sense, at least qualitatively. In particular
•	 the ratio N/V expresses the concentration of gas molecules in the container. The more 
molecules there are in a given volume, the greater the collision frequency and so the 
greater the pressure.
•	 the product (mass)(u2) is a measure of the energy of collision. (When a Cadillac trav-
eling at 100 mph collides with a brick wall, the energy transferred is much greater 
than would be obtained with a bicycle at 5 mph.) Hence, as this equation predicts, 
pressure is directly related to (mass)(u2).

But the ideal gas law tells us that PV 5 nRT, so
Et 5 3nRT

This equation can be simplified by noting that the number of molecules, N, in a gas 
sample is equal to the number of moles, n, multiplied by Avogadro’s number, NA, that is, 
N 5 n 3 NA. Making this substitution in the above equation and ­simplifying, we obtain 
the final expression for the average translational kinetic energy of a gas molecule:

This equation contains three constants (3/2, R, NA) and only one variable, the tem-
perature T. It follows that
•	 at a given temperature, molecules of different gases (e.g., H2, O2, . . .) must all have 
the same average kinetic energy of translational motion.
•	 the average translational kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly ­proportional to 
the Kelvin temperature, T.

5.6  KINETIC THEORY OF GASES
Effusion of Gases; Graham’s Law
All of us are familiar with the process of gaseous diffusion, in which gas molecules move 
through space from a region of high concentration to one of low ­concentration. If your 
instructor momentarily opens a cylinder of chlorine gas at the lecture table, you will 
soon recognize the sharp odor of chlorine, particularly if you have a front-row seat in the 
classroom. On a more pleasant note, the odor associated with a freshly baked apple pie 
also reaches you via gaseous diffusion.
Diffusion is a relatively slow process; a sample of gas introduced at one ­location may 
take an hour or more to distribute itself uniformly throughout a room. At first glance 
this seems surprising, since as we saw in Example 5.10 gas molecules are moving very 
rapidly. However, molecules are constantly colliding with one ­another; at 258C and 
1 atm, an N2 molecule undergoes more than a ­billion collisions per second with its 
neighbors. This slows down the net movement of gas molecules in any given direction.
As we have implied, diffusion is a rather complex process so far as molecular motion 
is concerned. Effusion, the flow of gas molecules at low pressures through tiny pores or 
pinholes, is easier to analyze using kinetic theory.
The relative rates of effusion of different gases depend on two factors: the pressures 
of the gases and the relative speeds of their particles. If two different gases A and B are 
compared at the same pressure, only their speeds are of ­concern, and

riety of chemical and physical problems, among them the separation of the components 
of air. Graham’s law can be stated as
At a given temperature and pressure, the rate of effusion of a gas, in moles per unit time, is 
inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.
Graham’s law tells us qualitatively that light molecules effuse more rapidly than 
heavier ones (Figure 5.9, page 142). In quantitative form, it allows us to determine molar 
masses of gases (Example 5.11).
Example 5.11    
In an effusion experiment, argon gas is allowed to expand through a tiny opening into an evacuated flask of volume 
120 mL for 32.0 s, at which point the pressure in the flask is found to be 12.5 mm Hg. This experiment is repeated with 
a gas X of unknown molar mass at the same T and P. It is found that the pressure in the flask builds up to 12.5 mm Hg 
after 48.0 s. Calculate the molar mass of X.

5.6  KINETIC THEORY OF GASES
A practical application of Graham’s law arose during World War II, when scientists 
were studying the fission of uranium atoms as a source of energy. It became necessary to 
separate 235
92U, which is fissionable, from the more abundant isotope of uranium, 238
92U, 
which is not fissionable. Because the two isotopes have almost identical chemical prop-
erties, chemical separation was not feasible. Instead, an ­effusion process was worked out 
using uranium hexafluoride, UF6. This compound is a gas at room temperature and low 
pressures. Preliminary experiments indicated that 235
92UF6 could indeed be separated 
from 238
92UF6 by effusion. The ­separation factor is very small, because the rates of effusion 
of these two species are nearly equal:
rate of effusion of 92
235UF6
rate of effusion of 92
238UF6
5 a352.0
349.0b
1/2
 5 1.004
so a great many repetitive separations are necessary. An enormous plant was built for 
this purpose in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In this process, UF6 effuses many ­thousands of 
times through porous barriers. The lighter fractions move on to the next stage, while 
heavier fractions are recycled through earlier stages. Eventually, a nearly complete sepa-
ration of the two isotopes is achieved.
Distribution of Molecular Speeds
As shown in Example 5.10, the average speed of an N2 molecule at 258C is 515 m/s; that of 
H2 is even higher, 1920 m/s. However, not all molecules in these gases have these speeds. 
The motion of particles in a gas is utterly chaotic. In the course of a second, a particle un-
dergoes millions of collisions with other particles. As a ­result, the speed and direction of 
motion of a particle are constantly changing. Over a ­period of time, the speed will vary 
from almost zero to some very high value, ­considerably above the average.
In 1860 James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist and one of the greatest ­theoreticians 
the world has ever known, showed that different possible speeds are distributed among 
particles in a definite way. Indeed, he developed a mathematical expression for this dis-
tribution. His results are shown graphically in Figure 5.10 for O2 at 258C and 10008C. On 
the graph, the relative number of molecules having a certain speed is plotted against that 
speed. At 258C, this number increases rapidly with the speed, up to a maximum of about 
400 m/s. This is the most probable speed of an oxygen molecule at 258C. Above about 
400 m/s, the number of molecules moving at any particular speed decreases. For speeds 
in excess of about 1600 m/s, the fraction of molecules drops off to nearly zero. In general, 
most molecules have speeds rather close to the average value.
As temperature increases, the speed of the molecules increases. The distribution curve 
for molecular speeds (Figure 5.10) shifts to the right and becomes broader. The chance of a 
molecule having a very high speed is much greater at 10008C than at 258C. Note, for ex-
ample, that a large number of molecules has speeds greater than 1600 m/s at 10008C;

almost none have that speed at 258C. The general principle here is one that we will find very 
useful when we look at the effect of temperature on reaction rate in Chapter 11.

5.7 Real Gases
In this chapter, the ideal gas law has been used in all calculations, with the ­assumption 
that it applies exactly. Under ordinary conditions, this assumption is a good one; how-
ever, all real gases deviate at least slightly from the ideal gas law. Table 5.2 shows the ex-
tent to which two gases, O2 and CO2, deviate from ideality at different temperatures and 
pressures. The data compare the experimentally ­observed molar volume, Vm

5.7  REAL GASES
It should be obvious from Table 5.2 that deviations from ideality become larger at 
high pressures and low temperatures. Moreover, the deviations are larger for CO2 than for 
O2. All of these effects can be correlated in terms of a simple, common-sense 
observation:
In general, the closer a gas is to the liquid state, the more it will deviate from the ideal gas law.
A gas is liquefied by going to low temperatures and/or high pressures. Moreover, as 
you can see from Table 5.2, carbon dioxide is much easier to liquefy than oxygen.
From a molecular standpoint, deviations from the ideal gas law arise because it  
neglects two factors:
	 1.	 attractive forces between gas particles.
	 2.	 the finite volume of gas particles.
We will now consider in turn the effect of these two factors on the molar volumes of real 
gases.
Attractive Forces
Notice that in Table 5.2 all the deviations are negative; the observed molar volume is less 
than that predicted by the ideal gas law. This effect can be attributed to ­attractive forces 
between gas particles. These forces tend to pull the particles toward one another, reduc-
ing the space between them. As a result, the particles are crowded into a smaller volume, 
just as if an additional external pressure were applied. The observed molar volume, Vm, 
becomes less than V8m, and the deviation from ideality is negative:
Vm 2 V +m
V +m
 , 0
The magnitude of this effect depends on the strength of the attractive forces and hence 
on the nature of the gas. Intermolecular attractive forces are stronger in CO2 than they are 
in O2, which explains why the deviation from ideality of Vm is greater with carbon dioxide 
and why carbon dioxide is more readily condensed to a liquid than is oxygen.
Particle Volume
Figure 5.11 shows a plot of Vm/V8m versus pressure for methane at 258C. Up to about 
150 atm, methane shows a steadily increasing negative deviation from ideality, as might 
be expected on the basis of attractive forces. At 150 atm, Vm is only about 70% of V8m.
At very high pressures, methane behaves quite differently. Above 150 atm, the ratio 
Vm/V8m increases, becoming 1 at about 350 atm. Above that pressure, methane shows a 
positive deviation from the ideal gas law:

effect of the attractive forces is just 
­balanced by that of the finite ­volume 
of CH4 molecules, and the gas appears 
to ­behave ideally. Above 350 atm,

chApter FIVe  Gases
Th is eff ect is by no means unique to methane; it is observed with all gases. If the data in 
Table 5.2 are extended to very high pressures, oxygen and carbon dioxide behave like 
methane; Vm becomes larger than V8m.
An increase in molar volume above that predicted by the ideal gas law is related to 
the fi nite volume of gas particles. Th ese particles contribute to the  observed volume, 
making Vm greater than V8m. Ordinarily, this eff ect becomes evident only at high pres-
sures, where the particles are quite close to one  another.
Measurement of Blood Pressure
one of the fi rst things that a nurse does when you visit your doctor is 
take your blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. A condition of 
elevated blood pressure is called hypertension and can be a major factor 
in heart attacks and strokes. How does a sphygmomanometer work? 
When the heart contracts and relaxes, it pumps blood through 
the arteries in the body. The pressure exerted by the blood on the 
walls of the artery can be measured in the same way as the pres-
sure of a column of air or water. 
blood pressure is measured by a special type of manometer 
called a sphygmomanometer. It consists of a cuff  and a device that 
infl ates an air bladder inside the cuff , which in turn restricts the 
fl ow of blood through an artery, together with a device that dis-
plays the pressure measured. Commonly, the cuff  is placed at about 
heart level on the upper arm, just above the elbow, with the arm 
held in a relaxed position against a supporting table or bench. The 
cuff  is infl ated to a pressure above that of the blood being pumped 
by the heart, which cuts off  the fl ow of blood through the artery. 
The pressure in the cuff  is then slowly reduced. 
As the cuff  is defl ated, a “whooshing” sound, called a Korotkoff  
sound, is detected by using a stethoscope pressed against the 
brachial artery (the artery that runs from your elbow to your shoul-
der). The sound results 
from the restoration 
of blood fl ow through 
the artery as the pres-
sure opposing it in 
the cuff  is relaxed. 
When two consecutive 
sounds are heard, the 
pressure 
reading 
is 
taken from the mea-
suring device. This is 
called 
the 
systolic 
pressure reading. This 
reading 
corresponds 
to the cycle where the 
heart is contracting in 
response to an electri-
cal stimulus. 
CHemISTRy beYonD the clASSrooM
Further defl ation of the cuff  leads to several more Korotkoff  
sounds, ultimately ending in silence as the pressure in the cuff  drops 
below the diastolic blood pressure. The disappearance of sound deter-
mines the lower of the two readings that comprise a blood pressure 
measurement—the diastolic reading. The diastolic reading corre-
sponds to the cycle where the heart is relaxing following its 
contraction. 
The standard in sphygmomanometers uses a column of 
mercury, exactly as a mercury barometer does. It requires a sepa-
rate stethoscope and a trained ear for proper operation. Another 
type of device is called an aneroid sphygmomanometer, which uses 
an analog gauge that is calibrated against a mercury column.
even more common today are digital sphygmomanometers, 
which require no external listening device for the Korotkoff  sounds. 
The cuff  includes a microphone that is connected to a micropro-
cessor and has an automatic infl ator with a pressure sensor con-
nected to an air pump. At the press of a button, the cuff  infl ates and 
defl ates under computer control, and the reading is taken and pro-
cessed by the computer chip. These devices measure the mean 
arterial pressure, which is then processed mathematically to give 
the systolic and diastolic readings. These are then displayed on a 
digital panel. blood pressure readings are commonly reported as 
even numbers, and in units of millimeters of mercury. Although 
they are easy to use, digital sphygmomanometers are not suitable 
for all blood pressure measurements. Some conditions can render 
their readings signifi cantly inaccurate.
other types of sphygmomanometers include those that can be 
placed around a fi nger. They are easier to use but are less accurate 
than other types of blood pressure measuring devices.

n Chapter 2 we briefly considered the structure of the atom. You will recall that every 
atom has a tiny, positively charged nucleus, consisting of protons and neutrons. The  
nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The number of protons in the nu-
cleus is characteristic of the atoms of a particular ­element and is referred to as the atomic 
number. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons and 
hence to the atomic number.
In this chapter, we focus on electron arrangements in atoms, paying particular  
attention to the relative energies of different electrons (energy levels) and their ­spatial locations 
(orbi­tals). Specifically, we consider the nature of the energy levels and orbitals available to
• the single electron in the hydrogen atom (Section 6.2).
• the several electrons in more complex atoms (Sections 6.3, 6.4).
With this background, we show how electron arrangements in multielectron atoms 
and the monatomic ions derived from them can be described in terms of
• electron configurations, which show the number of electrons in each energy level 
(Sections 6.5, 6.7).
• orbital diagrams, which show the arrangement of electrons within orbitals (Sections 
6.6, 6.7).

chapter SIX  Electronic Structure and the Periodic Table
The electron configuration or orbital diagram of an atom of an element can be deduced 
from its position in the periodic table. Beyond that, position in the table can predict (Section 
6.8) the relative sizes of atoms and ions (atomic ­radius, ionic radius) and the relative tenden-
cies of atoms to give up or acquire ­electrons (ionization energy, electronegativity).
Before dealing with electronic structures as such, it is helpful to examine briefly the 
experimental evidence on which such structures are based (Section 6.1). In particular, we 
need to look at the phenomenon of atomic spectra.
6.1 Light, Photon Energies, and Atomic Spectra
Fireworks displays are fascinating to watch. Neon lights and sodium vapor lamps 
can transform the skyline of a city with their brilliant colors. The eerie phenomenon 
of the aurora borealis is an unforgettable experience when you see it for the first 
time. All of these events relate to the generation of light and its transmission through 
space.
The Wave Nature of Light: Wavelength and Frequency
Light travels through space as a wave, consisting of successive crests, which rise above 
the midline, and troughs, which sink below it. Waves have three primary characteristics 
(Figure 6.1), two of which are of particular interest at this point:
 1.	 Wavelength (l), the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs, most often 
measured in meters or nanometers (1 nm 5 1029 m).
 2. Frequency (n), the number of wave cycles (successive crests or troughs) that pass a given 
point in unit time. If 108 cycles pass a particular point in one second,
n 5 108/s 5 108 Hz
The frequency unit hertz (Hz) represents one cycle per second.
The speed at which a wave moves through space can be found by multiplying the 
length of a wave cycle (l) by the number of cycles passing a point in unit time (n). For 
light,
 
ln 5 c 
(6.1)
where c, the speed of light in a vacuum, is 2.998 3 108 m/s. To use this equation with this 
value of c—
•	 l should be expressed in meters.
•	 n should be expressed in reciprocal seconds (hertz).
Chemical properties of atoms and  
molecules depend on their ­electronic 
structures.
l is the Greek letter lambda; n is the 
Greek letter nu.

Light visible to the eye is only a tiny portion of the entire electromagnetic spectrum 
(Figure 6.2, page 157) covering only the narrow wavelength region from 400 to 700 nm. For 
a substance to be colored, it must absorb somewhere within this region. Ozone in the up-
per atmosphere absorbs harmful, high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. 
Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared (IR) radiation given off by the earth’s surface, preventing 
it from escaping into the outer atmosphere, thereby contributing to global warming. Mi-
crowave ovens produce radiation at wavelengths longer than infrared radiation, whereas 
x-rays have wavelengths shorter than UV radiation (Figure 6.2, page 157).
Some of the substances you work with in general chemistry can be identified at least 
tentatively by their color. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a brown color; ­vapors of bro-
mine and iodine are red and violet, respectively. A water solution of copper sulfate is 
blue, and a solution of potassium permanganate is purple (Figure 6.3).
The colors of gases and liquids are due to the selective absorption of certain compo-
nents of visible light. Bromine, for example, absorbs in the violet and blue regions of the 
spectrum (Table 6.1). The subtraction of these components from ­visible light accounts 
for the red color of bromine liquid or vapor. The purple (blue-red) color of a potassium 
permanganate solution results from absorption in the green region (Figure 6.4).

6.1  light, photon energies, and atomic spectra
The Particle Nature of Light; Photon Energies
A hundred years ago it was generally supposed that all the properties of light could be 
explained in terms of its wave nature. A series of investigations carried out ­between 
1900 and 1910 by Max Planck (1858–1947) (blackbody radiation) and Albert Einstein 
(1879–1955) (photoelectric effect) discredited that notion. Today we ­consider light to 
be generated as a stream of particles called photons, whose energy E is given by the 
equation
 
E 5 hn 5 hc/l 
(6.2)
Throughout this text, we will use the SI unit joule (J), 1 kg · m2/s2, to express energy. 
A joule is a rather small quantity. One joule of electrical energy would keep a 10-W light-
bulb burning for only a tenth of a second. For that reason, we will often express energies 
in kilojoules (1 kJ 5 103 J). The quantity h appearing in Planck’s equation is referred to as 
Planck’s constant.
h 5 6.626 3 10234 J · s
Notice from this equation that energy is inversely related to wavelength. This explains 
why you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from UV solar radiation (,400 nm) and a 
“lead apron” when dental x-rays (,10 nm) are being taken. ­Conversely, IR (.700 nm) and 
microwave photons (.80,000 nm) are of relatively low energy (but don’t try walking on 
hot coals).

wire held in a flame colors the flame

many photons of the sodium lamp emissions are needed to “see” the yellow light?

In part (a), 3.37 3 10219 J may seem like a tiny amount of energy, but bear in mind that it comes from a single photon. 
2. 
In part (b), the energy calculated for one mole of photons, 203 kJ, is roughly comparable to the energy effects in 
chemical reactions. About 240 kJ of heat is evolved when a mole of hydrogen gas burns (more on this in Chapter 8).
3. 
In part (c), note that not too many photons are needed to sense light.
Atomic Spectra
In the seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton showed that visible (white) light from the 
Sun can be broken down into its various color components by a prism. The spectrum 
obtained is continuous; it contains essentially all wavelengths ­between 400 and 700 nm.
The situation with high-energy atoms of gaseous elements is quite ­ differ­ent (Figure 
6.5, page 161). Here the spectrum consists of discrete lines given off at ­specific ­wavelengths. 
Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can be used to identify it. In the case of 
sodium, there are two strong lines in the yellow region at 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm. These 
lines account for the yellow color of sodium ­vapor lamps used to illuminate highways.
Atomic spectroscopy can identify 
metals at concentrations as low as 
1027 mol/L.

6.2  the hydrogen atom

lengths implies that they can have only certain discrete energies, because

Since these photons are produced when an electron moves from one energy level to an-
other, the electronic energy levels in an atom must be quantized, that is, limited to par-
ticular values. Moreover, it would seem that by measuring the spectrum of an element it 
should be possible to unravel its electronic energy levels. This is indeed possible, but it 
isn’t easy. Gaseous atoms typically give off hundreds, even thousands, of spectral lines.
One of the simplest of atomic spectra, and the most important from a theoretical 
standpoint, is that of hydrogen. When energized by a high-voltage discharge, gaseous 
hydrogen atoms emit radiation at wavelengths that can be grouped into several different 
series (Table 6.2). The first of these to be discovered, the Balmer ­series, lies partly in the 
visible region. It consists of a strong line at 656.28 nm followed by successively weaker 
lines, closer and closer together, at lower wavelengths.
6.2 The Hydrogen Atom
The hydrogen atom, containing a single electron, has played a major role in the devel-
opment of models of electronic structure. In 1913 Niels Bohr (1885–1962), a Danish 
physicist, offered a theoretical explanation of the atomic spectrum of ­hydrogen. His 
model was based largely on classical mechanics. In 1922 this model earned him the 
Nobel Prize in physics. By that time, Bohr had become director of the Institute of 
Theoretical Physics at Copenhagen. There, he helped develop the new discipline of 
quantum mechanics, used by other scientists to construct a more sophisticated model 
for the hydrogen atom.
Bohr, like all the other individuals mentioned in this chapter, was not a chemist. His 
only real contact with chemistry came as an undergraduate at the University of Copen-

ing companion, recalled that Bohr set a record for broken glassware that lasted half a 
century.
Bohr Model
Bohr assumed that a hydrogen atom consists of a central proton about which an electron 
moves in a circular orbit. He related the electrostatic force of attraction of the proton for the 
electron to the centrifugal force due to the circular motion of the electron. In this way, Bohr 
was able to express the energy of the atom in terms of the radius of the electron’s orbit. To 
this point, his analysis was purely classical, based on Coulomb’s law of electrostatic attrac-
tion and Newton’s laws of motion. To progress beyond this point, Bohr boldly and arbi-
trarily assumed, in effect, that the electron in the hydrogen atom can have only certain defi-
nite energies. Using arguments that we will not go into, Bohr obtained the following equation 
for the energy of the hydrogen electron:
 
En 5 2RH/n2 
(6.3)
where En is the energy of the electron, RH is a quantity called the Rydberg constant 
(modern value 5 2.180 3 10218 J), and n is an integer called the principal quantum 
number. Depending on the state of the electron, n can have any positive, integral value, 
that is,
n 5 1, 2, 3, . . .
Before proceeding with the Bohr model, let us make three points:
1.  In setting up his model, Bohr designated zero energy as the point at which the proton 
and electron are completely separated. Energy has to be absorbed to reach that point. This 
means that the electron, in all its allowed energy states within the atom, must have an energy 
below zero; that is, it must be negative, hence the minus sign in the equation:
En 5 2RH/n2
2.  Ordinarily the hydrogen electron is in its lowest energy state, referred to as the 
ground state or ground level, for which n 5 1. When an electron absorbs enough energy, it 
moves to a higher, excited state. In a hydrogen atom, the first excited state has n 5 2, the 
second n 5 3, and so on.
3.  When an excited electron gives off energy as a photon of light, it drops back to a lower 
energy state. The electron can return to the ground state (from n 5 2 to n 5 1, for example) 
or to a lower excited state (from n 5 3 to n 5 2). In every case, the energy of the photon (hn) 
evolved is equal to the difference in energy between the two states:
DE 5 hn 5 Ehi 2 Elo
where Ehi and Elo are the energies of the higher and lower states, respectively.
Using this expression for DE and the equation En 5 2RH/n2, it is possible to 
relate the frequency of the light emitted to the quantum numbers, nhi and nlo, of the two 
states:

atom. Given

6.2  the hydrogen atom
All of the lines in the Balmer series (Table 6.2) come from transitions to the level 
n 5 2 from higher levels (n 5 3, 4, 5,  .  .  .  ). Similarly, lines in the Lyman ­series arise 
when electrons fall to the n 5 1 level from higher levels (n 5 2, 3, 4,  .  .  .). For the 
Paschen series, which lies in the infrared, the lower level is always n 5 3.
Quantum Mechanical Model
Bohr’s theory for the structure of the hydrogen atom was highly successful. Scientists of the 
day must have thought they were on the verge of being able to predict the allowed energy 
levels of all atoms. However, the extension of Bohr’s ideas to atoms with two or more elec-
trons gave, at best, only qualitative agreement with ­experiment. Consider, for example, 
what happens when Bohr’s theory is applied to the helium atom. For helium, the errors in 
calculated energies and wavelengths are of the order of 5% instead of the 0.1% error with 
hydrogen. There appeared to be no way the theory could be modified to make it work well 
with helium or other atoms. Indeed, it soon became apparent that there was a fundamental 
problem with the Bohr model. The idea of an electron moving about the nucleus in a ­ well-
defined orbit at a fixed distance from the nucleus had to be abandoned.
Scientists in the 1920s, speculating on this problem, became convinced that an en-
tirely new approach was required to treat electrons in atoms and molecules. In 1924 a 
young French scientist, Louis de Broglie (1892–1987), in his doctoral dissertation at the 
Sorbonne, made a revolutionary suggestion. He reasoned that if light could show the

behavior of particles (photons) as well as waves, then perhaps an electron, which Bohr 
had treated as a particle, could behave like a wave. In a few years, de Broglie’s postulate 
was confirmed experimentally. This led to the development of a whole new discipline, 
first called wave mechanics, more commonly known today as quantum mechanics.
The quantum mechanical atom differs from the Bohr model in several ways. In par-
ticular, according to quantum mechanics—
•	 the kinetic energy of an electron is inversely related to the volume of the region to 
which it is confined. This phenomenon has no analog in classical mechanics, but it 
helps to explain the stability of the hydrogen atom. Consider what happens when an 
electron moves closer and closer to the nucleus. The electrostatic ­energy decreases; 
that is, it becomes more negative. If this were the only factor, the electron should radi-
ate energy and “fall” into the nucleus. However, the ­kinetic energy is increasing at the 
same time, because the electron is moving within a smaller and smaller volume. The 
two effects oppose each other; at some point a balance is reached and the atom is 
stable.
•	 it is impossible to specify the precise position of an electron in an atom at a given 
instant. Neither can we describe in detail the path that an electron takes about the 
nucleus. (After all, if we can’t say where the electron is, we certainly don’t know how 
it got there.) The best we can do is to estimate the probability of finding the electron 
within a particular region.
In 1926 Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961), an Austrian physicist, made a major con-
tribution to quantum mechanics. He wrote down a rather complex differential equa-
tion to express the wave properties of an electron in an atom. This equation can be 
solved, at least in principle, to find the amplitude (height) c of the electron wave at 
various points in space. The quantity c (psi) is known as the wave function. Although 
we will not use the Schrödinger wave equation in any calculations, you should realize 
that much of our discussion of electronic structure is based on ­solutions to that equa-
tion for the electron in the hydrogen atom.
For the hydrogen electron, the square of the wave function, c2, is directly 
­proportional to the probability of finding the electron at a particular point. If c2 at point 
A is twice as large as at point B, then we are twice as likely to find the electron at A as at 
B. Putting it another way, over time the electron will turn up at A twice as ­often as at B.
Figure 6.6a, an electron cloud diagram, shows how c2 for the hydrogen electron in 
its ground state (n 5 1) varies moving out from the nucleus. The depth of the color is

6.3  quantum numbers
supposed to be directly proportional to c2 and hence to the probability of finding the 
electron at a point. As you can see, the color fades moving out from the nucleus in any 
direction; the value of c2 drops accordingly.
Another, more common way of showing the electron distribution in the ground 
state of the hydrogen atom is to draw the orbital (Figure 6.6b, page 164) within which 
there is a 90% chance of finding the electron. Notice that the orbital is spherical, which 
means that the probability is independent of direction; the ­electron is equally likely to be 
found north, south, east, or west of the nucleus.
6.3 Quantum Numbers
The Schrödinger equation can be solved approximately for atoms with two or more elec-
trons. There are many solutions for the wave function, c, each associated with a set of 
numbers called quantum numbers. Three such numbers are given the symbols n, ,, and 
m,. A wave function corresponding to a particular set of three quantum numbers (e.g., 
n 5 2, , 5 1, m, 5 0) is associated with an electron ­occupying an atomic orbital. From the 
expression for c, we can deduce the relative energy of that orbital, its shape, and its orienta-
tion in space.
For reasons we will discuss later, a fourth quantum number is required to ­completely 
describe a specific electron in a multielectron atom. The fourth quantum number is  
given the symbol ms. Each electron in an atom has a set of four quantum numbers: n, ,, 
m,, and ms. We will now discuss the quantum numbers of electrons as they are used in 
atoms beyond hydrogen.
First Quantum Number, n; Principal Energy Levels
The first quantum number, given the symbol n, is of primary importance in ­determining 
the energy of an electron. For the hydrogen atom, the energy ­depends upon only n (re-
call Equation 6.3). In other atoms, the energy of each electron ­depends mainly, but not 
completely, upon the value of n. As n increases, the ­energy of the electron increases and, 
on the average, it is found farther out from the ­nucleus. The quantum number n can take 
on only integral values, starting with 1:
 
n 5 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . 
(6.5)
An electron for which n 5 1 is said to be in the first principal level. If n 5 2, we are deal-
ing with the second principal level, and so on.
Second Quantum Number, ; Sublevels (s, p, d, f)
Each principal energy level includes one or more sublevels. The sublevels are denoted by 
the second quantum number, ,. As we will see later, the general shape of the electron 
cloud associated with an electron is determined by ,. Larger values of , produce more 
complex shapes. The quantum numbers n and , are related; , can take on any integral 
value starting with 0 and going up to a maximum of (n 2 1). That is,
 
, 5 0, 1, 2, . . . , (n 2 1) 
(6.6)
If n 5 1, there is only one possible value of ,—namely 0. This means that, in the first 
principal level, there is only one sublevel, for which , 5 0. If n 5 2, two values of , are 
possible, 0 and 1. In other words, there are two sublevels (, 5 0 and ,5 1) within the 
second principal energy level. In the same way,
	
if n 5 3:	
, 5 0, 1, or 2	
(three sublevels)
if n 5 4:    , 5 0, 1, 2, or 3    (four sublevels)
In general, in the nth principal level, there are n different sublevels.
Seems strange, but an electron is more 
likely to be found at the ­nucleus than 
at any other point.
This relation between n and , comes 
from the Schrödinger ­equation.

166
 
chapter SIX  Electronic Structure and the Periodic Table
Another method is commonly used to designate sublevels. Instead of giving the 
quantum number ,, the letters s, p, d, or f* indicate the sublevels , 5 0, 1, 2, or 3, respec-
tively. That is,
quantum number, ,    0  1  2  3
	
type of sublevel	
s	 p	 d	 f
Usually, in designating a sublevel, a number is included (Table 6.3) to indicate the 
principal level as well. Thus reference is made to a 1s sublevel (n 5 1, , 5 0), a 2s sublevel 
(n 5 2, , 5 0), a 2p sublevel (n 5 2, , 5 1), and so on.
For atoms containing more than one electron, the energy is dependent on , as well 
as n. Within a given principal level (same value of n), sublevels increase in energy in the 
order
ns , np , nd , nf
Thus a 2p sublevel has a slightly higher energy than a 2s sublevel. By the same ­token, 
when n 5 3, the 3s sublevel has the lowest energy, the 3p is intermediate, and the 3d has 
the highest energy.
Third Quantum Number, m; Orbitals
Each sublevel contains one or more orbitals, which differ from one another in the value 
assigned to the third quantum number, m,. This quantum number determines the di-
rection in space of the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus. The value of m, is re-
lated to that of ,. For a given value of ,, m, can have any integral value, including 0, 
between , and 2,, that is
 
m, 5 ,, . . . , 11, 0, 21, . . . , 2, 
(6.7)
To illustrate how this rule works, consider an s sublevel (, 5 0). Here m, can have 
only one value, 0. This means that an s sublevel contains only one orbital, ­referred to as 
an s orbital. For a p orbital (, 5 1) m, 5 1, 0, or 21. Within a given p sublevel there are 
three different orbitals described by the quantum numbers m, 5 1,  0, and 21. All three 
of these orbitals have the same energy.
For the d and f sublevels
	
d sublevel:	
, 5 2    m, 5 2, 1, 0, 21, 22	
5 orbitals
f sublevel:    , 5 3    m, 5 3, 2, 1, 0, 21, 22, 23    7 orbitals
Here again all the orbitals in a given d or f sublevel have the same energy.
Fourth Quantum Number, ms; Electron Spin
The fourth quantum number, ms, is associated with electron spin. An electron has mag-
netic properties that correspond to those of a charged particle spinning on its axis. Either 
of two spins is possible, clockwise or counterclockwise (Figure 6.7).
The quantum number ms was introduced to make theory consistent with ­experiment. 
In that sense, it differs from the first three quantum numbers, which came from the solu-
tion to the Schrödinger wave equation for the hydrogen atom. This quantum number is 
not related to n, ,, or m,. It can have either of two possible values:

6.3  quantum numbers
Electrons that have the same value of ms (i.e., both 11
2 or both 21
2) are said to have 
parallel spins. Electrons that have different ms values (i.e., one 11
2 and the other 21
2) are 
said to have opposed spins.
Pauli Exclusion Principle
The four quantum numbers that characterize an electron in an atom have now been con-
sidered. There is an important rule, called the Pauli exclusion principle, that relates to 
these numbers. It requires that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four 
quantum numbers. This principle was first stated in 1925 by ­Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958), a 
colleague of Bohr, again to make theory consistent with the properties of atoms.
The Pauli exclusion principle has an implication that is not obvious at first glance. It 
requires that only two electrons can fit into an orbital, since there are only two possible 
values of ms. Moreover, if two electrons occupy the same ­orbital, they must have op-
posed spins. Otherwise they would have the same set of four quantum numbers.
The rules for assigning quantum numbers are summarized in Table 6.4 and ­applied 
in Examples 6.4 and 6.5.

6.4 Atomic Orbitals; Shapes and Sizes
You will recall (page 164) that an orbital occupied by an electron in an atom can be rep-
resented physically by showing the region of space in which there is a 90% probability of 
finding the electron. Orbitals are commonly designated by citing the corresponding sub-
levels. Thus we refer to 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, . . .  orbitals.
All s sublevels are spherical; they differ from one another only in size. As n increases, 
the radius of the orbital becomes larger (Figure 6.8). This means that an electron in a  
2s orbital is more likely to be found far out from the nucleus than is a 1s electron.

The shapes and orientations of p orbitals are shown in Figure 6.9. Notice that

that is, at the nucleus of the atom.
•	 the three p orbitals in a given sublevel are oriented at right angles to one another 
along the x-, y-, and z-axis. For that reason, the three orbitals are often designated as 
px, py, and pz.
Although it is not shown in Figure 6.9, p orbitals, like s orbitals, increase in size as 
the principal quantum number n increases. Also not shown are the shapes and sizes of 
d and f orbitals. We will say more about the nature of d orbitals in Chapter 19.
6.5 Electron Configurations in Atoms
Given the rules referred to in Section 6.3, it is possible to assign quantum numbers to 
each electron in an atom. Beyond that, electrons can be assigned to specific principal 
levels, sublevels, and orbitals. There are several ways to do this. Perhaps the simplest way 
to describe the arrangement of electrons in an atom is to give its electron ­configuration, 
which shows the number of electrons, indicated by a superscript, in each sublevel. For 
example, a species with the electron configuration
1s22s22p5
has two electrons in the 1s sublevel, two electrons in the 2s sublevel, and five ­electrons in 
the 2p sublevel.
In this section, you will learn how to predict the electron configurations of atoms 
of elements. There are a couple of different ways of doing this, which we consider in 
turn. It should be emphasized that, throughout this discussion, we refer to isolated gas-
eous atoms in the ground state. (In excited states, one or more ­electrons are promoted to 
a higher energy level.)
Electron Configuration from Sublevel Energies
Electron configurations are readily obtained if the order of filling sublevels is known. 
Electrons enter the available sublevels in order of increasing sublevel ­energy. Ordinarily, 
a sublevel is filled to capacity before the next one starts to fill. The relative energies of 
different sublevels can be obtained from experiment. Figure 6.10 (page 170) is a plot of 
these energies for atoms through the n 5 4 principal level.
From Figure 6.10 (page 170) it is possible to predict the electron configurations of 
atoms of elements with atomic numbers 1 through 36. Because an s sublevel can hold 
only two electrons, the 1s is filled at helium (1s2). With lithium (Z 5 3), the third ­electron 
has to enter a new sublevel: This is the 2s, the lowest sublevel of the ­second principal 
energy level. Lithium has one electron in this sublevel (1s22s1). With beryllium (Z 5 4),

Beyond neon, electrons enter the third principal level. The 3s sublevel is filled at 
magnesium:
12Mg    1s22s22p63s2
Six more electrons are required to fill the 3p sublevel with argon:
18Ar    1s22s22p63s23p6
After argon, an “overlap” of principal energy levels occurs. The next electron enters 
the lowest sublevel of the fourth principal level (4s) instead of the highest sublevel of the 
third principal level (3d). Potassium (Z 5 19) has one electron in the 4s sublevel; calcium 
(Z 5 20) fills it with two electrons:
20Ca    1s22s22p63s23p64s2
Now the 3d sublevel starts to fill with scandium (Z 5 21). Recall that a d sublevel has a 
capacity of ten electrons. Hence the 3d sublevel becomes filled at zinc (Z 5 30):
30Zn    1s22s22p63s23p64s23d10

Filling of Sublevels and the Periodic Table
In principle, a diagram such as Figure 6.10 (page 170) can be extended to include all sub-
levels occupied by electrons in any element. As a matter of fact, that is a relatively ­simple 
thing to do; such a diagram is in effect incorporated into the periodic table ­introduced 
in Chapter 2.
To understand how position in the periodic table relates to the filling of ­sublevels, 
consider the metals in the first two groups. Atoms of the Group 1 ­elements all have one s 
electron in the outermost principal energy level (Table 6.5). In each Group 2 atom, there 
are two s electrons in the outermost level. A similar relationship applies to the elements 
in any group:
The atoms of elements in a group of the periodic table have the same distribution of elec-
trons in the outermost principal energy level.

    S: atomic number 5 16; Fe: atomic number 5 26

chapter SIX  Electronic Structure and the Periodic Table
Th is means that the order in which electron sublevels are fi lled is determined by position 
in the periodic table. Figure 6.11 shows how this works. Notice the following points:
1. The elements in Groups 1 and 2 are ﬁ lling an s sublevel. Thus Li and Be in the second 
period fi ll the 2s sublevel. Na and Mg in the third period fi ll the 3s sublevel, and so on.
2. The elements in Groups 13 through 18 (six elements in each period) ﬁ ll p sublevels,
which have a capacity of six electrons. In the second period, the 2p  sublevel starts to fi ll with 
B (Z 5 5) and is completed with Ne (Z 5 10). In the third period, the elements Al (Z 5 13) 
through Ar (Z 5 18) fi ll the 3p sublevel.
3. The transition metals, in the center of the periodic table, ﬁ ll d sublevels. Remember that 
a d sublevel can hold ten electrons. In the fourth period, the ten elements Sc (Z 5 21) through 
Zn (Z 5 30) fi ll the 3d sublevel. In the fi fth period, the 4d sublevel is fi lled by the elements Y 
(Z 5 39) through Cd (Z 5 48). The ten transition metals in the sixth period fi ll the 5d sublevel. 
Elements 103 to 112 in the seventh period are believed to be fi lling the 6d sublevel.
4. The two sets of 14 elements listed separately at the bottom of the table are ﬁ lling f 
sublevels with a principal quantum number two less than the period number. That is,
• 14 elements in the sixth period (Z 5 57 to 70) are fi lling the 4f sublevel. Th ese  elements 
are sometimes called rare earths or, more commonly, lanthanides,  aft er the name of 
the fi rst element in the series, lanthanum (La). Modern separation techniques, nota-
bly chromatography, have greatly increased the availability of compounds of these 
elements. A brilliant red phosphor used in color TV receivers contains a small amount 
of europium oxide, Eu2O3. Th is is added to yttrium oxide, Y2O3, or gadolinium oxide,

where it prevents the buildup of tar deposits.
• 14 elements in the seventh period (Z 5 89 to 102) are fi lling the 5f sublevel. Th e fi rst 
element in this series is actinium (Ac); collectively, these elements are  referred to as 
actinides. All these elements are radioactive; only thorium and uranium occur in 
nature. Th e other actinides have been synthesized in the  laboratory by nuclear reac-
tions. Th eir stability decreases rapidly with increasing atomic number. Th e longest 
lived isotope of nobelium (102No) has a half-life of about 3 minutes; that is, in 3 min-
utes half of the sample decomposes. Nobelium and the preceding element, mendele-
vium (101Md), were identifi ed in samples containing one to three atoms of No or Md.
Electron Configuration from the Periodic Table
Figure 6.11 (page 172) (or any periodic table) can be used to deduce the electron 
configuration of any element. It is particularly useful for heavier elements such as 
iodine (Example 6.7).
one name, more than any other, is associ-
ated with the actinide elements: Glenn 
Seaborg (1912–1999). Between 1940 and 
1957, Seaborg and his team at the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley, prepared nine 
of these elements (at. no. 94–102) for the 
fi rst time. moreover, in 1945 Seaborg made 
the revolutionary suggestion that the 
 actinides, like the lanthanides, were fi lling 
an f sublevel. For these accomplishments, 
he received the 1951 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry.
Glenn Seaborg was born in a small town 
in middle America, Ishpeming, michigan. 
After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in 
chemistry from UClA, he spent the rest of 
his scientifi c career at Berkeley, fi rst as a 
Ph.d. student and then as a faculty member. 
during World War II, he worked on the 
manhattan Project. Along with other scien-
tists, Seaborg recommended that the dev-
astating power of the atomic bomb be 
demonstrated by dropping it on a barren 
island before United Nations observers. 
later he headed the U.S. Atomic energy 
Commission under Presidents Kennedy, 
Johnson, and Nixon.
Sometimes referred to as the “gentle 
giant” (he was 6 ft 4 in. tall), Seaborg had a 
charming, self-deprecating sense of humor. 
He recalled that friends advised him not to 
publish his theory about the position of the 
actinides in the periodic table, lest it ruin 
his scientifi c reputation. Seaborg went on 
to say that, “I had a great advantage. I didn’t 
have any scientifi c reputation, so I went 
ahead and published it.” late in his life 
there was considerable controversy as to 
whether a transuranium element should be 
named for him; that honor had always been 
bestowed posthumously. Seaborg com-
mented wryly that, “They don’t want to do 
it because I’m still alive and they can prove 
it.” element 106 was named seaborgium 
(Sg) in 1997; he considered this his greatest 
honor, even above the Nobel Prize.

chapter SIX  Electronic Structure and the Periodic Table
As you can see from Figure 6.11 (page 172), the electron configurations of several ele-
ments (marked *) differ slightly from those predicted. In every case, the difference in-
volves a shift of one or, at the most, two electrons from one sublevel to another of very 
similar energy. For example, in the first transition series, two elements, chromium and 
copper, have an extra electron in the 3d as compared with the 4s orbital.

24Cr

These anomalies reflect the fact that the 3d and 4s orbitals have very similar energies. 
Beyond that, it has been suggested that there is a slight increase in stability with a half-
filled (Cr) or completely filled (Cu) 3d sublevel.
6.6 	Orbital Diagrams of Atoms
For many purposes, electron configurations are sufficient to describe the arrangements 
of electrons in atoms. Sometimes, however, it is useful to go a step further and show how 
electrons are distributed among orbitals. In such cases, orbital diagrams are used. Each 
orbital is represented by parentheses ( ), and electrons are shown by arrows written q or 
p, depending on spin.
To show how orbital diagrams are obtained from electron configurations, consider 
the boron atom (Z 5 5). Its electron configuration is 1s22s22p1. The pair of electrons in 
the 1s orbital must have opposed spins (11
2, 21
2, or qp). The same is true of the two elec-
trons in the 2s orbital. There are three orbitals in the 2p ­sublevel. The single 2p electron

Check your answer by adding all the electrons (superscripts) in your electron configuration. Your answer must equal the

in boron could be in any one of these orbitals. Its spin could be either “up” or “down.” The

5B        (qp)        (qp)        (q) (  ) (  )
with the first electron in an orbital arbitrarily designated by an up arrow, q.
With the next element, carbon, a complication arises. In which orbital should the 
sixth electron go? It could go in the same orbital as the other 2p electron, in which case 
it would have to have the opposite spin, p. It could go into one of the other two orbitals, 
either with a parallel spin, q, or an opposed spin, p. Experiment shows that there is an 
energy difference among these arrangements. The most stable is the one in which the 
two electrons are in different orbitals with parallel spins. The orbital diagram of the car-
bon atom is

2s	
2p
 6C        (qp)        (qp)        (q) (q) (  )
Similar situations arise frequently. There is a general principle that applies in all 
such cases; Hund’s rule (Friedrich Hund, 1896–1997) predicts that, ordinarily,
when several orbitals of equal energy are available, as in a given sublevel, electrons enter 
singly with parallel spins.
Only after all the orbitals are half-filled do electrons pair up in orbitals.
Following this principle, the orbital diagrams for the elements boron through neon 
are shown in Figure 6.12. Notice that
•	 in all filled orbitals, the two electrons have opposed spins. Such electrons are often 
referred to as being paired. There are four paired electrons in the B, C, and N atoms, 
six in the oxygen atom, eight in the fluorine atom, and ten in the neon atom.
•	 in accordance with Hund’s rule, within a given sublevel there are as many half-filled 
orbitals as possible. Electrons in such orbitals are said to be unpaired. There is one 
unpaired electron in atoms of B and F, two unpaired electrons in C and O atoms, and 
three unpaired electrons in the N atom. When there are two or more unpaired elec-
trons, as in C, N, and O, those electrons have parallel spins.
Hund’s rule, like the Pauli exclusion principle, is based on experiment. It is possible 
to determine the number of unpaired electrons in an atom. With solids, this is done by 
studying their behavior in a magnetic field. If there are unpaired electrons present, the 
solid will be attracted into the field. Such a substance is said to be paramagnetic. If the 
atoms in the solid contain only paired electrons, it is slightly repelled by the field. Sub-
stances of this type are called diamagnetic. With gaseous atoms, the atomic spectrum can 
also be used to establish the presence and number of unpaired electrons.
Hund was still lecturing, colorfully and 
coherently, in his nineties.

The discussion so far in this chapter has focused on electron configurations and orbital 
diagrams of neutral atoms. It is also possible to assign electronic structures to  
monatomic ions, formed from atoms by gaining or losing electrons. In general, when a 
monatomic ion is formed from an atom, electrons are added to or removed from sublevels 
in the highest principal energy level.

6.7  electron arrangements in monatomic ions
Ions with Noble-Gas Structures
As pointed out in Chapter 2, elements close to a noble gas in the periodic table form ions 
that have the same number of electrons as the noble-gas atom. This means that these ions 
have noble-gas electron configurations. Thus the three ­elements preceding neon (N, O, 
and F) and the three elements following neon (Na, Mg, and Al) all form ions with the 
neon configuration, 1s22s22p6. The three nonmetal atoms achieve this structure by gain-

The species N32, O22, F2, Ne, Na1, Mg21, and Al31 are said to be isoelectronic; that is, 
they have the same electron configuration.
There are a great many monatomic ions that have noble-gas configurations; Figure 
6.13 shows 24 ions of this type. Note, once again, that ions in a given main group have the 
same charge (11 for Group 1, 12 for Group 2, 22 for Group 16, 21 for Group 17). This 
explains, in part, the chemical similarity among elements in the same main group. In 
particular, ionic compounds formed by such elements have similar chemical formulas. 
For example,
•	 halides of the alkali metals have the general formula MX, where M 5 Li, Na, K, . . . 
and X 5 F, Cl, Br, . . . .
•	 halides of the alkaline earth metals have the general formula MX2, where M 5 Mg, 
Ca, Sr, . . . and X 5 F, Cl, Br, . . . .
•	 oxides of the alkaline earth metals have the general formula MO, where M 5 Mg, 
Ca, Sr, . . . .
Transition Metal Cations
The transition metals to the right of the scandium subgroup do not form ions with 
noble-gas configurations. To do so, they would have to lose four or more electrons. The 
energy requirement is too high for that to happen. However, as pointed out in Chapter 
2, these metals do form cations with charges of 11, 12, or 13. Applying the principle 
that, in forming cations, electrons are removed from the sublevel of highest n, you can 
predict correctly that when transition metal atoms form positive ions, the outer 
s electrons are lost first. Consider, for example, the formation of the Mn21 ion from 
the Mn atom:

chapter SIX  Electronic Structure and the Periodic Table
Notice that it is the 4s electrons that are lost rather than the 3d electrons. This is known 
to be the case because the Mn21 ion has been shown to have five unpaired electrons (the 
five 3d electrons). If two 3d electrons had been lost, the Mn21 ion would have had only 
three unpaired electrons.
All the transition metals form cations by a similar process, that is, loss of outer  
s electrons. Only after those electrons are lost are electrons removed from the inner  
d sublevel. Consider, for example, what happens with iron, which, you will recall, forms 
two different cations. First the 4s electrons are lost to give the Fe21 ion:
26Fe(Ar 4s23d6) 9: 26Fe21(Ar 3d6) 1 2e2
Then an electron is removed from the 3d level to form the Fe31 ion:
26Fe21(Ar 3d6) 9: 26Fe31(Ar 3d5) 1 e2
In the Fe21 and Fe31 ions, as in all transition metal ions, there are no outer s ­electrons.
You will recall that for fourth period atoms, the 4s sublevel fills before the 3d. In the 
corresponding ions, the electrons come out of the 4s sublevel before the 3d. This is some-
times referred to as the “first in, first out” rule.

6.8 Periodic Trends in the Properties of Atoms
One of the most fundamental principles of chemistry is the periodic law, which states that
The chemical and physical properties of elements are a periodic function of atomic 
number.
This is, of course, the principle behind the structure of the periodic table. Elements within 
a given vertical group resemble one another chemically because chemical properties re-
peat themselves at regular intervals of 2, 8, 18, or 32 ­elements.
In this section we will consider how the periodic table can be used to correlate prop-
erties on an atomic scale. In particular, we will see how atomic radius, ionic radius, ion-
ization energy, and electronegativity vary horizontally and vertically in the periodic 
table.
Atomic Radius
Strictly speaking, the “size” of an atom is a rather nebulous concept. The electron cloud 
surrounding the nucleus does not have a sharp boundary. However, a quantity called the 
atomic radius can be defined and measured, assuming a spherical atom. Ordinarily, the 
atomic radius is taken to be one half the distance of closest approach between atoms in 
an elemental substance (Figure 6.14).
The atomic radii of the main-group elements are shown at the top of Figure 6.15 
(page 180). Notice that, in general, atomic radii
•	 decrease across a period from left to right in the periodic table.
•	 increase down a group in the periodic table.
It is possible to explain these trends in terms of the electron configurations of the 
corresponding atoms. Consider first the increase in radius observed as we move down 
the table, let us say among the alkali metals (Group 1). All these ­elements have a single 
s electron outside a filled level or filled p sublevel. Electrons in these inner levels are 
much closer to the nucleus than the outer s electron and hence effectively shield it from 
the positive charge of the nucleus. To a first ­approximation, each inner electron cancels 
the charge of one proton in the ­nucleus, so the outer s electron is attracted by a net posi-
tive charge of 11. In this sense, it has the properties of an electron in the hydrogen 
solution

atom. Because the average distance of the electron from the hydrogen nucleus increases 
with the principal quantum number, n, the radius increases moving from Li (2s elec-
tron) to Na (3s electron) and so on down the group.
The decrease in atomic radius moving across the periodic table can be ­explained in 
a similar manner. Consider, for example, the third period, where ­electrons are being 
added to the third principal energy level. The added electrons should be relatively poor 
shields for each other because they are all at about the same distance from the nucleus. 
Only the ten core electrons in inner, filled levels (n 5 1, n 5 2) are expected to shield the 
outer electrons from the nucleus. This means that the charge felt by an outer electron, 
called the effective nuclear charge, should increase steadily with atomic number as we 
move across the period. As ­effective nuclear charge increases, the outermost electrons 
are pulled in more tightly, and atomic radius decreases.
Ionic Radius
The radii of cations and anions derived from atoms of the main-group elements are 
shown at the bottom of Figure 6.15 (page 180). The trends referred to previously for 
atomic radii are clearly visible with ionic radius as well. Notice, for example, that ionic 
radius increases moving down a group in the periodic table. Moreover, the radii of both 
cations (left) and anions (right) decrease from left to right across a period.
Comparing the radii of cations and anions with those of the atoms from which they 
are derived
•	 positive ions are smaller than the metal atoms from which they are formed. The 
Na1 ion has a radius, 0.095 nm, only a little more than half that of the Na atom, 
0.186 nm.
•	 negative ions are larger than the nonmetal atoms from which they are formed. The 
radius of the Cl2 ion, 0.181 nm, is nearly twice that of the Cl atom, 0.099 nm.
As a result of these effects, anions in general are larger than cations. Compare, for 
example, the Cl2 ion (radius 5 0.181 nm) with the Na1 ion (radius 5 0.095 nm). This 
means that in sodium chloride, and indeed in the vast majority of all ionic compounds, 
most of the space in the crystal lattice is taken up by anions.
The differences in radii between atoms and ions can be explained quite simply. A 
cation is smaller than the corresponding metal atom because the excess of ­protons in the 
ion draws the outer electrons in closer to the nucleus. In contrast, an extra electron in an 
anion adds to the repulsion between outer electrons, making a negative ion larger than 
the corresponding nonmetal atom.

Ionization Energy
Ionization energy is a measure of how difficult it is to remove an electron from a gas-
eous atom. Energy must always be absorbed to bring about ionization, so ­ionization en-
ergies are always positive quantities.
The (first) ionization energy is the energy change for the removal of the ­outermost 
electron from a gaseous atom to form a 11 ion:
M(g) 9: M1(g) 1 e2    DE1 5 first ionization energy
The more difficult it is to remove electrons, the larger the ionization energy.
Ionization energies of the main-group elements are listed in Figure 6.17. ­Notice that 
ionization energy
•	 increases across the periodic table from left to right.
•	 decreases moving down the periodic table.
Comparing Figures 6.15 (page 180) and 6.17 shows an inverse correlation between 
­ionization energy and atomic radius. The smaller the atom, the more tightly its electrons 
are held to the positively charged nucleus and the more difficult they are to remove. 
Conversely, in a large atom such as that of a Group 1 metal, the ­electron is relatively far 
from the nucleus, so less energy has to be supplied to ­remove it from the atom.

6.8  periodic trends in the properties of atoms
If you look carefully at Figure 6.17 (page 182), you will note a few exceptions to the 
general trends referred to above and illustrated in Example 6.11. For example, the ioniza-
tion energy of B (801 kJ/mol) is less than that of Be (900 kJ/mol). This happens because 
the electron removed from the boron atom comes from the 2p as opposed to the 2s sub-
level for beryllium. Because 2p is higher in energy than 2s, it is not too ­surprising that 
less energy is required to remove an electron from that sublevel.
Electronegativity
The ionization energy of an atom is a measure of its tendency to lose electrons; the larger 
the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove an electron. There are several dif-
ferent ways of comparing the tendencies of different atoms to gain electrons. The most 
useful of these for our purposes is the electronegativity, which measures the ability of an 
atom to attract to itself the electron pair forming a covalent bond.
The greater the electronegativity of an atom, the greater its attraction for ­electrons. 
Table 6.6 shows a scale of electronegativities first proposed by Linus Pauling (1901–1994). 
Each element is assigned a number, ranging from 4.0 for the most ­electronegative ele-
ment, fluorine, to 0.8 for cesium, the least electronegative. Among the main-group ele-
ments, electronegativity increases moving from left to right in the periodic table. Ordi-
narily, it decreases, moving down a group. You will find Table 6.6 very helpful when we 
discuss covalent bonding in Chapter 7.

Consider the three elements C, N, and Si. Using only the ­periodic table, predict which of the three elements has

both silicon and nitrogen to carbon.

Why Do Lobsters Turn Red When Cooked?
Harry A. Frank, University of Connecticut
many biological organisms exhibit visible coloration. This occurs 
when specifi c molecules become bound in proteins or membranes 
of an organism and absorb light in the visible region of the electro-
magnetic spectrum. As described in this  chapter, absorption occurs 
when an atom or molecule is excited by light from the ground elec-
tronic state to a higher excited state. Wavelengths of light not ab-
sorbed are either scattered or refl ected. This may result in color-
ation or patterns that either blend with the environment or stand 
out from it. Why animal species select specifi c  molecules for color-
ation has much to do with the pressures of survival in the wild. 
However, not all animals are able to synthesize what they need for 
this purpose. In many cases, dietary intake plays a role.
Animals ingest plant material in the course of their 
normal dietary intake, and the plant pigments then 
fi nd their way into the outer covering of the organism, 
where they may be exhibited as coloration. many 
complex biochemical and metabolic pathways are in-
volved after ingestion in modifying and transporting 
the molecules that ultimately become pigments.
An excellent case in point is the coloration of the 
American lobster, Homarus americanus. The pigment 
associated with the typical greenish-brown outer 
CHemISTrY beYONd the claSSrOOM
layer of the lobster shell is the carotenoid, astaxanthin (Figure A), an 
oxygenated derivative of  -carotene, also known as the molecule 
that imparts the orange color to carrots.
Both astaxanthin and -carotene belong to a class of pigments 
known as carotenoids. Carotenoids are not synthesized by any 
member of the animal kingdom, but are taken in through the diet. 
The lobster diet consists primarily of fi sh, mollusks, and other crus-
taceans. Therefore, the color of a live lobster can vary due to diff er-
ences in available food sources and environmental conditions. This 
is why some lobsters may be orange, speckled, or even bright blue. 
Indeed, blue coloration is frequently  observed in the joints of a live 
lobster’s appendages (Figure B, page 185). When cooked, the color 
of the lobster turns red. How does this happen?
After being ingested, astaxanthin molecules are assembled in a 
large protein called crustacyanin and then bound in the calcifi ed outer

ecule where the "o and !oH groups are replaced with  hydrogens.

layer of the lobster shell. When an astaxanthin molecule is bound in 
the crustacyanin protein, its structure ­becomes twisted and pairs up 
with another astaxanthin. This combination of twisting and pairing of 
astaxanthin molecules produces a pigment-protein complex that 
­absorbs the long wavelengths of visible light (Figure C) and hence 
appears blue. Free astaxanthin dissolved in organic solvents, such as 
methanol, absorbs the shorter ­wavelengths of blue-green light (Figure 
C)  and therefore appears the complement of this color, which is red.
Because the lobster accumulates a combination of protein-bound 
(blue) and free (red) astaxanthin in its shell, the live animal appears 
greenish-brown, which ­apparently serves it well as a disguise against 
predators 
on 
the 
ocean floor. The color 
change upon cooking 
occurs because high 
temperatures dena-
ture the crustacyanin 
protein and release the bound astaxanthin. No longer constrained by 
the protein, but still intact, astaxanthin imparts the same red color to 
the shell that it exhibits as a free molecule in organic solvent. Our 
world is colored by an abundance of these carotenoid pigments in 
mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, and other living creatures.

arlier we referred to the forces that hold nonmetal atoms to one another, covalent 
bonds. These bonds consist of an electron pair shared between two atoms. To repre-
sent the covalent bond in the H2 molecule, two structures can be written:
H;H    or    H ! H
These structures can be misleading if they are taken to mean that the two electrons are 
fixed in position between the two nuclei. A more accurate picture of the electron density in 
H2 is shown in Figure 7.1 (page 191). At a given instant, the two electrons may be located at 
any of various points about the two nuclei. However, they are more likely to be found be-
tween the nuclei than at the far ends of the molecule.
To understand the stability of the electron-pair bond, consider the graph shown in 
Figure 7.2 (page 191), where we plot the energy of interaction between two hydrogen at-
oms as a function of distance. At large distances of separation (far right) the system con-
sists of two isolated H atoms that do not interact with each other. As the atoms come 
closer together (moving to the left in Figure 7.2), they experience an attraction that leads 
gradually to an energy minimum. At an internuclear distance of 0.074 nm and an attractive 
energy of 436 kJ, the system is in its most stable state; we refer to that state as the

H2 molecule. If the atoms are brought closer together, forces of repulsion become increas-
ingly important and the energy curve rises steeply.
The existence of the energy minimum shown in Figure 7.2 is directly responsible for the 
stability of the H2 molecule. The attractive forces that bring about this minimum result from 
two factors:
1. Locating two electrons between the two protons of the H2 molecule lowers the 
electrostatic energy of the system. Attractive energies between oppositely charged parti-
cles (electron-proton) slightly exceed the repulsive energies between particles of like charge 
(electron-electron, proton-proton).
2. When two hydrogen atoms come together to form a molecule, the electrons are 
spread over the entire volume of the molecule instead of being confined to a particular 
atom. As pointed out in Chapter 6, quantum mechanics tells us that increasing the volume 
available to an electron decreases its kinetic energy. We often describe this situation by say-
ing that the two 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atom “overlap” to form a new bonding orbital. At 
any rate, calculations suggest that this is the principal factor accounting for the stability of 
the H2 molecule.
This chapter is devoted to the covalent bond as it exists in molecules and polyatomic 
ions. We consider
• the distribution of outer level (valence) electrons in species in which atoms are joined 
by covalent bonds. These distributions are most simply described by Lewis structures 
(Section 7.1).
• molecular geometries. The so-called VSEPR model can be used to predict the angles 
between covalent bonds formed by a central atom (Section 7.2).
• the polarity of covalent bonds and the molecules they form (Section 7.3). Most bonds 
and many molecules are polar in the sense that they have a positive and a negative pole.
• the distribution of valence electrons among atomic orbitals, using the valence bond 
approach (Section 7.4). 
7.1 Lewis Structures; The Octet Rule
The idea of the covalent bond was first suggested by the American physical chemist Gil-
bert Newton Lewis (1875–1946) in 1916. He pointed out that the electron configuration 
of the noble gases appears to be a particularly stable one. Noble-gas atoms are themselves 
extremely unreactive. Moreover, as pointed out in Chapter 6, a great many monatomic 
ions have noble-gas structures. Lewis suggested that nonmetal atoms, by sharing elec-
trons to form an electron-pair bond, can acquire a stable noble-gas structure. Consider,

chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
for example, two hydrogen atoms, each with one electron. The process by which they 
combine to form an H2 molecule can be shown as
H + H
H

using dots to represent electrons; the circles emphasize that the pair of electrons in the 
covalent bond can be considered to occupy the 1s orbital of either hydrogen atom. In that 
sense, each atom in the H2 molecule has the electronic structure of the noble gas helium, 
with the electron configuration 1s2.
This idea is readily extended to simple molecules of compounds formed by non-
metal atoms. An example is the HF molecule. You will recall that a fluorine atom has the 
electron configuration 1s22s22p5. It has seven electrons in its outermost principal energy 
level (n 5 2). These are referred to as valence electrons, in contrast to the core electrons 
filling the principal level, n 5 1. If the valence electrons are shown as dots around the 
symbol of the element, the fluorine atom can be represented as
F
The combination of a hydrogen with a fluorine atom leads to
F
F
H +
H
As you can see, the fluorine atom “owns” six valence electrons outright and shares 
two others. Putting it another way, the F atom is surrounded by eight valence electrons; 
its electron configuration has become 1s22s22p6, which is that of the noble gas neon. This, 
according to Lewis, explains why the HF molecule is stable in contrast to species such as 
H2F, H3F, . . . none of which exist.
These structures (without the circles) are referred to as Lewis structures. In writing 
Lewis structures, only the valence electrons written above are shown, because they are 
the ones that participate in covalent bonding. For the main-group elements, the only 
ones dealt with here, the number of valence electrons is equal to the last digit of the 
group number in the periodic table (Table 7.1). Notice that elements in a given main 
group all have the same number of valence electrons. This explains why such elements 
behave similarly when they react to form covalently bonded species.
In the Lewis structure of a molecule or polyatomic ion, valence electrons ordinarily 
occur in pairs. There are two kinds of electron pairs.
	 1.	 A pair of electrons shared between two atoms is a covalent bond, ordinarily shown 
as a straight line between bonded atoms.
	 2.	 An unshared pair of electrons, owned entirely by one atom, is shown as a pair of 
dots on that atom. (An unshared pair is often referred to, more picturesquely, as a 
lone pair.)
Valence electrons are the ones 
involved in bonding.

Notice that in each case the oxygen or nitrogen atom is surrounded by eight valence electrons. 
In each species, a single electron pair is shared between two bonded atoms. These bonds are 
called single bonds. There is one single bond in the OH2 ion, two in the H2O molecule, three 
in NH3, and four in NH41. There are three unshared pairs in the hydroxide ion, two in the 
water molecule, one in the ammonia molecule, and none in the ammonium ion.
Bonded atoms can share more than one electron pair. A double bond occurs when 
bonded atoms share two electron pairs; in a triple bond, three pairs of electrons are 
shared. In ethylene (C2H4) and acetylene (C2H2), the carbon atoms are linked by a dou-
ble bond and triple bond, respectively. Using two parallel lines to represent a double 
bond and three for a triple bond, we write the structures of these molecules as
C"C

Note that each carbon is surrounded by eight valence electrons and each hydrogen by two.
These examples illustrate the principle that atoms in covalently bonded species tend 
to have noble-gas electronic structures. This generalization is often referred to as the 
octet rule. Nonmetals, except for hydrogen, achieve a noble-gas structure by sharing in 
an octet of electrons (eight). Hydrogen atoms, in molecules or polyatomic ions, are sur-
rounded by a duet of electrons (two).
Writing Lewis Structures
For very simple species, Lewis structures can often be written by inspection. Usually, 
though, you will save time by following these steps:
	 1.	 Draw a skeleton of the species joining atoms by single bonds 
  Most of the species appearing in this chapter consist of a central atom bonded to two or 
more terminal atoms. 
  — The central atom is usually written first in the formula. 
  — The terminal atoms are most often hydrogen, oxygen, and the halogens. 
 2. Count the number of valence electrons (VE). 
  — For a molecule, add the number of valence electrons of all the atoms present. 
  — For a polyatomic anion, add the number of valence electrons of each atom plus one 
electron for each unit of negative charge (e.g., for SO422, add 2 electrons) 
  — For a polyatomic cation, add the number of valence electrons of each atom and 
subtract one electron for each unit of positive charge (e.g., for NH41, subtract 
1 electron) 
 3. Count the number of valence electrons available for distribution (AE). 
  AE 5 VE 2 2(number of bonds in the skeleton) 
 4. Count the number of electrons required to fill out an octet for each atom (except H) in 
the skeleton (NE). 
  Remember that shared atoms are counted for both atoms. 
  (a) If AE 5 NE, your skeleton is correct. Distribute the available electrons as unshared 
pairs satisfying the octet rule. 
  (b) If AE < NE, modify your skeleton by changing single bonds to double or triple 
bonds. 
— 2 electrons short: convert one single bond to a double bond. 
— 4 electrons short: convert one single bond to a triple bond, or two single bonds 
to double bonds. 
	 	 Hydrogen and the halogens never form double bonds. 
Figure 7.3 shows how to follow these steps for SO2.

7.1  lewis structures; the octet rule
Resonance Forms
In certain cases, the Lewis structure does not adequately describe the properties of the 
ion or molecule that it represents. Consider, for example, the SO2 structure in Figure 7.3 
(page 193). This structure implies that there are two different kinds of sulfur-to-oxygen 
bonds in SO2. One of these appears to be a single bond, the other a double bond. Yet 
experiment shows that there is only one kind of bond in the molecule.
One way to explain this situation is to assume that each of the bonds in SO2 is inter-
mediate between a single and a double bond. To express this concept, two structures, 
separated by a double-headed arrow, are written
S
O
O
S
O
O
with the understanding that the true structure is intermediate between them. These are 
referred to as resonance forms. The actual structure is intermediate between the two reso-
nance forms and is called a resonance hybrid. It is the only structure that actually exists 
(Figure 7.4, page 196). The individual resonance forms do not exist and are merely a con-
venient way to describe the real structures. The concept of resonance is invoked whenever 
a single Lewis structure does not adequately reflect the properties of a substance.
Another species for which it is necessary to invoke the idea of resonance is the ni-
trate ion. Here three equivalent structures can be written to explain the experimental 
observation that the three nitrogen-to-oxygen bonds in the NO32 ion are identical in all 
respects.

These structures are commonly abbreviated as

hydrogen atom.
We will encounter other examples of molecules and ions whose properties can be 
interpreted in terms of resonance. In all such species:
1.  Resonance forms do not imply different kinds of molecules with electrons shifting 
eternally between them. There is only one type of SO2 molecule; its structure is intermediate 
between those of the two resonance forms drawn for sulfur dioxide.
2.  Resonance can be anticipated when it is possible to write two or more Lewis struc-
tures that are about equally plausible. In the case of the nitrate ion, the three structures we 
have written are equivalent. One could, in principle, write many other structures, but none 
of them would put eight electrons around each atom.
3.  Resonance forms differ only in the distribution of electrons, not in the arrangement 
of atoms. The molecule

7.1  lewis structures; the octet rule
Formal Charge
Often it is possible to write two different Lewis structures for a molecule differing in the 
arrangement of atoms, that is,
A ! A ! B        or        A ! B ! A
Sometimes both structures represent real compounds that are isomers of each other. 
More often, only one structure exists in nature. For example, methyl alcohol (CH4O) has 
the structure
H9C9O9H
H
H
In contrast, the structure
H9C9O9H
H
H
does not correspond to any real compound even though it obeys the octet rule.
There are several ways to choose the more plausible of two structures differing in 
their arrangement of atoms. As pointed out in Example 7.1, the fact that carbon almost 
always forms four bonds leads to the correct structure for ethane. Another approach 
involves a concept called formal charge, which can be applied to any atom within a 
Lewis structure. The formal charge is the difference between the number of valence 
electrons in the free atom and the number assigned to that atom in the Lewis struc-
ture. The assigned electrons include
•	 all the unshared electrons owned by that atom.
•	 one half of the bonding electrons shared by that atom.
Thus the formal charge can be determined by counting the electrons “owned” by the 
atom, its valence electrons (VE), the unshared pairs around the atom, and the bonding 
electrons around the atom. We arrive at the following equation: 
Cf 5 VE 2 unshared electrons 21

chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
Since a bond is always made up of two electrons, we can find the formal charge by 
using the modified equation below: 
Cf 5 VE 2 unshared electrons 2 number of bonds
To show how this works, let’s calculate the formal charges of carbon and oxygen in 
the two structures written above for methyl alcohol:
H9C9O9H
H

H9C9O9H
H

bonds 5 3 
	
Cf 5 6 2 4 2 2 5 0	
	
Cf 5 6 2 2 2 3 5 11
Ordinarily, the more likely Lewis structure is the one in which
•	 the formal charges are as close to zero as possible.
•	 any negative formal charge is located on the most strongly electronegative atom.
Applying these rules, we can see that structure (1) for methyl alcohol is preferred over 
structure (2). In (1), both carbon and oxygen have formal charges of zero. In (2), a nega-
tive charge is assigned to carbon, which is actually less electronegative than oxygen (2.5 
versus 3.5).
The concept of formal charge has a much wider applicability than this short dis-
cussion might imply. In particular, it can be used to predict situations in which con-
ventional Lewis structures, written in accordance with the octet rule, may be incorrect 
(Table 7.2).
Exceptions to the Octet Rule: Electron-Deficient 
Molecules
Although most of the molecules and polyatomic ions referred to in general chemistry 
follow the octet rule, there are some familiar species that do not. Among these are mol-
ecules containing an odd number of valence electrons. Nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen 
dioxide, NO2, fall in this category:
NO      no. of valence electrons 5 5 1 6 5 11
NO2    no. of valence electrons 5 5 1 6(2) 5 17

7.1  lewis structures; the octet rule
For such odd electron species (sometimes called free radicals) it is impossible to 
write Lewis structures in which each atom obeys the octet rule. In the NO molecule, the 
unpaired electron is put on the nitrogen atom, giving both atoms a formal charge of zero:
 N " O 
In NO2, the best structure one can write again puts the unpaired electron on the nitrogen 
atom:
O

Elementary oxygen, like NO and NO2, is paramagnetic (Figure 7.5). Experimental 
evidence suggests that the O2 molecule contains two unpaired electrons and a double 
bond. It is impossible to write a conventional Lewis structure for O2 that has these two 
characteristics. A more sophisticated model of bonding, using molecular orbitals (Ap-
pendix 4), is required to explain the properties of oxygen.
There are a few species in which the central atom violates the octet rule in the sense 
that it is surrounded by two or three electron pairs rather than four. Examples include 
the fluorides of beryllium and boron, BeF2 and BF3. Although one could write multiple 
bonded structures for these molecules in accordance with the octet rule (Table 7.2), ex-
perimental evidence suggests the structures

in which the central atom is surrounded by four and six valence electrons, respectively,

fungicide.

Born in massachusetts, G. N. lewis grew up 
in Nebraska, then came back east to obtain 
his B.S. (1896) and ph.D. (1899) at Harvard. 
Although he stayed on for a few years as an 
instructor, lewis seems never to have been 
happy at Harvard. A precocious student and 
an intellectual rebel, he was repelled by the 
highly traditional atmosphere that prevailed 
in the chemistry department there in his 
time. many years later, he refused an honor-
ary degree from his alma mater.
After leaving Harvard, lewis made his 
reputation at miT, where he was promoted 
to full professor in only four years. in 1912, 
he moved across the country to the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley, as dean of the 
College of Chemistry and department 
head. He remained there for the rest of his 
life. Under his guidance, the chemistry de-
partment at Berkeley became perhaps the 
most prestigious in the country. Among the 
faculty and graduate students that he at-
tracted were fi ve future Nobel prize 
winners: Harold Urey in 1934, William 
Giauque in 1949, Glenn Seaborg in 1951, 
Willard libby in 1960, and melvin Calvin in 
1961.
in administering the chemistry depart-
ment at Berkeley, lewis demanded excel-
lence in both research and teaching. Virtu-
ally the entire staff  was involved in the 
general chemistry program; at one time 
eight full professors carried freshman 
sections.
lewis’s interest in chemical bonding 
and structure dated from 1902. in attempt-
ing to explain “valence” to a class at 
Harvard, he devised an atomic model to ra-
tionalize the octet rule. His model was defi -
cient in many respects; for one thing, lewis 
visualized cubic atoms with electrons 
located at the corners. perhaps this ex-
plains why his ideas of atomic structure 
were not published until 1916. in that year, 
lewis conceived of the electron-pair bond, 
perhaps his greatest single contribution to 
chemistry. At that time, it was widely be-
lieved that all bonds were ionic; lewis’s 
ideas were rejected by many well-known 
organic chemists.
in 1923, lewis published a classic book 
(later reprinted by Dover publications) 
titled Valence and the Structure of Atoms 
and Molecules. Here, in lewis’s characteris-
tically lucid style, we fi nd many of the basic 
principles of covalent bonding discussed in 
this chapter. included are electron-dot 
structures, the octet rule, and the concept 
of electronegativity. Here too is the lewis 
defi nition of acids and bases (Chapter 13). 
That same year, lewis published with 
merle Randall a text called Thermodynam-
ics and the Free Energy of Chemical Sub-
stances. Today, a revised edition of that 
text is still used in graduate courses in 
chemistry.
The years from 1923 to 1938 were rela-
tively unproductive for G. N. lewis insofar 
as his own research was concerned. The 
applications of the electron-pair bond 
came largely in the areas of organic and 
quantum chemistry; in neither of these 
fi elds did lewis feel at home. in the early 
1930s, he published a series of relatively 
minor papers dealing with the properties of 
deuterium. Then in 1939 he began to 
publish in the fi eld of photochemistry. Of 
approximately 20 papers in this area, 
several were of fundamental importance, 
comparable in quality to the best work of 
his early years. Retired offi  cially in 1945,

All these atoms have d orbitals available for bonding (3d, 4d, 5d). Th ese are the orbitals 
in which the extra pairs of electrons are located in such species as PCl5 and SF6. Because 
there is no 2d sublevel, C, N, and O never form expanded octets.
Sometimes, as with PCl5 and SF6, it is clear from the formula that the central atom 
has an expanded octet. Oft en, however, it is by no means obvious that this is the case. At 
fi rst glance, formulas such as ClF3 or XeF4 look completely straightforward. However, 
when you try to draw the Lewis structure it becomes clear that an expanded octet is in-
volved. Th e number of electrons available aft er the skeleton is drawn is greater than the 
number required to give each atom an octet. When that happens, distribute the extra 
electrons (two or four) around the central atom as unshared pairs.
Th e presence of expanded octets requires modifi cation of the process we delineated 
in Figure 7.3 (page 193). Below is a modifi cation that includes the possibility of an ex-
panded octet (Figure 7.6, page 202). We use ClF3 as an example.

7.2 Molecular Geometry
The geometry of a diatomic molecule such as Cl2 or HCl can be described very simply. 
Because two points define a straight line, the molecule must be linear.
Cl ! Cl        H ! Cl
With molecules containing three or more atoms, the geometry is not so obvious. 
Here, the angles between bonds, called bond angles, must be considered. For example, 
a molecule of the type YX2, where Y represents the central atom and X an atom bonded 
to it, can be
•	 linear, with a bond angle of 1808:        X ! Y ! X
•	 bent, with a bond angle less than 1808:

The major features of molecular geometry can be predicted on the basis of a quite 
simple principle—electron-pair repulsion. This principle is the essence of the valence-
shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model, first suggested by N. V. Sidgwick (1873–1952) 
and H. M. Powell (1906–1991) in 1940. It was developed and expanded later by R. J. Gil-
lespie (1924–) and R. S. Nyholm (1917–1971). According to the VSEPR model, the va-
lence electron pairs surrounding an atom repel one another. Consequently, the orbitals 
containing those electron pairs are oriented to be as far apart as possible.
In this section we apply this model to predict the geometry of some rather simple 
molecules and polyatomic ions. In all these species, a central atom is surrounded by 
from two to six pairs of electrons.
Ideal Geometries with Two to Six Electron  
Pairs on the Central Atom
We begin by considering species in which a central atom, A, is surrounded by from two 
to six electron pairs, all of which are used to form single bonds with terminal atoms, X. 
These species have the general formulas AX2, AX3, . . . , AX6. It is understood that there 
are no unshared pairs around atom A.
To see how the bonding orbitals surrounding the central atom are oriented with 
respect to one another, consider Figure 7.7, which shows the positions taken naturally by 
two to six balloons tied together at the center. The balloons, like the orbitals they repre-
sent, arrange themselves to be as far from one another as possible.
Figure 7.8 (page 203) shows the geometries predicted by the VSEPR model for molecules 
of the types AX2 to AX6. The geometries for two and three electron pairs are those associated 
with species in which the central atom has less than an octet of electrons. Molecules of this type 
include BeF2 (in the gas state) and BF3, which have the Lewis structures shown below:

7.2  molecular geometry
Two electron pairs are as far apart as possible when they are directed at 1808 to one an-
other. This gives BeF2 a linear structure. The three electron pairs around the boron atom 
in BF3 are directed toward the corners of an equilateral triangle; the bond angles are 1208. 
We describe this geometry as trigonal planar.
In species that follow the octet rule, the central atom is surrounded by four electron 
pairs. If each of these pairs forms a single bond with a terminal atom, a molecule of the 
type AX4 results. The four bonds are directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahe-
dron. All the bond angles are 109.58, the tetrahedral angle. This geometry is found in 
many polyatomic ions such as NH41 and SO422 and in a wide variety of organic mole-
cules, the simplest of which is methane, CH4.
Molecules of the type AX5 and AX6 require the central atom to have an expanded oc-
tet. The geometries of these molecules are shown at the bottom of Figure 7.8. In PF5, the 
five bonding pairs are directed toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid, a figure formed 
when two triangular pyramids are fused together, base to base. Three of the fluorine atoms 
are located at the corners of an equilateral triangle with the phosphorus atom at the center; 
the other two fluorine atoms are directly above and below the P atom. In SF6, the six bonds

are directed toward the corners of a regular octahedron, a figure with eight sides but six 
vertices. An octahedron can be formed by fusing two square pyramids base to base. Four 
of the fluorine atoms in SF6 are located at the corners of a square with the S atom at the 
center; one fluorine atom is directly above the S atom, another directly below it.
Effect of Unshared Pairs on Molecular Geometry
In many molecules and polyatomic ions, one or more of the electron pairs around the 
central atom are unshared. The VSEPR model is readily extended to predict the geome-
tries of these species. In general
 1. The electron-pair geometry is approximately the same as that observed when only single 
bonds are involved. The bond angles are ordinarily a little smaller than the ideal values 
listed in Figure 7.8.
	 2.	 The molecular geometry is quite different when one or more unshared pairs are present. 
In describing molecular geometry, we refer only to the positions of the bonded atoms. 
These positions can be determined experimentally; positions of unshared pairs cannot 
be established by experiment. Hence, the locations of unshared pairs are not specified in 
describing molecular geometry.
With these principles in mind, consider the NH3 molecule:
N
H
H
H
The apparent orientation of the four electron pairs around the N atom in NH3 is shown 
at the left of Figure 7.9. Notice that, as in CH4, the four pairs are directed toward the 
corners of a regular tetrahedron. The diagram at the right of Figure 7.9 shows the posi-
tions of the atoms in NH3. The nitrogen atom is located above the center of an equilateral 
triangle formed by the three hydrogen atoms. The molecular geometry of the NH3 mol-
ecule is described as a trigonal pyramid. The nitrogen atom is at the apex of the pyra-
mid, and the three hydrogen atoms form its triangular base. The molecule is three- 
dimensional, as the word “pyramid” implies.
The development we have just gone through for NH3 is readily extended to the wa-
ter molecule, H2O. Here the Lewis structure shows that the central oxygen atom is sur-
rounded by two single bonds and two unshared pairs:
O
H
H
The diagram at the left of Figure 7.10 emphasizes that the four electron pairs are oriented 
tetrahedrally. At the right, the positions of the atoms are shown. Clearly they are not in a 
straight line; the H2O molecule is bent.

ing at the right, H2O is a bent molecule. 
The bond angle, 1058, is a little smaller 
than the tetrahedral angle, 109.58. 
The unshared pairs spread out over a 
larger volume than that occupied by the 
bonding pairs.

205
 
7.2  molecular geometry
Experiments show that the bond angles in NH3 and H2O are slightly less than the 
ideal value of 109.58. In NH3 (three single bonds, one unshared pair around N), 
the bond angle is 1078. In H2O (two single bonds, two unshared pairs around O), the 
bond angle is about 1058.
These effects can be explained in a rather simple way. An unshared pair is attracted 
by one nucleus, that of the atom to which it belongs. In contrast, a bonding pair is at-
tracted by two nuclei, those of the two atoms it joins. Hence the electron cloud of an 
unshared pair is expected to spread out over a larger volume than that of a bonding pair. 
In NH3, this tends to force the bonding pairs closer to one another, thereby reducing the 
bond angle. Where there are two unshared pairs, as in H2O, this effect is more pro-
nounced. In general, the VSEPR model predicts that unshared electron pairs will occupy 
slightly more space than bonding pairs.
Table 7.3 summarizes the molecular geometries of species in which a central atom 
is surrounded by two, three, or four electron pairs. The table is organized in terms of the 
number of terminal atoms, X, and unshared pairs, E, surrounding the central atom, A.
Unshared pairs reduce bond angles 
below ideal values.

chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
In many expanded-octet molecules, one or more of the electron pairs around the 
central atom are unshared. Recall, for example, the Lewis structure of xenon tetrafluo-
ride, XeF4 (Example 7.4).
Xe
F
F
F
F
There are six electron pairs around the xenon atom; four of these are covalent bonds to 
fluorine and the other two pairs are unshared. This molecule is classified as AX4E2.
Geometries of molecules such as these can be predicted by the VSEPR model. The 
results are shown in Figure 7.11 (page 207). The structures listed include those of all types 
of molecules having five or six electron pairs around the central atom, one or more of 
which may be unshared. Note that
•	 in molecules of the type AX4E2, the two lone pairs occupy opposite rather than adja-
cent vertices of the octahedron.
•	 in the molecules AX4E, AX3E2, and AX2E3 the lone pairs occupy successive positions 
in the equilateral triangle at the center of the trigonal bipyramid.
Multiple Bonds
The VSEPR model is readily extended to species in which double or triple bonds are 
present. A simple principle applies: Insofar as molecular geometry is concerned, a mul-
tiple bond behaves like a single bond. This makes sense. The four electrons in a double 
bond, or the six electrons in a triple bond, must be located between the two atoms, as are 
the two electrons in a single bond. This means that the electron pairs in a multiple bond 
must occupy the same region of space as those in a single bond. Hence the “extra” elec-
tron pairs in a multiple bond have no effect on geometry.
To illustrate this principle, consider the CO2 molecule. Its Lewis structure is

chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
The central atom, carbon, has two double bonds and no unshared pairs. For purposes of 
determining molecular geometry, we pretend that the double bonds are single bonds, 
ignoring the extra bonding pairs. The bonds are directed to be as far apart as possible, 
giving a 1808 O ! C ! O bond angle. The CO2 molecule, like BeF2, is linear:

This principle can be restated in a somewhat different way for molecules in which 
there is a single central atom. The geometry of such a molecule depends only on
•	 the number of terminal atoms, X, bonded to the central atom, irrespective of 
whether the bonds are single, double, or triple.
•	 the number of unshared pairs, E, around the central atom.
This means that Table 7.3 can be used in the usual way to predict the geometry of a spe-
cies containing multiple bonds.
CO2, like BeF2, is an AX2 molecule with 
no unshared pairs.

The VSEPR model applies equally well to molecules in which there is no single cen-
tral atom. Consider the acetylene molecule, C2H2. Recall that here the two carbon atoms 
are joined by a triple bond:
H
H
C
C
Each carbon atom behaves as if it were surrounded by two electron pairs. Both of the 
bond angles (H ! C # C and C # C ! H) are 1808. The molecule is linear; the four at-
oms are in a straight line. The two extra electron pairs in the triple bond do not affect the 
geometry of the molecule.

The six atoms are located in a plane with bond angles of approximately 1208. Actually, the

1208, and the H ! C ! H angles are slightly less.

7.3 Polarity of Molecules
Covalent bonds and molecules held together by such bonds may be—
•	 polar. As a result of an unsymmetrical distribution of electrons, the bond or molecule 
contains a positive and a negative pole and is therefore a dipole.
•	 nonpolar. A symmetrical distribution of electrons leads to a bond or molecule with 
no positive or negative poles.
Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
The two electrons in the H2 molecule are shared equally by the two nuclei. Stated another 
way, a bonding electron is as likely to be found in the vicinity of one nucleus as another. 
Bonds of this type are described as nonpolar. Nonpolar bonds are formed whenever the 
two atoms joined are identical, as in H2 and F2.
In the HF molecule, the distribution of the bonding electrons is somewhat different 
from that in H2 or F2. Here the density of the electron cloud is greater about the fluorine 
atom. The bonding electrons, on the average, are shifted toward fluorine and away from 
the hydrogen (atom Y in Figure 7.12). Bonds in which the electron density is unsym-
metrical are referred to as polar bonds.
Atoms of two different elements always differ at least slightly in their electronegativ-
ity (recall Table 6.6). Hence covalent bonds between unlike atoms are always polar. Con-
sider, for example, the H ! F bond. Because fluorine has a higher electronegativity (4.0) 
than does hydrogen (2.2), bonding electrons are displaced toward the fluorine atom. The 
H ! F bond is polar, with a partial negative charge at the fluorine atom and a partial 
positive charge at the hydrogen atom.
The extent of polarity of a covalent bond is related to the difference in electronegativi-
ties of the bonded atoms. If this difference is large, as in H ! F (DEN 5 1.8), the bond is 
strongly polar. Where the difference is small, as in H ! C (DEN 5 0.3), the bond is only 
slightly polar.
Polar and Nonpolar Molecules
A polar molecule is one that contains positive and negative poles. There is a partial posi-
tive charge (positive pole) at one point in the molecule and a partial negative charge (nega-
tive pole) at a different point. As shown in Figure 7.13 (page 210), polar molecules orient 
themselves in the presence of an electric field. The positive pole in the molecule tends to 
align with the external negative charge, and the negative pole with the external positive 
charge. In contrast, there are no positive and negative poles in a nonpolar molecule. In an 
electric field, nonpolar molecules, such as H2, show no preferred orientation.

is more electronegative than atom Y, the 
electron cloud of the bonding electrons

Thus the bond is polar.
All molecules, except those of ele-
ments, have polar bonds..

210
 
chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
The extent to which molecules tend to orient themselves in an electrical field is a 
measure of their dipole moment. A polar molecule such as HF has a dipole moment; a 
nonpolar molecule such as H2 or F2 has a dipole moment of zero.
If a molecule is diatomic, it is easy to decide whether it is polar or nonpolar. A di-
atomic molecule has only one kind of bond; hence the polarity of the molecule is the 
same as the polarity of the bond. Hydrogen and fluorine (H2, F2) are nonpolar because 
the bonded atoms are identical and the bond is nonpolar. Hydrogen fluoride, HF, on the 
other hand, has a polar bond, so the molecule is polar. The bonding electrons spend 
more time near the fluorine atom so that there is a negative pole at that end and a posi-
tive pole at the hydrogen end. This is sometimes indicated by writing
H 9
s: F
The arrow points toward the negative end of the polar bond (F atom); the plus sign is at 
the positive end (H atom). The HF molecule is called a dipole; it contains positive and 
negative poles.
If a molecule contains more than two atoms it is not so easy to decide whether it is 
polar or nonpolar. In this case, not only bond polarity but also molecular geometry de-
termines the polarity of the molecule. To illustrate what is involved, consider the mole-
cules shown in Figure 7.14 (page 211).
1.  In BeF2 there are two polar Be ! F bonds; in both bonds, the electron density is con-
centrated around the more electronegative fluorine atom. However, because the BeF2 mol-
ecule is linear, the two Be 9
s: F dipoles are in opposite directions and cancel one another. 
The molecule has no net dipole and hence is nonpolar. From a slightly different point of 
view, in BeF2 the centers of positive and negative charge coincide with each other at the Be 
atom. There is no way that a BeF2 molecule can line up in an electric field.
2.  Because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen (3.5 versus 2.2) an O ! H bond 
is polar, with the electron density higher around the oxygen atom. In the bent H2O molecule, 
the two H 9
s: O dipoles do not cancel each other. Instead, they add to give the H2O molecule 
a net dipole. The center of negative charge is located at the O atom; this is the negative pole of 
the molecule. The center of positive charge is located midway between the two H atoms; the 
positive pole of the molecule is at that point. The H2O molecule is polar. It tends to line up in 
an electric field with the oxygen atom oriented toward the positive electrode.

7.3  polarity of molecules
3.  Carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, is another molecule that, like BeF2, is nonpolar despite 
the presence of polar bonds. Each of its four bonds is a dipole, C 9
s: Cl. However, because 
the four bonds are arranged symmetrically around the carbon atom, they cancel. As a result, 
the molecule has no net dipole; it is nonpolar. If one of the Cl atoms in CCl4 is replaced by 
hydrogen, the situation changes. In the CHCl3 molecule, the H 9
s: C dipole does not cancel 
with the three C 9
s: Cl dipoles. Hence CHCl3 is polar.
There are two criteria for determining the polarity of a molecule: bond polarity and 
molecular geometry. If the polar A ! X bonds in a molecule AXmEn are arranged sym-
metrically around the central atom A, the molecule is nonpolar.

Generalizing from Example 7.7 and the preceding discussion, we can establish the 
following rules
•	 Molecules of the type AX2 (linear), AX3 (trigonal planar), and AX4 (tetrahedral) are 
nonpolar if the terminal atoms are identical. Examples: CO2, BF3, and CCl4 are non-
polar; CHCl3 is polar.
•	 Molecules of the type AX2E (bent), AX2E2 (bent), and AX3E (trigonal pyramid) are 
polar. Examples: SO2, H2O, NH3

7.4 Atomic Orbitals; Hybridization
In the 1930s a theoretical treatment of the covalent bond was developed by, among oth-
ers, Linus Pauling (1901–1994), then at the California Institute of Technology. The atomic 
orbital or valence bond model won him the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1954. Eight years 
later, Pauling won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to stop nuclear testing.
According to this model, a covalent bond consists of a pair of electrons of opposed spin 
within an orbital. For example, a hydrogen atom forms a covalent bond by accepting an elec-
tron from another atom to complete its 1s orbital. Using orbital diagrams, we could write

The second electron, shown in blue, is contributed by another atom. This could be an-
other H atom in H2, an F atom in HF, a C atom in CH4, and so on.

chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
This simple model is readily extended to other atoms. The fluorine atom (electron 
configuration 1s22s22p5) has a half-filled p orbital:
	
1s	
2s	
2p
isolated F atom    (qp)    (qp)    (qp)(qp)(q   )
By accepting an electron from another atom, F can complete this 2p orbital:
	
1s	
2s	
2p
F atom in HF, F2,  . .    (qp)    (qp)    (qp)(qp)(qp)
According to this model, it would seem that for an atom to form a covalent bond, it 
must have an unpaired electron. Indeed, the number of bonds formed by an atom should 
be determined by its number of unpaired electrons. Because hydrogen has an unpaired 
electron, an H atom should form one covalent bond, as indeed it does. The same holds 
for the F atom, which forms only one bond. The noble-gas atoms He and Ne, which have 
no unpaired electrons, should not form bonds at all; they don’t.
When this simple idea is extended beyond hydrogen, the halogens, and the noble 
gases, problems arise. Consider, for example, the three atoms Be (Z 5 4), B (Z 5 5), and C 
(Z 5 6):
	
1s	
2s	
2p

B atom	
(qp)    (qp)    (q)(  )(  )
	
C atom	
(qp)    (qp)    (q)(q)(  )
Notice that the beryllium atom has no unpaired electrons, the boron atom has one, and 
the carbon atom two. Simple valence bond theory would predict that Be, like He, should 
not form covalent bonds. A boron atom should form one bond, carbon two. Experience 
tells us that these predictions are wrong. Beryllium forms two bonds in BeF2; boron 
forms three bonds in BF3. Carbon ordinarily forms four bonds, not two.
To explain these and other discrepancies, simple valence bond theory must be mod-
ified. It is necessary to invoke a new kind of orbital, called a hybrid orbital.
Hybrid Orbitals: sp, sp2, sp3, sp3d, sp3d2
The formation of the BeF2 molecule can be explained by assuming that, as two fluorine 
atoms approach Be, the atomic orbitals of the beryllium atom undergo a significant 
change. Specifically, the 2s orbital is mixed or hybridized with a 2p orbital to form two 
new sp hybrid orbi­tals (Figure 7.15).
one s atomic orbital 1 one p atomic orbital 9: two sp hybrid orbitals
In the BeF2 molecule, there are two electron-pair bonds. These electron pairs are 
located in the two sp hybrid orbitals. In each orbital, one electron is a valence electron 
contributed by beryllium; the other electron comes from the fluorine atom.
A similar argument can be used to explain why boron forms three bonds and car-
bon forms four. In the case of boron:
one s atomic orbital 1 two p atomic orbitals 9: three sp2 hybrid orbitals

7.4  atomic orbitals; hybridization
With carbon:
one s atomic orbital 1 three p atomic orbitals 9: four sp3 hybrid orbitals
You will recall that the bond angles in NH3 and H2O are very close to that in CH4. 
This suggests that the four electron pairs surrounding the central atom in NH3 and H2O, 
like those in CH4, occupy sp3 hybrid orbitals. In NH3, three of these orbitals are filled by 
bonding electrons, the other by the unshared pair on the nitrogen atom. In H2O, two of 
the sp3 orbi­tals of the oxygen atom contain bonding electron pairs; the other two contain 
unshared pairs. The situation in NH3 and H2O is not unique. In general, we find that 
unshared as well as shared electron pairs can be located in hybrid orbitals.
The extra electron pairs in an expanded octet are accommodated by using d orbitals. 
The phosphorus atom (five valence electrons) in PCl5 and the sulfur atom (six valence 
electrons) in SF6 make use of 3d as well as 3s and 3p orbitals:
With phosphorus:
one s orbital 1 three p orbitals 1 one d orbital 9: five sp3d hybrid orbitals
With sulfur:
one s orbital 1 three p orbitals 1 two d orbitals 9: six sp3d2 hybrid orbitals
Table 7.4 summarizes all we have said about hybrid orbitals and also describes their 
geometry. Note that
•	 the number of hybrid orbitals formed is always equal to the number of atomic orbitals mixed.
•	 the geometries, as found mathematically by quantum mechanics, are exactly as pre-
dicted by VSEPR theory. In each case, the hybrid orbitals are directed to be as far 
apart as possible.

chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
Multiple Bonds
In Section 7.2, we saw that insofar as geometry is concerned, a multiple bond acts as if it 
were a single bond. In other words, the extra electron pairs in a double or triple bond 
have no effect on the geometry of the molecule. This behavior is related to hybridization. 
The extra electron pairs in a multiple bond (one pair in a double bond, two pairs in a 
triple bond) are not located in hybrid orbitals.
To illustrate this rule, consider the ethylene (C2H4) and acetylene (C2H2) molecules. 
You will recall that the bond angles in these molecules are 1208 for ethylene and 1808 for 
acetylene. This implies sp2 hybridization in C2H4 and sp hybridization in C2H2 (see Table 
7.4). Using blue lines to represent hybridized electron pairs,

Sigma and Pi Bonds
We have noted that the extra electron pairs in a multiple bond are not hybridized and 
have no effect on molecular geometry. At this point, you may well wonder what hap-
pened to those electrons. Where are they in molecules like C2H4 and C2H2?
To answer this question, it is necessary to consider the shape or spatial distribution 
of the orbitals filled by bonding electrons in molecules. From this point of view, we can 
distinguish between two types of bonding orbitals. The first of these, and by far the more 
common, is called a sigma bonding orbital. It consists of a single lobe:

in which the electron density is concentrated in the region directly between the two 
bonded atoms, A and B. A sigma (s) bond consists of an electron pair occupying a sig-
ma bonding orbital.
The unhybridized electron pairs associated with multiple bonds occupy orbitals of a 
quite different shape, called pi (p) bonding orbitals. Such an orbital consists of two 
lobes, one above the bond axis, the other below it.
A
B
Along the bond axis itself, the electron density is zero. The electron pair of a pi (p) bond 
occupies a pi bonding orbital. There is one p bond in the C2H4 molecule, two in C2H2. 
The geometries of the bonding orbitals in ethylene and acetylene are shown in Figure 7.16 
(page 219).
In general, to find the number of s and p bonds in a species, remember that
•	 all single bonds are sigma bonds.
•	 one of the electron pairs in a multiple bond is a sigma bond; the others are pi bonds.
Sigma and pi orbitals, like s and p, differ 
in shape; each orbital can hold 2e2.

The Noble Gases
The modern periodic table contains six relatively unreactive gases 
that were unknown to mendeleev: the noble gases that make up 
Group 18 at the far right of the table. The fi rst of these elements to 
be isolated was argon, which makes up about 0.9% of air. The 
physicist lord Rayleigh (1842–1919) found that the density of at-
mospheric nitrogen, obtained by removing O2, CO2, and H2O from 
air, was slightly greater than that of chemically pure N2 
(mm 5 28.02 g/mol). Following up on that observation, Sir William 
Ramsay (1852–1916) separated argon (mm 5 39.95 g/mol) from 
air. Over a three-year period between 1895 and 1898, this remark-
able Scotsman, who never took a formal course in chemistry, iso-
lated three more noble gases: Ne, kr, and xe. in eff ect, Ramsay 
added a whole new group to the periodic table.
Helium, the fi rst member of the group, was detected in the 
spectrum of the Sun in 1868. Because of its low density (1
7 that of 
CHemiSTRY bEYOND tHE claSSrOOM
air), helium is used in all kinds of balloons and in synthetic atmo-
spheres to make breathing easier for people suff ering from 
emphysema.
Research laboratories use helium as a liquid coolant to achieve 
very low temperatures (bp He 5 22698C). Argon and, more re-
cently, krypton are used to provide an inert atmosphere in light-
bulbs, thereby extending the life of the tungsten fi lament. in neon 
signs, a high voltage is passed through a glass tube containing neon 
at very low pressures. The red glow emitted corresponds to an 
intense line at 640 nm in the neon spectrum.
Until about 40 years ago, these elements were referred to as 
“inert gases”; they were believed to be entirely unreactive toward 
other substances. in 1962 Neil Bartlett (1932–2008), a 29-year-
old chemist at the University of British Columbia, shook up the 
world of chemistry by preparing the fi rst noble-gas compound. in 
the course of his research on platinum-fl uorine compounds, he iso-
continued

chapter SEVEN  Covalent Bonding
lated a reddish solid that he showed to be O21(PtF62). Bartlett real-
ized that the ionization energy of Xe (1170 kJ/mol) is virtually iden-
tical to that of the O2 molecule (1165 kJ/mol). This encouraged 
him to attempt to make the analogous compound XePtF6. His 
success opened up a new era in noble-gas chemistry.
The most stable binary compounds of xenon are the three fluo-
rides, XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6. Xenon difluoride can be prepared quite 
simply by exposing a 1:1 mol mixture of xenon and fluorine to ultra-
violet light; colorless crystals of XeF2 (mp 5 1298C) form slowly.
Xe(g) 1 F2(g) 9: XeF2(s)
The higher fluorides are prepared using excess fluorine (Figure 
A). All these compounds are stable in dry air at room temperature. 
However, they react with water to form compounds in which one 
or more of the fluorine atoms has been replaced by oxygen. Thus 
xenon hexafluoride reacts rapidly with water to give the trioxide
XeF6(s) 1 3H2O(l) 9: XeO3(s) 1 6HF(g)
Xenon trioxide is highly unstable; it detonates if warmed above 
room temperature.
In the past 40 years, compounds have been isolated in which 
xenon is bonded to several nonmetals (N, C, and Cl) in addition to fluo-
rine and oxygen. In the year 2000, it was reported (Science, Volume 
290, page 117) that a compound had been isolated in which a metal 
atom was bonded to 
xenon. This compound 
is a dark red solid 
stable at temperatures 
below 2408C; it is be-
lieved to contain the 
[AuXe4]21 cation.
The chemistry of 
xenon is much more 
extensive than that of 
any other noble gas. 
Only one binary com-
pound 
of 
krypton, 
KrF2, has been pre-
pared. It is a colorless 
solid that decomposes 
at room temperature. 
The 
chemistry 
of 
radon is difficult to study because all its isotopes are radioac-
tive. Indeed, the radiation given off is so intense that it decomposes 
any reagent added to radon in an attempt to bring about a reaction.
A group in Finland synthesized HArF, the first known compound of 
argon.

his chapter deals with energy and heat, two terms used widely by both the general 
public and scientists. Energy, in the vernacular, is equated with pep and vitality. Heat 
conjures images of blast furnaces and sweltering summer days. Scientifically, these 
terms have quite different meanings. Energy can be defined as the capacity to do work. Heat 
is a particular form of energy that is transferred from a body at a high temperature to one 
at a lower temperature when they are brought into contact with each other. Two centuries 
ago, heat was believed to be a material fluid (caloric); we still use the phrase “heat flow” to 
refer to heat transfer or to heat effects in general.
Thermochemistry refers to the study of the heat flow that accompanies chemical reac-
tions. Our discussion of this subject will focus on
• the basic principles of heat flow (Section 8.1).
• the experimental measurement of the magnitude and direction of heat flow, known as 
calorimetry (Section 8.2).
• the concept of enthalpy, H (heat content) and enthalpy change, DH (Section 8.3).
• the calculation of DH for reactions, using thermochemical equations (Section 8.4) and 
enthalpies of formation (Section 8.5).
• heat effects in the breaking and formation of covalent bonds (Section 8.6).

• the relation between heat and other forms of energy, as expressed by the first law of 
thermodynamics (Section 8.7).
8.1 Principles of Heat Flow
In any discussion of heat flow, it is important to distinguish between system and sur-
roundings. The system is that part of the universe on which attention is focused. In a 
very simple case (Figure 8.1, page 226), it might be a sample of water in contact with a 
hot plate. The surroundings, which exchange energy with the system, make up in prin-
ciple the rest of the universe. For all practical purposes, however, they include only those 
materials in close contact with the system. In Figure 8.1, the surroundings would consist 
of the hot plate, the beaker holding the water sample, and the air around it.
When a chemical reaction takes place, we consider the substances involved, reac-
tants and products, to be the system. The surroundings include the vessel in which the 
reaction takes place (test tube, beaker, and so on) and the air or other material in thermal 
contact with the reaction system.
State Properties
The state of a system is described by giving its composition, temperature, and pressure. 
The system at the left of Figure 8.1 consists of
50.0 g of H2O(l) at 50.08C and 1 atm
When this system is heated, its state changes, perhaps to one described as
50.0 g of H2O(l) at 80.08C and 1 atm
Certain quantities, called state properties, depend only on the state of the system, 
not on the way the system reached that state. Putting it another way, if X is a state prop-
erty, then
DX 5 Xfinal 2 Xinitial
That is, the change in X is the difference between its values in final and initial states. Most 
of the quantities that you are familiar with are state properties; volume is a common 
When the system (50.0 g of H2O) 
absorbs heat from the surround-
ings (hot plate), its temperature 
increases from 50.0°C to 80.0°C.
When the hot plate is turned 
oﬀ, the system gives oﬀ heat to 
the surrounding air, and its 
temperature drops.
50.0 g H2O
50.0°C → 80.0°C
50.0 g H2O
80.0°C → 50.0°C

8.1  principles of heat flow
example. You may be surprised to learn, however, that heat flow is not a state property; 
its magnitude depends on how a process is carried out (Section 8.7).
Direction and Sign of Heat Flow
Consider again the setup in Figure 8.1 (page 226). If the hot plate is turned on, there is a 
flow of heat from the surroundings into the system, 50.0 g of water. This situation is de-
scribed by stating that the heat flow, q, for the system is a positive quantity.
q is positive when heat flows into the system from the surroundings.
Usually, when heat flows into a system, its temperature rises. In this case, the tempera-
ture of the 50.0-g water sample might increase from 50.08C to 80.08C. When the hot 
plate in Figure 8.1 (page 226) is shut off, the hot water gives off heat to the surrounding 
air. In this case, q for the system is a negative quantity.
q is negative when heat flows out of the system into the surroundings.
As is usually the case, the temperature of the system drops when heat flows out of it into 
the surroundings. The 50.0-g water sample might cool from 80.08C back to 50.08C.
This same reasoning can be applied to a reaction in which the system consists of the 
reaction mixture (products and reactants). We can distinguish between
•	 an endothermic process (q . 0), in which heat flows from the surroundings into the 
reaction system. An example is the melting of ice:
H2O(s) 9: H2O(l)    q . 0
	
The melting of ice absorbs heat from the surroundings, which might be the water in a 
glass of iced tea. The temperature of the surroundings drops, perhaps from 258C to 
38C, as they give up heat to the system.
•	 an exothermic process (q , 0), in which heat flows from the reaction system into 
the surroundings. A familiar example is the combustion of methane, the major com-
ponent of natural gas.
CH4(g) 1 2 O2(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 2H2O(l)    q , 0
This reaction evolves heat to the surroundings, which might be the air around a Bunsen 
burner in the laboratory or a potato being baked in a gas oven. In either case, the effect 
of the heat transfer is to raise the temperature of the surroundings.
Magnitude of Heat Flow
In any process, we are interested not only in the direction of heat flow but also in its mag-
nitude. We will express q in the units introduced in Chapter 6, joules and kilojoules. The 
joule is named for James Joule (1818–1889), who carried out very precise thermometric 
measurements that established the first law of thermodynamics (Section 8.7).
In the past, chemists used the calorie* as an energy unit. This is the amount of heat 
required to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree Celsius. The calorie is 
a larger energy unit than the joule:
1 cal 5 4.184 J    1 kcal 5 4.184 kJ
Most of the remainder of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of the magnitude of 
the heat flow in chemical reactions or phase changes. However, we will focus on a sim-
pler process in which the only effect of the heat flow is to change the temperature of a 
system. In general, the relationship between the magnitude of the heat flow, q, and the 
temperature change, Dt, is given by the equation
q 5 C 3 Dt    (Dt 5 tfinal 2 tinitial)
endo 5 into system; exo 5 out of system.
When money flows into your check-
ing account, it is a positive quantity. 
When money flows out, it is a negative 
quantity.

chapter EIGHT  Thermochemistry
The quantity C appearing in this equation is known as the heat capacity of the system. It 
represents the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the system 18C and 
has the units J/8C.
For a pure substance of a certain mass, the expression for q can be written
	
q = mass 3 c 3 t	
(8.1)
The quantity c is called the specific heat or specific heat capacity. (In this text, we will 
use the term specific heat.) Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat required to raise 
the temperature of one gram of a substance one degree Celsius. When the mass of that 
substance is equal to its molar mass, then c is called the molar heat capacity.
Specific heat, like density or melting point, is an intensive property that can be used  
to identify a substance or determine its purity. Water has an unusually large specific heat, 
4.18 J/g8C. This explains why swimming is not a popular pastime in northern Minne-
sota in May. Even if the air temperature rises to 908F, the water temperature will remain 
below 608F. Metals have a relatively low specific heat (Table 8.1, page 229). When you 
heat water in a stainless steel saucepan, for example, nearly all of the heat is absorbed by 
the water, very little by the steel.

8.2 Measurement of Heat Flow; Calorimetry
To measure the heat flow in a reaction, a device known as a calorimeter is used. The ap-
paratus contains water and/or other materials of known heat capacity. The walls of the 
calorimeter are insulated so that there is no exchange of heat with the surrounding air. It 
follows that the only heat flow is between the reaction system and the calorimeter. The 
heat flow for the reaction system is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the 
calorimeter:
qreaction 5 2qcalorimeter
Notice that if the reaction is exothermic (qreaction , 0), qcalorimeter must be positive; that is, 
heat flows from the reaction mixture into the calorimeter. Conversely, if the reaction is 
endothermic, the calorimeter gives up heat to the reaction mixture.
The equation just written is basic to calorimetric measurements. It allows you to 
calculate the amount of heat absorbed or evolved in a reaction if you know the heat ca-
pacity, Ccal, and the temperature change, Dt, of the calorimeter.

Coffee-Cup Calorimeter
Figure 8.2 shows a simple coffee-cup calorimeter used in the general chemistry labora-
tory. It consists of two nested polystyrene foam cups partially filled with water. The cups 
have a tightly fitting cover through which an accurate thermometer is inserted. Because 
polystyrene foam is a good insulator, there is very little heat flow through the walls of the 
cups. Essentially all the heat evolved by a reaction taking place within the calorimeter is 
absorbed by the water. This means that, to a good degree of approximation, the heat ca-
pacity of the coffee-cup calorimeter is that of the water:

8.2  measurement of heat flow; calorimetry
Bomb Calorimeter
A coffee-cup calorimeter is suitable for measuring heat flow for reactions in solution. 
However, it cannot be used for reactions involving gases, which would escape from the 
cup. Neither would it be appropriate for reactions in which the products reach high tem-
peratures. The bomb calorimeter, shown in Figure 8.3 (page 232), is more versatile. To 
use it, a weighed sample of the reactant(s) is added to the heavy-walled metal vessel 
called a “bomb.” This is then sealed and lowered into the insulated outer container. An 
amount of water sufficient to cover the bomb is added, and the entire apparatus is closed. 
The initial temperature is measured precisely. The reaction is then started, perhaps by 
electrical ignition. In an exothermic reaction, the hot products give off heat to the walls 
of the bomb and to the water. The final temperature is taken to be the highest value read 
on the thermometer.

chapter EIGHT  Thermochemistry
All of the heat given off by the reaction is absorbed by the calorimeter, which con-
sists of the metal bomb and the water that surrounds it. In other words,
qreaction 5 2(qcalorimeter 1 qH2O)
As discussed earlier, the heat absorbed by the water can be determined by substituting 
into Equation 8.1:
qH2O 5 c 3 massH2O 3 Dt
The heat absorbed by the calorimeter is equal to the product of its heat capacity (unique 
to each calorimeter), Ccal, and the temperature change, Dt:
	
qcalorimeter 5 Ccal 3 Dt 
(8.3)
To find the heat capacity, Ccal, the experiment is repeated using the same bomb and 
the same amount of water. This time, though, we carry out a reaction for which the 
amount of heat evolved is known, 93.3 kJ. The temperature increase is again measured 
carefully. Suppose that the water in the calorimeter can has a mass of 1.00 kg (1000 g) and 
the temperature rises from 20.008C to 30.008C, then q for the water would be 41.8 kJ and 
q for the calorimeter would then be
93.3 kJ 2 41.8 kJ 5 51.5 kJ
Substituting into Equation 8.3 we obtain the heat capacity of the calorimeter.
Ccal 5 51.5 kJ

Knowing the heat capacity of the calorimeter, the heat flow for any reaction taking place 
in that calorimeter can be calculated (Example 8.3).

8.3  enthalpy
8.3 Enthalpy
We have referred several times to the “heat flow for the reaction system,” symbolized as 
qreaction. At this point, you may well find this concept a bit nebulous and wonder if it could 
be made more concrete by relating qreaction to some property of reactants and products. 
This can indeed be done; the situation is particularly simple for reactions taking place at 
constant pressure. Under that condition, the heat flow for the reaction system is equal to 
the difference in enthalpy (H) between products and reactants. That is,
qreaction at constant pressure 5 DH 5 Hproducts 2 Hreactants
Enthalpy is a type of chemical energy, sometimes referred to as “heat content.” Reactions 
that occur in the laboratory in an open container or in the world around us take place at 
a constant pressure, that of the atmosphere. For such reactions, the equation just written 
is valid, making enthalpy a very useful quantity.
EXAMPLE 8.3
Hydrogen chloride is used in etching semiconductors. It can be prepared by reacting hydrogen and chlorine gases.
H2(g) 1 C12(g) 9: 2HCl(g)
It is found that when 1.00 g of H2  is made to react completely with Cl2 in a bomb calorimeter with a heat capacity of 
5.15 kJ/C, the temperature in the bomb rises from 20.00C to 29.82C. The calorimeter can hold 1.000 kg of water. How

chapter EIGHT  Thermochemistry
Figure 8.4a shows the enthalpy relationship between reactants and products for an 
exothermic reaction such as
CH4(g) 1 2 O2(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 2H2O(l)    DH , 0
Here, the products, 1 mol of CO2(g) and 2 mol of H2O(l), have a lower enthalpy than the 
reactants, 1 mol of CH4(g) and 2 mol of O2(g). The decrease in enthalpy is the source of 
the heat evolved to the surroundings. Figure 8.4b shows the situation for an endother-
mic process such as
H2O(s) 9: H2O(l)    DH . 0
Liquid water has a higher enthalpy than ice, so heat must be transferred from the sur-
roundings to melt the ice.
In general, the following relations apply for reactions taking place at constant 
pressure.
	
exothermic reaction:	
q 5 DH , 0    Hproducts , Hreactants
endothermic reaction:    q 5 DH . 0    Hproducts . Hreactants
The enthalpy of a substance, like its volume, is a state property. A sample of one 
gram of liquid water at 25.008C and 1 atm has a fixed enthalpy, H. In practice, no attempt 
is made to determine absolute values of enthalpy. Instead, scientists deal with changes in 
enthalpy, which are readily determined. For the process
1.00 g H2O (l, 25.008C, 1 atm) 9: 1.00 g H2O (l, 26.008C, 1 atm)
DH is 4.18 J because the specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g?8C.
8.4 Thermochemical Equations
A chemical equation that shows the enthalpy relation between products and reactants is 
called a thermochemical equation. This type of equation contains, at the right of the 
balanced chemical equation, the appropriate value and sign for DH.
To see where a thermochemical equation comes from, consider the process by 
which ammonium nitrate dissolves in water:
NH4NO3(s) 9: NH41(aq) 1 NO32(aq)
Laboratory burners fueled by natural 
gas, which is mostly methane.
Charles D. Winters
When CH4 burns, DH is negative; when 
ice melts, DH is positive.
Exothermic

Reactants
In an exothermic reaction, the
products have a lower enthalpy
than the reactants; thus ΔH is
negative, and heat is given oﬀ to
the surroundings.
In an endothermic reaction, the
products have a higher enthalpy

positive and heat is absorbed
from the surroundings.

8.4  thermochemical equations
A simple experiment with a coffee-cup calorimeter shows that when one gram of  
NH4NO3 dissolves, qreaction 5 351 J. The calorimeter is open to the atmosphere, the pres-
sure is constant, and
DH for dissolving 1.00 g of NH4NO3 5 351 J 5 0.351 kJ
When one mole (80.05 g) of NH4NO3 dissolves, DH should be 80 times as great:
DH for dissolving 1.00 mol of NH4NO3 5 0.351 kJ
g  3 80.05 g 5 28.1 kJ 
The thermochemical equation for this reaction (Figure 8.5) must then be
NH4NO3(s) 9: NH41(aq) 1 NO32(aq)    DH 5 128.1 kJ
By an entirely analogous procedure, the thermochemical equation for the formation 
of HCl from the elements (Example 8.3) is found to be
H2(g) 1 Cl2(g) 9: 2HCl(g)    DH 5 2185 kJ
In other words, 185 kJ of heat is evolved when two moles of HCl are formed from H2 
and Cl2.
These thermochemical equations are typical of those used throughout this text. It is 
important to realize that
•	 the sign of DH indicates whether the reaction, when carried out at constant pressure, 
is endothermic (positive DH) or exothermic (negative DH).
•	 in interpreting a thermochemical equation, the coefficients represent numbers of 
moles (DH is 2185 kJ when 1 mol H2 1 1 mol Cl2 : 2 mol HCl).
•	 the phases (physical states) of all species must be specified, using the symbols (s), (l), 
(g), or (aq). The enthalpy of one mole of H2O(g) at 258C is 44 kJ larger than that of one 
mole of H2O(l); the difference, which represents the heat of vaporization of water, is 
clearly significant.
•	 the value quoted for DH applies when products and reactants are at the same tem-
perature, ordinarily taken to be 258C unless specified otherwise.
Rules of Thermochemistry
To make effective use of thermochemical equations, three basic rules of thermochemis-
try are applied.
1.  The magnitude of DH is directly proportional to the amount of reactant or product. 
This is a common-sense rule, consistent with experience. The amount of heat that must be

chapter EIGHT  Thermochemistry
absorbed to boil a sample of water is directly proportional to its mass. In another case, the 
more gasoline you burn in your car’s engine, the more energy you produce.
This rule allows you to find DH corresponding to any desired amount of reactant or 
product. To do this, you follow the conversion-factor approach used in Chapter 3 with ordi-
nary chemical equations. Consider, for example,
H2(g) 1 Cl2(g) 9: 2HCl(g)    DH 5 2185 kJ
The thermochemical equation allows us to relate the enthalpy change to amounts of 
reactants and products, leading to conversion factors such as
2185 kJ
1 mol Cl2  1 mol H2
2185 kJ  
2185 kJ
2 mol HCl
The magnitude of DH is dependent not 
only on the amount of the reactants 
and products but also on their physical 
states.

The heat absorbed when a solid melts (s : l) is referred to as the heat of fusion; that 
absorbed when a liquid vaporizes (l : g) is called the heat of vaporization. Heats of fusion 
(DHfus) and vaporization (DHvap) are most often expressed in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol). 
Values for several different substances are given in Table 8.2 (page 238).

is a direct consequence of the fact that enthalpy is a state property, dependent only on 
DH must be independent of path, since 
H is a state property.

initial and final states. This means that, in Figure 8.6, DH must equal the sum of DH1 and 
DH2, because the final and initial states are the same for the two processes.
Hess’s law is very convenient for obtaining values of DH for reactions that are diffi-
cult to carry out in a calorimeter. Consider, for example, the formation of the toxic gas 
carbon monoxide from the elements
C(s) 1 1
2 O2(g) 9: CO(g)
It is difficult, essentially impossible, to measure DH for this reaction because when 
carbon burns, the major product is always carbon dioxide, CO2. It is possible, however, 
to calculate DH using thermochemical data for two other reactions that are readily car-
ried out in the laboratory (Example 8.6).

2. Focus on species that appear in only one of the thermochemical equations. In this case C appears only in Equation (1) and 
CO appears only in Equation (2).
3. For CO
Compare position and number of moles of CO in Equation 2 and in the desired equation.
    Position: Equation (2)—on the left	
Desired equation—on the right
    Moles: Equation (2)—2 moles	
Desired equation—1 mole
Apply Rule 2 to reverse Equation (2) (to put CO on the right).
Apply Rule 1 and divide Equation (2) by 2 (to get a coefficient of 1 for CO).
4. For C
Compare position and number of moles of C in Equation (1) and in the desired equation.
    Position: Equation (1)—on the left

Both the position and coefficient for C are okay, so use Equation (1) “as is.”

chapter EIGHT  Thermochemistry
Summarizing the rules of thermochemistry:
	 1.	 DH is directly proportional to the amount of reactant or product.
	 2.	 DH changes sign when a reaction is reversed.
	 3.	 DH for a reaction has the same value regardless of the number of steps.
8.5 Enthalpies of Formation
We have now written several thermochemical equations. In each case, we have cited the 
corresponding value of DH. Literally thousands of such equations would be needed to 
list the DH values for all the reactions that have been studied. Clearly, there has to be 
some more concise way of recording data of this sort. These data should be in a form that 
can easily be used to calculate DH for any reaction. It turns out that there is a simple way 
to do this, using quantities known as enthalpies of formation.
Meaning of DHf8
The standard molar enthalpy of formation of a compound, DHf8, is equal to the en-
thalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed at a constant pressure of 1 atm 
and a fixed temperature, ordinarily 258C, from the elements in their stable states at that 
pressure and temperature. From the equations
	
Ag(s, 258C) 1 1
2Cl2(g, 258C, 1 atm) 9: AgCl(s, 258C)	
DH 5 2127.1 kJ

2N2(g, 1 atm, 258C) 1 O2(g, 1 atm, 258C) 9: NO2(g, 1 atm, 258C)    DH 5 133.2 kJ 
it follows that
DHf8 AgCl(s) 5 2127.1 kJ/mol    DHf8 NO2(g) 5 133.2 kJ/mol
Enthalpies of formation for a variety of compounds are listed in Table 8.3. Notice 
that, with a few exceptions, enthalpies of formation are negative quantities. This 
means that the formation of a compound from the elements is ordinarily exothermic. 
Conversely, when a compound decomposes to the elements, heat usually must be 
absorbed.
You will note from Table 8.3 that there are no entries for elemental species such as 
Br2(l) and O2(g). This is a consequence of the way in which enthalpies of formation are 
solution

defined. In effect, the enthalpy of formation of an element in its stable state at 258C and 
1 atm is taken to be zero. That is,
DHf8 Br2(l) 5 DHf8 O2(g) 5 0
The standard enthalpies of formation of ions in aqueous solution listed at the bot-
tom of Table 8.3 are relative values, established by taking
DHf8 H1(aq) 5 0
From the values listed we see that the Cu21 ion has a heat of formation greater than 
that of H1 by about 65 kJ/mol, and Cd21 has a heat of formation about 76 kJ/mol less 
than that of H1.
Calculation of DH8
Enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate DH8 for a reaction. To do this, apply 
this general rule:
The standard enthalpy change, DH8, for a given thermochemical equation is equal to the 
sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the product compounds minus the sum 
of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactant compounds.
Using the symbol S to represent “the sum of,”
 
DH8 5 S DHf8 products 2 S DHf8 reactants 
(8.4)
In applying this equation
•	 elements in their standard states can be omitted, because their heats of formation are 
zero. To illustrate, consider the thermite reaction once used to weld rails (Figure 8.7).
2Al(s) 1 Fe2O3(s) 9: 2Fe(s) 1 Al2O3(s)
We can write, quite simply,
DH8 5 S DHf8 products 2 S DHf8 reactants 5 DHf8 Al2O3(s) 2 DHf8 Fe2O3(s)
This is a very useful equation, one we 
will use again and again.

mixture of aluminum powder

The burning magnesium initiates the exothermic reaction:

•	 the coefficients of products and reactants in the thermochemical equation must be 
taken into account. For example, consider the reaction:
2Al(s) 1 3Cu21(aq) 9: 2Al31(aq) 1 3Cu(s)
for which:
DH8 5 2DHf8 Al31(aq) 2 3DHf8 Cu21(aq)
Strictly speaking, DH8 calculated from enthalpies of formation listed in Table 8.3 
(page 241) represents the enthalpy change at 258C and 1 atm. Actually, DH is indepen-
dent of pressure and varies relatively little with temperature, changing by perhaps 1 to 
10 kJ per 1008C.

The relation between DH8 and enthalpies of formation is perhaps used more often 
than any other in thermochemistry. Its validity depends on the fact that enthalpy is a 
state property. For any reaction, DH8 can be obtained by imagining that the reaction 
takes place in two steps. First, the reactants (compounds or ions) are converted to the 
elements:
reactants 9: elements    DH18 5 2SDHf8 reactants
Then the elements are converted to products:

8.6 Bond Enthalpy
For many reactions, DH is a large negative number; the reaction gives off a lot of heat. In 
other cases, DH is positive; heat must be absorbed for the reaction to occur. You may well 
wonder why the enthalpy change should vary so widely from one reaction to another. Is 
there some basic property of the molecules involved in the reaction that determines the 
sign and magnitude of DH?
These questions can be answered on a molecular level in terms of a quantity known 
as bond enthalpy. (More commonly but less properly it is called bond energy.) The bond 
enthalpy is defined as DH when one mole of bonds is broken in the gaseous state. From 
the equations (see also Figure 8.9, page 247).

Cl2(g)
H2(g)

ΔH = +436 kJ
ΔH = +243 kJ

it follows that the H ! H bond enthalpy is 1436 kJ/mol and that for Cl ! Cl is 
243 kJ/mol. In both reactions, one mole of bonds (H ! H and Cl ! Cl) is broken.
Bond enthalpies for a variety of single and multiple bonds are listed in Table 8.4 (page 
247). Note that bond enthalpy is always a positive quantity; heat is always absorbed when 
chemical bonds are broken. Conversely, heat is given off when bonds are formed from 
gaseous atoms. Thus
H(g)  +   Cl(g) 
HCl(g)
HF(g)
H(g)  +   F(g) 
ΔH = –431 kJ
ΔH = –565 kJ
Using bond enthalpies, it is possible to explain why certain gas phase reactions are 
endothermic and others are exothermic. In general, a reaction is expected to be endo-
thermic (i.e., heat must be absorbed) if
•	 the bonds in the reactants are stronger than those in the products. Consider, for exam-
ple, the decomposition of hydrogen fluoride to the elements, which can be shown to 
be endothermic from the data in Table 8.3 (page 241).

When you use Table 8.3 to figure out ∆H8 for a reaction, make sure you consider the physical state of the species. Water, for 
example, has 2 different ∆Hf 8 values given: one for liquid and the other for gas. By the same token, do not forget to write 
the physical state of each species when you write an equation to represent a reaction.

chapter EIGHT  Thermochemistry
This effect is a reasonable one; the greater the number of bonding electrons, the more 
difficult it should be to break the bond between two atoms.
We should point out a serious limitation of the bond enthalpies listed in Table 8.4. 
Whenever the bond involves two different atoms (e.g., O 9 H) the value listed is approxi-
mate rather than exact, because it represents an average taken over two or more different 
species. Consider, for example, the O 9 H bond where we find
H 9 O 9 H(g) 9: H(g) 1 OH(g)    DH 5 1499 kJ
	
H 9 O(g) 9: H(g) 1 O(g)	
DH 5 1428 kJ
Both of these reactions involve breaking a mole of O 9 H bonds, yet the experimental 
values of DH are quite different. The bond enthalpy listed in Table 8.4, 464 kJ/mol, is an 
average of these two values.
This limitation explains why, whenever possible, we use enthalpies of formation 
(DHf8) rather than bond enthalpies to calculate the value of DH for a reaction. Calcula-
tions involving enthalpies of formation are expected to be accurate within 60.1 kJ; the 
use of bond enthalpies can result in an error of 10 kJ or more.
8.7 The First Law of Thermodynamics
So far in this chapter our discussion has focused on thermochemistry, the study of the 
heat effects in chemical reactions. Thermochemistry is a branch of thermodynamics, 
which deals with all kinds of energy effects in all kinds of processes. Thermodynamics 
distinguishes between two types of energy. One of these is heat (q); the other is work, 
represented by the symbol w. The thermodynamic definition of work is quite different 
from its colloquial meaning. Quite simply, work includes all forms of energy except 
heat.
The law of conservation of energy states that energy (E) can be neither created nor 
destroyed; it can only be transferred between system and surroundings. That is,
DEsystem 5 2DEsurroundings
The first law of thermodynamics goes a step further. Taking account of the fact that there 
are two kinds of energy, heat and work, the first law states:
In any process, the total change in energy of a system, DE, is equal to the sum of the heat, q, 
and the work, w, transferred between the system and the surroundings.
 
DE 5 q 1 w 
(8.5)
In applying the first law, note (Figure 8.10, page 249) that q and w are positive when 
heat or work enters the system from the surroundings. If the transfer is in the opposite 
direction, from system to surroundings, q and w are negative.
If work is done on the system or if heat 
is added to it, its energy increases.
EXAMPLE 8.9
Calculate DE of a gas for a process in which the gas
(a)  absorbs 20 J of heat and does 12 J of work by expanding.
(b)  evolves 30 J of heat and has 52 J of work done on it as it contracts.

8.7  the first law of thermodynamics
Ordinarily, when a chemical reaction is carried out in the laboratory, any energy 
evolved is in the form of heat. Consider, for example, the reaction of oxygen with meth-
ane, the principal constituent of natural gas.
CH4(g) 1 2 O2(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 2H2O(l)    DE 5 2885 kJ
When you ignite methane in a Bunsen burner, the amount of heat evolved is very close to 
885 kJ/mol. There is a small work effect, due to the decrease in volume that occurs when 
the reaction takes place (Figure 8.11), but this amounts to less than 1% of the energy change.
The situation changes if methane is used as a substitute for gasoline in an internal 
combustion engine. Here a significant fraction of the energy evolved in combustion is 
converted to useful work, propelling your car uphill, overcoming friction, charging the 
battery, or whatever. Depending on the efficiency of the engine, as much as 25% of the 
available energy might be converted to work; the amount of heat evolved through the tail 
pipe or radiator drops accordingly.

When the reaction

is carried out in a cylinder fitted with a 
piston that exerts a pressure of 1 atm, a 
contraction occurs (3 mol gas : 1 mol 
gas). The piston falls, and a small 
amount of work is done on the reaction 
system.
STRATEGY
1.  Decide on the signs for work (w) and heat (q).
Recall that quantites are positive when they enter the system (absorbed, work done on the system) and negative when 
they leave the system (evolved, work done by the system).
2. Substitute into Equation 8.5.

chapter EIGHT  Thermochemistry
Finally, the energy available from the above reaction might be used to operate a fuel 
cell such as those involved in the space program. In that case, as much as 818 kJ/mol of 
useful electrical work could be obtained; relatively little heat is evolved. Summarizing 
this discussion in terms of an energy balance (per mole of methane reacting):

Notice that DE, like DH, is a state property; it has the same value regardless of how or 
where or why the reaction is carried out. In contrast, q and w are path-dependent; their 
values vary depending on whether the reaction is carried out in the atmosphere, an en-
gine, or an electrical cell.
DH  Versus DE
As noted earlier, for a reaction at constant pressure, such as that taking place in an open 
coffee-cup calorimeter, the heat flow is equal to the change in enthalpy. If a reaction is 
carried out at constant volume (as is the case in a sealed bomb calorimeter) and there is 
no mechanical or electrical work involved, no work is done. Under these conditions, 
with w 5 0, the heat flow is equal to the change in energy, DE. Hence we have
DH 5 qp    DE 5 qv
(qp 5 heat flow at constant pressure, qv 5 heat flow at constant volume).
Almost always, when you carry out a reaction in the laboratory, you do so at con-
stant pressure, that of the atmosphere. That is why we devoted 90% of the space in this 
chapter to DH rather than DE.
We can obtain a relation between DH and DE for a chemical reaction at constant 
temperature by starting with the defining equation relating enthalpy, H, to energy, E:
H 5 E 1 PV
where V is the volume at pressure P. It follows that
DH 5 DE 1 D(PV)
To evaluate D(PV) for a reaction note that
•	 the PV product for a liquid or solid can be ignored, since their molar volume is typi-
cally only about 0.1% of that for a gas.
•	 gases taking part in the reaction can be assumed to obey the ideal gas law, PV 5 nRT.
It follows that
D(PV) 5 DngRT
where Dng is the change in the number of moles of gas when the reaction takes place. 
Finally, we obtain the relation
 
DH 5 DE 1 DngRT 
(8.6)

Recall that DE for this reaction is 2885 kJ; it follows that DH is 2890 kJ. The difference 
between DE and DH is less than 1%, which is typical for most reactions. Figure 8.11 (page

chapter eIGht  Thermochemistry
Energy Balance in the Human Body
All of us require energy to maintain life processes and do the mus-
cular work associated with such activities as studying, writing, 
walking, or jogging. The fuel used to produce that energy is the 
food we eat. In this discussion, we focus on energy input or energy 
output and the balance between them.
Energy Input
Energy values of food can be estimated on the basis of the content 
of carbohydrate, protein, and fat:
carbohydrate:  17 kJ (4.0 kcal) of energy per gram*
 
protein:  17 kJ (4.0 kcal) of energy per gram
 
fat:  38 kJ (9.0 kcal) of energy per gram
Alcohol, which doesn’t fi t into any of these categories, furnishes 
about 29 kJ (7.0 kcal) per gram.
CHEMISTRy beYONd the claSSrOOM
using these guidelines, it is possible to come up with the data 
given in Table A, which lists approximate energy values for standard 
portions of diff erent types of foods. With a little practice, you can 
use the table to estimate your energy input within 610%.
Energy Output
Energy output can be divided, more or less arbitrarily, into two 
categories.
1. Metabolic energy. This is the largest item in most people’s 
energy budget; it comprises the energy necessary to maintain life. 
Metabolic rates are ordinarily estimated based on a person’s sex, 
weight, and age. For a young adult female, the metabolic rate is 
about 100 kJ per day per kilogram of body weight. For a 20-year-
old woman weighing 120 lb
metabolic rate 5 120 lb 3 1 kg
2.20 lb
 3 100 kJ
d # kg
 
5 5500 kJ/d (1300 kcal/day)
For a young adult male of the same weight, the fi gure is about 15% 
higher.
2. Muscular activity. Energy is consumed whenever your 
muscles contract, whether in writing, walking, playing tennis, or 
even sitting in class. Generally speaking, energy expenditure for 
muscular activity ranges from 50% to 100% of metabolic energy, 
depending on lifestyle. If the 20-year-old woman referred to earlier 
is a student who does nothing more strenuous than lift textbooks 
(and that not too often), the energy spent on muscular activity 
might be
0.50 3 5500 kJ 5 2800 kJ
d
Her total energy output per day would be 5500 kJ 1 2800 kJ 5 
8300 kJ (2000 kcal).
Energy Balance
To maintain constant weight, your daily energy input, as calculated 
from the foods you eat, should be about 700 kJ (170 kcal) greater 
than output. The diff erence allows for the fact that about 40 g of 
protein is required to maintain body tissues and fl uids. If the excess 
of input over output is greater than 700 kJ/day, the unused food 
(carbohydrate, protein, or fat) is converted to fatty tissue and 
stored as such in the body.
Fatty tissue consists of about 85% fat and 15% water; its energy 
value is
0.85 3 9.0 kcal
g  3 454 g
1 lb
 5 3500 kcal/lb
This means that to lose one pound of fat, energy input from foods 
must be decreased by about 3500 kcal. To lose weight at a sensi-
ble rate of one pound per week, it is necessary to cut down by 
500 kcal (2100 kJ) per day.
It’s also possible, of course, to lose weight by increasing muscu-
lar activity. Table b (page 253) shows the amount of energy

In Chapter 5, we pointed out that at ordinary temperatures and pressures, all gases follow 
the ideal gas law. In this chapter we will examine liquids and solids. Unfortunately, there are 
no simple relations analogous to the ideal gas law that correlate the properties of these 
two physical states. 
• In Section 9.1 we will compare some of the properties of the three different phases and 
give two reasons for this difference in behavior. 
• Section 9.2 will focus on the different phases of a pure substance. We will consider 
different phenomena related to gas-liquid equilibria, including vapor pressure, boiling 
point behavior, and critical properties. 
• Section 9.3 deals with phase diagrams, which describe all these types of phase 
equilibria (gas-liquid, gas-solid, and liquid-solid). 
• Section 9.4 explores the relationship between particle structure, interparticle forces, 
and physical properties in molecular substances. 
• Section 9.5 extends the discussion to nonmolecular solids (network covalent, ionic, and 
metallic). 
• Section 9.6 is devoted to the crystal structure of ionic and metallic solids.

“Ice Flows on the Seine” by Claude Monet/Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY
Ice, seen floating on the water in the 
painting, has its water molecules 
arranged in an open hexagonal 
pattern. This is a result of hydrogen 
bonding. The large portion of open 
space in the structure explains why 
ice floats on water.

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
9.1 Comparing Solids, Liquids, and Gases
Why are liquids and solids so different from gases? There are two reasons for this differ-
ence in behavior. 
1.  Molecules are much closer to one another in liquids and solids. In the gas state, particles 
are typically separated by ten molecular diameters or more; in liquids and solids, they touch 
one another. This explains why liquids and solids have densities so much larger than those 
of gases. At 1008C, 1 atm, water (H2O(l)) has a density of 0.95 g/mL; that of steam 
(H2O(g)) under the same condition is only 0.00059 g/mL (Table 9.1). Because of such small 
numbers for gas densities, they are usually given in g/L, whereas those of liquids and solids 
are in g/mL. 
Table 9.1 also shows that the volume of one mole of water and one mole of ice are 
similar, whereas that of steam is about 1500 times greater. The low density and large mo-
lar volume of steam result from the large separation between the water molecules. 
For the same reason, liquids and solids are much less compressible than gases. 
When the pressure on liquid water is increased from 1 to 2 atm, the volume decreases by 
about 0.0045%. The same change in pressure reduces the volume of an equal amount of 
ideal gas by 50%.
2.  Intermolecular forces, which are essentially negligible with gases, play a much more im-
portant role in liquids and solids. Among the effects of these forces is the phenomenon of 
surface tension, shown by liquids. Molecules at the surface are ­attracted inward by unbal-
anced intermolecular forces; as a result, liquids tend to form spherical drops, for which the 
ratio of surface area to volume is as small as possible (Figure 9.1). Water, in which there are 
relatively strong intermolecular forces, has a high surface tension. That of most organic liq-
uids is lower, which ­explains why they tend to “wet” or spread out on solid surfaces more 
readily than water. The wetting ability of water can be increased by adding a soap or deter-
gent, which drastically lowers the surface tension.
9.2 Liquid-Vapor Equilibrium
All of us are familiar with the process of vaporization, in which a liquid is ­converted to a 
gas, commonly referred to as a vapor. In an open container, evaporation continues until 
all the liquid is gone. If the container is closed, the situation is quite different. At first, the 
movement of molecules is primarily in one direction, from liquid to vapor. Here, how-
ever, the vapor molecules cannot ­escape from the container. Some of them collide with 
the surface and re-enter the liquid. As time passes and the concentration of molecules in

9.2  liquid-vapor equilibrium
the vapor ­increases, so does the rate of condensation. When the rate of condensation 
­becomes equal to the rate of vaporization, the liquid and vapor are in a state of dynamic 
equilibrium:
liquid EF vapor
The double arrow implies that the forward and reverse processes are occurring at the 
same rate, which is characteristic of a dynamic equilibrium. The vapor, like any gas, can 
be assumed to obey the ideal gas law.
Vapor Pressure
Once equilibrium between liquid and vapor is reached, the number of molecules per unit 
volume in the vapor does not change with time. This means that the pressure exerted by 
the vapor over the liquid remains constant. The pressure of vapor in equilibrium with a 
liquid is called the vapor pressure. This quantity is a characteristic property of a given 
liquid at a particular temperature. It varies from one liquid to another, depending on the 
strength of the intermolecular forces. At 258C, the vapor pressure of water is 24 mm Hg; 
that of ether, in which intermolecular forces are weaker, is 537 mm Hg.
It is important to realize that so long as both liquid and vapor are present, the pres-
sure exerted by the vapor is independent of the volume of the container. If a small amount 
of liquid is introduced into a closed container, some of it will vaporize, establishing its 
equilibrium vapor pressure. The greater the volume of the container, the greater will be the 
amount of liquid that vaporizes to establish that pressure. The ratio n/V stays constant, so 
P 5 nRT/V does not change. Only if all the liquid vaporizes will the pressure drop below 
the equilibrium value (Figure 9.2).

conditions shown, the bromine liquid 
and vapor have established a dynamic 
equilibrium.

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
Vapor Pressure Versus Temperature
The vapor pressure of a liquid always increases as temperature rises. Water evaporates 
more readily on a hot, dry day. Stoppers in bottles of volatile liquids such as ether or 
gasoline pop out when the temperature rises.
The vapor pressure of water, which is 24 mm Hg at 258C, becomes 92 mm Hg at 
508C and 1 atm (760 mm Hg) at 1008C. The data for water are plotted at the top of Figure 
9.3. As you can see, the graph of vapor pressure versus temperature is not a straight line, 
as it would be if pressure were plotted versus temperature for an ideal gas. Instead, the 
slope increases steadily as temperature rises, reflecting the fact that more molecules va-
porize at higher temperatures. At 1008C, the concentration of H2O molecules in the va-
por in equilibrium with liquid is 25 times as great as at 258C.
In working with the relationship between two variables, such as vapor pressure and 
temperature, scientists prefer to deal with linear (straight-line) functions. Straight-line 
graphs are easier to construct and to interpret. In this case, it is possible to obtain a linear 
function by making a simple shift in variables. Instead of plotting vapor pressure (P) 
versus temperature (T), we plot the natural logarithm* of the vapor pressure (ln P) ver-
sus the reciprocal of the absolute temperature (1/T). Such a plot for water is shown at the 
bottom of Figure 9.3. As with all other liquids, a plot of ln P versus 1/T is a straight line.
The general equation of a straight line is
y 5 mx 1 b    (m 5 slope, b 5 y-intercept)
The y-coordinate in Figure 9.3b is ln P, and the x-coordinate is 1/T. The slope, which is a 
negative quantity, turns out to be 2DHvap/R, where DHvap is the molar heat of vaporiza-
tion and R is the gas constant, in the proper units. Hence the equation of the straight line 
in Figure 9.3b is
ln P 5 
2DHvap
RT

For many purposes, it is convenient to have a two-point relation between the vapor 
pressures (P2, P1) at two different temperatures (T2, T1). Such a relation is ­obtained by 
first writing separate equations at each temperature:
at T2:    ln P2 5 b 2 
DHvap

at T1:    ln P1 5 b 2

This equation is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Rudolph Clausius (1822–
1888) was a prestigious nineteenth-century German scientist. B. P. E. Clapeyron (1799–
1864), a French engineer, first proposed a modified version of the equation in 1834.
In using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the units of DHvap and R must be consis-
tent. If DH is expressed in joules, then R must be expressed in joules per mole per kelvin. 
Recall (Table 5.1) that
R 5 8.31 J/mol · K
This equation can be used to calculate any one of the five variables (P2, P1, T2, T1, and 
DHvap), knowing the values of the other four. For example, we can use it to find the vapor 
pressure (P1) at temperature T1, knowing P2 at T2 and the value of the heat of vaporization 
(Example 9.2).

9.2  liquid-vapor equilibrium
Boiling Point
When a liquid is heated in an open container, bubbles form, usually at the bottom, where 
heat is applied. The first small bubbles are air, driven out of solution by the increase in 
temperature. Eventually, at a certain temperature, large vapor bubbles form throughout 
the liquid. These vapor bubbles rise to the surface, where they break. When this happens, 
the liquid is said to be boiling. For a pure liquid, the temperature remains constant 
throughout the boiling process.
The temperature at which a liquid boils depends on the pressure above it. To under-
stand why this is the case, consider Figure 9.4 (page 266). This shows vapor bubbles 
­rising in a boiling liquid. For a vapor bubble to form, the pressure within it, P1, must be 
at least equal to the pressure above it, P2. Because P1 is simply the vapor pressure of the 
liquid, it follows that a liquid boils at a temperature at which its ­vapor pressure is equal 
to the pressure above its surface. If this pressure is 1 atm (760 mm Hg), the temperature 
is referred to as the normal boiling point. (When the term “boiling point” is used with-
out qualification, normal boiling point is implied.) The normal boiling point of water is 
1008C; its vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg at that temperature.

This value is reasonable. Lowering the temperature (408C to 258C) should decrease the pressure. The answer shows that it 
does (183 mm Hg to 101 mm Hg)!

its normal bp is 760 mm Hg.

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
As you might expect, the boiling point of a liquid can be reduced by lowering the 
pressure above it. Water can be made to boil at 258C by evacuating the space above it. 
When a pressure of 24 mm Hg, the equilibrium vapor pressure at 258C, is reached, the 
water starts to boil. Chemists often take advantage of this effect in purifying a high-
boiling compound that might decompose or oxidize at its normal boiling point. They 
distill it at a reduced temperature under vacuum and condense the vapor.
If you have been fortunate enough to camp in the high Sierras or the Rockies, you 
may have noticed that it takes longer at high altitudes to cook foods in boiling water. The 
reduced pressure lowers the temperature at which water boils in an open container and 
thus slows down the physical and chemical changes that take place when foods like po-
tatoes or eggs are cooked. In principle, this problem can be solved by using a pressure 
cooker. In that device, the pressure that develops is high enough to raise the boiling 
point of water above 1008C. Pressure cookers are indeed used in places like Salt Lake 
City, Utah (elevation 1340 m, bp H2O(l) 5 958C), but not by mountain climbers, who 
have to carry all their equipment on their backs.
Critical Temperature and Pressure
Consider an experiment in which liquid carbon dioxide is introduced into an otherwise 
evacuated glass tube, which is then sealed (Figure 9.5, page 267). At 08C, the pressure 
above the liquid is 34 atm, the equilibrium vapor pressure of CO2(l) at that temperature. 
As the tube is heated, some of the liquid is converted to vapor, and the pressure rises, to 
44 atm at 108C and 56 atm at 208C. Nothing spectacular happens (unless there happens 
to be a weak spot in the tube) until 318C is reached, where the vapor pressure is 73 atm. 
Suddenly, as the temperature goes above 318C, the meniscus between the liquid and va-
por disappears! The tube now contains only one phase.
It is impossible to have liquid carbon dioxide at temperatures above 318C, no matter 
how much pressure is applied. Even at pressures as high as 1000 atm, carbon dioxide gas 
does not liquefy at 35 or 408C. This behavior is typical of all substances. There is a tem-
perature, called the critical temperature, above which the liquid phase of a pure sub-
stance cannot exist. The pressure that must be applied to cause condensation at that 
temperature is called the critical pressure. Quite simply, the critical pressure is the vapor 
pressure of the liquid at the critical temperature.
Table 9.2 (page 267) lists the critical temperatures of several common substances. 
The species in the column at the left all have critical temperatures below 258C. They are 
often referred to as “permanent gases.” Applying pressure at room temperature will not 
condense a permanent gas. It must be cooled as well. When you see a truck labeled “liq-
uid nitrogen” on the highway, you can be sure that the cargo trailer is refrigerated to at 
least 21478C, the critical temperature of N2.
“Permanent gases” are most often stored and sold in steel cylinders under high pres-
sures, often 150 atm or greater. When the valve on a cylinder of N2 or O2 is opened, gas

escapes, and the pressure drops accordingly. The substances listed in the center column 
of Table 9.2, all of which have critical temperatures above 258C, are handled quite differ-
ently. They are available commercially as liquids in high-pressure cylinders. When the 
valve on a cylinder of propane is opened, the gas that escapes is replaced by vaporization 
of liquid. The pressure quickly returns to its original value. Only when the liquid is com-
pletely vaporized does the pressure drop as gas is withdrawn. This indicates that almost 
all of the propane is gone, and it is time to recharge the tank.
Above the critical temperature and pressure, a substance is referred to as a super-
critical fluid. Such fluids have unusual characteristics. They can diffuse through a solid 
like a gas and dissolve materials like a liquid. Carbon dioxide and water are the most 
commonly used supercritical fluids and hold the promise of many practical new applica-
tions (see Beyond the Classroom at the end of this chapter). 
9.3 Phase Diagrams
In the preceding section, we discussed several features of the equilibrium between a 
liquid and its vapor. For a pure substance, at least two other types of phase equilibria 
need to be considered. One is the equilibrium between a solid and its vapor, the other 
between solid and liquid at the melting (freezing) point. Many of the important relations

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
in all these equilibria can be shown in a phase diagram. A phase diagram is a graph that 
shows the pressures and temperatures at which different phases are in equilibrium with 
each other. The phase diagram of water is shown in Figure 9.6. This figure, which covers 
a wide range of temperatures and pressures, is not drawn to scale. 
To understand what a phase diagram implies, consider first curves b (in green) and 
c (in red) and line a (in blue) in Figure 9.6. Each of these shows the pressures and tem-
peratures at which two adjacent phases are in equilibrium. 
	 1.	 Curve b is a portion of the pressure-temperature curve of liquid water. At any tem-
perature and pressure along this curve, liquid water is in equilibrium with water 
vapor. At point X on the curve, these two phases are in equilibrium at 08C and about 
5 mm Hg (more exactly, 0.018C and 4.56 mm Hg). At point Y corresponding to 
1008C, the pressure exerted by the vapor in equilibrium with liquid water is 1 atm; 
this is the normal boiling point of water. The extension of the curve b beyond point 
Y gives the equilibrium vapor pressure of water above the normal boiling point. The 
extension ends at 3748C, the critical temperature of water, where the pressure is 
218 atm.
	 2.	 Curve c represents the vapor pressure curve of ice. At any point along this curve, 
such as point X (08C, 5 mm Hg) or point Z, which might represent –38C and 3 mm 
Hg, ice and water vapor are in equilibrium with each other. 
	 3.	 Line a gives the temperatures and applied pressures at which liquid water is in equi-
librium with ice. 
The equivalent of point X on any phase diagram is the only one at which all three 
phases, liquid, solid, and vapor, are in equilibrium with each other. It is called the triple 
point. For water, the triple point temperature is 0.018C. At this temperature, liquid water 
and ice have the same vapor pressure, 4.56 mm Hg. 
In the three areas of the phase diagram labeled solid, liquid, and vapor, only one 
phase is present. To understand this, consider what happens to an equilibrium mix-
ture of two phases when the pressure or temperature is changed. Suppose we start at 
the point on the curve b indicated by an open circle. Here liquid water and vapor are 
in equilibrium with each other, let us say at 708C and 234 mm Hg. If the pressure on 
this mixture is increased, condensation occurs. The phase diagram confirms this; 
increasing the pressure at 708C (vertical arrow) puts us in the liquid ­region. In an-
other experiment, the temperature might be increased at a constant pressure. This 
should cause the liquid to vaporize. The phase diagram shows that this is indeed 
what happens. An increase in temperature (horizontal arrow) shifts us to the vapor 
region.

9.3  phase diagrams
Sublimation
The process by which a solid changes directly to vapor without passing through the liq-
uid phase is called sublimation. The opposite of sublimation, the phase transition from 
the vapor phase to solid without passing through the liquid phase, is called deposition. 
The pressure of the solid in equilibrium with the gas is called the vapor pressure of the 
solid (analogous to the vapor pressure of the liquid). A solid can sublime only at tem-
peratures below the triple point; above that temperature it will melt to liquid (Figure 9.6, 
page 268). At temperatures below the triple point, a solid can be made to sublime by 
reducing the pressure of the vapor above it to less than the equilibrium value. To illus-
trate what this means, consider the conditions under which ice sublimes. This happens 
on a cold, dry, winter day when the temperature is below 08C and the pressure of water 
vapor in the air is less than the equilibrium value (4.5 mm Hg at 08C). The rate of subli-
mation can be increased by evacuating the space above the ice. This is how foods are 
freeze-dried. The food is frozen, put into a vacuum chamber, and evacuated to a pressure 
of 1 mm Hg or less. The ice crystals formed on freezing sublime, which leaves a product 
whose mass is only a fraction of that of the original food.
Your freezer can have the conditions necessary for the sublimation of ice or the de-
position of water vapor. Ice cubes left in the freezer after a period of time shrink. Ice 
crystals formed on meat (even in air-tight containers) provide an example of deposition. 
The crystals are a product of the deposition of the water vapor in the meat to ice, leaving 
the meat dehydrated.
Iodine sublimes more readily than ice because its triple-point pressure, 90 mm Hg, 
is much higher. Sublimation occurs on heating (Figure 9.7) below the triple-point tem-
perature, 1148C. If the triple point is exceeded, the solid melts. Solid ­carbon dioxide (dry 
ice) has a triple-point pressure above 1 atm (5.2 atm at 2578C). Liquid ­carbon dioxide 
cannot exist at 1 atm pressure regardless of temperature. Solid CO2 always passes directly 
to vapor if allowed to warm up in an open container.
Melting Point
For a pure substance, the melting point is identical to the freezing point. It represents the 
temperature at which solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium. Melting points are usually 
measured in an open container, that is, at atmospheric pressure. For most substances, the 
melting point at 1 atm (the “normal” melting point) is virtually identical with the triple-
point temperature. For water, the difference is only 0.018C.

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
Although the effect of pressure on melting point is very small, its direction is still im-
portant. To decide whether the melting point will be increased or decreased by compres-
sion, a simple principle is applied. An increase in pressure favors the formation of the more 
dense phase.
Two types of behavior are shown in Figure 9.8.
1.  The solid is the more dense phase (Figure 9.8a). The solid-liquid equilibrium line is 
inclined to the right, shifting away from the y-axis as it rises. At higher pressures, the solid 
becomes stable at temperatures above the normal melting point. In other words, the melt-
ing point is raised by an increase in pressure. This behavior is shown by most substances.
2.  The liquid is the more dense phase (Figure 9.8b). The liquid-solid line is inclined 
to the left, toward the y-axis. An increase in pressure favors the formation of liquid; that 
is, the melting point is decreased by raising the pressure. Water is one of the few sub-
stances that behave this way; ice is less dense than liquid water. The effect is exaggerated 
for emphasis in Figure 9.8b. Actually, an increase in pressure of 134 atm is ­required to 
lower the melting point of ice by 18C.
9.4 Molecular Substances; Intermolecular Forces
Molecules are the characteristic structural units of gases, most liquids, and many solids. 
As a class, molecular substances tend to have the following characteristics.
They are:
1.  Nonconductors of electricity when pure. Molecules are uncharged, so they cannot 
carry an electric current. In most cases (e.g., iodine, I2, and ethyl alcohol, C2H5OH), water 
solutions of molecular substances are also nonconductors. A few polar molecules, including 
HCl, react with water to form ions:
HCl(g) 9: H1(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)
and hence produce a conducting water solution.
2.  Insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar solvents such as CCl4 or benzene. Iodine 
is typical of most molecular substances; it is only slightly soluble in water (0.0013 mol/L at 
258C), much more soluble in benzene (0.48 mol/L). A few molecular substances, including 
ethyl alcohol, are very soluble in water. As you will see later in this section, such substances 
have intermolecular forces similar to those in water.
3.  Low melting and boiling. Many molecular substances are gases at 258C and 1 atm 
(e.g., N2, O2, and CO2), which means that they have boiling points below 258C. Others (such 
as H2O and CCl4) are liquids with melting (freezing) points ­below room temperature. Of the

When the solid is the more

9.4  molecular substances; intermolecular forces
molecular substances that are solids at ordinary temperatures, most are low-melting. For ex-
ample, iodine melts at 1148C; the melting point of naphthalene, used in mothballs, is 808C. 
The upper limit for melting and boiling points of most molecular substances is about 3008C.
The generally low melting and boiling points of molecular substances reflect the fact 
that the forces between molecules (intermolecular forces) are weak. To melt or boil a 
molecular substance, the molecules must be set free from one ­another. This requires only 
that enough energy be supplied to overcome the weak attractive forces between mole-
cules. The strong covalent bonds within molecules remain intact when a molecular sub-
stance melts or boils.
The boiling points of different molecular substances are directly related to the strength 
of the intermolecular forces involved. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher 
the boiling point of the substance. In the remainder of this ­section, we examine the nature 
of the three different types of intermolecular forces: dispersion forces, dipole forces, and hy-
drogen bonds.
Dispersion (London) Forces
The most common type of intermolecular force, found in all molecular substances, is 
referred to as a dispersion force. It is basically electrical in nature, involving an attrac-
tion between temporary or induced dipoles in adjacent molecules. To ­understand the 
origin of dispersion forces, consider Figure 9.9.
On the average, electrons in a nonpolar molecule, such as H2, are as close to one 
nucleus as to the other. However, at a given instant, the electron cloud may be concen-
trated at one end of the molecule (position 1A in Figure 9.9). This momentary concen-
tration of the electron cloud on one side of the molecule creates a temporary dipole in 
H2. One side of the molecule, shown in deeper color in Figure 9.9, acquires a partial 
negative charge; the other side has a partial positive charge of equal magnitude.
This temporary dipole induces a similar dipole (an induced dipole) in an adjacent 
molecule. When the electron cloud in the first molecule is at 1A, the electrons in the 
second molecule are attracted to 2A. These temporary dipoles, both in the same direc-
tion, lead to an attractive force between the molecules. This is the dispersion force.
All molecules have dispersion forces. The strength of these forces depends on two  
factors
•	 the number of electrons in the atoms that make up the molecule.
•	 the ease with which electrons are dispersed to form temporary dipoles.
It’s much easier to separate two 
molecules than to separate two atoms 
within a molecule.

*Strictly speaking, the noble gases are “atomic” rather than molecular. However, like molecules, the noble-gas 
atoms are attracted to one another by dispersion forces.
In nonpolar molecules, dispersion is 
the only intermolecular force.

272
 
chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
Both these factors increase with increasing molecular size. Large molecules are made up 
of more and/or larger atoms. The outer electrons in larger atoms are relatively far from 
the nucleus and are easier to disperse than the electrons in small atoms. In general, mo-
lecular size and molar mass parallel one another. Thus within a given class of substances 
(Table 9.3) we can say that as molar mass ­increases, dispersion forces become stronger 
and the boiling point of nonpolar molecular substances increases.
Dipole Forces
Polar molecules, like nonpolar molecules, are attracted to one another by dispersion 
forces. In addition, they experience dipole forces as illustrated in Figure 9.10, which 
shows the orientation of polar molecules, such as ICl, in a crystal. Adjacent molecules 
line up so that the negative pole of one molecule (small Cl atom) is as close as possible to 
the positive pole (large I atom) of its neighbor. Under these conditions, there is an elec-
trical attractive force, referred to as a dipole force, ­between adjacent polar molecules.
When iodine chloride is heated to 278C, the weak intermolecular forces are unable to 
keep the molecules rigidly aligned, and the solid melts. Dipole forces are still important 
in the liquid state, because the polar molecules remain close to one another. Only in the 
gas, where the molecules are far apart, do the effects of dipole forces become negligible. 
Hence boiling points as well as melting points of polar compounds such as ICl are some-
what higher than those of nonpolar substances of comparable molar mass. This effect is 
shown in Table 9.4.

forces between the d1 of one molecule 
and the d2 of another molecule.
In most molecules, dispersion forces 
are stronger than dipole forces.
Dispersion forces are weak in H2, much 
stronger in I2.

9.4  molecular substances; intermolecular forces
Hydrogen Bonds
Ordinarily, polarity has a relatively small effect on boiling point. In the series HCl : HBr 
: HI, boiling point increases steadily with molar mass, even though polarity decreases 
moving from HCl to HI. However, when hydrogen is bonded to a small, highly electro-
negative atom (N, O, F), polarity has a much greater ­effect on boiling point. Hydrogen 
fluoride, HF, despite its low molar mass (20 g/mol), has the highest boiling point of all 
the hydrogen hal­ides. Water (MM 5 18 g/mol) and ammonia (MM 5 17 g/mol) also 
have abnormally high boiling points (Table 9.5, page 274). In these cases, the effect of 
polarity reverses the normal trend expected from molar mass alone.
The unusually high boiling points of HF, H2O, and NH3 result from an unusually 
strong type of dipole force called a hydrogen bond. The hydrogen bond is a force exerted 
between an H atom bonded to an F, O, or N atom in one molecule and an unshared pair 
on the F, O, or N atom of a neighboring molecule:

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
There are two reasons why hydrogen bonds are stronger than ordinary dipole 
forces:
1.  The difference in electronegativity between hydrogen (2.2) and fluorine (4.0), oxygen 
(3.5), or nitrogen (3.0) is quite large. It causes the bonding electrons in molecules such as HF, 
H2O, and NH3 to be primarily associated with the more electronegative atom (F, O, or N). 
So the hydrogen atom, insofar as its ­interaction with a neighboring molecule is concerned, 
behaves almost like a bare proton.
2.  The small size of the hydrogen atom allows the unshared pair of an F, O, or N atom 
of one molecule to approach the H atom in another very closely. It is significant that hydro-
gen bonding occurs only with these three nonmetals, all of which have small atomic radii.
Hydrogen bonds can exist in many molecules other than HF, H2O, and NH3. The 
basic requirement is simply that hydrogen be bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen 
atom with at least one unshared pair. Consider, for example, the two compounds whose 
condensed structural formulas are
propylamine
CH3CH2CH29N9H
trimethylamine
CH39N9CH3
CH3
H
Propylamine, in which two hydrogen atoms are bonded to nitrogen, can show ­hydrogen 
bonding; it is a liquid with a normal boiling point of 498C. Trimethylamine, which like pro-
pylamine has the molecular formula C3H9N, cannot hydrogen bond to itself; it boils at 38C.

9.4  molecular substances; intermolecular forces
Water has many unusual properties in addition to its high boiling point. As pointed 
out in Chapter 8, it has a very high specific heat, 4.18 J/g · 8C. Its heat of vaporization per 
gram, 2.26 kJ/g, is the highest of all molecular substances. Both of these properties re-
flect the hydrogen-bonded structure of the liquid. Many of these bonds have to be bro-
ken when the liquid is heated; all of them disappear on boiling.
In contrast to most substances, water expands on freezing. Ice is one of the very few 
solids that has a density less than that of the liquid from which it is formed (d ice at 
08C 5 0.917 g/cm3; d water at 08C 5 1.000 g/cm3). This behavior is an indirect ­result of 
hydrogen bonding. When water freezes to ice, an open hexagonal pattern of molecules 
results (Figure 9.11). Each oxygen atom in an ice crystal is bonded to four ­hydrogens. 
Two of these are attached by ordinary covalent bonds at a distance of 0.099 nm. The 
other two form hydrogen bonds 0.177 nm in length. The large proportion of empty space 
in the ice structure explains why ice is less dense than water.

In acetic acid, the H atom bonded to oxygen in one molecule forms a hydrogen bond with an oxygen in an adjacent mole-
cule. The same situation applies in hydrazine if you substitute nitrogen for oxygen.
If ice were more dense than water, 
skating would be a lot less popular.

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
We have now discussed three types of intermolecular forces: dispersion forces, 
dipole forces, and hydrogen bonds. You should bear in mind that all these forces are 
relatively weak compared with ordinary covalent bonds. Consider, for example, the 
situation in H2O. The total intermolecular attractive energy in ice is about 50 kJ/mol. 
In contrast, to dissociate one mole of water vapor into atoms requires the absorption 
of 928 kJ of energy, that is, 2(OH bond energy). This explains why it is a lot easier to 
boil water than to decompose it into the elements. Even at a temperature of 10008C 
and 1 atm, only about one H2O molecule in a billion decomposes to hydrogen and oxy-
gen atoms.

9.5  network covalent, ionic, and metallic solids
9.5 Network Covalent, Ionic, and Metallic Solids
Virtually all substances that are gases or liquids at 258C and 1 atm are molecular. In con-
trast, there are three types of nonmolecular solids (Figure 9.12). These are
•	 network covalent solids, in which atoms are joined by a continuous network of co-
valent bonds. The entire crystal, in effect, consists of one huge molecule.
•	 ionic solids, held together by strong electrical forces (ionic bonds) between ­oppositely 
charged ions adjacent to one another.
•	 metallic solids, in which the structural units are electrons (e2) and cations, which 
may have charges of 11, 12, or 13.
Network Covalent Solids
As a class, network covalent solids
•	 have high melting points, often about 10008C. To melt the solid, covalent bonds be-
tween atoms must be broken. In this respect, solids of this type differ markedly from 
molecular solids, which have much lower melting points.
•	 are insoluble in all common solvents. For solution to occur, covalent bonds through-
out the solid have to be broken.
•	 are poor electrical conductors. In most network covalent substances (graphite is an 
exception), there are no mobile electrons to carry a current.
Graphite and Diamond
Several nonmetallic elements and metalloids have a network covalent structure. The 
most important of these is carbon, which has two different crystalline forms of the net-
work covalent type. Both graphite and diamond have high melting points, above 35008C. 
However, the bonding patterns in the two solids are quite different.
In diamond, each carbon atom forms single bonds with four other carbon atoms 
arranged tetrahedrally around it. The hybridization in diamond is sp3. The three-
dimensional covalent bonding contributes to diamond’s unusual hardness. Diamond 
is one of the hardest substances known; it is used in cutting tools and quality grind-
stones (Figure 9.13, page 278).
Graphite is planar, with the carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern. Each 
carbon atom is bonded to three others, two by single bonds, one by a double bond. The 
hybridization is sp2. The forces between adjacent layers in graphite are of the dispersion 
type and are quite weak. A “lead” pencil really contains a graphite rod, thin layers of 
which rub off onto the paper as you write (Figure 9.14, page 278).
At 258C and 1 atm, graphite is the stable form of carbon. Diamond, in principle, 
should slowly transform to graphite under ordinary conditions. Fortunately for the own-
ers of diamond rings, this transition occurs at zero rate unless the ­diamond is heated to 
about 15008C, at which temperature the conversion occurs rapidly. For understandable 
reasons, no one has ever become very excited over the commercial possibilities of this

process. The more difficult task of converting graphite to diamond has aroused much 
greater enthusiasm.
At high pressures, diamond is the stable form of carbon, since it has a higher density 
than graphite (3.51 vs 2.26 g/cm3). The industrial synthesis of diamond from graphite or 
other forms of carbon is carried out at about 100,000 atm and 20008C.
Compounds of Silicon
Perhaps the simplest compound with a network covalent structure is quartz, the most 
common form of SiO2 and the major component of sand. In quartz, each ­silicon atom 
bonds tetrahedrally to four oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom bonds to two silicons, thus 
linking adjacent tetrahedra to one another (Figure 9.15, page 279). ­Notice that the net-
work of covalent bonds extends throughout the entire crystal. Unlike most pure solids, 
quartz does not melt sharply to a liquid. Instead, it turns to a viscous mass over a wide 
temperature range, first softening at about 14008C. The viscous fluid probably contains 
long 9 Si 9 O 9 Si 9 O 9 chains, with enough bonds broken to allow flow.
More than 90% of the rocks and minerals found in the earth’s crust are silicates, which 
are essentially ionic. Typically the anion has a network covalent structure in which SiO442 
tetrahedra are bonded to one another in one, two, or three dimensions. The structure 
shown at the left of Figure 9.16 (page 279), where the anion is a one-dimensional infinite 
chain, is typical of fibrous minerals such as diopside, CaSiO3?MgSiO3. Asbestos has a re-
lated structure in which two chains are linked ­together to form a double strand.
The structure shown at the right of Figure 9.16 (page 279) is typical of layer minerals 
such as talc, Mg3(OH)2Si4O10. Here SiO442 tetrahedra are linked together to form an in-
finite sheet. The layers are held loosely together by weak dispersion forces, so they easily 
slide past one another. As a result, talcum powder, like graphite, has a slippery feeling.
Among the three-dimensional silicates are the zeolites, which contain cavities or 
tunnels in which Na1 or Ca21 ions may be trapped. Synthetic zeolites with made-to-
order holes are used in home water softeners. When hard water con­taining Ca21 ions

flows through a zeolite column, an exchange reaction occurs. If we represent the formula 
of the zeolite as NaZ, where Z2 represents a complex, three-dimensional anion, the wa-
ter-softening reaction can be represented by the equation
Ca21(aq) 1 2NaZ(s) 9: CaZ2(s) 1 2Na1(aq)
Sodium ions migrate out of the cavities; Ca21 ions from the hard water move in to re-
place them.
Ionic Solids
An ionic solid consists of cations and anions (e.g., Na1, Cl2). No simple, discrete mole-
cules are present in NaCl or other ionic compounds; rather, the ions are held in a regular, 
repeating arrangement by strong ionic bonds, electrostatic interactions between oppo-
sitely charged ions. Because of this structure, shown in Figure 9.12 (page 277), ionic 
solids have the following properties:
1.  Ionic solids are nonvolatile and have high-melting points (typically from 6008C to 
20008C). Ionic bonds must be broken to melt the solid, separating oppositely charged ions 
from each other. Only at high temperatures do the ions acquire enough kinetic energy for 
this to happen.
2.  Ionic solids do not conduct electricity because the charged ions are fixed in position. 
They become good conductors, however, when melted or dissolved in water. In both cases, 
in the melt or solution, the ions (such as Na1 and Cl2) are free to move through the liquid 
and thus can conduct an electric current.
3.  Many, but not all, ionic compounds (e.g., NaCl but not CaCO3) are ­soluble in water, 
a polar solvent. In contrast, ionic compounds are insoluble in nonpolar solvents such as 
benzene (C6H6) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).

chapter nine  Liquids and Solids
The relative strengths of different ionic bonds can be estimated from Coulomb’s law, 
which gives the electrical energy of interaction between a cation and anion in contact 
with one another:
E 5 k 3 Q1 3 Q2
d
Here, Q1 and Q2 are the charges of anion and cation, and d, the distance between the 
centers of the two ions, is the sum of the ionic radii (Appendix 2):
d 5 rcation 1 ranion
The quantity k is a constant whose magnitude need not concern us. Because the cation 
and anion have opposite charges, E is a negative quantity. This makes sense; energy is 
evolved when two oppositely charged ions, originally far apart with E 5 0, approach one 
another closely. Conversely, energy has to be absorbed to separate the ions from each 
other.
From Coulomb’s law, the strength of the ionic bond should depend on two factors:
1.  The charges of the ions. The bond in CaO (12, 22 ions) is considerably stronger 
than that in NaCl (11, 21 ions). This explains why the melting point of calcium oxide 
(29278C) is so much higher than that of sodium chloride (8018C).
2.  The size of the ions. The ionic bond in NaCl (mp 5 8018C) is somewhat stronger 
than that in KBr (mp 5 7348C) because the internuclear distance is smaller in NaCl:
dNaCl 5 rNa1 1 rCl2 5 0.095 nm 1 0.181 nm 5 0.276 nm
dKBr 5 rK1 1 rBr2 5 0.133 nm 1 0.195 nm 5 0.328 nm
Metals
Figure 9.12d (page 277) illustrates a simple model of bonding in metals known as the 
electron-sea model. The metallic crystal is pictured as an array of positive ions, for ex-
ample, Na1, Mg21. These are anchored in position, like buoys in a mobile “sea” of elec-
trons. These electrons are not attached to any particular positive ion but rather can wan-
der through the crystal. The electron-sea model explains many of the characteristic 
properties of metals:
1.  High electrical conductivity. The presence of large numbers of relatively mobile elec-
trons explains why metals have electrical conductivities several hundred times greater than 
those of typical nonmetals. Silver is the best electrical conductor but is too expensive for 
general use. Copper, with a conductivity close to that of silver, is the metal most commonly 
used for electrical wiring. Although a much poorer conductor than copper, mercury is used 
in many electrical devices, such as silent light switches, in which a liquid conductor is 
required.
A more sophisticated model of metals 
is described in Appendix 4.

9.5  network covalent, ionic, and metallic solids
2.  High thermal conductivity. Heat is carried through metals by collisions ­between 
electrons, which occur frequently. Saucepans used for cooking commonly contain alumi-
num, copper, or stainless steel; their handles are made of a nonmetallic material that is a 
good thermal insulator.
3.  Ductility and malleability. Most metals are ductile (capable of being drawn out into 
a wire) and malleable (capable of being hammered into thin sheets). In a metal, the electrons 
act like a flexible glue holding the atomic ­nuclei ­together. As a result, metal crystals can be 
deformed without shattering.
4.  Luster. Polished metal surfaces reflect light. Most metals have a silvery white metallic 
color because they reflect light of all wavelengths. Because electrons are not restricted to a 
particular bond, they can absorb and re-emit light over a wide wavelength range. Gold and 
copper absorb some light in the blue region of the visible spectrum and so appear yellow 
(gold) or red (copper).
5.  Insolubility in water and other common solvents. No metals dissolve in water; elec-
trons cannot go into solution, and cations cannot dissolve by themselves. The only liquid 
metal, mercury, dissolves many metals, forming solutions called amalgams. An Ag-Sn-Hg 
amalgam is still used in filling teeth.
In general, the melting points of metals cover a wide range, from 2398C for mercury 
to 34108C for tungsten. This variation in melting point corresponds to a similar variation 
in the strength of the metallic bond. Generally speaking, the lowest melting metals are 
those that form 11 cations, like sodium (mp 5 988C) and potassium (mp 5 648C).
Much of what has been said about the four structural types of solids in Sections 9.4 
and 9.5 is summarized in Table 9.6.

9.6 Crystal Structures
Solids tend to crystallize in definite geometric forms that often can be seen by the naked 
eye. In ordinary table salt, cubic crystals of NaCl are clearly visible. Large, beautifully 
formed crystals of such minerals as fluorite, CaF2, are found in nature. It is possible to 
observe distinct crystal forms of many metals under a microscope.
Crystals have definite geometric forms because the atoms or ions present are ar-
ranged in a definite, three-dimensional pattern. The nature of this pattern can be de-
duced by a technique known as x-ray diffraction. The basic information that comes out 
of such studies has to do with the dimensions and geometric form of the unit cell, the 
smallest structural unit that, repeated over and over again in three dimensions, generates 
the crystal. In all, there are 14 different kinds of unit cells. Our discussion will be limited 
to a few of the simpler unit cells found in metals and ionic solids.
Metals
Three of the simpler unit cells found in metals, shown in Figure 9.17 (page 283), are the 
­following:
1.  Simple cubic cell (SC). This is a cube that consists of eight atoms whose centers are 
located at the corners of the cell. Atoms at adjacent corners of the cube touch one another.
2.  Face-centered cubic cell (FCC). Here, there is an atom at each corner of the cube and one 
in the center of each of the six faces of the cube. In this structure, atoms at the corners of the cube 
do not touch one another; they are forced slightly apart. Instead, contact occurs along a face di-
agonal. The atom at the center of each face touches atoms at opposite corners of the face.

3.  Body-centered cubic cell (BCC). This is a cube with atoms at each ­corner and one in 
the center of the cube. Here again, corner atoms do not touch each other. Instead, contact 
occurs along the body diagonal; the atom at the ­center of the cube touches atoms at opposite 
corners.
Table 9.7 lists three other ways in which these types of cubic cells differ from one 
another.
1.  Number of atoms per unit cell. Keep in mind that a huge number of unit cells are in 
contact with each other, interlocking to form a three-dimensional crystal. This means that 
several of the atoms in a unit cell do not belong exclusively to that cell. Specifically
•	 an atom at the corner of a cube forms a part of eight different cubes that touch at that 
point. (To convince yourself of this, look back at Figure 2.12 (page 44); focus on the small 
sphere in the center.) In this sense, only 1
8 of a corner atom belongs to a particular cell.
•	 an atom at the center of the face of a cube is shared by another cube that touches that 
face. In effect, only 1
2 of that atom can be assigned to a given cell. This means, for ex-
ample, that the number of atoms per FCC unit cell is
(8 corner atoms 3 1
8) 1 (6 face atoms 3 1
2) 5 4 atoms per cube
2.  Relation between side of cell (s) and atomic radius (r). To see how these two quanti-
ties are related, consider an FCC cell in which atoms touch along a face diagonal. As you can 
see from Figure 9.18
•	 the distance along the face diagonal, d, is equal to four atomic radii

9.6  crystal structures
3.  Percentage of empty space. Metal atoms in a crystal, like marbles in a box, tend to 
pack closely together. As you can see from Table 9.7, nearly half of a simple ­cubic unit cell is 
empty space. This makes the SC structure very unstable; only one metal (polonium, Z 5 84) 
has this type of unit cell. The body-centered ­cubic structure has less waste space; about 
20 metals, including all those in Group 1, have a BCC unit cell. A still more efficient way of 
packing spheres of the same size is the face-centered cubic structure, where the fraction of 
empty space is only 0.26. About 40 different metals have a structure based on a face-centered 
cubic cell or a close relative in which the packing is equally efficient (hexagonal closest 
packed structure).

2. The calculated density in part (c) assumes no empty space. If empty space is factored in, [(0.26)(14.3) 5 3.7], then 
3.7 g/cm3 has to be subtracted from the density obtained in part (c). The calculated density is therefore [14.3 2 3.7] 5 
10.6 g/cm3. The experimentally obtained value is 10.5 g/cm3.

Ionic Crystals
Th e geometry of ionic crystals, in which there are two diff erent kinds of ions, is more 
diffi  cult to describe than that of metals. However, in many cases the packing can be vi-
sualized in terms of the unit cells described above. Lithium chloride, LiCl, is a case in 
point. Here, the larger Cl2 ions form a face-centered cubic lattice (Figure 9.19, page 287). 
Th e smaller Li1 ions fi t into “holes” between the Cl2 ions. Th is puts a Li1 ion at the cen-
ter of each edge of the cube.
The crystal structures discussed in this 
section were determined by a powerful 
technique known as x-ray diff raction (Figure 
A). By studying the pattern produced when 
the scattered rays strike a target, it is possi-
ble to deduce the geometry of the unit cell. 
With molecular crystals, one can go a step 
further, identifying the geometry and com-
position of the molecule. A father and son 
team of two english physicists, William H. 
(1862–1942) and William l. Bragg (1890–
1971), won the Nobel Prize in 1915 for 
pioneer work in this area.
The Braggs and their successors strongly 
sought out talented women scientists to 
develop the new fi eld of x-ray crystallogra-
phy. Foremost among these women was 
dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, who spent 
almost all of her professional career at oxford 
University in england. As the years passed 
she unraveled the structures of successively 
more complex natural products. These in-
cluded penicillin, which she studied between 
1942 and 1949, vitamin B-12 (1948–1957), 
and her greatest triumph, insulin, which she 
worked on for more than 30 years. Among 
her students at oxford was margaret 
Thatcher, the future prime minister. In 1964, 
dorothy Hodgkin became the third woman 
to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The fi rst 
two women Nobel laureates in Chemistry 
were marie Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie. 
Forty-fi ve years later (in 2009), a fourth 
woman, Ada yonath, an Israeli crystallogra-
pher, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Hodgkin’s accomplishments were all 
the more remarkable when you consider 
some of the obstacles she had to over-
come. At the age of 24, she developed 
rheumatoid arthritis, a crippling disease of 
the immune system. gradually she lost the 
use of her hands; ultimately she was con-
fi ned to a wheelchair. dorothy Hodgkin 
succeeded because she combined a fi rst-
rate intellect with an almost infi nite capac-
ity for hard work. Beyond that, she was 
one of those rare individuals who inspire 
loyalty by taking genuine pleasure in the 
successes of other people. A colleague re-
ferred to her as “the gentle genius.”
dorothy’s husband, Thomas Hodgkin, 
was a scholar in his own right with an 
 interest in the history of Africa. Apparently 
realizing that hers was the greater talent, 
he acted as a “house-husband” for their 
three children so she would have more 
time to  devote to research. one wonders 
how dorothy and Thomas Hodgkin reacted 
to the 1964 headline in a london tabloid, 
“British Wife Wins Nobel Prize.”

9.6  crystal structures
In the sodium chloride crystal, the Na1 ion is slightly too large to fit into holes in a 
face-centered lattice of Cl2 ions (Figure 9.19). As a result, the Cl2 ions are pushed slightly 
apart so that they are no longer touching, and only Na1 ions are in contact with Cl2 ions. 
However, the relative positions of positive and negative ions remain the same as in LiCl: 
Each anion is surrounded by six cations and each cation by six anions.
The structures of LiCl and NaCl are typical of all the alkali halides (Group 1 cation, 
Group 17 anion) except those of cesium. Because of the large size of the Cs1 ion, 
CsCl crystallizes in a quite different structure. Here, each Cs1 ion is ­located at the cen-
ter of a simple cube outlined by Cl2 ions. The Cs1 ion at the center touches all the Cl2 
ions at the corners; the Cl2 ions do not touch each other. As you can see, each Cs1 ion 
is surrounded by eight Cl2 ions, and each Cl2 ion is surrounded by eight Cs1 ions.
NaCl is FCC in both Na1 and Cl2 ions; 
CsCl is BCC in both Cs1 and Cl2 ions.

Supercritical Carbon Dioxide 
Carbon dioxide has been in the news recently because of its pos-
sible contribution to global climate change. However, supercritical 
carbon dioxide has found many practical applications. It is the su-
percritical fl uid most extensively studied because it is cheap, non-
toxic, and relatively easy to bring to supercritical status. 
Carbon dioxide usually behaves as a gas in air or as a solid called 
dry ice when it is frozen. It behaves as a supercritical fl uid above its 
critical temperature (31°C) and critical pressure (73 atm). As a su-
percritical fl uid it expands to fi ll its container like a gas but it has a 
density like that of a liquid (Figure A). 
Caff eine used to be extracted using the solvent dichlorometh-
ane (CH2Cl2). Unfortunately, dichloromethane was suspected to 
be a carcinogen so a diff erent solvent had to be found. more than 
20 years ago, supercritical Co2 was tried as an alternative method 
for the extraction of caff eine from coff ee beans. It was forced 
through the green coff ee beans and the infused beans were then 
sprayed under high pressure with water to remove the dissolved 
caff eine. The caff eine was isolated by passing the water through 
activated charcoal fi lters, or by distillation (Chapter 1), crystalliza-
tion, or reverse osmosis (Chapter 10). The recovered caff eine was 
then sold mostly to beverage manufacturers and pharmaceutical 
companies. This process was so eff ective that most of the coff ee 
sold today is decaff einated by this process (Figure B). 
CHemISTry beYond the claSSrooM
The dry cleaning industry now has several pilot plants using su-
percritical Co2 as a solvent for removing oils, stains, and grime 
from clothes that cannot be washed in water. The industry is trying 
to replace the more commonly used solvent, perchloroethylene 
(PerC), which has been linked to liver and kidney damage in people 
working in dry cleaning plants and in people in urban areas who live 
near these plants. Supercritical Co2 has one drawback, however. It 
does not dissolve many of the proteins in food stains, waxes, and 
salts because of its nonpolar nature. research is now ongoing to 
fi nd detergents that will enhance carbon dioxide’s eff ectivity in 
stain removal. Several polymer detergents look promising. 
A decade ago, a study by a team of researchers from the mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology reported the use of supercriti-
cal Co2 to deactivate live bacteria. medical research is now engaged 
in the study of supercritical Co2 as an alternative option for tissue 
transplant sterilization. It is particularly attractive for sterilizing 
bone and tendon fragments used for torn ACls (anterior cruciate 
ligaments) or spinal fusions. These fragments are typically steril-
ized by irradiation or by treatment with steam. These treatments 
are often found to compromise the strength of the fragments by 
degrading the collagen, making them unusable for grafts. 
other projects involving supercritical Co2, to name a few, are 
the extraction of cholesterol from meat, fat from potato chips, and 
nicotine from tobacco. Supercritical Co2 heat pumps are now mar-
keted in Asia using Co2 as a natural refrigerant. 
many scientists are very excited at the prospects of fi nding more 
uses for this novel compound. Ironically, its supercritical phase may 
redeem it from the bad press that gaseous Co2 has received lately.

n the course of a day, you use or make solutions many times. Your morning cup of coffee is 
a solution of solids (sugar and coffee) in a liquid (water). The gasoline you fill your gas tank 
with is a solution of several different liquid hydrocarbons. The soda you drink at a study 
break is a solution containing a gas (carbon dioxide) in a liquid (water).
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute (substance being dissolved) distrib-
uted through a solvent (substance doing the dissolving). Solutions exist in any of the three 
physical states: gas, liquid, or solid. Air, the most common gaseous solution, is a mixture of 
nitrogen, oxygen, and lesser amounts of other gases. Many metal alloys are solid solutions. 
An example is the U.S. “nickel” coin (25% Ni, 75% Cu). The most familiar solutions are those 
in the liquid state, especially ones in which water is the solvent. Aqueous solutions are most 
important for our purposes in chemistry and will be emphasized in this chapter.
This chapter covers several of the physical aspects of solutions, including
• methods of expressing solution concentrations by specifying the relative amounts of 
solute and solvent (Section 10.1).
• factors affecting solubility, including the nature of the solute and the solvent, the 
temperature, and the pressure (Section 10.2).
• the effect of solutes on such solvent properties as vapor pressure, freezing point, and 
boiling point (Sections 10.3, 10.4).

chapter TEN  Solutions
10.1 Concentration Units
Several different methods are used to express relative amounts of solute and solvent in a 
solution. Two concentration units, molarity and mole fraction, were referred to in pre-
vious chapters. Two others, mass percent and molality, are considered for the first time.
Molarity (M)
In Chapter 4, molarity was the concentration unit of choice in dealing with solution 
stoichiometry. You will recall that molarity is defined as
molarity (M) 5  moles solute
liters solution
A solution can be prepared to a specified molarity by weighing out the calculated 
mass of solute and dissolving in enough solvent to form the desired volume of solution. 
Alternatively, you can start with a more concentrated solution and dilute with water to 
give a solution of the desired molarity (Figure 10.1). The calculations are straightforward 
if you keep a simple point in mind: Adding solvent cannot change the number of moles of 
solute. That is,
nsolute (concentrated solution) 5 nsolute (dilute solution)
In both solutions, n can be found by multiplying the molarity, M, by the volume in liters, 
V. Hence
 
McVc 5 MdVd	
(10.1)
where the subscripts c and d stand for concentrated and dilute solutions, respectively.
The advantage of preparing solutions by the method illustrated in Figure 10.1 is that 
only volume measurements are necessary. If you wander into the general chemistry 
storeroom, you’re likely to find concentrated “stock” solutions of various chemicals. 
Storeroom personnel prepare the more dilute solutions that you use in the laboratory on 
the basis of calculations like those in the following example.
It’s easier to dilute a concentrated 
solution than to start from “scratch.”

Finally, water is carefully added to bring

The molarity of the CuSO4 stock solution (1.000 M) is 10 times what you need (0.1000 M), so it is reasonable to use only one

1. Multiplying the mol fraction of H2O2 by 100% gives the mol percent of H2O2 in the solution (11.7%).
2. Notice that the mole percent (11.7) is considerably less than the mass percent (20.0) of H2O2 in solution. That is because 
the molar mass of H2O2 is larger than that of H2O.

For very dilute aqueous solutions, 1 ppm is approximately equivalent to 1 mg/L. This

Conversions Between Concentration Units
It is frequently necessary to convert from one concentration unit to another. This problem 
arises, for example, in making up solutions of hydrochloric acid. Typically, the analysis or 
assay that appears on the label (Figure 10.2, page 301) does not give the molarity or molality 
of the acid. Instead, it lists the mass percent of solute and the density of the solution.
Conversions between concentration units are relatively straightforward provided you 
first decide on a fixed amount of solution. The amount chosen depends on the unit in which 
concentration is originally expressed. Some suggested starting quantities are listed below.

Theoretically, you would also need to calculate the mass of Cl2 ions and add that to the mass of Na1, glucose, and water. 
Practically, the mass of Cl2 ions (like the mass of Na1 ions) is negligible when compared with the mass of the solution.
Complex problems can usually be 
solved if you know where to start.

Here is an illustration of how you can fill in and use the table. Suppose that you want 
to find the molality (m) of a solution X (MM 5 100.0 g/mol) that is 1.35 M and has a 
density of 1.28 g/mL. The given concentration unit is molarity. Recall the definition of 
molarity (1.35 moles solute in 1000 mL of solution) and fill in the table accordingly. The 
concentration unit asked for is molality (moles solute in 1 kg of solvent). The table shown 
below has the given data filled in the appropriate spaces and the spots needed for the

You can calculate the mass of the solvent if you know the mass of the solution and the 
mass of the solute. Since the density and the volume of the solution are known, the mass of 
the solution is 1280 g [(1.28 g/mL)(1000 mL)]. The mass of the solute is 135 g [(1.35 mol)
(100.0 g/mol)]. Thus the mass of the solvent is 1145 g (1280 g 2 135 g) or 1.145 kg.

10.2 Principles of Solubility
The extent to which a solute dissolves in a particular solvent depends on several factors. 
The most important of these are
•	 the nature of solvent and solute particles and the interactions between them.
•	 the temperature at which the solution is formed.
•	 the pressure of a gaseous solute.
In this section we consider in turn the effect of each of these factors on solubility.
Solute-Solvent Interactions
In discussing solubility, it is sometimes stated that “like dissolves like.” A more meaning-
ful way to express this idea is to say that two substances with intermolecular forces of 
about the same type and magnitude are likely to be very soluble in one another. To il-
lustrate, consider the hydrocarbons pentane, C5H12, and hexane, C6H14, which are com-
pletely soluble in each other. Molecules of these nonpolar substances are held together 
by dispersion forces of about the same magnitude. A pentane molecule experiences little 
or no change in intermolecular forces when it goes into solution in hexane.
Most nonpolar substances have very small water solubilities. Petroleum, a mixture 
of hydrocarbons, spreads out in a thin film on the surface of a body of water rather than 
dissolving. The mole fraction of pentane, C5H12, in a saturated water solution is only 
0.0001. These low solubilities are readily understood in terms of the structure of liquid 
water, which you will recall (Chapter 9) is strongly hydrogen-bonded. Dissimilar inter-
molecular forces between C5H12 (dispersion) and H2O (H bonds) lead to low solubility.
Of the relatively few organic compounds that dissolve readily in water, many con-
tain ! OH groups. Three familiar examples are methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and ethyl-
ene glycol, all of which are infinitely soluble in water.

In these compounds, as in water, the principal intermolecular forces are hydrogen bonds. 
When a substance like methyl alcohol dissolves in water, it forms hydrogen bonds with 
H2O molecules. These hydrogen bonds, joining a CH3OH molecule to an H2O molecule, 
are about as strong as those in the pure substances.
Not all organic compounds that contain ! OH groups are soluble in water 
(Table 10.1). As molar mass increases, the polar ! OH group represents an increasingly 
smaller portion of the molecule. At the same time, the nonpolar hydrocarbon portion 
becomes larger. As a result, solubility decreases with increasing molar mass. Butanol,

10.2  principles of solubility
CH3CH2CH2CH2OH, is much less soluble in water than methyl alcohol, CH3OH. The 
hydrocarbon portion, shaded in green, is much larger in butanol.
The solubility (or insolubility) of different vitamins is of concern in nutrition. Mol-
ecules of vitamins B and C contain several ! OH groups that can form hydrogen bonds 
with water (Figure 10.3). As a result, they are water-soluble, readily excreted by the body, 
and must be consumed daily. In contrast, vitamins A, D, E, and K, whose molecules are 
relatively nonpolar, are water-insoluble. These vitamins are not so readily excreted; they 
tend to stay behind in fatty tissues. This means that the body can draw on its reservoir of 
vitamins A, D, E, and K to deal with sporadic deficiencies. Conversely, megadoses of 
these vitamins can lead to very high, possibly toxic, concentrations in the body.
As we noted in Chapter 4, the solubility of ionic compounds in water varies tremen-
dously from one solid to another. The extent to which solution occurs depends on a 
balance between two forces, both electrical in nature:
	 1.	 The force of attraction between H2O molecules and the ions, which tends to bring 
the solid into solution. If this factor predominates, the compound is very soluble in 
water, as is the case with NaCl, NaOH, and many other ionic solids.
 2. The force of attraction between oppositely charged ions, which tends to keep them in 
the solid state. If this is the major factor, the water solubility is very low. The fact that 
CaCO3 and BaSO4 are almost insoluble in water implies that interionic attractive forces 
predominate with these ionic solids.
Effect of Temperature on Solubility
When an excess of a solid such as sodium nitrate, NaNO3, is shaken with water, an equi-
librium is established between ions in the solid state and in solution:
NaNO3(s) 9: Na1(aq) 1 NO32(aq)
At 208C, the saturated solution contains 87.6 g of NaNO3 per one hundred grams of 
water.
A similar type of equilibrium is established when a gas such as oxygen is bubbled 
through water.
O2(g) EF O2(aq)
At 208C and 1 atm, 0.00138 mol of O2 dissolves per liter of water.
The effect of a temperature change on solubility equilibria such as these can be pre-
dicted by applying a simple principle. An increase in temperature always shifts the posi-

tion of an equilibrium to favor an endothermic process. This means that if the solution 
process absorbs heat (DHsoln. . 0), an increase in temperature increases the solubility. 
Conversely, if the solution process is exothermic (DHsoln. , 0), an increase in tempera-
ture decreases the solubility.
Dissolving a solid in a liquid is usually an endothermic process; heat must be ab-
sorbed to break down the crystal lattice.

For example, for sodium nitrate,
DHsoln. 5 DHf8 Na1(aq) 1 DHf8 NO32(aq) 2 DHf8 NaNO3(s) 5 122.8 kJ
Consistent with this effect, the solubility of NaNO3 and most (but not all) other solids 
increases with temperature (Figure 10.4).
Gases behave quite differently from solids. When a gas condenses to a liquid, heat is 
always evolved. By the same token, heat is usually evolved when a gas dissolves in a 
liquid:
gas 1 liquid EF solution        DHsoln. , 0
This means that the reverse process (gas coming out of solution) is endothermic. Hence, 
it is favored by an increase in temperature; typically, gases become less soluble as the 
temperature rises. This rule is followed by all gases in water. You have probably noticed 
this effect when opening carbonated drinks (Figure 10.5). Cold drinks produce fewer 
bubbles than warm drinks because carbon dioxide is less soluble at higher temperature. 
For the same reason, warm carbonated beverages go flat faster than cold ones. You have 
probably noticed this effect when heating water in an open pan or beaker. Bubbles of air 
are driven out of the water by an increase in temperature. The reduced solubility of oxy-
gen in water at high temperatures (Figure 10.6a, page 307) may explain why trout con-
gregate at the bottom of deep pools on hot summer days when the surface water is de-
pleted of dissolved oxygen.

10.2  principles of solubility
Effect of Pressure on Solubility
Pressure has a major effect on solubility only for gas-liquid systems. At a given tempera-
ture, raising the pressure increases the solubility Cg, of a gas. Indeed, at low to moderate 
pressures, gas solubility is directly proportional to pressure (Figure 10.6b).
 
Cg 5 kPg	
(10.2)
where Pg is the partial pressure of the gas over the solution, Cg is its concentration in the 
solution, and k is a constant characteristic of the particular gas-liquid system. This rela-
tion is called Henry’s law after its discoverer, William Henry (1775–1836), a friend of John 
Dalton.
Henry’s law arises because increasing the pressure raises the concentration of mol-
ecules in the gas phase. To balance this change and maintain equilibrium, more gas mol-
ecules enter the solution, increasing their concentration in the liquid phase (Figure 10.7).

chapter TEN  Solutions
The influence of partial pressure on gas solubility is used in making carbonated 
beverages such as beer, sparkling wines, and many soft drinks. These beverages are bot-
tled under pressures of CO2 as high as 4 atm. When the bottle or can is opened, the pres-
sure above the liquid drops to 1 atm, and the carbon dioxide rapidly bubbles out of solu-
tion. Pressurized containers for shaving cream, whipped cream, and cheese spreads 
work on a similar principle. Pressing a valve reduces the pressure on the dissolved gas, 
causing it to rush from solution, carrying liquid with it as a foam.
Another consequence of the effect of pressure on gas solubility is the painful, some-
times fatal, affliction known as the “bends.” This occurs when a person goes rapidly from 
deep water (high pressure) to the surface (lower pressure), where gases are less soluble. 
The rapid decompression causes air, dissolved in blood and other body fluids, to bubble 
out of solution. These bubbles impair blood circulation and affect nerve impulses. To 
minimize these effects, deep-sea divers and aquanauts breathe a helium-oxygen mixture 
rather than compressed air (nitrogen-oxygen). Helium is only about one-third as soluble 
as nitrogen, and hence much less gas comes out of solution on decompression.
10.3 Colligative Properties of Nonelectrolytes
The properties of a solution differ considerably from those of the pure solvent. Those 
solution properties that depend primarily on the concentration of solute particles rather 
than their nature are called colligative properties. Such properties include vapor pres-
sure lowering, osmotic pressure, boiling point elevation, and freezing point depression. 
This section considers the relations between colligative properties and solute concentra-
tion, with nonelectrolytes that exist in solution as molecules.
The relationships among colligative properties and solute concentration are best re-

dilute. In practice, the relationships discussed in this section are valid, for nonelectro-
lytes, to within a few percent at concentrations as high as 1 M. At higher concentrations, 
solute-solute interactions lead to larger deviations.

10.3  colligative properties of nonelectrolytes
Vapor Pressure Lowering
You may have noticed that concentrated aqueous solutions evaporate more slowly than 
does pure water. This reflects the fact that the vapor pressure of water over the solution 
is less than that of pure water (Figure 10.8).
Vapor pressure lowering is a true colligative property; that is, it is independent of 
the nature of the solute but directly proportional to its concentration. For example, the 
vapor pressure of water above a 0.10 M solution of either glucose or sucrose at 08C is the 
same, about 0.008 mm Hg less than that of pure water. In a 0.30 M solution, the vapor 
pressure lowering is almost exactly three times as great, 0.025 mm Hg.
The relationship between solvent vapor pressure and concentration is ordinarily ex-
pressed as
 
P1 5 X1P18	
(10.3)
In this equation, P1 is the vapor pressure of solvent over the solution, P18 is the vapor 
pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature, and X1 is the mole fraction of sol-
vent. Note that because X1 in a solution must be less than 1, P1 must be less than P18. This 
relationship is called Raoult’s law; François Raoult (1830–1901) carried out a large num-
ber of careful experiments on vapor pressures and freezing point lowering.
To obtain a direct expression for vapor pressure lowering, note that X1 5 1 2 X2, 
where X2 is the mole fraction of solute. Substituting 1 2 X2 for X1 in Raoult’s law,
P1 5 (1 2 X2) P18
Rearranging,
P18 2 P1 5 X2P18
The quantity (P18 2 P1) is the vapor pressure lowering (DP). It is the difference between 
the solvent vapor pressure in the pure solvent and in solution.

Vapor pressure lowering is directly 
proportional to solute mole fraction.

Boiling Point Elevation and Freezing Point Lowering
When a solution of a nonvolatile solute is heated, it does not begin to boil until the tem-
perature exceeds the boiling point of the solvent. The difference in temperature is called 
the boiling point elevation, DTb.
DTb 5 Tb 2 Tb8
where Tb and Tb8 are the boiling points of the solution and the pure solvent, respectively. 
As boiling continues, pure solvent distills off, the concentration of solute increases, and 
the boiling point continues to rise (Figure 10.9, page 311).
When a solution is cooled, it does not begin to freeze until a temperature below the 
freezing point of the pure solvent is reached. The freezing point lowering, DTf, is de-
fined to be a positive quantity:
DTf 5 Tf8  2 Tf
where Tf8, the freezing point of the solvent, lies above Tf, the freezing point of the solu-
tion. As freezing takes place, pure solvent freezes out, the concentration of solute in-

creases, and the freezing point continues to drop. This is what happens with “ice beer.” 
When beer is cooled below 08C, pure ice separates and the percentage of ethyl alcohol 
increases.
Boiling point elevation is a direct result of vapor pressure lowering. At any given 
temperature, a solution of a nonvolatile solute* has a vapor pressure lower than that of 
the pure solvent. Hence a higher temperature must be reached before the solution boils, 
that is, before its vapor pressure becomes equal to the external pressure. Figure 10.10 il-
lustrates this reasoning graphically.
The freezing point lowering, like the boiling point elevation, is a direct result of the 
lowering of the solvent vapor pressure by the solute. Notice from Figure 10.10 that  
the freezing point of the solution is the temperature at which the solvent in solution has 
the same vapor pressure as the pure solid solvent. This implies that it is pure solvent (e.g., 
ice) that separates when the solution freezes.
Boiling point elevation and freezing point lowering, like vapor pressure lowering, 
are colligative properties. They are directly proportional to solute concentration, gener-
ally expressed as molality, m. The relevant equations are
DTb 5 kb (molality)
DTf 5 kf (molality)
The proportionality constants in these equations, kb and kf, are called the molal boiling 
point constant and the molal freezing point constant, respectively. Their magnitudes depend 
on the nature of the solvent (Table 10.2, page 313). Note that when the solvent is water,

chapter TEN  Solutions
You take advantage of freezing point lowering when you add antifreeze to your auto-
mobile radiator in winter. Ethylene glycol, HO(CH2)2OH, is the solute commonly used. It 
has a high boiling point (1978C), is virtually nonvolatile at 1008C, and raises the boiling 
point of water. Hence antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol does not boil away in sum-
mer driving.
Propylene glycol, HO ! (CH2)3 ! OH, is 
much less toxic.

An antifreeze solution is prepared containing 50.0 cm3 of ethylene glycol, C2H6O2 (d 5 1.12 g/cm3), in 50.0 g of water.

10.3  colligative properties of nonelectrolytes
Osmotic Pressure
One interesting effect of vapor pressure lowering is shown at the left of Figure 10.11. We 
start with two beakers, one containing pure water and the other containing a sugar solu-
tion. These are placed next to each other under a bell jar (Figure 10.11a). As time passes, 
the liquid level in the beaker containing the solution rises. The level of pure water in the 
other beaker falls. Eventually, by evaporation and condensation, all the water is trans-
ferred to the solution (Figure 10.11b). At the end of the experiment, the beaker that con-
tained pure water is empty. The driving force behind this process is the difference in va-
por pressure of water in the two beakers. Water moves from a region where its vapor 
pressure or mole fraction is high (X1 5 1 in pure water) to one in which its vapor pressure 
or mole fraction is lower (X1 , 1 in sugar solution).
The apparatus shown in Figure 10.11c and d can be used to achieve a result similar to 
that found in the bell jar experiment. In this case, a sugar solution is separated from 
water by a semipermeable membrane. This may be an animal bladder, a slice of vegetable 
tissue, or a piece of parchment. The membrane, by a mechanism that is not well under-
stood, allows water molecules to pass through it, but not sugar molecules. As before, 
water moves from a region where its mole fraction is high (pure water) to a region where 
it is lower (sugar solution). This process, taking place through a membrane permeable 
only to the solvent, is called osmosis. As a result of osmosis, the water level rises in the 
tube and drops in the beaker (Figure 10.11d).
The osmotic pressure, p, is equal to the external pressure, P, just sufficient to prevent 
osmosis (Figure 10.12, page 314). If P is less than p, osmosis takes place in the normal

ing the external pressure large enough, it is possible to reverse this process (Figure 
10.12b). When P . p, water molecules move through the membrane from the solution 
to pure water. This process, called reverse osmosis, is used to obtain fresh water from 
seawater in arid regions of the world, including Saudi Arabia. It is also used to concen-
trate the sap from which maple syrup is made.
Osmotic pressure, like vapor pressure lowering, is a colligative property. For any 
nonelectrolyte, p is directly proportional to molarity, M. The equation relating these two 
quantities is very similar to the ideal gas law:
	
p 5 nRT
V  5 MRT	
(10.5)
where R is the gas law constant, 0.0821 L · atm/mol · K, and T is the Kelvin temperature. 
Even in dilute solution, the osmotic pressure is quite large. Consider, for example, a 
0.10 M solution at 258C:
p 5 (0.10 mol/L) a0.0821 L # atm

10.3  colligative properties of nonelectrolytes
If a cucumber is placed in a concentrated brine solution, it shrinks and assumes the 
wrinkled skin of a pickle. The skin of the cucumber acts as a semipermeable membrane. 
The water solution inside the cucumber is more dilute than the solution surrounding it. 
As a result, water flows out of the cucumber into the brine (Figure 10.13).
When a dried prune is placed in water, the skin also acts as a semipermeable mem-
brane. This time the solution inside the prune is more concentrated than the water, so 
that water flows into the prune, making the prune less wrinkled.
Nutrient solutions used in intravenous feeding must be isotonic with blood; 
that is, they must have the same osmotic pressure as blood. If the solution is too 
dilute, its osmotic pressure will be less than that of the fluids inside blood cells; in 
that case, water will flow into the cell until it bursts. Conversely, if the nutrient so-
lution has too high a concentration of solutes, water will flow out of the cell until it 
shrivels and dies.

10.3  colligative properties of nonelectrolytes
In carrying out a molar mass determination by freezing point depression, we must 
choose a solvent in which the solute is readily soluble. Usually, several such solvents are 
available. Of these, we tend to pick one that has the largest kf. This makes DTf large and 
thus reduces the percent error in the freezing point measurement. From this point of 
view, cyclohexane or other organic solvents are better choices than water, because their 
kf values are larger.

When using colligative properties to determine the molar mass of the solute, you must first determine the appropriate con-
centration for the desired colligative property.

318
 
chapter TEN  Solutions
Molar masses can also be determined using other colligative properties. Osmotic 
pressure measurements are often used, particularly for solutes of high molar mass, where 
the concentration is likely to be quite low. The advantage of using osmotic pressure is 
that the effect is relatively large. Consider, for example, a 0.0010 M aqueous solution, for 
which
p at 258C 5 0.024 atm 5 18 mm Hg
DTf  1.86 3 1023 8C
DTb  5.2 3 1024 8C
A pressure of 18 mm Hg can be measured relatively accurately; temperature differences 
of the order of 0.0018C are essentially impossible to measure accurately.
10.4 Colligative Properties of Electrolytes
As noted earlier, colligative properties of solutions are directly proportional to the con-
centration of solute particles. On this basis, it is reasonable to suppose that, at a given 
concentration, an electrolyte should have a greater effect on these properties than does a 
nonelectrolyte. When one mole of a nonelectrolyte such as glucose dissolves in water, 
one mole of solute molecules is obtained. On the other hand, one mole of the electrolyte 
NaCl yields two moles of ions (1 mol of Na1, 1 mol of Cl2). With CaCl2, three moles of 
ions are produced per mole of solute (1 mol of Ca21, 2 mol of Cl2).
This reasoning is confirmed experimentally. Compare, for example, the vapor 
pressure lowerings for 1.0 M solutions of glucose, sodium chloride, and calcium chlo-
ride at 258C.
 
 
Glucose
NaCl
CaCl2
 
DP
0.42 mm Hg
0.77 mm Hg
1.3 mm Hg
With many electrolytes, DP is so large that the solid, when exposed to moist air, picks up 
water (deliquesces). This occurs with calcium chloride, whose saturated solution has a 
vapor pressure only 30% that of pure water. If dry CaCl2 is exposed to air in which the 
relative humidity is greater than 30%, it absorbs water and forms a saturated solution. 
Deliquescence continues until the vapor pressure of the solution becomes equal to that 
of the water in the air.
The freezing points of electrolyte solutions, like their vapor pressures, are lower than 
those of nonelectrolytes at the same concentration. Sodium chloride and calcium chlo-
ride are used to lower the melting point of ice on highways; their aqueous solutions can 
have freezing points as low as 221 and 2558C, respectively.
To calculate the freezing point lowering of an electrolyte in water, we use the general 
equation
 
DTf 5 i 3 1.868C/m 3 molality	
(10.6)
the multiplier i in this equation is known as the Van’t Hoff factor. It tells us the number 
of moles of particles in solution (molecules or ions) per mole of solute. For sugar or 
other nonelectrolytes, i is 1:
C12H22O11(s) 9: C12H22O11(aq);        1 mol sugar 9: 1 mol molecules
For NaCl and CaCl2, i should be 2 and 3, respectively.
NaCl(s) 9: Na1(aq) 1 Cl2(aq);        1 mol NaCl 9: 2 mol ions
CaCl2(s) 9: Ca21(aq)1 2Cl2(aq);        1 mol CaCl2 9: 3 mol ions
Similar equations apply for other colligative properties.

10.4  colligative properties of electrolytes
The data in Table 10.3 suggest that the situation is not as simple as this discussion 
implies. The observed freezing point lowerings of NaCl and MgSO4 are smaller than 
would be predicted with i 5 2. For example, 0.50 m solutions of NaCl and MgSO4 freeze 
at 21.68 and 20.9958C, respectively; the predicted freezing point is 21.868C. Only in 
very dilute solution does the multiplier i approach the predicted value of 2.

chapter TEN  Solutions
This behavior is generally typical of electrolytes. Their colligative 
properties deviate considerably from ideal values, even at concentrations 
below 1 m. There are at least a couple of reasons for this effect.
1.  Because of electrostatic attraction, an ion in solution tends to surround 
itself with more ions of opposite than of like charge (Figure 10.14). The existence 
of this ionic atmos­phere, first proposed in 1923 by Peter Debye (1884 –1966), a 
Dutch physical chemist, prevents ions from acting as completely independent 
solute particles. The result is to make an ion somewhat less effective than a non-
electrolyte molecule in its influence on colligative properties.
2.  Oppositely charged ions may interact strongly enough to form a dis-
crete species called an ion pair. This effect is essentially nonexistent with elec-
trolytes such as NaCl, in which the ions have low charges (11, 21). However, 
with MgSO4 (12, 22 ions), ion pairing plays a major role. Even at concentra-
tions as low as 0.1 m, there are more MgSO4 ion pairs than free Mg21 and 
SO422 ions.
Freezing point lowering (or other colligative properties) can be used 
to determine the extent of dissociation of a weak electrolyte in water. The procedure fol-
lowed is illustrated in Example 10.11.

maple Syrup
The collection of maple sap and its conversion to syrup or sugar il-
lustrate many of the principles covered in this chapter. Moreover, in 
northern New england, making maple syrup is an interesting way to 
spend the month of March (Figure A), which separates midwinter 
from “mud season.”
The driving force behind the fl ow of maple sap is by no means 
obvious. The calculated osmotic pressure of sap, a 2% solution of 
sucrose (MM 5 342 g/mol), is
p 5 20/342 mol
1 l
 3 0.0821 l # atm
mol # K 3 280 K 5 1.3 atm
This is suﬃ  cient to push water to a height of about 45 ft; many 
maple trees are taller than that. Besides, a maple tree continues to 
bleed sap for several days after it has been cut down. An alternative 
theory suggests that sap is forced out of the tree by bubbles of 
Co2(g), produced by respiration. When the temperature drops at 
night, the carbon dioxide goes into solution, and the fl ow of sap 
ceases. This would explain the high sensitivity of sap fl ow to tem-
perature; the aqueous solubility of carbon dioxide doubles when 
the temperature falls by 158C.
if you want to make your own maple syrup on a small scale, per-
haps 10 to 20 l per season, there are a few principles to keep in 
mind.
1. Make sure the trees you tap are maples; hemlocks would be 
a particularly poor choice. identify the trees to be tapped in the fall, 
before the leaves fall. if possible, select sugar maples, which 
produce about one liter of maple syrup per tree per season. other 
types of maples are less 
productive.
2. it takes 20 to 40 l of 
sap to yield one liter of 
maple syrup. To remove the 
water, you could freeze the 
sap, as the Native Ameri-
cans did 300 years ago. 
The ice that forms is pure 
water; by discarding it, you 
increase the concentration 
of sugar in the remaining 
solution. large-scale oper-
ators today use reverse 
osmosis to remove about 
half of the water. The re-
mainder must be boiled off .

it’s best to boil off  the water outdoors. if you do this in the 
kitchen, you may not be able to open the doors and windows for a 
couple of weeks. Wood tends to swell when it absorbs a few 
hundred liters of water.
3. When the concentration of sugar reaches 66%, you are at 
the maple syrup stage. The calculated boiling point elevation

is somewhat less than the observed value, about 48C. The tem-
perature rises very rapidly around 1048C (Figure B), which makes 
thermometry the method of choice for detecting the end point. 
Shortly before that point, add a drop or two of vegetable oil to 
prevent foaming; perhaps this is the source of the phrase “spread-
ing oil on troubled waters.”

or a chemical reaction to be feasible, it must occur at a reasonable rate. Consequently, 
it is important to be able to control the rate of reaction. Most often, this means making 
it occur more rapidly. When you carry out a reaction in the general chemistry labora-
tory, you want it to take place quickly. A research chemist trying to synthesize a new drug 
has the same objective. Sometimes, though, it is desirable to reduce the rate of reaction.

This chapter sets forth the principles of chemical kinetics, the study of reaction rates. 
The main emphasis is on those factors that influence rate. These include
• the concentrations of reactants (Sections 11.2, 11.3).
• the process by which the reaction takes place (Section 11.4).
• the temperature (Section 11.5).
• the presence of a catalyst (Section 11.6).
• the reaction mechanism (Section 11.7).
Not every collision, 
not every punctilious trajectory 
by which billiard-ball complexes 
arrive at their calculable meeting 
places leads to reaction.

concentration with time.

11.1  meaning of reaction rate
11.1 Meaning of Reaction Rate
To discuss reaction rate meaningfully, it must be defined precisely. The rate of reaction 
is a positive quantity that expresses how the concentration of a reactant or product 
changes with time. To illustrate what this means, consider the reaction
N2O5(g) 9: 2NO2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g)
As you can see from Figure 11.1, the concentration of N2O5 decreases with time; the 
concentrations of NO2 and O2 increase. Because these species have different coeffi-
cients in the balanced equation, their concentrations do not change at the same rate. 
When one mole of N2O5 decomposes, two moles of NO2 and one-half mole of O2 are 
formed. This means that
2D[N2O5] 5 D3NO24
2
5 D3O24
1
2
where D[ ] refers to the change in concentration in moles per liter. The minus sign in 
front of the N2O5 term is necessary because [N2O5] decreases as the reaction takes place; 
the numbers in the denominator of the terms on the right (2, 1
2) are the coefficients of 
these species in the balanced equation. The rate of reaction can now be defined by divid-
ing by the change in time, Dt:
rate 5 2D3N2O54
Dt
5 D3NO24
2Dt
5 D3O24

2 Dt
More generally, for the reaction
aA 1 bB 9: cC 1 dD
where A, B, C, and D represent substances in the gas phase (g) or in aqueous solution 
(aq), and a, b, c, d are their coefficients in the balanced equation,
 
rate 5 2D3A4

(11.1)
To illustrate the use of this expression, suppose that for the formation of ammonia,
N2(g) 1 3H2(g) 9: 2NH3(g)
molecular nitrogen is disappearing at the rate of 0.10 mol/L per minute, that is, 
D[N2]/Dt 5 20.10 mol/L · min. From the coefficients of the balanced equation, 
we see that the concentration of H2 must be decreasing three times as fast: 
D[H2]/Dt 5 20.30 mol/L · min. By the same token, the concentration of NH3 must

By defining rate this way, it is independent of which species we focus on: N2, H2, or NH3.

The answer obtained in part (c) is not the concentration of D after 20 s but rather the change in the concentration of D. If 
you were given an initial concentration of D ([D]o), then you would be able to obtain [D] after 20 s.
Measurement of Rate
For the reaction
N2O5(g) 9: 2NO2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g)
the rate could be determined by measuring
•	 the absorption of visible light by the NO2 formed; this species has a reddish-brown 
color, whereas N2O5 and O2 are colorless.
•	 the change in pressure that results from the increase in the number of moles of gas 
(1 mol reactant : 21
2 mol product).
The graphs in Figure 11.1 (page 329) show plots of data from measurements of this type.
To find the rate of decomposition of N2O5, it is convenient to use Figure 11.2 (page 
332), which is a magnified version of a portion of Figure 11.1 (page 329). If a tangent is 

332
 
chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
drawn to the curve of concentration versus time, its slope at that point must equal 
D[N2O5]/Dt. But because the reaction rate is 2D[N2O5]/Dt, it follows that
rate 5 2slope of tangent
From Figure 11.2 it appears that the slope of the tangent at t 5 2 min is 
20.028 mol/L · min. Hence
rate at 2 min 5 2(20.028 mol/L · min) 5 0.028 mol/L · min
11.2 Reaction Rate and Concentration
Ordinarily, reaction rate is directly related to reactant concentration. The higher the con-
centration of starting materials, the more rapidly a reaction takes place. Pure hydrogen 
peroxide, in which the concentration of H2O2 molecules is about 40 mol/L, is an ex-
tremely dangerous substance. In the presence of trace impurities, it decomposes 
explosively
H2O2(l) 9: H2O(g) 1 1
2 O2(g)
at a rate too rapid to measure. The hydrogen peroxide you buy in a drugstore is a dilute 
aqueous solution in which [H2O2] < 1 M. At this relatively low concentration, decompo-
sition is so slow that the solution is stable for several months.
The dependence of reaction rate on concentration is readily explained. Ordinarily, 
reactions occur as the result of collisions between reactant molecules. The higher the 
concentration of molecules, the greater the number of collisions in unit time and hence 
the faster the reaction. As reactants are consumed, their concentrations drop, collisions 
occur less frequently, and reaction rate decreases. This explains the common observation 
that reaction rate drops off with time, eventually going to zero when the limiting reactant 
is consumed.
Rate Expression and Rate Constant
The dependence of reaction rate on concentration is readily determined for the decompo-
sition of N2O5. Figure 11.3 (page 333) shows what happens when reaction rate is plotted 
versus [N2O5]. As you would expect, rate increases as concentration increases, going from 
zero when [N2O5] 5 0 to about 0.06 mol/L · min when [N2O5] 5 0.16 M. Moreover, as 
you can see from the figure, the plot of rate versus concentration is a straight line through 
the origin, which means that rate must be directly proportional to the concentration.

11.2  reaction rate and concentration
depends on the concentration of reactant. The proportionality constant k is called a rate 
constant. It is independent of the other quantities in the equation.
As we will see shortly, the rate expression can take various forms, depending on the 
nature of the reaction. It can be quite simple, as in the N2O5 decomposition, or exceed-
ingly complex.
Order of Reaction Involving a Single Reactant
Rate expressions have been determined by experiment for a large number of reactions. 
For the process
A 9: products
the rate expression has the general form
rate 5 k[A]m
The power to which the concentration of reactant A is raised in the rate expression is 
called the order of the reaction, m. If m is 0, the reaction is said to be “zero-order.” If 
m 5 1, the reaction is “first-order”; if m 5 2, it is “second-order”; and so on. Ordinarily, 
the reaction order is integral (0, 1, 2, . . .), but fractional orders such as 3
2 are possible.

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
The order of a reaction must be determined experimentally; it cannot be deduced 
from the coefficients in the balanced equation. This must be true because there is only 
one reaction order, but there are many different ways in which the equation for the reac-
tion can be balanced. For example, although we wrote
N2O5(g) 9: 2NO2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g)
to describe the decomposition of N2O5, it could have been written
2N2O5(g) 9: 4NO2(g) 1 O2(g)
The reaction is still first-order no matter how the equation is written.
One way to find the order of a reaction is to measure the initial rate (i.e., the rate at 
t 5 0) as a function of the concentration of reactant. Suppose, for example, that we make 
up two different reaction mixtures differing only in the concentration of reactant A. We 
now measure the rates at the beginning of reaction, before the concentration of A has 
decreased appreciably. This gives two different initial rates (rate1, rate2) corresponding to 
two different starting concentrations of A, [A]1 and [A]2. From the rate expression,
rate2 5 k[A]2m        rate1 5 k[A]1m

Because all the quantities in this equation are known except m, the reaction order can be 
calculated (Example 11.2).
Another approach is to measure 
concentration as a function of time 
(Section 11.3).

Acetaldehyle, CH3CHO, occurs naturally in oak and tobacco leaves, and also is present in automobile and diesel exhaust.

11.2  reaction rate and concentration
Once the order of the reaction is known, the rate constant is readily calculated. 
Consider, for example, the decomposition of acetaldehyde, where we have shown that 
the rate expression is
rate 5 k[CH3CHO]2
The data in Example 11.2 show that the rate at 600°C is 0.34 mol/L · s when the concen-
tration is 0.20 mol/L. It follows that
k 5 
rate
3CH3CHO42 5 0.34 mol/L # s
10.20 mol/L2 2 5 8.5 L/mol · s
The same value of k would be obtained, within experimental error, using any other data 
pair.
Having established the value of k and the reaction order, the rate is readily calcu-
lated at any concentration. Again, using the decomposition of acetaldehyde as an ex-
ample, we have established that
rate 5 8.5

If the concentration of acetaldehyde were 0.60 M,
rate 5 8.5

Order of Reaction with More Than One Reactant
Many (indeed, most) reactions involve more than one reactant. For a reaction between 
two species A and B,
aA 1 bB 9: products
the general form of the rate expression is
rate 5 k[A]m 3 [B]n
In this equation m is referred to as “the order of the reaction with respect to A.” Similarly, 
n is “the order of the reaction with respect to B.” The overall order of the reaction is the 
sum of the exponents, m 1 n. If m 5 1, n 5 2, then the reaction is first-order in A, 
second-order in B, and third-order overall.

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
When more than one reactant is involved, the order can be determined by holding 
the initial concentration of one reactant constant while varying that of the other reac-
tant. From rates measured under these conditions, it is possible to deduce the order of 
the reaction with respect to the reactant whose initial concentration is varied.
To see how to do this, consider the reaction between A and B referred to above. Sup-
pose we run two different experiments in which the initial concentrations of A differ 
([A]1, [A]2) but that of B is held constant at [B]. Then

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
11.3 Reactant Concentration and Time
The rate expression
rate 5 k[N2O5]
shows how the rate of decomposition of N2O5 changes with concentration. From a prac-
tical standpoint, however, it is more important to know the relation between concentra-
tion and time rather than between concentration and rate. Suppose, for example, you are 
studying the decomposition of dinitrogen pentaoxide. Most likely, you would want to 
know how much N2O5 is left after 5 min, 1 h, or several days. An equation relating rate to 
concentration does not provide that information.
Using calculus, it is possible to develop integrated rate equations relating reactant 
concentration to time. We now examine several such equations, starting with first-order 
reactions.
First-Order Reactions
For the decomposition of N2O5 and other first-order reactions of the type
A 9: products        rate 5 k[A]
it can be shown by using calculus that the relationship between concentration and  
time is*
 
ln 
3A4o
3A4  5 kt 
(11.2a)
where [A]o is the original concentration of reactant, [A] is its concentration at time t, k 
is the first-order rate constant, and the abbreviation “ln” refers to the natural logarithm.
Because ln a/b 5 ln a 2 ln b, the first-order equation can be written in the form
	
ln [A]o 2 ln [A] 5 kt
(11.2b)
Solving for ln [A],
ln [A] 5 ln [A]o 2 kt

1. Substitute a rate and a concentration for (CH3)3CBr and OH2 into the rate expression.
2. Use any rate/concentration pair from any experiment. (We choose experiment 3.)

solution
Changing [OH2] has no effect on the rate of the reaction. The reaction is zero-order (n 5 0) with respect to OH2, which 
means that the rate is independent of its concentration.
*Throughout Section 11.3, balanced chemical equations are written in such a way that the coefficient of the 
reactant is 1. In general, if the coefficient of the reactant is a, where a may be 2 or 3 or . . ., then k in each inte-
grated rate equation must be replaced by the product ak. (See Problem 101.)
There are no speedometers for  
reactions, but every lab has a clock.
Any number raised to the zero power 
equals 1.

339
 
11.3  reactant concentration and time
it is clear that a plot of ln [A] versus t should be a straight line with a y-intercept of ln [A]o 
and a slope of 2k. This is indeed the case, as you can see from Figure 11.4, in which we 
have plotted ln [N2O5] versus t for the decomposition of N2O5. Drawing the best straight 
line through the points and taking the slope based on a point on the x-axis (y2 5 23.5,

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
The analysis of Example 11.4c reveals an important feature of a first-order reaction: 
The time required for one half of a reactant to decompose via a first-order reaction has 
a fixed value, independent of concentration. This quantity, called the half-life, is given 
by the expression
 
t1/2 5 ln 2
k
5 0.693
k
 
 
first-order reaction 
(11.3)
where k is the rate constant. For the decomposition of N2O5, where k 5 0.35/min, t1/2 5 2.0 min. 
Thus every two minutes, one half of a sample of N2O5 decomposes (Table 11.1, page 341).
Notice that for a first-order reaction the rate constant has the units of reciprocal 
time, for example, min21. This suggests a simple physical interpretation of k (at least 
where k is small); it is the fraction of reactant decomposing in unit time. For a first-order 
reaction in which
k 5 0.010/min 5 0.010 min21
we can say that 0.010 (i.e., 1.0%) of the sample decomposes per minute.
Perhaps the most important first-order reaction is that of radioactive decay, in 
which an unstable nucleus decomposes (Chapter 2). Letting X be the amount of a radio-
active isotope present at time t,

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
Half-lives can be interpreted in terms of the level of radiation of the corresponding 
isotopes. Uranium has a very long half-life (4.5 3 109 y), so it gives off radiation very 
slowly. At the opposite extreme is fermium-258, which decays with a half-life of 
3.8 3 1024 s. You would expect the rate of decay to be quite high. Within a second virtu-
ally all the radiation from fermium-258 is gone. Species such as this produce very high 
radiation during their brief existences.
Zero- and Second-Order Reactions
For a zero-order reaction,
A 9: products        rate 5 k[A]0 5 k
because any non-zero quantity raised to the zero power, including [A], is equal to 1. In 
other words, the rate of a zero-order reaction is constant, independent of concentration. 
As you might expect from our earlier discussion, zero-order reactions are relatively rare. 
Most of them take place at solid surfaces, where the rate is independent of concentration 
in the gas phase. A typical example is the thermal decomposition of hydrogen iodide on 
gold:
HI(g) 9
Au: 1
2H2(g) 1 1
2I2(g)
When the gold surface is completely covered with HI molecules, increasing the concen-
tration of HI(g) has no effect on reaction rate.

11.3  reactant concentration and time
It can readily be shown (Problem 87) that the concentration-time relation for a  
zero-order reaction is
	
[A] 5 [A]o 2 kt	
(11.4)
Comparing this equation with that for a straight line,
y 5 b 1 mx        (b 5 y-intercept, m 5 slope)
it should be clear that a plot of [A] versus t should be a straight line with a slope of 2k. 
Putting it another way, if a plot of concentration versus time is linear, the reaction must 
be zero-order; the rate constant k is numerically equal to the slope of that line but has the 
opposite sign.
For a second-order reaction involving a single reactant, such as acetaldehyde (re-
call Example 11.2),
A 9: products        rate 5 k[A]2
it is again necessary to resort to calculus* to obtain the concentration-time relationship

where the symbols [A], [A]o, t, and k have their usual meanings. For a second-order re-

The characteristics of zero-, first-, and second-order reactions are summarized in 
Table 11.2. To determine reaction order, the properties in either of the last two columns 
at the right of the table can be used (Example 11.6).

11.4  models for reaction rate

11.4 Models for Reaction Rate
So far in this chapter we have approached reaction rate from an experimental point of 
view, describing what happens in the laboratory or the world around us. Now we change 
emphasis and try to explain why certain reactions occur rapidly while others take place 
slowly. To do this, we look at a couple of models that chemists have developed to predict 
rate constants for reactions.
Collision Model; Activation Energy
Consider the reaction
CO(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 NO(g)
Above 600 K, this reaction takes place as a direct result of collisions between CO and 
NO2 molecules. When the concentration of CO doubles (Figure 11.6), the number of 
these collisions in a given time increases by a factor of 2; doubling the concentration of 
NO2 has the same effect. Assuming that reaction rate is directly proportional to the col-
lision rate, the following relation should hold:
reaction rate 5 k[CO] 3 [NO2]
Experimentally, this prediction is confirmed; the reaction is first-order in both carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.

b
A single red molecule moves among
10 blue molecules and collides with
2 of them per second.
With double the number of blue
molecules, the number of collisions
doubles to 4 per second.

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
There is a restriction on this simple model for the CO-NO2 reaction. According to 
the kinetic theory of gases, for a reaction mixture at 700 K and concentrations of 0.10 M, 
every CO molecule should collide with about 109 NO2 molecules in one second. If every 
collision were effective, the reaction should be over in a fraction of a second. In reality, 
this does not happen; under these conditions, the half-life is about 10 s. This implies that 
not every CO-NO2 collision leads to reaction.
There are a couple of reasons why collision between reactant molecules does not 
always lead to reaction. For one thing, the molecules have to be properly oriented with 
respect to one another when they collide. Suppose, for example, that the carbon atom of 
a CO molecule strikes the nitrogen atom of an NO2 molecule (Figure 11.7). This is very 
unlikely to result in the transfer of an oxygen atom from NO2 to CO, which is required 
for reaction to occur.
A more important factor that reduces the number of effective collisions has to do 
with the kinetic energy of reactant molecules. These molecules are held together by 
strong chemical bonds. Only if the colliding molecules are moving very rapidly will the 
kinetic energy be large enough to supply the energy required to break these bonds. Mol-
ecules with small kinetic energies bounce off one another without reacting. As a result, 
only a small fraction of collisions are effective.
For every reaction, there is a certain minimum energy that molecules must possess 
for collision to be effective. This is referred to as the activation energy. It has the symbol 
Ea and is expressed in kilojoules/mol. For the reaction between one mole of CO and one 
mole of NO2, Ea is 134 kJ/mol. The colliding molecules (CO and NO2) must have a total 
kinetic energy of at least 134 kJ/mol if they are to react. The activation energy for a reac-
tion is a positive quantity (Ea . 0) whose value depends on the nature of the reaction.
The collision model of reaction rates just developed can be made quantitative. We 
can say that the rate constant for a reaction, k, is a product of three factors:
k 5 p 3 Z 3 f
where
•	 p, called a steric factor, takes into account the fact that only certain orientations of 
colliding molecules are likely to lead to reaction (recall Figure 11.7). Unfortunately, 
the collision model cannot predict the value of p; about all we can say is that it is less 
than 1, sometimes much less.
•	 Z, the collision frequency, which gives the number of molecular collisions occurring in 
unit time at unit concentrations of reactants. This quantity can be calculated quite 
accurately from the kinetic theory of gases, but we will not describe that calculation.
•	 f, the fraction of collisions in which the energy of the colliding molecules is equal to or 
greater than Ea. It can be shown that
f 5 e2Ea/RT
where e is the base of natural logarithms, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute 
temperature in K.
Substituting this expression for f into the equation written above for k, we obtain the 
basic equation for the collision model:
k 5 p 3 Z 3 e2Ea/RT
There would be an explosion.

Figure 11.7 Effective and ineffective 
molecular collisions. For a collision to 
result in reaction, the molecules must 
be properly oriented. For the reaction 
CO(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 NO(g), 
the carbon atom of the CO molecule 
must strike an oxygen atom of the NO2 
molecule, forming CO2 as one product, 
NO as the other.

 
11.4  models for reaction rate
347
This equation tells us, among other things, that the larger the value of Ea, the smaller the 
rate constant. Thus
	
if Ea 5 0, e2Ea/RT 5 e0 5 1
	
Ea 5 RT, e2Ea/RT 5 e21 5 0.37
	
Ea 5 2RT, e2Ea/RT 5 e22 5 0.14
and so on. This makes sense; the larger the activation energy, the smaller the fraction of 
molecules having enough energy to react on collision, so the slower the rate of reaction.
Table 11.3 compares observed rate constants for several reactions with those pre-
dicted by collision theory, arbitrarily taking p 5 1. As you might expect, the calculated 
k’s are too high, suggesting that the steric factor is indeed less than 1.
Transition-State Model; Activation Energy Diagrams
Figure 11.8 is an energy diagram for the CO-NO2 reaction. Reactants CO and NO2 are 
shown at the left. Products CO2 and NO are at the right; they have an energy 226 kJ less 
than that of the reactants. The enthalpy change, DH, for the reaction is 2226 kJ. In the 
center of the figure is an intermediate called an activated complex. This is an unstable, 
high-energy species that must be formed before the reaction can occur. It has an energy 
134 kJ greater than that of the reactants and 360 kJ greater than that of the products. The 
state of the system at this point is often referred to as a transition state, intermediate be-
tween reactants and products.
The exact nature of the activated complex is difficult to determine. For this reaction, 
the activated complex might be a “pseudomolecule” made up of CO and NO2 molecules 
in close contact. The path of the reaction might be more or less as follows:
O#C + O9N
O"C"O + N"O
reactants
activated complex
products
O
O#C
N
O
O
The dotted lines stand for “partial bonds” in the activated com-
plex. The N ! O bond in the NO2 molecule has been partially 
broken. A new bond between carbon and oxygen has started to 
form.
The idea of the activated complex was developed by, among 
others, Henry Eyring at Princeton in the 1930s. It forms the basis 
of the transition-state model for reaction rate, which assumes that 
the activated complex
•	 is in equilibrium, at low concentrations, with the reactants.
•	 may either decompose to products by “climbing” over the en-
ergy barrier or, alternatively, revert back to reactants.
With these assumptions, it is possible to develop an expression for 
the rate constant k. Although the expression is too complex to dis-
cuss here, we show some of the results in Table 11.3.
The transition-state model is generally somewhat more ac-
curate than the collision model (at least with p 5 1). Another ad-
High-energy molecules get the job done.

Chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
vantage is that it explains why the activation energy is ordinarily much smaller than the 
bond enthalpies in the reactant molecules. Consider, for example, the reaction
CO(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 NO(g)
where Ea 5 134 kJ/mol. Th is is considerably smaller than the amount of energy required 
to break any of the bonds in the reactants.
C # O  1075 kJ    N"O  607 kJ    N ! O  222 kJ
Forming the activated complex shown in Figure 11.8 (page 347) requires the absorption of 
relatively little energy, because it requires only the weakening of reactant bonds rather 
than their rupture.
11.5 Reaction Rate and Temperature
Th e rates of most reactions increase as the temperature rises. A person in a hurry to 
prepare dinner applies this principle by turning the dial on the oven to the highest pos-
sible setting. By storing the left overs in a refrigerator, the chemical reactions responsible 
for food spoilage are slowed down. As a general and very approximate rule, it is oft en 
stated that an increase in temperature of 10°C doubles the reaction rate. If this rule holds, 
foods should deteriorate four times as rapidly at room temperature (25°C) as they do in 
a refrigerator at 5°C.
Th e eff ect of temperature on reaction rate can be explained in terms of kinetic theory. 
Recall from Chapter 5 that raising the temperature greatly increases the fraction of mole-
cules having very high speeds and hence high kinetic energies (kinetic energy 5 mu2/2). 
Th ese are the molecules that are most likely to react when they collide. Th e higher the tem-
perature, the larger the fraction of molecules that can provide the activation energy required 
for reaction. Th is eff ect is apparent from Figure 11.9 (page 349), where the distribution of 
kinetic energies is shown at two diff erent temperatures. Notice that the fraction of molecules 
having a kinetic energy equal to or greater than the activation energy Ea (shaded area) is 
considerably larger at the higher temperature. Hence the fraction of eff ective collisions 
increases; this is the major factor causing reaction rate to increase with temperature.
Chemical kinetics, the subject of this 
chapter, evolved from an art into a science 
in the fi rst half of the twentieth century. 
One person more than any other was re-
sponsible for that change: Henry Eyring. 
Born in a Mormon settlement in Mexico, 
Henry immigrated to Arizona with his 
parents in 1912, when the Mexican revolu-
tion broke out. Many years later, he became 
a u.S. citizen, appearing before a judge 
who had just naturalized Albert Einstein.
Eyring’s fi rst exposure to kinetics came 
as a young chemistry instructor at the uni-
versity of Wisconsin in the 1920s. There he 
worked on the thermal decomposition of 
N2O5 (Section 11.2). in 1931 Eyring came 
to princeton, where he developed the 
transition-state model of reaction rates. 
using this model and making reasonable 
guesses about the nature of the activated 
complex, Eyring calculated rate constants 
that agreed well with experiment. After 
15 productive years at princeton, Eyring 
returned to his Mormon roots at the 
university of utah in Salt lake City. While 
serving as dean of the graduate school, he 
found time to do ground-breaking research 
on the kinetics of life processes, including 
the mechanism of aging.
Henry Eyring’s approach to research is 
best described in his own words:
i perceive myself as rather uninhibited, 
with a certain mathematical facility 
and more interest in the broad aspects 
of a problem than the delicate 
nuances. i am more interested in dis-
covering what is over the next rise 
than in assiduously cultivating the 
beautiful garden close at hand.
Henry’s enthusiasm for chemistry spilled 
over into just about every other aspect of 
his life. Each year he challenged his students 
to a 50-yard dash held at the stadium of the 
university of utah. He continued these 
races until he was in his mid-seventies. 
Henry never won, but on one occasion he 
did make the CBS Evening News.

11.5  reaction rate and temperature
The Arrhenius Equation
You will recall from Section 11.4 that the collision model yields the following expression 
for the rate constant:
 
k 5 p 3 Z 3 e2Ea/RT 
(11.6)
The steric factor, p, is presumably temperature-independent. The collision number, Z, is 
relatively insensitive to temperature. For example, when the temperature increases from 
500 to 600 K, Z increases by less than 10%. Hence to a good degree of approximation we 
can write, as far as temperature dependence is concerned,
k 5 Ae2Ea/RT
where A is a constant. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation,
ln k 5 ln A 2 Ea/RT
This equation was first shown to be valid by Svante Arrhenius (Chapter 4) in 1889. It is 
commonly referred to as the Arrhenius equation.

it should be clear that a plot of ln k (“y”) versus 1/T (“x”) should be linear. The slope of

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
11.6 Catalysis
A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed by 
it. It does this by changing the reaction path to one with a lower activation energy. Fre-
quently the catalyzed path consists of two or more steps. In this case, the activation energy 
for the uncatalyzed reaction exceeds that for any of the steps in the catalyzed reaction 
(Figure 11.11, page 353).
Heterogeneous Catalysis
A heterogeneous catalyst is one that is in a different phase from the reaction mixture. 
Most commonly, the catalyst is a solid that increases the rate of a gas-phase or liquid-
phase reaction. An example is the decomposition of N2O on gold:
N2O(g) 9
Au: N2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g)
In the catalyzed decomposition, N2O is chemically adsorbed on the surface of the solid. 
A chemical bond is formed between the oxygen atom of an N2O molecule and a gold

for the N2O molecule to break apart. Symbolically, this process can be shown as
N # N ! O(g) 1 Au(s) 9: N # N ! ! ! O ! ! ! Au(s) 9: N # N(g) 1 O(g) 1 Au(s)
where the broken lines represent weak covalent bonds.
Perhaps the most familiar example of heterogeneous catalysis is the series of reac-
tions that occur in the catalytic converter of an automobile (Figure 11.12). Typically this 
device contains 1 to 3 g of platinum metal mixed with rhodium. The platinum catalyzes 
the oxidation of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons such as benzene, C6H6:
2CO(g) 1 O2(g) 9
Pt: 2CO2(g)
C6H6(g) 1 15
2  O2(g) 9
Pt: 6CO2(g) 1 3H2O(g)
The rhodium acts as a catalyst to destroy nitrogen oxide by the reaction
2NO(g) 9: N2(g) 1 O2(g)
One problem with heterogeneous catalysis is that the solid catalyst is easily “poi-
soned.” Foreign materials deposited on the catalytic surface during the reaction reduce 
or even destroy its effectiveness. A major reason for using unleaded gasoline is that lead 
metal poisons the Pt-Rh mixture in the catalytic converter.
Homogeneous Catalysis
A homogeneous catalyst is one that is present in the same phase as the reactants. It speeds 
up the reaction by forming a reactive intermediate that decomposes to give products. In 
this way, the catalyst provides an alternative process of lower activation energy.
An example of a reaction that is subject to homogeneous catalysis is the decomposi-
tion of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution:

chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
Under ordinary conditions, this reaction occurs very slowly. However, if a solution of 
sodium iodide, NaI, is added, reaction occurs almost immediately; you can see the bub-
bles of oxygen forming.
The catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is believed to take place by a 
two-step path:
Step 1:  H2O2(aq) 1 I2(aq) 9: H2O 1 IO2(aq)
Step 2:  H2O2(aq) 1 IO2(aq) 9: H2O 1 O2(g) 1 I2(aq)
	
2H2O2(aq)	9: 2H2O 1 O2(g)
Notice that the end result is the same as in the direct reaction.
The I2 ions are not consumed in the reaction. For every I2 ion used up in the first 
step, one is produced in the second step. The activation energy for this two-step process 
is much smaller than for the uncatalyzed reaction.
Enzymes
Many reactions that take place slowly under ordinary conditions occur readily in living 
organisms in the presence of catalysts called enzymes. Enzymes are protein molecules of 
high molar mass. An example of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the decomposition of 
hydrogen peroxide:
2H2O2(aq) 9: 2H2O 1 O2(g)
In blood or tissues, this reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called catalase (Figure 11.13). 
When 3% hydrogen peroxide is used to treat a fresh cut or wound, oxygen gas is given 
off rapidly. The function of catalase in the body is to prevent the build-up of hydrogen 
peroxide, a powerful oxidizing agent.
Many enzymes are extremely specific. For example, the enzyme maltase catalyzes 
the hydrolysis of maltose:
C12H22O11(aq) 1 H2O 999: 2C6H12O6(aq)
	
maltose	
maltase
	
glucose
This is the only function of maltase, but it is one that no other enzyme can perform. 
Many such digestive enzymes are required for the metabolism of carbohydrates, pro-
teins, and fats. It has been estimated that without enzymes, it would take upward of 
50 years to digest a meal.

enzyme in the potato is catalyzing the 
decomposition of a hydrogen peroxide 
solution, as shown by the bubbles of

That would make dieting a lot easier.

11.7  reaction mechanisms
Enzymes, like all other catalysts, lower the activation energy for reaction. They 
can be enormously effective; it is not uncommon for the rate constant to increase by 
a factor of 1012 or more. However, from a commercial standpoint, enzymes have some 
drawbacks. A particular enzyme operates best over a narrow range of temperature. 
An increase in temperature frequently deactivates an enzyme by causing the mole-
cule to “unfold,” changing its characteristic shape. Recently, chemists have discovered 
that this effect can be prevented if the enzyme is immobilized by bonding to a solid 
support. Among the solids that have been used are synthetic polymers, porous glass, 
and even stainless steel. The development of immobilized enzymes has led to a host 
of new products. The sweetener aspartame, used in many diet soft drinks, is made 
using the enzyme aspartase in immobilized form.
11.7 Reaction Mechanisms
A reaction mechanism is a description of a path, or a sequence of steps, by which a reac-
tion occurs at the molecular level. In the simplest case, only a single step is involved. This 
is a collision between two reactant molecules. This is the mechanism for the reaction of 
CO with NO2 at high temperatures, above about 600 K:
CO(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: NO(g) 1 CO2(g)
At lower temperatures the reaction between carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide 
takes place by a quite different mechanism. Two steps are involved:
	
NO2(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: NO3(g) 1 NO(g)
	
CO(g) 1 NO3(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 NO2(g)
CO(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: NO(g) 1 CO2(g)
Notice that the overall reaction, obtained by summing the individual steps, is identical 
with that for the one-step process. The rate expressions are quite different, however:
high temperatures:        rate 5 k[CO][NO2]
	
low temperatures:	
rate 5 k[NO2]2
In general, the nature of the rate expression and hence the reaction order depends on the 
mechanism by which the reaction takes place.
Elementary Steps
The individual steps that constitute a reaction mechanism are referred to as elementary 
steps. These steps may be unimolecular
	
A 9: B 1 C	
rate 5 k[A]
bimolecular
	
A 1 B 9: C 1 D	
rate 5 k[A][B]
or, in rare cases, termolecular
	
A 1 B 1 C 9: D 1 E	
rate 5 k[A][B][C]
Notice from the rate expressions just written that the rate of an elementary step is 
equal to a rate constant k multiplied by the concentration of each reactant molecule. 
This rule is readily explained. Consider, for example, a step in which two molecules, A 
and B, collide effectively with each other to form C and D. As pointed out earlier, the 
rate of collision and hence the rate of reaction will be directly proportional to the con-
centration of each reactant.
Reaction mechanisms frequently 
change with T, sometimes with P.

356
 
chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
Slow Steps
Often, one step in a mechanism is much slower than any other. If this is the case, the slow 
step is rate-determining. That is, the rate of the overall reaction can be taken to be that 
of the slow step. Consider, for example, a three-step reaction:
Step 1:  A 9: B	
(fast)
Step 2:  B 9: C	
(slow)
Step 3:  C 9: D    (fast)
	
A 9: D
The rate at which A is converted to D (the overall reaction) is approximately equal to the 
rate of conversion of B to C (the slow step).
To understand the rationale behind this rule, and its limitations, consider an analo-
gous situation. Suppose three people (A, B, and C) are assigned to grade general chem-
istry examinations that contain three questions. On the average, A spends 10 s grading 
question 1 and B spends 15 s grading question 2. In contrast, C, the ultimate procrastina-
tor, takes 5 min to grade question 3. The rate at which exams are graded is
1 exam
10 s 1 15 s 1 300 s 5 1 exam
325 s  5 0.00308 exam/s
This is approximately equal to the rate of the slower grader:
1 exam
300 s  5 0.00333 exam/s
Extrapolating from general chemistry exams to chemical reactions, we can say that
•	 the overall rate of the reaction cannot exceed that of the slowest step.
•	 if that step is by far the slowest, its rate will be approximately equal to that of the over-
all reaction.
•	 the slowest step in a mechanism is ordinarily the one with the highest activation en-
ergy (Figure 11.14).
Deducing a Rate Expression from a Proposed 
Mechanism
As we have seen, rate expressions for reactions must be determined experimentally. 
Once this has been done, it is possible to derive a plausible mechanism compatible with 
the observed rate expression. This, however, is a rather complex process and we will not 
attempt it here. Instead, we will consider the reverse process, which is much more 
straightforward. Given a mechanism for a several-step reaction, how can you deduce the 
rate expression corresponding to that mechanism?

11.7  reaction mechanisms
In principle, at least, all you have to do is to apply the rules just cited.
	 1.	 Find the slowest step and equate the rate of the overall reaction to the rate of that 
step.
	 2.	 Find the rate expression for the slowest step.
To illustrate this process, consider the two-step mechanism for the low-temperature 
reaction between CO and NO2.
	
NO2(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: NO3(g) 1 NO(g)	
(slow)
	
CO(g) 1 NO3(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 NO2(g)    (fast)
	
CO(g) 1 NO2(g) 9: CO2(g) 1 NO(g)
Applying the above rules in order,
rate of overall reaction 5 rate of first step 5 k[NO2]2
This analysis explains why the rate expression for the two-step mechanism is different 
from that for the direct, one-step reaction.
Elimination of Intermediates
Sometimes the rate expression obtained by the process just described involves a reactive 
intermediate, that is, a species produced in one step of the mechanism and consumed in 
a later step. Ordinarily, concentrations of such species are too small to be determined 
experimentally. Hence they must be eliminated from the rate expression if it is to be 
compared with experiment. The final rate expression usually includes only those species 
that appear in the balanced equation for the reaction. Sometimes, the concentration of a 
catalyst is included, but never that of a reactive intermediate.
To illustrate this situation, consider the reaction between nitric oxide and chlorine, 
which is believed to proceed by a two-step mechanism:
Step 1:	
NO(g) 1 Cl2(g) E
k1F NOCl2(g)
	
	
k21	
(fast)
Step 2:  NOCl2(g) 1 NO(g) 9
k2: 2NOCl(g)        (slow)
	
2NO(g) 1 Cl2(g) 9: 2NOCl(g)
The first step occurs rapidly and reversibly; a dynamic equilibrium is set up in which the 
rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Because the second step is slow and 
rate-determining, it follows that
rate of overall reaction 5 rate of step 2 5 k2[NOCl2][NO]
The rate expression just written is unsatisfactory in that it cannot be checked against 
experiment. The species NOCl2 is a reactive intermediate whose concentration is too 
small to be measured accurately, if at all. To eliminate the [NOCl2] term from the rate 
expression, recall that the rates of forward and reverse reactions in step 1 are equal, which 
means that
k1[NO] 3 [Cl2] 5 k21[NOCl2]
Solving for [NOCl2] and substituting in this rate expression,
[NOCl2] 5 k13NO43Cl24
k21
rate of overall reaction 5 k2[NOCl2] 3 [NO] 5 k2k13NO423Cl24
k21
The quotient k2k1/k21 is the experimentally observed rate constant for the reaction, 
which is found to be second-order in NO and first-order in Cl2, as predicted by this 
mechanism.
If the concentration of a species can’t 
be measured, it had better not appear 
in the rate expression.

358
 
chapter eleven  Rate of Reaction
It is important to point out one of the limitations of mechanism studies. Usually 
more than one mechanism is compatible with the same experimentally obtained rate 
expression. To make a choice between alternative mechanisms, other evidence must be 
considered. A classic example of this situation is the reaction between hydrogen and 
iodine
H2(g) 1 I2(g) 9: 2HI(g)
for which the observed rate expression is
rate 5 k[H2][I2]
For many years, it was assumed that the H2-I2 reaction occurs in a single step, a collision 
between an H2 molecule and an I2 molecule. That would, of course, be compatible with 
the rate expression above. However, there is now evidence to indicate that a quite differ-
ent and more complex mechanism is involved (see Problem 77).
The quotient k1k2/k21 is the observed 
rate constant, k.

The Ozone Story
in recent years, a minor component of the atmosphere, ozone, has re-
ceived a great deal of attention. Ozone, molecular formula O3, is a pale 
blue gas with a characteristic odor that can be detected after lightning 
activity, in the vicinity of electric motors, or near a subway train.
depending on its location in the atmosphere, ozone can be a 
villain or a beleaguered hero. in the lower atmosphere (the tropo-
sphere), ozone is bad news; it is a major component of photochem-
ical smog, formed by the reaction sequence
 
NO2(g) 9: NO(g) 1 O(g)
 
O2(g) 1 O(g) 9: O3(g)
NO2(g) 1 O2(g) 9: NO(g) 1 O3(g)
Ozone is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent, which explains its 
toxicity to animals and humans. At partial pressures as low as 
1027 atm, it can cut in half the rate of photosynthesis by plants.
in the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere), the situation is 
quite diff erent. There the partial pressure of ozone goes through a 
maximum of about 1025 atm at an altitude of 30 km. from 95% to 
99% of sunlight in the ultraviolet region between 200 and 300 nm 
is absorbed by ozone in this region, commonly referred to as the 
“ozone layer.” The mechanism by which this occurs can be repre-
sented by the following pair of equations:
O3(g) 1 uV radiation 9: O2(g) 1 O(g)
 
O2(g) 1 O(g) 9: O3(g) 1 heat
uV radiation 9: heat
The net eff ect is simply the conversion of ultraviolet to thermal energy.
if the uV radiation were to reach the surface of the earth, it 
could have several adverse eff ects. A 5% decrease in ozone con-
centration could increase the incidence of skin cancer by 10% to 
20%. ultraviolet radiation is also a factor in diseases of the eye, in-
cluding cataract formation.
Ozone molecules in the stratosphere can decompose by the 
reaction
O3(g) 1 O(g) 9: 2O2(g)
This reaction takes place rather slowly by direct collision between 
an O3 molecule and an O atom. it can occur more rapidly by a two-
step process in which a chlorine atom acts as a catalyst:
 O3(g) 1 Cl(g) 9: O2(g)1 ClO(g) k 5 5.2 3 109 l/mol  s at 220 K
ClO(g) 1 O(g) 9: Cl(g)1 O2(g) 
k 5 2.6 3 1010 l/mol  s at 220 K
 O3(g) 1 O(g) 9: 2O2(g)
A single chlorine atom can bring about the decomposition of tens 
of thousands of ozone molecules. Bromine atoms can substitute 
for chlorine; indeed the rate constant for the Br-catalyzed reaction 
is larger than that for the reaction just cited.
The chlorine atoms that catalyze the decomposition of ozone 
come from chlorofl uorocarbons (CfCs) used in many refrigerators 
and air conditioners. A major culprit is Cf2Cl2, freon, which forms 
Cl atoms when exposed to ultraviolet radiation at 200 nm:
Cf2Cl2(g) 9: Cf2Cl(g) 1 Cl(g)
The two scientists who fi rst suggested (in 1974) that CfCs could 
deplete the ozone layer, f. Sherwood Rowland (1927–) and Mario 
CHEMiSTRy beYOnD the ClaSSrOOM
Molina (1943–), won the 1995 Nobel prize in chemistry, along with 
paul Crutzen (1933–), who fi rst suggested that oxides of nitrogen in 
the atmosphere could catalyze the decomposition of ozone.
The catalyzed decomposition of ozone is known to be respon-
sible for the ozone hole (figure A) that develops in Antarctica each 
year in September and October, at the end of winter in the South-
ern Hemisphere. No ozone is generated during the long, dark Ant-
arctic winter. Meanwhile, a heterogeneous reaction occurring on 
clouds of ice crystals at 285°C produces species such as Cl2, Br2, 
and HOCl. When the Sun reappears in September, these molecules 
decompose photochemically to form Cl or Br atoms, which cata-
lyze the decomposition of ozone, lowering its concentration.
Ozone depletion is by no means restricted to the Southern Hemi-
sphere. in the extremely cold winter of 1994–1995, a similar “ozone 
hole” was found in the Arctic. Beyond that, the concentration of 
ozone in the atmosphere over parts of Siberia dropped by 40%.

mong the topics covered in Chapter 9 was the equilibrium between liquid and gas-
eous water:
H2O(l) EF H2O(g)
The state of this equilibrium system at a given temperature can be described in a simple way 
by citing the equilibrium pressure of water vapor: 0.034 atm at 258C, 1.00 atm at 1008C, 
and so on.
Chemical reactions involving gases carried out in closed containers resemble in many 
ways the H2O(l)–H2O(g) system. The reactions are reversible; reactants are not completely 
consumed. Instead, an equilibrium mixture containing both products and reactants is ob-
tained. At equilibrium, forward and reverse reactions take place at the same rate. As a result, 
the amounts of all species at equilibrium remain constant with time.
Ordinarily, where gaseous chemical equilibria are involved, more than one gaseous sub-
stance is present. We might, for example, have a system,
aA(g) 1 bB(g) EF cC(g) 1 dD(g)
Order is not pressure which is imposed 
on society from without, but an 
equilibrium which is set up from within.

12.1  the n2o4–no2 equilibrium system
in which the equilibrium mixture contains two gaseous products (C and D) and two gaseous 
reactants (A and B). To describe the position of this equilibrium, we must cite the partial 
pressure of each species, that is, PC, PD, PA, and PB.
Recall from Chapter 5 that the partial pressure of a gas, i, in a mixture is given by the 
expression
Pi 5 niRT /V
It follows that, for an equilibrium mixture confined in a closed container of volume V at 
temperature T, the partial pressure (Pi) of each species is directly proportional to the num-
ber of moles (ni) of that species.
It turns out that there is a relatively simple relationship between the partial pressures of 
different gases present at equilibrium in a reaction system. This relationship is expressed in 
terms of a quantity called the equilibrium constant, symbol K.* In this chapter, you will learn 
how to
• write the expression for K corresponding to any chemical equilibrium (Section 12.2).
• calculate the value for K from experimental data for the equilibrium system (Section 
12.3).
• use the value of K to predict the extent to which a reaction will take place (Section 12.4).
• use K, along with Le Châtelier’s principle, to predict the result of disturbing an equilib-
rium system (Section 12.5).
12.1 The N2O4–NO2 Equilibrium System
Consider what happens when a sample of N2O4, a colorless gas, is placed in a closed, 
evacuated container at 1008C. Instantly, a reddish-brown color develops. This color is 
due to nitrogen dioxide, NO2, formed by decomposition of part of the N2O4 (Figure 12.1):
N2O4(g) 9: 2NO2(g)
*Thermodynamically, the quantity that should appear for each species in the expression for K is the activity 
rather than the partial pressure. Activity is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium partial pressure to the stan-
dard pressure, 1 atm. This means that the activity and hence the equilibrium constant K are dimensionless, that 
is, pure numbers without units.
Reactions can often be reversed by 
changing the temperature or pressure.
Don’t confuse the equilibrium constant 
K with the rate constant k.

Figure 12.2 Approach to equilibrium in the N2O4–NO2 system. The partial pressure of 
N2O4 starts off at 1.00 atm, drops sharply at first, and finally levels off at the equilibrium value 
of 0.22 atm. Meanwhile, the partial pressure of NO2 rises from zero to its equilibrium value, 
1.56 atm.
At first, this is the only reaction taking place. As soon as some NO2 is formed, however, 
the reverse reaction can occur:
2NO2(g) 9: N2O4(g)
Overall, the partial pressure of N2O4 drops, and the forward reaction slows down. 
Conversely, the partial pressure of NO2 increases, so the rate of the reverse reaction in-
creases. Soon these rates become equal. A dynamic equilibrium has been established.
N2O4(g) EF 2NO2(g)
At equilibrium, appreciable amounts of both gases are present. From that point on, the 
amounts of both NO2 and N2O4 and their partial pressures remain constant, so long as 
the volume of the container and the temperature remain unchanged.
The characteristics just described are typical of all systems at equilibrium. First, the 
forward and reverse reactions are taking place at the same rate. This explains why the 
concentrations of species present remain constant with time. Moreover, these concentra-
tions are independent of the direction from which equilibrium is approached.
The approach to equilibrium in the N2O4–NO2 system is illustrated by the data in 
Table 12.1 and by Figure 12.2 (time is in arbitrary units). Originally, only N2O4 is present; 
its pressure is 1.00 atm. Because no NO2 is around, its original pressure is zero. As equi-
librium is approached, the overall reaction is
N2O4(g) 9: 2NO2(g)

373
 
12.1  the n2o4–no2 equilibrium system
The amount and hence the partial pressure of N2O4 drop, rapidly at first, then more 
slowly. The partial pressure of NO2 increases. Finally, both partial pressures level off and 
become constant. At equilibrium, at 1008C,
PN2O4 5 0.22 atm    PNO2 5 1.56 atm
There are many ways to approach equilibrium in the N2O4–NO2 system. Table 12.2 
gives data for three experiments in which the original conditions are quite different. Ex-
periment 1 is that just described, starting with pure N2O4. Experiment 2 starts with pure 
NO2 at a partial pressure of 1.00 atm. As equilibrium is approached, some of the NO2 re-
acts to form N2O4:
2NO2(g) 9: N2O4(g)
Finally, in Experiment 3, both N2O4 and NO2 are present originally, each at a partial 
pressure of 1.00 atm.
Looking at the data in Table 12.2, you might wonder whether these three experi-
ments have anything in common. Specifically, is there any relationship between the equi-
librium partial pressures of NO2 and N2O4 that is valid for all the experiments? It turns 
out that there is, although it is not an obvious one. The value of the quotient (PNO2)2/PN2O4 
is the same, about 11, in each case:

12.162 2
0.42  5 11
You may wonder why the equilibrium constant, 11, has no units. The reason is  
that each term in the reaction quotient represents the ratio of the measured pressure of 
the gas to the thermodynamic standard state of one atmosphere. Thus the quotient 
(PNO2)2/PN2O4 in Experiment 1 becomes
K 5 
a1.56 atm
1 atm b
2
a0.22 atm

 5 11
This relationship holds for any equilibrium mixture containing N2O4 and NO2 at 
1008C. More generally, it is found that, at any temperature, the quantity
1PNO22 2
PN2O4
where PNO2 and PN2O4 are equilibrium partial pressures in atmospheres, is a constant, in-

These pressures don’t change, be-

chapter TWELVE  Gaseous Chemical Equilibrium
dependent of the original composition, the volume of the container, or the total pressure. 
This constant is referred to as the equilibrium constant K for the system
N2O4(g) EF 2NO2(g)
The equilibrium constant for this system, like all equilibrium constants, changes with 
temperature. At 1008C, K for the N2O4–NO2 system is 11; at 1508C, it has a different value, 
about 110. Any mixture of NO2 and N2O4 at 1008C will react in such a way that the ratio 
(PNO2)2/PN2O4 becomes equal to 11. At 1508C, reaction occurs until this ratio becomes 110.
12.2 The Equilibrium Constant Expression
For every gaseous chemical system, an equilibrium constant expression can be written 
stating the condition that must be attained at equilibrium. For the general system involv-
ing only gases,
aA(g) 1 bB(g) EF cC(g) 1 dD(g)
where A, B, C, and D represent different substances and a, b, c, and d are their coeffi-
cients in the balanced equation,
 
K 5 
1PC2 c 3 1PD2 d
1PA2 a 3 1PB2 b 
(12.1)
where PC, PD, PA, and PB are the partial pressures of the four gases at equilibrium. These 
partial pressures must be expressed in atmospheres. Notice that in the expression for K
•	 the equilibrium partial pressures of products (right side of equation) appear in the 
numerator.
•	 the equilibrium partial pressures of reactants (left side of equation) appear in the 
denominator.
•	 each partial pressure is raised to a power equal to its coefficient in the balanced equation.
This equilibrium constant is often given the symbol Kp to emphasize that it involves 
partial pressures. Other equilibrium expressions for gases are sometimes used, including Kc:
Kc 5 3C4c 3 3D4d
3A4a 3 3B4b
where the brackets represent equilibrium concentrations in moles per liter. The two con-
stants, Kc and Kp, are simply related (see Problem 78):
Kp 5 Kc(RT)Dng
where Dng is the change in the number of moles of gas in the equation, R is the gas law 
constant, 0.0821 L ? atm/mol ? K, and T is the Kelvin temperature. Throughout this chap-
ter, we deal only with Kp, referring to it simply as K.
Changing the Chemical Equation
It is important to realize that the expression for K depends on the form of the chemical 
equation written to describe the equilibrium system. To illustrate what this statement 
means, consider the N2O4–NO2 system:
N2O4(g) EF 2NO2(g)    K 5 
1PNO22 2
PN2O4
Many other equations could be written for this system, for example,
1
2N2O4(g) EF NO2(g)
In this case, the expression for the equilibrium constant would be
K9 5 
PNO2
1PN2O42 1/2
K is meaningless unless accompanied 
by a chemical equation.

375
 
12.2  the equilibrium constant expression
Comparing the expressions for K and K9, it is clear that K9 is the square root of K. 
This illustrates a general rule, sometimes referred to as the coefficient rule, which 
states,
If the coefficients in a balanced equation are multiplied by a factor n, the equilibrium con­
stant is raised to the nth power:
	
K9 5 Kn 
(12.2)
In this particular case, n 5 1
2 because the coefficients were divided by 2. Hence K9 is the 
square root of K. If K 5 11, then K9 5 (11)1/2 5 3.3.
Another equation that might be written to describe the N2O4–NO2 system is
2NO2(g) EF N2O4(g)
for which the equilibrium constant expression is
K 5 
PN2O4
1PNO22 2
This chemical equation is simply the reverse of that written originally; N2O4 and NO2 
switch sides of the equation. Notice that K0 is the reciprocal of K; the numerator and 
denominator have been inverted. This illustrates the reciprocal rule:
The equilibrium constants for forward and reverse reactions are the reciprocals of each 
other,
	
K0 5 1/K	
(12.3)
If, for example, K 5 11, then K0 5 1/11 5 0.091.
Adding Chemical Equations
A property of K that you will find very useful in this and succeeding chapters is ex-
pressed by the rule of multiple equilibria, which states
If a reaction can be expressed as the sum of two or more reactions, K for the overall reaction 
is the product of the equilibrium constants of the individual reactions.
That is, if
reaction 3 5 reaction 1 1 reaction 2
then
 
K (reaction 3) 5 K (reaction 1) 3 K (reaction 2) 
(12.4)
To illustrate the application of this rule, consider the following reactions at 7008C:
	
SO2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g) EF SO3(g)	
K 5 2.2
NO2(g) EF NO(g) 1 1
2 O2(g)    K 5 4.0
Adding these equations eliminates 1
2 O2; the result is
SO2(g) 1 NO2(g) EF SO3(g) 1 NO(g)
For this overall reaction, K 5 2.2 3 4.0 5 8.8.
The validity of this rule can be demonstrated by writing the expression for K for the 
individual reactions and multiplying:
PSO3
1PSO22 1PO22 1/2 3
1PNO2 1PO22 1/2
PNO2
5
1PSO32 1PNO2
1PSO22 1PNO22
The product expression, at the right, is clearly the equilibrium constant for the overall 
reaction, as it should be according to the rule of multiple equilibria.
Table 12.3 summarizes the rules for writing the expression for the equilibrium 
constant.
We will use this relationship frequently 
in later chapters.

Heterogeneous Equilibria
In the reactions described so far, all the reactants and products have been gaseous; the 
equilibrium systems are homogeneous. In certain reactions, at least one of the substances 
involved is a pure liquid or solid; the others are gases. Such a system is heterogeneous, 
because more than one phase is present. Examples include
CO2(g) 1 H2(g) EF CO(g) 1 H2O(l)
I2(s) EF I2(g)

378
 
chapter TWELVE  Gaseous Chemical Equilibrium
Experimentally, it is found that for such systems
•	 the position of the equilibrium is independent of the amount of solid or liquid, as 
long as some is present.
•	 terms for pure liquids or solids need not appear in the expression for K.
To see why this is the case, consider the data in Table 12.4 for the system
CO2(g) 1 H2(g) EF CO(g) 1 H2O(l)
at 258C. In Experiments 1 through 4, liquid water is present, so the partial pressure of 
water in the gas phase, PH2O, is constant at 0.03 atm, the equilibrium vapor pressure of 
water at 258C.

A similar argument can be applied to the equilibrium involved in the sublimation of

12.3  determination of K
In this and succeeding chapters, a wide variety of different types of equilibria will be 
covered. They may involve gases, pure liquids or solids, and species in aqueous solution. 
It will always be true that in the expression for the equilibrium constant
•	 gases enter as their partial pressures in atmospheres.
•	 pure liquids or solids do not appear; neither does the solvent for a reaction in dilute 
solution.
•	 species (ions or molecules) in water solution enter as their molar concentrations.

We will have more to say in later chapters about equilibria involving species in aqueous 
solution.
12.3 Determination of K
Numerical values of equilibrium constants can be calculated if the partial pressures of 
products and reactants at equilibrium are known. Sometimes you will be given equilib-
rium partial pressures directly (Example 12.3). At other times you will be given the origi-
nal partial pressures and the equilibrium partial pressure of one species (Example 12.4). 
In that case, the calculation of K is a bit more difficult, because you have to calculate the 
equilibrium partial pressures of all the species.

K 5 1/PH2.

(a) the reduction of black solid copper(II) oxide (1 mol) with hydrogen to form copper metal and steam.
(b) the reaction of one mole of steam with red-hot coke (carbon) to form a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, 
called water gas.
strategy
1. Write a balanced chemical equation for the equilibrium system. Do not forget to include physical states.
2. Write the expression for K, leaving out pure solids and liquids.
3. Recall that gases are represented by their partial pressures.

12.3  determination of K
strategy and solution
1. Create a table (shown below) and enter the pertinent information (both explicit and implied) from the statement of the 
problem. Note that the problem states that only HI is initially present. Your table looks like this:
 
2HI(g) 
EF

I2(g)
Po (atm)	
1.00

Peq (atm)	
	
	
0.10
2. Find a column where only one entry is missing. In this case it is the H2(g) column. The missing entry can be determined 
algebraically. By noting that initially the pressure is 0 atm and at equilibrium, the pressure is 0.10 atm. The change, DP, 
must be 1 0.10 atm. All changes will be shaded in green.

Peq (atm)

3. Since the system is at constant volume and temperature, the number of moles must be directly proportional to the pres-
sure. Use the coefficients of the reaction to determine stoichiometric ratios. (Recall Chapter 3.) Fill in the rest of the row 
labeled DP with 0.10 atm multiplied by the stoichiometric ratios:
1 mol I2/1 mol H2    2 mol HI/1 mol H2
 
Use 1 signs for species produced and 2 signs for species used up.

chapter TWELVE  Gaseous Chemical Equilibrium
Example 12.4 illustrates a principle that you will find very useful in solving equilib-
rium problems throughout this (and later) chapters. As a system approaches equilib­
rium, changes in partial pressures of reactants and products—like changes in molar 
amounts—are related to one another through the coefficients of the balanced 
equation.
12.4 Applications of the Equilibrium Constant
Sometimes, knowing only the magnitude of the equilibrium constant, it is possible to 
decide on the feasibility of a reaction. Consider, for example, a possible method for “fix-
ing” atmos­pheric nitrogen—converting it to a compound—by reaction with oxygen:
N2(g) 1 O2(g) EF 2NO(g)
K 5 
1PNO2 2
1PN22 1PO22  5 1 3 10230 at 258C
Because K is so small, the partial pressure of NO in equilibrium with N2 and O2, and 
hence the amount of NO, must be extremely small, approaching zero. Clearly, this would 
not be a suitable way to fix nitrogen, at least at 258C.
An alternative approach to nitrogen fixation involves reacting it with hydrogen:
N2(g) 1 3H2(g) EF 2NH3(g)
K 5 
1PNH32 2
1PN22 1PH22 3 5 6 3 105 at 258C 
In this case, the equilibrium system must contain mostly ammonia. A mixture of N2 and 
H2 should be almost completely converted to NH3 at equilibrium.
In general, if K is a very small number, the equilibrium mixture will contain mostly 
unreacted starting materials; for all practical purposes, the forward reaction does not go. 
Conversely, a large K implies a reaction that, at least in principle, is feasible; products 
should be formed in high yield. Frequently, K has an intermediate value, in which case 
you must make quantitative calculations concerning the direction or extent of reaction.
Direction of Reaction; the Reaction Quotient (Q)
Consider the general gas-phase reaction
aA(g) 1 bB(g) EF cC(g) 1 dD(g)

5 10.102 10.102
10.802 2
5 0.016
end point
You should expect K to be rather small (0.016). Recall that at equilibrium, PH2 is 0.10 atm, only one tenth of the original 
pressure of HI (1.00 atm).
The concept of equilibrium is most 
useful when K is neither very large nor 
very small.

383
 
12.4  applications of the equilibrium constant
As we have seen, for a given system at a particular temperature, the value of K is fixed.
In contrast, the actual pressure ratio, Q,
Q 5 
(PC)c(PD)d
	
(PA)a(PB)b
can have any value at all. If you start with pure reactants (A and B), PC and PD are zero, 
and the value of Q is zero:
(0)(0)
Q 5 
(PA)a(PB)b 5 0
Conversely, starting with only C and D, the value of Q becomes infinite as the values of 
PA and PB approach zero:
(PC)c(PD)d
Q 5 
(PA)a(PB)b : 0
  9: 
If all four substances are present, Q can have any value between zero and infinity.
The form of the expression for Q, known as the reaction quotient, is the same as 
that for the equilibrium constant, K. The difference is that the partial pressures that ap-
pear in Q are those that apply at a particular moment, not necessarily when the system 
is at equilibrium. By comparing the numerical value of Q with that of K, it is possible to 
decide in which direction the system will move to achieve equilibrium.
1.  If Q , K the reaction proceeds from left to right:
aA(g) 1 bB(g) 9: cC(g) 1 dD(g)
In this way, the partial pressures of products increase, while those of reactants decrease.  
As this happens, the reaction quotient Q increases and eventually at equilibrium be-
comes equal to K.
2.  If Q . K the partial pressures of products are “too high” and those of the reactants 
“too low” to meet the equilibrium condition. Reaction proceeds in the reverse direction:
aA(g) 1 bB(g) ;9 cC(g) 1 dD(g)
increasing the partial pressures of A and B while reducing those of C and D. This lowers 
Q to its equilibrium value, K.
3.  If perchance Q 5 K, the system is already at equilibrium, so the amounts of 
products and reactants remain unchanged.
To illustrate these statements, consider the simple system shown in Table 12.5.
Q can have any value; K is fixed.
As equilibrium is approached,  
Q approaches K.

Extent of Reaction; Equilibrium Partial Pressures
The equilibrium constant for a chemical system can be used to calculate the partial pres-
sures of the species present at equilibrium. In the simplest case, one equilibrium pressure 
can be calculated, knowing all the others. Consider, for example, the system
N2(g) 1 O2(g) EF 2NO(g)

When we say that the reaction proceeds from left to right or in the forward direction, we refer to the reaction as written. In 
this case, the partial pressure of NO2 increases while that of N2O4 decreases until the system reaches equilibrium.

385
 
12.4  applications of the equilibrium constant
In air, the partial pressures of N2 and O2 are about 0.78 and 0.21 atm, respectively. The 
expression for K can be used to calculate the equilibrium partial pressure of NO under 
these conditions:
	
(PNO)2 5 (PN2)(PO2)(K)
	
5 (0.78)(0.21)(1 3 10230) 5 1.6 3 10231
	
PNO 5 (1.6 3 10231)1/2 5 4 3 10216 atm
This is an extremely small pressure, as you might have guessed from the small magnitude 
of the equilibrium constant.
More commonly K is used to determine the equilibrium partial pressures of all spe-
cies, reactants, and products, knowing their original pressures. To do this, it helps to 
follow this path.
1.  Create a table to keep track of all information. This was illustrated in Example 12.4.
2.  Choose DP for one of the species to be represented by x. A good choice would be 
a species that has a coefficient of 1 in its balanced equation and/or a species that is not 
present initially. Relate DP of the chosen species to the other species by using the stoi-
chiometric ratios provided by the coefficients in the balanced equation.
3.  Determine the direction of the reaction and assign 1 or 2 signs to the entries 
in the row for DP.
—The reaction proceeds in the direction where initial pressure is 0.
—If all the species have initial partial pressures, find Q.
4.  Fill in the row for equilibrium partial pressures.
5.  Write the expression for K and substitute the entries for equilibrium partial 
pressure into the expression. Solve for x.
6.  Having found x, refer back to the table and calculate the equilibrium partial 
pressures of all species.
That’s just as well; if N2 and O2 in the 
atmosphere were converted to NO, 
we’d be in big trouble.

12.5  effect of changes in conditions on an equilibrium system
We should point out that the calculations in Example 12.6 assume ideal gas behav-
ior. At the conditions specified (1 atm, relatively high temperatures), this assumption is a 
good one. However, many industrial gas-phase reactions are carried out at very high 
pressures. In that case, intermolecular forces become important, and calculated yields 
based on ideal gas behavior may be seriously in error.
12.5 Effect of Changes in Conditions on an 
Equilibrium System
Once a system has attained equilibrium, it is possible to change the ratio of products to 
reactants by changing the external conditions. We will consider three ways in which a 
chemical equilibrium can be disturbed:
	 1.	 Adding or removing a gaseous reactant or product.
	 2.	 Compressing or expanding the system.
	 3.	 Changing the temperature.
You can deduce the direction in which an equilibrium will shift when one of these 
changes is made by applying the following principle:
If a system at equilibrium is disturbed by a change in concentration, pressure, or tempera­
ture, the system will, if possible, shift to partially counteract the change.
This law was first stated, in a more complex form, in 1884 by Henri Le Châtelier  
(1850 –1936), a French chemist who had studied a variety of industrial equilibria, includ-
ing those involved in the production of iron in the blast furnace. The statement is com-
monly referred to as Le Châtelier’s principle.
Adding or Removing a Gaseous Species
According to Le Châtelier’s principle, if a chemical system at equilibrium is disturbed 
by adding a gaseous species (reactant or product), the reaction will proceed in such a 
direction as to consume part of the added species. Conversely, if a gaseous species is 
removed, the system shifts to restore part of that species. In that way, the change in con-
centration brought about by adding or removing a gaseous species is partially counter-
acted when equilibrium is restored.
To apply this general rule, consider the reaction
N2O4(g) EF 2NO2(g)
 
Apply the quadratic formula: x 5 2b 6 Íb2 2 4ac
2a
 !: x 5 0.60 or 25.93
 
0.60 atm is plausible; 25.93 atm would imply a negative partial pressure.

chapter TWELVE  Gaseous Chemical Equilibrium
Suppose this system has reached equilibrium at a certain temperature. This equilibrium 
could be disturbed by
•	 adding N2O4. Reaction will occur in the forward direction (left to right). In this way, 
part of the N2O4 will be consumed.
•	 adding NO2, which causes the reverse reaction (right to left) to occur, using up part of 
the NO2 added.
•	 removing N2O4. Reaction occurs in the reverse direction to restore part of the N2O4.
•	 removing NO2, which causes the forward reaction to occur, restoring part of the NO2 
removed.
It is possible to use K to calculate the extent to which reaction occurs when an equilib-
rium is disturbed by adding or removing a product or reactant. To see how this is done, 
consider the effect of adding hydrogen iodide to the HI–H2–I2 system (Example 12.7).

1. Create a table. Note that the equilibrium partial pressures now become initial pressures for HI and I2. 
Po for HI is now 1.00 atm.
2. Since HI is added, the reaction goes in the direction of using up the HI, thus to the right.
3. Write the K expression and solve for x.
4. Substitute the value for x into the equilibrium pressures for all species.

12.5  effect of changes in conditions on an equilibrium system
We should emphasize that adding a pure liquid or solid has no effect on a system at 
equilibrium. The rule is a simple one: For a species to shift the position of an equilibrium, 
it must appear in the expression for K.
Compression or Expansion
To understand how a change in pressure can change the position of an equilibrium, con-
sider again the N2O4–NO2 system:
N2O4(g) EF 2NO2(g)
Suppose the system is compressed by pushing down the piston shown in Figure 12.3. The 
immediate effect is to increase the gas pressure because the same number of molecules are 
crowded into a smaller volume (P 5 nRT/V). According to Le Châtelier’s principle, the 
system will shift to partially counteract this change. There is a simple way in which the gas 
pressure can be reduced. Some of the NO2 molecules combine with each other to form 
N2O4 (cylinder at right of Figure 12.3). That is, reaction occurs in the reverse direction:
N2O4(g) ;9 2NO2(g)
This reduces the number of moles, n, and hence the pressure, P.
It is possible (but not easy) to calculate from K the extent to which NO2 is converted 
to N2O4 when the system is compressed. The results of such calculations are given in 
Table 12.6. As the pressure is increased from 1.0 to 10.0 atm, more and more of the NO2 
is converted to N2O4. Notice that the total number of moles of gas decreases steadily as a 
result of this conversion.
The analysis we have just gone through for the N2O4–NO2 system can be applied to 
any equilibrium system involving gases
•	 When the system is compressed, thereby increasing the total pressure, reaction takes 
place in the direction that decreases the total number of moles of gas.
•	 When the system is expanded, thereby decreasing the total pressure, reaction takes 
place in the direction that increases the total number of moles of gas.
end point
Note that the equilibrium partial pressure of HI is intermediate between its value before equilibrium was established 
(0.80 atm) and that immediately afterward (1.00 atm). This is exactly what LeChâtelier’s principle predicts: part of the added 
HI is consumed to reestablish equilibrium!
Figure 12.3 Effect of compression 
on the N2O4(g) EF 2NO2(g) system 
at equilibrium. The immediate effect 
(middle cylinder) is to crowd the same 
number of moles of gas into a smaller 
volume and thus increase the total 
pressure. This is partially compensated 
for by the conversion of some of the 
NO2 to N2O4, thereby reducing the total 
number of moles of gas.
The system does not return to its 
original equilibrium state.
When V decreases, NO2 is converted 
to N2O4.

chapter TWELVE  Gaseous Chemical Equilibrium
The application of this principle to several different systems is shown in Table 12.7. 
In system 2, the number of moles of gas decreases from 3
2 to 1 as the reaction goes to 
the right. Hence increasing the pressure causes the forward reaction to occur; a de-
crease in pressure has the reverse effect. Notice that it is the change in the number of 
moles of gas that determines which way the equilibrium shifts (system 4). When there 
is no change in the number of moles of gas (system 5), a change in pressure has no ef-
fect on the position of the equilibrium.
We should emphasize that in applying this principle it is important to realize that an 
“increase in pressure” means that the system is compressed; that is, the volume is de-
creased. Similarly, a “decrease in pressure” corresponds to expanding the system by in-
creasing its volume. There are other ways in which pressure can be changed. One way is 
to add an unreactive gas such as helium at constant volume. This increases the total 
number of moles and hence the total pressure. It has no effect, however, on the position 
of the equilibrium, because it does not change the partial pressures of any of the gases 
taking part in the reaction. Remember that the partial pressure of a gas A is given by the 
expression
PA 5 nART/V        (nA 5 no. of moles of A)
Adding a different gas at constant volume does not change any of the quantities on the 
right side of this equation, so PA stays the same.
Change in Temperature
Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect of a change in temperature on 
the position of an equilibrium. In general, an increase in temperature causes the endo­
thermic reaction to occur. This absorbs heat and so tends to reduce the temperature of 
the system, partially compensating for the original temperature increase.
Applying this principle to the N2O4–NO2 system,
N2O4(g) EF 2NO2(g)        DH8 5 157.2 kJ
it follows that raising the temperature causes the forward reaction to occur, because that 
reaction absorbs heat. This is confirmed by experiment (Figure 12.4, page 391). At higher

more intense.
For the synthesis of ammonia,
N2(g) 1 3H2(g) EF 2NH3(g)        DH8 5 292.2 kJ
an increase in temperature shifts the equilibrium to the left; some ammonia decomposes 
to the elements. This reflects the fact that the reverse reaction is endothermic:
2NH3(g) 9: N2(g) 1 3H2(g)        DH8 5 192.2 kJ
As pointed out earlier, the equilibrium constant of a system changes with temperature. 
The form of the equation relating K to T is a familiar one, similar to the Clausius-
Clapeyron equation (Chapter 9) and the Arrhenius equation (Chapter 11). This one is 
called the van’t Hoff equation, honoring Jacobus van’t Hoff (1852–1911), who was the 
first to use the equilibrium constant, K. Coincidentally, van’t Hoff was a good friend of 
Arrhenius. The equation is
 
ln K2

where K2 and K1 are the equilibrium constants at T2 and T1, respectively, DH8 is the stan-
dard enthalpy change for the forward reaction, and R is the gas constant, 8.31 J/mol · K.
To illustrate how this equation is used, let us apply it to calculate the equilibrium 
constant at 1008C for the system

Notice that the equilibrium constant becomes smaller as the temperature increases. In  
general,
•	 if the forward reaction is exothermic, as is the case here (DH8 5 292.2 kJ), K de-
creases as T increases.
•	 if the forward reaction is endothermic as in the decomposition of N2O4,

K increases as T increases. For this reaction K is 0.11 at 258C and 11 at 1008C.

1. An increase in pressure tends to drive the equilbrium in a direction where there are fewer moles of gas.
2. An increase in temperature favors an endothermic reaction (DH . 0), i.e., creates more products.

An Industrial Application of Gaseous 
Equilibrium
A wide variety of materials, both pure substances and mixtures, are 
made by processes that involve one or more gas-phase reactions. 
Among these is one of the most important industrial chemicals, 
ammonia.
The process used to make this chemical applies many of the 
principles of chemical equilibrium, discussed in this chapter, and 
chemical kinetics (Chapter 11).
haber process for Ammonia
Combined (“fi xed”) nitrogen in the form of protein is essential to all 
forms of life. There is more than enough elementary nitrogen in 
the air, about 4 3 1018 kg, to meet all our needs. The problem is to 
convert the element to compounds that can be used by plants to 
make proteins. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, N2
does not react with any nonmetal. However, in 1908 in germany, 
Fritz Haber (Figure A) showed that nitrogen does react with hy-
drogen at high temperatures and pressures to form ammonia in 
good yield:
N2(g) 1 3H2(g) EF 2NH3(g)    DH8 5 292.2 kJ
The Haber process, represented by this equation, is now the 
main source of fi xed nitrogen. Its feasibility depends on choosing 
conditions under which nitrogen and hydrogen react rapidly to 
give a high yield of ammonia. At 258C and atmospheric pressure, 
the position of the equilibrium favors the formation of NH3 
(K 5 6 3 105). Unfortunately, however, the rate of reaction is vir-
tually zero. equilibrium is reached more rapidly by raising the 
temperature. However, because the synthesis of ammonia is exo-
thermic, high temperatures reduce K and hence the yield of 
ammonia. High pressures, on the other hand, have a favorable 
eff ect on both the rate of the reaction and the position of the 
equilibrium (Table A).
The values of the equilibrium constant K listed in Table A are 
those obtained from data at low pressures, where the gases 
behave ideally. At higher pressures the mole percent of ammonia 
observed is generally larger than the calculated value. For example, 
CHeMIsTry beYOND The cLaSSrOOM
at 4008C and 300 atm, 
the observed mole per-
cent of NH3 is 47; the cal-
culated value is only 41.
The goal of Haber’s 
research was to fi nd a 
catalyst 
to 
synthesize 
ammonia at a reasonable 
rate without going to 
very high temperatures. 
These days two diff erent 
catalysts are used. One 
consists of a mixture of 
iron, potassium oxide, 
K2O, and aluminum oxide, Al2O3. The other, which uses fi nely 
divided ruthenium, ru, metal on a graphite surface, is less suscep-
tible to poisoning by impurities. reaction takes place at 4508C and 
a pressure of 200 to 600 atm. The ammonia formed is passed 
through a cooling chamber. Ammonia boils at 2338C, so it is con-
densed out as a liquid, separating it from unreacted nitrogen and 
hydrogen. The yield is typically less than 50%, so the reactants are 
recycled to produce more ammonia.
fritz haber
Haber had a distinguished scientifi c career. He received, among 
other honors, the 1918 Nobel Prize in chemistry. For more than 
20 years, he was director of the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Insti-
tute for Physical Chemistry at Dahlem, germany, a suburb of Berlin. 
Presumably because of Haber's Jewish ancestry, he was forced to 
resign that position when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. A 
contributing factor may have been his comment after listening to 
a radio broadcast of one of Hitler’s hysterical harangues. When 
asked what he thought of it, Haber replied, “give me a gun so I can 
shoot him.”
Haber, like all of us, suff ered disappointment and tragedy in his 
life. In the years after World War I, he devised a scheme to pay 
germany’s war debts by extracting gold from seawater. The 
project, which occupied Haber for several years, was a total failure

because the concentration of gold turned out to be only about one 
thousandth of the literature value.
During World War I, Haber was in charge of the German poison 
gas program. In April of 1915, the Germans used chlorine for the first 
time on the Western front, causing 5000 fatalities. Haber’s wife, 
Clara, was aghast; she pleaded with her husband to forsake poison 
gas. When he adamantly refused to do so, she committed suicide.
On a lighter note, there is an amusing anecdote told by the 
author Morris Goran (The Story of Fritz Haber, 1967). It seems that 
in a Ph.D. examination, Haber asked the candidate how iodine was 
prepared. The student made a wild guess that it was obtained from 
a tree (it isn’t). Haber played along with him, asking where the 
iodine tree grew, what it looked like, and, finally, when it bloomed. 
“In the fall,” was the answer. Haber smiled, put his arm around the 
student, and said, “Well, my friend, I’ll see you again when the 
iodine blossoms appear once more.”

mong the solution reactions considered in Chapter 4 were those between acids 
and bases. In this chapter, we take a closer look at the properties of acidic and basic 
water solutions. In particular, we examine
• the ionization of water and the equilibrium between hydrated H1 ions (H3O1 ions) and 
OH2 ions in water solution (Section 13.2).
• the quantities pH and pOH, used to describe the acidity or basicity of water solutions 
(Section 13.3).
• the types of species that act as weak acids and weak bases and the equilibria that apply 
in their water solutions (Sections 13.4 and 13.5).
• the acid-base properties of salt solutions (Section 13.6).
• the Lewis model, which expands the range of compounds that can be considered acids 
and bases (Section 13.7).
There is nothing in the Universe but 
alkali and acid,
From which Nature composes all 
things.

chapter Thirteen  Acids and Bases
13.1 Brønsted-Lowry Acid-Base Model
In Chapter 4 we considered an acid to be a substance that produces an excess of H1 ions 
in water. A base was similarly defined to be a substance that forms excess OH2 ions in 
water solution. This approach, first proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1884, is a very prac-
tical one, but it has one disadvantage. It severely limits the number of reactions that 
qualify as acid-base.
The model of acids and bases in this chapter is a somewhat more general one devel-
oped independently by Johannes Brønsted (1879–1947) in Denmark and Thomas Lowry 
(1874–1936) in England in 1923. The Brønsted-Lowry model focuses on the nature of 
acids and bases and the reactions that take place between them. Specifically, it considers 
that
•	 an acid is a proton (H1 ion) donor.
•	 a base is a proton (H1 ion) acceptor.
•	 in an acid-base reaction, a proton is transferred from an acid to a base.
A Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction might be represented as
HB(aq) 1 A2(aq) EF HA(aq) 1 B2(aq)
The species HB and HA act as Brønsted-Lowry acids in the forward and reverse reac-
tions, respectively; A2 and B2 act as Brønsted-Lowry bases.
The Brønsted-Lowry model introduces some new terminology.
1.  The species formed when a proton is removed from an acid is referred to as the 
conjugate base of that acid; B2 is the conjugate base of HB. The species formed when a 
proton is added to a base is called the conjugate acid of that base: HA is the conjugate 
acid of A2. In other words, conjugate acid-base pairs differ only in the presence or ab-
sence of a proton, H1. A conjugate acid has one more proton than its conjugate base. 
Thus we have
	
Conjugate Acid	
Conjugate Base
	
HF	
F2
	
HSO42	
SO422
	
NH41	
NH3
2.  A species that can either accept or donate a proton is referred to as amphiprotic. 
An example is the H2O molecule, which can gain a proton to form the hydronium ion, 
H3O1, or lose a proton, leaving the hydroxide ion, OH2.

(a) What is the conjugate base of HNO2? The conjugate acid of F2?
(b) The HCO32 ion, like the H2O molecule, is amphiprotic. What is its conjugate base? Its conjugate acid?
strategy
1. Form the conjugate base by removing one H atom. Decrease the charge by one unit (e.g., 21 to 22).
2. Form the conjugate acid by adding one H atom. Increase the charge by one unit (e.g., 21 to 0).

13.2  the ion product of water
13.2 The Ion Product of Water
The acidic and basic properties of aqueous solutions are dependent on an equilibrium 
that involves the solvent water. The reaction involved can be regarded as a Brønsted-
Lowry acid-base reaction in which the H2O molecule shows its amphiprotic nature:
H2O 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
Alternatively, and somewhat more simply, the reaction can be viewed as the ionization 
of a single H2O molecule:
H2O EF H1(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
Recall (Chapter 12) that in the equilibrium constant expression for reactions in solution
•	 solutes enter as their molarity, [  ].
•	 the solvent, H2O in this case, does not appear. Its concentration is essentially the same 
in all dilute solutions.
Hence for the ionization of water, the equilibrium constant expression can be 
written*
 
Kw 5 [H1][OH2]	
(13.1)
where Kw, referred to as the ion product constant of water, has a very small value. At 
258C,
 
Kw 5 1.0 3 10214	
(13.2)
This equation applies to any water solution at 258C.
The concentrations of H1 ([H1] 5 [H3O1]) ions and OH2 ions in pure water at 
258C are readily calculated from Kw. Notice from the equation for ionization that these 
two ions are formed in equal numbers. Hence in pure H2O,
[H1] 5 [OH2]
Kw 5 [H1][OH2] 5 [H1]2 5 1.0 3 10214
[H1] 5 1.0 3 1027 M 5 [OH2]
An aqueous solution in which [H1] equals [OH2] is called a neutral solution. It has an 
[H1] of 1.0 3 1027 M at 258C.
In most water solutions, the concentrations of H1 and OH2 are not equal. The equa-
tion [H1][OH2] 5 1.0 3 10214 indicates that these two quantities are inversely propor-
tional to one another (Figure 13.1). When [H1] is very high, [OH2] is very low, and vice 
versa.
An aqueous solution in which [H1] is greater than [OH2] is termed acidic. An 
aqueous solution in which [OH2] is greater than [H1] is basic (alkaline). Therefore,
if [H1] . 1.0 3 1027 M, [OH2] , 1.0 3 1027 M,        solution is acidic
if [OH2] . 1.0 3 1027 M, [H1] , 1.0 3 1027 M,        solution is basic
*For simplicity, throughout this chapter, we will use H1 rather than H3O1 in equilibrium constant expressions.
There are very few H1 and OH2 ions in 
pure water.

chapter Thirteen  Acids and Bases
13.3 pH and pOH
As just pointed out, the acidity or basicity of a solution can be described in terms of its 
H1 concentration. In 1909, Søren Sørensen (1868–1939), a biochemist working at the 
Carlsberg Brewery in Copenhagen, proposed an alternative method of specifying the 
acidity of a solution. He defined a term called pH (for “power of the hydrogen ion”):
	
pH 5 2log10[H1] 5 2log10[H3O1]	
(13.3)
or
[H1] 5 [H3O1] 5 102pH
Figure 13.2 shows the relationship between pH and [H1]. Notice that, as the defin-
ing equation implies, pH increases by one unit when the concentration of H1 decreases 
by a power of 10. Moreover, the higher the pH, the less acidic the solution. Most aqueous 
solutions have hydrogen ion concentrations between 1 and 10214 M and hence have a pH 
between 0 and 14.
The pH, like [H1] or [OH2], can be used to differentiate acidic, neutral, and basic 
solutions. At 258C,
	
if pH , 7.0,        solution is acidic
if pH 5 7.0,        solution is neutral
	
if pH . 7.0,        solution is basic
It is simpler to use numbers  (pH 5 4) 
than exponents ([H1] 5 1024 M) to 
describe acidity.

chapter Thirteen  Acids and Bases
The number calculated in part (b) for the concentration of H1 in blood, 4.0 3 1028 M, 
is very small. You may wonder what difference it makes whether [H1] is 4.0 3 1028 M, 
4.0 3 1027 M, or some other such tiny quantity. In practice, it makes a great deal of dif-
ference because a large number of biological processes involve H1 as a reactant, so the 
rates of these processes depend on its concentration. If [H1] increases from 4.0 3 1028 M 
to 4.0 3 1027 M, the rate of a first-order reaction involving H1 increases by a factor of 10. 
Indeed, if [H1] in blood increases by a much smaller amount, from 4.0 3 1028 M to 
5.0 3 1028 M (pH 7.40 9: 7.30), a condition called acidosis develops. The nervous 
system is depressed; fainting and even coma can result.

Measuring pH
The pH of a solution can be measured by an instrument called a pH meter. A pH meter 
translates the H1 ion concentration of a solution into an electrical signal that is converted 
into either a digital display or a deflection on a meter that reads pH directly (Figure 13.4). 
Later, in Chapter 17, we will consider the principle on which the pH meter works.
A less accurate but more colorful way to measure pH uses a universal indicator, 
which is a mixture of acid-base indicators that shows changes in color at different pH 
values (Figure 13.5). A similar principle is used with pH paper. Strips of this paper are 
coated with a mixture of pH-sensitive dyes; these strips are widely used to test the pH of 
biological fluids, groundwater, and foods. Depending on the indicators used, a test strip 
can measure pH over a wide or narrow range.
Charles D. Winters
Figure 13.5 pH as shown by a universal indicator. Universal indicator is deep red in 
strongly acidic solution (upper left). It changes to yellow and green at pH 6 to 8, and then 
to deep violet in strongly basic solution (lower right).
One type of paper, pH paper, is also 
known as litmus paper.
The color change of hydrangeas is ex-
actly the opposite of that for litmus.

Figure 13.6 Influence of acidic 
or basic soil. Hydrangeas grown in 
strongly acidic soil (below pH 5) are

basic soil, the flowers are rosy pink.
Home gardeners frequently measure and adjust soil pH in an effort to improve the 
yield and quality of grass, vegetables, and flowers. Interestingly enough, the colors of 
many flowers depend on pH; among these are dahlias, delphiniums, and, in particular, 
hydrangeas (Figure 13.6). The first research in this area was carried out by Robert 
Boyle of gas-law fame, who published a paper on the relation between flower color and 
acidity in 1664.

chapter Thirteen  Acids and Bases
13.4 Weak Acids and Their Equilibrium 
Constants
Many solutes behave as weak acids; that is, they react reversibly with water to form H3O1 
ions. Using HB to represent a weak acid, its Brønsted-Lowry reaction with water is
HB(aq) 1 H2O 9: H3O1(aq) 1 B2(aq)
Typically, this reaction occurs to a very small extent; usually, fewer than 1% of the HB 
molecules are converted to ions.
Most weak acids fall into one of two categories:
1.  Molecules containing an ionizable hydrogen atom. This type of weak acid was 
discussed in Chapter 4. There are literally thousands of molecular weak acids, most of 
them organic in nature. Among the molecular inorganic weak acids is nitrous acid:
HNO2(aq) 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 NO22(aq)
2.  Cations. The ammonium ion, NH41, behaves as a weak acid in water; a 0.10 M 
solution of NH4Cl has a pH of about 5. The process by which the NH41 ion lowers the 
pH of water can be represented by the (Brønsted-Lowry) equation:
NH41(aq) 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 NH3(aq)
Comparing this equation with the one above for HNO2, you can see that they are very 
similar. In both cases, a weak acid (HNO2, NH41) is converted to its conjugate base 
(NO22, NH3). The fact that the NH41 ion has a 11 charge, whereas the HNO2 molecule 
is neutral, is really irrelevant here.
You may be surprised to learn that many metal cations act as weak acids in water 
solution. A 0.10 M solution of Al2(SO4)3 has a pH close to 3; you can change the color of 
hydrangeas from red to blue by adding aluminum salts to soil. At first glance it is not at 
all obvious how a cation such as Al31 can make a water solution acidic. However, the 
aluminum cation in water solution is really a hydrated species, Al(H2O)631, in which six 
water molecules are bonded to the central Al31 ion. This species can transfer a proton to 
a solvent water molecule to form an H3O1 ion:
Al(H2O)631(aq) 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 Al(H2O)5(OH)21(aq)
Figure 13.7 shows the structures of the Al(H2O)631 cation and its conjugate base, 
Al(H2O)5(OH)21.
A very similar equation can explain why solutions of zinc salts are acidic. Here it 
appears that the hydrated cation in water solution contains four H2O molecules bonded 
to a central Zn21 ion. The Brønsted-Lowry equation is
Zn(H2O)421(aq) 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 Zn(H2O)3(OH)1(aq)
You can assume that all common acids 
other than HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, HClO4, 
and H2SO4 are weak.
To get red hydrangeas, add lime (CaO).
All transition metal cations behave  
this way.

13.4  weak acids and their equilibrium constants
The Equilibrium Constant for a Weak Acid
In discussing the equilibrium involved when a weak acid is added to water, it is conve-
nient to represent the proton transfer
HB(aq) 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 B2(aq)
as a simple ionization
HB(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 B2(aq)
in which case the expression for the equilibrium constant becomes
	
Ka 5  3H143B24
3HB4
	
(13.5)
The equilibrium constant Ka is called, logically enough, the acid equilibrium con-
stant of the weak acid HB. Table 13.2 lists the Ka values of some weak acids in order of 
decreasing strength. The weaker the acid, the smaller the value of Ka. For example, HCN 
(Ka 5 5.8 3 10210) is a weaker acid than HNO2, for which Ka 5 6.0 3 1024.

strategy and solution
1. To prove that a species is acidic, you must produce a hydronium ion (H3O1) obtained by transferring an H atom 
to water.

2. For the hydrated cation, one of the water molecules in the ion donates an H atom to an unattached water molecule. 
Think of Zn(H2O)421 as Zn(H2O)(H2O)321.

you can solve for [H1] quite simply, as in Example 13.7, where x 5 0.012a. Sometimes, 
though, you will find that the calculated [H1] is greater than 5% of the original concen-

•  much smaller than the original concentration of the weak acid, 0.10 M. In this case, then, the approximation 0.10 2 x  
0.10 is justified. This will usually, but not always, be the case (see Example 13.8).
•  much larger than [H1] in pure water, 1 3 1027 M, justifying the assumption that the ionization of water can be neglected. 
This will always be the case, provided [H1] from the weak acid is ≥ 1026 M.

13.4  weak acids and their equilibrium constants
Polyprotic Weak Acids
Certain weak acids are polyprotic; they contain more than one ionizable hydrogen 
atom. Such acids ionize in steps, with a separate equilibrium constant for each step. Ox-
alic acid, a weak organic acid sometimes used to remove bloodstains, is diprotic:
	
H2C2O4(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 HC2O42(aq)        Ka1 5 5.9 3 1022
	
HC2O42(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 C2O422(aq)	
Ka2 5 5.2 3 1025
Phosphoric acid, a common ingredient of cola drinks, is triprotic:
	
H3PO4(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 H2PO42(aq)	
Ka1 5 7.1 3 1023
H2PO42(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 HPO422(aq)        Ka2 5 6.2 3 1028
	
HPO422(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 PO432(aq)	
Ka3 5 4.5 3 10213
The behavior of these acids is typical of all polyprotic acids in that
•	 the anion formed in one step (e.g., HC2O42, H2PO42) produces another H1 ion in the 
next step.
•	 the acid equilibrium constant becomes smaller with each successive step.
Ka1 . Ka2 . Ka3
Putting it another way, the acids in successive steps become progressively weaker. This is 
reasonable; it should be more difficult to remove a positively charged proton, H1, from 
a negatively charged species like H2PO42 than from a neutral molecule like H3PO4.

Ordinarily, successive values of Ka for polyprotic acids decrease by a factor of at 
least 100 (Table 13.3). In that case, essentially all the H1 ions in the solution come 
from the first step. This makes it relatively easy to calculate the pH of a solution of a 
polyprotic acid.

Molecular Structure and Acid Strength
Equilibrium constants, Ka, are a measure of the strength of an acid. The values range 
from 0.010 to 1 3 10213. What is responsible for this variation?
As we saw earlier, a Brønsted-­Lowry acid is a proton donor. The strength of the acid 
depends on how easily the bond between hydrogen and another atom is broken and how 
many of the H1 ions are donated. So, as you might suspect, the stronger the bond, the 
weaker the acid because the more tightly the hydrogen atom is held, the less likely it is to 
come off.
For oxoacids—where hydrogen is bonded to oxygen, which in turn is bonded to 
some other atom—two other factors affect the strength of the acid. Those are the electro-
negativity of the nonmetal to which the oxygen atoms are bonded and the number of 
oxygen atoms bonded to the nonmetal. The more electronegative the nonmetal bonded 
to oxygen is, the more it polarizes and therefore weakens the O!H bond, resulting in a 
larger equilibrium constant. Increasing the number of oxygen atoms bonded to the non-
metal also weakens the O!H bond, resulting in a stronger acid. HClO is a much weaker 
acid than HClO2, whereas HClO4 is a strong acid. The acidity of oxoacids is discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 21.
13.5 Weak Bases and Their Equilibrium 
Constants
Like the weak acids, a large number of solutes act as weak bases. It is convenient to clas-
sify weak bases into two groups, molecules and anions.
1.  Molecules. As pointed out in Chapter 4, there are many molecular weak bases, 
including the organic compounds known as amines. The simplest weak base is ammo-
nia, whose reversible Brønsted-Lowry reaction with water is represented by the 
equation
NH3(aq) 1 H2O EF NH41(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
This reaction proceeds to only a very small extent. In 0.10 M NH3, the concentrations of 
NH41 and OH2 are only about 0.0013 M.
2.  Anions. An anion derived from a weak acid is itself a weak base. A typical ex-
ample is the fluoride ion, F2, which is the conjugate base of the weak acid HF. The reac-
tion of the F2 ion with water is
F2(aq) 1 H2O EF HF(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
The OH2 ions formed make the solution basic. A 0.10 M solution of sodium fluoride, 
NaF, has a pH of about 8.1.

chapter Thirteen  Acids and Bases
Notice the similarity between the equation just written and that for the NH3 mole-
cule cited above
•	 both weak bases (NH3, F2) accept protons to form the conjugate acid (NH41, HF).
•	 water acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid in each case, donating a proton to form the 
OH2 ion.

strategy
1. React each basic anion with a water molecule.
2. The weak base picks up the proton (H1) and increases its charge by one unit to create its conjugate acid.
3. OH2 is the other product of the reaction.

The presence of OH2 as a product is the reason these anions in water are considered to be basic.
The Equilibrium Constant for a Weak Base
For the weak base ammonia
NH3(aq) 1 H2O EF NH41(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
the base equilibrium constant is written in the usual way, omitting the term for solvent 
water.
Kb 5 
3NH4
 14 3 3OH24
3NH34
For an anion B2 that acts as a weak base,
B2(aq) 1 H2O EF HB(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
a very similar expression can be written:
	
Kb 5 
3HB4 3 3OH24
3B24
	
(13.8)
Values of Kb are listed at the right of Table 13.2. The larger the value of Kb, the stron-
ger the base. Because Kb for NH3 (1.8 3 1025) is larger than Kb for C2H3O22 (5.6 3 10210), 
ammonia is a stronger base than the acetate ion.

Calculation of [OH2] in a Water Solution of a Weak 
Base
We showed in Section 13.4 how Ka of a weak acid can be used to calculate [H1] in a 
solution of that acid. In a very similar way, Kb can be used to find [OH2] in a solution 
of a weak base.

chapter Thirteen  Acids and Bases
Relation Between Ka and Kb
Equilibrium constants of weak bases can be measured in the laboratory by procedures 
very much like those used for weak acids. In practice, though, it is simpler to take advan-
tage of a simple mathematical relationship between Kb for a weak base and Ka for its 
conjugate acid. This relationship can be derived by adding together the equations for the 
ionization of the weak acid HB and the reaction of the weak base B2 with water:

From the general relation between Ka of a weak acid and Kb of its conjugate weak 
base, it should be clear that these two quantities are inversely related to each other. The 
larger the value of Ka, the smaller the value of Kb and vice versa. Table 13.4 shows this effect 
and some other interesting features. In particular,
	 1.	 Brønsted-Lowry acids (left column) can be divided into three categories:
	 	 (a)	 strong acids (HClO4, . . .), which are stronger proton donors than the H3O1 ion.
	 	 (b)	 weak acids (HF, . . .), which are weaker proton donors than the H3O1 ion, but 
stronger than the H2O molecule.
  (c)	 species such as C2H5OH, which are weaker proton donors than the H2O mol-
ecule and hence do not form acidic water solutions.
	 2.	 Brønsted-Lowry bases (right column) can be divided similarly:
  (a)	 strong bases (H2, . . .), which are stronger proton acceptors than the OH2 ion.
	 	 (b)	 weak bases (F2, . . .), which are weaker proton acceptors than the OH2 ion, but 
stronger than the H2O molecule.
	 	 (c)	 the anions of strong acids (ClO42, . . .), which are weaker proton acceptors than 
the H2O molecule and hence do not form basic water solutions.
We should point out that, just as the three strong acids at the top of Table 13.4 are 
completely converted to H3O1 ions in aqueous solution:
HClO4(aq) 1 H2O 9: H3O1(aq) 1 ClO42(aq)

Hydride ion–water reaction. As 
water is dropped onto solid calcium 
hydride, the hydride ion (H2) reacts im-
mediately and vigorously to form H2(g) 
(which is ignited by the heat of the 
reaction) and OH2.

the three strong bases at the bottom of the table are completely converted to

In other words, the species H2, O22, and C2H5O2 do not exist in water solution.
13.6 Acid-Base Properties of Salt Solutions
A salt is an ionic solid containing a cation other than H1 and an anion other than OH2 
or O22. When a salt such as NaCl, K2CO3, or Al(NO3)3 dissolves in water, the cation and 
anion separate from one another.
	
NaCl(s) 9: Na1(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)
	
K2CO3(s) 9: 2K1(aq) 1 CO322(aq)
Al(NO3)3(s) 9: Al31(aq) 1 3NO32(aq)
To predict whether a given salt solution will be acidic, basic, or neutral, you consider 
three factors in turn.
	 1.	 Decide what effect, if any, the cation has on the pH of water.
	 2.	 Decide what effect, if any, the anion has on the pH of water.
 3. Combine the two effects to decide on the behavior of the salt.
Cations: Weak Acids or Spectator Ions?
As we pointed out in Section 13.4, certain cations act as weak acids in water solution 
because of reactions such as
	
NH41(aq) 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 NH3(aq)
Zn(H2O)421(aq) 1 H2O EF H3O1(aq) 1 Zn(H2O)3(OH)1(aq)
Essentially all transition metal ions behave like Zn21, forming a weakly acidic solution. 
Among the main-group cations, Al31 and, to a lesser extent, Mg21, act as weak acids. In 
contrast the cations in Group 1 show little or no tendency to react with water.
If we say that to classify an ion as acidic or basic in water solution, it must change 
the pH by more than 0.5 unit in 0.1 M solution, then the cations derived from strong 
bases are:
•	 the alkali metal cations (Li1, Na1, K1  .  .  .  )
•	 the heavier alkaline earth cations (Ca21, Sr21, Ba21)
are spectator ions as far as pH is concerned (Table 13.5).
Charles D. Winters
Sodium chloride solution. When the 
NaCl is completely dissolved, the solu-
tion will contain only Na1, Cl2, and H2O, 
and it is neither acidic nor basic.

13.6  acid-base properties of salt solutions
Anions: Weak Bases or Spectator Ions?
As pointed out in Section 13.5, anions that are the conjugate bases of weak acids act themselves 
as weak bases in water. They accept a proton from a water molecule, leaving an OH2 ion that 
makes the solution basic. The reactions of the fluoride and carbonate ions are typical:

Most anions behave this way, except those derived from strong acids (Cl2, Br2, I2, 
NO32, ClO42), which show little or no tendency to react with water to form OH2 ions. 
Like the cations in the left column of Table 13.5, they act as spectator ions as far as pH is 
concerned. You can also use the flowchart shown in Figure 13.9.
Salts: Acidic, Basic, or Neutral?
If you know how the cation and anion of a salt affect the pH of water, it is a relatively 
simple matter to decide what the net effect will be (see the flowchart in Figure 13.9).

13.7 Extending the Concept of Acids and Bases: 
The Lewis Model
We have seen that the Brønsted-­Lowry model extends the Arrhenius picture of acid-­base 
reactions considerably. However, the Brønsted-­Lowry model is restricted in one impor-
tant respect. It can be applied only to reactions involving a proton transfer. For a species 
to act as a Brønsted-­Lowry acid, it must contain an ionizable hydrogen atom.
The Lewis acid-­base model removes that restriction. A Lewis acid is a species that 
in an acid-­base reaction, accepts an electron pair. In this reaction, a Lewis base donates 
the electron pair.
From a structural point of view, the Lewis model of a base does not differ in any es-
sential way from the Brønsted-­Lowry model. For a species to accept a proton and there-
by act as a Brønsted-­Lowry base, it must possess an unshared pair of electrons. Consider, 
example 13.12
Consider aqueous solutions of the following salts:
(a) Zn(NO3)2    (b)  KClO4    (c)  Na3PO4    (d)  NH4F    (e)  NaHCO3
Which of theses solutions are acidic? basic? neutral?

13.7  EXTENDING the concept of acids and bases: the lewis model
for example, the NH3 molecule, the H2O molecule, and the F2 ion, all of which can act 
as Brønsted-Lowry bases:
H
F
H9O9H
H9N9H
(
−)
Each of these species contains an unshared pair of electrons to form the NH41 ion, the 
H3O1 ion, or the HF molecule:
H
H
H
H9F
H9O9H +
H9N9H  
(
(
+
Clearly, NH3, H2O, and F2 can also be Lewis bases because they possess an unshared 
electron pair that can be donated to an acid. We see then that the Lewis model does not 
significantly change the number of species that can behave as bases.
On the other hand, the Lewis model greatly increases the number of species that can 
be considered to be acids. The substance that accepts an electron pair and therefore acts 
as a Lewis acid can be a proton:
	
H1(aq) 1 H2O !: H3O1(aq)
	
acid	
base
	
H1(aq) 1 NH3(aq) !: NH41(aq)
	
acid	
base
It can equally well be a cation such as Zn21, which can accept electron pairs from a Lewis base:
	
Zn21(aq) 1 4H2O !: Zn(H2O)421(aq)
	
acid	
base
	
Zn21(aq) 1 4NH3(aq) !: Zn(NH3)421(aq)
	
acid	
base
We will discuss reactions of this type in more detail in Chapters 15 and 19.
Another important class of Lewis acids are molecules containing an incomplete octet 
of electrons. A classic example is boric acid, an antiseptic sometimes found in eyewashes.
O
H
H9O9B9O9H
When boric acid is added to water, it acts as a Lewis acid, picking up an OH2 to complete 
the boron octet and at the same time liberating a proton.
B(OH)3(s) 1 H2O !: B(OH)42(aq) 1 H1(aq)

The Lewis model is commonly used in chemistry to consider the catalytic behavior 
of such Lewis acids as ZnCl2 and BF3. In general, when proton transfer reactions are in-
volved, most chemists use the Arrhenius or Brønsted-­Lowry models. Table 13.6 sum-
marizes the acid-­base models we have discussed.

chapter thirteen  Acids and Bases
Organic Acids and Bases
as pointed out earlier in this chapter, most molecular weak acids are 
organic in nature; they contain carbon as well as hydrogen atoms. By 
the same token, most molecular weak bases are organic compounds 
called amines, which were discussed briefl y in Chapter 4.
Carboxylic Acids
Table a lists some of the organic acids found in foods. all of these 
compounds contain the carboxyl group
9C9O9H
O
The general equation for the reversible dissociation of a carboxylic 
acid is
rCOOH(aq) EF rCOO2(aq) 1 H1(aq)
where r is a hydrocarbon group such as CH3, C2H5, . . . . The reac-
tion of a carboxylic acid with a strong base can be represented by 
the equation
rCOOH(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: rCOO2(aq) 1 H2O
This reaction, as is the case with all weak acids, goes essentially to 
completion.
Certain drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, 
contain organic acids. Two of the most popular products of this 
type are the analgesics aspirin and ibuprofen (advil®, Nuprin®, 
and so on).

Because these compounds are acidic, they can cause stomach 
irritation unless taken with food or water. Beyond that, aspirin in-
hibits blood clotting, which explains why it is often prescribed to 
reduce the likelihood of a stroke or heart attack. Indeed, it is now 
recommended for a person in the throes of a heart attack.
Amines
an amine is a derivative of ammonia, NH3, in which one or more of the 
hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a hydrocarbon group 
(e.g., CH3, C2H5). amines can be classifi ed according to the number 
(1, 2, or 3) of hydrocarbon groups bonded to nitrogen (Table B, page 
429). Most amines of low molar mass are volatile with distinctly un-
pleasant odors. For example, (CH3)3N is a gas at room temperature 
(bp 5 38C) with an odor somewhere between those of ammonia and 
spoiled fi sh.
The general equation for the reaction of a primary amine with 
water is
rNH2(aq) 1 H2O EF rNH31(aq) 1 OH2(aq)
while its reaction with strong acid is
rNH2(aq) 1 H1(aq) 9: rNH31(aq)

  KEY CONCEPTS
Secondary and tertiary amines react similarly, forming cations of 
general formula R2NH21 and R3NH1. In each case the added proton 
bonds to the unshared pair on the nitrogen atom. (Compare 
RNH31, R2NH21 and R3NH1 with the ammonium ion, NH41.)
The reaction of amines with H1 ions has an interesting practical 
application. Amines of high molar mass, frequently used as drugs, 
have very low water solubilities. They can be converted to a water-
soluble form by treatment with strong acid. For example,
C9H10NO29N9C2H5(s) + HCl(aq)
C2H5
novocaine
[C9H10NO29N9C2H5]+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
H
C2H5
novocaine hydrochloride
Novocaine hydrochloride is about 200 times as soluble as novo-
caine itself. When your dentist injects “novocaine,” the liquid in the 
syringe is a water solution of novocaine hydrochloride.
Alkaloids such as caffeine, coniine, and morphine (Figure A) are 
amines that are extracted from plants.

Caffeine occurs in tea leaves, coffee beans, and cola nuts. Morphine

from hemlock, is the alkaloid that killed Socrates. He was sen-
tenced to death because of unconventional teaching methods; 
teacher evaluations had teeth in them in ancient Greece.

n Chapter 13 we dealt with the equilibrium established when a single solute, either a 
weak acid or a weak base, is added to water. This chapter focuses on the equilibrium 
established when two different solutes are mixed in water solution. These solutes may be
• a weak acid, HB, and its conjugate base, B2. Solutions called buffers contain roughly 
equal amounts of these two species. The equilibria involved in buffer solutions are 
considered in Section 14.1.
• an acid and a base used in an acid-base titration. This type of reaction was dis-
cussed in Chapter 4. Section 14.3 examines the equilibria involved, the way pH changes 
during the titration, and the choice of indicator for the titration.
We will also consider the equilibrium involved in using an acid-base indicator to 
estimate pH (Section 14.2).

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
14.1 Buffers
Any solution containing appreciable amounts of both a weak acid and its conjugate base
•	 is highly resistant to changes in pH brought about by addition of strong acid or 
strong base.
•	 has a pH close to the pKa of the weak acid.
A solution with these properties is called a buffer, because it cushions the “shock” (i.e., 
the drastic change in pH) that occurs when a strong acid or strong base is added to water.
To prepare a buffer, we can mix solutions of a weak acid HB and the sodium salt of 
that acid NaB, which consists of Na1 and B2 ions. This mixture can react with either a 
strong base
HB(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: B2(aq) 1 H2O
or a strong acid
B2(aq) 1 H1(aq) 9: HB(aq)
These reactions have very large equilibrium constants, as we will see in Section 14.3, 
and so go virtually to completion. As a result, the added H1 or OH2 ions are consumed and 
do not directly affect the pH. This is the principle of buffer action, which explains why a 
buffered solution is much more resistant to a change in pH than one that is unbuffered 
(Figure 14.1).
Figure 14.1 The effect of a buffer 
upon addition of acid. Note the read-
ing on the pH meter.
By definition, a buffer is any solution 
that resists a change in pH.
Both beakers contain distilled water.
After the addition of 20 mL of 0.30 M HCl, the pH of the
water has dropped signiﬁcantly.
Both beakers contain a pH 4 buﬀer.
Addition of the same volume of 0.30 M HCl to the buﬀer
has barely changed the pH.

14.1  buffers
Buffers are widely used to maintain nearly constant pH in a variety of commercial 
products and laboratory procedures (Figure 14.2). For these applications and others, it is 
essential to be able to determine
•	 the pH of a buffer system made by mixing a weak acid with its conjugate base.
•	 the appropriate buffer system to maintain a desired pH.
•	 the (small) change in pH that occurs when a strong acid or base is added to a buffer.
•	 the capacity of a buffer to absorb H1 or OH2 ions.
Determination of [H1] in a Buffer System
The concentration of H1 ion in a buffer can be calculated if you know the concentrations 
of the weak acid HB and its conjugate base B2. These three quantities are related through 
the acid equilibrium constant of HB:
HB(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 B2(aq)    Ka 5 3H143B24
3HB4
Solving for [H1],
 
[H1] 5 Ka 3  3HB4
3B24  
(14.1)
By taking the logarithm of both sides of Equation 14.1 and multiplying through by 21, 
you can show (Problem 79) that, for any buffer system, 
pH 5 pKa 1 log10 3B24
3HB4
This relation, known as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, is often used in biology 
and biochemistry to calculate the pH of buffers. Historically, it was Henderson who “dis-
covered” Equation 14.1 in 1908. Hasselbalch put it in logarithmic form eight years later.
Equation 14.1 is a completely general equation, applicable to all buffer systems. The 
calculation of [H1]—and hence pH—can be simplified if you keep two points in mind:
1.  You can always assume that equilibrium is established without appreciably 
changing the original concentrations of either HB or B2. That is,
[HB] 5 [HB]o
[B2] 5 [B2]o
To explain why these relations hold, consider, for example, what happens when the weak 
acid HB is added to water:
HB(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 B2(aq)

of buffers. Many products, including

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
We saw in Chapter 13 that under these conditions, it is usually a good approximation to

Lactic acid, C3H6O3, is a weak organic acid present in both sour milk and buttermilk. It is also a product of carbohydrate 
metabolism and is found in the blood after vigorous muscular activity. A buffer is prepared by dissolving lactic acid, HLac 
(Ka ​5 ​1.4 ​3 ​1024), and sodium lactate, NaC3H5O3, NaLac. Calculate [H1] and the pH of the buffer if it is made of

14.1  buffers
Notice in Example 14.1(a) that the total volume of solution is irrelevant. All that is 
required to solve for [H1] is the number of moles of lactic acid and sodium lactate. The 
pH of the buffer is 3.85 whether the volume of solution is 550 mL, 1 L, or even 10 L. This 
explains why diluting a buffer with water does not change the pH.

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
	 1.	 The acid equilibrium constant of the weak acid, Ka. The value of Ka has the greatest 
influence on buffer pH. Because HB and B2 are likely to be present in nearly equal 
amounts,
[H1] < Ka        pH < pKa
Thus to make up a buffer with a pH close to 7, you should use a conjugate weak acid–
weak base pair in which Ka of the weak acid is about 1027.
	 2.	 The ratio of the concentrations or amounts of HB and B2. Small variations in pH 
can be achieved by adjusting this ratio. To obtain a slightly more acidic buffer, add 
more weak acid, HB; addition of more weak base, B2, will make the buffer a bit 
more basic.

14.1  buffers
As Example 14.2 suggests, the most common way to prepare buffers is by mixing a 
weak acid and its conjugate base. However, a somewhat different approach is also pos-
sible: partial neutralization of a weak acid or a weak base gives a buffer. To illustrate, 
suppose that 0.18 mol of HCl is added to 0.28 mol of NH3. The following reaction 
occurs:
H1(aq) 1 NH3(aq) 9: NH41(aq)
The limiting reactant, H1, is consumed. Hence we have

The solution formed contains appreciable amounts of both NH41 and NH3. It is a buffer. 
As we saw in Example 14.2, when the ratio [NH41]/[NH3] is 1.8, the pH of the buffer is 9.00.
In buffers, the limiting reactant is always the reactant with the smaller number of 
moles because the ratio of reactants to products is always 1.

pH of the buffer after the addition of acid
These tubes show the eﬀect of adding a 
few drops of strong acid or strong base 
to water. The pH changes drastically, 
giving a pronounced color change with 
universal indicator.
The experiment is repeated in these 
tubes using a buﬀer of pH 7 instead of 
water. This time the pH changes only 
very slightly, and there is no change in 
color of the indicator. 
Effect of Added H1 or OH2 on Buffer Systems
The pH of a buffer does change slightly on addition of moderate amounts of a strong acid 
or strong base. Addition of H1 ions converts an equal amount of weak base B2 to its 
conjugate acid HB:
H1(aq) 1 B2(aq) 9: HB(aq)
By the same token, addition of OH2 ions converts an equal amount of weak acid to its 
conjugate base B2:
HB(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: B2(aq) 1 H2O
In either case, the ratio nHB/nB2 changes. This in turn changes the H1 ion concentration 
and pH of the buffer. The effect ordinarily is small, as Example 14.4 illustrates.
A buffer “works” because it contains 
species (HB and B2) that react with 
both H1 and OH2.

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
Example 14.4 shows, among other things, how effectively a buffer “soaks up” H1 or 
OH2 ions. That can be important. Suppose you are carrying out a reaction whose rate is 
first-order in H1. If the pH increases from 5 to 7, perhaps by the absorption of traces of 
ammonia from the air, the rate will decrease by a factor of 100. A reaction that should 
have been complete in three hours will still be going on when you come back ten days 
later. Small wonder that chemists frequently work with buffered solutions to avoid disas-
ters of that type.
Buffer Capacity and Buffer Range
A buffer has a limited capacity to react with H1 or OH2 ions without undergoing a dras-
tic change in pH. To see why this is the case, consider Figure 14.3, which applies to the  
H2CO3–HCO32 buffer system (Ka H2CO3 5 4 3 1027).
To interpret Figure 14.3, it is important to realize that the capacity of a buffer to ab-
sorb added OH2 or H1 ions is inversely related to the slope of the curve. Notice that
•	 at point A where
pH 5 pKa H2CO3 5 6.4
	
the slope is very small and the buffer has its maximum capacity to absorb OH2 or H1 
ions without a drastic change in pH.
end points
1. Adding a strong acid to a buffer
•  ​increases the number of moles of the weak acid.
•  ​decreases the number of moles of the conjugate base.
•  ​decreases the pH by a small amount. (In this case: 3.85 !: 3.80)
2. Adding a strong base to a buffer
•  ​increases the number of moles of the conjugate base.
•  ​decreases the number of moles of the weak acid.
•  ​increases the pH by a small amount. (In this case: 3.85 !: 3.92)
3. One cannot add an unlimited amount of strong acid or base. When the weak acid or its conjugate base becomes the lim-
iting reactant, then the buffer is destroyed and only H1 and the weak acid are present (if H1 is added) or OH2 and the 
weak base are left (if OH2 is added).

curve to the right shows how  
pH increases as OH2 is added.

14.2  acid-base indicators
•	 at point B, where
pH 5 7.4;        [HCO32] 5 10 3 [H2CO3]
	
the slope is very large. Very few H2CO3 molecules are left, so the buffer has lost its 
capacity to absorb more OH2 ions.
•	 at point C, where
pH 5 5.4;        [H2CO3] 5 10 3 [HCO32]
	
the pH is dropping off precipitously. Very few HCO32 ions are left, so the buffer has 
lost its capacity to absorb added H1 ions.
Blood is buffered at pH 7.4, in part by the H2CO3–HCO32 system. As you can see 
from Figure 14.3 and the above discussion, that puts us at point B on the curve. We con-
clude that blood has very little capacity to absorb OH2 ions (moving to the right of 
point B) but a large capacity to absorb H1 ions (moving to the left of point B). This is 
indeed fortunate because life processes produce many more H1 ions than OH2 ions.
The buffer range is the pH range over which the buffer is effective. It is related to 
the ratio of concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base. The further the ratio 
is from 1, the less effective the buffering action. Ideally, the acid/base ratio should be 
between 0.1 and 10. Since log10 10 5 1 and log10 0.1 5 21, buffers are most useful within 
61 pH unit of the pKa of the weak acid.
14.2 Acid-Base Indicators
As pointed out in Chapter 4, an acid-base indicator is useful in determining the equiva-
lence point of an acid-base titration. This is the point at which reaction is complete; 
equivalent quantities of acid and base have reacted. If the indicator is chosen properly, the 
point at which it changes color (its end point) coincides with the equivalence point. To 
It’s called an end point because that’s 
when you stop the titration.

(14.3)
From this expression, it follows that the ratio [HIn]/[In2] and hence the color of an in-
dicator depends on two factors.
	 1.	 [H1] or the pH of the solution. At high [H1] (low pH), you see the color of the HIn 
molecule; at low [H1] (high pH), the color of the In2 ion dominates.
	 2.	 Ka of the indicator. Because Ka varies from one indicator to another, different indi-
cators change colors at different pHs. A color change occurs when
[H1] < Ka        pH < pKa
Table 14.2 shows the characteristics of three indicators: methyl red, bromthymol 
blue, and phenolphthalein. These indicators change colors at pH 5, 7, and 9, 
respectively.
In practice it is usually possible to detect an indicator color change over a range of 
about two pH units. Consider, for example, what happens with bromthymol blue as the 
pH increases:
•	 below pH 6 (e.g.,  .  .  .  3, 4, 5) the color is pure yellow.
•	 between pH 6 and 7, the indicator starts to take on a greenish tinge; we might de-
scribe its color as yellow-green.
•	 at pH 7, the color is a 50–50 mixture of yellow and blue so it looks green.
•	 between pH 7 and 8, a blue color becomes visible.
•	 above pH 8 (or 9, 10, 11,  .  .  .) the color is pure blue.

14.3 Acid-Base Titrations
The discussion of acid-base titrations in Chapter 4 focused on stoichiometry. Here, the 
emphasis is on the equilibrium principles that apply to the acid-base reactions involved. 
It is convenient to distinguish between titrations involving
•	 a strong acid (e.g., HCl) and a strong base (e.g., NaOH, Ba(OH)2).
•	 a weak acid (e.g., HC2H3O2) and a strong base (e.g., NaOH).
•	 a strong acid (e.g., HCl) and a weak base (e.g., NH3).
Strong Acid–Strong Base
As pointed out in Chapter 13, strong acids ionize completely in water to form H3O1 ions; 
strong bases dissolve in water to form OH2 ions. The neutralization reaction that takes 
place when any strong acid reacts with any strong base can be represented by a net ionic 
equation of the Brønsted-Lowry type:
H3O1(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: 2H2O
or, more simply, substituting H1 ions for H3O1 ions, as
H1(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: H2O
The equation just written is the reverse of that for the ionization of water, so the equilib-
rium constant can be calculated by using the reciprocal rule (Chapter 12).
K 5 1/Kw 5 1/(1.0 3 10214) 5 1.0 3 1014
The enormous value of K means that for all practical purposes this reaction goes to 
completion, consuming the limiting reactant, H1 or OH2.
Consider now what happens when HCl, a typical strong acid, is titrated with NaOH. 
Figure 14.5 shows how the pH changes during the titration. Two features of this curve are 
of particular importance:
	 1.	 At the equivalence point, when all the HCl has been neutralized by NaOH, a solu-
tion of NaCl, a neutral salt, is present. The pH at the equivalence point is 7.
	 2.	 Near the equivalence point, the pH rises very rapidly. Indeed, the pH may increase 
by as much as six units (from 4 to 10) when half a drop, < 0.02 mL, of NaOH is 
added (Example 14.7).

three indicators, methyl red (MR, end

14.3  acid-base titrations
From Figure 14.5 and Example 14.7, we conclude that any indicator that changes 
color between pH 4 and 10 should be satisfactory for a strong acid–strong base titration. 
Brom­thymol blue (BB: end point pH 5 7) would work very well, but so would methyl 
red (MR: end point pH 5 5) or phenolphthalein (PP: end point pH 5 9).
Weak Acid–Strong Base
A typical weak acid–strong base titration is that of acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. 
The net ionic equation for the reaction is
HC2H3O2(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: C2H3O22(aq) 1 H2O
Notice that this reaction is the reverse of the reaction of the weak base C2H3O22 (the 
acetate ion) with water (Chapter 13). It follows from the reciprocal rule that for this 
reaction,

Note that half a drop before the end point (pH 5 7) is reached, the pH is 3.8. When half a drop is added after the end point 
is reached, the end point changes from 7 to 10. This is predicted by Figure 14.5.
For an effective titration, the reaction 
must go to completion, which requires

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
Here again, K is a very large number; the reaction of acetic acid with a strong base goes 
essentially to completion.
Figure 14.6 shows how the pH changes as fifty milliliters of one molar acetic acid is 
titrated with one molar sodium hydroxide. Notice that
•	 the pH starts off above 2; we are dealing with a weak acid, HC2H3O2.
•	 there is a region, centered at the halfway point of the titration, where pH changes 
very slowly. The solution contains equal amounts of unreacted HC2H3O2 and its con-
jugate base, C2H3O22, formed by reaction with NaOH. As pointed out earlier, such a 
system acts as a buffer. Figure 14.7 shows how [H1] 5 Ka at half-neutralization.
•	 at the equivalence point, there is a solution of sodium acetate, NaC2H3O2. The acetate 
ion is a weak base, so the pH at the equivalence point must be greater than 7.

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
From Figure 14.6 (page 454) and Example 14.8, it should be clear that the indicator 
used in this titration must change color at about pH 9. Phenolphthalein (end point  
pH 5 9) is satisfactory. Methyl red (end point pH 5 5) is not suitable. If we used methyl 
red, we would stop the titration much too early, when reaction is only about 65% com-
plete. This situation is typical of weak acid-strong base titrations. For such a titration, we 
choose an indicator that changes color above pH 7.

Figure 14.8 shows how pH changes when fifty milliliters of one molar NH3 is titrated 
with one molar HCl. In many ways, this curve is the inverse of that shown in Figure 14.6 
for the weak acid–strong base case. In particular,
•	 the original pH is that of 1.000 M NH3, a weak base (Kb 5 1.8 3 1025). As you would 
expect, it lies between 7 and 14:
[OH2]2 < Kb 3 [NH3]o 5 (1.8 3 1025)(1.000)

From Figure 14.8, it should be clear that the only suitable indicator listed is methyl 
red. The other two indicators would change color too early, before the equivalence point. 
In general, for the titration of a weak base with a strong acid, the indicator should change 
color on the acid side of pH 7.

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
Titration of Diprotic Acids
Recall from Chapter 13 that a diprotic acid is one with two ionizable hydrogen ions. The 
hydrogen ions come off the diprotic acid one at a time and each ionization has its own 
equilibrium constant.
H2X(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 HX2(aq)	
Ka1
HX2(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 X22(aq)	
Ka2
Because of this stepwise ionization, titration curves of diprotic acids have two 
equivalence points as shown in Figure 14.9. The first equivalence point in the titration 
curve represents the titration of the first H1, and the second equivalence point repre-
sents the titration of the second proton.
Notice from Figure 14.9 that the volume of NaOH required to reach the second 
equivalence point is the same as that required to reach the first equivalence point. That 
is because the number of moles of H2X yields HX2 in a 1:1 ratio. Thus the titration to the 
second equivalence point requires the same number of moles to neutralize H2X to HX2 
as to neutralize HX2 to X22. This makes sense since the overall neutralization reaction 
for one mole of H2X requires two moles of OH2.

14.3  acid-base titrations
Summary
Table 14.3 summarizes our discussion of acid-base titrations. Notice that for these three 
types of titrations,
•	 the equations (second column) that describe the reactions are quite different. Strong 
acids and bases are represented by H1 and OH2 ions, respectively; weak acids and 
weak bases are represented by their chemical formulas.
•	 the equilibrium constants (K) for all these reactions are very large, indicating that 
the reactions go essentially to completion.
•	 the pH at the equivalence point is determined by which species are present. When 
only “spectator ions” are present, as in a strong acid–strong base titration, the pH at 
the equivalence point is 7. Basic anions (F2, C2H3O22), formed during a weak acid–
strong base titration, make the pH at the equivalence point greater than 7. Conversely, 
acidic species (NH41, HClO) formed during a strong acid–weak base titration make 
the pH at the equivalence point less than 7.
H1 and OH2 ions are the reacting spe-
cies in strong acids and strong bases, 
respectively.
Why do you suppose we ignore weak 
acid–weak base titrations?

chapter fourteen  Equilibria in Acid-Base Solutions
Acid Rain
Natural rainfall has a pH of about 5.5. It is slightly acidic because of 
dissolved carbon dioxide, which reacts with water to form the 
weak acid H2CO3. In contrast, the average pH of rainfall in the 
eastern United States and southeastern Canada is about 4.4, cor-
responding to an H1 ion concentration more than ten times the 
normal value. In an extreme case, rain with a pH of 1.5 was recorded 
in Wheeling, West Virginia (distilled vinegar has a pH of 2.4).
Acid rain results from the presence of two strong acids in pol-
luted air: H2SO4 and HNO3. Nitric acid comes largely from a three-
step process. The fi rst step involves the formation of NO from the 
elements by high-temperature combustion, as in an automobile 
engine. This is then oxidized to NO2, which in turn undergoes the 
following reaction:
2NO2(g) 1 H2O 9: HNO3(aq) 1 HNO2(aq)
The principal source of sulfur dioxide, the precursor of sulfuric 
acid, is high-sulfur coal. Coal used in power plants can contain up 
to 4% sulfur, mostly in the form of minerals such as pyrite, FeS2. 
Combustion forms sulfur dioxide:
4FeS2(s) 1 11 O2(g) 9: 2Fe2O3(s) 1 8SO2(g)
Sulfur dioxide formed by reactions such as this is converted to 
H2SO4 in the air by a two-step process:
 
(1) SO2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g) 9: SO3(g)
(2) SO3(g) 1 H2O 9: H2SO4(aq)
The sulfuric acid forms as tiny droplets high in the atmosphere. 
These may be carried by prevailing winds as far as 1500 km. The 
acid rain that falls in the Adirondacks of New york (where up to 
40% of the lakes are acidic) comes from sulfur dioxide produced 
by power plants in Ohio and Illinois.
CHEMISTRy beYond the claSSrooM
The eff ects of acid rain are particularly severe in areas where 
the bedrock is granite or other materials incapable of neutralizing 
H1 ions. As the concentration of acid builds up in a lake, aquatic life, 
from algae to brook trout, dies. The end product is a crystal-clear, 
totally sterile lake.
Acid rain adversely aff ects trees as well (Figure A). It appears 
that the damage is largely due to the leaching of metal cations 
from the soil. In particular, H1 ions in acid rain can react with in-
soluble aluminum compounds in the soil, bringing Al31 ions into 
solution. The following reaction is typical:
Al(OH)3(s) 1 3H1(aq) 9: Al31(aq) 1 3H2O
Al31 ions in solution can have a direct toxic eff ect on the roots of 
trees. perhaps more important, Al31 can replace Ca21, an ion that is 
essential to the growth of all plants.
Strong acids in the atmosphere can also attack building materi-
als such as limestone or marble (calcium carbonate):
CaCO3(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Ca21(aq) 1 CO2(g) 1 H2O
The relatively soluble calcium compounds formed this way [CaSO4, 
Ca(NO3)2] are gradually washed away (Figure B). This process is 
responsible for the deterioration of the Greek ruins on the Acropo-
lis in Athens. These structures suff ered more damage in the twen-
tieth century than in the preceding 2000 years.
Sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants can be reduced by 
spraying a water solution of calcium hydroxide directly into the 
smokestack. This “scrubbing” operation brings about the reaction
Ca21(aq) 1 2 OH2(aq) 1 SO2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g) 9: CaSO4(s) 1 H2O
The good news is that processes such as this have reduced SO2 
emissions by 40% over the past 30 years. The bad news is that NO 
emissions have slowly but steadily increased.

hus far, we have looked at the equilibrium established when acids, bases or both of 
these are added to water.
In this chapter we will discuss the equilibrium of complex ion formation (Sec-
tion 15.1). Solubility (Section 15.2) and precipitation (Section 15.3), discussed in Chapter 4, 
are reexamined with a focus on an equilibrium constant Ksp. We will also learn how to dis-
solve precipitates (Section 15.4) by making them react with strong acids or complexing 
agents forming complex ions.
The equilibria involving complex ions and precipitates have applications in geology, 
medicine, and agriculture. In chemistry, you are more likely to meet up with these equilibria 
in the laboratory when you carry out experiments in qualitative analysis.
15.1 Complex Ion Equilibria; Formation Constant (Kf)
Recall from Chapter 13 the Lewis model for the definition of an acid and a base. Many of 
the electron acceptors for Lewis acids are transition metal ions (Lewis acids). These  
metal ions combine with molecules (e.g., H2O, NH3) or other ions (e.g., Cl2, OH2) that 
Surrounded by beakers, by strange coils, 
By ovens and flasks with twisted necks, 
The chemist, fathoming the whims of 
attractions, 
Artfully imposes on them their precise 
meetings.

are good electron-pair donors (Lewis bases). The product of this combination is a  
complex ion. Chapter 19 will discuss the chemistry of these ions in greater detail.
The equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion is called a formation 
constant (or stability constant) and given the symbol Kf. A typical example is
Cu21(aq) 1 4NH3(aq) EF Cu(NH3)421(aq)        Kf 5 
3Cu1NH32 4
 214
3Cu2143NH344
Table 15.1 lists formation constants of complex ions. In each case, Kf applies to the 
formation of the complex by a reaction of the type just cited. Notice that for most com-
plex ions in Table 15.1, Kf is a large number: 105 or greater. This means that equilibrium 
considerations strongly favor complex formation. Consider, for example, the system
Ag1(aq) 1 2NH3(aq) EF Ag(NH3)21(aq)
Kf 5 
3Ag1NH32 2
 14
3Ag143NH342 5 1.7 3 107
The large Kf value means that the forward reaction goes virtually to completion. Addi-
tion of ammonia to a solution of AgNO3 will convert nearly all the Ag1 ions to Ag(NH3)21 
(see Example 15.1).

From Example 15.1 we see that the reaction for the conversion of Ag(NH3)21 to 
Ag(S2O3)232 has a large equilibrium constant. Looking at it in a slightly different way, 
we can say that of these two complexes of Ag1, the Ag(S2O3)232 ion is the more 
stable.

15.2  solubility; solubility product constant (Ksp)
15.2 Solubility; Solubility Product Constant (Ksp)
In Chapter 4, we considered a compound soluble if it dissolved in water and insoluble if 
it did not. In this section, we look at the dissolution process in the context of an equilib-
rium existing between the component ions of an ionic solid and the solid itself.
Consider SrCrO4 in water (Figure 15.1). Much like the weak acid HF in water,
HF(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 F2(aq)
an equilibrium is established in solution between the compound (SrCrO4) and its corre-
sponding ions (Sr21 and CrO422). The net ionic equation representing this equilibrium is
SrCrO4(s) EF Sr21(aq) + CrO422(aq)
Ksp Expression
The rules in Chapters 12 and 13 make it possible to write the equilibrium constant ex-
pression for the dissolving of SrCrO4. In particular, the solid does not appear in the 
expression; the concentration of each ion is raised to a power equal to its coefficient in 
the chemical equation.
Ksp 5 [Sr21][CrO422]
The symbol Ksp represents a particular type of equilibrium constant known as the solu-
bility product constant. Like all equilibrium constants, Ksp has a fixed value for a given 
system at a particular temperature. At 258C, Ksp for SrCrO4 is about 3.6 3 1025; that is,
[Sr21][CrO422] 5 3.6 3 1025
This relation says that the product of the two ion concentrations at equilibrium must be 
3.6 3 1025, regardless of how equilibrium is established.

Ksp and Water Solubility
One way to establish equilibrium between a slightly soluble solid and its ions in solution 
is to stir the solid with water to form a saturated solution. As you might expect, the solu-
bility of the solid, s, in moles per liter, is related to the solubility product constant, Ksp. In

This means that a saturated solution can be prepared by dissolving 2.3 mg of BaSO4 
in enough water to make 1.0 L of solution. Putting it another way, dissolving less than 
2.3 mg results in an unsaturated solution. If more than 2.3 mg are added, an equilibrium 
is established between the solution containing 1.0 3 1025 M Ba21 and SO422 and the solid 
BaSO4.
When an ionic solid consists of anions and cations of different charges, the relation 
between Ksp and s takes a different form, but the principle is the same (Example 15.4).
s is always the molar solubility.

15.2  solubility; solubility product constant (Ksp)
Frequently we find that the experimentally determined solubility of an ionic solid is 
larger than that predicted from Ksp. Consider, for example, PbCl2, where the solubility 
calculated from the relation
4s3 5 Ksp 5 1.7 3 1025
is 0.016 mol/L. The measured solubility is considerably larger, 0.036 mol/L. The explana-
tion for this is that some of the lead in PbCl2 goes into solution in the form of species 
other than Pb21. In particular, we can detect the presence of the ions Pb(OH)1 and 
PbCl1.
The reverse of Example 15.4 involves finding Ksp of a compound given its solubility. 
The solubilities of many ionic compounds are determined experimentally and tabulated 
in chemical handbooks. Most solubility values are given in grams of solute dissolved in 
100 grams of water. To obtain the molar solubility in moles/L, we have to assume that  
the density of the solution is equal to that of water. Then the number of grams of solute 
per 100 g water is equal to the number of grams of solute per 100 mL of solution.

Ksp and the Common Ion Effect
How would you expect the solubility of barium sulfate in water
BaSO4(s) EF Ba21(aq) 1 SO422(aq)
to compare with that in a 0.10 M solution of Na2SO4, which contains the same (common) 
anion, SO422? A moment’s reflection should convince you that the solubility in 0.10 M 
Na2SO4 must be less than that in pure water. Recall that when BaSO4 is dissolved in pure 
water, [SO422] is 1.0 3 1025 M. Increasing the concentration of SO422 to 0.10 M should, 
by Le Châtelier’s principle, drive the above equilibrium to the left, repressing the solubil-
ity of barium sulfate. This is, indeed, the case (Example 15.6).
A “common” ion comes from two 
sources such as BaSO4 and Na2SO4.
Common ion effect. The tube at the 
left contains a saturated solution of 
silver acetate (AgC2H3O2). Originally 
the tube at the right also contained 
a saturated solution of silver acetate. 
With the addition of a solution of silver 
nitrate (AgNO3), the solubility equilib-
rium of the silver acetate is shifted by 
the common ion Ag1 and additional 
silver acetate precipitates.

15.3  precipitate formation
15.3 Precipitate Formation
As we saw in Chapter 4, a precipitate forms when a cation from one solution combines 
with an anion from another solution to form an insoluble ionic solid. We also considered 
how to predict whether such a reaction would occur and, if so, how to represent it by a 
net ionic equation.
Precipitation reactions, like all reactions, reach a position of equilibrium. Putting it 
another way, even the most “insoluble” electrolyte dissolves to at least a slight extent, thereby 
establishing equilibrium with its ions in solution. Suppose, for example, solutions of 
Sr(NO3)2 and K2CrO4 are mixed. In this case, Sr21 ions combine with CrO422 ions to form 
a yellow precipitate of strontium chromate, SrCrO4 (Figure 15.3). Very quickly, an equilib-
rium is established between the solid and the corresponding ions in solution:
SrCrO4(s) EF Sr21(aq) 1 CrO422(aq)
Ksp and Precipitate Formation
Ksp values can be used to make predictions as to whether or not a precipitate will form 
when two solutions are mixed. To do this, we follow an approach very similar to that 
used in Chapter 12, to determine the direction in which a system will move to reach 
equilibrium. We work with a quantity Q, which has the same mathematical form as Ksp. 
The difference is that the concentrations that appear in Q are those that apply at a par-
ticular moment. Those that appear in Ksp are equilibrium concentrations. That is, the 
value of Q is expected to change as a precipitation reaction proceeds, approaching Ksp 
and eventually becoming equal to it.
Three cases can be distinguished (Figure 15.4):
	 1.	 If Q . Ksp, the solution contains a higher concentration of ions than it can hold at 
equilibrium. A precipitate forms, decreasing the concentrations until the ion prod-
uct becomes equal to Ksp and equilibrium is established.
	 2.	 If Q , Ksp, the solution contains a lower concentration of ions than is required for 
equilibrium with the solid. The solution is unsaturated. No precipitate forms; equi-
librium is not established.
	 3.	 If Q 5 Ksp, the solution is just saturated with ions and is at the point of precipitation.

Selective Precipitation
One way to separate two cations in water solution is to add an anion that precipitates only 
one of the cations. This approach is known as selective precipitation. To see how it works, 
consider a simple case, a solution containing Mg21 and Na1 ions. Referring to Table 15.2, 
you can see that Mg21 forms a couple of insoluble compounds: MgCO3 (Ksp 5 6.8 3 1026) 
and Mg(OH)2 (Ksp 5 6 3 10212). In contrast, all of the common compounds of sodium 
are soluble, including the carbonate and hydroxide. It follows that you could readily sepa-
rate Mg21 from Na1 by adding either CO322 or OH2 ions to the solution. In either case, 
Mg21 will precipitate while Na1 remains in solution.
Now let us consider a somewhat more complex case. Suppose you have a solution 
containing Mg21 and Ba21, both at 0.10 M, which you’d like to separate by adding CO322 
ions. From Table 15.2, it appears that BaCO3 (Ksp 5 2.6 3 1029) is less soluble than 
MgCO3 (Ksp 5 6.8 3 1026). Perhaps, by adding CO322 ions carefully, you could precipi-
tate Ba21 selectively, leaving Mg21 in solution.
This is indeed the case. To precipitate BaCO3, add enough CO322 ions to make their 
concentration 2.6 3 1028 M:
[CO322] 5 
Ksp BaCO3
3Ba214
5 2.6 3 1029

 5 2.6 3 1028 M
At this very low concentration of CO322, MgCO3 does not precipitate:

15.4 Dissolving Precipitates
Many different methods can be used to bring water-insoluble ionic solids  into solution. 
Most commonly, this is done by adding a reagent to react with either the anion or the 
cation. The two most useful reagents for this purpose are
•	 a strong acid, H1, used to react with basic anions.
•	 a complexing agent, most often NH3 or OH2, added to react with metal cations.
strategy

Strong Acid
Water-insoluble metal hydroxides can be brought into solution with a strong acid such 
as HCl. The reaction with zinc hydroxide is typical:
Zn(OH)2(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 2H2O
We can imagine that this reaction occurs in two (reversible) steps:
	 dissolving Zn(OH)2 in water:	
Zn(OH)2(s) EF Zn21(aq) 1 2 OH2(aq)
	 neutralizing OH2 ions by H1:	
2H1(aq) 1 2 OH2(aq) EF 2H2O
	
Zn(OH)2(s) 1 2H1(aq) EF Zn21(aq) 1 2H2O
The equilibrium constant for the neutralization (Example 15.9) is so large that the overall 
reaction goes essentially to completion.

15.4  dissolving precipitates
Strong acid can also be used to dissolve many water-insoluble salts in which the 
anion is a weak base. In particular, H1 ions will dissolve
•	 virtually all carbonates (CO322). The product is the weak acid H2CO3, which then 
decomposes into CO2 and H2O. The equation for the reaction of H1 ions with ZnCO3 
is typical:
ZnCO3(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2CO3(aq)
•	 many sulfides (S22). The driving force behind this reaction is the formation of the 
weak acid H2S, much of which evolves as a gas. The reaction in the case of zinc 
sulfide is
ZnS(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2S(aq)

Ammonia and sodium hydroxide are commonly used to dissolve precipitates containing 
a cation that forms a stable complex with NH3 or OH2 (Table 15.3). The reactions with 
zinc hydroxide are typical:

Zn(OH)2(s) 1 2 OH2(aq) 9: Zn(OH)422(aq)

for example, the reaction by which zinc hydroxide dissolves in ammonia. Again, imagine 
that the reaction occurs in two steps:

Qualitative Analysis
In the laboratory you will most likely carry out one or more experi-
ments involving the separation and identifi cation of cations 
present in an “unknown” solution. A scheme of analysis for 21 dif-
ferent cations is shown in Table A. As you can see, the general ap-
proach is to take out each group (I, II, III, IV) in succession, using 
selective precipitation.
Group i consists of the only three common cations that form 
insoluble chlorides: Ag1, Pb21, and hg221. Addition of hydrochloric 
acid precipitates AgCl, PbCl2, and hg2Cl2. Cations in groups II, III, 
and IV remain in solution, since their chlorides are soluble.
Group ii consists of six diﬀ erent cations, all of which form very 
insoluble sulfi des (Figure A). These compounds are precipitated 
selectively by adding hydrogen sulfi de, a toxic, foul-smelling gas, at 
a ph of 0.5. At this rather high h1 ion concentration, 0.3 M, the 
equilibrium
h2S(aq) EF 2h1(aq) 1 S22(aq)
lies far to the left. The concentration of S22 is extremely low, but 
suﬃ  cient to precipitate all the cations in this group, including Cu21.
Cu21(aq) 1 h2S(aq) 9: CuS(s) 1 2h1(aq)    K 5 1 3 1016
Group iii sulfi des are much more diﬃ  cult to precipitate than 
those of group II. Compare, for example, the equilibrium constant

with that given above for the precipitation of CuS. however, when 
the solution is made basic (ph 5 9), the situation changes. The 
concentration of h1 ion drops sharply and, as you would expect 
from le Châtelier’s principle, the reaction just cited becomes 
much more spontaneous. Five of the group III cations precipitate 
as sulfi des. The other two come down as hydroxides, e.g.,

chapter fifteen  Complex Ion and Precipitation Equilibria
The colors of these precipitates are shown in Figure B (page 489).
Group IV cations have soluble chlorides and sulfides, so they 
are still in solution at this point. The alkaline earth cations (Mg21, 
Ca21, Ba21) are precipitated as carbonates
M21(aq) 1 CO322(aq) 9: MCO3(s)    M 5 Mg, Ca, Ba
The alkali metal cations are identified by flame tests (Figure C).
Once the groups are separated from one another, the individual 
cations in each group must, of course, be separated and identified. 
This is where things get complicated. A process that might be re-
ferred to as “selective dissolving” is often involved. Consider, for 
example, the precipitate obtained in Group I: PbCl2, AgCl, and 
Hg2Cl2. Of the three solids, lead chloride is by far the most soluble 
in water. Stirring it with hot water brings it into solution
PbCl2(s) 9: Pb21(aq) 1 2Cl2(aq)
leaving the other two compounds behind. Further treatment with 
ammonia dissolves silver chloride
AgCl(s) 1 2NH3(aq) 9: Ag(NH3)21(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)
but not Hg2Cl2. 
Figure C Flame tests for Na1 (yellow) and K1 (violet). A drop of

he goal of this chapter is to answer a basic question: Will a given reaction occur “by 
itself” at a particular temperature and pressure, without the exertion of any outside 
force? In that sense, is the reaction spontaneous? This is a critical question in just about 
every area of science and technology. A synthetic organic chemist looking for a source of 
acetylene, C2H2, would like to know whether this compound can be made by heating the ele-
ments together. A metallurgist trying to produce titanium metal from TiO2 would like to know 
what reaction to use; would hydrogen, carbon, or aluminum be feasible reducing agents?
To develop a general criterion for spontaneity, we will apply the principles of thermody-
namics, the science that deals with heat and energy effects. Three different thermodynamic 
functions are of value in analyzing spontaneity.
1.	 DH, the change in enthalpy (Chapter 8); a negative value of DH tends to make a reaction 
spontaneous.
2.	 DS, the change in entropy (Section 16.2); a positive value of DS tends to make a reaction 
spontaneous.
3.	 DG, the change in free energy (Sections 16.3, 16.4); a reaction at constant temperature 
and pressure will be spontaneous if DG is negative, no ifs, ands, or buts.

16.1  spontaneous processes
Besides serving as a general criterion for spontaneity, the free energy change can be  
used to:
• determine the effect of temperature, pressure, and concentration on reaction sponta-
neity (Section 16.5).
• calculate the equilibrium constant for a reaction (Section 16.6).
• determine whether coupled reactions will be spontaneous (Section 16.7).
16.1 Spontaneous Processes
All of us are familiar with certain spontaneous processes. For example,
•	 an ice cube melts when added to a glass of water at room temperature
H2O(s) 9: H2O(l)
•	 a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen burns if ignited by a spark
2H2(g) 1 O2(g) 9: 2H2O(l)
•	 an iron (steel) tool exposed to moist air rusts
2Fe(s) 1 3
2 O2(g) 1 3H2O(l) 9: 2Fe(OH)3(s)
In other words, these three reactions are spontaneous at 258C and 1 atm.
The word “spontaneous” does not imply anything about how rapidly a reaction oc-
curs. Some spontaneous reactions, notably the rusting of iron, are quite slow. Often a 
reaction that is spontaneous does not occur without some sort of stimulus to get the re-
action started. A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen shows no sign of reaction in the ab-
sence of a spark or match. Once started, though, a spontaneous reaction continues by 
itself without further input of energy from the outside.
If a reaction is spontaneous under a given set of conditions, the reverse reaction 
must be nonspontaneous. For example, water does not spontaneously decompose to the 
elements by the reverse of the reaction referred to above.
2H2O(l) 9: 2H2(g) 1 O2(g)        nonspontaneous
However, it is often possible to bring about a nonspontaneous reaction by supplying energy 
in the form of work. Electrolysis can be used to decompose water to the elements. Electrical 
energy must be furnished for the decomposition, perhaps from a storage battery.
Perhaps the simplest way to define spontaneity is to say that a spontaneous process 
is one that moves the reaction system toward equilibrium. A nonspontaneous process 
moves the system away from equilibrium.
The Energy Factor
Many spontaneous processes proceed with a decrease of energy. Boulders roll downhill, not 
uphill. A storage battery discharges when you leave your car’s headlights on. Extrapolat-
ing to chemical reactions, one might guess that spontaneous reactions would be exother-
mic (DH , 0). Marcellin Berthelot (1827–1907) in Paris and Julius Thomsen (1826–1909) 
in Copenhagen proposed this as a general principle, applicable to all reactions.
Instead it turns out that in almost all cases the reverse is true. Nearly all exothermic 
chemical reactions are spontaneous at 258C and 1 atm. Consider, for example, the forma-
tion of water from the elements and the rusting of iron:
 
2H2(g) 1 O2(g) 9: 2H2O(l)	
DH 5 2571.6 kJ
 
2Fe(s) 1 3
2 O2(g) 1 3H2O(l) 9: 2Fe(OH)3(s)	
DH 5 2788.6 kJ
For both of these spontaneous reactions, DH is a negative quantity.
On the other hand, this simple rule fails for many familiar phase changes. An ex-
ample of a spontaneous reaction that is not exothermic is the melting of ice. This takes 
place spontaneously at 1 atm above 08C, even though it is endothermic:
 
H2O(s) 9: H2O(l)	
DH 5 16.0 kJ
A spark is OK, but a continuous input 
of energy isn’t.

chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
There is still another basic objection to using the sign of DH as a general criterion 
for spontaneity. Endothermic reactions that are nonspontaneous at room temperature 
often become spontaneous when the temperature is raised. Consider, for example, the 
decomposition of limestone:
 
CaCO3(s) 9: CaO(s) 1 CO2(g)	
DH 5 1178.3 kJ
At 258C and 1 atm, this reaction does not occur. Witness the existence of the white cliffs of 
Dover and other limestone deposits over eons of time. However, if the temperature is 
raised to about 1100 K, limestone decomposes to give off carbon dioxide gas at 1 atm. In 
other words, this endothermic reaction becomes spontaneous at high temperatures. This is 
true despite the fact that DH remains about 178 kJ, nearly independent of temperature.
The Randomness Factor
Clearly, the direction of a spontaneous change is not always determined by the tendency 
for a system to go to a state of lower energy. There is another natural tendency that must 
be taken into account to predict the direction of spontaneity. Nature tends to move spon-
taneously from a state of lower probability to one of higher probability. Or, as G. N. 
Lewis put it,
Each system which is left to its own, will over time, change toward a condition of maximum 
probability.
To illustrate what these statements mean, consider a pastime far removed from 
chemistry: tossing dice. If you’ve ever shot craps (and maybe even if you haven’t), you 
know that when a pair of dice is thrown, a 7 is much more likely to come up than a 12. 
Figure 16.1 shows why this is the case. There are six different ways to throw a 7 and only 
one way to throw a 12. Over time, dice will come up 7 six times as often as 12. A 7 is a state 
of “high” probability; a 12 is a state of “low” probability.
Now let’s consider a process a bit closer to chemistry (Figure 16.2). Two different gases, 
let us say H2 and N2, are originally contained in different glass bulbs, separated by a stop-
cock. When the stopcock is opened, the two different kinds of molecules distribute them-
selves evenly between the two bulbs. Eventually, half of the H2 molecules will end up in the 
left bulb and half in the right; the same holds for the N2 molecules. Each gas achieves its 
own most probable distribution, independent of the presence of the other gas.
We could explain the results of this experiment the way we did before; the final distri-
bution is clearly much more probable than the initial distribution. There is, however, an-
other useful way of looking at this process. The system has gone from a highly ordered state 
(all the H2 molecules on the left, all the N2 molecules on the right) to a more disordered, or 
random, state in which the molecules are distributed evenly between the two bulbs. The 
same situation holds when marbles rather than molecules are mixed (Figure 16.3). In gen-
eral, nature tends to move spontaneously from more ordered to more random states.
Figure 16.1 Certain “states” are 
more probable than others. For ex-
ample, when you toss a pair of dice,  
a 7 is much more likely to come up  
than a 12.

16.2  entropy, s
This statement is quite easy for parents or students to understand. Your room tends 
to get messy because an ordered room has few options for objects to be moved around 
(leaving socks on the floor is not an option for an orderly room). The comedian Bill 
Cosby insists that with an army of 80 two-year-olds he could take over any country in 
the world, because they have a remarkable ability for disorganization.
16.2 Entropy, S
Entropy is often described as a measure of disorder or randomness. While useful, 
these terms are subjective and should be used cautiously. It is better to think about 
entropic changes in terms of the change in the number of microstates of the system. 
Microstates are different ways in which molecules can be distributed. An increase in 
the number of possible microstates (i.e., disorder) results in an increase of entropy. 
Entropy treats the randomness factor quantitatively. Rudolf Clausius gave it the sym-
bol S for no particular reason. In general, the more random the state, the larger the 
number of its possible microstates, the more probable the state, thus the greater its 
entropy.
Entropy, like enthalpy (Chapter 8), is a state property. That is, the entropy depends 
only on the state of a system, not on its history. The entropy change is determined by the 
entropies of the final and initial states, not on the path followed from one state to 
another.
DS 5 Sfinal 2 Sinitial
Several factors influence the amount of entropy that a system has in a particular 
state. In general,
•	 a liquid has a higher entropy than the solid from which it is formed. In a solid the 
atoms or molecules are confined to fixed positions, so the number of microstates is 
small. In the liquid, these atoms or molecules can occupy many more positions as 
they move away from the lattice. Thus, the number of microstates increases and there 
are then many more ways to arrange the particles. The phase transition is from an 
“ordered” to a “disordered” system.
•	 a gas has a higher entropy than the liquid from which it is formed. When vaporiza-
tion occurs, the particles acquire greater freedom to move about. They are distributed 
throughout the entire container instead of being restricted to a small volume. In va-
porization, the number of microstates increases.
•	 increasing the temperature of a substance increases its entropy. Raising the tempera-
ture increases the kinetic energy of the molecules (or atoms or ions) and hence their 
freedom of motion. In the solid, the molecules vibrate with a greater amplitude at 
higher temperatures. In a liquid or a gas, they move about more rapidly.
These effects are shown in Figure 16.4, where the entropy of ammonia, NH3, is plot-
ted versus temperature. Note that the entropy of solid ammonia at 0 K is zero. This re-
flects the fact that molecules are completely ordered in the solid state at this temperature;

stance increases its entropy.

chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
there is no randomness whatsoever. More generally, the third law of thermodynamics 
tells us that a completely ordered pure crystalline solid has an entropy of zero at 0 K.
Notice from the figure that the effect of temperature on entropy is due almost en-
tirely to phase changes. The slope of the curve is small in regions where only one phase 
is present. In contrast, there is a large jump in entropy when the solid melts and an even 
larger one when the liquid vaporizes. This behavior is typical of all substances; melting 
and vaporization are accompanied by relatively large increases in entropy.
What is the sign of DS for 
egg 9: omelet?
We’ll get to the second law shortly.
Standard Molar Entropies
The entropy of a substance, unlike its enthalpy, can be evaluated directly. The details of 
how this is done are beyond the level of this text, but Figure 16.4 (page 499) shows the 
results for one substance, ammonia. From such a plot you can read off the standard mo-
lar entropy at 1 atm pressure and any given temperature, most often 258C. This quantity 
is given the symbol S8 and has the units of joules per mole per kelvin (J/mol · K). From 
Figure 16.4, it appears that
S8 NH3(g) at 258C < 192 J/mol · K
Standard molar entropies of elements, compounds, and aqueous ions are listed in 
Table 16.1. Notice that
•	 elements have nonzero standard entropies. This means that in calculating the stan-
dard entropy change for a reaction, DS8, elements as well as compounds must be 
taken into account.
•	 standard molar entropies of pure substances (elements and compounds) are always 
positive quantities (S8 . 0).
•	 aqueous ions may have negative S8 values. This is a consequence of the arbitrary way 
in which ionic entropies are defined, taking
S8 H1(aq) 5 0
The fluoride ion has a standard entropy 13.8 units less than that of H1; hence S8 F2(aq) 5 
213.8 J/mol · K.

As a group, gases have higher entropies than liquids or solids. Moreover, among 
substances of similar structure and physical state, entropy usually increases with molar 
mass. Compare, for example, the hydrocarbons
  CH4(g)        S8 5 186.2 J/mol · K
C2H6(g)        S8 5 229.5 J/mol · K
C3H8(g)        S8 5 269.9 J/mol · K
As the molecule becomes more complex, there are more ways for the atoms to move 
about with respect to one another, leading to a higher entropy.

DS  8 for Reactions
Table 16.1 can be used to calculate the standard entropy change, DS8, for reactions, from 
the relation
	
DS8 5  a S8products 2  a S8reactants 
(16.1)
In taking these sums, the standard molar entropies are multiplied by the number of 
moles specified in the balanced chemical equation.
To show how this relation is used, consider the reaction

Observe that DS8 for the decomposition of calcium carbonate is a positive quantity. 
This is reasonable because the gas formed, CO2, has a much higher molar entropy than 
either of the solids, CaO or CaCO3. As a matter of fact, a reaction that results in an in-
crease in the number of moles of gas is almost always accompanied by an increase in 
entropy. Conversely, if the number of moles of gas decreases, DS8 is a negative quantity.
Consider, for example, the reaction
2H2(g) 1 O2(g) 9: 2H2O(l)

If there is no change to the number of 
moles of gas, DS is usually small.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The relationship between entropy change and spontaneity can be expressed through a 
basic principle of nature known as the second law of thermodynamics. One way to state 
this law is to say that in a spontaneous process, there is a net increase in entropy, taking 
into account both system and surroundings. That is,
DSuniverse 5 (DSsystem 1 DSsurroundings) . 0        spontaneous process
(Recall from Chapter 8 that the system is that portion of the universe on which attention 
is focused; the surroundings include everything else.)
Notice that the second law refers to the total entropy change, involving both system 
and surroundings. For many spontaneous processes, the entropy change for the system 
is a negative quantity. Consider, for example, the rusting of iron, a spontaneous process:
2Fe(s) 1 3
2 O2(g) 1 3H2O(l) 9: 2Fe(OH)3(s)
DS8 for this system at 258C and 1 atm can be calculated from a table of standard entro-
pies; it is found to be 2358.4 J/K. The negative sign of DS8 is entirely consistent with the 
second law. All the law requires is that the entropy change of the surroundings be greater 
than 358.4 J/K, so that DSuniverse . 0.
In principle, the second law can be used to determine whether a reaction is sponta-
neous. To do that, however, requires calculating the entropy change for the surround-
ings, which is not easy. We follow a conceptually simpler approach (Section 16.3), which 
deals only with the thermodynamic properties of chemical systems.
16.3 Free Energy, G
As pointed out earlier, two thermodynamic quantities affect reaction spontaneity. One of 
these is the enthalpy, H; the other is the entropy, S. The problem is to put these two quanti-
ties together in such a way as to arrive at a single function whose sign will determine 
whether a reaction is spontaneous. This problem was first solved more than a century ago 
by J. Willard Gibbs, who introduced a new quantity, now called the Gibbs free energy and 
given the symbol G. Gibbs showed that for a reaction taking place at constant pressure and 
temperature, DG represents that portion of the total energy change that is available (i.e., 
“free”) to do useful work. If, for example, DG for a reaction is 2270 kJ, it is possible to ob-
tain 270 kJ of useful work from the reaction. Conversely, if DG is 1270 kJ, at least that 
much energy in the form of work must be supplied to make the reaction take place.
The basic definition of the Gibbs free energy is
G 5 H 2 TS
where T is the absolute (Kelvin) temperature. The free energy of a substance, like its 
enthalpy and entropy, is a state property; its value is determined only by the state of a 
In this sense, the universe is running

chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
system, not by how it got there. Putting it another way, DG for a reaction depends 
only on the nature of products and reactants and the conditions (temperature, pres-
sure, and concentration). It does not depend on the path by which the reaction is 
carried out.
The sign of the free energy change can be used to determine the spontaneity of a 
reaction carried out at constant temperature and pressure.
	 1.	 If DG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous.
	 2.	 If DG is positive, the reaction will not take place spontaneously. Instead, the re-
verse reaction will be spontaneous.
	 3.	 If DG is 0, the system is at equilibrium; there is no tendency for reaction to occur 
in either direction.
In other words, DG is a measure of the driving force of a reaction. Reactions, at 
constant pressure and temperature, go in such a direction as to decrease the free energy 
of the system. This means that the direction in which a reaction takes place is deter-
mined by the relative free energies of products and reactants. If the products at the speci-
fied conditions of temperature, pressure, and concentration have a lower free energy 
than the reactants (Gproducts , Greactants), the forward reaction will occur (Figure 16.5). If 
the reverse is true (Greactants , Gproducts), the reverse reaction is spontaneous. Finally, if 
Gproducts 5 Greactants, there is no driving force to make the reaction go in either direction.
Relation Among DG, DH, and DS
From the defining equation for free energy, it follows that at constant temperature
DG 5 DH 2 TDS
where DG, DH, and DS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy, respec-
tively, for a reaction. This relation, known as the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, is perhaps 
the most important equation in chemical thermodynamics. As you can see, two factors 
tend to make DG negative and hence lead to a spontaneous reaction:
	 1.	 A negative value of DH. Exothermic reactions (DH , 0) tend to be spontaneous, 
inasmuch as they contribute to a negative value of DG. On the molecular level, this 
means that there will be a tendency to form “strong” bonds at the expense of “weak” 
ones.
	 2.	 A positive value of DS. If the entropy change is positive (DS . 0), the term 2TDS 
will make a negative contribution to DG. Hence there will be a tendency for a reac-
tion to be spontaneous if the products are less ordered than the reactants.
In many physical changes, the entropy increase is the major driving force. This situa-
tion applies when two liquids with similar intermolecular forces, such as benzene (C6H6) 
and toluene (C7H8), are mixed. There is no change in enthalpy, but the entropy increases 
because the molecules of benzene and toluene are mixed randomly in solution.*

*The formation of a water solution is often accompanied by a decrease in entropy because hydrogen bonding

16.4  STAnDARD FREE EnERgy ChAngE, DG°

the driving force for spontaneity. An example is the synthesis of hydrogen fl uoride from 
the elements

2H2(g) 1 1
2F2(g) 9: HF(g)
For this reaction, DH is a large negative number, 2271.1 kJ, showing that the bonds in 
HF are stronger than those in the H2 and F2 molecules. As you might expect for a gas-
eous reaction in which there is no change in the number of moles, DS is very small, about 
0.0070 kJ/K. Th e free energy change, DG, at 1 atm is 2273.2 kJ at 258C, almost identical 
to DH. Even at very high temperatures, the diff erence between DG and DH is small, 
amounting to only about 14 kJ at 2000 K.
16.4 Standard Free Energy Change, DG8
Although the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is valid under all conditions we will apply it 
only under standard conditions, where
• gases are at one atmosphere partial pressure.
• ions or molecules in solution are at one molar concentration.
Two theoreticians working in the latter half 
of the nineteenth century changed the very 
nature of chemistry by deriving the math-
ematical laws that govern the behavior of 
matter undergoing physical or chemical 
change. One of these was James Clerk 
maxwell, whose contributions to kinetic 
theory were discussed in Chapter 5. The 
other was J. Willard gibbs, Professor of 
mathematical Physics at yale from 1871 
until his death in 1903.
In 1876 gibbs published the fi rst portion 
of a remarkable paper in the Transactions 
of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences 
titled, “On the Equilibrium of Heteroge-
neous Substances.” When the paper was 
completed in 1878 (it was 323 pages long), 
the foundation was laid for the science of 
chemical thermodynamics. For the fi rst 
time, the concept of free energy appeared. 
Included as well were the basic principles 
of chemical equilibrium (Chapter 12), 
phase equilibrium (Chapter 9), and the re-
lations governing energy changes in elec-
trical cells (Chapter 17).
If gibbs had never published another 
paper, this single contribution would have 
placed him among the greatest theoreti-
cians in the history of science. generations 
of experimental scientists have established 
their reputations by demonstrating in the 
laboratory the validity of the relationships 
that gibbs derived at his desk. many of 
these relationships were rediscovered by 
others; an example is the gibbs-Helmholtz 
equation developed in 1882 by Hermann 
von Helmholtz (1821–1894), a prestigious 
german physiologist and physicist who 
was completely unaware of gibbs’s work.
J. Willard gibbs is often cited as an 
example of the “prophet without honor in 
his own country.” His colleagues in New 
Haven and elsewhere in the united States 
seem not to have realized the signifi cance 
of his work until late in his life. During his 
fi rst ten years as a professor at yale he re-
ceived no salary. In 1920, when he was fi rst 
proposed for the Hall of Fame of Distin-
guished Americans at New york univer-
sity, he received 9 votes out of a possible 
100. Not until 1950 was he elected to that 
body. Even today the name of J. Willard 
gibbs is generally unknown among edu-
cated Americans outside of those inter-
ested in the natural sciences.
Admittedly, gibbs himself was largely 
responsible for the fact that for many years 
his work did not attract the attention it de-
served. He made little eff ort to publicize it; 
the Transactions of the Connecticut 
Academy of Sciences was hardly the 
leading scientifi c journal of its day. gibbs 
was one of those rare individuals who 
seem to have no inner need for recognition 
by contemporaries. His satisfaction came 
from solving a problem in his mind; having 
done so, he was ready to proceed to other 
problems. His papers are not easy to read; 
he seldom cites examples to illustrate his 
abstract reasoning. Frequently, the impli-
cations of the laws that he derives are left 
for the readers to grasp on their own. One 
of his colleagues at yale confessed many 
years later that none of the members of 
the Connecticut Academy of Sciences un-
derstood his paper on thermodynamics; as 
he put it, “We knew gibbs and took his 
contributions on faith.”

chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
In other words, we will use the equation in the form
	
DG8 5 DH8 2 TDS8	
(16.2)
where DG8 is the standard free energy change (1 atm, 1 M); DH8 is the standard en-
thalpy change, which can be calculated from heats of formation, DHf8 (listed in Table 8.3, 
Chapter 8); and DS8 is the standard entropy change (Table 16.1).
Recall that the sign of DG correlates with the spontaneity of reaction. We can do the 
same thing with DG8 provided we restrict our attention to standard conditions (1 atm, 
1 M).
1.  If DG8 is negative, the reaction is spontaneous at standard conditions. For example, 
the following reaction is spontaneous at 258C:
	
CaO(s) 1 CO2(g, 1 atm) 9: CaCO3(s)        DG8 at 258C 5 2130.4 kJ
2.  If DG8 is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous at standard conditions. The 
reaction
AgCl(s) 9: Ag1(aq, 1 M) 1 Cl2(aq, 1 M)        DG8 at 258C 5 155.7 kJ
is nonspontaneous at 258C. The reverse reaction is spontaneous; when solutions of 
AgNO3 and HCl are mixed in such a way that [Ag1] 5 [Cl2] 5 1 M, silver chloride 
precipitates.
3.  If DG8 is 0, the system is at equilibrium at standard conditions; there is no tendency 
for the reaction to occur in either direction. An example is the vaporization of water 
at 1008C and 1 atm:
H2O(l) 9: H2O(g, 1 atm)        DG8 5 0
under these conditions (i.e., at the normal boiling point), the molar free energies of 
liquid and gaseous water are identical. Hence DG8 5 0 and the system is at 
equilibrium.

Calculation of DG 8 at 258C; Free Energies of Formation
To illustrate the use of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (16.2), we apply it first to find DG8 
for a reaction at 258C (Example 16.3). To do this, the units of DH8 and DS8 must be consis-
tent. Using DH8 in kilojoules, it is necessary to convert DS8 from joules per kelvin to kilo-
joules per kelvin.

chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation can be used to calculate the standard free energy of 
formation of a compound. This quantity, DGf8, is analogous to the enthalpy of forma-
tion, DHf8. It is defined as the free energy change per mole when a compound is formed 
from the elements in their stable states at 1 atm.
Tables of standard free energies of formation at 258C of compounds and ions in so-
lution are given in Appendix 1 (along with standard heats of formation and standard 
entropies). Notice that, for most compounds, DGf8 is a negative quantity, which means 
that the compound can be formed spontaneously from the elements. This is true for 
water:
H2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g) 9: H2O(l)        DGf8 H2O(l) 5 2237.2 kJ/mol
and, at least in principle, for methane:
C(s) 1 2H2(g) 9: CH4(g)        DGf8 CH4(g) 5 250.7 kJ/mol
A few compounds, including acetylene, have positive free energies of formation (DGf8 
C2H2(g) 5 1209.2 kJ/mol). These compounds cannot be made from the elements at or-
dinary temperatures and pressures; indeed, they are potentially unstable with respect to 
the elements. In the case of acetylene, the reaction
C2H2(g) 9: 2C(s) 1 H2(g)        DG8 at 258C 5 2209.2 kJ
occurs with explosive violence unless special precautions are taken.
Values of DGf8 can be used to calculate free energy changes for reactions. The rela-
tionship is entirely analogous to that for enthalpies in Chapter 8:
	
DG8reaction 5  aDGf8products 2  aDGf8reactants 
(16.3)
If you calculate DG8 in this way, you should keep in mind an important limitation. 
DG8reaction is valid only at the temperature at which DGf8 data are tabulated, in this case 
258C. DG8 varies considerably with temperature, so this approach is not even approxi-
mately valid at other temperatures.
DGf8 for an element, like DHf8 , is zero.
To find DG 8 at temperatures other 
than 258C, use the Gibbs-Helmholtz 
equation.

16.4  standard free energy change, DG°
Calculation of DG 8 at Other Temperatures
To a good degree of approximation, the temperature variation of DH8 and DS8 can be 
neglected.* This means that to apply the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation
DG8 5 DH8 2 TDS8
at temperatures other than 258C, you need only change the value of T. The quantities 
DH8 and DS8 can be calculated in the usual way from tables of standard enthalpies and 
entropies.
*As far as the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is concerned, there is another reason for ignoring the temperature 
dependence of DH and DS. These two quantities always change in the same direction as the temperature 
changes (i.e., if DH becomes more positive, so does DS). Hence the two effects tend to cancel each other.
example 16.5
Iron, a large component of steel, is obtained by reducing iron(III) oxide (present in hematite ore) with hydrogen in a blast 
furnace. Steam is a byproduct of the reaction. Calculate DG8 at 2308C for the reduction of one mole of Fe2O3.

DH8 and DS8, is strongly dependent on temperature. This comes about, of course, be-
cause of the T in the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:
DG8 5 DH8 2 TDS8

it is clear that a plot of DG8 versus T should be linear, with a slope of 2DS8 and a y-intercept

chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
16.5 Effect of Temperature, Pressure, 
and Concentration on Reaction Spontaneity
A change in reaction conditions can, and often does, change the direction in which a 
reaction occurs spontaneously. The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation in the form
DG8 5 DH8 2 TDS8
is readily applied to deduce the effect of temperature on reaction spontaneity. To con-
sider the effect of pressure or concentration, we need an analogous expression for the 
dependence of DG on these factors.
Temperature
When the temperature of a reaction system is increased, the sign of DG8, and hence the 
direction in which the reaction proceeds spontaneously, may or may not change. Whether 
it does or does not depends on the signs of DH8 and DS8. The four possible situations, 
deduced from the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, are summarized in Table 16.2.
If DH8 and DS8 have opposite signs (Table 16.2, I and II), it is impossible to reverse 
the direction of spontaneity by a change in temperature alone. The two terms DH8 and 
2TDS8 reinforce one another. Hence DG8 has the same sign at all temperatures. Reac-
tions of this type are rather uncommon. One such reaction is
Cu(s) 1 H2O(g) 9: CuO(s) 1 H2(g)
Here DH8 is 184.5 kJ and DS8 is 20.0487 kJ/K. Hence
	
DG8 5 DH8 2 TDS8
	
5 184.5 kJ 1 T(0.0487 kJ/K)
Clearly DG8 is positive at all temperatures. The reaction cannot take place spontaneously 
at 1 atm regardless of temperature.
It is more common to find that DH8 and DS8 have the same sign (Table 16.2, III and 
IV). When this happens, the enthalpy and entropy factors oppose each other. DG8

16.5  effect of temperature, pressure, and concentration on reaction spontaneity
changes sign as temperature increases, and the direction of spontaneity reverses. At low 
temperatures, DH8 predominates, and the exothermic reaction, which may be either the 
forward or the reverse reaction, occurs. As the temperature rises, the quantity TDS8 in-
creases in magnitude and eventually exceeds DH8. At high temperatures, the reaction 
that leads to an increase in entropy occurs. In most cases, 258C is a “low” temperature, at 
least at a pressure of 1 atm. This explains why exothermic reactions are usually spontane-
ous at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
An example of a reaction for which DH8 and DS8 have the same sign is the decom-
position of calcium carbonate:
CaCO3(s) 9: CaO(s) 1 CO2(g)
Here DH8 5 1178.3 kJ and DS8 5 1160.5 J/K. Hence
DG8 5 1178.3 kJ 2 T(0.1605 kJ/K)
For this reaction at “low” temperatures, such as 298 K,
DG8 5 1178.3 kJ 2 47.8 kJ 5 1130.5 kJ
the DH8 term predominates, DG8 is positive, and the reaction is nonspontaneous at 
1 atm. Conversely, at “high” temperatures, such as 2000 K,
DG8 5 1178.3 kJ 2 321.0 kJ 5 2142.7 kJ
the TDS8 term predominates, DG8 is negative, and the reaction is spontaneous at 1 atm.
CaO is made commercially by heating 
CaCO3.

The development presented in Example 16.6 is an important one from a practical 
standpoint. It tells us the temperature at which the direction of spontaneity changes. In 
the reduction of Fe2O3 by hydrogen, this temperature is approximately 700 K. At lower 
temperatures, the reaction does not occur at standard conditions; recall from Example 
16.5 that DG8 at 500 K is 127.6 kJ. At temperatures above 700 K, DG8 has a negative sign 
and the reaction
Fe2O3(s) 1 3H2(g) 9: 2Fe(s) 1 3H2O(g)
is spontaneous.

512
 
chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
From a slightly different point of view, we can say that the equation T 5 DH8/DS8 
allows us to calculate the temperature at which a chemical or physical change is at equi-
librium at 1 atm pressure. Consider, for example, the vaporization of water:
H2O(l) 9: H2O(g)
where DH8 5 140.7 kJ, DS8 5 10.109 kJ/K. The temperature at which DG8 is zero is
T 5  40.7
0.109    T 5 373    K 5 1008C
This is, of course, the normal boiling point of water (the temperature at which liquid 
water is at equilibrium with vapor at 1 atm).
Pressure and Concentration
All of the free energy calculations to this point have involved the standard free energy 
change, DG8. It is possible, however, to write a general relation for the free energy change, 
DG, valid under any conditions. This relation is a relatively simple one, but we will not 
attempt to derive it. It says that
	
DG 5 DG8 1 RT ln Q	
(16.4)
The quantity Q that appears in this equation is the “reaction quotient” referred to in 
Chapter 12. It has the same mathematical form as the equilibrium constant, K; the differ-
ence is that the terms that appear in Q are arbitrary, initial pressures or concentrations 
rather than equilibrium values.
To use this general expression for DG, you need to express T in K, R in kilojoules per 
kelvin (8.31 3 1023 kJ/K). As far as Q is concerned, the general rules are as follows:
•	 gases enter as their partial pressures in atmospheres.
•	 species in aqueous solution enter as their molar concentrations.
•	 pure liquids or solids do not appear; neither does the solvent in a dilute solution.
As an example, consider the reaction of zinc with strong acid:
Zn(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2(g)

chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
As Example 16.7 implies, changes in pressure and/or concentration can have a con-
siderable effect on DG. Sometimes, when DG8 is close to zero, changing the pressure 
from 1 atm to some other value can change the direction of spontaneity. Consider, for 
example, the reaction at 3008C:
NH4Cl(s) 9: NH3(g) 1 HCl(g)        DG8 5 113.0 kJ
The positive sign of DG8 implies that ammonium chloride will not decompose at 3008C 
to give NH3 and HCl, both at 1 atm pressure. However, notice what happens if PNH3 5 PHCl 
5 0.10 atm, in which case Q 5 (0.10)2:
	
DG 5 DG8 1 RT ln(0.10)2
	
5 113.0 kJ 1 (8.31 3 1023) (573 kJ) (ln 0.010)
	
5 113.0 kJ 2 21.9 kJ 5 28.9 kJ
This means that NH3 and HCl can be formed, each at 0.10 atm pressure, by heating am-
monium chloride to 3008C.
Another example of how a change in concentration can change the direction of 
spontaneity involves the reaction
SrCrO4(s) 9: Sr21(aq) 1 CrO422(aq)        DG8 5 125.3 kJ at 258C
Because DG8 is a positive quantity, SrCrO4 does not dissolve spontaneously to form a 1 M 
solution at 258C (Figure 16.7). Suppose, however, the concentrations of Sr21 and CrO422 
are reduced to 0.0010 M:
	
DG 5 DG8 1 RT ln [Sr21][CrO422]
	
5 125.3 kJ 1 [(8.31 3 1023)(298)] kJ [ln (1.0 3 1023)2]
	
5 125.3 kJ 2 34.2 kJ 5 28.9 kJ
Strontium chromate should, and does, dissolve spontaneously to form a 0.0010 M water 
solution. As you might expect, its solubility at 258C lies between 1 M and 0.0010 M, at 
about 0.0060 M.
DG at 0.0060 M 5 125.3 kJ 1 RT ln (0.0060)2 5 0
16.6 The Free Energy Change and the 
Equilibrium Constant
Throughout this chapter we have stressed the relation between the free energy change 
and reaction spontaneity. For a reaction to be spontaneous at standard conditions (1 atm, 
1 M), DG8 must be negative. Another indicator of reaction spontaneity is the equilibrium 
constant, K; if K is greater than 1, the reaction is spontaneous at standard conditions. As 
you might suppose, the two quantities DG8 and K are related. The nature of that relation-
ship is readily deduced by starting with the general equation

Equation 16.5 is generally applicable to any system. The equilibrium constant may 
be the K referred to in our discussion of gaseous equilibrium (Chapter 12), or any of the 
solution equilibrium constants (Kw, Ka, Kb, Ksp,  .  .  .) discussed in subsequent chapters. 
Notice that DG8 is the standard free energy change (gases at 1 atm, species in solution at 
1 M). That is why, in the expression for K, gases enter as their partial pressures in atmo-
spheres and ions or molecules in solution as their molarities.

This is the value listed in Chapter 15 for Ksp of PbCl2.
The relationship DG8 5 2RT ln K allows us to relate the standard free energy change 
to the extent of reaction. Consider, for example, the simple equilibrium system
A(g) EF B(g)
at 258C. Figure 16.8 (page 516) shows how the extent of reaction varies with the value of 
DG8 for this system. Notice that
•	 if DG8 is greater than about 120 kJ, the equilibrium constant is so small that virtually 
no A is converted to B. We would say that, for all practical purposes, the reaction does 
not occur.

516
 
chapter sixteen  Spontaneity of Reaction
•	 if DG8 is less than about 220 kJ, the equilibrium constant is so large that virtually all 
of A is converted to B. In essence, the reaction goes to completion.
•	 only if DG8 lies between 120 kJ and 220 kJ will the equilibrium mixture contain ap-
preciable amounts of both A and B. In particular, if DG8 5 0, K 5 1 and the equilib-
rium system contains equal amounts of A and B.
16.7 Additivity of Free Energy Changes; Coupled 
Reactions
Free energy changes for reactions, like enthalpy or entropy changes, are additive. That is,
if Reaction 3 5 Reaction 1 1 Reaction 2
	
then DG3 5 DG1 1 DG2
This relation can be regarded as the free energy equivalent of Hess’s law (Chapter 8). To 
illustrate its application, consider the synthesis of CuCl2 from the elements
	
Cu(s) 1 1
2 Cl2(g) 9: CuCl(s)	
DG8 at 258C 5 2119.9 kJ
CuCl(s) 1 1
2 Cl2(g) 9: CuCl2(s)        DG8 at 258C 5 255.8 kJ
	
Cu(s) 1 Cl2(g) 9: CuCl2(s)
For the overall reaction, DG8 at 258C 5 2119.9 kJ 2 55.8 kJ 5 2175.7 kJ.
Because free energy changes are additive, it is often possible to bring about a non­
spontaneous reaction by coupling it with a reaction for which DG8 is a large negative 
number. As an example, consider the preparation of iron metal from hematite ore. The 
reaction
Fe2O3(s) 9: 2Fe(s) 1 3
2 O2(g)        DG8 at 258C 5 1742.2 kJ
is clearly nonspontaneous; even at temperatures as high as 20008C, DG8 is a positive 
quantity. Suppose, though, that this reaction is “coupled” with the spontaneous oxida-
tion of carbon monoxide:
CO(g) 1 1
2 O2(g) 9: CO2(g)        DG8 at 258C 5 2257.2 kJ
The overall reaction is spontaneous:
	
Fe2O3(s) 9: 2Fe(s) 1 3
2 O2(g)
	
3CO(g) 1 3
2 O2(g) 9: 3CO2(g)
Fe2O3(s) 1 3CO(g) 9: 2Fe(s) 1 3CO2(g)
For the coupled reaction at 258C,
DG8 5 1742.2 kJ 1 3(2257.2 kJ) 5 229.4 kJ
The negative sign of DG8 implies that although Fe2O3 does not spontaneously decom-
pose, it can be converted to iron by reaction with carbon monoxide. This is in fact the 
reaction used in the blast furnace when iron ore consisting mainly of Fe2O3 is reduced 
to iron (Chapter 20).
Coupled reactions are common in human metabolism. Spontaneous processes, 
such as the oxidation of glucose,

bring about a nonspontaneous reaction:

(16.6)
DG8 5 131 kJ at 258C
ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) are complex organic 
molecules (Figure 16.9, page 517) that, in essence, differ only by the presence of an extra

In a very real sense, your body “stores” energy available from the metabolism of 
foods in the form of ATP. This molecule in turn supplies the energy required for all sorts 
of biochemical reactions taking place in the body. It does this by reverting to ADP, that 
is, by reversing reaction 16.6. The amount of ATP consumed is amazingly large; a com-
petitive sprinter may hydrolyze as much as 500 g (about 1 lb) of ATP per minute.

Rubber Elasticity: An Entropic 
Phenomenon
Leslie Sperling, Lehigh University
Molecular Structure of Rubbery 
Materials
Along with such materials as plastics, adhesives, fi bers, 
and coatings, rubber is polymeric in nature. Such mate-
rials consist of long chains, with molecular masses gen-
erally of the order of 50,000 to 500,000 g/mol. 
Common rubbery materials—often called elastomers—
include automotive tires and rubber bands.
For a polymer to exhibit rubber elasticity, it must 
have two properties:
1. It must be crosslinked or vulcanized. Crosslinking is 
the chemical joining together of polymer chains, 
usually by sulfur bonds at random positions, to make 
a three-dimensional network (see Figure A).
2. It must be above its glass transition temperature, 
which means that the polymer chains have suﬃ  cient 
thermal energy to move freely. many rubbery mate-
rials have glass transition temperatures around 
200 K, below which they are glassy, like plastics.

How Does Entropy Apply to Elastomeric Materials?
Entropy is a measure of disorder in materials. Relaxed polymer 
chains with a random conformation (shape in space), like cooked 
spaghetti or a box of fishing worms, have a high degree of entropy, 
which is favored by Mother Nature. If the chains are 
stretched out (stressed), the number of conformations 
the chains can have in space is limited, and the entropy is 
reduced (see Figure B). The ratio of final length to initial 
length is denoted a.
For materials such as rubber bands, the quantity a 
may be as large as five. At that point, the chains are sub-
stantially fully extended. Further stretching may break 
the rubber band, actually severing the polymer chains at 
the break point (a chemical reaction!).
There is an interesting demonstration experiment 
that you can do with a rubber band, preferably a large 
and/or thick one. Touch the unstretched rubber band 
to your lips. Then, stretch the rubber band rapidly and 
immediately, retouch it to your lips. The rubber band 
will be warmer. This motion creates a thermodynamic 
cycle in which the system goes through a series of dif-
ferent states and then returns to its original state. The 
cycle acts as a heat engine.
The major applications of rubbery materials today include auto-
motive tires, rubber bands, tubing of various kinds, electric wire 
insulation, elastomeric urethane fibers for undergarments, and sili-
cone rubber. Such types of polymers are important materials in our 
twenty-first -century world.

lectrochemistry is the study of the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy. 
This conversion takes place in an electrochemical cell that may be a(n)
• voltaic (galvanic) cell (Section 17.1), in which a spontaneous reaction generates 
electrical energy.
• electrolytic cell (Section 17.5), in which electrical energy is used to bring about a 
non­spontaneous reaction.
All of the reactions considered in this chapter are of the oxidation-reduction type. You 
will recall from Chapter 4 that such a reaction can be split into two half-reactions. In one 
half-reaction, referred to as reduction, electrons are consumed; in the other, called oxida-
tion, electrons are produced. There can be no net change in the number of electrons; the 
number of electrons consumed in reduction must be exactly equal to the number produced 
in the oxidation half-reaction.

17.1  voltaic cells
In an electrochemical cell, these two half-reactions occur at two different electrodes, 
which most often consist of metal plates or wires. Reduction occurs at the cathode; a 
typical half-reaction might be
cathode:    Cu21(aq) 1 2e2 9: Cu(s)
Oxidation takes place at the anode, where a species such as zinc metal produces electrons:
anode:    Zn(s) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 2e2
It is always true that in an electrochemical cell, anions move to the anode; cations move to 
the cathode.
One of the most important characteristics of a cell is its voltage, which is a measure of 
reaction spontaneity. Cell voltages depend on the nature of the half-reactions occurring at the 
electrodes (Section 17.2) and on the concentrations of species involved (Section 17.4). From 
the voltage measured at standard concentrations, it is possible to calculate the standard free 
energy change and the equilibrium constant (Section 17.3) of the reaction involved.
The principles discussed in this chapter have a host of practical applications. Whenever 
you start your car, turn on your cell phone, or use a remote control for your television or 
other devices, you are making use of a voltaic cell. Many of the most important elements, 
including hydrogen and chlorine, are prepared in electrolytic cells. These applications, among 
others, are discussed in Section 17.6.
17.1 Voltaic Cells
In principle at least, any spontaneous redox reaction can serve as a source of energy in a 
voltaic (galvanic) cell. The cell must be designed in such a way that oxidation occurs at 
one electrode (anode) with reduction at the other electrode (cathode). The electrons 
produced at the anode must be transferred to the cathode, where they are consumed. To 
do this, the electrons move through an external circuit, where they do electrical work.
To understand how a voltaic cell operates, let us start with some simple cells that are 
readily made in the general chemistry laboratory.
The Zn-Cu21 Cell
When a piece of zinc is added to a water solution containing Cu21 ions, the following 
redox reaction takes place:
Zn(s) 1 Cu21(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 Cu(s)
In this reaction, copper metal plates out on the surface of the zinc. The blue color of the 
aqueous Cu21 ion fades as it is replaced by the colorless aqueous Zn21 ion (Figure 17.1).

chapter seventeen  Electrochemistry
Clearly, this redox reaction is spontaneous; it involves electron transfer from a Zn atom 
to a Cu21 ion.
To design a voltaic cell using the Zn-Cu21 reaction as a source of electrical energy, 
the electron transfer must occur indirectly; that is, the electrons given off by zinc atoms 
must be made to pass through an external electric circuit before they reduce Cu21 ions 
to copper atoms. Figure 17.2 shows one way to do this. The voltaic cell consists of two 
half-cells:
•	 a Zn anode dipping into a solution containing Zn21 ions, seen in the beaker at the far 
right.
•	 a Cu cathode dipping into a solution containing Cu21 ions (blue), seen in the other 
beaker in Figure 17.2.
The “external circuit” consists of a voltmeter with leads (red and black) to the anode and 
cathode.
Let us trace the flow of electric current through the cell.
	 1.	 At the zinc anode (connected to the red wire in Figure 17.2), electrons are produced 
by the oxidation half-reaction
Zn(s) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 2e2
This electrode, which “pumps” electrons into the external circuit, is ordinarily 
marked as the negative pole of the cell.
	 2.	 Electrons generated at the anode move through the external circuit (right to left in 
Figure 17.2) to the copper cathode, connected through the black wire to the voltme-
ter. At the cathode, the electrons are consumed, reducing Cu21 ions present in the 
solution around the electrode:
Cu21(aq) 1 2e2 9: Cu(s)
The copper electrode, which “pulls” electrons from the external circuit, is consid-
ered to be the positive pole of the cell.
	 3.	 As the above half-reactions proceed, a surplus of positive ions (Zn21) tends to build 
up around the zinc electrode. The region around the copper electrode tends to be-
come deficient in positive ions as Cu21 ions are consumed. To maintain electrical 
neutrality, cations must move toward the copper cathode or, alternatively, anions 
must move toward the zinc anode. In practice, both migrations occur.
In the cell in Figure 17.2, movement of ions occurs through a salt bridge connect-
ing the two beakers. The salt bridge is an inverted glass U-tube, plugged with glass 
wool at each end. The tube is filled with a solution of a salt that takes no part in the 
electrode reactions; potassium nitrate, KNO3, is frequently used. As current is drawn 
from the cell, K1 ions move from the salt bridge into the cathode half-cell. At the same 
time, NO32 ions move into the anode half-cell. In this way, electrical neutrality is 
Figure 17.2 A Zn-Cu21 voltaic cell. In 
this voltaic cell, a voltmeter (left) is con-
nected to a half-cell consisting of a Cu 
cathode in a solution of blue Cu21 ions 
and a half-cell consisting of a Zn anode 
in a solution of colorless Zn21 ions. The 
following spontaneous reaction takes 
place in this cell: Zn(s) 1 Cu21(aq) 9: 
Zn21(aq) 1 Cu(s). The salt bridge al-
lows ions to pass from one solution to 
the other to complete the circuit and 
prevents direct contact between Zn 
atoms and the Cu21 ions.
Charles D. Winters
The Zn electrode must not come 
in contact with Cu21 ions. Why?

maintained without Cu21 ions coming in contact with the Zn electrode, which would 
short-circuit the cell.
The cell in Figure 17.2 (page 528) is often abbreviated as
Zn u Zn21 i Cu21 u Cu
In this notation,
•	 the anode reaction (oxidation) is shown at the left. Zn atoms are oxidized to Zn21 
ions.
•	 the salt bridge (or other means of separating the half cells) is indicated by 
the symbol i.
•	 the cathode reaction (reduction) is shown at the right. Cu21 ions are re-
duced to Cu atoms.
•	 a single vertical line indicates a phase boundary, such as that between a 
solid electrode and an aqueous solution.
Notice that the anode half-reaction comes first in the cell notation, just as 
the letter a comes before c.
Other Salt Bridge Cells
Cells similar to that in Figure 17.2 can be set up for many different spontane-
ous redox reactions. Consider, for example, the reaction

This reaction, like that between Zn and Cu21, can serve as a source of electri-
cal energy in a voltaic cell. The cell is similar to the one in Figure 17.2 except 
that, in the anode compartment, a nickel electrode is surrounded by a solu-
tion of a nickel(II) salt, such as NiCl2 or NiSO4. The cell notation is Ni u Ni21 i 
Cu21 u Cu.
Another spontaneous redox reaction that can serve as a source of elec-
trical energy is that between zinc metal and Co31 ions:
Zn(s) 1 2Co31(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 2Co21(aq)
A voltaic cell using this reaction is similar to the Zn-Cu21 cell; the Zn u Zn21 
half-cell and the salt bridge are the same. Because no metal is involved in the 
cathode half-reaction, an inert electrode that conducts an electric current is used. Fre-
quently, the cathode is made of platinum (Figure 17.3). In the cathode, Co31 ions are 
provided by a solution of Co(NO3)3. The half-reactions occurring in the cell are

cell components that are in the same phase. The symbol Pt is used to indicate the pres-
ence of an inert platinum electrode. A single vertical line separates Pt (a solid) from the 
components of the half-cell, which are in the liquid phase.

To summarize our discussion of the structure of voltaic cells,
•	 a voltaic cell consists of two half-cells. They are joined by an external electric circuit 
through which electrons move and a salt bridge through which ions move.
•	 each half-cell consists of an electrode dipping into a water solution. If a metal partici-
pates in the cell reaction, either as a product or as a reactant, it is ordinarily used as 
the electrode; otherwise, an inert electrode such as platinum is used.
•	 in one half-cell, oxidation occurs at the anode; in the other, reduction takes place at the 
cathode. The overall cell reaction is the sum of the half-reactions taking place at the 
anode and cathode.

17.2  standard voltages
17.2 Standard Voltages
The driving force behind the spontaneous reaction in a voltaic cell is measured by the 
cell voltage, which is an intensive property, independent of the number of electrons 
passing through the cell. Cell voltage depends on the nature of the redox reaction and 
the concentrations of the species involved; for the moment, we’ll concentrate on the 
first of these factors.
The standard voltage for a given cell is that measured when the current flow is es-
sentially zero, all ions and molecules in solution are at a concentration of 1 M, and all 
gases are at a pressure of 1 atm. To illustrate, consider the Zn-H1 cell. Let us suppose 
that the half-cells are set up in such a way that the concentrations of Zn21 and H1 are 
both 1 M and the pressure of H2(g) is 1 atm. Under these conditions, the cell voltage at 
very low current flow is 10.762 V. This quantity is referred to as the standard voltage 
and is given the symbol E 8.
Zn(s) 1 2H1(aq, 1 M) 9: Zn21(aq, 1 M) 1 H2(g, 1 atm)        E8 5 10.762 V
E 8red and E 8ox
Any redox reaction can be split into two half-reactions, an oxidation and a reduction. It 
is possible to associate standard voltages E 8ox (standard oxidation voltage) and E 8red 
(standard reduction voltage) with the oxidation and reduction half-reactions. The stan-
dard voltage for the overall reaction, E8, is the sum of these two quantities
	
E8 5 E8red 1 E8ox	
(17.1)
To illustrate, consider the reaction between Zn and H1 ions, for which the standard volt-
age is 10.762 V.
10.762 V 5 E8red(H1 9: H2) 1 E8ox(Zn 9: Zn21)
There is no way to measure the standard voltage for a half-reaction; only E8 can be 
measured directly. To obtain values for E8ox and E8red, the value zero is arbitrarily 
assigned to the standard voltage for reduction of H1 ions to H2 gas:
2H1(aq, 1 M) 1 2e2 9: H2(g, 1 atm)        E8red(H1 9: H2) 5 0.000 V
Using this convention, it follows that the standard voltage for the oxidation of zinc must 
be 10.762 V; that is,
Zn(s) 9: Zn21(aq, 1 M) 1 2e2        E8ox(Zn 9: Zn21) 5 10.762 V
As soon as one half-reaction voltage is established, others can be calculated. For 
example, the standard voltage for the Zn-Cu21 cell shown in Figure 17.2 (page 528) is 
found to be 11.101 V. Knowing that E8ox for zinc is 10.762 V, it follows that
	
E8red(Cu21 9: Cu) 5 E8 2 E8ox(Zn 9: Zn21)
 
 
5 1.101 V 2 0.762 V 5 10.339 V
Standard half-cell voltages are ordinarily obtained from a list of standard potentials 
such as those in Table 17.1 (page 533). The potentials listed are the standard voltages for 
reduction half-reactions, that is,
standard potential 5 E8red
For example, the standard potentials listed in the table for Zn21 9: Zn and Cu21 9: 
Cu are 20.762 V and 10.339 V, respectively; it follows that at 258C
	
Zn21(aq, 1 M) 1 2e2 9: Zn(s)	
E8red 5 20.762 V
Cu21(aq, 1 M) 1 2e2 9: Cu(s)        E8red 5 10.339 V
To obtain the standard voltage for an oxidation half-reaction, all you have to do is 
change the sign of the standard potential listed in Table 17.1. For example, knowing that
	
Zn21(aq) 1 2e2 9: Zn(s)	
E8red 5 20.762 V
You need two half-cells to measure a 
voltage.

532
	
chapter seventeen  Electrochemistry
it follows that
Zn(s) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 2e2        E8ox 5 10.762 V
Again, we have
Cu21(aq) 1 2e2 9: Cu(s)        E8red 5 10.339 V
so,
Cu(s) 9: Cu21(aq) 1 2e2        E8ox 5 20.339 V
Another way to express this principle is to say that standard voltages for forward and 
reverse half-reactions are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.
Strength of Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
As pointed out in Chapter 4, an oxidizing agent is a species that can gain electrons; it is 
a reactant in a reduction half-reaction. Table 17.1 lists reduction half-reactions from left 
to right; it follows that oxidizing agents are in the left column of the table. All of the spe-
cies appearing in that column (Li1,  .  .  .  , F2) are, in principle, oxidizing agents. A 
“strong” oxidizing agent is one that has a strong attraction for electrons and hence can 
readily oxidize other species. In contrast, a “weak” oxidizing agent does not gain electrons 
readily. It is capable of reacting only with those species that are very easily oxidized.
The strength of an oxidizing agent is directly related to the standard voltage for its 
reduction, E8red. The more positive E8red is, the stronger the oxidizing agent. Looking at 
Table 17.1, you can see that oxidizing strength increases moving down the left column. 
The Li1 ion, at the top of that column, is a very weak oxidizing agent with a large nega-
tive reduction voltage (E8red 5 23.040 V). In practice, cations of the Group 1 metals 
(Li1, Na1, K1,   .  .  .) and the Group 2 metals (Mg21, Ca21,  .  .  .) never act as oxidizing 
agents in water solution.
Further down the left column of Table 17.1, the H1 ion (E8red 5 0.000 V) is a reason-
ably strong oxidizing agent. It is capable of oxidizing many metals, including magne-
sium and zinc:
Mg(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Mg21(aq) 1 H2(g)    E8 5 12.357 V
	
Zn(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2(g)	
E8 5 10.762 V
The strongest oxidizing agents are those at the bottom of the left column. Species 
such as Cr2O722 (E8red 5 11.33 V) and Cl2 (E8red 5 11.360 V) are commonly used as oxi-
dizing agents in the laboratory. The fluorine molecule, at the bottom of the left column, 
should be the strongest of all oxidizing agents. In practice, fluorine is seldom used as an 
oxidizing agent in water solution. The F2 molecule takes electrons away from just about 
anything, including water, often with explosive violence.
The arguments we have just gone through can be applied, in reverse, to reducing 
agents, which are in the column to the right of Table 17.1 (Li,  .  .  .  , F2). In principle, 
at least, all of them can supply electrons to another species in a redox reaction. Their 
strength as reducing agents is directly related to their E8ox values. The more positive E8ox 
is, the stronger the reducing agent. Looking at the values, and remembering that 
E8ox 5 2E8red,
	
Li(s) 9: Li1(aq) 1 e2	
E8ox 5 13.040 V
	
H2(g) 9: 2H1(aq) 1 2e2    E8ox 5    0.000 V
	
2F2(aq) 9: F2(g) 1 2e2	
E8ox 5 22.889 V
It should be clear that reducing strength decreases moving down the table. Actually, 
the five metals at the top of the right column (Li, K, Ba, Ca, Na) cannot be used as 
reducing agents in water solution because they react directly with water, reducing it to 
hydrogen gas:

Calculation of E  8 from E  8red and E  8ox
As pointed out earlier, the standard voltage for a redox reaction is the sum of the stan-
dard voltages of the two half-reactions, reduction and oxidation; that is,
E8 5 E8red 1 E8ox
This simple relation makes it possible, using Table 17.1, to calculate the standard voltages 
for more than 3000 different redox reactions.

17.2  standard voltages
Example 17.3 illustrates two general points concerning cell voltages.
	 1.	 The calculated voltage, E8, is always a positive quantity for a reaction taking place in 
a voltaic cell.
 2. The quantities E8, E8ox, and E8red are independent of how the equation for the cell 
reaction is written. You never multiply the voltage by the coefficients of the bal-
anced equation.
Spontaneity of Redox Reactions
To determine whether a given redox reaction is spontaneous, apply a simple principle:
If the calculated voltage for a redox reaction is a positive quantity, the reaction will 
be spontaneous. If the calculated voltage is negative, the reaction is not 
spontaneous.
Ordinarily, this principle is applied at standard concentrations (1 atm for gases, 1 M 
for species in aqueous solution). Hence it is the sign of E8 that serves as the criterion for 
spontaneity. To show how this works, consider the problem of oxidizing nickel metal to 
Ni21 ions. This cannot be accomplished by using 1 M Zn21 ions:
Ni(s) 1 Zn21(aq, 1 M) 9: Ni21(aq, 1 M) 1 Zn(s)
E8 5 E8ox Ni 1 E8red Zn21 5 10.236 V 2 0.762 V 5 20.526 V
Sure enough, if you immerse a bar of nickel in a solution of 1 M ZnSO4, nothing hap-
pens. Suppose, however, you add the nickel bar to a solution of 1 M CuSO4 (Figure 17.5;

strategy
1.	 Assign oxidation numbers to each element so you can decide which element is reduced and which one is oxidized.
2.	 Write the oxidation and reduction half-­reactions together with the corresponding E8ox and E8red. Recall that 
E8ox 5 2(E8red).
3.	 Add both half-­reactions (make sure you cancel electrons) and take the sum of E8ox and E8red to obtain E8 for the cell.

strategy and solution
E8 for the cell does not change. It does not matter what you choose to be E8red of the half-­reaction. Naturally, E8ox will also 
change and you cannot choose to change that.
If you choose E8red to be zero, then
    E8red 1 E8ox 5 1.201 V
    0 1 E8ox 5 1.201 V; E8ox for the half-­reaction Cd(s) !: Cd21(aq) 1 2e2 5 1.201 V
Since E8red for Cd21 is asked for, then E8red 5 2(E8ox) 5 21.201 V

It would be nice if you could double 
the voltage by rewriting the equation, 
but you can’t.
Since you add to obtain E 8, it makes no 
difference which you write first, E 8red

17.3 Relations Between E 8, DG 8, and K
As pointed out previously, the value of the standard cell voltage, E8, is a measure of the 
spontaneity of a cell reaction. In Chapter 16, we showed that the standard free energy 
change, DG8, is a general criterion for reaction spontaneity. As you might suppose, these 
two quantities have a simple relation to one another and to the equilibrium constant,  
K, for the cell reaction.
E 8 and DG 8
It can be shown by a thermodynamic argument that we will not go through here that 
these two quantities are related by the equation
	
DG8 5 2nFE8	
(17.2)
where
•	 DG8 is the standard free energy change (gases at 1 atm, species in solution at 1 M) for 
the reaction.
•	 E8 is the standard voltage for the cell reaction.
•	 n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction.
•	 F, called the Faraday constant, has the following value: 9.648 3 104 J/mol · V 
(J 5 joule, V 5 volt).
Notice from this equation that DG8 and E8 have opposite signs. This is reasonable; a 
spontaneous reaction is one for which DG8 is negative but E8 is positive.
E 8 and K
Redox reactions, like all reactions, eventually reach a state of equilibrium. It is possible 
to calculate the equilibrium constant for a redox reaction from the standard voltage. To 
do that, we start with the relation obtained in Chapter 16:
DG8 5 2RT ln K
We have just seen that DG8 5 2nFE8. It follows that

chapter seventeen  Electrochemistry
The approach used in Example 17.5 to find the number of moles of electrons trans-
ferred, n, is generally useful. What you do is to break down the equation for the cell reac-
tion into two half-equations, oxidation and reduction. The quantity n is the number of 
electrons appearing in either half-equation.
Table 17.2 lists values of K and DG8 corresponding to various values of E8 with n 5 2. 
Notice that:
•	 if E8 is greater than about 10.10 V, K is very large, and the reaction goes virtually to 
completion.
•	 if E8 is smaller than about 20.10 V, K is very small, so the reaction does not proceed 
to any appreciable extent.
Only if the standard voltage falls within a rather narrow range, say 10.10 to 20.10 V, 
will the value of K (and that of DG8) be such that the reaction will produce an equilibrium 
mixture containing appreciable amounts of both reactants and products.
17.4 Effect of Concentration on Voltage
To this point, we have dealt only with “standard” voltages, that is, voltages when all gases 
are at 1 atm pressure and all species in aqueous solution are at a concentration of 1 M. 
When the concentration of a reactant or product changes, the voltage changes as well.

17.4  effect of concentration on voltage
Qualitatively, the direction in which the voltage shifts is readily predicted when you real-
ize that cell voltage is directly related to reaction spontaneity.
	 1.	 Voltage will increase if the concentration of a reactant is increased or that of a prod-
uct is decreased. Either of these changes increases the driving force behind the re-
dox reaction, making it more spontaneous.
	 2.	 Voltage will decrease if the concentration of a reactant is decreased or that of a prod-
uct is increased. Either of these changes makes the redox reaction less 
spontaneous.
When a voltaic cell operates, supplying electrical energy, the concentration of reac-
tants decreases and that of the products increases. As time passes, the voltage drops 
steadily. Eventually it becomes zero, and we say that the cell is “dead.” At that point, the 
redox reaction taking place within the cell is at equilibrium, and there is no driving force 
to produce a voltage.
Nernst Equation
To obtain a quantitative relation between cell voltage and concentration, it is convenient 
to start with the general expression for the free energy change discussed in Chapter 16:
DG 5 DG8 1 RT ln Q
where Q is the reaction quotient in which products appear in the numerator, reactants in 
the denominator. But DG8 5 2nFE8 and DG 5 2nFE, so we have
2nFE 5 2nFE8 1 RT ln Q
Solving for the cell voltage E,
E 5 E8 2 RT
nF ln Q
This relationship is known as the Nernst equation, after Walther Nernst (1864–1941), a 
brilliant and egocentric colleague of Arrhenius, who first proposed it in 1888. Recalling 
that, at 258C, the quantity RT/F is 0.0257 V,
	
E 5 E8 2 
10.0257 V2
n
 ln Q	
at 25°C	
(17.4)
In this equation, E is the cell voltage, E8 is the standard voltage, n is the number of moles 
of electrons exchanged in the reaction, and Q is the reaction quotient. Notice that:
•	 if Q . 1, which means that the concentrations of products are high relative to those of 
reactants, ln Q is positive and E , E8.
•	 if Q , 1 (concentrations of products low relative to reactants), ln Q is negative and 
E . E8.
•	 if Q 5 1, as is the case under standard conditions, ln Q 5 0 and E 5 E8.
Remember that gases enter Q as their partial pressures in atmospheres. Species in 
water solution enter as their molar concentrations. Pure liquids and solids do not appear 
in the expression for Q. For example,
aA(s) 1 bB(aq) 9: cC(aq) 1 dD(g)        Q 5 
3C4c1PD2 d
3B4b
That’s what happens when you leave 
your car lights on, unless your car 
turns them off automatically.
Nernst won the Nobel Prize in Chem-
istry in 1920.

termination of the concentrations of ions in solution. Suppose you measure the cell volt-
age E and know the concentration of all but one species in the two half-cells. It should 
then be possible to calculate the concentrations of that species by using the Nernst equa-

chapter seventeen  Electrochemistry
As Example 17.7 implies, the ZnuZn21H1uH2uPt cell can be used to mea-
sure the concentration of H1 or pH of a solution. Indeed, cells of this type are 
commonly used to measure pH; Figure 17.7 shows a schematic diagram of a 
cell used with a pH meter. The pH meter, referred to in Chapter 13, is actually 
a high-resistance voltmeter calibrated to read pH rather than voltage. The cell 
connected to the pH meter consists of two half-cells. One of these is a refer-
ence half-cell of known voltage. The other half-cell contains a solution of 
known pH separated by a thin, fragile glass electrode from a solution whose 
pH is to be determined. The voltage of this cell is a function of the pH of the 
solution in the beaker.
Specific ion electrodes, similar in design to the glass electrode, have been 
developed to analyze for a variety of cations and anions. One of the first to be 
used extensively was a fluoride ion electrode that is sensitive to F2 at concen-
trations as low as 0.1 part per million and hence is ideal for monitoring fluo-
ridated water supplies. An electrode that is specific for Cl2 ions is used to 
diagnose cystic fibrosis. Attached directly to the skin, it detects the abnor-
mally high concentrations of sodium chloride in sweat that are a characteris-
tic symptom of this disorder. Diagnoses that used to require an hour or more 
can now be carried out in a few minutes; as a result, large numbers of chil-
dren can be screened rapidly and routinely.
The general approach illustrated by Example 17.7 is widely used to deter-
mine equili­brium constants for solution reactions. The pH meter in particular 
can be used to determine acid or base equilibrium constants by measuring the 
pH of solutions containing known concentrations of weak acids or bases. Specific ion 
electrodes are readily adapted to the determination of solubility product constants. For 
example, a chloride ion electrode can be used to find [Cl2] in equilibrium with AgCl(s) 
and a known [Ag1]. From that information, Ksp of AgCl can be calculated.
17.5 Electrolytic Cells
In an electrolytic cell, a nonspontaneous redox reaction is made to occur by pumping 
electrical energy into the system. A general diagram for such a cell is shown in Figure 
17.8 (page 545). The storage battery at the left provides a source of direct electric current. 
From the terminals of the battery, two wires lead to the electrolytic cell. This consists of 
two electrodes, A and C, dipping into a solution containing ions M1 and X2.

17.5  electrolytic cells
The battery acts as an electron pump, pushing electrons into the cathode, C, and 
removing them from the anode, A. To maintain electrical neutrality, some process 
within the cell must consume electrons at C and liberate them at A. This process is an 
oxidation-reduction reaction; when carried out in an electrolytic cell, it is called elec-
trolysis. At the cathode, an ion or molecule undergoes reduction by accepting electrons. 
At the anode, electrons are produced by the oxidation of an ion or molecule.
Quantitative Relationships
There is a simple relationship between the amount of electricity passed 
through an electrolytic cell and the amounts of substances produced by oxi-
dation or reduction at the electrodes. From the balanced half-equations
Ag1(aq) 1 e2 9: Ag(s)
Cu21(aq) 1 2e2 9: Cu(s)
Au31(aq) 1 3e2 9: Au(s)

Relations of this type, obtained from balanced half-equations, can be 
used in many practical calculations involving electrolytic cells. You will also 
need to become familiar with certain electrical units, including those of
quantity of electrical charge. The common unit here is the coulomb, C. The cou-
lomb is related to the charge carried by a mole of electrons through the Faraday 
constant:

chapter seventeen  Electrochemistry
In working Example 17.8, we have in effect assumed that the electrolyses were 
100% efficient in converting electrical energy into chemical energy. In practice, this is 
almost never the case. Some electrical energy is wasted in side reactions at the elec-
trodes and in the form of heat. This means that the actual yield of products is less than 
the theoretical yield.
Cell Reactions (Water Solution)
As is always the case, a reduction half-reaction occurs at the cathode of an electrolytic 
cell. This half-reaction in aqueous solution may be
•	 the reduction of a cation to the corresponding metal. This commonly occurs with tran-
sition metal cations, which are relatively easy to reduce. Examples include
	
Ag1(aq) 1 e2 9: Ag(s)	
E8red 5 10.799 V
Cu21(aq) 1 2e2 9: Cu(s)    E8red 5 10.339 V
	
This type of half-reaction is characteristic of electroplating processes, in which a met-
al object serves as the cathode (Figure 17.9).
•	 the reduction of a water molecule to hydrogen gas
2H2O 1 2e2 9: H2(g) 1 2 OH2(aq)        E8red 5 20.828 V
	
This half-reaction commonly occurs when the cation in solution is very difficult to 
reduce. For example, electrolysis of a solution containing K1 ions (E8red 5 22.936 V) 
or Na1 ions (E8red 5 22.714 V) yields hydrogen gas at the cathode (Table 17.4).
Nobody is 100% efficient.

At the anode of an electrolytic cell, the half-reaction may be
•	 the oxidation of an anion to the corresponding nonmetal

•	 the oxidation of a water molecule to oxygen gas
2H2O 9: O2(g) 1 4H1(aq) 1 4e2        E8ox 5 21.229 V
This half-reaction occurs when the anion cannot be oxidized. Examples include nitrate 
and sulfate anions, where the nonmetal present is already in its highest oxidation state 
(15 for N, 16 for S).
17.6 Commercial Cells
To a chemist, electrochemical cells are of interest primarily for the information they 
yield concerning the spontaneity of redox reactions, the strengths of oxidizing and re-
ducing agents, and the concentrations of trace species in solution. The viewpoint of an 
engineer is somewhat different; applications of electrolytic cells in electroplating and 
electrosynthesis are of particular importance. To the nonscientist, electrochemistry is 
important primarily because of commercial voltaic cells, which supply the electrical en-
ergy for instruments ranging in size from pacemakers to automobiles.
Electrolysis of Aqueous NaCl
From a commercial standpoint, the most important electrolysis carried out in water 
solution is that of sodium chloride (Figure 17.10, page 550). At the anode, Cl2 ions are 
oxidized to chlorine gas:
anode:        2Cl2(aq) 9: Cl2(g) 1 2e2
At the cathode, the half-reaction involves H2O molecules, which are easier to reduce 
(E8red 5 20.828 V) than Na1 ions (E8red 5 22.714 V).
cathode:        2H2O 1 2e2 9: H2(g) 1 2 OH2(aq)

Electrolysis of potassium iodide (KI) solution. The electrolysis of 
aqueous KI is similar to that of aqueous NaCl. The cathode reaction (left) 
is the reduction of water to H2(g) and OH2, as shown by the pink color of 
phenolphthalein indicator in the water. The anode reaction (right) is the 
oxidation of I2(aq) to I2(aq), as shown by the brown color of the solution.

chapter seventeen  Electrochemistry
To obtain the overall cell reaction, add the half-reactions:
2Cl2(aq) 1 2H2O 9: Cl2(g) 1 H2(g) 1 2 OH2(aq)
Chlorine gas bubbles out of solution at the anode. At the cathode, hydrogen gas is 
formed, and the solution around the electrode becomes strongly basic.
The products of this electrolysis have a variety of uses. Chlorine is used to purify 
drinking water; large quantities of it are consumed in making plastics such as polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC). Hydrogen, prepared in this and many other industrial processes, is used 
chiefly in the synthesis of ammonia (Chapter 12). Sodium hydroxide (lye), obtained on 
evaporation of the electrolyte, is used in processing pulp and paper, in the purification of 
aluminum ore, in the manufacture of glass and textiles, and for many other purposes.
Primary (Nonrechargeable) Voltaic Cells
The construction of the ordinary dry cell (Leclanché cell) used in flashlights is 
shown in Figure 17.11. The zinc wall of the cell is the anode. The graphite rod 
through the center of the cell is the cathode. The space between the electrodes 
is filled with a moist paste. This contains MnO2, ZnCl2, and NH4Cl. When the 
cell operates, the half-reaction at the anode is
Zn(s) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 2e2
At the cathode, manganese dioxide is reduced to species in which Mn is in the 
13 oxidation state, such as Mn2O3:
2MnO2(s) 1 2NH41(aq) 1 2e2 9: Mn2O3(s) 1 2NH3(aq) 1 H2O
The overall reaction occurring in this voltaic cell is
Zn(s) 1 2MnO2(s) 1 2NH41(aq) 9: 
Zn21(aq) 1 Mn2O3(s) 1 2NH3(aq) 1 H2O
If too large a current is drawn from a Leclanché cell, the ammonia forms 
a gaseous insulating layer around the carbon cathode. When this happens, the 
voltage drops sharply and then returns slowly to its normal value of 1.5 V. This 
problem can be avoided by using an alkaline dry cell, in which the paste be-
tween the electrodes contains KOH rather than NH4Cl. In this case the overall 
cell reaction is simply

17.6  CommERCial CEllS
No gas is produced. Th e alkaline dry cell, although more expensive than the Leclanché 
cell, has a longer shelf life and provides more current.
Another important primary battery is the mercury cell. It usually comes in very 
small sizes and is used in hearing aids, watches, cameras, and some calculators. Th e an-
ode of this cell is a zinc-mercury amalgam; the reacting species is zinc. Th e cathode is a 
plate made up of mercury(II) oxide, HgO. Th e electrolyte is a paste containing HgO and 
sodium or potassium hydroxide. Th e electrode reactions are
 
anode: 
Zn(s) 1 2 OH2(aq) 9: Zn(OH)2(s) 1 2e2
 
cathode: 
HgO(s) 1 H2O 1 2e2 9: Hg(l) 1 2 OH2(aq)
 
 
Zn(s) 1 HgO(s) 1 H2O 9: Zn(OH)2(s) 1 Hg(l)
Notice that the overall reaction does not involve any ions in solution, so there are no 
concentration changes when current is drawn. As a result, the battery maintains a con-
stant voltage of about 1.3 V throughout its life.
Storage (Rechargeable) Voltaic Cells
A storage cell, unlike an ordinary dry cell, can be recharged repeatedly. Th is can be ac-
complished because the products of the reaction are deposited directly on the electrodes. 
By passing a current through a storage cell, it is possible to reverse the electrode reac-
tions and restore the cell to its original condition.
The laws of electrolysis were discovered 
by Michael Faraday, perhaps the most tal-
ented experimental scientist of the nine-
teenth century. Faraday lived his entire life 
in what is now greater london. The son of 
a blacksmith, he had no formal education 
beyond the rudiments of reading, writing, 
and arithmetic. Apprenticed to a book-
binder at the age of 13, Faraday educated 
himself by reading virtually every book that 
came into the shop. One that particularly 
impressed him was a textbook, Conversa-
tions in Chemistry, written by Mrs. Jane 
Marcet. Anxious to escape a life of drudg-
ery as a tradesman, Faraday wrote to Sir 
humphry davy at the Royal Institution, re-
questing employment. Shortly afterward, a 
vacancy arose, and Faraday was hired as a 
laboratory assistant.
davy 
quickly 
recognized 
Faraday’s 
talents and as time passed allowed him to 
work more and more independently. In his 
years with davy, Faraday published papers 
covering almost every fi eld of chemistry. 
They included studies on the condensation 
of gases (he was the fi rst to liquefy 
ammonia), the reaction of silver compounds 
with ammonia, and the isolation of several 
organic compounds, the most important of 
which was benzene. In 1825, Faraday began 
a series of lectures at the Royal Institution 
that were brilliantly successful. That same 
year he succeeded davy as director of the 
laboratory. As Faraday’s reputation grew, it 
was said that “humphrey davy’s greatest 
discovery was Michael Faraday.” Perhaps it 
was witticisms of this sort that led to an es-
trangement between master and protégé. 
late in his life, davy opposed Faraday’s 
nomination as a Fellow of the Royal Society 
and is reputed to have cast the only vote 
against him.
To Michael Faraday, science was an ob-
session;  one of his biographers described 
him as a “work maniac.” An observer 
(Faraday had no students) said of him,
. . . if he had to cross the laboratory for 
anything, he did not walk, he ran; the 
quickness of his perception was 
equalled by the calm rapidity of his 
movements.
In 1839, he suff ered a nervous breakdown, 
the result of overwork. For much of the 
rest of his life, Faraday was in poor health. 
he gradually gave up more and more of his 
social engagements but continued to do 
research at the same pace as before.
Faraday developed the laws of electrol-
ysis between 1831 and 1834. In mid-
december of 1833, he began a quantitative 
study of the electrolysis of several metal 
cations, including Sn21, Pb21, and Zn21. 
despite taking a whole day off  for Christ-
mas, he managed to complete these ex-
periments, write up the results of three 
years’ work, and get his paper published in 
the Philosophic Transactions of the Royal 
Society on January 9, 1834. In this paper, 
Faraday introduced the basic vocabulary of 
electrochemistry, using for the fi rst time 
the terms “anode,” “cathode,” “ion,” “elec-
trolyte,” and “electrolysis.”

Lead Storage Battery
The rechargeable 12-V lead storage battery used in automobiles consists of six voltaic 
cells of the type shown in Figure 17.12. A group of lead plates, the grids of which are filled 
with spongy gray lead, forms the anode of the cell. The multiple cathode consists of an-
other group of plates of similar design filled with lead(IV) oxide, PbO2. These two sets of 
plates alternate through the cell. They are immersed in a water solution of sulfuric acid, 
H2SO4, which acts as the electrolyte.
When a lead storage battery is supplying current, the lead in the anode grids is oxi-
dized to Pb21 ions, which precipitate as PbSO4. At the cathode, lead dioxide is reduced 
to Pb21 ions, which also precipitate as PbSO4.

DG8 5 2371.4 kJ (258C)
Deposits of lead sulfate slowly build up on the plates, partially covering and replacing the 
lead and lead dioxide.
To recharge a lead storage battery, a direct current is passed through it in the proper 
direction so as to reverse the above reaction. In an automobile, the energy required to 
carry out the recharging comes from the engine.
When the battery is charged, some water may be electrolyzed:
2H2O 9: 2H2(g) 1 O2(g)        DG8 at 258C 5 474.4 kJ
The hydrogen and oxygen produced create a safety hazard. Beyond that, they can cause 
Pb, PbO2, and PbSO4 to flake off the plates. In a modern “maintenance-free” battery, the 
lead plates are alloyed with small amounts of calcium, which inhibits the electrolysis 
reaction.
One of the advantages of the lead storage battery is that its voltage stays constant at 
2 V per cell over a wide range of sulfuric acid concentrations. Only when the battery is 
nearly completely discharged does the voltage drop. It is also true that the cell voltage is 
virtually independent of temperature. You have trouble starting your car on a cold morn-
ing because the conductivity of the electrolyte drops off sharply with temperature; the 
voltage is still 2 V per cell at 2408C.

A 12-V storage battery can deliver 
300 A for a minute or so.

17.6  commercial cells
Nickel-­Based Batteries
Nickel-­cadmium (Nicad) batteries have an anode of solid cadmium and a cathode of 
solid nickeloxy hydroxide, NiO(OH). Aqueous potassium hydroxide is often used as an 
electrolyte. The reaction taking place in the cell is
	
anode:	
Cd(s) 1 2 OH2(aq) !: Cd(OH)2(s) 1 2e2
cathode: 2NiO(OH)(s) 1 2H2O 1 2e2 !: 2Ni(OH)2(s) 1 2 OH2(aq)
The battery produces about 1.3 V. As the battery is used, solid hydroxides of nickel and 
cadmium are deposited on the electrode. When the battery is recharged by a current it 
runs in the opposite direction, where the hydroxides of nickel and cadmium regenerate 
Cd and NiO(OH). Nicad batteries are a popular choice for emergency medical equip-
ment and power tools.
Nicad batteries have been popular for many years but are being replaced by the 
nickel-­metal hydride, NiMH, battery. This is because of the toxicity of cadmium and the 
difficulty of disposal for Nicad batteries.
In nickel-­metal hydride batteries, the cathode is also nickeloxy hydroxide. The an-
ode is a metal hydride, MH, where the “metal” is not a single element but an alloy of 
several metals. The half-­reactions for this battery are
	
anode:	
MH(s) 1 OH2(aq) !: M(s) 1 H2O 1 e2
cathode: NiO(OH)(s) 1 H2O 1 e2 !: Ni(OH)2(s) 1 OH2(aq)
Besides being environmentally friendlier than Nicad batteries, nickel-­metal hydride 
batteries have a higher energy content per unit mass. This is called the battery’s energy 
density with units expressed in watt-­hour/kg. These batteries are commonly used in hy-
brid electric cars and buses.
Lithium-­Ion (Li-­Ion) Batteries
The latest type of rechargeable battery is the lithium-­ion battery. The reaction taking 
place in the cell is more complicated than in either the lead storage battery or the nickel-­
based batteries. Suffice it to say that lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode. 
The anode is made up of carbon layers in which lithium ions are embedded. The cathode 
is a lithium metal oxide like LiCoO2. The electrolyte is a lithium salt in an organic 
solvent.
These batteries have a number of advantages. Lithium is the lightest metal (d 5 
0.53 g/cm3) and extremely reactive. These characteristics translate into a high-energy 
density. A typical Li-­ion battery can store 150 watt-­hours in 1 kg of battery. In compari-
son, NiMH batteries can store 80 Wh/kg while a lead storage battery can store  
2.5 Wh/kg. Li-­ion batteries hold their charge, losing only about 5% a month, whereas 
NiMH batteries lose about 20% per month. Li-­ion batteries also have no memory effect, 
which means that you do not have to completely discharge them before recharging. 
However, if you completely discharge a Li-­ion battery, it is ruined. The biggest disadvan-
tage to the consumer is its cost and limited life span.
Li-­ion batteries are used when light weight and high energy density are required. 
They are commonly used in cell phones, laptops, and digital cameras.
Fuel Cells
A fuel cell is a voltaic cell in which a fuel, usually hydrogen, is oxidized at the anode. At 
the cathode, oxygen is reduced. The reaction taking place in the alkaline fuel cells used 
in the space program since the 1960s is
	
anode:	
2H2(g) 1 4 OH2(aq) 9: 4H2O 1 4e2

DG8 at 258C 5 2474.4 kJ
Using a platinum catalyst, this reaction can now be carried out at temperatures as low as 
408C. The hydrogen used must be very pure; traces of carbon monoxide can poison the 
catalyst.

Chapter seventeen  Electrochemistry
Current research on fuel cells is directed toward the replacement of the internal 
combustion engine. To do this, hydrogen must be stored in the vehicle and replenished 
from time to time at “fi lling stations.” Th ree kilograms of hydrogen should be enough to 
drive a small car 500 km (300 miles) between fi ll-ups.
Th e rationale for using a hydrogen fuel cell is that the cell reaction produces only 
water. In contrast, your car’s engine produces small amounts of air pollutants such as NO 
and copious amounts of CO2, which contributes to global warming. On the other hand, 
there are a couple of deterrents to the use of fuel cells, i.e.
• the cost per kilojoule of energy is higher than with a gasoline- or diesel-powered engine.
• the storage of hydrogen in a vehicle is a serious problem. To carry three kilograms of 
hydrogen as a compressed gas at 200 atm (3000 psi) requires a heavy tank with a 
volume of 200 L (50 gallons). Liquid hydrogen requires a smaller tank, but its ex-
tremely low critical temperature (22408C) creates all sorts of problems. Another pos-
sibility is to convert hydrogen reversibly to a transition metal hydride (e.g., TiH2). It’s 
hard to say at this point how well that would work. All in all, it is almost certain that 
your next car will not use hydrogen as a fuel.
Fuel cells have been around for about 
50 years.
Fuel Cells: The Next Step in Chemical-to-
Electrical-Energy Conversion?
Steven R. Shaw, Montana State University
Fuel cells have attracted considerable interest because of their po-
tential for effi  cient conversion of the energy (DG ) from a chemical 
reaction to electrical energy (DE ). This effi  ciency is achieved by 
directly converting chemical energy to electricity. Conventional 
systems burn fuel in an engine and convert the resulting mechanical 
output to electrical power. Potential applications include station-
ary multi-megawatt power plants, battery replacements for per-
sonal electronics, and even fuel-cell-powered unmanned autono-
mous vehicles (uAVs).
The diff erent types of fuel cells depend on the electrolytes 
used and the temperatures at which the electrolytes operate. One 
popular fuel cell that operates at low temperatures (808C) used a 
polymer-electrolyte membrane, also known as a proton-exchange 
membrane (PeM). This membrane is made of a fl uorinated 
polymer, like Tefl on, that is highly conductive to electrons. It allows 
an energetically favorable reaction (DG , 0) between the fuel gas 
and oxidant to be spatially confi ned, so that the electrons evolving 
from and consumed by the half-cell reactions can do work in an 
external circuit. Figure A shows a schematic of a hydrogen/oxygen 
fuel cell with a proton-exchange membrane.
The half-cell reactions supported by this structure are
h2 9: 2e2 1 2h1
2h1 1 2e2 1 1
2 O2 9: h2O
Taken together, the overall reaction is simply the energetically 
favorable oxidation of hydrogen.

  chemistry beyond the classroom
Unlike burning hydrogen in air, in a fuel cell the electrolyte parti-
tions the overall reaction into half-cell reactions on either side of 
the cell. Hydrogen ions flow through the membrane, but since the 
electrolyte is nonconductive to electrons, it forces the electrons to 
flow through an external electrical circuit to complete the reaction. 
This flow of electrons can be harnessed to do useful work, such as 
illuminating a light bulb or running a laptop. The voltage at the ter-
minals of a single cell is rather small, on the order of a volt, so in 
applications a number of cells are usually connected in series to 
form a fuel cell “stack.”
Although it is attractive to directly convert chemical energy to 
electricity, PEM fuel cells face significant practical obstacles. Ex-
pensive heavy metals like platinum are typically used as catalysts to 
reduce energy barriers associated with the half-cell reactions. PEM 
fuel cells also cannot use practical hydrocarbon fuels like diesel 
without complicated preprocessing steps. Those significantly in-
crease the complexity of the overall system. At this time, it appears 
likely that PEM fuel cells will be confined to niche applications 
where high cost and special fuel requirements are tolerable.
On the other hand, high-temperature fuel cells, which  
work at 8008C, offer some significant advantages over low-
temperature cells like PEMs. One of their principal advantages 
is the potential to use more practical hydrocarbon fuels such as 
methane, or even mixtures of gasoline and diesel. This feature 
avoids the need for the “new energy infrastructure” sometimes 
associated with hydrogen fuel cells. Another advantage is the 
lower cost of the catalysts needed for the operation of a high-
temperature fuel cell. As an added benefit, the exhaust gases 
are hot enough for secondary energy recovery. For example, 
“waste heat” from a high-temperature fuel cell can supply 
energy needed to convert conventional hydrocarbon fuels into 
simpler components (like carbon monoxide and hydrogen)  
that work efficiently in the fuel cell. The exhaust of a high- 
temperature fuel cell can also be used to drive a conventional 
turbine and generator in what is called a combined cycle or 
hybrid system. Some high-temperature fuel-cell test installa-
tions use the exhaust to heat nearby buildings.
One leading prototype of a high-temperature fuel cell is the 
solid oxide fuel cell, or SOFC. The basic principle of the SOFC, 
like the PEM, is to use an electrolyte layer with high ionic conduc-
tivity but very small electronic conductivity. Figure B shows a 
schematic illustration of a SOFC fuel cell using carbon monoxide 
as fuel.
Unlike the PEM, the ionic conduction occurs for the oxygen ion 
instead of the hydrogen ion. SOFCs are made of ceramic materials 
like zirconium (Z 5 40) stabilized by yttrium (Z 5 39). High-
temperature oxygen conductivity is achieved by creating oxygen 
vacancies in the lattice structure of the electrolyte material. The 
half-cell reactions in this case are
1
2 O2 1 2e2 9: O22
O22 1 CO 9: CO2 1 2e2
Note that the overall reaction 
1
2 O2(g) 1 CO(g) 9: CO2(g)
is the oxidation of CO, but the fuel cell’s materials partition the re-
action so that the electrons flow through an external circuit and 
perform useful work.
Figure C shows an electron photomicrograph of a broken 
planar SOFC. The thick portion on the left is the porous anode 
structure. This is an anode-supported cell, meaning that in addition 
to collecting current and supporting the anode reaction, the anode 
layer stiffens the whole cell. The layer on the right is the cathode, 
and the interface between the two is the thin electrolyte. One of 
the challenges of this design is to ensure that the rates of expan-
sion of the cathode and the anode match. If the anode expands 
faster than the cathode, the planar cell tends to curl like a potato 
chip when the temperature changes.
Note that fuel cells do not provide a new source of energy. They 
are designed to use conventional, currently available fuels. Their 
main advantage lies in the efficiency of their operation, which 
creates fewer byproducts to threaten the environment.

he “ordinary chemical reactions” discussed to this point involve changes in the outer 
electronic structures of atoms or molecules. In contrast, nuclear reactions result 
from changes taking place within atomic nuclei. You will recall (Chapter 2) that 
atomic nuclei are represented by symbols such as
12
6C  14
6C
The atomic number Z (number of protons in the nucleus) is shown as a left subscript. The 
mass number A (number of protons 1 number of neutrons in the nucleus) appears as a left 
superscript.
The reactions that we discuss in this chapter will be represented by nuclear equations. 
An equation of this type uses nuclear symbols such as those above; in other respects it re-
sembles an ordinary chemical equation. A nuclear equation must be balanced with respect to 
nuclear charge (atomic number) and nuclear mass (mass number). To see what that means, 
consider an equation that we will have a lot more to say about later in this chapter:

The universe passes along a way of

A process of matter dissolving in the

Turned into radiation, passing through

Again to matter; again, perhaps, to

18.1 Nuclear Stability
As we have learned from Chapter 2, atomic nuclei consist of protons, which are posi-
tively charged, and neutrons, which have zero charge. According to classical electrostat-
ics, we should expect the protons to repel one another and the nucleus to fly apart. It 
turns out, however, that at the very short distances of separation characteristic of atomic 
nuclei (about 10215 m), there are strong attractive forces between nuclear particles. The 
stability of a nucleus depends upon the balance between these forces and electrostatic 
repulsion.
Despite extensive research, we still do not have a clear understanding of the way in 
which those forces lead to nuclear stability. All we have is a series of empirical rules for 
predicting which nuclei will be most stable. The most important of these rules are listed 
below.
•	 The neutron-to-proton ratio (n/p1) required for stability varies with atomic number. 
The 264 known stable nuclei, shown as red dots in Figure 18.1, fall within a relatively 
narrow belt of stability. For light elements (Z , 20), this ratio is close to one. For 
example, the isotopes 12
6C, 14
 7N, and 16
 8O are stable. As atomic number increases, the 
Nuclear reactions usually involve the 
transmutation of elements.
Figure 18.1 Neutron-to-proton 
ratios of stable isotopes. The ratios 
of stable isotopes (red dots) fall within 
a narrow range, referred to as the “belt 
of stability.” For light isotopes of small 
atomic number the stable ratio is 11. 
For heavier isotopes the ratio gradu-
ally increases to about 1.51. Isotopes 
outside the belt of stability are unstable 
and radioactive. There are no stable 
isotopes for elements of atomic num-
ber greater than 83 (Bi).

ratio increases; the belt of stability shifts to higher numbers of neutrons. With very 
heavy isotopes such as 206
82Pb, the stable neutron-to-proton ratio is about 1.5.
(206 2 82)/82 5 1.51
•	 Nuclei containing more than 83 protons are unstable. Putting it another way, no ele-
ment beyond bismuth (Z 5 83) has a stable isotope. All the isotopes of such elements 
are radioactive.
•	 Nuclei with an even number of nucleons, either protons or neutrons, tend to be more 
stable than those with an odd number of nuclear particles.
•	 Certain numbers of protons and neutrons appear to be particularly stable: 2, 8, 20, 28, 
50, 82, and 126. These magic numbers were first suggested by Maria Mayer (1906–
1972), who developed a nuclear shell model similar to, but much less regular than, the 
electron shell model discussed in Chapter 6. For her work, Maria Mayer won the 
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963. The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded yearly 
(except between 1940 and 1942) for 106 years, and the only women to have won this 
prize so far are Maria Mayer and Marie Curie.

18.2 Radioactivity
Unstable isotopes decompose (decay) by a process referred to as radioactivity. A few 
such nuclei occur in nature, accounting for natural radioactivity. Many more can be 
made (“induced”) artificially by bombarding stable nuclei with high-energy particles. 
The radiation given off (Figure 18.2, page 566) may be in the form of
beta (b) particles identical in their properties to electrons
alpha (a) particles, which are 42He nuclei, carrying a 12 charge because the two ex-
tranuclear electrons of the helium atom are missing
gamma (g) rays, which consist of high-energy radiation

566
	
chapter eighteen  Nuclear Reactions
Mode of Decay
Naturally occurring radioactive nuclei commonly decompose by
•	 alpha particle emission, in which an ordinary helium nucleus, 42He, is given off. 
Uranium-238 behaves this way:
238
92U 9: 42He 1 234
90Th
	
Notice that when alpha emission occurs, the atomic number decreases by two units; 
the mass number decreases by four units. Here, as in all nuclear equations, there is a 
balance of both atomic number (90 1 2 5 92) and mass number (234 1 4 5 238) on 
both sides of the arrow.
	
	
The alpha particle is by far the most massive particle emitted by radioactive nu-
clei. It has the highest ionizing power, i.e., the ability to ionize other molecules or ions. 
Because of their size, alpha particles have difficulty penetrating cells. Thus they can be 
stopped by clothing, skin, or even a sheet of paper. Alpha-emitting nuclei kept outside 
the body are relatively safe. Inhaling or ingesting these particles is much more dan-
gerous, because cell membranes cannot stop them.
•	 beta particle emission, which produces an electron, given the symbol 210e. An ex-
ample of beta emission is
234
90Th 9: 210e 1 234
91Pa
	
Notice that the product nucleus, 234
91Pa, has the same mass number as the reactant, 
234
90Th, but its atomic number is one unit larger. Putting it another way, beta emission 
converts a neutron to a proton. It occurs with nuclei that contain “too many neutrons” 
for stability.
	
	
Beta particles are smaller and lighter than alpha particles. Thus although they can 
penetrate the cell more easily, they have a lower ionizing power. A sheet of metal can stop 
their entry into cells, and even when ingested or inhaled, they are less destructive than al-
pha particles.
•	 gamma radiation emission, which consists of high-energy photons. Because gamma 
emission changes neither the mass number nor the atomic number, it is ordinarily 
omitted in writing nuclear equations.
Figure 18.2 Nuclear radiation. In the 
presence of an electric field, alpha par-
ticles are deflected toward the negative 
pole, showing that they are positively 
charged, and beta particles are de-
flected toward the positive pole, show-
ing that they are negatively charged. 
Because they are lighter, beta particles 
are deflected more than alpha particles. 
Gamma rays pass straight through the 
field and so must have no charge.

	 Gamma rays, because of their size, have the lowest ionizing power. However, several 
inches of lead or a thick cement block is necessary to stop gamma ray penetration.
	
	 Radioactive nuclei produced “artificially” in the laboratory can show a-, b-, or 
g-emission. They can also decompose by
•	 positron emission. A positron is identical to an electron except that it has a charge 
of 11 rather than 21. A positron has the symbol 01e.

Here, a proton in K-40 (19 p1, 21 n) is converted to a neutron in Ar-40 (18 p1, 22 n). 
Positron emission is characteristic of nuclei that have too many protons for stability.
•	 K-electron capture, in which an electron in the innermost energy level (n 5 1) “falls” 
into the nucleus.
82
37Rb 1 210e 9: 82
36Kr
	
Notice that the result of K-electron capture is the same as positron emission; mass 
number remains unchanged, whereas atomic number decreases by one unit. Electron 
capture is more common with heavy nuclei, presumably because the n 5 1 level is 
closer to the nucleus.
Promethium is by far the rarest of the  
“rare earths” (Example 18.2).

Bombardment Reactions
More than 1500 radioactive isotopes have been prepared in the laboratory. The num-
ber of such isotopes per element ranges from 1 (hydrogen and boron) to 34 (indium). 
They are all prepared by bombardment reactions in which a stable nucleus is con-
verted to one that is radioactive, which in turn decays to stable products. The bom-
barding particle may be
•	 a neutron, usually of rather low energy, produced in a fission reactor (Section 18.5). A 
typical reaction of this type is

•	 a charged particle (electron, positron, a-particle, . . .), which can be accelerated to 
very high velocities in electric and/or magnetic fields. In this way, the charged particle 
acquires enough energy to bring about a nuclear reaction, despite electrostatic repul-
sion with the components of the atom.
The first radioactive isotopes to be made in the laboratory were prepared in 1934 by 
Irene Curie and her husband, Frederic Joliot. They achieved this by bombarding certain 
stable isotopes with high-energy alpha particles. One reaction was

An interesting application of bombardment reactions is the preparation of the so-
called transuranium elements. Beginning with neptunium (Np, Z 5 93) in 1940, a series 
of elements with atomic numbers greater than that of uranium have been synthesized. 
Much of this work was done by a group at the University of California, Berkeley, under 
the direction of Glenn Seaborg (1912–1999) and later Albert Ghiorso (1915– ). A Russian 
group at Dubna near Moscow, led by G. N. Flerov (1913–1999), made significant contri-
butions. The heavy ele­ments (197 through 212) were prepared in the late twentieth cen-
tury by a German group at Darmstadt under the direction of Peter Armbruster (1931– ). 
Most of the nuclei produced have half-lives of a few microseconds. Experiments report-
ing the formation of elements 113, 115, 116, and 117 have been reported in peer-reviewed 
journals, but their identification is yet to be confirmed by IUPAC (International Union 
of Pure and Applied Chemists).

18.2  radioactivity
In October 2006, a research team of scientists from the Lawrence Livermore Na-
tional Laboratory in California, USA, and the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in 
Dubna, Russia, reported the indirect detection of Uuo-294 (Element 118). It is reported 
to be produced by the following collisions.

98Cf 1 48
20Ca 9: 2194
18Uuo 1 3 10n
The decay products of Uuo-294, not the atoms themselves, were observed. 
Some of the reactions used to prepare transuranium elements are listed in Table 18.1. 
Neutron bombardment is effective for the lower members of the series (elements  
93 through 95), but the yield of product decreases sharply with increasing atomic num-
ber. To form the heavier transuranium elements, it is necessary to bombard appropriate 
targets with high-energy positive ions. By using relatively heavy bombarding particles 
such as carbon-12, one can achieve a considerable increase in atomic number.
Applications
A large number of radioactive nuclei have been used both in industry and in many areas 
of basic and applied research. A few of these are discussed below.
Medicine
Radioactive isotopes are commonly used in cancer therapy, usually to eliminate any ma-
lignant cells left after surgery. Cobalt-60 is most often used; g-rays from this source are 
focused at small areas where cancer is suspected. Certain types of cancer can be treated 
internally with radioactive isotopes. If a patient suffering from cancer of the thyroid 
drinks a solution of NaI containing radioactive iodide ions (131I or 123I), the iodine moves 
preferentially to the thyroid gland. There the radiation destroys malignant cells without 
affecting the rest of the body.
More commonly, radioactive nuclei are used for diagnosis (Table 18.2). Positron 
emission tomography (PET) is a technique used to study brain disorders. The patient is 
given a dose of glucose (C6H12O6) containing a small amount of carbon-11, a positron 
emitter. The brain is then scanned to detect positron emission from the radioactive “la-
beled” glucose. In this way, differences in glucose uptake and metabolism in patients 
with normal and abnormal brains are established. For example, PET scans have deter-
mined that the brain of a schizophrenic metabolizes only about 20% as much glucose as 
that of most people.
Chemistry
Radioactive nuclei are used extensively in chemical analysis. One technique of particular 
importance is neutron activation analysis. This procedure depends on the phenomenon of 
induced radioactivity. A sample is bombarded by neutrons, bringing about such reactions as

chapter eighteen  Nuclear Reactions
Ordinarily the element retains its chemical identity, but the isotope formed is radioac-
tive, decaying by gamma emission. The magnitude of the energy change and hence the 
wavelength of the gamma ray vary from one element to another and so can serve for the 
qualitative analysis of the sample. The intensity of the radiation depends on the amount 
of the element present in the sample; this permits quantitative analysis of the sample. 
Neutron activation analysis can be used to analyze for 50 different elements in amounts 
as small as one picogram (10212 g).
One application of neutron activation analysis is in the field of archaeology. By mea-
suring the amount of strontium in the bones of prehistoric humans, it is possible to get 
some idea of their diet. Plants contain considerably more strontium than animals do, so 
a high strontium content suggests a largely vegetarian diet. Strontium analyses of bones 
taken from ancient farming communities consistently show a difference by sex; women 
have higher strontium levels than men. Apparently, in those days, women did most of 
the farming; men spent a lot of time away from home hunting and eating their kill.
Commercial Applications
Most smoke alarms (Figure 18.3) use a radioactive species, typically americium-241. A tiny 
amount of this isotope is placed in a small ionization chamber; decay of Am-241 ionizes 
air molecules within the chamber. Under the influence of a potential applied by a battery, 
these ions move across the chamber, producing an electric current. If smoke particles get 
into the chamber, the flow of ions is impeded and the current drops. This is detected by 
electronic circuitry, and an alarm sounds. The alarm also goes off if the battery voltage 
drops, indicating that it needs to be replaced.
Another potential application of radioactive species is in food preservation (Figure 
18.4). It is well known that gamma rays can kill insects, larvae, and parasites such as trichina 
that cause trichinosis in pork. Radiation can also inhibit the sprouting of onions and pota-
toes. Perhaps most important from a commercial standpoint, it can extend the shelf lives 
of many foods for weeks or even months. Many chemicals used to preserve foods have later 
been shown to have adverse health effects, so irradiation is an attractive alternative. Finally, 
irradiation can destroy microorganisms such as E. coli (which explains its use in treating 
beef) and anthrax (which explains its use in “sterilizing” suspected mail).

smoke detectors use a tiny amount of

18.3 Rate of Radioactive Decay
As pointed out in Chapter 11, radioactive decay is a fi rst-order process. Th is means that 
the following equations, discussed on pages 340–342, apply:
 
rate 5 kX
 
ln Xo
X  5 kt
 
k 5 0.693
t1/2
where k is the fi rst-order rate constant, t1/2 is the half-life, X is the amount of radioactive 
species present at time t, and Xo is the amount at t 5 0.
Because of the way in which rate of decay is measured (Figure 18.5), it is oft en de-
scribed by the activity (A) of the sample, which expresses the number of atoms decaying 
in unit time. Th e fi rst equation above can be written
 
A 5 kN 
(18.1)
where A is the activity, k the fi rst-order rate constant, and N the number of radioactive 
nuclei present.
The history of radiochemistry is in no small 
measure the story of two remarkable 
women, Marie and Irene Curie, and their 
husbands, Pierre Curie and Frederic Joliot. 
Marie Curie (1867–1934) was born Maria 
sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, then a part 
of the russian empire. In 1891, she emi-
grated to Paris to study at the sorbonne, 
where she met and married a French phys-
icist, Pierre Curie (1859–1906). The Curies 
were associates of Henri Becquerel (1852–
1928), the man who discovered that 
uranium salts are radioactive. They showed 
that thorium, like uranium, is radioactive 
and that the amount of radiation emitted is 
directly proportional to the amount of 
uranium or thorium in the sample.
In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie isolated 
two new radioactive elements, which they 
named radium and polonium. To obtain a 
few milligrams of these elements, they 
started with several tons of pitchblende 
ore and carried out a long series of tedious 
separations. Their work was done in a 
poorly equipped, unheated shed where the 
temperature reached 68C (438F) in winter. 
Four years later, in 1902, Marie determined 
the atomic mass of radium to within 0.5%, 
working with a tiny sample.
In 1903, the Curies received the Nobel 
Prize in Physics (with Becquerel) for the dis-
covery of radioactivity. Three years later, 
Pierre Curie died at the age of 46, the victim 
of a tragic accident. He stepped from behind 
a carriage in a busy Paris street and was run 
down by a horse-driven truck. That same 
year, Marie became the fi rst woman instruc-
tor at the sorbonne. In 1911, she won the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery 
of radium and polonium, thereby becoming 
the fi rst person to win two Nobel Prizes.
When europe exploded into war in 
1914, scientists largely abandoned their 
studies to go to the front. Marie Curie, with 
her daughter Irene, then 17 years old, orga-
nized medical units equipped with x-ray 
machinery. These were used to locate 
foreign metallic objects in wounded sol-
diers. Many of the wounds were to the 
head; French soldiers came out of the 
trenches without head protection because 
their government had decided that helmets 
looked too german. In November of 1918, 
the Curies celebrated the end of World 
War I; France was victorious, and Marie’s 
beloved Poland was free again.
In 1921, Irene Curie (1897–1956) began 
research at the radium Institute. Five years 
later she married Frederic Joliot (1900–
1958), a brilliant young physicist who was 
also an assistant at the Institute. In 1931, 
they began a research program in nuclear 
chemistry that led to several important dis-
coveries and at least one near miss. The 
Joliot-Curies were the fi rst to demonstrate 
induced radioactivity. They also discovered 
the positron, a particle that scientists had 
been seeking for many years. They narrowly 
missed fi nding another, more fundamental 
particle, the neutron. That honor went to 
James Chadwick in england. In 1935, Irene 
Curie and Frederic Joliot received the Nobel 
Prize in Physics. The award came too late 
for Irene’s mother, who had died of leuke-
mia in 1934. Twenty-two years later, Irene 
Curie-Joliot died of the same disease. Both 
women acquired leukemia through pro-
longed exposure to radiation.

Age of Organic Material
During the 1950s, Professor W. F. Libby (1908–1980) of the University of Chicago and 
others worked out a method for determining the age of organic material. It is based on 
the decay rate of carbon-14. The method can be applied to objects from a few hundred 
up to 50,000 years old. It has been used to determine the authenticity of canvases of 
Renaissance painters and to check the ages of relics left by prehistoric cave dwellers.
Carbon-14 is produced in the atmosphere by the interaction of neutrons from cos-
mic radiation with ordinary nitrogen atoms:
147N 1 10n 9: 146C 1 11H
The carbon-14 formed by this nuclear reaction is eventually incorporated into the car-
bon dioxide of the air. A steady-state concentration, amounting to about one atom of 
carbon-14 for every 1012 atoms of carbon-12, is established in atmospheric CO2. More 
specifically, the concentration of C-14 is such that a sample containing one gram of

carbon has an activity of 15.3 atoms/min. A living plant, taking in carbon dioxide, has 
this same activity, as do plant-eating animals or human beings.
When a plant or animal dies, the intake of radioactive carbon stops. Consequently,

takes over, and the C-14 activity drops. The activity of a sample is directly proportional 
to the amount of C-14, so we can write:

As you can imagine, it is not easy to determine accurately activities of the order of  
10 atoms decaying per minute, about one “event” every six seconds. Elaborate precau-
tions have to be taken to exclude background radiation. Moreover, relatively large sam-
ples must be used to increase the counting rate. Recently a technique has been developed 
whereby C-14 atoms can be counted very accurately in a specially designed mass spec-
trometer. This method was used to date the Shroud of Turin, using six samples with a 
total mass of about 0.1 g. Analysis by an international team of scientists in 1988 showed 
that the flax used to make the linen of which the Shroud is composed grew in the

The energy change accompanying a nuclear reaction can be calculated from the 
relation

DE 5 energy products 2 energy reactants
	
c 5 speed of light
In a spontaneous nuclear reaction, the products weigh less than the reactants (Dm nega-
tive). In this case, the energy of the products is less than that of the reactants (DE nega-
tive) and energy is evolved to the surroundings.
In an “ordinary chemical reaction,” Dm is immeasurably small. In a nuclear reac-
tion, on the other hand, Dm is appreciable, amounting to 0.002% or more of the mass of 
reactants. The change in mass can readily be calculated from a table of nuclear masses 
(Table 18.3, page 576).
To obtain a more useful form of the equation DE 5 c2 Dm, we substitute for c its 
value in meters per second.

This equation can be used to calculate the energy change in joules, if you know Dm in 
kilograms. Ordinarily, Dm is expressed in grams; DE is calculated in kilojoules. The rela-
tionship between DE and Dm in these units can be found by using conversion factors:

Nuclear Binding Energy
It is always true that a nucleus weighs less than the individual protons and neutrons of 
which it is composed. Consider, for example, the 63Li nucleus, which contains three pro-
tons and three neutrons. According to Table 18.3, one mole of Li-6 nuclei weighs 
6.01348 g. In contrast, the total mass of three moles of neutrons and three moles of  
protons is

The binding energy of a nucleus is, in a sense, a measure of its stability. The greater 
the binding energy, the more difficult it would be to decompose the nucleus into protons 
and neutrons. As you might expect, the binding energy as calculated above increases 
steadily as the nucleus gets heavier, containing more protons and neutrons. A better 
measure of the relative stabilities of different nuclei is the binding energy per mole of 
nuclear particles (nucleons). This quantity is calculated by dividing the binding energy 
per mole of nuclei by the number of particles per nucleus. Thus

Figure 18.6 (page 579) shows a plot of this quantity, binding energy/mole of nucle-
ons, versus mass number. Notice that the curve has a broad maximum in the vicinity 
of mass numbers 50 to 80. Consider what would happen if a heavy nucleus such as 
235
92U were to split into smaller nuclei with mass numbers near the maximum. This 
process, referred to as nuclear fission, should result in an evolution of energy. The 
same result is obtained if very light nuclei such as 21H combine with one another to 
form a heavier nucleus. Indeed, this process, called nuclear fusion, should evolve 
even more energy, because the binding energy per nucleon increases very sharply at 
the beginning of the curve.
Both very heavy and very light nuclei 
are relatively unstable; they decom-
pose with the evolution of energy.

18.5 Nuclear Fission
The process of nuclear fission was discovered in Germany more than half a century ago 
in 1938 by Lise Meitner (1878–1968) and Otto Hahn (1879–1968). With the outbreak of 
World War II a year later, interest focused on the enormous amount of energy released 
in the process. At Los Alamos, in the mountains of New Mexico, a group of scientists led 
by J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967) worked feverishly to produce the fission, or 
“atomic,” bomb. Many of the members of this group were exiles from Nazi Germany. 
They were spurred on by the fear that Hitler would obtain the bomb first. 
Their work led to the explosion of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico 
desert at 5:30 a.m. on July 16, 1945. Less than a month later (August 6, 1945), 
the world learned of this new weapon when another bomb was exploded 
over Hiroshima. This bomb killed 70,000 people and completely devastated 
an area of 10 square kilometers. Three days later, Nagasaki and its inhabit-
ants met a similar fate. On August 14, Japan surrendered, and World War II 
was over.
The Fission Process (23952U)
Several isotopes of the heavy elements undergo fission if bombarded by 
neutrons of high enough energy. In practice, attention has centered on two 
particular isotopes, 235
92U and 239
94Pu. Both of these can be split into fragments 
by relatively low-energy neutrons.
Our discussion concentrates on the uranium-235 isotope. It makes up 
only about 0.7% of naturally occurring uranium. The more abundant iso-
tope, uranium-238, does not undergo fission. The first process used to sepa-
rate these isotopes, and until recently the only one available, was that of 
gaseous effusion (Chapter 5). The volatile compound uranium hexafluoride, 
UF6, which sublimes at 568C, is used for this purpose.
When a uranium-235 atom undergoes fission, it splits into two unequal 
fragments and a number of neutrons and beta particles. The fission process 
is complicated by the fact that different uranium-235 atoms split up in many 
Mass number of nucleus

has its maximum value for nuclei of intermediate mass, falling off for very heavy or very light 
nuclei. The form of this curve accounts for the fact that both fission and fusion give off large 
amounts of energy.

different ways. For example, while one atom of 235
92U is splitting to give isotopes of ru-
bidium (Z 5 37) and cesium (Z 5 55), another may break up to give isotopes of bromine 
(Z 5 35) and lanthanum (Z 5 57), while still another atom yields isotopes of zinc 
(Z 5 30) and samarium (Z 5 62):

More than 200 isotopes of 35 different elements have been identified among the fission 
products of uranium-235.
The stable neutron-to-proton ratio near the middle of the periodic table, where the 
fission products are located, is considerably smaller (1.2) than that of uranium-235 
(1.6). Hence the immediate products of the fission process contain too many neutrons 
for stability; they decompose by beta emission. In the case of rubidium-90, three steps 
are required to reach a stable nucleus:

The radiation hazard associated with fallout from nuclear weapons testing arises 
from radioactive isotopes such as these. One of the most dangerous is strontium-90. In 
the form of strontium carbonate, SrCO3, it is incorporated into the bones of animals and 
human beings, where it remains for a lifetime.
Notice from the fission equations above that two to four neutrons are produced by 
fission for every one consumed. Once a few atoms of uranium-235 split, the neutrons 
produced can bring about the fission of many more uranium-235 atoms. This creates the 
possibility of a chain reaction, whose rate increases exponentially with time. This is pre-
cisely what happens in the atomic bomb. The energy evolved in successive fissions esca-
lates to give a tremendous explosion within a few seconds.
For nuclear fission to result in a chain reaction, the sample must be large enough so 
that most of the neutrons are captured internally. If the sample is too small, most of the 
neutrons escape, breaking the chain. The critical mass of uranium-235 required to main-
tain a chain reaction in a bomb appears to be about 1 to 10 kg. In the bomb dropped on 
Hiroshima, the critical mass was achieved by using a conventional explosive to fire one 
piece of uranium-235 into another.
The evolution of energy in nuclear fission is directly related to the decrease in mass 
that takes place. About 80,000,000 kJ of energy is given off for every gram of 235
92U that 
reacts. This is about 40 times as great as the energy change for simple nuclear reactions 
such as radioactive decay. The heat of combustion of coal is only about 30 kJ/g; the en-
ergy given off when TNT explodes is still smaller, about 2.8 kJ/g. Putting it another way, 
the fission of one gram of 235
92U produces as much energy as the combustion of 2700 kg of 
coal or the explosion of 30 metric tons (3 3 104 kg) of TNT.
Nuclear Reactors
About 20% of the electricity generated in the United States come from nuclear reac-
tors, which use the fission of U-235 to generate heat. That heat boils water and turns 
a turbine. A light-water reactor is shown schematically in Figure 18.7 (page 581). The 
fuel rods contain cylindrical pellets of uranium dioxide (UO2) in zirconium alloy 
tubes. The uranium in these reactors is “enriched” so that it contains about 3% 
U-235, the fissionable isotope. Natural uranium is less than 1% U-235. The control 
rods are cylinders that contain substances such as boron and cadmium, which ab-
sorb neutrons. By varying the depth to which these are inserted into the reactor 
core, the speed of the chain reactions can be controlled. In a pressurized water reac-
tor, water at 140 atm absorbs the heat released by the chain reaction and is heated to 
about 3208C. This heated water passes through the steam generators, which also

to 20,000 tons of TNT.

contain water under pressure. The water turns to steam at 2708C and drives a turbo-
generator that produces electricity.
In a light water reactor, the circulating water in the core serves a purpose beyond 
cooling. It slows down, or moderates, the neutrons produced in the fission reactions. 
This is necessary if the chain reaction is to continue. Fast neutrons, unmoderated, are 
not readily absorbed by the U-235 nuclei. Reactors designed in Canada use heavy wa-
ter, D2O, which has had an important advantage over ordinary water. Its moderating 
properties are such that naturally occurring uranium can be used as a fuel. Energy-
intensive enrichment has not been necessary. The next generation of Canadian reac-
tors, called Advanced CANDU, include the use of lightly enriched uranium, just as 
light water reactors do.
By the 1970s it was generally supposed that nuclear fission would replace fossil fuels 
(oil, natural gas, coal) as an energy source. That hasn’t happened. The most evident rea-
sons are
•	 Nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, in 1979 and Chernobyl, 
Ukraine, in 1986 had a devastating effect on public opinion in the United States and, 
to a smaller degree, elsewhere in the world. At Three Mile Island only about  
50 curies of radiation were released to the environment and there were no casual-
ties. The explosion at Chernobyl was a very different story. About 100 million curies 
were released, leading to at least 31 fatalities. Moreover, 135,000 people were perma-
nently evacuated from the region surrounding the reactor. Since then, all the other 
reactors at Chernobyl—three, in addition to the one that exploded—have been per-
manently shut down.
•	 Disposal of radioactive wastes from nuclear reactors has proved to be a serious 
political issue. The NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude applies here. The U.S. 
government has spent billions of dollars to develop a permanent nuclear waste 
storage repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as the site for burying some 
70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste. Current plans (mostly as a result of political 
pressure), however, include closing the Yucca Mountain repository permanently, 
precluding waste storage there. The problem of radioactive waste disposal is not 
a uniquely American problem. Other nations have struggled with the disposal of 
wastes as well.
Currently, nuclear energy is being reevaluated in light of its carbon neutrality. 
That is, nuclear reactors do not directly contribute the gases, believed by many sci-

entists to contribute to global warming, that the combustion of carbon-based fuels 
do. Furthermore, reactor designs now under construction or on the drawing boards 
(called Generation III+ reactors) are addressing some of the safety and cost issues 
that have plagued past designs. Generation III1 reactors are now under construc-
tion in China, Finland, Korea, and Japan, and one U.S. utility has made a firm com-
mitment to construct one such reactor (the Westinghouse AP1000), adding two ad-
ditional units to a pair of currently operating reactors in the state of Georgia. These 
will be the first new reactors constructed since the 1970s. Older designs are also be-
ing revived. The last reactor to go online in the United States, at Watts Bar in Ten-
nessee, opened in 1996. Construction of what was to be a two-unit plant began in 
1973. The second unit was never completed. Now, the Tennessee Valley Authority is 
actively working to restart construction on the unfinished reactor, expecting to have 
it online in 2013.
18.6 Nuclear Fusion
Recall (Figure 18.6, page 579) that very light nuclei, such as those of hydrogen, are un-
stable with respect to fusion into heavier isotopes. Indeed, the energy available from 
nuclear fusion is considerably greater than that given off in the fission of an equal mass 
of a heavy element (Example 18.7).

583
	
18.6  nuclear fusion
As an energy source, nuclear fusion possesses several additional advantages over 
nuclear fission. In particular, light isotopes suitable for fusion are far more abundant 
than the heavy isotopes required for fission. You can calculate, for example (Problem 
79), that the fusion of only 2 3 1029 % of the deuterium (21H) in seawater would meet the 
total annual energy requirements of the world.
Unfortunately, fusion processes, unlike neutron-induced fission, have very high 
activation energies. To overcome the electrostatic repulsion between two deuterium 
nuclei and cause them to react, they have to be accelerated to velocities of about  
106 m/s, about 10,000 times greater than ordinary molecular velocities at room tem-
perature. The corresponding temperature for fusion, as calculated from kinetic theo-
ry, is of the order of 109 8C. In the hydrogen bomb, temperatures of this magnitude 
were achieved by using a fission reaction to trigger nuclear fusion. If fusion reactions 
are to be used to generate electricity, it will be necessary to develop equipment in 
which very high temperatures can be maintained long enough to allow fusion to oc-
cur and give off energy. In any conventional container, the reactant nuclei would 
quickly lose their high kinetic energies by collisions with the walls.
One fusion reaction currently under study is a two-step process involving deuterium 
and lithium as the basic starting materials:
21H 1 31H 9: 42He 1 10n
63Li 1 10n 9: 42He 1 31H
21H 1 63Li 9: 2 42He
This process is attractive because it has a lower activation energy 
than other fusion reactions.
One possible way to achieve nuclear fusion is to use magnetic 
fields to confine the reactant nuclei and prevent them from touch-
ing the walls of the container, where they would quickly slow down 
below the velocity required for fusion. Using 400-ton magnets, it is 
possible to sustain the reaction for a fraction of a second. To achieve 
a net evolution of energy, this time must be extended to about one 
second. A practical fusion reactor would have to produce 20 times 
as much energy as it consumes. Optimists predict that this goal may 
be reached in 50 years.
Another approach to nuclear fusion is shown in Figure 18.8. 
Tiny glass pellets (about 0.1 mm in diameter) filled with frozen deu-
terium and tritium serve as a target. The pellets are illuminated by a 
powerful laser beam, which delivers 1012 kilowatts of power in one 
nanosecond (1029 s). The reaction is the same as with magnetic con-
finement; unfortunately, at this point energy breakeven seems many 
years away.
end point
Comparing the answers to (a) and (b), it appears that the fusion reaction produces about seven times as much energy per 
gram of reactant (57.2 3 107 versus 8.19 3 107 kJ) as does the fission reaction. This factor varies from about 3 to 10, depend-
ing on the particular reaction chosen to represent the fission and fusion processes.

Biological Eﬀ ects of Radiation
The harmful eff ects of radiation result from its high energy, suﬃ  -
cient to form unstable free radicals (species containing unpaired 
electrons) such as
H9O
H
O9O
These free radicals can react with and in that sense destroy organic 
molecules essential to life.
The extent of damage from radiation depends mainly on two 
factors. These are the amount of radiation absorbed and the type 
of radiation. The former is commonly expressed in rads (radiation 
absorbed dose). A rad corresponds to the absorption of 1022 J of 
energy per kilogram of tissue:
1 rad 5 1022 J/kg
The biological eff ect of radiation is expressed in rems (radiation 
equivalent for man). The number of rems is found by multiplying 
the number of rads by a “damage” factor, n:
no. of rems 5 n (no. of rads)
where n is 1 for gamma and beta radiation, 5 for low-energy neu-
trons, and 10 to 20 for high-energy neutrons and alpha particles. 
Table A lists some of the eff ects to be expected when a person is 
exposed to a single dose of radiation at various levels.
The average exposure to radiation of people living in the united 
states is about 360 mrem (0.36 rem) per year. Notice (Figure A) 
that 82% of the radiation comes from natural sources; the greatest 
single source by far is radon (55%). The level of exposure to radon 
depends on location. In 1985 a man named stanley Watras, who 
happened to work at a nuclear power plant, found that he was 
setting off  the radiation monitors when he went to work in the 
CHeMIsTrY beYOnD the claSSrOOM
morning. It turned out that the house he lived in had a radon level 
2000 times the national average.
222rn, a radioactive isotope of radon, is a decay product of nat-
urally occurring uranium-238. Because it is gaseous and chemi-
cally inert, radon seeps through cracks in concrete and masonry 
from the ground into houses. There its concentration builds up, 
particularly if the house is tightly insulated. Inhalation of radon-222 
can cause health problems because its decay products, including 
Po-218 and Po-214, are intensely radioactive and readily absorbed 
in lung tissue. The environmental Protection Agency (ePA) esti-
mates that radon inhalation causes between 5000 and 20,000 of 
the 130,000 deaths from lung cancer annually in the united 
states. The ePA recommends that special ventilation devices be 
used to remove radon from basements if tests show (Figure B) 
that the radiation level exceeds 4 3 10212 Ci/l.

n previous chapters we have referred from time to time to compounds of the transition 
metals. Many of these have relatively simple formulas such as CuSO4 , CrCl3 , and Fe(NO3)3. 
These compounds are ionic. The transition metal is present as a simple cation (Cu21, Cr31, 
Fe31). In that sense, they resemble the ionic compounds formed by the main-group metals, 
such as CaSO4 and Al(NO3)3.
It has been known for more than a century, however, that transition metals also form a 
variety of ionic compounds with more complex formulas such as
[Cu(NH3)4]SO4  [Cr(NH3)6]Cl3  K3[Fe(CN)6]
In these so-called coordination compounds, the transition metal is present as a complex ion, 
enclosed within the brackets. In the three compounds listed above, the following complex 
ions are present:
Cu(NH3)421    Cr(NH3)631    Fe(CN)632
The charges of these complex ions are balanced by those of simple anions or cations (e.g., 
SO422, 3Cl2, 3K1).
Chromium ions are sensitive to their 
Chemical environment. 
They make the ruby red. 
The emerald green. 
The ruby and emerald are similar.

When a tetrahedron is reflected or 
rotated, a structure indistinguishable 
from the original is obtained. 
Chemists call the tetrahedron a 
symmetric structure. Escher, in his

19.1  composition of complex ions
This chapter is devoted to complex ions and the important role they play in inorganic 
chemistry. We consider in turn
• the composition and names of complex ions and the coordination compounds that 
they form (Sections 19.1 and 19.2).
• the geometry of complex ions (Section 19.3).
• the electronic structure of the central metal ion (or atom) in a complex (Section 19.4).
19.1 Composition of Complex Ions
When ammonia is added to an aqueous solution of a copper(II) salt, a deep, almost 
opaque, blue color develops (Figure 19.1). This color is due to the formation of the 
Cu(NH3)421 ion, in which four NH3 molecules are bonded to a central Cu21 ion. The 
formation of this species can be represented by the equation

The nitrogen atom of each NH3 molecule contributes a pair of unshared electrons to 
form a covalent bond with the Cu21 ion. This bond and others like it, where both elec-
trons are contributed by the same atom, are referred to as coordinate covalent bonds.
The Cu(NH3)421 ion is commonly referred to as a complex ion. We use the term 
complex ion to indicate a charged species in which a metal atom is bonded to neutral 
molecules and/or anions referred to collectively as ligands. The number of bonds formed 
by the central atom is called its coordination number. In the Cu(NH3)421 complex ion
•	 the central atom is Cu21.
•	 the ligands are NH3 molecules.
•	 the coordination number is 4.
Species such as Al(H2O)631 and Zn(H2O)3(OH)1, found in previous chapters, are 
further examples of complex ions. The metals that show the greatest tendency to form 
complex ions are those that form small cations with a charge of 12 or greater. Typically, 
these are the metals toward the right of the transition series (in the first transition series, 
24Cr through 30Zn). Nontransition metals, including Al, Sn, and Pb, form a more limited 
number of stable complex ions.
When ammonia is added 
to 0.2 M Cu2+, the 
[Cu(NH3)4]2+ complex ion 
forms. The ammonia-
containing ion is an intense 
deep blue, almost violet.
The hydrated 
copper complex 
ion [Cu(H2O)4]2+ 
is light blue.

chapter nineteen  Complex Ions
Cations of these metals invariably exist in aqueous solution as complex ions. Con-
sider, for example, the zinc(II) cation. In a water solution of Zn(NO3)2, the Zn(H2O)421 
ion is present. Treatment with ammonia converts this to Zn(NH3)421; addition of sodi-
um hydroxide forms Zn(OH)422.
An ion such as Cu(NH3)421 cannot exist by itself in the solid state. The 12 charge of 
this ion must be balanced by anions with a total charge of 22. A typical compound con-
taining the Cu(NH3)421 ion is
[Cu(NH3)421]Cl2:    1 Cu(NH3)421 ion, 2 Cl2 ions
Compounds such as the one above, which contain a complex ion, are referred to as co-
ordination compounds. The formula of the complex ion is set off by brackets, [   ], to 
make the structure of the compound clear.
Charges of Complexes
The charge of a complex is readily determined by applying a simple principle:
charge of complex 5 oxid. no. central metal 1 charges of ligands
The application of this principle is shown in Table 19.1, where we list the formulas of 
several complexes formed by platinum(II), which shows a coordination number of 4. 
Notice that one of the species, Pt(NH3)2Cl2, is a neutral complex rather than a complex 
ion; the charges of the two Cl2 ions just cancel that of the central Pt21 ion.

19.1  composition of complex ions
Ligands; Chelating Agents
In principle, any molecule or anion with an unshared pair of electrons can act as a Lewis 
base (see Chapter 13). In other words, it can donate a lone pair to a metal cation to form 
a coordinate covalent bond. In practice, a ligand usually contains an atom of one of the 
more electronegative elements (C, N, O, S, F, Cl, Br, I). Several hundred different ligands 
are known. Those most commonly encountered in general chemistry are NH3 and H2O 
molecules and CN2, Cl2, and OH2 ions.

Some ligands have more than one atom with an unshared pair of electrons and 
hence can form more than one bond with a central metal atom. Ligands of this type are 
referred to as chelating agents; the complexes formed are referred to as chelates (from the 
Greek chela, crab’s claw). Two of the most common chelating agents are the oxalate anion 
(abbreviated ox) and the ethylenediamine molecule (abbreviated en), whose Lewis 
structures are

chapter nineteen  Complex Ions
Figure 19.2 shows the structure of the chelates formed by copper(II) with these li-
gands. Notice that in both of these complex ions, the coordination number of copper(II) 
is 4. The central cation is bonded to four atoms, two from each ligand.
For a ligand to act as a chelating agent, it must have at least two lone pairs of elec-
trons. Moreover, these electron pairs must be far enough removed from one another to 
give a chelate ring with a stable geometry. In the chelates shown in Figure 19.2, the ring 
is five-membered, containing a Cu21 ion and four nonmetal atoms. Most chelates con-
tain five- or six-membered rings. Smaller or larger rings are less stable. For example, 
even though the hydrazine molecule
H
H
H9N9N9H
has two lone pairs, it does not form chelates. To do so, it would have to form a three-
membered ring with 608 bond angles.
Coordination Number
As shown in Table 19.2, the most common coordination number is 6. A coordination 
number of 4 is less common. A value of 2 is restricted largely to Cu1, Ag1, and Au1.
A few cations show only one coordination number in their complexes. Thus Co31 
always shows a coordination number of 6, as in
Co(NH3)631        Co(NH3)4Cl21        Co(en)331
Other cations, such as Al31 and Ni21, have variable coordination numbers, depending 
on the nature of the ligand.

19.2  naming complex ions and coordination compounds
19.2 Naming Complex Ions and Coordination 
Compounds
The nomenclature of compounds containing complex ions is more involved than that of 
the simple inorganic compounds considered in earlier chapters. We will see first how com-
plex ions are named and then look at the nomenclature of coordination compounds.
Complex Cations and Neutral Complexes
To name a species like Cu(NH3)421 or Zn(H2O)2(OH)2, we need to specify
•	 the number and identity of each ligand (4 NH3 molecules; 2 H2O molecules, 2 OH2 ions).
•	 the oxidation number of the central metal atom: copper(II), zinc(II).
To accomplish this, we follow a set of rules.
 1. The names of anions that act as ligands are obtained by substituting -o for the 
normal ending. Examples include
	
Cl2	
chloro	
SO422	
sulfato
	
OH2	
hydroxo	
NO32	
nitrato
	
CN2	
cyano	
CO322	
carbonato
example 19.2
Write formulas (including charges) of all complex ions formed by cobalt(III) with the hydroxide ion and/or ethylenedi-
amine (en) molecules as ligands.
strategy
1. See Table 19.2 for the coordination number(s) of Co31.
2. Recall that coordination number refers to the number of bonds made with the central (metal) atom.
3. Mix en molecules and OH2 ions as ligands to arrive at the maximum number of bonds specified by the coordination 
number.
4. Determine the charge of the complex ion by the relation
    charge 5 oxid no. 1 charge of ligands

Co(OH)6: charge 5 3 1 6(21) 5 23   !:   Co(OH)632
end point
Notice that moving from left to right, one en replaces two OH2 ions. This makes sense: an en molecule has two lone pairs 
that can bond to the metal; OH2 has only one.

chapter nineteen  Complex Ions
  Ordinarily, the names of molecules are not changed when they become ligands (e.g., 
ethylenediamine). There are three important exceptions:
	
H2O	
aqua	
NH3	
ammine	
CO	
carbonyl
	 2. The number of ligands of a particular type is ordinarily indicated by the Greek 
prefixes di, tri, tetra, penta, hexa. Thus we have
	
Cu(H2O)421	
tetraaquacopper(II)
	
Cr(NH3)631	
hexaamminechromium(III)
  If the name of the ligand is itself complex (e.g. ethylenediamine), the number of 
such ligands is indicated by the prefixes bis, tris, tetrakis, pentakis, hexakis. The name 
of the ligand is enclosed in parentheses.
	
Cr(en)331	
tris(ethylenediamine)chromium(III)
 3. When several types of ligand are present, they are named in alphabetical order 
(without regard to prefixes):
	
Cu(NH3)2(H2O)221	
diamminediaquacopper(II)    ammine comes before aqua
	
Cr(NH3)5Cl21	
pentaamminechlororchromium(III)    ammine comes 
before chloro
	 4. As you can deduce from the preceding examples, the oxidation number of the central 
metal ion is indicated by a Roman numeral written at the end of the metal’s name.
Complex Anions
If the complex ion is an anion, such as Zn(OH)422, this is indicated by inserting the suf-
fix ate after the name of the metal.
	
Zn(OH)422	
tetrahydroxozincate(II)
In a few cases, the Latin name of the metal is used in anionic complexes.
	
Fe(CN)632	
hexacyanoferrate(III)
	
Cu(Cl)422	
tetrachlorocuprate(II)
Coordination Compounds
Coordination compounds, like simple ionic compounds, are named in a straightforward 
way. The cation is named first, followed by the anion.
	
[Cu(NH3)4]Cl2	
tetraamminecopper(II) chloride
	
[Fe(en)3]PO4	
tris(ethylenediamine)iron(III) phosphate
	
K3[Fe(CN)6]

The common name of K3[Fe(CN)6] is potassium ferricyanide.

19.3  geometry of complex ions
19.3 Geometry of Complex Ions
The physical and chemical properties of complex ions and of the coordination com-
pounds they form depend on the spatial orientation of ligands around the central metal 
atom. Here we consider the geometries associated with the coordination numbers 2, 4, 
and 6. With that background, we then examine the phenomenon of geometric isomer-
ism, in which two or more complex ions have the same chemical formula but different 
properties because of their different geometries.
Coordination Number 5 2
Complex ions in which the central metal forms only two bonds to ligands are linear; that 
is, the two bonds are directed at a 1808 angle. The structures of CuCl22, Ag(NH3)21, and 
Au(CN)22 may be represented as

Four-coordinate metal complexes may have either of two different geometries (Figure 
19.3, page 598). The four bonds from the central metal may be directed toward the cor-
ners of a regular tetrahedron. This is what we would expect from the VSEPR model (re-
call Chapter 7). Two common tetrahedral complexes are Zn(NH3)421 and CoCl422.
Square planar complexes, in which the four bonds are directed toward the corners 
of a square, are more common. Certain complexes of copper(II) and nickel(II) show this 
geometry; it is characteristic of the complexes of Pd21 and Pt21, including Pt(NH3)421.

We saw in Chapter 7 that octahedral geometry is characteristic of many molecules (e.g., 
SF6) in which a central atom is surrounded by six other atoms. (Remember, an octahe-
dron has eight sides, which is irrelevant here; it has six corners, which is important.) All 
complex ions in which the coordination number is 6 are octahedral. The metal ion (or 
atom) is at the center of the octahedron; the six ligands are at the corners. This geometry 
is shown in Figure 19.4.
It is important to realize that
•	 the six ligands can be considered equidistant from the central metal.
•	 an octahedral complex can be regarded as a derivative of a square planar complex. 
The two extra ligands are located above and below the square, on a line perpendicular 
to the square at its center.
Geometric Isomerism
Two or more species with different physical and chemical properties but the same for-
mula are said to be isomers of one another. Complex ions can show many different kinds 
of isomerism, only one of which we will consider. Geometric isomers are ones that differ 
only in the spatial orientation of ligands around the central metal atom. Geometric 
isomerism is found in square planar and octahedral complexes. It cannot occur in tetra-
hedral complexes where all four positions are equivalent.

The complex in which the two chloride ions are at adjacent corners of the square, as close 
to one another as possible, is called the cis isomer. It is made by reacting ammonia with 
the PtCl422 ion. In the trans isomer, made by reacting Pt(NH3)421 with HCl, the two 
chloride ions are at opposite corners of the square, as far apart as possible.
Geometric isomerism can occur with any square complex of the type Mabcd, Ma2bc, 
or Ma2b2, where M refers to the central metal and a, b, c, and d are different ligands. 
Conversely, geometric isomerism cannot occur with a square complex of the type Ma4 or 
Ma3b. Thus there are two different square complexes with the formula Pt(NH3)2ClBr but 
only one with the formula Pt(NH3)3Cl1.

2.  Octahedral. To understand how geometric isomerism can arise in octahedral 
complexes, refer back to Figure 19.4 (page 598). Notice that for any given position of 
a ligand, four other positions are at the same distance from that ligand, and a fifth is at 
a greater distance.
Taking position 1 in Figure 19.4 as a point of reference, you can see that groups at 2, 
3, 4, and 5 are equidistant from 1; 6 is farther away. In other words, positions 1 and 2, 1 
and 3, 1 and 4, 1 and 5 are cis to one another; positions 1 and 6 are trans. Hence a complex 
ion like Co(NH3)4Cl21 (Figure 19.5) can exist in two different isomeric forms. In the cis 
isomer, the two Cl2 ions are at adjacent corners of the octahedron, as close together as 
possible. In the trans isomer they are at opposite corners, as far away from one another 
as possible.
cis 5 close together; trans 5 far apart.
*The cis isomer (“cisplatin”) is an effective anticancer drug. This reflects the ability of the two Cl atoms to in-
teract with the nitrogen atoms of DNA, a molecule responsible for cell reproduction. The trans isomer is inef-
fective in chemotherapy, presumably because the Cl atoms are too far apart to react with a DNA molecule.

Geometric isomerism can also occur in chelated octahedral complexes (Figure 
19.6). Notice that an ethylenediamine molecule, here and indeed in all complexes, can 
only bridge cis positions. It is not long enough to connect to trans positions.
19.4 Electronic Structure of Complex Ions
Until about 20 years ago, the valence bond model discussed in Chapter 7 was widely used 
to explain electronic structure and bonding in complex ions. It assumed that lone pairs 
of electrons were contributed by ligands to form covalent bonds with metal atoms. This 
model had two major deficiencies. It could not easily explain the magnetic properties of 
complex ions. More important, it offered no explanation of the most striking character-
istic of coordination compounds: their color (Figure 19.7, page 602).
We will discuss the crystal field model here. It assumes that the bonding between 
metal ions and ligands is essentially ionic. More specifically, it considers the effect of ap-
proaching ligands upon the energies of electronic levels in transition metal cations. We 
will apply this model to octahedral complexes. Before doing so, it may be helpful to re-
view the electronic structure of uncomplexed transition metal cations, originally cov-
ered in Chapter 6.

Chapter nineteen  Complex Ions
Transition Metal Cations
Recall (pages 177–178) that in a simple transition metal cation
• there are no outer s electrons. Electrons beyond the preceding noble gas are located 
in an inner d sublevel (3d for the fi rst transition series).
• electrons are distributed among the fi ve d orbitals in accordance with Hund’s rule, 
giving the maximum number of unpaired electrons.
To illustrate these rules, consider the Fe21 ion. Because the atomic number of iron 
is 26, this 12 ion must contain 26 2 2 5 24e2. Of these electrons, the fi rst 18 have the 
argon structure; the remaining six are located in the 3d sublevel. Th e abbreviated elec-
tron confi guration is
Fe21    [Ar]3d6
Th ese six electrons are spread over all fi ve orbitals; the orbital diagram is
 
3d
Fe21  [Ar]  (qp)( q )( q )( q )( q )
Th e Fe21 ion is paramagnetic, with four unpaired electrons.

compounds are brilliantly colored, a

In transition metal cations, 3d is lower 
in energy than 4s.
The basic ideas concerning the structure 
and geometry of complex ions presented 
in this chapter were developed by one of 
the most gifted individuals in the history of 
inorganic chemistry, Alfred Werner. His 
theory of coordination chemistry was pub-
lished in 1893 when Werner was 26 years 
old. In his paper Werner made the revolu-
tionary suggestion that metal ions such as 
Co31 could show two diff erent kinds of va-
lences. For the compound Co(NH3)6Cl3, 
Werner postulated a central Co31 ion 
joined by “primary valences” (ionic bonds) 
to three Cl2 ions and by “secondary va-
lences” (coordinate covalent bonds) to six 
NH3 molecules. Moreover, he made the in-
spired guess that the six secondary va-
lences were directed toward the corners 
of a regular octahedron.
Werner spent the next 20 years obtaining 
experimental evidence to prove his theory. (At 
the University of Zürich, there remain several 
thousand samples of coordination com-
pounds prepared by Werner and his stu-
dents.) He was able to show, for example, that 
the electrical conductivities in water solution 
decreased in the order [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 
[Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2  [Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl in much 
the same way as with simple salts, for example, 
ScCl3CaCl2  NaCl. Another property he 
studied was isomerism. In 190, he was able 
to isolate a second geometric isomer of 
[Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl, in complete accord with his 
theory. Six years later, Werner won the Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry.
By all accounts, Werner was a superb 
lecturer. Sometimes as many as 300 stu-
dents crowded into a hall with a capacity of 
150 to hear him speak. So great was his 
reputation that students in theology and 
law came to hear him talk about chemistry. 
There was, however, a darker side to 
Werner that few students saw. A young 
woman badgered by Werner during an oral 
examination came to see him later to ask 
whether she had passed; he threw a chair 
at her. Werner died at age 52 of hardening 
of the arteries, perhaps caused in part by 
his addiction to alcohol and strong black 
cigars.

In the uncomplexed transition metal cation, all of these orbitals have the same energy.
Octahedral Complexes
As six ligands approach a central metal ion to form an octahedral complex, they change  
the energies of electrons in the d orbitals. The effect (Figure 19.9, page 604) is to split the 
five d orbitals into two groups of different energy.

chapter nineteen  Complex Ions
The difference in energy between the two groups is called the crystal field splitting en-
ergy and given the symbol Do (the subscript “o” stands for “octahedral”).
To see why this splitting occurs, consider what happens when six ligands (e.g., H2O, 
CN2, NH3) approach a central metal cation along the x-, y-, and z-axes (Figure 19.8, page 
603). The unshared electron pairs on these ligands repel the electrons in the d orbitals of 
the cation. The repulsion is greatest for the dx22y2 and dz2 orbitals, which have their maxi-
mum electron density directly along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. Electrons in the 
other three orbitals (dxy, dyz, dxz) are less affected because their densities are concen-
trated between the axes rather than along them.
Depending on the magnitude of Do, a cation may form either of two different kinds 
of complexes. This is illustrated for the Fe21 ion in the two diagrams in Figure 19.10.
	 1.  In the Fe(CN)642 ion shown at the left, Do is so large that the six 3d electrons of the 
Fe21 ion pair up in the lower energy orbitals. In this way, the Fe21 ion achieves its 
most stable (lowest energy) electronic structure. The complex is diamagnetic, with 
no unpaired electrons.
	 2.  In the Fe(H2O)621 ion shown at the right, Do is relatively small, and the six 3d electrons 
of the Fe21 ion spread out over all the orbitals as expected by Hund’s rule. In other 
words, the electron distribution in the complex is the same as in the Fe21 ion itself 
(where Do is 0!). The Fe(H2O)621 ion is paramagnetic, with four unpaired electrons.
More generally, it is possible to distinguish between
•	 low-spin complexes, containing the minimum number of unpaired electrons, formed 
when Do is large; electrons are concentrated in the lower energy orbitals.
•	 high-spin complexes, containing the maximum number of unpaired electrons, 
formed when Do is small; electrons are spread out among the d orbitals, exactly as in 
the uncomplexed transition metal cation.

five d orbitals have the same energy. 
When the ion forms an octahedral 
complex, two orbitals (dz2, dx22y2) have 
a higher energy than the other three 
(dxy, dyz, dxz). The difference in energy 
between the two d orbital levels in the 
octahedral complex is known as the 
crystal field splitting energy and has the 
symbol Do.
This gives the dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals a 
lower energy.

followed.

19.4  electronic structure of complex ions
For a given cation,
•	 the high-spin complex always contains more unpaired electrons than the low-spin 
complex and so is more strongly paramagnetic.
•	 the value of Do is determined by the nature of the ligand. So-called “strong-field” li-
gands (e.g., CN2), which interact strongly with d-orbital electrons, produce a large 
Do. Conversely, “weak-field” ligands (e.g., H2O) interact weakly with d-orbital elec-
trons, producing a small Do.
Remember: 
strong-field ligands : large Do : 
low spin complex 
weak-field ligands : small Do : 
high spin complex
example 19.6
Derive the electron distribution of the Fe31 ion in the low-spin and high-spin octahedral complexes.
strategy
1. Write the abbreviated electron configurations for Fe and then for Fe31.
2. For the high-spin complex, follow Hund’s rule in distributing the electrons to all orbitals.
3. For the low-spin complex, follow Hund’s rule in distributing the electrons first to the lower orbitals. If there are any elec-
trons left, fill the upper orbitals, again following Hund’s rule.

This model of the electronic structure of complex ions explains why high-spin and 
low-spin complexes occur only with ions that have four to seven electrons (d4, d5, d6, d7). 
With three or fewer electrons, only one distribution is possible; the same is true with 
eight or more electrons.

Color
Most coordination compounds are brightly colored except for those of cations whose d 
sublevels are completely empty (such as Sc31) or completely filled (such as Zn21). These 
colors are readily explained, at least qualitatively, by the model we have just described. 
The energy difference between two sets of d orbitals in a complex is ordinarily equal to 
that of a photon in the visible region. Hence by absorbing visible light, an electron may 
be able to move from the lower energy set of d orbitals to the higher one. This removes 
some of the component wavelengths of white light, so that the light reflected or transmit-
ted by the complex is colored. The relation between absorbed and transmitted light can 
be deduced from the color wheel shown in Figure 19.11 (page 606). For example, a com-
plex that absorbs blue-green light appears orange, and vice versa.
From the color (absorption spectrum) of a complex ion, it is sometimes possible to 
deduce the value of Do, the crystal field splitting energy. The situation is particularly 
simple in 22Ti31, which contains only one 3d electron. Consider, for example, the 
Ti(H2O)631 ion, which has an intense purple color. This ion absorbs at 510 nm, in the 
green region. The purple (red-violet) color of a solution of Ti(H2O)631 is what is left over 
when the green component is subtracted from the visible spectrum. Using the equation 
The color we see is what is left 
over after certain wavelengths are  
absorbed.

relating energy to wavelength (Chapter 6), it is possible to calculate the energy of a pho-
ton with a wavelength of 510 nm:

 5 2.35 3 102 kJ/mol
This is the energy absorbed in raising the 3d electron from a lower to a higher orbital. In 
other words, in the Ti(H2O)631 ion, the two sets of d orbitals are separated by this amount 
of energy. The splitting energy, Do, is 235 kJ/mol.

Light absorption and color. The color of a solution is due to the color of the light not

Th e smaller the value of Do, the longer the wavelength of the light absorbed. Th is 
eff ect is shown in Table 19.3 and Figure 19.12. When weak-fi eld ligands such as NCS2, 
H2O, or Cl2 are substituted for NH3, the light absorbed shift s to longer wavelengths 
(lower energies). On the basis of observations like these, ligands can be arranged in or-
der of decreasing tendency to split the d orbitals. A short version of such a spectrochemi-

Chelates: Natural and synthetic
Chelating agents, capable of bonding to metal atoms at more than 
one position, are abundant in nature. Certain species of soybeans 
synthesize and secrete organic chelating agents that extract iron 
from insoluble compounds in the soil, thereby making it available 
to the plant. Mosses and lichens growing on boulders use a similar 
process to obtain the metal ions they need for growth.
Many important natural products are chelates in which a central 
metal atom is bonded into a large organic molecule. In chlorophyll, 
the green coloring matter of plants, the central atom is magne-
sium; in the essential vitamin B12, it is cobalt. The structure of 
heme, the pigment responsible for the red color of blood, is shown 
in Figure A (page 608). There is an Fe21 ion at the center of the 
CHeMISTRY beYOnD the ClaSSrOOM
complex surrounded by four nitrogen atoms at the corners of a 
square. A fi fth coordination position around the iron is occupied by 
the molecule globin, which in combination with heme, gives the 
protein referred to as hemoglobin.
The sixth coordination position of Fe21 in heme is occupied by 
a water molecule that can be replaced reversibly by oxygen to give 
a derivative known as oxyhemoglobin, which has the bright red 
color characteristic of arterial blood.

Photography by Joe Mikuliak
(PO2 5 0.2 atm), the hemoglobin is almost completely converted 
to oxyhemoglobin. In the tissues, the partial pressure of oxygen 
drops, and the oxyhemoglobin breaks down to release O2 essential 
for metabolism. In this way, hemoglobin acts as an oxygen carrier, 
absorbing oxygen in the lungs and liberating it to the tissues.
Unfortunately, hemoglobin forms a complex with carbon mon-
oxide that is considerably more stable than oxyhemoglobin. The 
equili­brium constant for the reaction
hemoglobin  O2(aq) 1 CO(g) EF hemoglobin  CO(aq) 1 O2(g)
is about 200 at body temperature. Consequently, the carbon 
monoxide complex is formed preferentially in the lungs even at CO 
concentrations as low as one part per thousand. When this 
happens, the flow of oxygen to the tissues is cut off, resulting even-
tually in muscular paralysis and death.
Many chelating agents have been synthesized in the laboratory 
to take advantage of their ability to tie up (sequester) metal cations. 
Perhaps the best known synthetic chelating agent is the ethylene-
diaminetetraacetate (EDTA) ion shown in Figure B. EDTA can bond 
at as many as six positions, thereby occupying all the octahedral 
sites surrounding a central metal cation.
EDTA forms 11 complexes with a large number of cations, in-
cluding those of some of the main-group metals. The complex 
formed by calcium with EDTA is used to treat lead poisoning. When 
a solution containing the Ca-EDTA complex is given by injection, the 
calcium is displaced by lead. The more stable Pb-EDTA complex is 
eliminated in the urine. EDTA has also been used to remove radioac-
tive isotopes of metals, notably plutonium, from body tissues.
You may have noticed Ca-EDTA on the list of ingredients of many 
prepared foods, ranging from beer to mayonnaise. EDTA acts as a 
scavenger to pick up traces of metal ions that catalyze the chemical 
reactions responsible for flavor deterioration, loss of color, or ran-
cidity. Typically, Ca-EDTA is added at a level of 30 to 800 ppm.
Still another use of EDTA is in the field of art restoration. Figure 
C shows “before and after” photographs of Rodin’s bronze sculp-
ture “The Thinker.” This stood in front of the Rodin Museum in 
Philadelphia for about 60 years prior to its restoration in 1992. 
Over time the sculpture had picked up a thick coating of insoluble 
CuSO4  3Cu(OH)2(s). Application of a wet paste containing EDTA 
dissolved the coating by forming the soluble Cu(EDTA)22 complex.

s you can see from the periodic table on the inside cover or opening pages of this 
text, the overwhelming majority of elements, about 88%, are metals (shown in blue). 
In discussing the descriptive chemistry of the metals, we concentrate on
• the main-group metals in Groups 1 and 2 at the far left of the periodic table. These 
are commonly referred to as the alkali metals (Group 1) and alkaline earth metals 
(Group 2). The group names reflect the strongly basic nature of the oxides (K2O, 
CaO, . . .) and hydroxides (KOH, Ca(OH)2, . . .) of these elements.
• the transition metals, located in the center of the periodic table. There are three series 
of transition metals, each consisting of ten elements, located in the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth periods. We focus on a few of the more important transition metals (Figure 20.1, 
page 613), particularly those toward the right of the first series.
Section 20.1 deals with the processes by which these metals are obtained from their 
principal ores. Section 20.2 describes the reactions of the alkali and alkaline earth metals, 
particularly those with hydrogen, oxygen, and water. Section 20.3 considers the redox 
chemistry of the transition metals, their cations (e.g., Fe21, Fe31), and their oxoanions (e.g., 
CrO422).

20.1 Metallurgy
The processes by which metals are extracted from their ores fall within the science of 
metallurgy. As you might expect, the chemical reactions involved depend on the type of 
ore (Figure 20.2). We consider some typical processes used to obtain metals from chlo-
ride, oxide, sulfide, or “native” ores.
Chloride Ores: Na from NaCl
Sodium metal is obtained by the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (Figure 20.3, 
page 614). The electrode reactions are quite simple:
	
cathode:    2Na1(l) 1 2e2 9: 2Na(l)
	
anode:	
2Cl2(l) 9: Cl2(g) 1 2e2
	
	
2NaCl(l) 9: 2Na(l) 1 Cl2(g)
The cell is operated at about 6008C to keep the electrolyte molten; calcium chloride is 
added to lower the melting point. About 14 kJ of electrical energy is required to produce 
one gram of sodium, which is drawn off as a liquid (mp of Na 5 988C). The chlorine gas 
produced at the anode is a valuable byproduct.

20.1  metallurgy
Oxide Ores: Al from Al2O3, Fe from Fe2O3
Oxides of very reactive metals such as calcium or aluminum are reduced by electrolysis. 
In the case of aluminum, bauxite ore, Al2O3, is used.
2Al2O3(l) 9: 4Al(l) 1 3 O2(g)
Cryolite, Na3AlF6, is added to Al2O3 to produce a mixture melting at about 10008C. (A 
mixture of AlF3, NaF, and CaF2 may be substituted for cryolite.) The cell is heated elec-
trically to keep the mixture molten so that ions can move through it, carrying the 
electric current. About 30 kJ of electrical energy is consumed per gram of aluminum 
formed. The high energy requirement explains in large part the value of recycling alu-
minum cans.
The process for obtaining aluminum from bauxite was worked out in 1886 by 
Charles Hall (1863–1914), just after he graduated from Oberlin College. The problem that 
Hall faced was to find a way to electrolyze Al2O3 at a temperature below its melting point 
of 20008C. His general approach was to look for ionic compounds in which Al2O3 would 
dissolve at a reasonable temperature. After several unsuccessful attempts, Hall found 
that cryolite was the ideal “solvent.” Curiously enough, the same electrolytic process was 
worked out by Paul Héroult (1863–1914) in France, also in 1886.
With less active metals, a chemical reducing agent can be used to reduce a metal 
cation to the element. The most common reducing agent in metallurgical processes 
is carbon, in the form of coke or, more exactly, carbon monoxide formed from the 
coke.
The most important metallurgical process involving carbon is the reduction of 
hematite ore, which consists largely of iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3, mixed with silicon diox-
ide, SiO2. Reduction occurs in a blast furnace (Figure 20.4a) typically 30 m high and 
10 m in diameter. The furnace is lined with refractory brick, capable of withstanding 
temperatures that may go as high as 18008C. The solid charge, admitted at the top of 
the furnace, consists of iron ore, coke, and limestone (CaCO3). To get the process 
started, a blast of compressed air or pure O2 at 5008C is blown into the furnace through 
nozzles near the bottom. Several different reactions occur, of which three are most 
important:
Chemistry majors can be very productive.

chapter TWenty  Chemistry of the Metals
1.  Conversion of carbon to carbon monoxide. In the lower part of the furnace, coke 
burns to form carbon dioxide, CO2. As the CO2 rises through the solid mixture, it reacts 
further with the coke to form carbon monoxide, CO. The overall reaction is
2C(s) 1 O2(g) 9: 2CO(g)        DH 5 2221 kJ
The heat given off by this reaction maintains a high temperature within the furnace.
2.  Reduction of Fe31 ions to Fe. The carbon monoxide reacts with the iron(III) 
oxide in the ore:
Fe2O3(s) 1 3CO(g) 9: 2Fe(l) 1 3CO2(g)
Molten iron, formed at a temperature of 16008C, collects at the bottom of the furnace. 
Four or five times a day, it is drawn off. The daily production of iron from a single blast 
furnace is about 1500 metric tons.
3.  Formation of slag. The limestone added to the furnace decomposes at about 
8008C:
CaCO3(s) 9: CaO(s) 1 CO2(g)
The calcium oxide formed reacts with impurities in the iron ore to form a glassy material 
called slag. The main reaction is with SiO2 to form calcium silicate, CaSiO3:
CaO(s) 1 SiO2(s) 9: CaSiO3(l)
The slag, which is less dense than molten iron, forms a layer on the surface of the metal. 
This makes it possible to draw off the slag through an opening in the furnace above that 
is used to remove the iron. The slag is used to make cement and as a base in road 
construction.
The product that comes out of the blast furnace, called “pig iron,” is highly impure. 
On the average, it contains about 4% carbon along with lesser amounts of silicon, man-
ganese, and phosphorus. To make steel from pig iron, the carbon content must be low-
ered below 2%. Most of the steel produced in the world today is made by the basic oxy-
gen process (Figure 20.4b). The “converter” is filled with a mixture of about 70% molten 
iron from the blast furnace, 25% scrap iron or steel, and 5% limestone. Pure oxygen un-
der a pressure of about 10 atm is blown through the molten metal. The reaction
C(s) 1 O2(g) 9: CO2(g)
occurs rapidly; at the same time, impurities such as silicon are converted to oxides, 
which react with limestone to form a slag. When the carbon content drops to the desired 
level, the supply of oxygen is cut off. At this stage, the steel is ready to be poured. The 
whole process takes from 30 min to 1 h and yields about 200 metric tons of steel in a 
single “blow.”
This is the key reaction; it produces  
molten iron.

20.1  metallurgy
Sulfide Ores: Cu from Cu2S
Sulfide ores, after preliminary treatment, most often undergo roasting, that is, heating 
with air or pure oxygen. With a relatively reactive transition metal such as zinc, the  
product is the oxide
2ZnS(s) 1 3 O2(g) 9: 2ZnO(s) 1 2SO2(g)
which can then be reduced to the metal with carbon. With sulfides of less reactive metals 
such as copper or mercury, the free metal is formed directly on roasting. The reaction 
with cinnabar, the sulfide ore of mercury, is
HgS(s) 1 O2(g) 9: Hg(g) 1 SO2(g)
Among the several ores of copper, one of the most important is chalcocite, which 
contains copper(I) sulfide, Cu2S, in highly impure form. Rocky material typically 
lowers the fraction of copper in the ore to 1% or less. The Cu2S is concentrated by a 
process called flotation (Figure 20.5), which raises the fraction of copper to 20%–40%. 
The concentrated ore is then converted to the metal by blowing air through it at a high 
temperature, typically above 10008C. (Pure O2 is often used instead of air.) The overall 
reaction that occurs is a simple one:
Cu2S(s) 1 O2(g) 9: 2Cu(s) 1 SO2(g)
The solid produced is called “blister copper.” It has an irregular appearance due to air 
bubbles that enter the copper while it is still molten. Blister copper is impure, containing 
small amounts of several other metals.
Copper is purified by electrolysis. The anode, which may weigh as much as 300 kg, 
is made of blister copper. The electrolyte is 0.5 to 1.0 M CuSO4, adjusted to a pH of about 
0 with sulfuric acid. The cathode is a piece of pure copper, weighing perhaps 150 kg. The 
half-reactions are
	
oxidation:	
Cu(s, impure) 9: Cu21(aq) 1 2e2
	
reduction:	
Cu21(aq) 1 2e2 9: Cu(s, pure)
The overall reaction, obtained by adding these two half-reactions, is
Cu(s, impure) 9: Cu(s, pure)
Because Cu can be produced by  
simple “roasting,” it was one of 
the first metals known.

Thus the net effect of electrolysis is to transfer copper metal from the impure blister cop-
per used as one electrode to the pure copper sheet used as the other electrode. Electro-

20.2  reactions of the alkali and alkaline earth metals
Native Metals: Au
A few very unreactive metals, notably silver and gold, are found in nature in elemental 
form, mixed with large amounts of rocky material. For countless centuries, people 
have extracted gold by taking advantage of its high density (19.3 g/mL). In ancient 
times, gold-bearing sands were washed over sheepskins, which retained the gold; this 
is believed to be the source of the “Golden Fleece” of Greek mythology. The forty-
niners in California obtained gold by swirling gold-bearing sands with water in a pan. 
Less dense impurities were washed away, leaving gold nuggets or flakes at the bottom 
of the pan.
Nowadays, the gold content of ores is much too low for these simple mechanical 
separation methods to be effective. Instead, the ore is treated with very dilute (0.01 M) 
sodium cyanide solution, through which air is blown. The following redox reaction takes 
place:
4Au(s) 1 8CN2(aq) 1 O2(g) 1 2H2O 9: 4Au(CN)22(aq) 1 4 OH2(aq)
The oxidizing agent is O2, which takes gold to the 11 state. The cyanide ion acts as a 
complexing ligand, forming the stable Au(CN)22 ion. Metallic gold is recovered from 
solution by adding zinc; the gold in the complex ion is reduced to the metal.
Zn(s) 1 2Au(CN)22(aq) 9: Zn(CN)422(aq) 1 2Au(s)
20.2 Reactions of the Alkali and Alkaline 
Earth Metals
The metals in Groups 1 and 2 are among the most reactive of all elements (Table 20.1). 
Their low ionization energies and high E8ox values explain why they are so readily oxi-
dized to cations, 11 cations for Group 1, 12 for Group 2. The alkali metals and the 
heavier alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) are commonly stored under dry mineral oil or 
kerosene to prevent them from reacting with oxygen or water vapor in the air. Magne-
sium is less reactive; it is commonly available in the form of ribbon or powder. Berylli-
um, as one would expect from its position in the periodic table, is the least metallic ele-
ment in these two groups. It is also the least reactive toward water, oxygen, or other 
nonmetals.

Reaction with Hydrogen
The compounds formed by the reaction of hydrogen with the alkali and alkaline earth 
metals contain H2 ions; for example, sodium hydride consists of Na1 and H2 ions. These 
white crystalline solids are often referred to as saline hydrides because of their physical 
resemblance to NaCl. Chemically, they behave quite differently from sodium chloride; 
for example, they react with water to produce hydrogen gas. Typical reactions are
NaH(s) 1 H2O(l) 9: H2(g) 1 Na1(aq) 1 OH2(aq)

20.2  reactions of the alkali and alkaline earth metals
In this way, saline hydrides can serve as compact, portable sources of hydrogen gas for 
inflating life rafts and balloons.
Reaction with Water
The alkali metals react vigorously with water (Figure 20.6) to evolve hydrogen and form 
a water solution of the alkali hydroxide. The reaction of sodium is typical:
2Na(s) 1 2H2O(l) 9: 2Na1(aq) 1 2 OH2(aq) 1 H2(g)        DH8 5 2368.6 kJ
The heat evolved in the reaction frequently causes the hydrogen to ignite.
Among the Group 2 metals, Ca, Sr, and Ba react with water in much the same way 
as the alkali metals. The reaction with calcium is
Ca(s) 1 2H2O(l) 9: Ca21(aq) 1 2 OH2(aq) 1 H2(g)
Beryllium does not react with water at all. Magnesium reacts very slowly with boiling 
water but reacts more readily with steam at high temperatures:
Mg(s) 1 H2O(g) 9: MgO(s) 1 H2(g)
This reaction, like that of sodium with water, produces enough heat to ignite the hydro-
gen. Firefighters who try to put out a magnesium fire by spraying water on it have dis-
covered this reaction, often with tragic results. The best way to extinguish burning mag-
nesium is to dump dry sand on it.
Reaction with Oxygen
Note from Table 20.1 that several different products are possible when an alkali or alka-
line earth metal reacts with oxygen. The product may be a normal oxide (O22 ion), a 
peroxide (O222 ion), or superoxide (O22 ion).

Lithium is the only Group 1 metal that forms the normal oxide in good yield by di-
rect reaction with oxygen. The other Group 1 oxides (Na2O, K2O, Rb2O, Cs2O) must be 
prepared by other means. In contrast, the Group 2 metals usually react with oxygen to 
give the normal oxide. Beryllium and magnesium must be heated strongly to give BeO 
and MgO (Figure 20.7, page 622). Calcium and strontium react more readily to give CaO 
and SrO. Barium, the most reactive of the Group 2 metals, catches fire when exposed to 
moist air. The product is a mixture of the normal oxide BaO (Ba21, O22 ions) and the 
peroxide BaO2 (Ba21, O222 ions). The higher the temperature, the greater the fraction of 
BaO in the mixture.

The oxides of the Group 1 and Group 2 metals are sometimes referred to as “basic anhy-
drides” (bases without water) because of this reaction. The reaction with CaO is referred 
to as the “slaking” of lime; it gives off 65 kJ of heat per mole of Ca(OH)2 formed. A simi-
lar reaction with MgO takes place slowly to form Mg(OH)2, the antacid commonly re-
ferred to as “milk of magnesia.”
When sodium burns in air, the principal product is yellowish sodium peroxide,

Na2O2(s) 1 2H2O(l) 9: 2Na1(aq) 1 2 OH2(aq) 1 H2O2(aq)
Through this reaction, sodium peroxide finds use as a bleaching agent in the pulp and 
paper industry.
The heavier alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) form the superoxide when they burn in air. For 
example,
K(s) 1 O2(g) 9: KO2(s)
Potassium superoxide is used in self-contained breathing devices for firefighters and 
miners. It reacts with the moisture in exhaled air to generate oxygen:
4KO2(s) 1 2H2O(g) 9: 3 O2(g) 1 4KOH(s)
The carbon dioxide in the exhaled air is removed by reaction with the KOH formed:

A person using a mask charged with KO2 can rebreathe the same air for an extended 
period of time. This allows that person to enter an area where there are poisonous gases 
or oxygen-deficient air.

20.3 Redox Chemistry of the Transition Metals
The transition metals, unlike those in Groups 1 and 2, typically show several different 
oxidation numbers in their compounds. This tends to make their redox chemistry more 
complex (and more colorful). Only in the lower oxidation states (11, 12, 13) are the 
transition metals present as cations (e.g., Ag1, Zn21, Fe31). In higher oxidation states 
(14 to 17) a transition metal is covalently bonded to a nonmetal atom, most often 
oxygen.
Reactions of the Transition Metals with Oxygen
Table 20.2 lists the formulas of the oxides formed when the more common transition 
metals react with oxygen. With one exception (Cu2O), the transition metal is present as 
a 12 and/or a 13 ion. In Co3O4 and in other oxides of general formula M3O4, there are 
two different types of cations: 12 and 13. To be specific, there are twice as many 13 as 
12 cations; we might show the composition of Co3O4 as
1Co21 : 2Co31 : 4 O22
We should point out that many oxides of the transition metals beyond those listed 
in Table 20.2 can be prepared indirectly. For example, although silver does not react di-
rectly with oxygen, silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, can be made by treating a solution of a silver 
salt with strong base.
2Ag1(aq) 1 2 OH2(aq) 9: Ag2O(s) 1 H2O
In another case, cobalt(II) oxide can be prepared by heating the carbonate in the absence  
of air.
CoCO3(s) 9: CoO(s) 1 CO2(g)
Many oxides of the transition metals can be nonstoichiometric; the atom ratios of the 
elements differ slightly from whole-number values. Stoichiometric nickel(II) oxide, in 
which the atom ratio is exactly 11 (i.e., Ni1.00O1.00), is a green, nonconducting solid. If 
this compound is heated to 12008C in pure oxygen, it turns black and undergoes a change 
in composition to something close to Ni0.97O1.00. This nonstoichiometric solid was one of 
the early semiconductors; it has the structure shown in Figure 20.8. A few Ni21 ions are 
missing from the crystal lattice; to maintain electrical neutrality, two Ni21 ions are con-
verted to Ni31 ions for each missing Ni21.
Nonstoichiometry is relatively common among “mixed” metal oxides, in which more 
than one metal is present. In 1986 it was discovered that certain compounds of this type 
showed the phenomenon of superconductivity; on cooling to about 100 K, their electrical 
resistance drops to zero (Figure 20.9, page 624). A typical formula here is YBa2Cu3Ox, 
where x varies from 6.5 to 7.2, depending on the method of preparation of the solid.

Reaction of Transition Metals with Acids
Any metal with a positive standard oxidation voltage, E8ox, can be oxidized by the H1 ions 
present in a 1 M solution of a strong acid. All the transition metals in the left column of 
Table 20.3 react spontaneously with dilute solutions of such strong acids as HCl, HBr, 
and H2SO4. The products are hydrogen gas and a cation of the transition metal. A typical 
reaction is that of nickel:
Ni(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Ni21(aq) 1 H2(g)
The end result of this reaction is shown in Figure 20.10. With metals that can form more 
than one cation, such as iron, the reaction product with H1 in the absence of air is ordi-
narily the cation of lower charge, for example, Fe21:

20.3  redox chemistry of the transition metals
Metals with negative values of E8ox , listed at the right of Table 20.3, are too inactive 
to react with hydrochloric acid. The H1 ion is not a strong enough oxidizing agent to 
convert a metal such as copper (E8ox 5 20.339 V) to a cation. However, copper can be 
oxidized by nitric acid. The oxidizing agent is the nitrate ion, NO32, which may be 
reduced to NO2 or NO:

strategy
1. The metals can only be oxidized. Use Table 20.3 to obtain E8ox.
2. An aqueous solution of HCl contains only H1 and Cl2 ions.
 
Only H1 can be reduced to H2. Chloride ions cannot be reduced.
 
Find E8 for the reaction between H1 and the metal. The reaction will occur if E8 . 0.
3. An aqueous solution of HNO3 contains only H1 and NO32 ions.
 
Both H1 and NO32 can be reduced, H1 to H2 and NO32 to NO.
 
Find E8 for the reaction between H1 and the metal and for NO32 and the metal. The reaction will occur if E8 . 0.
4. Write balanced half-­reactions to get the overall equation for the reaction.

Equilibria Between Different Cations  
of a Transition Metal
Several transition metals form more than one cation. For example, chromium forms 
Cr21 and Cr31; copper forms Cu1 and Cu21. Table 20.4 lists values of E8red for several such 
systems. Using the data in this table and in Table 17.1, it is possible to decide on the rela-
tive stabilities of different transition metal cations in water solution.
Cations for which E8red is a large, positive number are readily reduced and hence tend 
to be unstable in water solution. A case in point is the Mn31 ion, which reacts spontane-
ously with water:
2Mn31(aq) 1 H2O(l) 9: 2Mn21(aq) 1 1
2 O2(g) 1 2H1(aq)
E8 5 E8red Mn31 1 E8ox H2O 5 11.559 V 2 1.229 V 5 10.330 V
As a result of this reaction, Mn31 cations are never found in water solution. 
Manganese(III) occurs only in insoluble oxides and hydroxides such as Mn2O3 and 
MnO(OH).
The cations in the center column of Table 20.4 (Cr21, Mn21, . . .) are in an interme-
diate oxidation state. They can be either oxidized to a cation of higher charge 
(Cr21 9: Cr31) or reduced to the metal (Cr21 9: Cr). With certain cations of this 
type, these two half-reactions occur simultaneously. Consider, for example, the Cu1 ion. 
In water solution, copper(I) salts disproportionate, undergoing reduction (to copper 
metal) and oxidation (to Cu21) at the same time:
2Cu1(aq) 9: Cu(s) 1 Cu21(aq);        E8 5 10.518 V 2 0.161 V 5 10.357 V
As a result, the only stable copper(I) species are insoluble compounds such as CuCN or 
complex ions such as Cu(CN)22.
The Cu1 ion is one of the few species in the center column of Table 20.4 that dispro-
portionates in water, undergoing simultaneous reduction to the metal and oxidation to 
a cation of higher charge. However, cations of this type may be unstable for a quite dif-
ferent reason. Water ordinarily contains dissolved air; the O2 in air may oxidize the cat-
ion. When a blue solution of chromium(II) salt is exposed to air, the color quickly 
changes to violet or green as the Cr31 ion is formed by the reaction

2 O2(g) 1 2H1(aq) 9: 2Cr31(aq) 1 H2O    E8 5 11.637 V
As a result of this reaction, chromium(II) salts are difficult to prepare and even more 
difficult to store.
The Fe21 ion (E8ox 5 20.769 V) is much more stable toward oxidation than Cr21. 
However, iron(II) salts in water solution are slowly converted to iron(III) by dissolved 
oxygen. In acidic solution, the reaction is
2Fe21(aq) 1 1
2 O2(g) 1 2H1(aq) 9: 2Fe31(aq) 1 H2O
E8 5 E8ox Fe21 1 E8red O2 5 20.769 V 1 1.229 V 5 10.460 V
Co31 is also rare, except in complexes.

(Hg ! Hg)21.

Using Table 20.4, find
(a) three different cations, in addition to Mn31, that react with H2O to form O2(g) (E8ox H2O ​5 ​21.229 ​V).
(b) another cation, in addition to Cu1, that disproportionates in water.
(c) two other cations, in addition to Cr21 and Fe21, that are oxidized by O2(g) dissolved in water (E8red O2 ​5 ​11.229 ​V).
strategy and solution
Use Table 20.4 and look for two half-reactions (one an oxidation, the other a reduction) that give E8 . 0 when E8red and E8ox 
are combined.
(a) E8red must be larger than 1.229 V since E8ox 5 21.229 V.

Au31: E8red 5 1.400 V
 
	
 Au1: E8red 5 1.695 V
(b) Recall that disproportionation means that the same ion or element is reduced and oxidized.
 
Look at the ions in the middle column and add E8ox and E8red on either side of the ion. Don’t forget to change the sign 
for E8ox.

Oxoanions of the Transition Metals (CrO422, Cr2O722,

Chromium in the 16 state forms two different oxoanions, the yellow chromate ion, 
CrO422, and the red dichromate ion, Cr2O722 (Figure 20.11, page 628). The chromate ion 
is stable in basic or neutral solution; in acid, it is converted to the dichromate ion:

As you might expect from the half-equation for its reduction, the oxidizing strength of 
the dichromate ion decreases as the concentration of H1 decreases (increasing pH).
The Cr2O722 ion can act as an oxidizing agent in the solid state as well as in water 
solution. In particular, it can oxidize the NH41 ion to molecular nitrogen. When a pile of 
ammonium dichromate is ignited, a spectacular reaction occurs (Figure 20.12).

The ammonium dichromate resembles a tiny volcano as it burns, emitting hot gases, 
sparks, and a voluminous green dust of chromium(III) oxide.
Chromates and dichromates are gradually disappearing from chemistry teaching 
laboratories because of concern about their toxicity. Long-term exposure of industrial 
workers to dust containing chromates has, in a few cases, been implicated in lung cancer. 
More commonly, repeated contact with chromate salts leads to skin disorders; a few 
people are extremely allergic to CrO422 and Cr2O722 ions, breaking into a rash on first 
exposure.

Th e permanganate ion, MnO42, has an intense purple color easily visible even in 
very dilute solution.* Crystals of solid potassium permanganate, KMnO4, have a deep 
purple, almost black color. Th is compound is used to treat such diverse ailments as 
“athlete’s foot” and rattlesnake bites. Th ese applications depend on the fact that the 
MnO42 ion is a very powerful oxidizing agent. Th is is especially true in acidic solution, 
where MnO42 is reduced to Mn21:
MnO42(aq) 1 8H1(aq) 1 5e2 9: Mn21(aq) 1 4H2O    E8red 5 11.512 V
In basic solution, MnO42 is reduced to MnO2, with a considerably smaller value of E8red:
MnO42(aq) 1 2H2O 1 3e2 9: MnO2(s) 1 4 OH2(aq)    E8red 5 10.596 V
However, even in basic solution, MnO42 can oxidize water:

E8 5 E8red MnO42 1 E8ox H2O 5 10.596 V 2 0.401 V 5 10.195 V

Essential Metals in Nutrition
Four of the main-group cations are essential in human nutrition 
(Table a). Of these, the most important is Ca21. about 90% of the 
calcium in the body is found in bones and teeth, largely in the form 
of hydroxyapatite, Ca(OH)2  3Ca3(pO4)2. Calcium ions in bones 
and teeth exchange readily with those in the blood; about 0.6 g of 
Ca21 enters and leaves your bones every day. In a normal adult this 
exchange is in balance, but in elderly people, particularly women, 
there is sometimes a net loss of bone calcium, leading to the 
disease known as osteoporosis.
although sodium is an essential metal, it has been statistically 
associated with hypertension. about 50% of people with high 
blood pressure (10% of the general population) are sensitive to 
high concentrations of Na1 ions. For that reason, it is recom-
mended that the daily consumption of Na1 be limited to 2.4 g. The 
simplest way to cut back on Na1 is to read the label carefully before 
buying processed foods, which  account for about 75% of our 
sodium intake. For example, a single serving of packaged scalloped 
potatoes can contain as much as 0.5 g of Na1 ion as opposed to 
only 0.006 g for a large baked potato.
Of the ten trace elements known to be essential to human nutri-
tion, seven are transition metals. For the most part, transition metals

com-
pounds are present as 
complex ions, chelated by 
organic ligands. you will 
recall (Chapter 19) that 
hemoglobin has such a 
structure with Fe21 as the 
central ion of the complex. 
The Co31 ion occupies a 
similar position in vitamin 
B12, octahedrally coordi-
nated 
to 
molecules 
in 
somewhat similar fashion 
to those in hemoglobin.
as you can judge from Table a, transition metal cations are fre-
quently found in enzymes. The Zn21 ion alone is known to be a 
component of at least 70 diff erent enzymes. One of these, re-
ferred to as “alcohol dehydrogenase,” is concentrated in the liver, 
where it acts to break down alcohols. another zinc-containing 
enzyme is involved in the normal functioning of oil glands in the 
skin, which accounts for the use of Zn21 compounds in the treat-
ment of acne.

Although Zn21 is essential to human nutrition, compounds of 
the two elements below zinc in the periodic table, Cd and Hg, are 
extremely toxic. This reflects the fact that Cd21 and Hg21, in con-
trast to Zn21, form very stable complexes with ligands containing 
sulfur atoms. As a result, these two cations react with and thereby 
deactivate enzymes containing !SH groups.

A
pproximately 18 elements are classified as nonmetals; they lie above and to the right 
of the “stairway” that runs diagonally across the periodic table (Figure 21.1, page 634). 
As the word “nonmetal” implies, these elements do not show metallic properties; in 
the solid state they are brittle as opposed to ductile, insulators rather than conductors. Most 
of the nonmetals, particularly those in Groups 15 to 17 of the periodic table, are molecular in 
nature (e.g., N2, O2, F2). The noble gases (Group 18) consist of individual atoms attracted to 
each other by weak dispersion forces. Carbon in Group 14 has a network covalent structure.
As indicated in Figure 21.1, this chapter concentrates on the more common and/or 
more reactive nonmetals, namely,
• nitrogen and phosphorus in Group 15.
• oxygen and sulfur in Group 16.
• the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) in Group 17.
We will consider,
• the properties of these elements and methods of preparing them (Section 21.1).
• their hydrogen compounds (Section 21.2).
• their oxides (Section 21.3).
• their oxoacids and oxoanions (Section 21.4).
For what can so fire us, 
Enrapture, inspire us, 
As Oxygen? What so delicious to quaff?
It is so stimulating, 
And so titillating, 
E’en grey-beards turn freshy, dance, 
caper, and laugh.

chapter Twenty-one  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
21.1 The Elements and Their Preparation
Table 21.1 lists some of the properties of the eight nonmetals considered in this chapter. 
Notice that all of these elements are molecular; those of low molar mass (N2, O2, F2, Cl2) 
are gases at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Figure 21.2, page 635). Stron-
ger dispersion forces cause the nonmetals of higher molar mass to be either liquids (Br2) 
or solids (I2, P4, S8).
Chemical Reactivity
Of the eight nonmetals listed in Table 21.1, nitrogen is by far the least reactive. Its inert-
ness is due to the strength of the triple bond holding the N2 molecule together (bond 
enthalpy (B.E.) for N # N 5 941 kJ/mol). This same factor explains why virtually all 
chemical explosives are compounds of nitrogen (e.g., nitroglycerin, trinitrotoluene, 
ammonium nitrate, lead azide). These compounds detonate exothermically to form 
molecular nitrogen. The reactions with ammonium nitrate and lead azide are

Pb(N3)2(s) 9: Pb(s) 1 3N2(g)	
DH8 5 2476 kJ
Fluorine is the most reactive of all elements, in part because of the weakness of the 
F ! F bond (B.E. F ! F 5 153 kJ/mol), but mostly because it is such a powerful oxidiz-
ing agent (E8red 5 12.889 V). Fluorine combines with every element in the periodic table 
except He and Ne. With a few metals, it forms a surface film of metal fluoride, which

21.1  the elements and their preparation
adheres tightly enough to prevent further reaction. This is the case with nickel, where the 
product is NiF2. Fluorine gas is ordinarily stored in containers made of a nickel alloy, 
such as stainless steel (Fe, Cr, Ni) or Monel (Ni, Cu). Fluorine also reacts with many 
compounds including water, which is oxidized to a mixture of O2, O3, H2O2, and OF2.
Chlorine is somewhat less reactive than fluorine. Although it reacts with nearly all 
metals (Figure 21.3), heating is often required. This reflects the relatively strong bond in 
the Cl2 molecule (B.E. Cl ! Cl 5 243 kJ/mol). Chlorine disproportionates in water, 
forming Cl2 ions (oxid. no. Cl 5 21) and HClO molecules (oxid. no. Cl 5 11).

The hypochlorous acid, HClO, formed by this reaction is a powerful oxidizing agent 
(E8red 5 11.630 V); it kills bacteria, apparently by destroying certain enzymes essential to 
their metabolism. The taste and odor that we associate with “chlorinated water” are actu-
ally due to compounds such as CH3NHCl, produced by the action of hypochlorous acid 
on bacteria.

The oxidizing power of the halogens makes them hazardous to work with. Fluorine 
is the most dangerous, but it is very unlikely that you will ever come across it in a teach-
ing laboratory. You are most likely to encounter chlorine as its saturated water solution, 
called “chlorine water.” Remember that the pressure of chlorine gas over this solution (if 
it is freshly prepared) is 1 atm and that chlorine was used as a poison gas in World War I. 
Use small quantities of chlorine water and don’t breathe the vapors. Bromine, although 
not as strong an oxidizing agent as chlorine, can cause severe burns if it comes in contact 
with your skin, particularly if it gets under your fingernails.
Of the four halogens, iodine is the weakest oxidizing agent. “Tincture of iodine,” a 
10% solution of I2 in alcohol, is sometimes used as an antiseptic. Hospitals most often 
use a product called “povidone-iodine,” a quite powerful iodine-containing antiseptic 
and disinfectant, which can be diluted with water to the desired strength. These applica-
tions of molecular iodine should not delude you into thinking that the solid is harmless. 
On the contrary, if I2(s) is allowed to remain in contact with your skin, it can cause 
painful burns that are slow to heal.

21.1  the elements and their preparation
Occurrence and Preparation
Of the eight nonmetals considered here, three (nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) occur in na-
ture in elemental form. Nitrogen and oxygen are obtained from air, where their mole frac-
tions are 0.7808 and 0.2095, respectively. When liquid air at 22008C (73 K) is allowed to 
warm, the first substance that boils off is nitrogen (bp N2 5  77 K). After most of the nitro-
gen has been removed, further warming gives oxygen (bp O2 5 90 K). About 2 3 1010 kg 
of O2 and lesser amounts of N2 are produced annually in the United States from liquid air.
At the close of the Civil War in 1865, oil prospectors in Louisiana discovered (to 
their disgust) elemental sulfur in the caprock of vast salt domes up to 20 km2 in area. The 
sulfur lies 60 to 600 m below the surface of the earth. The process used to mine sulfur is 
named after its inventor, Herman Frasch (1851–1914), an American chemical engineer 
(born in Germany). A diagram of the Frasch process is shown in Figure 21.4. The sulfur 
is heated to its melting point (1198C) by pumping superheated water at 1658C down one 
of three concentric pipes. Compressed air is used to bring the sulfur to the surface. The 
air and sulfur form a frothy mixture that rises through the middle pipe. On cooling, the 
sulfur solidifies, filling huge vats that may be 0.5 km long. The sulfur obtained in this way 
has a purity approaching 99.9%.
The halogens are far too reactive to occur in nature as the free elements. Instead, 
they are found as halide anions:
•	 F2 in the mineral calcium fluoride, CaF2 (fluorite).
•	 Cl2 in huge underground deposits of sodium chloride, NaCl (rock salt), underlying 
parts of Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas.
•	 Br2(aq) and I2(aq) in brine wells in Arkansas (conc. Br2 5 0.05 M) and Michigan 
(conc. I2 5 0.001 M), respectively.

1658C is sent down through the outer 
pipe to form a pool of molten sulfur 
(mp 5 1198C) at the base. Compressed 
air, pumped down the inner pipe, brings 
the sulfur to the surface. Sulfur deposits 
are often 100 m or more beneath the 
earth’s surface, covered with quicksand 
and rock.
Br2 and I2 can also be obtained from 
seawater.

chapter Twenty-one  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
The fluoride and chloride ions are very difficult to oxidize (E8ox F2 5 22.889 V; E8ox 
Cl2 5 21.360 V). Hence the elements fluorine and chlorine are ordinarily prepared by 
electrolytic oxidation, using a high voltage. As pointed out in Chapter 17, chlorine is 
prepared by the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride:
2Cl2(aq) 1 2H2O 9: Cl2(g) 1 H2(g) 1 2 OH2(aq)
The process used to prepare fluorine was developed by Henri Moissan (1852–1907) in 
Paris in 1886. It won him one of the early (1906) Nobel Prizes in chemistry. The electro-
lyte is a mixture of HF and KF in a 2:1 mole ratio. At 1008C, fluorine is generated by the 
decomposition of hydrogen fluoride:
2HF(l) 9: H2(g) 1 F2(g)
Potassium fluoride furnishes the ions required to carry the electric current.

and 
iodide 
ions 
are 
easier 
to 
oxidize 
(E8oxBr2 5 21.077 V; 
E8oxI2 5 20.534 V), so bromine and iodine can be prepared by chemical oxidation. 
Commonly, the oxidizing agent is chlorine gas (E8red 5 11.360 V):
Cl2(g) 1 2Br2(aq) 9: 2Cl2(aq) 1 Br2(l)
Cl2(g) 1 2I2(aq) 9: 2Cl2(aq) 1 I2(s)
21.2 Hydrogen Compounds of Nonmetals
Table 21.2 lists some of the more important hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals. 
(Those of carbon are discussed in Chapter 22.) The physical states listed are those ob-
served at 258C and 1 atm. The remainder of this section discusses the chemical proper-
ties of the compounds shown in boldface in the table.
Ammonia, NH3
Ammonia is one of the most important industrial chemicals; more than ten million tons 
of NH3 are produced annually in the United States. You will recall (Chapter 12) that it is 
made by the Haber process
N2(g) 1 3H2(g) EF 2NH3(g)        4508C, 200–600 atm, solid catalyst
Ammonia is used to make fertilizers and a host of different nitrogen compounds, nota-
bly nitric acid, HNO3.
The NH3 molecule acts as a Brønsted-Lowry base in water, accepting a proton from 
a water molecule:

complex ion

Ammonia is often used to precipitate insoluble metal hydroxides such as Al(OH)3. 
The OH2 ions formed when ammonia reacts with water precipitate the cation from solu-
tion as the hydroxide. The overall equation for the reaction is
Al31(aq) 1 3NH3(aq) 1 3H2O 9: Al(OH)3(s) 1 3NH41(aq)
Nitrogen cannot have an oxidation number lower than 23, which means that when 
NH3 takes part in a redox reaction, it always acts as a reducing agent. Ammonia may be 
oxidized to elementary nitrogen or to a compound of nitrogen. An important redox re-
action of ammonia is that with hypochlorite ion:
2NH3(aq) 1 ClO2(aq) 9: N2H4(aq) 1 Cl2(aq) 1 H2O
Hydrazine, N2H4, is made commercially by this process. Certain byproducts of this reac-
tion, notably NH2Cl and NHCl2, are both toxic and explosive, so solutions of household 
bleach and ammonia should never be mixed with one another.
Hydrogen Sulfide, H2S
In water solution, hydrogen sulfide acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid; it can donate a proton 
to a water molecule:
H2S(aq) 1 H2O EF HS2(aq) 1 H3O1(aq)        Ka 5 1.0 3 1027
Like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide can act as a precipitating agent toward metal cations. 
The reaction with Cd21 is typical:
Cd21(aq) 1 H2S(aq) 9: CdS(s) 1 2H1(aq)
Like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide (oxid. no. S 5 22) can act only as a reducing agent 
when it takes part in redox reactions. Most often the H2S is oxidized to elementary sul-
fur, as in the reaction
2H2S(aq) 1 O2(g) 9: 2S(s) 1 2H2O
The sulfur formed is often very finely dispersed, which explains why aqueous solutions 
of hydrogen sulfide in contact with air have a milky appearance.
If you’ve worked with H2S in the laboratory, you won’t soon forget its rotten-egg 
odor. In a sense, it’s fortunate that hydrogen sulfide has such a distinctive odor. This gas 
is highly toxic, as poisonous as HCN. At a concentration of 10 parts per million, H2S can 
cause headaches and nausea; at 100 ppm it can be fatal.
The NH3 molecule donates an electron 
pair to Ag1.
example 21.2
When a solution containing Cu21 is treated with hydrogen sulfide, a black precipitate forms. When another portion of the 
solution is treated with ammonia, a blue precipitate forms. This precipitate dissolves in excess ammonia to form a deep blue 
solution containing the Cu(NH3)421 ion. Write balanced net ionic equations to explain these observations.

chapter Twenty-one  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Hydrogen Peroxide
In hydrogen peroxide, oxygen has an oxidation number of 21, intermediate between the 
extremes for the element, 0 and 22. This means that H2O2 can act as either an oxidizing 
agent, in which case it is reduced to H2O, or as a reducing agent, when it is oxidized to 
O2. In practice, hydrogen peroxide is an extremely strong oxidizing agent:
H2O2(aq) 1 2H1(aq) 1 2e2 9: 2H2O        E8red 5 11.763 V
but a very weak reducing agent:
H2O2(aq) 9: O2(g) 1 2H1(aq) 1 2e2        E8ox 5 20.695 V
Hydrogen peroxide tends to decompose in water, which explains why its solutions soon 
lose their oxidizing power. The reaction involved is disproportionation, combining the 
two half-reactions referred to above:
	
H2O2(aq) 1 2H1(aq) 1 2e2 9: 2H2O	
E8red 5 11.763 V
	
H2O2(aq) 9: O2(g) 1 2H1(aq) 1 2e2	
E8ox 5 20.695 V
	
2H2O2(aq) 9: O2(g) 1 2H2O	
E8 5 11.068 V
This reaction is catalyzed by a wide variety of materials, including I2 ions, MnO2, metal 
surfaces (Pt, Ag), and even by traces of OH2 ions dissolved from glass.
You are most likely to come across hydrogen peroxide as its water solution. Solu-
tions available in a drugstore for medicinal use contain 3% to 6% by mass of H2O2. In-
dustrially, concentrations as high as 86% H2O2 are available. All water solutions of hy-
drogen peroxide contain stabilizers to prevent disproportionation from taking place 
during storage.
strategy and solution
1. The black precipitate is CuS.
    Cu21(aq) 1 H2S(aq) !: CuS(s) 1 2H1(aq)
2. An aqueous solution of ammonia consists of NH3 and H2O. Since the blue precipitate must be Cu(OH)2, water has to 
be a reactant.
    Cu21(aq) 1 2NH3(aq) 1 2H2O !: Cu(OH)2(s) 1 2NH41(aq)
3. The precipitate, Cu(OH)2, reacts with excess ammonia to form Cu(NH3)421.

21.2  hydrogen compounds of nonmetals
Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrogen Chloride
The most common hydrogen halides are HF (U.S. production 5 3 3 108 kg/yr) and HCl 
(3 3 109 kg/yr). They are most familiar as water solutions, referred to as hydrofluoric 
acid and hydrochloric acid, respectively. Recall (Chapter 13) that hydrofluoric acid is 
weak, incompletely dissociated in water, whereas HCl is a strong acid.
	
HF(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 F2(aq)	
Ka 5 6.9 3 1024
HCl(aq) 9: H1(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)    Ka 9: `
The difference in Ka values is due largely to the difference in bond strength. The H 9 F 
bond (bond enthalpy 5 565 kJ/mol) is much stronger than the H 9 Cl bond (bond en-
thalpy 5 431 kJ/mol).
Hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids undergo very similar reactions with bases such 
as OH2 or CO322 ions. The equations for these reactions look somewhat different be-
cause of the difference in acid strength. Thus for the reaction of hydrochloric acid with a 
solution of sodium hydroxide, the equation is simply
H1(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: H2O
With hydrofluoric acid, the equation is
HF(aq) 1 OH2(aq) 9: H2O 1 F2(aq)
HF appears in this equation because aqueous hydrofluoric acid is weak, containing many 
more HF molecules than H1 ions. Similarly, for the reaction of these two acids with a 
solution of sodium carbonate:
	
hydrochloric acid:        2H1(aq) 1 CO322(aq) 9: CO2(g) 1 H2O
hydrofluoric acid:        2HF(aq) 1 CO322(aq) 9: CO2(g) 1 H2O 1 2F2(aq)
Concentrated hydrofluoric acid reacts with glass, which can be considered to be a 
mixture of SiO2 and ionic silicates such as calcium silicate, CaSiO3:
SiO2(s) 1 4HF(aq) 9: SiF4(g) 1 2H2O
CaSiO3(s) 1 6HF(aq) 9: SiF4(g) 1 CaF2(s) 1 3H2O
As you might guess, HF solutions are never stored in glass bottles; plastic is used instead. 
Hydrofluoric acid is sometimes used to etch glass. The glass object is first covered with a 
thin protective coating of wax or plastic. Then the coating is removed from the area to be 
etched and the glass is exposed to the HF solution. Thermometer stems and burets can 
be etched or light bulbs frosted in this way.
Hydrogen fluoride is a very unpleasant chemical to work with. If spilled on the skin, 
it removes Ca21 ions from the tissues, forming insoluble CaF2. A white patch forms that

is agonizingly painful to the touch. To make matters worse, HF is a local anesthetic, so a 
person may be unaware of what is happening until it is too late.
Rest assured that you will never have occasion to use hydrofluoric acid in the gen-
eral chemistry laboratory. Neither are you likely to come in contact with HBr or HI, both 
of which are relatively expensive. Hydrochloric acid, on the other hand, is a workhorse 
chemical of the teaching laboratory. It is commonly available as “dilute HCl” (6 M) or 
“concentrated HCl” (12 M). You will use it as a source of H1 ions for such purposes as

21.3 Oxygen Compounds of Nonmetals
Table 21.3 lists some of the more familiar nonmetal oxides. Curiously enough, only 
5 of the 21 compounds shown are thermodynamically stable at 258C and 1 atm 
(P4O10, P4O6, SO3, SO2, I2O5). The others, including all of the oxides of nitrogen and 
chlorine, have positive free energies of formation at 258C and 1 atm. For example, 
DGf8 NO2(g) 5 151.3 kJ; DGf8 ClO2(g) 5 1120.6 kJ. Kinetically, these compounds 
stay around long enough to have an extensive chemistry. Nitrogen dioxide, a  
reddish-brown gas, is a major factor in the formation of photochemical smog

The Lewis structures of the oxides of nitrogen are shown in Figure 21.6. Two of these

chapter Twenty-one  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Nitric oxide (NO) is a minor but villainous component of the atmosphere. It is in-
volved in the formation of both smog (Chapter 11) and acid rain (Chapter 14). You may 
be surprised to learn that small amounts of NO are also produced in the human body, 
where it has a generally beneficial effect. In particular, it has the ability to dilate blood 
vessels, lowering blood pressure and reducing the likelihood of strokes or heart attacks. 
Beyond that, NO is effective in treating what television commercials refer to as “erectile 
dysfunction”; it increases blood flow to the penis.
Perhaps the best known oxide of nitrogen is N2O, commonly called nitrous oxide or 
“laughing gas.” Nitrous oxide is frequently used as an anesthetic, particularly in dentistry. 
It is also the propellant gas used in whipped cream containers; N2O is nontoxic, virtually 
tasteless, and quite soluble in vegetable oils. The N2O molecule, like all those in Figure

Of the two oxides of phosphorus, P4O6 and P4O10, the latter is the more stable; it is 
formed when white phosphorus burns in air:
P4(s) 1 5 O2(g) 9: P4O10(s)
Note from Figure 21.7 (page 645) that in both oxides, as in P4 itself, the four phosphorus 
atoms are at the corners of a tetrahedron. The P4O6 molecule can be visualized as derived 
from P4 by inserting an oxygen atom between each pair of phosphorus atoms. In P4O10, 
an extra oxygen atom is bonded to each phosphorus.
In a limited supply of air, some P4O6 is 
formed.

Reactions of Nonmetal Oxides with Water
Many nonmetal oxides are acidic in the sense that they react with water to form acids. 
Looking at the reaction
SO3(g) 1 H2O(l) 9: H2SO4(l)
you can see that sulfur trioxide is an acidic oxide. Notice that in this reaction, the non-
metal does not change oxidation number; sulfur is in the 16 state in both SO3 and 
H2SO4. Other acidic oxides include N2O5 and N2O3:
 
15 nitrogen:         N2O5(s) 1 H2O(l) 9: 2HNO3(l)
13 nitrogen:        N2O3(g) 1 H2O(l) 9: 2HNO2(aq)
The products are nitric acid, HNO3, and an aqueous solution of nitrous acid, HNO2.
One of the most important reactions of this type involves the 15 oxide of phospho-
rus, P4O10. Here the product is phosphoric acid, H3PO4:
P4O10(s) 1 6H2O(l) 9: 4H3PO4(s)
This reaction is used to prepare high-purity phosphoric acid and salts of that acid for use 
in food products. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, is added in small amounts to soft drinks to 
give them a tart taste. It is present to the extent of about 0.05 mass percent in colas,  
0.01 mass percent in root beers.

21.4 Oxoacids and Oxoanions
Table 21.4 lists some of the more important oxoacids of the nonmetals. In all these com-
pounds, the ionizable hydrogen atoms are bonded to oxygen, not to the central non-
metal atom. Dissociation of one or more protons from the oxoacid gives the correspond-
ing oxoanion (Figure 21.8).
In this section we discuss the principles that allow you to predict the relative acid 
strengths of oxoacids such as those listed in Table 21.4. Then we consider their strengths 
as oxidizing and/or reducing agents. Finally, we take a closer look at the chemistry of 
three important oxoacids: HNO3, H2SO4, and H3PO4.
Acid Strength
The acid equilibrium constants of the oxoacids of the halogens are listed in Table 21.5. 
Notice that the value of Ka increases with
•	 increasing oxidation number of the central atom 
(HClO , HClO2 , HClO3 , HClO4)
•	 increasing electronegativity of the central atom 
(HIO , HBrO , HClO)
These trends are general ones, observed with other oxoacids of the nonmetals. Recall, for 
example, that nitric acid, HNO3 (oxid. no. N 5 15), is a strong acid, completely ionized in 
water. In contrast, nitrous acid, HNO2 (oxid. no. N 5 13), is a weak acid (Ka 5 6.0 3 1024). 
The electronegativity effect shows up with the strengths of the oxoacids of sulfur and 
selenium:
Ka1 H2SO3 5 1.7 3 1022        Ka1 H2SeO3 5 2.7 3 1023        (E.N. S 5 2.6, Se 5 2.5)

21.4  oxoacids and oxoanions
Trends in acid strength can be explained in terms of molecular structure. In an 
oxoacid molecule, the hydrogen atom that dissociates is bonded to oxygen, which in 
turn is bonded to a nonmetal atom, X. The ionization in water of an oxoacid H 9 O 9 X 
can be represented as
H 9 O 9 X(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 XO2(aq)
For a proton, with its 11 charge, to separate from the molecule, the electron density 
around the oxygen should be as low as possible. This will weaken the O 9 H bond and 
favor ionization. The electron density around the oxygen atom is decreased when—
•	 X is a highly electronegative atom such as Cl. This draws electrons away from the 
oxygen atom and makes hypochlorous acid stronger than hypoiodous acid.
•	 Additional, strongly electronegative oxygen atoms are bonded to X. These tend to 
draw electrons away from the oxygen atom bonded to H. Thus we would predict that 
the ease of dissociation of a proton, and hence Ka, should increase in the following 
order, from left to right:
X9O9H < O9X9O9H < O9X9O9H < O9X9O9H

chapter Twenty-one  Chemistry of the Nonmetals
Oxidizing and Reducing Strength
Many of the reactions of oxoacids and oxoanions involve oxidation and reduction. There 
are certain general principles that apply, regardless of the particular species involved.
 1. A species in which a nonmetal is in its highest oxidation state can act only as an 
oxidizing agent, never as a reducing agent. Consider, for example, the ClO42 ion, 
in which chlorine is in its highest oxidation state, 17. In any redox reaction in 
which this ion takes part, chlorine must be reduced to a lower oxidation state. When 
that happens, the ClO42 ions act as an oxidizing agent, taking electrons away from 
something else. The same argument applies to
•	 the SO422 ion (highest oxid. no. S 5 16).
•	 the NO32 ion (highest oxid. no. N 5 15).
Note that, in general, the highest oxidation number of a nonmetal is given by the sec-
ond digit of its group number (17 for Cl, 16 for S, 15 for N).
	 2.	 A species in which a nonmetal is in an intermediate oxidation state can act as ei-
ther an oxidizing agent or a reducing agent. Consider, for example, the ClO32 ion 
(oxid. no. Cl 5 15). It can be oxidized to the perchlorate ion, in which case ClO32 
acts as a reducing agent:
ClO32(aq) 1 H2O 9: ClO42(aq) 1 2H1(aq) 1 2e2        E8ox 5 21.226 V
Alternatively, the ClO32 ion can be reduced, perhaps to a Cl2 ion. When that oc-
curs, ClO32 acts as an oxidizing agent:
ClO32(aq) 1 6H1(aq) 1 6e2 9: Cl2(aq) 1 3H2O        E8red 5 11.442 V
Notice that the ClO32 ion is a much stronger oxidizing agent (E8red 5 11.442 V) 
than reducing agent (E8ox 5 21.226 V). This is generally true of oxoanions and oxo-
acids in an intermediate oxidation state, at least in acidic solution. Compare, for 
example,
	
HClO	
E8red (to Cl2)  5 	11.630 V;	
E8ox (to HClO2) 5 21.157 V
	
HNO2	
E8red (to NO) 5 11.036 V;	
E8ox (to NO2) 5 21.056 V
 3.	 Sometimes, with a species such as ClO32, oxidation and reduction occur together, 
resulting in disproportionation:
4ClO32(aq) 9: 3ClO42(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)        E8 5 10.216 V
In general, a species in an intermediate oxidation state is expected to dispropor-
tionate if the sum E8ox 1 E8red is a positive number.

21.4  oxoacids and oxoanions
 4.	 The oxidizing strength of an oxoacid or oxoanion is greatest at high [H1] (low 
pH). Conversely, its reducing strength is greatest at low [H1] (high pH).
This principle has a simple explanation. Looking back at the half-equations above, 
you can see that
•	 when ClO32 acts as an oxidizing agent, the H1 ion is a reactant, so increasing its 
concentration makes the process more spontaneous.
•	 when ClO32 acts as a reducing agent, the H1 ion is a product; to make the pro-
cess more spontaneous, [H1] should be lowered.

Calculate Ered and Eox at 258C for the ClO32 ion in neutral solution, at pH 7.00, assuming all other species are at standard 
concentration (E8red ​5 ​11.442 ​V; E8ox 5 ​21.226 ​V). Will the ClO32 ion disproportionate at pH 7.00?

Nitric Acid, HNO3
Commercially, nitric acid is made by a three-step process developed by the German 
physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald (1853–1932). The starting material is ammonia, which 
is burned in an excess of air at 9008C, using a platinum-rhodium catalyst:
4NH3(g) 1 5 O2(g) 9: 4NO(g) 1 6H2O(g)
The gaseous mixture formed is cooled and mixed with more air to convert NO to NO2:
2NO(g) 1 O2(g) 9: 2NO2(g)
Finally, nitrogen dioxide is bubbled through water to produce nitric acid:
3NO2(g) 1 H2O(l) 9: NO(g) 1 2HNO3(aq)
Nitric acid is a strong acid, completely ionized to H1 and NO32 ions in dilute water 
solution:
HNO3(aq) 9: H1(aq) 1 NO32(aq)
Many of the reactions of nitric acid are those associated with all strong acids. For ex-
ample, dilute (6 M) nitric acid can be used to dissolve aluminum hydroxide
Al(OH)3(s) 1 3H1(aq) 9: Al31(aq) 1 3H2O
or to generate carbon dioxide gas from calcium carbonate:
CaCO3(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Ca21(aq) 1 CO2(g) 1 H2O
Referring back to Example 21.4, you will find that these equations are identical with 
those written for the reactions of hydrochloric acid with Al(OH)3 and CaCO3. It is the 
H1 ion that reacts in either case: Cl2 and NO32 ions take no part in the reactions and 
hence do not appear in the equation.
Concentrated (16 M) nitric acid is a strong oxidizing agent; the nitrate ion is re-
duced to nitrogen dioxide. This happens when 16 M HNO3 reacts with copper metal 
(Figure 21.9):
Cu(s) 1 4H1(aq) 1 2NO32(aq) 9: Cu21(aq) 1 2NO2(g) 1 2H2O
Dilute nitric acid (6 M) gives a wide variety of reduction products, depending on the 
nature of the reducing agent. With inactive metals such as copper (E8ox 5 20.339 V), the 
major product is usually NO (oxid. no. N 5 12):
3Cu(s) 1 2NO32(aq) 1 8H1(aq) 9: 3Cu21(aq) 1 2NO(g) 1 4H2O
With very dilute acid and a strong reducing agent such as zinc (E8ox 5 10.762 V) reduc-
tion may go all the way to the NH41 ion (oxid. no. N 5 23):
4Zn(s) 1 NO32(aq) 1 10H1(aq) 9: 4Zn21(aq) 1 NH41(aq) 1 3H2O
As you would expect, the oxidizing strength of the NO32 ion drops off sharply as pH 
increases; the reduction voltage (to NO) is 10.964 V at pH 0, 10.412 V at pH 7, and 
20.140 V at pH 14. The nitrate ion is a very weak oxidizing agent in basic solution.
end point
Notice that E is the same as E8, 10.216 V. You could have predicted that (and saved a lot of work!), because the overall 
equation for the disproportionation
    4ClO32(aq) !: 3ClO42(aq) 1 Cl2(aq)
does not involve H1 or OH2 ions.
Charles D. Winters

brown fumes are NO2(g), a reduction 
product of HNO3. The copper is oxi-

color to the solution. (The penny is an 
old one made of solid copper. Newer 
pennies have a coating of copper over 
a zinc core.)
You can always smell NO2 over 16 M 
HNO3.

21.4  oxoacids and oxoanions
Concentrated nitric acid (16 M) is colorless when pure. In sunlight, it turns yellow 
(Figure 21.10) because it decomposes to NO2(g):
4HNO3(aq) 9: 4NO2(g) 1 2H2O 1 O2(g)
The yellow color that appears on your skin if it comes in contact with nitric acid has quite  
a different explanation. Nitric acid reacts with proteins to give a yellow material called 
xanthoprotein.
Sulfuric Acid, H2SO4
Sulfuric acid is made commercially by a three-step contact process. First, elemental sulfur 
is burned in air to form sulfur dioxide:
S(s) 1 O2(g) 9: SO2(g)

Write a balanced net ionic equation for the reaction of nitric acid with insoluble copper(II) sulfide; the products include 
Cu21, S(s), and NO2(g).

The sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfur trioxide by bringing it into contact with oxygen 
on the surface of a solid catalyst:
SO2(g) 1 1
2 O2(g) 9: SO3(g)
The catalyst used is vanadium (V) oxide, V2O5, at a temperature of 4508C to 6008C. Sul-
fur trioxide is an acidic oxide that reacts with water to form sulfuric acid.
SO3(g) 1 H2O(l) 9: H2SO4(l)
Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, completely ionized to H1 and HSO42 ions in dilute 
water solution. The HSO42 ion, in contrast, is only partially ionized.

Most of the H1 ions come from the first ionization; in 0.10 M H2SO4, [H1] 5 0.11 M.
Sulfuric acid is a relatively weak oxidizing agent; most often it is reduced to sulfur 
dioxide:
SO422(aq) 1 4H1(aq) 1 2e2 9: SO2(g) 1 2H2O        E8red 5 10.155 V
This is the case when copper metal is oxidized by hot concentrated sulfuric acid:
Cu(s) 1 4H1(aq) 1 SO422(aq) 9: Cu21(aq) 1 2H2O 1 SO2(g)
When dilute sulfuric acid (3 M) reacts with metals, it is ordinarily the H1 ion rather 
than the SO422 ion that is reduced. For example, zinc reacts with dilute sulfuric acid to 
form hydrogen gas:
Zn(s) 1 2H1(aq) 9: Zn21(aq) 1 H2(g)
Concentrated sulfuric acid, in addition to being an acid and an oxidizing agent, is also 
a dehydrating agent. Small amounts of water can be removed from organic liquids such as 
gasoline by extraction with sulfuric acid. Sometimes it is even possible to remove the ele-
ments of water from a compound by treating it with 18 M H2SO4. This happens with table 
sugar, C12H22O11; the product is a black char that is mostly carbon (Figure 21.11).
C12H22O11(s) 9: 12C(s) 1 11H2O
When concentrated sulfuric acid dissolves in water, a great deal of heat is given off, 
nearly 100 kJ per mole of H2SO4. Sometimes enough heat is evolved to bring the solution 
to the boiling point. To prevent this and to avoid splattering, the acid should be added 
When sulfuric acid is added to
sugar (sucrose), an exothermic
reaction occurs.
The elements of water are removed

sulfuric acid can cause painful chemical burns. Never add water to concentrated H2SO4!
Phosphoric Acid, H3PO4
In water solution, 15 phosphorus can be present as
• the H3PO4 molecule (Ka 5 7.1 3 1023), which is a (relatively strong) weak acid. A 
0.10 M solution of H3PO4 has a pH of 1.6.
• the H2PO42 ion (Ka 5 6.2 3 1028; Kb 5 1.4 3 10212) is a (very) weak acid. A 0.10 M 
solution of NaH2PO4 has a pH of 4.
• the HPO422 ion (Ka 5 4.5 3 10213; Kb 5 1.6 3 1027) is a (very) weak base. A 0.10 M 
solution of Na2HPO4 has a pH of 10.
• the PO432 ion (Kb 5 2.2 3 1022) is a (relatively strong) weak base. A 0.10 M solution 
of Na3PO4 has a pH of 12.7.
Of the three compounds NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, and Na3PO4, two are used as cleaning 
agents: NaH2PO4 in acid-type cleaners, Na3PO4 in strongly basic cleaners. Th e principal 
use of Na2HPO4 is in the manufacture of cheese. Around 1915, J. L. Kraft  (1874–1953) 
discovered that this compound is an excellent emulsifying agent. To this day no one 
quite understands why this happens.
A great many “phosphates” are used in commercial fertilizers. Perhaps the most impor-
tant of these is calcium dihydrogen phosphate, Ca(H2PO4)2. In relatively pure form, this com-
pound is known as “triple superphosphate of lime.” A 12 mol mixture of Ca(H2PO4)2 and 
gypsum, CaSO4  2H2O, is commonly referred to as “superphosphate of lime.”
Arsenic and Selenium
Arsenic and selenium, which fall directly below phosphorus and 
sulfur in the periodic table, are of interest for a variety of reasons. 
Arsenic is a true metalloid. A metallic form, called gray arsenic, has 
an electrical conductivity approaching that of lead. Another allo-
trope, yellow arsenic, is distinctly nonmetallic; it has the molecular 
formula As4, analogous to 
white phosphorus, P4. Se-
lenium is properly classi-
fi ed as a nonmetal, al-
though one of its allotropes 
has a somewhat metallic

Physiological 
Properties
The “arsenic poison” re-
ferred to in true-crime dramas is actually the oxide of arsenic, 
As2O3, rather than the element itself. less than 0.1 g of this white, 
slightly soluble powder can be fatal. The classic symptoms of acute 
arsenic poisoning involve various unpleasant gastrointestinal dis-
turbances, severe abdominal pain, and burning of the mouth and 
throat.
In the modern forensic chemistry laboratory (Figure B) arsenic is 
detected by analysis of hair samples, where the element tends to con-
centrate in chronic arsenic poisoning. A single strand of hair is suﬃ  -

cient to establish the presence or absence of the element. The tech-
nique most commonly used is neutron activation analysis, described 
in Chapter 18. If the concentration found is greater than about 
0.0003%, poisoning is indicated; normal arsenic levels are much 
lower than this.
This technique was applied in the early 1960s to a lock of hair 
taken from Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) on St. Helena. 
Arsenic levels of up to 50 times normal suggested he may have 
been a victim of poisoning, perhaps on orders from the French 
royal family.
Arsenic is a known human carcinogen, found in drinking water 
in many parts of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
has set the upper limit for arsenic in drinking water at ten parts per 
billion (10 ppb). The legal limit in the United States, set by the En-
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA) is 50 ppb.
It has long been known that high concentrations of selenium are 
toxic. The cattle disease known picturesquely as “blind staggers” 
arises from grazing on grass growing in soil with a high selenium 
content. It is now known, however, that selenium is an essential 
element in human nutrition. A selenium-containing enzyme, gluta-
thione peroxidase, in combination with vitamin E, destroys harmful 
free radicals in the body.
There is considerable evidence to suggest that selenium com-
pounds are anticarcinogens. For one thing, tests with laboratory 
animals show that the incidence and size of malignant tumors are 
reduced when a solution containing Na2SeO3 is injected at the part 
per million level. Beyond that evidence, statistical studies show an 
inverse correlation between selenium levels in the soil and the in-
cidence of certain types of cancer.

rganic chemistry deals with the compounds of carbon, of which there are literally 
millions. More than 90% of all known compounds contain carbon atoms. There is a 
simple explanation for this remarkable fact. Carbon atoms bond to one another to 
a far greater extent than do atoms of any other element. Carbon atoms may link together 
to form chains or rings.

two single bonds and a double bond, two double bonds, or one single bond and a triple 
bond. One way or another, though, the bonds add up to four.
3.	 Carbon atoms may be bonded to each other or to other nonmetal atoms, most 
often hydrogen, a halogen, oxygen, or nitrogen. In most organic compounds:
• a hydrogen or halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) forms one covalent bond, ! H, ! X
• an oxygen atom forms two covalent bonds, ! O ! or " O
• a nitrogen atom forms three covalent bonds, 9N9, " N !, or # N
In this chapter, we consider
• the simplest type of organic compound, called a hydrocarbon, which contains only two 
kinds of atoms, hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons can be classified as alkanes 
(Section 22.1), alkenes and alkynes (Section 22.2), and aromatics (Section 22.3).
• organic compounds containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon and 
hydrogen (Section 22.4).
• the phenomenon of isomerism, which is very common among organic compounds. 
This topic is introduced in Section 22.1 but discussed more generally in Section 22.5.
• different types of organic reactions (Section 22.6).
Throughout this chapter, we will represent molecules by structural formulas, which 
show all the bonds present. Thus we have

22.1 Saturated Hydrocarbons: Alkanes
One large and structurally simple class of hydrocarbons includes those substances in 
which all the carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds. These are called saturated hydrocar-
bons, or alkanes. In the alkanes the carbon atoms are bonded to each other in chains, 
which may be long or short, straight or branched.
The ratio of hydrogen to carbon atoms is a maximum in alkanes, hence the term 
“saturated” hydrocarbon. The general formula of an alkane containing n carbon atoms is
CnH2n12
The simplest alkanes are those for which n 5 1 (CH4), n 5 2 (C2H6), or n 5 3 (C3H8):

Around the carbon atoms in these molecules, and indeed in any saturated hydro-
carbon, there are four single bonds involving sp3 hybrid orbitals. As would be expected 
from the VSEPR model, these bonds are directed toward the corners of a regular  
Carbon always follows the octet rule in 
stable compounds.
The outer surfaces of these molecules 
contain mainly H atoms.

tetrahedron. The bond angles are approximately 109.58, the tetrahedral angle. This 
means that in propane (C3H8) and in the higher alkanes, the carbon atoms are 
arranged in a “zigzag” pattern (Figure 22.1).
Two different alkanes are known with the molecular formula C4H10. In one of these, 
called butane, the four carbon atoms are linked in a “straight (unbranched) chain.” In the 
other, called 2-methylpropane, there is a “branched chain.” The longest chain in the mol-
ecule contains three carbon atoms; there is a CH3 branch from the central carbon atom. 
The geometries of these molecules are shown in Figure 22.2. The structures are

Compounds having the same molecular formula but different molecular structures 
are called structural isomers. Butane and 2-methylpropane are referred to as structural 
isomers of C4H10. They are two distinct compounds with their own characteristic physi-
cal and chemical properties.
In structural isomers, the atoms are 
bonded in different patterns; the skel-
etons are different.

strategy
1. Start by writing all five-­carbon atoms in a straight chain. Call this structure isomer (I).
2. Write a four-­carbon chain structure bonding the fifth carbon atom to one of the C atoms in the straight chain.
 
Note that bonding the fifth C atom to either end of the straight chain gives you isomer (I). You have to attach the C 
atom next to the terminal atom (on either end).
3. Write a three-­carbon chain. Do not attach the remaining two carbon atoms as a chain to either end of the three-­
carbon chain. You will get Isomer (I). Attaching one carbon atom to each end of the three-­carbon chain also gives  
you isomer (I).

22.1  saturated hydrocarbons: alkanes
Structural isomers have different properties. For example, the three isomers of 
C5H12 in Example 22.1 boil at different temperatures.

In general, long “skinny” isomers like I tend to have higher boiling points than highly 
branched isomers like III. Dispersion forces become weaker as chain branching increases. 
This principle is used in the seasonal blending of gasoline. A greater percentage of more 
volatile, highly branched alkanes is included in winter, making combustion occur more 
readily at lower temperatures.
Nomenclature
As organic chemistry developed, it became apparent that some systematic way of nam-
ing compounds was needed. About 80 years ago, the International Union of Pure and 
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) devised a system that is usable for all organic compounds. 
To illustrate this system, we will show how it works with alkanes.
For straight-chain alkanes such as
CH3 ! CH2 ! CH3        CH3 ! CH2 ! CH2 ! CH3

the name is more complex. A branched-chain alkane such as 2-methylpropane can be 
considered to be derived from a straight-chain alkane by replacing one or more hydro-
gen atoms by alkyl groups. The name consists of two parts:
•	 a suffix that identifies the parent straight-chain alkane. To find the suffix, count the 
number of carbon atoms in the longest continuous chain. For a three-carbon chain, 
the suffix is propane; for a four-carbon chain it is butane, and so on.
•	 a prefix that identifies the branching alkyl group (Table 22.1) and indicates by a num-
ber the carbon atom where branching occurs. In 2-methylpropane, referred to above, 
the methyl group is located at the second carbon from the end of the chain:
C19C29C3

Notice that
•	 if the same alkyl group is at two branches, the prefix di- is used (2,2-dimethylpro-
pane). If there were three methyl branches, we would write trimethyl, and so on.
•	 the number in the name is made as small as possible. Thus, we write 2-methylbutane, 
numbering the chain from the left

rather than from the right.

22.1  saturated hydrocarbons: alkanes
Sources and Uses of Alkanes
Natural gas, transmitted around the United States and Canada by pipeline, consists 
largely of methane (80%–90%), with smaller amounts of C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10. Cylin-
ders of “bottled gas,” used with campstoves, barbecue grills, and the like, contain liquid 
propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10) (Figure 22.3). The pressure remains constant as long 
as any liquid is present, then drops abruptly to zero, indicating that it’s time for a refill.
The higher alkanes are most often obtained from petroleum, a dark brown, viscous 
liquid dispersed through porous rock deposits. Distillation of petroleum gives a series of 
fractions of different boiling points (Figure 22.4, page 664). The most important of these is 
gasoline; distillation of a liter of petroleum gives about 250 mL of “straight-run” (with no 
chemical additives) gasoline. It is possible to double the yield of gasoline by converting 
higher- or lower-boiling fractions to hydrocarbons in the gasoline range (C5 to C12).
Gasoline-air mixtures tend to ignite prematurely, or “knock,” rather than burn 
smoothly. The octane number of a gasoline is a measure of its resistance to knock. It is 
determined by comparing the knocking characteristics of a gasoline sample with those 
of isooctane (the common name of one of the isomers of octane) and heptane:
CH39C9CH29C9CH3
CH3
CH3
CH3
H
isooctane
CH39CH29CH29CH29CH29CH29CH3
heptane
Isooctane, which is highly branched, burns smoothly with little knocking and is assigned 
an octane number of 100. Heptane, being unbranched, knocks badly. It is given an octane 
number of zero. Gasoline with the same knocking properties as a mixture of 90% isooc-
tane and 10% heptane is rated as “90 octane.”
To obtain premium gasoline of octane number above 80, it is necessary to use addi-
tives of one type or another. Until the mid-1970s, the principal antiknock agent was tet-
raethyllead, (C2H5)4Pb. Its use was phased out because it poisons catalytic converters 
and contaminates the environment with lead compounds. To replace tetraethyllead,  
oxygen-containing organic compounds such as ethanol, C2H5OH, are added to gasoline 
to promote smooth, complete combustion.
strategy
1. Find the longest carbon chain. That is the parent chain, which is written at the end (see Table 22.1).
2. Count the alkyl groups attached to the straight chain and identify them by referring to the right column of Table 22.1. 
Write the names of these alkyl groups before the name of the straight chain.
3. Number the carbon atoms from left to right to indicate the carbon atoms to which the alkyl groups are bonded.

chapter twenty-TWO  Organic Chemistry
Petroleum contains hydrocarbons other than the open-chain alkanes considered to 
this point. These include cycloalkanes in which 3 to 30 CH2 groups are bonded into 
closed rings. The structures of the two most common hydrocarbons of this type are 
shown in Figure 22.5. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane, where the bond angles are close to 
the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.58, are stable liquids with boiling points of 498C and 
818C, respectively.
Cycloalkanes, like alkanes, are saturated hydrocarbons containing only single 
bonds. Notice, though, that as a result of ring formation, each cycloalkane molecule 
contains two fewer hydrogen atoms than the corresponding alkane.

22.2  unsaturated hydrocarbons: alkenes and alkynes
22.2 Unsaturated Hydrocarbons: Alkenes 
and Alkynes
In an unsaturated hydrocarbon, at least one of the carbon-carbon bonds in the molecule 
is a multiple bond. As a result, there are fewer hydrogen atoms in an unsaturated hydro-
carbon than in a saturated one with the same number of carbons. We will consider two 
types of unsaturated hydrocarbons:
•	 alkenes, in which there is one carbon-carbon double bond in the molecule:
C"C
	
Replacing a single bond with a double bond eliminates two hydrogen atoms. Hence 
the general formula of an alkene is
CnH2n
	
as compared with CnH2n12 for an alkane.
•	 alkynes, in which there is one carbon-carbon triple bond in the molecule:
! C # C !
	
Again, two hydrogen atoms are “lost” when a double bond is converted to a triple 
bond. Hence the general formula of an alkyne is
CnH2n22

(a) the alkane, alkene, and alkyne containing six carbon atoms?

molecule is planar. There is no rotation about the double bond, since that would require 
“breaking” the pi bond. The bond angle in ethene is 1208, corresponding to sp2 hybridiza-
tion about each carbon atom. The geometries of ethene and the next member of the al-
kene series, C3H6, are shown in Figure 22.6.
Ethene is produced in larger amounts than any other organic chemical, about 
1.7 3 107 metric tons annually in the United States. It is made by heating ethane to about 
7008C in the presence of a catalyst.
C2H6(g) 9: C2H4(g) 1 H2(g)
Ethene is used to make a host of organic compounds; it is also the starting material for 
the preparation of polyethylene (Chapter 23). Since it is a plant hormone, ethene finds 
application in agriculture. It is used to ripen fruit that has been picked green to avoid 
spoilage in shipping. Exposure to ethene at very low concentrations produces the colors 
we associate with ripe bananas and oranges.
The names of alkenes are derived from those of the corresponding alkanes with the 
same number of carbon atoms per molecule. There are two modifications:

The most important alkyne by far is the first member of the series, commonly called 
acetylene. Recall from Chapter 7 that the C2H2 molecule is linear, with 1808 bond angles. 
The triple bond consists of a sigma bond and two pi bonds; each carbon atom is  
sp-hybridized. The geometries of acetylene and the next member of the series, C3H4, are 
shown in Figure 22.7.
Thermodynamically, acetylene is unstable with respect to decomposition to the 
elements:
C2H2(g) 9: 2C(s) 1 H2(g)        DG8 5 2209.2 kJ at 258C
At high pressures, this reaction can occur explosively. For that reason, cylinders of acety-
lene do not contain the pure gas. Instead the cylinder is packed with an inert, porous 
material that holds a solution of acetylene gas in acetone.
You are probably most familiar with acetylene as a gaseous fuel used in welding and 
cutting metals (Figure 22.8). When mixed with pure oxygen in a torch, acetylene burns 
at temperatures above 20008C. The heat comes from the reaction

22.3 Aromatic Hydrocarbons 
and Their Derivatives
Aromatic hydrocarbons, sometimes referred to as arenes, can be considered as deriva-
tives of benzene, C6H6. Benzene is a transparent, volatile liquid (bp 5 808C) that was 
discovered by Michael Faraday in 1825. Its formula, C6H6, suggests a high degree of un-
saturation, yet its properties are quite different from those of alkenes or alkynes.
As pointed out in Chapter 7, the atomic orbital (valence bond) model regards ben-
zene as a resonance hybrid of the two structures

668
 
chapter twenty-TWO  Organic Chemistry
In these “line-angle” formulas it is understood that there is a carbon atom at each vertex 
of the hexagon; hydrogen atoms are not shown. This model is consistent with many of 
the properties of benzene. The molecule is a planar hexagon with bond angles of 1208. 
The hybridization of each carbon is sp2. However, this structure is misleading in one re-
spect. Chemically, benzene does not behave as if double bonds were present.
A more satisfactory model of the electron distribution in benzene, based on mo-
lecular orbital theory (Appendix 4), assumes that
•	 each carbon atom forms three sigma bonds, one to a hydrogen atom and two to adja-
cent carbon atoms.
•	 the three electron pairs remaining are spread symmetrically over the entire molecule 
to form “delocalized” pi bonds.
This model is often represented by the structure
where it is understood that
•	 a carbon atom is at each corner of the hexagon.
•	 an H atom is bonded to each carbon atom.
•	 the circle in the center of the molecule represents the six delocalized electrons.
At one time, benzene was widely used as a solvent, both commercially and in research 
and teaching laboratories. That use has largely disappeared because of its toxicity. Chronic 
exposure to benzene vapor leads to various blood disorders and, in extreme cases, aplastic 
anemia and leukemia. It appears that the culprits are oxidation products of the aromatic 
ring, formed in an attempt to solubilize benzene and thus eliminate it from the body.
Derivatives of Benzene
Among the more common monosubstituted benzenes are the following:
benzoic
acid
C"O
O9H
aniline
NH2
toluene
CH3
phenol
OH
Phenol was the first commercial antiseptic; its introduction into hospitals in the 
1870s led to a dramatic decrease in deaths from postoperative infections. Its use for this 
purpose has long since been abandoned because phenol burns exposed tissue, but many 
modern antiseptics are phenol derivatives. Toluene has largely replaced benzene as a 
solvent because it is much less toxic. Oxidation of toluene in the body gives benzoic acid, 
which is readily eliminated and has none of the toxic properties of the oxidation prod-
ucts of benzene. Indeed, benzoic acid or its sodium salt (Na1, C6H5COO2 ions) is widely 
used as a preservative in foods and beverages, including fruit juices and soft drinks.
When there are two groups attached to the benzene ring, three isomers are possible. 
These are designated by the prefixes ortho-, meta-, and para-, often abbreviated as o-, m-, 
and p-.

group for a hydrogen atom. The functional group can be a nonmetal atom or a small 
group of atoms that is bonded to carbon. Table 22.2 lists the types of functional groups 
commonly found in organic compounds.
Alcohols and Ethers
The general structural formula of an alcohol is
R ! O ! H
where R is an alkyl group. Alcohols are named by substituting the suffix -ol for the -ane 
suffix of the corresponding alkane. For the first four alcohols we have (common names  
in red):
2-propanol
(isopropyl alcohol)

CH39CH9CH3
1-propanol
(propyl alcohol)

22.4  functional groups
Ethers have the general structure
R ! O ! R9
where the two alkyl groups can be the same (e.g., R 5 R9 5 CH3) or different (R 5 CH3; 
R9 5 C2H5). Ethers are ordinarily named by citing the two alkyl groups:
CH3 ! O ! CH3        CH3 ! O ! C2H5
	
dimethyl ether	
ethyl methyl ether
Table 22.3 compares two physical properties, boiling point and water solubility, of 
alcohols, ethers, and alkanes of similar molar masses. Notice that
•	 alcohols have boiling points much higher than those of alkanes of comparable molar 
mass. This reflects the fact that alcohol molecules, like H2O, are strongly hydrogen-
bonded to one another. Ethers cannot do this, since they do not contain OH groups, 
so they have boiling points much lower than those of comparable alcohols.
•	 alcohols and ethers of low molar mass are generally soluble in water. Ethers, like alco-
hols, can form hydrogen bonds with water, making use of the OH groups in the water 
molecule.
About 3 3 109 kg of methanol are produced annually in the United States from syn-
thesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen:
CO(g) 1 2H2(g) 9999: CH3OH(g)
	
ZnO,Cr2O3
250 atm, 3508C
Methanol is also formed as a byproduct when charcoal is made by heating wood in the 
absence of air. For this reason, it is sometimes called wood alcohol. Methanol is used in 
jet fuels and as a solvent, gasoline additive, and starting material for several industrial 
syntheses. It is a deadly poison; ingestion of as little as 25 mL can be fatal. The antidote 
in this case is a solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate, NaHCO3.
Ethanol, the most common alcohol, can be made by the fermentation of sugar (Fig-
ure 22.9, page 672) or grain—hence its common name “grain alcohol.” It is the active 
ingredient of alcoholic beverages, in which it is present at various concentrations (4%–
8% in beer, 12%–15% in wine, and 40% or more in distilled spirits). The “proof” of an 
alcoholic beverage is twice the volume percentage of ethanol; an 86-proof bourbon whis-
key contains 43% (by volume) ethanol. The flavor of alcoholic beverages is due to impu-
rities; ethanol itself is tasteless and colorless.
Industrial ethanol is made by the reaction of ethylene with water, using sulfuric acid 
as a catalyst.

Frequently, ethanol that is not destined for human consumption is “denatured” by add-
ing small quantities of methanol or benzene. This avoids the high federal tax on beverage 
alcohol; denatured alcohol is poisonous.
Certain alcohols contain two or more ! OH groups per molecule. Perhaps the most 
familiar compounds of this type are ethylene glycol and glycerol:

Ethylene glycol is widely used as an antifreeze. Glycerol is formed as a byproduct in mak-
ing soaps. It is a viscous, sweet-tasting liquid used in making drugs, antibiotics, plastics, 
and explosives (nitroglycerin).
The only ether that you are likely to encounter in the laboratory is diethyl ether, 
often referred to simply as “ether.” It was first used as an anesthetic in the 1840s. Today 
we use other compounds for that purpose, for at least a couple of reasons. For one 
thing, ether vapor is highly flammable. For another, liquid ether, on standing in con-
tact with air, tends to form compounds called hydroperoxides, which are potent 
explosives.

Acetone (bp 5 568C) is completely water-soluble and dissolves a wide variety of 
organic compounds as well. Accordingly, it is one of the most important industrial sol-
vents. You may be most familiar with it as the solvent in nail polish.
Normally, only small amounts of acetone are produced in the human body. Diabet-
ics produce larger amounts, sometimes enough to give their breath a sweet odor.
Formaldehyde (bp 5 2218C) is ordinarily found in the laboratory in the form of a 
concentrated water solution (37% HCHO) known as formalin. At one time it was widely 
used as a preservative for biological specimens. That application has declined now that 
formaldehyde has been shown to be carcinogenic. Industrially, it is still used as a compo-
nent of adhesives used in making plywood and fiberboard.
Formaldehyde, as a gas or in water solution, has a distinctly unpleasant odor. Higher 
“aromatic” aldehydes such as those shown in Figure 22.10 are a lot more pleasant to deal 
with; they are used in flavorings and even perfumes.

Carboxylic Acids and Esters
The general structure of a carboxylic acid is
O
R9C9OH
As usual, R is a hydrocarbon group or, in the simplest case, a hydrogen atom. The acidic 
hydrogen atom is the one bonded to oxygen. The IUPAC name of a carboxylic acid is 
obtained by substituting the suffix “-oic acid” for the final “e” in the name of the corre-
sponding alkane. In practice, such names are seldom used. For example, the first two 
members of the series are commonly referred to as formic acid and acetic acid.
methanoic acid
formic acid
H9C9OH
O
ethanoic acid
acetic acid
CH39C9OH
O
According to legend, formic acid used to be made by distilling ants (Latin, formica). 
Acetic acid is the active ingredient of vinegar, responsible for its sour taste. “White” vin-
egar is made by adding pure acetic acid to water, forming a 5% solution. “Brown” or 
“apple cider” vinegar is made from apple juice; the ethyl alcohol formed by fermentation 
is oxidized to acetic acid.
The most important property of carboxylic acids is implied by their name: they act 
as weak acids in water solution.
RCOOH(aq) EF H1(aq) 1 RCOO2(aq)
Carboxylic acids vary considerably in strength. Among the strongest is trichloroacetic 
acid (Ka 5 0.20); a 0.10 M solution of Cl3C ! COOH is about 73% ionized. Trichloro-
acetic acid is an ingredient of over-the-counter preparations used to treat canker sores 
and remove warts.
Treatment of a carboxylic acid with the strong base NaOH forms the sodium salt of 
the acid. With acetic acid, the acid-base reaction is
O
CH39C9OH (aq) + OH−(aq)

CH39C9O−(aq) + H2O

22.5 Isomerism in Organic Compounds
Isomers are distinctly different compounds, with different properties, that have the same 
molecular formula. In Section 22.1, we considered structural isomers of alkanes. You will 
recall that butane and 2-methylpropane have the same molecular formula, C4H10, but 
different structural formulas. In these, as in all structural isomers, the order in which the 
atoms are bonded to each other differs.
Structural isomerism is common among all types of organic compounds. For ex-
ample, there are:

22.5  isomerism in organic compounds
Geometric (cis-trans) Isomers
As we saw earlier, there are three structural isomers of the alkene C4H8. You may be 
surprised to learn that there are actually four different alkenes with this molecular for-
mula. The “extra” compound arises because of a phenomenon called geometric isomer-
ism. There are two different geometric isomers of the structure shown on the left, on 
page 678, under (1).

C

bp = 4°C

bp = 1°C

H

H
CH3
In the cis isomer, the two CH3 groups (or the two H atoms) are as close to one an-
other as possible. In the trans isomer, the two identical groups are farther apart. The two 
forms exist because there is no free rotation about the carbon-to-carbon double bond. 
The situation is analogous to that with cis-trans isomers of square planar complexes 
(Chapter 19). In both cases, the difference in geometry is responsible for isomerism; the 
atoms are bonded to each other in the same way.
Geometric, or cis-trans, isomerism is common among alkenes. It occurs when both 
of the double-bonded carbon atoms are joined to two different atoms or groups. The 
other two structural isomers of C4H8 shown under (1) on page 678 do not show cis-trans 
isomerism. In both cases the carbon atom at the left is joined to two identical hydrogen 
atoms.

22.5  isomerism in organic compounds
you can see from Figure 22.11, there are two different forms of this molecule, which are 
mirror images of one another. The mirror images are not superimposable; that is, you 
cannot place one molecule over the other so that identical groups are touching. In this 
sense, the two isomers resemble right and left hands (Figure 22.12).
There is another way to convince yourself that the two structures shown in Figure 
22.11 are different isomers. Imagine yourself directly above the hydrogen atom, looking 
down at the rest of the molecule. In the structure at the left, the atoms Cl, Br, I, in that 
order, are arranged in a clockwise pattern. With the structure at the right, in order to 
move from Cl to Br to I, you have to move counterclockwise.
A molecule such as CHClBrI, which exists in two different forms that are not super-
imposable mirror images, is said to be chiral. The two different forms are referred to as 
enantiomers, or optical isomers. Any molecule in which four different groups are 
bonded to carbon will be chiral; the carbon atom serves as a chiral center. Molecules 
may contain more than one chiral center, in which case there can be more than two 
enantiomers.

chapter twenty-TWO  Organic Chemistry
The term “optical isomerism” comes from the effect that enantiomers have on plane-
polarized light, such as that produced by a Polaroid lens (Figure 22.13). When this light 
is passed through a solution containing a single enantiomer, the plane is rotated from its 
original position. One isomer rotates it to the right (clockwise) and the other to the left 
(counterclockwise). If both isomers are present in equal amounts, we obtain what is 
known as a racemic mixture. In this case, the two rotations offset each other and there 
is no effect on plane-polarized light.
strategy
Look for carbon atoms that have four different atoms or groups bonded to them. As soon as you see two (or more) identical 
atoms or groups, you can stop counting. The C atom is not chiral.

22.6  organic reactions
Except for their effect on plane-polarized light, two enantiomers of a chiral com-
pound have identical physical properties. For example, the two isomers of lactic acid 
shown below have the same melting point, 528C, and density, 1.25 g/mL.

(II)
enantiomers of lactic acid
On the other hand, because enantiomers differ in their three-dimensional structure, 
they often interact with biochemical molecules in different ways. As a result, they may 
show quite different physiological properties. Consider, for example, amphetamine, of-
ten used illicitly as an “upper” or “pep pill.” Amphetamine consists of two enantiomers:

enantiomers of amphetamine
Enantiomer I, called Dexedrine, is by far the stronger stimulant. It is from two to four 
times as active as Benzedrine, the racemic mixture of the two isomers.
In the 1990s, a large number of so-called chiral drugs containing a single enantio-
mer came on the market. One of the first of these was naproxen (trade name Aleve®).
CH3O
C9COOH

H
(chiral carbon shown in color)
The naproxen that you buy over the counter at your local pharmacy consists of a single 
enantiomer, which is an effective analgesic (pain killer). The other enantiomer is not a 
pain killer; even worse, it can cause liver damage.
Of the 100 best-selling drugs on the market today, about half consist of a single en-
antiomer. Chiral drugs are used to treat all kinds of illnesses, from arthritis to asthma, 
from heartburn to heart disease. In general, these drugs are prepared by either of two 
different methods. One possibility is to resolve a racemic mixture into its components. 
This was first done in the mid-nineteenth century by Louis Pasteur (1822–1895). He used 
a magnifying glass and a pair of tweezers to separate crystals of enantiomers. Today reso-
lution can be accomplished much more quickly by using modern separation techniques 
such as liquid chromatography (Chapter 1).
A different approach to making chiral drugs is asymmetric synthesis. An optically 
inactive precursor is converted to the drug by a reaction that uses a special catalyst, usu-
ally an enzyme (Chapter 11). If all goes well, the product is a single enantiomer with the 
desired physiological effect. In 2001, William S. Knowles (1917–    ), Ryogi Noyori 
(1938–    ), and K. Barry Sharpless (1941–    ) won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work 
in this area.
22.6 Organic Reactions
The reactions that take place in organic chemistry differ in important ways from those 
discussed earlier in this text. In particular, the species taking part in organic reactions 
are most often molecules rather than ions. Again, most organic reactions take place be-
tween pure substances or in nonpolar solvents as opposed to water. Generally speaking, 
organic reactions occur more slowly than inorganic ones. In this section we will look at 
four general types of organic reactions known as addition, elimination, condensation, 
and substitution.
Ions tend to react fast.

chapter twenty-TWO  Organic Chemistry
Addition Reactions
In an addition reaction, a small molecule (e.g., H2, Cl2, HCl, H2O) adds across a double 
or triple bond. A simple example is the addition of hydrogen gas to ethene in the  
presence of a nickel catalyst.
H
H
Ni
H9C"C9H + H9H
H
H
H
H
H9C9C9H
With ethyne (acetylene), one or two moles of H2 may add, depending upon the catalyst 
and the conditions used.
Hydrogenation has found commercial application in the conversion of liquid to 
solid fats. Vegetable oils contain a relatively high proportion of double bonds. Treatment 
with hydrogen under pressure in the presence of a catalyst converts double bonds to 
single bonds and produces solids such as margarine.
As we saw earlier (Section 22.4), ethanol can be made from ethene by “adding” wa-
ter in the presence of an acid catalyst. This process is referred to as hydration:
C2H4(g) 1 H2O(l) 9: C2H5OH(l)
	
H1
Still another species that adds readily to ethene is elementary bromine (Figure 22.14):
H
Br
H
H
H
Br
H9C"C9H + Br9Br
H9C9C9H
Elimination and Condensation Reactions
An elimination reaction is, in a sense, the reverse of an addition reaction. It involves the 
elimination of two groups from adjacent carbon atoms, converting a saturated molecule 
into one that is unsaturated. An example is the dehydration of ethanol, which occurs 
when it is heated with sulfuric acid:
ethanol
ethene
H9C"C9H + H9OH
H
OH
H
H
H
H
H9C9C9H
This is, of course, the reverse of the addition reaction by which ethanol is formed.
A somewhat similar reaction, referred to as condensation, occurs when two mole-
cules combine by splitting out a small molecule such as H2O. The molecules that com-
bine may be the same or different:
CH3 ! OH 1 HO ! CH3 9: CH3 ! O ! CH3 1 H ! OH
	
methanol	
methanol	
dimethyl ether
acetic acid
methanol
methyl acetate
CH39OH  HO9C9CH3
CH39O9C9CH3  H9OH
O

The first reaction offers a general way of preparing ethers from alcohol. The second reac-
tion is that of esterification, referred to earlier.

At the left is a solution of bromine in 
carbon tetrachloride. Addition of a few 
drops of an alkene causes the red color 
to disappear as the alkene reacts with 
the bromine.
Double and triple bonds are much 
more reactive than single bonds.
The H2SO4 absorbs the H2O and drives 
the reaction to the right.

Substitution Reactions
A substitution reaction is one in which an atom or group of atoms in a molecule is re-
placed by a diff erent atom or group. Substitution reactions are very common in organic 
chemistry. Examples include the following:
• chlorination of alkanes. When a mixture of methane and chlorine gases is exposed to 
light, the following reaction occurs:
CH4(g) 1 Cl2(g) 9: CH3Cl(g) 1 HCl(g)
• A very similar reaction occurs with benzene:
C6H6(l) 1 Cl2(g) 99: C6H5Cl(l) 1 HCl(g)
FeCl3
• the nitration of benzene:
C6H6(l) 1 HNO3(l) 99: C6H5NO2(l) 1 H2O(l)
H2SO4
In this case the nitro group, NO2, substitutes for a hydrogen atom in the benzene 
ring.
• formation of an alcohol from an alkyl halide:
C2H5Br(l) 1 OH2(aq) 9: C2H5OH(aq) 1 Br2(aq)
Here a bromine atom is replaced by an ! OH group.
eXAMple 22.12
Classify each of the following as an addition, elimination, condensation, or substitution reaction.
(a) C2H5OH(aq) 1 H1(aq) 1 Br2(aq) 9: C2H5Br(l) 1 H2O
(b) C6H12(l) 1 Cl2(g) 9: C6H12Cl2(l)
(c) C7H8(l) 1 2Cl2(g) 9: C7H6Cl2(l) 1 2HCl(g)

(a) substitution (Br for OH)     (b)  addition (C6H12 is an alkene)
(c) substitution (Cl for H) 
(d)  elimination (HCl lost)
Cholesterol
An organic compound that we hear a great deal about nowadays is 
cholesterol, whose structure is shown in figure A (page 686). your 
body contains about 140 g of cholesterol; it is synthesized in the 
liver at the rate of 2 to 3 g/day. Cholesterol is essential to life for

two reasons. It is a major component of all cell membranes, and it 
serves as the starting material for the synthesis of sex hormones, 
adrenal hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D.
Cholesterol, which is water-insoluble, is transported through 
the blood in the form of soluble protein complexes known as lipo-

Fats and oils all contain a mixture of 
saturated, monounsaturated, and 
polyunsaturated fatty acids.
proteins. There are two types of 
complexes: low-density (LDL), 
which contain mostly cholesterol, 
and high-density (HDL), which 
contain relatively little choles-
terol. Commonly, these com-
plexes are referred to as “LDL 
cholesterol” and “HDL choles-
terol,” respectively.
LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol builds up as a plaque-like deposit on 
the interior walls of arteries. This process used to be called hard-
ening of the arteries; today it is referred to as atherosclerosis. It 
can lead to cardiovascular diseases, including strokes and heart 
attacks. In contrast, HDL or “good” cholesterol retards or even 
reduces arterial deposits.
The relative amounts of LDL and HDL cholesterol in your 
bloodstream depend, at least in part, on your diet. In particular, 
they depend on the total amount and the type of fat that you eat. 
Fats (triglycerides) are esters of glycerol with long-chain carbox-
ylic acids. The general structure of a fat can be represented as
H

where R, R9, and R0, are hydrocarbon residues typically containing 
13 to 21 carbon atoms. Depending on the nature of these residues, 
we can distinguish among—
•	 saturated fats, in which R, R9, and R0 contain no multiple bonds. 
These are “bad” in the sense that they lead to high levels of LDL 
relative to HDL cholesterol.
•	 monounsaturated fats, in which each residue contains one 
double bond. These are much better nutritionally unless, God 
forbid, the hydrogen atoms on opposite sides of the double 
bonds are trans to one another. So-called trans fats are bad 
news.
•	 polyunsaturated fats, in which the hydrocarbon residues contain 
more than one double bond, are good guys, particularly if a 
double bond is located on the third or sixth carbon atom from 
the ! CH3 end of the residue. These so-called omega fats are 
the best of all.
Figure B shows the composition of various fats (solids) and oils 
(liquids). Now you know why sunflower seeds are better for you 
than coconuts.

n previous chapters we have discussed the chemical and physical properties of many 
kinds of substances. For the most part, these materials were made up of either small 
molecules or simple ions. In this chapter, we will be concerned with an important class of 
compounds containing large molecules. We call these compounds polymers.
A large number of small molecular units, called monomers, combined together chem-
ically make up a polymer. A typical polymer molecule contains a chain of monomers several 
thousand units long. The monomer units that comprise a given polymer may be the same or 
different.
We start with synthetic organic polymers. Since about 1930, a variety of synthetic 
polymers have been made available by the chemical industry. The monomer units are joined 
together either by addition (Section 23.1) or by condensation (Section 23.2). They are used 
to make cups, plates, fabrics, automobile tires, and even artificial hearts.
The remainder of this chapter deals with natural polymers. These are large molecules, 
produced by plants and animals, that carry out the many life-sustaining processes in a living 
cell. The cell membranes of plants and the woody structure of trees are composed in large 
part of cellulose, a polymeric carbohydrate. We will look at the structures of a variety of 
different carbohydrates in Section 23.3. Another class of natural polymers are the proteins. 
No single thing abides; but all things 
flow 
Fragment to fragment clings—the 
things thus grow 
Until we know and name them. By 
degrees 
They melt, and are no more the things 
we know.
—Titus Lucretius Carus (92–52 b.c.)

and even hair.
23.1 Synthetic Addition Polymers
When monomer units add directly to one another, the result is an addition polymer. 
Table 23.1 lists some of the more familiar synthetic addition polymers. You will notice 
that each of these is derived from a monomer containing a carbon-carbon double bond. 
Upon polymerization, the double bond is converted to a single bond:

and successive monomer units add to one another.

monomer ethylene. We might represent the polymerization process as

Neighboring chains in linear polyethylene line up nearly parallel to each other. This 
gives a polymer that approaches a crystalline material. It is used for bottles, toys, and 
other semirigid objects.
The two forms of polyethylene differ slightly in density. Linear polyethylene is re-
ferred to in the recycling business as high-density polyethylene, represented by the sym-
bol “HDPE #2” on the bottom of a plastic bottle. The corresponding symbol for branched 
polyethylene is “LDPE #4,” indicating low-density polyethylene. (The smaller the num-
ber, the easier it is to recycle.)

Teflon
Teflon (C2F2)n, where n is of the order of 104 to 105, is a versatile but expensive polymer 
($10–20/kg). It is virtually impervious to chemical attack, even at high temperatures. 
Apparently the fluorine atoms form a protective shield around the central carbon chain:

For much the same reason, Teflon is essentially invulnerable to attack by aqueous or or-
ganic solvents. Beyond that, Teflon is an excellent electrical insulator. Indeed, its largest 
industrial use is in that area.
You are probably most familiar with Teflon as a nonstick coating for kitchen utensils 
(Figure 23.2). The slippery surface of Teflon-coated fry pans and muffin tins results from 
Teflon’s extremely low coefficient of friction.
23.2 Synthetic Condensation Polymers
As we pointed out in Chapter 22, a condensation reaction is one in which two molecules 
combine by splitting out a small molecule such as water. The reaction of an alcohol, 
ROH, or an amine, RNH2, with a carboxylic acid R9COOH is a condensation:

chapter TWenty-three  Organic Polymers, Natural and Synthetic
Condensation polymers are formed in a similar way; the molecule split out is most 
often water. In order to produce a condensation polymer, the monomers involved must 
have functional groups at both ends of the molecule. Most often these groups are
! NH2        ! OH        ! COOH
The products formed are referred to as polyesters and polyamides.
Polyesters
Consider what happens when an alcohol with two ! OH groups, HO ! R ! OH, reacts 
with a dicarboxylic acid, HOOC ! R9 ! COOH. In this case the ester formed still has a 
reactive group at both ends of the molecule.

The COOH group at one end of the ester molecule can react with another alcohol mol-

continue, leading eventually to a long-chain polymer containing 500 or more ester 
groups. The general structure of the polyester can be represented as

Perhaps the most important polyester is poly(ethylene terephthalate), commonly 
known as PET (or “PETE 1” on plastic beverage bottles). The annual production of PET 
in the United States is of the order of 108 kg (105 metric tons). Much of this is converted 
into fabric (trade name, Dacron) or magnetically coated film (Mylar).

Polyamides
When a diamine (molecule containing two NH2 groups) reacts with a dicarboxylic acid 
(two COOH groups), a polyamide is formed. This condensation polymerization is en-
tirely analogous to that used to make polyesters. In this case, the NH2 group of the di-
amine reacts with the COOH group of the dicarboxylic acid:

The polymer in Example 23.4 is “Nylon-66” (the numbers indicate the number of 
carbon atoms in the diamine and dicarboxylic acid molecules). This polymer was first 
made in 1935 by Wallace Carothers (1896–1937) working at DuPont (Figure 23.3, page 
698). Since then, other nylons, all polyamides, have been synthesized.
The elasticity of nylon fibers is due in part to hydrogen bonds between adjacent 
polymer chains. These hydrogen bonds join carbonyl oxygen atoms on one chain to NH 
groups on adjacent chains (Figure 23.4, page 698).

23.3 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates, which comprise one of the three basic classes of foodstuffs, contain car-
bon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Their general formula, Cn(H2O)m, is the basis for 
their name. They can be classified as
	 1.	 Monosaccharides, which cannot be broken down chemically to simpler carbohy-
drates. The most familiar monosaccharides contain either six carbon atoms per 
molecule (glucose, fructose, galactose, .  .  .) or five (ribose, arabinose, .  .  .).
	 2. Disaccharides, which are dimers formed when two monosaccharide units combine 
with the elimination of H2O. The monosaccharides may be the same (two glucose 
units in maltose) or different (a glucose and fructose unit in sucrose).

the reaction between hexamethylenediamine,

between the two reagents.

23.3  carbohydrates
	 3. Polysaccharides, which are condensation polymers containing from several hun-
dred to several thousand monosaccharide units. Cellulose and starch are the most 
common polysaccharides.
Glucose
By far the most important monosaccharide is glucose. As a pure solid, it has the “straight-
chain” structure shown in the margin. In water solution, glucose exists primarily as six-
membered ring molecules, shown below. The rings are not planar but have a three-
dimensional “chair” form. The carbon atoms at each corner of the ring are not shown in 
the structure; they are represented by the numbers 1 to 5. The sixth atom in the ring is 
oxygen. There is a CH2OH group bonded to carbon atom 5. There is an H atom bonded 
to each of the ring carbons; an OH group is bonded to carbon atoms 1 through 4. The 
heavy lines indicate the front of the ring, projected toward you.
The bonds to the H and OH groups from the ring carbons are oriented either in the 
plane of the ring (equatorial, shown in blue) or perpendicular to it (axial). In b-glucose, 
all four OH groups are equatorial. This keeps these rather bulky groups out of each oth-
er’s way. In a-glucose, the OH group on carbon atom 1 is axial; all the others are equato-
rial. In water solution, glucose exists as an equilibrium mixture, about 37% in the alpha 
form and 63% in the beta form; the straight-chain structure accounts for less than 0.1% 
of the dissolved glucose.

As you can see from their structures, a- and b-glucose have several chiral carbon atoms. 
Both isomers are optically active; they are not enantiomers (mirror images of one an-
other) because they differ in configuration only at carbon atom 1. As it happens, both 
a- and b-glucose rotate the plane of polarized light to the right (clockwise).

chapter TWenty-three  Organic Polymers, Natural and Synthetic
Glucose is also called “blood sugar.” It is absorbed readily into the bloodstream and 
is normally found there at concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 0.008 mol/L. If the 
concentration of glucose drops below 0.003 M, a condition called hypoglycemia is cre-
ated, with symptoms ranging from nervousness to loss of consciousness. If the glucose 
level rises above 0.01 M, as can easily happen with diabetics, it is excreted in the urine.
Although glucose can exist as a simple sugar, it is most often found in nature in 
combined form, as a disaccharide or polysaccharide. Several glucose-containing disac-
charides are known. We will consider two of these, maltose and sucrose.
Maltose and Sucrose
Maltose, a decomposition product of starch, is a dimer of two glucose molecules. These 
are combined head-to-tail; carbon atom 1 of one molecule is joined through an oxygen 
atom to carbon atom 4 of the second molecule. To form maltose, the two OH groups on 
these carbon atoms react, condensing out H2O and leaving the O atom bridge.

This reaction can be reversed either by using the enzyme maltase as a catalyst or by heat-
ing with acid. Two molecules of glucose are formed when this happens.
Sucrose, the compound we call “sugar,” is the most common disaccharide. One of 
the monomer units in sucrose is a-glucose. The other is fructose, a monosaccharide 
found in honey and natural fruit juices.

In the body, this reaction is reversed by the enzyme sucrase. This occurs in digestion, 
which makes glucose and fructose available for absorption into the blood. Honey bees 
also carry an enzyme that can hydrolyze sucrose. Honey consists mostly of a 1:1 mol 
mixture of glucose and fructose with a small amount of unreacted sucrose.

Another common disaccharide is lactose, the sugar found in milk. Lactose is a dimer of glucose and galactose, a monosac-
charide that is identical to glucose except that the positions of the H and OH groups at carbon atom 4 are switched.

Table 23.2 gives the relative sweetness of the mono- and disaccharides considered 
here, along with sucrose substitutes.
Starch
Starch is a polysaccharide found in many plants, where it is stored in roots and seeds. It 
is particularly abundant in corn and potatoes, the major sources of commercial starch. 
Perhaps as much as 50% of our food energy comes from starch, mostly in the form of 
wheat products.
Starch is actually a mixture of two types of a-glucose polymers. One of these, called 
amylose, is insoluble in water and comprises about 20% of natural starch. It consists of 
long single chains of 1000 or more a-glucose units joined head-to-tail (Figure 23.5, page 
702). The other glucose polymer found in starch is amylopectin, which is soluble in wa-
ter. The linkage between a-glucose units is the same as in amylose. However, amylopec-
tin has a highly branched structure. Short chains of 20 to 25 glucose units are linked 
through oxygen atom bridges. The oxygen atom joins a number 1 carbon atom at the end 
of one chain to a number 6 carbon atom on an adjacent chain.
When you eat “starchy” foods, they are broken down into glucose by enzymes. The 
process starts in your mouth with the enzyme amylase found in saliva. This explains why,

if you chew a piece of bread long enough, it starts to taste sweet. The breakdown of starch 
molecules continues in other parts of the digestive system. Within 1 to 4 hours after eat-
ing, all the starch in food is converted into glucose.
Cellulose
Cellulose contains long, unbranched chains of glucose units, about 10,000 per chain. It 
differs from starch in the way the glucose units are joined to each other. In starch, the 
oxygen bridge between the units is in the alpha position, as shown in Figure 23.5. In 
cellulose, it is in the beta position (Figure 23.6). Because humans lack the enzymes 
required to catalyze the hydrolysis of beta linkages, we cannot digest cellulose. The 
cellulose that we take in from fruits and vegetables remains undigested as “fiber.” Ru-
minants, like cows and deer, and termites have bacteria in their intestines capable of 
breaking cellulose down into glucose.
The molecular structure of cellulose, unlike that of starch, allows for strong hydro-
gen bonding between polymer chains. This results in the formation of strong water- 
resistant fibers such as those found in cotton, which is 98% cellulose. Cotton actually has 
a tensile strength greater than that of steel. The major industrial source of cellulose is 
wood (,50% cellulose).
23.4 Proteins
The natural polymers known as proteins make up about 15% by mass of our bodies. They 
serve many functions. Fibrous proteins are the main components of hair, muscle, and 
skin. Other proteins found in body fluids transport oxygen, fats, and other substances 
needed for metabolism. Still others, such as insulin and vasopressin, are hormones. En-
zymes, which catalyze reactions in the body, are chiefly protein.

23.4  proteins
Protein is an important component of most foods. Nearly everything we eat con-
tains at least a small amount of protein. Lean meats and vegetables such as peas and 
beans are particularly rich in protein. In our digestive system, proteins are broken down 
into small molecules called a-amino acids. These molecules can then be reassembled in 
cells to form other proteins required by the body.
a-Amino Acids
The monomers from which proteins are derived have the general structure shown below. 
These compounds are called a-amino acids. They have an NH2 group attached to the 
carbon atom (the a carbon) adjacent to a COOH group.
-amino acid
H
NH2
R9C9C
O
OH
The 20 a-amino acids shown in Table 23.3 are those most commonly found in natu-
ral proteins. They differ from one another in the nature of the R group attached to the 
alpha carbon. As you can see, R can be
•	 a H atom (glycine).
•	 a simple hydrocarbon group (alanine, valine, .  .  .).
•	 a more complex group containing one or more atoms of oxygen (serine, aspartic 
acid, etc.), nitrogen (lysine, etc.), or sulfur (methionine, etc.).
Proteins are condensation polymers of  
a-amino acids.
example 23.7
Consider the structures shown in Table 23.3.
(a) How many a-amino acids contain only one chiral carbon atom?
(b) How many contain only one ! NH2 group?
SOLUTION
(a) 17; the exceptions are glycine (0), isoleucine (2), and threonine (2).
(b) 17; the exceptions are proline (0), lysine (2), and glutamine (2).
In all the amino acids shown in Table 23.3 except glycine, the a-carbon is chiral. 
This means that these compounds are optically active. With alanine, for example, there 
should be two optical isomers:
COOH
CH3
NH2
C
H
COOH
CH3
NH2
H
C
Of the 20 common amino acids, ten are “essential” in the sense that they are 
required by humans for protein construction and cannot be synthesized in the body. 
These are designated by an asterisk in Table 23.3. Clearly the proteins we eat should 
contain these essential amino acids. Beyond that, a “high-quality” protein contains 
the various amino acids in the approximate ratio required by the body for protein 
synthesis. Generally speaking, animal proteins are of higher quality than plant pro-
teins, with eggs at the head of the class. This is something to keep in mind if you’re 
a vegetarian.

Acid-Base Properties of Amino Acids
You may recall from Example 22.8 that the reaction
CH3COOH(aq) 1 CH3NH2(aq) !: CH3COO2(aq) 1 CH3NH31(aq)
in which there is a proton transfer from a ! COOH group to an ! NH2 group has a 
large equilibrium constant, 7 3 105. In other words, this reaction goes virtually to com-
pletion when solutions of acetic acid and methylamine are mixed.

Here, too, the equilibrium constant is large and the reaction goes essentially to comple-

23.3, either in water solution or in the solid state. Instead it occurs as a zwitterion, which 
behaves like a polar molecule. Within it, there is a 11 charge on the nitrogen atom and a 
21 charge at one of the oxygen atoms of the COOH group. Overall, the zwitterion has no 
net charge.
In water, zwitterions are stable only over a certain pH range. At low pH (high H1 
concentration), the COO2 group picks up a proton. The product, shown at the left be-
low, has a 11 charge. At high pH (low H1 concentration), the NH31 group loses a pro-
ton. The species formed, shown at the right below, has a 21 charge.

In a very real sense, a zwitterion is analogous to a species such as the HCO32 ion, which 
accepts a proton at low pH and donates a proton at high pH:

Both the zwitterion and the HCO32 ion are amphiprotic, capable of acting as either a 
Brønsted acid or a Brønsted base.
To treat acid-base equilibria involving zwitterions, it is convenient to consider the 
cation stable at low pH to be a diprotic acid (analogous to H2CO3), which ionizes in two 
steps. Using the symbols C1, Z, and A2 to stand for the cation, zwitterion, and anion, 
respectively, we have

From Example 23.8 or Figure 23.7 (page 707), it is clear that the zwitterion of glycine 
is the principal species over a wide pH range, certainly from pH 3 to pH 9. The maxi-
mum concentration of zwitterion occurs at about pH 6; this is referred to as the isoelec-
tric point of glycine. At this pH, glycine does not migrate in an electric field, since the 
zwitterion is a neutral species. At low pH, the cation moves to the cathode; at high pH 
the anion migrates to the anode. In general, for an amino acid like glycine, where there 
is only one ! COOH group and one ! NH2 group:

Polypeptides
As noted in Section 23.2, molecules containing NH2 and COOH groups can undergo 
condensation polymerization. Amino acids contain both groups in the same molecule. 
Hence, two amino acid molecules can combine by the reaction of the COOH group in 
one molecule with the NH2 group of the other molecule. If the acids involved are differ-
ent, two different structural isomers are possible:

The dipeptide formed in Example 23.9 has a reactive group at both ends of the molecule 
(NH2 at one end, COOH at the other). Hence it can combine further to give tripeptides (three 
amino acid units), tetrapeptides, .  .  . , and eventually long-chain polymers called polypep-
tides. Proteins are polypeptides containing a large number of amino acid units:

Proteins differ from the other polymers we have discussed in that they may contain 
up to 20 different monomer units. This means that there are a huge number of possible 
proteins. Using the amino acids listed in Table 23.3, we could make
	 	 20 3 20 5 400 different dipeptides.
  20 3 20 3 20 5 8000 different tripeptides.
	 	 20n polypeptides containing n monomer units.
For a relatively simple protein containing only 50 monomer units, we have
	 	 2050 5 1 3 1065 possibilities.
Proteins; Primary Structure
To determine the primary structure of a protein that may contain a hundred or more 
amino acid units, it is necessary to
	 1.	 identify the amino acids present.
 2. determine the relative amounts of each amino acid.
	 3.	 establish the sequence of amino acid units in the protein.
Tasks (1) and (2) are relatively easy to accomplish. The sample is first heated with 
hydrochloric acid to break all of the “peptide linkages” (amide bonds) in the protein. The 
resulting solution is then passed through a chromatographic column (recall the discus-
sion in Chapter 1). This separates the different amino acids and allows you to determine 
their identities and concentrations.
Task (3) is more difficult. It uses a series of reagents each of which is capable of 
breaking only certain amide bonds. One of these reagents is the enzyme trypsin, which 
breaks only those bonds formed by the carboxyl groups in arginine and lysine. It would 
break the polypeptide
Ala-Gly-Ser-Lys-Gly-Leu-Arg-Met
into three fragments:
Ala-Gly-Ser-Lys;    Gly-Leu-Arg;    Met
Remember that, by convention, the NH2 group of each amino acid is written at the 
left; the COOH group is at the right. Other reagents split the chain at different points. By 
correlating the results of different hydrolysis experiments, it is possible to deduce the 
primary structure of the protein (or polypeptide). Example 23.10 shows how this is done 
in a particularly simple case.

serine.

In the body, proteins are built up by a series of reactions that in general produce a 
specific sequence of amino acids. Even tiny errors in this sequence may have serious ef-
fects. Among the genetic diseases known to be caused by improper sequencing are he-
mophilia, sickle cell anemia, and albinism. Sickle cell anemia is caused by the substitu-
tion of one valine unit for a glutamic acid unit in 
a chain containing 146 monomers.
Proteins; Secondary and 
Tertiary Structures
Protein chains (Figure 23.8) can align themselves 
so that certain patterns are repeated. These repeat-
ing patterns establish what we call the secondary 
structure of the protein. The nature of the pattern 
is determined in large part by hydrogen bonding. 
Oxygen atoms on C " O groups can interact with 
H atoms in nearby N ! H groups to form these 
bonds. This can occur within a single protein 
chain or between neighboring chains.
A common secondary structure is an a-helix, 
which maximizes hydrogen bonding between pep-
tide linkages. At the left of Figure 23.8 is the outline 
of the protein chain forming the helix. The more 
complete structure is given at the right. This shows 
where the hydrogen bonds form between amino 
acid units in the protein chain. Notice that the 
bulky R groups are all on the outside of the helix, 
where they have the most room. The actual struc-
ture of the helix is nearly independent of the nature

of the R groups. Th e dimensions of the helix correspond closely to those observed in such 
fi brous proteins as wool, hair, skin, feathers, and fi ngernails.
Th e three-dimensional conformation of a protein is called its tertiary structure. An 
a-helix can be either twisted, folded, or folded and twisted into a defi nite geometric pat-
tern. Th ese structures are stabilized by dispersion forces, hydrogen bonding, and other 
intermolecular forces.

made up of twisted a-helices. Th ree polypeptide chains, each of which is a left -handed 
helix, are twisted into a right-handed super helix to form an extremely strong tertiary 
structure. It has remarkable tensile strength, which makes it important in the structure 
of bones, tendons, teeth, and cartilage.
This is a rather special kind of H bond.
DNA Fingerprinting
Within every living cell, there is an organic natural polymer called 
deoxyribonucleic acid or, more commonly, dNA. The dNA mole-
cule is enormous; its molar mass is estimated to be of the order of 
2 3 1010 g. The molecule takes the form of a narrow, tightly coiled 
band, which, if straightened out, would have a length of about 1 m.
Figure A shows the primary structure of the dNA molecule. 
Notice that
• the backbone of the molecule consists of alternating units 
derived from phosphoric acid, H3PO4, and a 5-carbon sugar 
called deoxyribose.
• bonded to each sugar is a nitrogen base (amine). The base may 
be thymine (shown at the top in orange), adenine (red), guanine 
(blue), or cytosine (green). These are often abbreviated as the 
letters T, A, G, and c, respectively
• the structural unit of dNA, repeated over and over along the 
chain, is built from an H3PO4 molecule, a sugar molecule, and a 
nitrogen base, which may be any one of the four shown. Figure 
A shows four such structural units called nucleotides; an actual 
molecule of dNA would contain literally billions of such 
nucleotides.
The secondary structure of dNA is shown in Figure B (page 
711). This “double helix” model was fi rst proposed in 1953 by James 
Watson (1928–  ) and Francis crick (1916–2004), who used the 
x-ray crystallographic data of rosalind Franklin (1920–1958) and 
Maurice Wilkins (1916–2004). Beyond that, they were intrigued by 
the results of analyses that showed that in dNA the ratio of adenine 
to thymine molecules is almost exactly 11, as is the ratio of cyto-
sine to guanine:
A/T 5 c/G 5 1.00
This behavior is readily explained by the double helix; an A mole-
cule in one strand is always hydrogen-bonded to a T molecule in 
the second strand. Similarly, a c molecule in one strand is situated 
properly to form a hydrogen bond with a G molecule in the other 
strand. In 1962, Watson, crick, and Wilkins received the Nobel 
Prize in medicine.

  key concepts
The double helix model provides a simple explanation for cell 
division and reproduction. In the reproduction process, the two 
DNA chains unwind from each other. As this happens, a new 
matching chain of DNA is synthesized on each of the original ones, 
creating two double helices. Since the base pairs in each new 
double helix must match in the same way as in the original, the two 
new double helices must be identical to the original. Exact replica-
tion of genetic data is thereby accomplished, however complex 
that data may be.
The many millions of DNA molecules in the cells of your body 
are identical to each other. That is, the base sequence in all of 
these molecules is the same. In contrast, the base sequence of the 
DNA molecules in every other person in the world differs at least 
slightly from yours. In that sense, your “DNA fingerprint” is unique.
Alec Jeffreys (1950–  ), an English geneticist, discovered in 
the 1980s how to apply this principle to forensics. To do this, it is 
necessary to locate that portion of the DNA molecule in which the 
base sequence differs significantly from one individual to another. 
That part of the molecule is cut out by a “restrictive enzyme” in 
much the same way that trypsin splits a protein molecule into frag-
ments. The DNA sample obtained in this way from a suspect can 
be compared with that derived from blood, hair, semen, saliva, and 
so on, found at the scene of a violent crime.
At least in principle, comparison of DNA fingerprints can deter-
mine the guilt or innocence of a suspect beyond a reasonable 
doubt. If the two fingerprints differ, the suspect is innocent. Con-
versely, if the fingerprints match perfectly, the odds that the 
suspect is guilty are about 80 billion to one.
In practice, the situation isn’t quite that simple. DNA samples 
taken from a victim are almost certain to be contaminated with 
DNA from fungi or bacteria. Certain dyes can combine with restric-
tion enzymes, causing them to cut in the wrong places. Finally, 
DNA may decay in a warm or moist environment.
A DNA fingerprint can be used for many purposes other than 
solving violent crimes. In particular, it can serve to identify de-
ceased individuals. In June of 1998 the “Vietnam Unknown” buried 
in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Ceme-
tery was identified by DNA technology. He was shown to be First 
Lieutenant Michael Blassie, shot down over Vietnam in May of 
1972. DNA samples taken from his mother matched those ob-
tained from his body. A month later Blassie, a native of St. Louis, 
Missouri, was reburied in a national cemetery located in that city.

pairs adenine-thymine and cystosine-guanine that hold the strands

SI Units
As pointed out in Chapter 1, most quantities are commonly expressed in a variety of dif-
ferent units. For example, temperature can be reported in 8F, 8C, or K. Volume is some-
times quoted in liters or cubic centimeters, at other times in quarts, cubic feet, and so on. 
In 1960, the General Conference of Weights and Measures attempted to end this prolif-
eration of units. It recommended adopting a self-consistent set of units based on the 
metric system. In the so-called International System of Units (SI) each quantity is repre-
sented by a single unit or decimal multiple thereof, using the prefixes listed in Table 1.2. 
For example, the fundamental SI unit of length is the meter; the length of an object can 
be expressed in meters, kilometers (1 km 5 103 m), or nanometers (1 nm 5 1029 m), but 
not in inches, angstroms, or other non-SI units.
Table 1 lists the SI base and derived units for quantities commonly referred to in 
general chemistry. Perhaps the least familiar of these units to the beginning chemistry 
student are the ones used to represent force, pressure, and energy.
The newton is defined as the force required to impart an acceleration of one meter 
per second squared to a mass of one kilogram. Recall that Newton’s second law can be 
stated as
force 5 mass 3 acceleration
The pascal is defined as the pressure exerted by a force of one newton acting on an 
area of one square meter (recall that pressure 5 force/area).
The joule is defined as the work done when a force of one newton (kg · m/s2) acts 
through a distance of one meter (recall that work 5 force 3 distance).
Over the past 40 years, the International System of Units has met with a decidedly 
mixed reception, at least in the United States. On the one hand, scientists have adopted 
the joule as the base unit of energy, replacing the calorie. On the other hand, volumes are 
seldom if ever expressed in m3. The cubic meter is simply too large a unit; the medium-
sized test tube used in the general chemistry laboratory has a volume of about 0.00001 m3. 
The density of water is commonly expressed as 1.00 g/cm3, not as
1.00 g
cm3 3
1 kg
103 g 3
1102 cm2 3
1 m3
 5 1.00 3 103 kg/m3
(A cubic meter of water weighs about one metric ton!)

The mathematics you will use in general chemistry is relatively simple. You will, how-
ever, be expected to
•	 make calculations involving exponential numbers, such as 6.022 3 1023 or 1.6 3 10210.
•	 work with logarithms or inverse logarithms, particularly in problems involving pH:
pH 5 2log10 (conc. H1)
This appendix reviews each of these topics.
Exponential Notation
Chemists deal frequently with very large or very small numbers. In one gram of the ele-
ment carbon there are
50,140,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of carbon
At the opposite extreme, the mass of a single atom is
0.00000000000000000000001994 g
Numbers such as these are very awkward to work with. For example, neither of the 
numbers just written could be entered directly on a calculator. Operations involving very 
large or very small numbers can be simplified by using exponential (scientific) nota-
tion. To express a number in exponential notation, write it in the form
C 3 10n
where C is a number between 1 and 10 (for example, 1, 2.62, 5.8) and n is a positive or 
negative integer such as 1, 21, 23. To find n, count the number of places that the decimal 
point must be moved to give the coefficient, C. If the decimal point must be moved to the 
left, n is a positive integer; if it must be moved to the right, n is a negative integer. Thus
	
26.23 5 2.623 3 101	
(decimal point moved 1 place to left)
	
5609 5 5.609 3 103	
(decimal point moved 3 places to left)
0.0918 5 9.18 3 1022        (decimal point moved 2 places to right)
Multiplication and Division
A major advantage of exponential notation is that it simplifies the processes of multipli-
cation and division. To multiply, add exponents:
101 3 102 5 10112 5 103        106 3 1024 5 1061(24) 5 102
To divide, subtract exponents:
103/102 5 10322 5 101        1023/106 5 102326 5 1029
It often happens that multiplication or division yields an answer that is not in stan-
dard exponential notation. For example,
(5.0 3 104) 3 (6.0 3 103) 5 (5.0 3 6.0) 3 104 3 103 5 30 3 107
The product is not in standard exponential notation because the coefficient, 30, does 
not lie between 1 and 10. To correct this situation, rewrite the coefficient as 3.0 3 101 and 
then add exponents:
30 3 107 5 (3.0 3 101) 3 107 5 3.0 3 108
In another case,
0.526 3 103 5 (5.26 3 1021) 3 103 5 5.26 3 102

Exponential Notation on the Calculator
On all scientific calculators it is possible to enter numbers in exponential notation. The 
method used depends on the brand of calculator. Most often, it involves using a key la-
beled EXP , EE , or EEX . Check your instruction manual for the procedure to be followed. 
To make sure you understand it, try entering the following numbers:
2.4 3 106        3.16 3 1028        6.2 3 10216
Multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction can be carried out directly on 
your calculator. Try the following exercises:
(a)	(6.0 3 102) 3 (4.2 3 1024) 5 ?
(b)	 6.0 3 102
4.2 3 1024 5 ?
(c)	 3.6 3 1024 1 4 3 1025 5 ?
(d)	3.6 3 1024 2 4 3 1025 5 ?
The answers, expressed in exponential notation and following the rules of significant 
figures, are (a) 2.5 3 1021 (b) 1.4 3 106 (c) 4.0 3 1024 (d) 3.2 3 1024.
Exponential (or ordinary) numbers are readily raised to powers using a calculator. 
To square a number, use the x2 key. For example,
(3 3 104)2 5 9 3 108
For other powers, use the yx key. To cube a number, y, enter that number, press the yx 
key, enter 3, and read the answer. That way, you should find that
(2 3 1025)3 5 8 3 10215
Roots of exponentials are obtained in a similar way. To extract a square root, use the 
!x key. For other roots, use the yx key. To obtain a cube root, enter the number, press 
the yx key, enter 1/3 (0.333333333) and read the answer:
(2.0 3 1025)1/3 5 2.7 3 1022
(Many calculators have a
x!y   key, in which case, enter x 5 3 rather than 1/3.)
Try the following operations on your calculator.

Logarithms and Inverse Logarithms
The logarithm of a number n to the base m is defined as the power to which m must be 
raised to give the number n. Thus
if mx 5 n, then logm n 5 x
In other words, a logarithm is an exponent, which may be a whole number (e.g., 1, 21) 
but more often is not (e.g., 1.500, 20.301).
In general chemistry, you will encounter two kinds of logarithms.
1.  Common logarithms, where the base is 10, ordinarily denoted as log10. If 10x 5 n, 
then log10 n 5 x. Examples include the following:
	
log10 100 5 2.00	
(102 5 100)
	
log10 1 5 0.000	
(100 5 1)

2.  Natural logarithms, where the base is the quantity e 5 2.718.  .  .  .  Many of the 
equations used in general chemistry are expressed most simply in terms of natural loga-
rithms, denoted as ln. If ex 5 n, then ln n 5 x.
	
ln 100 5 4.605	
(i.e., 100 5 e4.605)
	
ln 1 5 0	
(i.e., 1 5 e0)
ln 0.001 5 26.908    (i.e., 0.001 5 e26.908)
Notice that
(a)  log10 1 5 ln 1 5 0. The logarithm of 1 to any base is zero, because any number raised 
to the zero power is 1. That is
100 5 e0 5 20 5 ? ? ? 5 n0 5 1
(b)  Numbers larger than 1 have a positive logarithm; numbers smaller than 1 have a 
negative logarithm. For example,
	
log10 100 5 2	
ln 100 5 4.605
	
log10 10 5 1	
ln 10 5 2.303
	
log10 0.1 5 21	
ln 0.1 5 22.303
log10 0.01 5 22    ln 0.01 5 24.605
(c)  The common and natural logarithms of a number are related by the expression
ln n 5 2.303 log10n
That is, the natural logarithm of a number is 2.303 .  .  . times its base-10 logarithm.
(d)  Finally, if x # 0, both log x and ln x are undefined.
An inverse logarithm (antilogarithm) is the number corresponding to a given loga-
rithm. In general,
if mx 5 n, then inverse logm x 5 n
For example,
	
102 5 100	
inverse log10 2 5 100
1023 5 0.001    inverse log10 (23) 5 0.001
In other words, the numbers whose base-10 logarithms are 2 and 23 are 100 and 0.001, 
respectively. The same reasoning applies to natural logarithms.
	
e4.606 5 100	
inverse ln 4.606 5 100
e26.908 5 0.001    inverse ln 26.908 5 0.001
The numbers whose natural logarithms are 4.606 and 26.908 are 100 and 0.001, respec-
tively. Notice that if the inverse logarithm is positive, the corresponding number is larger 
than 1; if it is negative, the number is smaller than 1.
Finding Logarithms and Inverse Logarithms  
on a Calculator

To find the logarithm of an exponential number, you enter the number in exponen-
tial form and take the logarithm in the usual way. This way you should find that

log10 5.3 3 10212 5 211.28 .  .  .        ln 5.3 3 10212 5 225.96 .  .  .
The base-10 logarithm of an exponential number can be found in a somewhat differ-
ent way by applying the relation
log10 (C 3 10n) 5 n 1 log10 C
Thus
log10 2.00 3 103 5 3 1 log10 2.00 5 3 1 0.301 5 3.301
log10 5.3 3 10212 5 212 1 log10 5.3 5 212 1 0.72 5 211.28
The method used to find inverse logarithms depends on the type of calculator. On cer-
tain calculators, you enter the number and then press, in succession, the INV  and either 
LOG  or LN X  keys. With other calculators, you press the 10x  or ex  key. Either way, you 
should find that

Significant Figures in Logarithms and Inverse 
Logarithms
For base-10 logarithms, the rules governing significant figures are as follows:
1.  In taking the logarithm of a number, retain after the decimal point in the log as 
many digits as there are significant figures in the number. (This part of the logarithm 
is often referred to as the mantissa; digits that precede the decimal point comprise the 
characteristic of the logarithm.) To illustrate this rule, consider the following:
	
log10 2.00 5 0.301	
log10 (2.00 3 103) 5 3.301
	
log10 2.0 5 0.30	
log10 (2.0 3 101) 5 1.30
	
log10 2 5 0.3	
log10 (2 3 1023) 5 0.3 2 3 5 22.7
2.  In taking the inverse logarithm of a number, retain as many significant figures 
as there are after the decimal point in the number. Thus
inverse log10 0.301 5 2.00    inverse log10 3.301 5 2.00 3 103
	
inverse log10 0.30 5 2.0	
inverse log10 1.30 5 2.0 3 101
	
inverse log10 0.3 5 2	
inverse log10 (22.7) 5 2 3 1023
These rules take into account the fact that, as mentioned earlier,
log10 (C 3 10n) 5 n 1 log10 C
The digits that appear before (to the left of) the decimal point specify the value of n, that 
is, the power of 10 involved in the expression. In that sense, they are not experimentally 
significant. In contrast, the digits that appear after (to the right of) the decimal point 
specify the value of the logarithm of C; the number of such digits reflects the uncertainty 
in C. Thus,
	
log10 209 5 2.320	
(3 sig. fig.)
log10 209.0 5 2.3201    (4 sig. fig.)
The rules for significant figures involving natural logarithms and inverse logarithms 
are somewhat more complex than those for base-10 logs. However, for simplicity we will 
assume that the rules listed above apply here as well. Thus
	
ln 209 5 5.342

ln 209.0 5 5.3423    (4 sig. fig.)

Operations Involving Logarithms
Because logarithms are exponents, the rules governing the use of exponents apply as 
well. The rules that follow are valid for all types of logarithms, regardless of the base. We

in working with this text.

In Chapter 7, we used valence bond theory to explain bonding in molecules. It accounts, at 
least qualitatively, for the stability of the covalent bond in terms of the overlap of atomic 
orbitals. By invoking hybridization, valence bond theory can account for the molecular 
geometries predicted by electron-pair repulsion. Where Lewis structures are inadequate, 
as in SO2, the concept of resonance allows us to explain the observed properties.
A major weakness of valence bond theory has been its inability to predict the mag-
netic properties of molecules. We mentioned this problem in Chapter 7 with regard to 
the O2 molecule, which is paramagnetic, even though it has an even number (12) of va-
lence electrons. The octet rule, or valence bond theory, would predict that all the elec-
trons in O2 should be paired, which would make it diamagnetic.
This discrepancy between experiment and theory (and many others) can be ex-
plained in terms of an alternative model of covalent bonding, the molecular orbital 
(MO) approach. Molecular orbital theory treats bonds in terms of orbitals characteristic 
of the molecule as a whole. To apply this approach, we carry out three basic operations.
1.  The atomic orbitals of atoms are combined to give a new set of molecular orbitals 
characteristic of the molecule as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals formed is 
equal to the number of atomic orbitals combined. When two H atoms combine to form 
H2, two s orbi­tals, one from each atom, yield two molecular orbitals. In another case, six 
p orbitals, three from each atom, give a total of six molecular orbitals.
2.  The molecular orbitals are arranged in order of increasing energy. The relative 
energies of these orbitals are ordinarily deduced from experiment. Spectra and mag-
netic properties of molecules are used.
3.  The valence electrons in a molecule are distributed among the available molecular 
orbitals. The process followed is much like that used with electrons in atoms. In particu-
lar, we find the following:
(a)  Each molecular orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. When an orbital is 
filled the two electrons have opposed spins, in accordance with the Pauli principle 
(Chapter 7).
(b)  Electrons go into the lowest energy molecular orbital available. A higher orbital 
starts to fill only when each orbital below it has its quota of two electrons.
(c)  Hund’s rule is obeyed. When two orbitals of equal energy are available to two 
electrons, one electron goes into each, giving two half-filled orbitals.
Diatomic Molecules of the Elements
To illustrate molecular orbital theory, we apply it to the diatomic molecules of the ele-
ments in the first two periods of the periodic table.
Hydrogen and Helium (Combination of 1s Orbitals)
Molecular orbital (MO) theory predicts that two 1s orbitals will combine to give two 
molecular orbitals. One of these has an energy lower than that of the atomic orbitals 
from which it is formed (Figure 1, page 729). Placing electrons in this orbital gives a spe-
cies that is more stable than the isolated atoms. For that reason the lower molecular or-
bital in Figure 1 is called a bonding orbital. The other molecular orbital has a higher 
energy than the corresponding atomic orbitals. Electrons entering it are in an unstable, 
higher energy state. It is referred to as an antibonding orbital.
The electron density in these molecular orbitals is shown at the right of Figure 1. Notice 
that the bonding orbital has a higher density between the nuclei. This accounts for its stability. 
In the antibonding orbital, the chance of finding the electron between the nuclei is very small. 
The electron density is concentrated at the far ends of the “molecule.” This means that the 
nuclei are less shielded from each other than they are in the isolated atoms.
The electron density in both molecular orbitals is symmetrical about the axis be-
tween the two nuclei. This means that both of these are sigma orbitals. In MO notation, 
Appendix 4
Molecular Orbitals

  diatomic molecules of the elements
the 1s bonding orbital is designated as s1s. The antibonding orbital is given the symbol 
s*1s. An asterisk designates an antibonding orbital.
In the H2 molecule, there are two 1s electrons. They fill the s1s orbital, giving a single 
bond. In the He2 molecule, there would be four electrons, two from each atom. These 
would fill the bonding and antibonding orbitals. As a result, the number of bonds (the 
bond order) in He2 is zero. The general relation is
no. of bonds 5 bond order 5 B 2 AB
2
where B is the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and AB is the number of electrons 
in antibonding orbitals. In H2, B 5 2 and AB 5 0, so we have one bond. In He2, B 5 AB 5 2, 
so the number of bonds is zero. The He2 molecule should not and does not exist.
Second Period Elements (Combination of 2s and 2p 
Orbitals)
Among the diatomic molecules of the second period elements are three familiar ones, 
N2, O2, and F2. The molecules Li2, B2, and C2 are less common but have been observed 
and studied in the gas phase. In contrast, the molecules Be2 and Ne2 are either highly 
unstable or nonexistent. Let us see what molecular orbital theory predicts about the 
structure and stability of these molecules. We start by considering how the atomic orbit-
als containing the valence electrons (2s and 2p) are used to form molecular orbitals.
Combining two 2s atomic orbitals, one from each atom, gives two molecular orbit-
als. These are very similar to the ones shown above. They are designated as s2s (sigma, 
bonding, 2s) and s*2s (sigma, antibonding, 2s).
Consider now what happens to the 2p orbitals. In an isolated atom, there are three 
such orbitals, oriented at right angles to each other. We call these atomic orbitals, px, py, 
and pz (top of Figure 2, page 730). When two px atomic orbitals, one from each atom, 
overlap head-to-head, they form two sigma orbitals. These are a bonding orbital, s2p, 
and an antibonding orbital, s*2p. The situation is quite different when the pz orbitals over-
lap. Because they are oriented parallel to one another, they overlap side-to-side (Figure 
2c). The two molecular orbitals formed in this case are pi orbitals; one is a bonding or-
bital, p2p, the other a nonbonding orbital, p*2p. In an entirely similar way, the py orbitals 
of the two atoms interact to form another pair of pi molecular orbitals, p2p and p*2p 
(these orbitals are not shown in Figure 2).
The relative energies of the molecular orbitals available for occupancy by the va-
lence electrons of the second period elements are shown in Figure 3 (page 730). This 
order applies at least through N2.*

*It appears that beyond N2 the s2p orbital lies below the two p2p orbitals. This does not affect the filling order, 
because in O2 all of these orbitals are filled.

appendix 4  Molecular Orbitals
To obtain the MO structure of the diatomic molecules of the elements in the second 
period, we fill the available molecular orbitals in order of increasing energy. The results 
are shown in Table 1. Note the agreement between MO theory and the properties of these 
molecules. In particular, the number of unpaired electrons predicted agrees with experi-
ment. There is also a general correlation between the predicted bond order:
bond order 5 B 2 AB
2
and the bond energy. We would expect a double bond (C2 or O2) to be stronger than a 
single bond (Li2, B2, and F2). A triple bond, as in N2, should be still stronger.
A major triumph of MO theory is its ability to explain the properties of O2. It ex-
plains how the molecule can have a double bond and, at the same time, have two un-
paired electrons.
For example, using MO theory we can predict the electronic structure, bond order, 
and number of unpaired electrons in the peroxide ion.
Recalling that oxygen is in Group 16 of the periodic table, the number of valence 
electrons is 14 (2 3 6 1 2), and the orbital diagram is:

Polyatomic Molecules; Delocalized p Electrons
The bonding in molecules containing more than two atoms can also be described in 
terms of molecular orbitals. We will not attempt to do this; the energy level structure is 
considerably more complex than the one we considered. However, one point is worth 
mentioning. In polyatomic species, a pi molecular orbital can be spread over the entire 
molecule rather than being concentrated between two atoms.
This principle can be applied to species such as the nitrate ion, whose Lewis structure is:

Valence bond theory (Chapter 7) explains the fact that the three N ! O bonds are identi-
cal by invoking the idea of resonance, with three contributing structures. MO theory, on

appendix 4  Molecular Orbitals
sigma bonds while the electron pair in the pi orbital is delocalized, shared by all of the 
atoms in the molecule. According to MO theory, a similar interpretation applies with all 
of the “resonance hybrids” described in Chapter 7, including SO2, SO3, and CO322.
Another species in which delocalized pi orbitals play an important role is benzene, 
C6H6. There are 30 valence electrons in the molecule, 24 of which are required to form 
the sigma bond framework:

The remaining six electrons are located in three p orbitals, which according to MO the-

more commonly it is shown simply as
Metals; Band Theory
In Chapter 9, we considered a simple picture of metallic bonding, the electron–sea model. 
The molecular orbital approach leads to a refinement of this model known as band theo-
ry. Here, a crystal of a metal is considered to be one huge molecule. Valence electrons of 
the metal are fed into delocalized molecular orbitals, formed in the usual way from 
atomic orbitals. A huge number of these MOs are grouped into an energy band; the en-
ergy separation between adjacent MOs is extremely small.
For purposes of illustration, consider a lithium crystal weighing one gram, which 
contains roughly 1023 atoms. Each Li atom has a half-filled 2s atomic orbital (elect. conf. 
Li 5 1s22s1). When these atomic orbitals combine, they form an equal number, 1023, 
of molecular orbitals. These orbitals are spread over an energy band covering about 
100 kJ/mol. It follows that the spacing between adjacent MOs is of the order of
100 kJ/mol
1023
 5 10221 kJ/mol
Because each lithium atom has one valence electron and each molecular orbital can 
hold two electrons, it follows that the lower half of the valence band (shown in color in

Empty MOs
Filled MOs
Figure 5 In both lithium and beryllium metal, there are vacant MOs only slightly higher in en-
ergy than filled MOs. This is the basic requirement for metallic conductivity.
Figure 4 In benzene, three electron 
pairs are not localized on particular 
carbon atoms. Instead, they are spread 
out over two lobes of the shape shown, 
one above the plane of the benzene 
ring and the other below it.

  metals; band theory
Figure 5, page 732) is filled with electrons. The upper half of the band is empty. Electrons 
near the top of the filled MOs can readily jump to empty MOs only an infinitesimal dis-
tance above them. This is what happens when an electrical field is applied to the crystal; 
the movement of electrons through delocalized MOs accounts for the electrical conduc-
tivity of lithium metal.
The situation in beryllium metal is more complex. We might expect all of the 2s 
molecular orbitals to be filled because beryllium has the electron configuration 1s22s2. 
However, in a crystal of beryllium, the 2p MO band overlaps the 2s (Figure 5). This 
means that, once again, there are vacant MOs that differ only infinitesimally in energy 
from filled MOs below them. This is indeed the basic requirement for electron conduc-
tivity; it is characteristic of all metals, including lithium and beryllium.
Materials in which there is a substantial difference in energy between occupied 
and vacant MOs are poor electron conductors. Diamond, where the gap between the 
filled valence band and the empty conduction band is 500 kJ/mol, is an insulator. Sili-
con and germanium, where the gaps are 100 kJ/mol and 60 kJ/mol respectively, are 
semiconductors.

at 1008C 5 29.7 mm Hg
 
 Vapor pressures: at 408C 5 55.3 mm Hg; at 708C 5 233.7 mm Hg; 
at 1008C 5 760 mm Hg
 
 Vapor pressure implies the presence of some liquid together with the vapor. 
As T increases, more liquid becomes gas, increasing n and thus P.
