Introduction
As the complexity of investments continues to proliferate, and as the global 
economy evolves, institutional pools of capital are suffering from too much 
risk and not enough return. In many instances, these pools of capital are the 
lifeblood of the organization, while in some circumstances it’s these pools 
of investable assets that are the organization. Yet investment management is 
seldom an integral part of the institution’s core mission or its operations. In 
fact, it’s often not treated with the same type of business intention that other 
parts of the organization (development, grants, IT, marketing, finance, legal) 
receive. There are many potential justifications for this dichotomy between 
the investment management program and the rest of the organization, but 
one common culprit is “that’s the way it has always been” syndrome, which 
needs to be reevaluated and fixed. 
Another culprit is cost. Yes, it’s expensive to adequately staff and equip an 
internal investment office, but the popular myth that a fiduciary’s primary 
focus must be on cost is hogwash. It is also untrue that cost is the only 
thing a fiduciary has control over. In truth, a fiduciary’s primary mission is to 
act in the organization’s best interest, which means cost can and should be 
considered, but it’s certainly not the only factor, or even the most important 
factor. 
A few years ago I (and probably every other CIO in the country) got a phone 
call and was offered a job as the CIO of a large ($30 billion at that time) state 
employee pension plan. The compensation was miniscule, so I (and all the 
other candidates) turned it down. It seems they could not pay more than a 
certain fraction of the governor’s salary. They eventually got someone that 
needed to pad a resume, and then someone else, and then increased the comp 
slightly, before going through several more CIOs. They saved a lot of money 
in compensation, but their funding level dropped drastically over this time 
period in spite of a strong equity market. They were penny wise and dollar 
foolish, using rules that didn’t work with investments. The ultimate cost to top 
off the fund was far, far more that the cost of an experienced CIO.
Another, and perhaps even the most insidious, culprit is time, or lack thereof. 
Make no mistake about it; managing a company, foundation, or university is 
a full-time job, as is managing a team, or an audit. Managing investments is 
just as full-time. Unfortunately a CFO, CEO, treasurer, or the like, cannot 
focus on investments and do their day job at the same time—it’s just not

possible if one expects superior (or even just good) performance. A board 
or investment committee, meeting only a few hours each quarter, or worse, 
three times a year? Fugettaboutit. 
“How can a group of individuals (trustees) focus their limited resources 
in a way that can fully address all of the issues spanning everything from 
high level policy issues to manager selection and monitoring—and do it 
in the time they have?”
This is the question posed by Peter Bernstein at a large investment conference, 
and the answer is obvious: they can’t. But then, neither can the board of any 
large company do all the day-to-day tasks necessary in running that business 
either. Tacking on investments as a collateral duty to a CFO or treasurer is 
not only unfair to the CFO, but is also a recipe for disaster.
Managing the investments for a foundation or endowment is much like 
managing a business of the same size. It takes capable staff, management with 
experience and skill in the field of investments, and a board or committee 
experienced in governing, like the board of directors for a business. If you 
owned a car dealership, would you hire someone to run it who said they 
“knew” all about cars because they drove one? Would you expect the board 
to approve each car sale and service invoice? What about using a consultant 
that showed up once every quarter and told you what happened to sales 
over the last three months, then said you needed a new sales manager and 
left? Oh yeah, he would be back in three months with three candidates. 
Would you hire a president for your hospital because they had spent a few 
days as a patient in one, or because they were a good manager of a real 
estate company or the local bank? Perhaps you would expect the board to 
make each diagnosis? Or, maybe you would hire as CFO someone who kept 
the household accounts? Or, yet again, would you as a board member of an 
organization spend your couple of hours each quarter trying to close the 
books, or handle the staffing issues? The answer should be a resounding no 
in each case, at least if you expect the organization to last. 
These are not fatuous flights of fancy; they happen every day in the world 
of institutional investing. The question is then, “Why do so many boards 
and investment committees try to make all the decisions about investments 
themselves?” Some hear the word “fiduciary” and think they have to make 
each decision, but aren’t they just as “fiduciary” to the rest of the organization? 
These same committees would not dream of taking over the role of CFO or 
CEO, even if supported by a consultant, but have no problem taking the role 
of chief investment officer, essentially the CEO of a separate business. 
Why do they do it? We will leave that to the behaviorists. What we can 
know and prove is that when a committee focuses on strategic governance 
and experienced staff handles investments, success is highly predictable. 

Introduction
xvii
The success of any business is dependent on two important elements. The 
first is a board with a vision and governance designed for success, and the 
second is management, skilled not only in the industry but in management 
of a business within that industry. Don’t be fooled; the investment fund of a 
foundation or university is as much a business separate from its foundation or 
university as any other business might be. A successful fund needs the same 
quality and industry specificity in both governance and management as any 
other business. Investment funds are truly unrelated to the everyday business 
of the university or foundation. Boards and staff skilled in the purpose and 
management of a foundation or in educating students are seldom equipped 
or skilled at managing an investment business. Nor should they be, if the 
foundation or university is to prosper at its tasks and reason for existence. 
Several universities have even set up their investment offices as separate 
companies so that governance can be focused on the unique needs of an 
investment company rather than those of a university.
The impact of the investment portfolio often has an outsized and 
disproportionate impact on the organization. Large endowments have 
been extremely successful in creating billions of dollars in assets for leading 
universities and foundations through their investment operations. In 2007, 
the CommonFund reported that each of the 75 largest endowments added 
an average of over $400 million to their assets from investment returns, 
compared to an average of $50 million in gifts and donations. For an 
endowment or foundation, even (and perhaps especially) small ones, the 
investment function is often worth several times the development function. 
Managing these assets is a business—a big business. 
What is it about the successful investing of organizations that make them 
that way? A study found that the one thing that was the most predictive of 
success for these endowments and foundations was an investment office 
comprised of experienced investment officers and, we would add, an 
investment committee that provides governance but not management. In this 
study, those funds that failed more often had an investment committee that 
tried to make day-to-day decisions itself or tasked a CFO to add investments 
to his or her already full agenda; whether they had a consultant or not made 
no difference.
Success comes from the sophisticated and knowledgeable investment staff 
that endowments employ coupled with the governance models their boards 
use. The combination of sophisticated investments, long time horizons, the 
best third party managers and, importantly, access to quality investment staff, 
all contribute to the significant performance of these major endowments. 
In the 1970’s, endowment managers were the first to look beyond what 
was then the standard mix of stocks and bonds as they began to explore 
new sources of information and returns. They ventured into international 
equities, private equity, real estate, venture capital and even hedge funds. 

Introduction 
xviii
They called this expanded use of investment classes—asset allocation 
and the heavy use of so-called alternative investments, and the selling of 
liquidity—the Endowment Model. Over time, these endowment managers 
learned and grew. They became more sophisticated and more focused on the 
delivery of dollars to support an organization’s budget. The best of today’s 
investment officers diversify across multiple sources of information, different 
methods of return generation, and different sources of risk rather than so 
called “classes” of assets. 
Looking over the shoulder of successful funds has led some to believe that the 
Endowment Model is simply buying hedge funds, private equity, or venture 
capital in the naive belief that simply paying 2 and 20 will somehow create top 
decile returns. That the rather talented marketers of hedge funds and their 
friends the consultants trumpet this misconception does not make it so. The 
Endowment Model is simply a highly diversified portfolio with an equity bias 
(currently) and a long-term investment horizon. Diversification sometimes 
includes these hedge and private equity funds, but they are not required. 
Over the last 20 years, Yale has moved from 60% domestic equity to about 
10%, while increasing allocations in international equity, private equity and 
real assets. Even the average large foundation has changed its allocation 
over time, dropping its domestic equity allocation to 25% while maintaining 
the equity-like elements of the portfolio well over 60%. The experience of 
investment offices in evaluating the changing environment has differentiated 
endowments that today are the leading edge of portfolio management. 
What is obvious is that these investment officers did not hold to static 
target allocations, but instead changed with the times and based on future 
expectations. One can assuredly expect that over the next 10 years the 
allocations will change again and will be different from those used today. It 
is this willingness to look forward by their experienced in-house investment 
staff, supplemented by good governance and strong investment committees, 
that make these endowments such leaders.
In every study of fund performance, larger funds on average outperform 
smaller ones. This is because the larger ones generally have investment 
offices and skilled staff. Skilled investment professionals and staff with strong 
networks lead to lesser known but lucrative investment opportunities 
sourced and diligenced by the most senior of the in-house staff, while smaller 
funds are left to depend on the consulting firm’s junior staff. 
For years, small funds have looked at the superior returns of large endowments 
and tried to replicate this success. They see that a marquee fund has X% in 
“alternatives,” so the board says to their consultant, “do that,” then are 
dismayed when their performance is a fraction of the marquee fund that they 
tried to emulate. While they can follow some of these strategies, they find it 

Introduction

difficult to replicate the skill, structure, environment and motivation of the 
investment offices of the large funds. These smaller funds have tried to get by 
with the use of a stopgap; but doing it yourself, with or without a consultant, 
is just not the same as a staff investment officer, and the difference has been 
apparent. For pension plans, especially the public plans, the difference is even 
more dramatic (appallingly so). 
Endowment investment officers are not captive to the quarterly committee 
meeting cycle like a board or consultant, where at each meeting the committee 
has to have something to “do”—an activity, a decision, a discussion of the 
news of the day, or the floor show of a manager presentation. These large 
endowments are managed not only with patience over a long information 
cycle, but, with an investment officer. They also have the ability to conduct 
a short cycle review, and someone to act outside the standard committee 
meeting timing.
Well-run endowments have investment committees that use their time not 
to share or find personal investment ideas, but for long term planning and 
evaluation of governance. These well-run endowments have a plan and use 
the investment officer to help develop and execute that plan. They use their 
investment committee like a board to review and approve the plan, and then 
to evaluate the execution of the plan. The less well-run funds add investments 
ad hoc after seeing a presentation or learning of some other group that 
uses the investment. These same underperforming organizations ask their 
investment committee to review and evaluate themselves, not surprisingly, 
never seem to find themselves lacking. One California university consistently 
performed at the bottom of the NACUBO study for years until they were 
called out in an online blog as having one of the ten worst CIOs. Only this 
headline publicity caused them to finally change investment officers, even 
though their president emeritus (and investment committee member) was 
told repeatedly over several years of the problem. 
One can see the difference quickly in the conversation at board meetings: 
“Why does this need to be in our portfolio?,” “Why did you select that size 
for that investment?,” and “How does it affect our risk budget?” vs. “Well, 
X use these guys, so they must be okay,” or “I am on another committee 
that uses X, Y or Z asset class,” or “Let’s give them a small amount and see 
what happens,” or even “Check out that performance!” One also sees the 
difference in the due diligence focus. 
In the better funds, the evaluation of information and return sources and 
the ability to extract return at an acceptable level of risk is passed to the 
investment officer, who has specialization and experience. In the case of less 
stellar funds, reviewing the social connections, client list and performance 
takes up the board’s time. The most telling example is the Madoff event, 

Introduction 
xx
where those professionals that saw the red flags and backed away saved their 
foundations, while those that saw only social position and client list suffered 
mightily. More pointedly, a group of major organizations, with separate 
boards making decisions all with the same investment consultant but diverse 
goals, were invested heavily in the same group of failed hedge funds, including 
Madoff, to their disappointment. Each had different needs, but all had the 
same portfolio courtesy of the consultant. Even more incredible: they didn’t 
fire the consultant. You wonder why. 
When a fund uses a planned strategy where investments are coordinated and 
work with each other balancing and managing related risks, that fund gets 
better performance with less risk of failure. They use a staff that is personally 
invested in success and is an advocate driving the progress toward a goal, 
which lets the board focus on governance and evaluation. 
The model using a consultant is different. Consultants are paid to bring or 
vet “options” and “ideas.” The consultant’s job is to sell new ideas or new 
projects. Their job is to throw stuff at the wall, always a new idea to be 
decided on, but deciding what sticks becomes the board’s responsibility. In 
this environment, the board must have a planned strategy for the long term 
and hold to it—difficult for members with limited time, competing interests, 
and no experience in managing large complex funds. With this approach there 
is no baseline or long-term plan, since each investment is a stand-alone idea 
and all decisions are made ad hoc by the board, therefore all responsibility 
lies with the board, and the board is accountable to only itself. They always 
sound like the right things to do when the consultant starts using the F word 
(fiduciary), but when the board only works four hours a quarter it is difficult, 
if not impossible, to do it well. 
The question then comes to how an organization manages itself and actually 
creates the investment return needed. The purpose of this book is to answer 
these questions by first examining how most organizations now execute their 
investment function and why it does not work; and then explore the best of 
the alternative options.
Our bias here is the staff model—that should be obvious by now. We 
believe that seeing the investment function as a business activity or division, 
and treating the CIO as the president of that division with the investment 
committee acting as its board of directors to provide governance, works 
best. The committee sets governance and the CIO executes. Yes, this really 
does work best, but we also recognize that not everyone is willing or even 
able to use this approach. Whichever approach is used, committee members 
need some tools to develop and execute their governance duties and to 
think about investments. This book is dedicated to providing a fresh look at 
those tools.

Introduction
xxi
The two parts that make the whole of a business managing assets for 
pensions, endowments, or foundations are Governance and Investments. 
Our Governance section will explore the various things a committee 
member must know and do, and several different approaches toward them. 
The Investments chapters will explore different investment approaches and 
the optimal way to execute each one. Ideally, the investment committee 
of the board handles the governance and the investment office handles the 
investments. There are variations on this theme of board vs. management, 
and we discuss them here.

Procrustes Rules
In the ancient Greek myths there was a blacksmith named Procrustes who had 
a magic bed; an iron bed that fit whoever slept in it. He let any traveler passing 
by try it out overnight and—would wonders never cease!—they all fit perfectly. 
Of course, it wasn't because of the bed. Rather, if the traveler was too short, 
Procrustes stretched him to the proper length, and if too long, lopped off the 
offending parts. This myth has come down to us today as a way to describe 
fitting a particular element into a predetermined shape or structure, adding 
where there is too little and discarding where there is too much.
It is also a good description of someone who is making your governance 
documents, procedures or reports, and even investments fit some structure 
established by a supposed third party authority. Stretch to fill out or lop off 
the excess. It is the ultimate extension of the notion that “this is the way it’s 
always done!” There is always someone who has a need to fit documents and 
processes into another’s format and rules. It is often but not always, a lawyer 
or an accountant but at other times it just someone with an internal need to 
follow “rules” for these documents or procedures. It is always, however, some-
one who does not fully understand investing, believing that others must know 
more and expects that someone else's document or process will CYA.
Whatever the root cause, you can find Mr. or Ms. Procrustes hurriedly skim-
ming the report or document during the meeting, but frustrated that the parts 
they know are not where they expect to find them. Then again, Mr. or Ms. 
Procrustes may be insisting that their organization's investment policy needs 
to look like some other foundation's, or that their asset allocation needs to 
look like some other's. They do this because they don’t understand the issues 
at hand and are not interested enough to learn, or because they haven’t both-
ered to read and think about the information at hand prior to the discussion. 
They just want to check off familiar items in the order they're accustomed 
to. To Mr. or Ms. Procrustes, management requires checking the boxes on the

checklist in order. The more limited to that iron frame they are, adding or 
subtracting parts that don’t fit, the more rigid the portfolio becomes, and the 
more it misses the mark.
Following some elements of format may not be bad; after all, there are simi-
larities and some requirements can be fulfilled pretty much the same way. 
However, many, if not most, of these governance and investment elements 
are your set of decisions for your unique circumstances. Just because some 
other investment policy differs from yours doesn’t mean yours is wrong or 
that yours needs to be changed. Maybe the other guy needs the change. Your 
regular reports should have the things you need rather than many pages of fill 
that you won’t read. Your procedures should fit your governance, not some 
other foundation’s. Your asset allocation should fit your requirements. And, 
that comment from the back of the room using the f word: fiduciary. Being a 
fiduciary means taking care of the fund and making decisions for your fund’s 
benefit, not following others as CYA protection for the board.
The path trod by others might work well for their purposes, but it may or may 
not be the best for you. Just because “others have” is no reason to climb into 
Procrustes' bed. It may not fit after all.

Fiduciary 
Responsibilities
While serving as a trustee, you will have many different responsibilities—
some that you are probably aware of and others that you are not. Ultimately 
as a trustee your primary responsibility rests with ensuring the best interests 
of the organization and/or stakeholders. Depending on the organization, these 
stakeholders will vary.
For example, if you sit on a hospital board there may be multiple pools of 
assets, each with their own stakeholders. One set of stakeholders may be 
the participants in the hospital’s pension plan, while the operating fund may 
have an entirely different set of interests. Alternatively, you could be on a local  
university board where an endowment was established to provide students 
with financial aid, which consequently makes future and present students 
the beneficiaries. Or perhaps you serve a foundation working with children, 
whereby as a board member you have to ensure the wellbeing of the children 
(the ultimate beneficiaries). As a board member, you will ensure the interests 
of the stakeholders (beneficiaries), whoever they may be, and bear a fiduciary 
responsibility to the organization, entity, or trust.
Because you have been placed in a position of trust, you have a duty to  
administer the assets with care and prudence, a duty to exercise reasonable 
diligence and skill, and a duty to maintain loyalty to the organization. These five 
duties share some characteristics in common and oftentimes are all lumped 
into a single responsibility called “prudence.” However you decide to slice and 
dice them, they all exist and are all a requirement of the job.

Chapter 2 | Fiduciary Responsibilities

Loyalty
Your first and perhaps most important duty is loyalty. Loyalty to the organiza-
tion and its stakeholders takes precedence over any other job, concern, or 
business. The reason for this is to prevent self-dealing and to keep one con-
stituency from benefiting over another. While it may seem obvious to place 
loyalty to others over all else, regrettably, this duty is the most often violated. 
Even though it is not always done purposefully, and in many instances it is 
inadvertent, a breach of your duty of loyalty is a serious offense, regardless of 
intent. Loyalty snuggles up close to ethics, as well—you really can’t be loyal 
and unethical at the same time. As challenging as it may seem, you really need 
to know yourself and whether the decisions you are about to make are in fact 
for the benefit of the fund or for some other reason.
Loyalty, or the lack thereof, could be as simple as how you view your advisor. 
Being unhappy with your advisor for a reason unrelated to their responsibilities 
toward your organization isn’t necessarily justification to find a replacement. 
Being comfortable with an old friend when their performance is inferior, is not 
being loyal to your fund if you continue to employ that person. Maintaining an 
advisor simply because they make large donations to your organization is not 
being loyal to your fund, even if they would be difficult to replace as a donor. 
In each of these scenarios, and the many variations on this theme you must 
ensure that the organization takes precedence over all else. The situations you 
will likely encounter will differ from these examples, but at some point during 
your time as a board member, a loyalty issue will certainly rear its ugly head. 
How you and your fellow board members respond will dictate the ultimate 
success or failure of your organization. Loyalty is not a difficult concept to 
grasp, but each situation will be unique. Here are some real life examples of 
fiduciary loyalty misconduct:
Example 1:
A group of retired pension fund members elects a new trustee. The newly elected 
trustee feels indebted and seeks enhanced health care benefits for his retired “con-
stituents,” knowing full well that the enhanced health benefits will lower the fund’s 
coverage ratio, which would be detrimental to the non-retired members. The trustee 
pushes for the benefits and ultimately wins.
Example 2:
Trustee number two was recently appointed to sit on the board of the defined ben-
efit plan of their employer. In their new role, the trustee sees their only duty as that 
of reducing the employer contribution rates for the general benefit of the employer, 
even though the plan is underfunded.
In both instances, the trustees were fundamentally wrong. As a trustee, you 
owe your loyalty and duty to all stakeholders, not to the constituents who 
elected or appointed you. In the first example, the newly elected trustee

violated the loyalty responsibility by harming the defined benefit plan for future 
beneficiaries. In the second example, the trustee violated her duty of loyalty 
because her allegiances were with the employer and not the plan as a whole.
Example 3:
An individual who sits on a foundation’s board has a personal relationship with  
a consultant at a large broker-dealer. The large broker-dealer is willing to remuner-
ate the trustee if he is able to convince other members that the consultant should 
oversee the foundation’s funds. The broker-dealer has subpar performance and there 
are a handful of better alternatives available to the foundation. The trustee ultimately 
wins the debate, and the consultant is hired.
Although Example 3 is a bit more blatant and observable, these types of deals 
occur throughout the industry. Pay-to-play is not uncommon and works in 
both directions. Unfortunately, we only hear about the ones who get caught.
Example 4:
A new member convinces the committee that their current advisor, one who has 
successfully built the foundation’s assets significantly, should be replaced. The new 
member believes the foundation needs a “brand name” advisor to match the foun-
dation’s importance and asset size. A brand name advisor is hired, even though their 
historical performance is lackluster.
This breach is much more subtle and may be a variation on Example 2, with 
the pay part being a non-monetary benefit; either the new member is person-
ally unhappy with the old advisor, wants to exert power, wants to advantage an 
old friend, or is Procrustes’ heir and wants to be like everyone else.
Skill
The second duty you must exhibit is skill. “A pure heart and empty head will 
not do.” For that reason, you must develop and use skills necessary to manage 
these funds, or you must delegate those tasks that you don’t have the time 
or expertise to do yourself. The level of skill required is different for different 
types of funds. Your decisions in governance will determine which standard 
of skill you will be held to. In some cases, like ERISA (Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act), you have little choice and will be held to the more strin-
gent prudent expert rule.
The traditional level of skill, or “prudent man rule” as it’s more informally 
known, is based on the concept that each Board member has the skills and 
knowledge of a typical person (businessman, doctor, fireman, or whatever pro-
fession that board member may be). The prudent man rule, which is a relatively 
less -stringent standard, is often used by foundations and endowments. On 
the other hand, the ERISA “prudent expert” rule requires a skill level of “one 
knowledgeable in like and similar matters,” in other words, an “expert” or 

Chapter 2 | Fiduciary Responsibilities
8
professional. If you choose to use the older definition (prudent man) you can 
either manage the portfolio yourself or hire professionals, but if you use the 
prudent expert standard you’d better get well-educated or hire some profes-
sional help. This decision (prudent man vs. prudent expert) is largely depen-
dent upon the legality of the organization’s situation. ERISA plans must obey 
the prudent expert rule, while other entities have a bit more flexibility.
Example: One university’s investment committee chairman is at the pinnacle of a 
narrow part of the investment world. He is incredibly knowledgeable and skilled in 
that narrow sub-sector. However, he has an inadequate understanding of multi-asset 
portfolios. This can be seen in the university’s performance, which is near the bottom 
of all universities for many years. However, the university’s investment committee 
fails to hire someone with the necessary skill set to manage the portfolio because 
the chairman’s stature within this narrow space is so high that they relied heavily 
on his opinion when discussing “investments”—particularly investments within the 
university’s portfolio. It isn’t until a blogger posts about the top ten worst performing 
university endowments before a change is made. Even though the chairman has 
an esteemed investment background, he does not have the necessary skill set to 
­manage a multi-asset portfolio. They are two entirely different animals.
As the famed management consultant Peter Drucker once said, “do what you 
do best, and outsource the rest.” If the investment committee or board doesn’t 
have the necessary skills to accomplish the tasks at hand (and ­obviously this 
chairman didn’t), they need to obtain the skills or to hire someone with the 
necessary skills, or seek outside professional help. 
Care
The next duty you must exhibit is care. Care is the responsibility of ensuring 
the collection of funds and monies due to the sponsor (such as the plan, foun-
dation, or endowment) are received. This includes interest, fees for money 
lent, employer/employee contributions, dividends, brokerage dollars from 
commission recapture, soft dollars, security litigation proceeds, etc. Care also 
ensures that beneficiaries are informed about the financial standing and finan-
cial security of the fund. Care also requires the board to evaluate both implicit 
and explicit costs associated with brokerage, manager soft dollars, potential 
shareholder litigation proceeds, or custodial arrangement.
Example: A large state employees plan was buying securities that were sold net 
(fees, markups, and commissions included) but were also being charged a commis-
sion in addition.
The trustees at this particular employee plan were not exhibiting duty of care, 
as their broker was charging them twice on their commissions.

Prudence
The fourth duty—prudence—is often the most discussed, but in practice it 
is hard to detect its abuse. Essentially, when you act with prudence, you act 
in good judgment, with knowledge and deal advisably toward all fund mat-
ters. You monitor and manage the actions of staff and outside professionals, 
as well as assess the skill levels of both. The questions to ask yourself are: 1) 
“Have I used reason, or emotion?” 2) “Is this advisable?” and 3) “Does it make 
sense, or am I just following the lead of others?” Particular care must be taken 
because Procrustes lives here. It is too easy to force yourself into someone 
else’s practice and think you are being prudent. Some gather several fiduciary 
duties under the rubric of prudence, and a failure of one can therefore also 
be a failure of prudence. See Example 4 under Loyalty. Is it prudent to fire a 
well-known and productive advisor just to look like others with a brand name 
advisor? Most often failure of prudence is directed at decisions that were not 
well thought through, or decisions that did not take into account foreseeable 
issues and knock-on effects. Is it prudent to sell all equities after a market 
crash? Is it prudent to insist on five years of firm history? What about the 
person who just stepped out of a large firm to start their own? Is it wise to 
buy long bonds when the foundation has a short-term need for cash? Where 
is the common sense when you hire a manager who has never had anything 
but massive returns without investigation just because your friend uses him? 
(Madoff, anyone?)
Failure of prudence is easy to see after the fact. The difficulty arises before-
hand, when you must control yourself and others as well. The only solution is 
a detailed discussion and investigation of all the risks, the costs of failure and 
a brake on enthusiasm. 
Diligence
Diligence is the last of the five duties and is relatively straightforward. 
Diligence implies that adequate attention is being delivered. To fulfill the dili-
gence responsibility, you must be doing trustee and not just being trustee. But 
what is adequate? Is it enough to just show up once per quarter? Should you 
read and understand the entire suite of reports? Is it enough to read outside 
of the meeting reports? Unlike Justice Potter Stewart’s pronouncement on 
pornography, this is one you notice when you don’t see it.
Example: A committee member shows up late, did not preview the report, and 
then asks questions already answered by the report.
A committee member who is not prepared for meetings is not only being 
disrespectful to their fellow committee members, but is also likely making 
decisions on a whim instead of diligently—a complete failure by the trustee.

Chapter 2 | Fiduciary Responsibilities
10
Taken as a whole, these five duties, and prudence in particular, are inherently 
conservative in that they favor the status quo and eschew change, even if it 
is advantageous change. Investing by its very nature means working with risk, 
and a decision to make no change is the same as a decision to change. Board 
and investment committee members that use the prudential rule as a deci-
sion rule rather than an element of decision making, rule out innovation when 
­warranted, sway stakeholders away from risks they would or should other-
wise take, and inhibit opportunities they would otherwise embrace. On the 
other side of that same coin, bad decisions or no decision can be sold as good 
governance if prudence is the decision rule.
Executing your duties as a fiduciary is the implementation of governance. 
Governance is the process and implementation of decision-making as a 
fiduciary. 

Ethics
In his recent book, The Economist’s Oath (Oxford University Press, 2011), 
economist and renowned ethicist Dr. George DeMartino described ethics 
in some of the same terms we normally reserve for fiduciary: loyalty and 
prudence. So, is there a difference? Can that difference be described as “one 
is legal and the other moral?” Moral is hard to put your finger on, as it devel-
ops in each of us differently from teachings and experiences at home, or in  
the church or synagogue, and from life. Everyone seems to know or have 
some understanding of ethics, and most see it as right vs. wrong. So is writing a 
code of ethics an attempt to convert from the moral to the legal, and thereby 
control ethical questions?
For a board of individuals given authority and trust to manage the funds of  
an organization, is there a defined set of rules to follow? To make all the heirs 
of Procrustes happy, most organizations establish a set of rules that addresses 
insider trading, receipt of gifts, inter-related party contracts, nepotism,  
pay-to-play, quid-pro-quo, third party relationships, former trustee/employee 
relationships, and whistle-blowers. These rules are then stretched or cut to fit 
each and every situation that comes along, which generally makes these rules 
ether too specific or too general. There may be too many rules, or too few. 
But are rules enough? Does the existence of a written policy ensure ethical 
behavior? How is behavior enforced, and what exactly is ethical?
Do ethics change if the actors change? Consider a PPM for Private Equity 
Fund presented by a salesman to your lawyer. Your lawyer approves the PPM; 
is it ethical or not for the salesman to fail to point out a clause that may not 
be in your best interest? What if he doesn’t tell you that a certain clause can 
be negotiated— is he unethical? It may not be nice or even what you would 
want, but is it ethical on the part of the salesman to contradict your expe-
rienced and sophisticated lawyer? Most would agree that the salesman has 
fully executed his duty to you and your lawyer (both legal and moral) if he 
discloses all of the facts. The PPM listed all the facts and that was the duty of 
3
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 3 | Ethics
12
the salesman; but does he owe an additional duty to you and your lawyer to 
interpret those facts? Probably not.
Does the answer change if the buyer is an 87-year-old retired fireman instead 
of a multi-million dollar fund with a dedicated chief investment officer? Does 
the answer change if the person promoting the investment is not the sales-
man, but a lawyer acting as advisor to the fireman? Definitely.
The SEC came in to do their standard exam of an investment advisor and, 
being generally nice people the advisor offered coffee and some muffins. The 
examiners made a very big point of refusing the muffins because it was against 
the written ethics policy—and they couldn’t be swayed. Really? If they could 
not be trusted to know what was a bribe and what was not, could they be 
trusted to do a fair and competent exam? If they could be bribed with a muffin, 
there is no wonder why Madoff was not caught sooner. If an ethics code was 
so narrowly defined, then anything not proscribed in the code must be okay. 
Right? If your code says no lunches may be paid for by an investment manager, 
then it must be okay if you pay the bill and the manager instead introduces 
you to the leading lights of your particular industry? If your ethics code says 
not to accept any solo (i.e., one-on-one) trips with a potential manager, then 
it must be okay if there are other potential investors present, right? I guess 
that weeklong Disney World trip for all the manager’s clients must meet your 
idea of ethical. There are hundreds of ways around a rule, but no way around 
true ethical behavior.
Not all ethical principles or policies apply to all groups equally or in identical 
ways. Ethics and policy must be tailored to each group, and even then there 
is inequality in applying the rules, which is why there is no “Uniform Code of 
Ethics for all Boards and Professions.” For example, if you only play golf at the 
local muni course, a few invitations to Augusta may impact your decisions, and 
thus an over-written ethics code may exclude any golf; but if you are a member 
at Augusta, is an invite to a local muni course going to sway your vote? Your 
moral compass may be unaffected, such that you are able to look past the golf. 
There is, however, the appearance of a conflict, and appearances might matter. 
So, are ethics not only what you do but also what it looks like you are doing, 
or even might be doing? Does being ethical mean becoming Caesar’s wife?
For a member of a board or investment committee, the primary concern 
is being and doing as a fiduciary: loyalty, care, skill, prudence, and diligence. 
DeMartino says, “They must take care to put the interests of those served 
above their own; and they must take care not to impose avoidable risks in 
hopes of bringing about favorable outcomes.” This is virtually the definition 
of loyalty and prudence used in the discussion of fiduciary duty in the last 
­chapter. Does that mean that being ethical and being a fiduciary is the same 
thing? They certainly are similar, but do they come into conflict? They shouldn’t, 
but sometimes do.

Ethics in the sense of both “not harming” and “advocating for” your fund is 
part of the key, I believe. This is doing or not doing what is in the best interests 
of the organization or the fund. Where ethics and fiduciary part is when one 
begins to believe that what is in one member’s or the whole committee’s best 
interest is also in the fund’s best interest. It is service to the institution’s ends 
and not to one’s own ends that points to the difference between fiduciary and 
ethical. When one works only in the interests of the organization, one is both 
ethical and fiduciary. When one begins to include what is good for one’s self 
with what is good for the institution, one loses or violates ethics, even if you 
are convinced that what is good you is also good for the fund. What is inter-
esting to note is that the same members being asked to be ethical and work 
only in the interest of the institution are the same members that establish 
what those interests are.
The focus of most “ethics” discussions by boards revolves around obvious 
elements including insider trading, receipt of certain gifts, inter-related party 
contracts, nepotism, pay-to-play, quid-pro-quo, third party relationships, for-
mer trustee/employee relationships and whistle-blowers, plus attempts to 
get around the rules. But these discussions often don’t include the issue of 
personal feelings and benefits, even though the emphasis of the discussion is 
“what’s in it for me?” Most would say that doing those things in the above list 
are unethical and that they do not advantage the organization or the fund, but 
what if they did? If a board member accepted a “gift” for bringing an invest-
ment to the board, and the investment was truly in the fund’s interest, would 
it be unethical? We would have a hard time saying out of hand that either the 
investment tout doing the giving or the board member doing the receiving 
were being unethical. It probably would be situational depending on the mem-
ber’s prior expectation as well as the size of the gift. Although not knowing 
the difference between accepting a trip to Paris and accepting a box of candy, 
or a bottle of Two Buck Chuck, may mean you need a new board member.  
A muffin at a morning meeting? Let’s not be silly.
One organization fired a long-time manager that they were happy with and 
who was doing a great job. They replaced him with a firm with a much higher 
profile only to gain that higher profile. Unethical? If they did it for status to 
benefit themselves at the club and to be able to say “we use such and such,” 
then very much so. It was discovered that the new group had ties to members 
on the board that were undisclosed. This failure to disclose, I would have to 
say, is the definition of unethical. Ethics aside, we would also say that this was 
definitely a breach of their fiduciary duty of loyalty to the institution.
We can look at a case study to see many of these issues and conflicts at play. 
A foundation adds a new member to its investment committee who also  
happens to be on the investment committee of a large national organization. 
The national organization uses a particular investment advisor, and the new 
member advocates strongly for that manager. The foundation’s investment 

Chapter 3 | Ethics
14
officer does the diligence and finds several significant and serious issues that 
should keep the foundation from investing and strongly recommends passing. 
At the new member’s insistence, that manager is hired. It turned out bad.
Without ascribing bad intent to the new member, what could have been the 
ethical issues? What about the ethics of the other members? What about the 
fiduciary issues? What was the ethical dilemma of the new member? Should 
he have introduced the investment manager to the foundation? From both 
an ethical and fiduciary point of view, we would say that of course he should 
have made the introduction. Should he have participated in discussion and the 
voting? He probably should not partake in the discussion, and certainly should 
not vote.
What about the duties of the other members? Did the new guy have a better 
understanding of the manager? Did they have an obligation to listen to their 
designated expert, the CIO? Should the names of the money manager’s other 
clients matter? Did they have an obligation to take into consideration the  
relationship between the new member and the money manager? Should they 
ask why the new guy pushed the investment manager so hard? Was it just  
a simple mistake, or hubris on the part of the new member or leading from 
behind on the part of the other members of the foundation’s investment 
committee?
If the recommendation of the investment officer was accepted and no 
investment was made, then what was the new guy’s duty to his national 
organization? If he had negative information, should he pass it along to that 
national organization? What did this do to his prior acceptance vote at that 
organization? Should his responsibility to the other organization affect his 
conduct at the foundation? Was the information at the national organization 
higher in the food chain and therefore better because of the “brand?” Did he 
see his position of authority as somehow lessened by not pushing his view? 
Whatever the specifics, we should all see a mix of both fiduciary and ethical 
issues with no easy answers. The difficulty in writing a rule that encompasses 
all of these factors is that it does not affect the knock-on events, which then 
makes writing an effective rule impossible.
To our thinking, the new guy should have brought the investment manager 
to the committee. It would have been a shirking of his fiduciary duty not to. 
The committee should have discussed each of the questions and issues listed 
above without regard to the national organization’s decision to hire this manager. 
Then, since the diligence done by the CIO brought to light serious and signifi-
cant issues, those issues should also have been discussed which most probably, 
would have led to the institution not hiring the advisor. The new guy would 
then have both a fiduciary and ethical duty to his other organization to relay 
the negative information to them.

So far the discussion has focused on acts committed, but what about acts 
omitted? An investment committee member uses a particular money manager 
but doesn’t bring that manager to the committee because he feels that push-
ing a private agenda is not ethical, and is somehow a conflict of interest. It 
seems obvious that because he continues to use the manager that he believes 
is “good,” he has done a certain amount of diligence and there is the possibility 
that this manager can help the institution’s fund. Is not telling the committee 
about a possible advantage really ethical? Here we are confronted not with 
doing but with not doing. It is definitely not acting as an advocate for the fund 
and it is not being loyal to the fund, but is it ethical to withhold? “Not harm-
ing” is a central point in both ethics and acting as a fiduciary, so one could use 
the greater harm rule to decide to act or to not act. We believe one should 
surface the name and then step out of the discussion and decision.
Ethics goes, as we have seen, well beyond a list of things that are objectively 
right and things wrong in all cases. No matter how big a list of rules, one can’t 
lop off or stretch every event to fit the rule. Ethics are situational and are 
dependent on the reason for whatever action or inaction taken. It requires 
a hard look at one’s self and an ability to know if the action is really in the 
best interests of the organization, or one that caters to selfish reasons. Not 
an easy task.

Essentials  
of Governance
Governance delineates the functions that decision-makers are assigned to 
perform, provides those decision-makers with the authority to execute 
those functions, and gives someone the tools to monitor those decisions. 
While there are four primary governance models for investment funds, within 
each model there can be many variations, and the different sets of actors 
(­decision-makers) will play varying roles from organization to organization. 
The governing oversight also varies from model to model (we discuss these 
models in the next chapter).
In any business, setting a “road map” for how an organization will ­navigate the 
challenges ahead is a critical component to the overall success of the organi-
zation. This is particularly true within the investment management business. 
Fortunately, a governing document provides that road map. By ­definition, 
governance is the overall system by which an organization is ­managed, 
directed, controlled, and monitored. Although all institutional investors 
are using some form of governance, it’s worth revisiting what exemplifies a  
successful governance culture and why good governance is important to an 
institutional investor.
Strong governance demonstrates to the stakeholders that their assets are 
not only in good hands, but that internal controls and policies align with the 
investment objectives of the fund. Leadership, transparency, core competen-
cies, and a strong moral and ethical compass are all required characteristics 
of a strong governing body. Boards that exhibit these types of traits are much 
more likely to meet their investment objectives and goals than organizations 
that do not.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 4 | Essentials of Governance 
18
Leadership can be evidenced through the establishment of strong policies 
and procedures that meet your organization’s goals and not someone else’s; 
Procrustes does not rule. Leadership is an essential element of governance. 
The policies and procedures essential to strong leadership are discussed in 
later chapters.
Transparency is another aspect of strong governance. Transparency is a simple 
concept, yet many organizations fail to properly implement it. Although you 
will not be able to share every single detail of your investment program, and 
rightfully so, increased transparency typically leads to increased accountability, 
and that accountability is also essential. By making your governance docu-
ments publicly available, your organization is demonstrating your willingness 
to be held accountable to your stakeholders. Fortunately, there are organiza-
tions that understand the importance of transparency, and how vital it is to a 
successful governance model.
Being knowledgeable and skilled is an integral part of executing your duties as 
a fiduciary. You can export some of that responsibility to knowledgeable and 
skilled professionals, or you can acquire that knowledge and skill yourself. For 
many, outside expertise is the wisest decision, but the rest of this book is here 
to help if you choose not to use professional help.
Within the actual governance plan and the document that describes it, there 
are a handful of key decision-makers or entities that will play a role in the 
management of investments. The inclusion and composition of these key play-
ers will differ from organization to organization, and it’s likely that not all of 
the key players will be integrated into your own management plan. However, 
there are some that will be frequently seen in most programs.
Board
Successful governance requires strong leadership from the board. The board 
defines lines of authority and establishes roles and responsibilities. It also  
provides strategic direction for the organization and, most importantly, bears 
ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the investment program.
As I mentioned, the makeup of the board will vary to some degree, as size, 
complexity, and resources available to an organization will dictate its composi-
tion. In general, it will include individuals who have diverse work experiences 
and backgrounds. Most have an understanding of the organization’s obligations 
and objectives, and an interest in the purpose of the organization. They may 
or may not have core competencies in the investment of funds for a founda-
tion or endowment, and therefore may or may not need to delegate some of 
those activities.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
19
Ultimately, the board carries the responsibility of determining the most appro-
priate governing structure (more on this later), instituting lines of authority, 
establishing roles and responsibilities of both trustees and staff, delegating 
tasks, hiring or terminating key staff and/or outside service providers, and 
monitoring and evaluating all of these effectively.
With final discretion as to “how” the investment program will be carried out 
and how the governance structure is established, the board will spend a fair 
amount of time up front determining who the other key decision-makers 
will be and how tasks and responsibilities will be delegated. (Delegation is 
almost always required.) This includes decisions on whether or not to create 
an investment committee, hire an outside investment consultant, establish an 
internal investment officer and staff, or contract with an external investment 
office. These decisions are not one-time occurrences, and a “set it and forget 
it” attitude will not be successful. Instead, these decisions and discussions 
must be made on a regular basis. Even though the road might appear to be 
straight, the path will alter and change; the board must be flexible and open 
enough to alter its course when a detour is needed, because ultimately the 
buck stops with the board.
Investment Committee
The board can elect to delegate some of its duties and create a separate  
committee to oversee the investment program. This is oftentimes due to a 
lack of skill or time. Those boards that have other things to do at their infre-
quent meetings, boards that are large, or have little investment knowledge 
find that delegating to a committee tasked with only investments is helpful, if 
not essential. If the board elects to take this route, a number of responsibili-
ties can be handed over to the investment committee. Broadly speaking, they 
will consist of developing the investment procedures and perhaps even the  
policies surrounding them. For board approval, of course.
The governance documents of the fund include not only a description of 
governance policy but also the policies and procedures used for investing. 
As a matter of practice, if the board creates an investment committee they 
also delegate the task of creating the entire governance document, including 
investment policy, to that committee. This document is important, and will be 
discussed in greater detail in a later chapter, but essentially it specifies how 
the funds will be managed, describes how they are evaluated, and establishes 
the investment objectives.
After both governance and investment policies have been established, the 
investment committee will then implement these policies. Implementation 
can be done through the investment committee in its entirety, through  
an individual (the CFO, perhaps), a consultant, an external investment office 

Chapter 4 | Essentials of Governance 
20
or an internal investment office. With these potential combinations (running 
from least effective to most effective), it is apparent that the implementation 
of the investment policy can and will differ from organization to organization 
depending on the roles and results desired, which we will discuss later. 
CFO / Treasurer
The CFO plays an important role within the investment program. Typically, 
the CFO monitors the overall finances, liquidity, cash flows and audits of the 
organization. For an investment committee however, they are also often, and 
maybe should be, held responsible for the execution of documents as an inter-
nal control and as a best practice. This includes executing limited partnership 
agreements, custodial agreements, and external providers’ contracts.
Many foundations and endowments add to a CFO’s duties a collateral duty 
to function as the CIO. This works only if there is not much in the way of 
accounting during the year, and if there is a way to provide adequate internal 
controls, except of course during the audit or budget cycles, when there is no 
time for investments. One can only hope there is no need to manage invest-
ments for that period of time. It would not be a successful internal control nor 
would it be a best practice to have the CFO also function as the CIO. While it 
may be fun for the CFO, and could perhaps save the organization a few dollars 
by not hiring a separate investment officer, it costs significantly more in lost 
investment opportunity and increased risks. 
Internal Investment Office
An investment office is primarily responsible for implementing the ­investment 
program independently, or with guidance from the investment committee. 
The office or officer would be responsible for performing investment ­manager 
due diligence, investigating new asset classes, allocating assets, ­reporting 
­performance, and reporting to the investment committee. An internal 
­investment officer often has varying levels of discretion, depending on the 
amount of control the board is willing to relinquish. It is a best practice for 
the investment officer to have discretion within broad guidelines with ­specific 
evaluation points, and for the investment committee to monitor those closely. 
In a situation where the internal investment officer does have complete  
discretion, portfolio performance falls directly on the shoulders of the 
­investment officer, exporting some of the skill requirements from the board 
to that individual. Making the CIO responsible and accountable facilitates an 
environment of professionalism and gives the board a second tool with which 
to manage. We recommend an internal office and staff for funds able and  
willing to afford the added personnel.

Investment Consultant
Investment consultants are an interesting bunch, and certainly a common, if 
not always helpful, option. Depending on the firm and experience level of the 
individual investment consultant, they can engage in a wide variety of activities, 
including formulating an investment policy statement, performing investment 
manager due diligence and offering recommendations, selecting asset classes, 
providing reporting, and delivering unbiased and objective advice. One of the 
truly interesting aspects of an investment consultant is their position within 
the industry. Investment consultants are widely considered in the industry 
to be “gatekeepers” due to their large presence and the fact that they are 
positioned as middlemen between the fund and investment managers. It’s well 
known that investment managers spend an inordinate amount of time with 
consultants in the hopes that the consultant will elect to put that manager on 
their platform, which in turn helps the investment manager raise assets.
For small institutions, investment consultants are essential to “stepping-up” their 
programs. Consultants are able to provide the board with an investment skill set 
that brings added professionalism and experience to the process. In a general 
sense, though, investment consultants are most likely to help an organization 
formulate an investment policy statement and offer reporting solutions to the 
board. A traditional investment consultant is unlikely to make specific manager 
recommendations and instead will suggest a handful of investment managers 
(three or four) that fit some predetermined criteria (large cap value, small cap 
growth , etc.), on which the fund must decide. For that reason, it’s extremely 
difficult for investment consultants to deliver the accountability, in terms of 
performance, that is expected of an internal or contracted investment office. 
This is one of the key differentiators between an internal investment office, a 
contracted investment office, and an investment consultant.
Investment consultants have another common function (especially with the 
public pension set). They are targets to which the board can point and bellow 
“Off with his head!” when challenged. 
Contracted Investment Office
The contracted or shared investment office is similar to an internal invest-
ment office. They can be given little discretion or total discretion. I think the 
best practice is to mirror what the fund would have liked to receive from an 
internal office. Like an internal investment office, a contracted office provides 
the professionalism, responsibility and accountability that shoulder much of 
the fiduciary responsibilities of the board. This is not an “outsourced CIO,” as 
it is commonly thought of in the industry. Rather than a product provider, a 
contracted investment office is more like a contracted employee.

Chapter 4 | Essentials of Governance 
22
A contracted investment office is responsible for implementing the investment 
program independently, or with guidance from the investment committee. 
The office or officer would be responsible for performing managerial due 
­diligence, investigating new asset classes, allocating assets, reporting perfor-
mance, and reporting to the investment committee. It is a best practice for the 
investment officer to have discretion within broad guidelines with specific 
evaluation points, and for the investment committee to monitor those closely. 
In a situation where the contracted investment officer does have complete 
discretion, portfolio performance falls directly on the shoulders of the invest-
ment officer, exporting some of the skill requirements from the board to that 
individual. Making the CIO responsible and accountable facilitates an environ-
ment of professionalism and gives the board a second tool with which to 
manage. 

The Governance 
Document 
The Investment Policy Statement
This is the time for special care. It is so easy, being unfamiliar with writing a 
governance document, to simply get someone else’s and copy. The thinking is 
that if it is good enough for them, it must be good enough for us. Trying to 
fit your organization into someone else’s iron frame is a big mistake, and can 
make all the difference between success and failure. This document is uniquely 
yours, your governance, your goals, your risks, and your process. The effort to 
think through and write a unique document is the main reason for the gover-
nance plan. A secondary reason is to memorialize the development process 
results so that your investment committee and board will hold to the plan 
rather than ad hoc decisions. The governance document also exists to inform 
and educate new members as they come along so that the plan has legs and 
remains long-term. This is not to say it can’t be changed, but changes should 
come infrequently, and not as an emotional reaction to every stress point.
Writing this governance document and investment policy statement after 
thought and discussion gives it weight and understanding, while pulling out 
someone else’s means that the document and its contents are not all that 
important and are there just to paper the file. Not having one or having one 
of little importance means that at each juncture decisions are made with 
emotion rather than deliberate and unhurried care.
The investment policy statement or governance document is an integral 
component of the investment program because it lays the groundwork for 
the investment program and provides clear instructions and guidelines for 
implementation. An investment policy statement also articulates what roles 
5
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 5 | The Governance Document 
24
and responsibilities each party will have within the investment program. An 
effective investment policy will cover the major elements of philosophy and 
process; truly a plan for governance.
Return Objectives
Best practices indicate that an institution should articulate the primary goal 
or goals of the organization’s investable assets, and what types of returns are 
needed to achieve those goals. Additionally, the board should determine what 
the appropriate time horizon is to achieve those goals, as well as how they 
plan to measure and monitor progress.
In many standard boilerplate investment policy statements, there is a tendency 
to create return goals that are relative in nature, whether to other funds, 
markets, inflation or, most commonly, to some sort of “policy” index. While 
it’s nice to know that you beat your rival, or are better than average, you can-
not spend relatives. The problem is that the fund is supposed to provide some 
cash money. That’s the way checks are written—for grants, for budget support 
or to pay retirement benefits. Therefore, your return objective should be an 
absolute number.
Many funds are perpetual in nature; so, should your investment horizon be 
“forever?” We’d like to think our fund will last into perpetuity, but need to 
be realistic “forever” is just not going to happen.. More commonly we hear 
a three- to five-year time horizon, but is that realistic? I believe the best 
approach is the one used in both the pension and insurance industries, where 
the time horizon is based on your expenditure needs (liabilities). This would 
mean you have multiple and rolling horizons. For example, one organization 
had a short-term need for a return of 9% to support their budget during a 
long-term construction effort. But they also wanted to have as much in their 
fund at the end of the construction plus two years, (for a total of 14 years) as 
they had at the beginning, which meant a long-term return of 11%. They used 
a rolling three-year return of 9% and a fixed time that ended 14 years in the 
future as their goals. 
Risk Tolerance
The organization needs to define risk and its own appetite for taking risk in 
order to accomplish its goals. Contrary to the belief of almost every academic 
or consultant, risk is not a standard deviation. Risk is the danger of not meeting 
your financial and non-financial goals. We will discuss risk in much more detail 
in a later chapter, but for now, note that it is the chance (probability) of some 
bad thing happening. Defining risk is defining that bad thing—loss of capital, a 
return below some number, not having enough for a construction project—
and the probability associated with failing.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
25
For example, one institution defined risk as a minimum percentage of return 
on average as an absolute, plus a second (higher and less absolute) return num-
ber that would allow a particular construction project. Once risk is defined, 
the organization can establish the appropriate risk metrics to measure such 
risk—is it volatility, probability of loss, drawdown, or purchasing power loss?
Asset Allocation
While asset allocation is best left to your investment officer, those organizations 
that have chosen not to use one will need to determine which asset classes the 
investment program will include and exclude. Asset classes that can be consid-
ered are: equities (U.S., emerging markets, global, MLPs, REITs, commodities 
international); fixed income (treasuries, corporates, high yield, distressed debt, 
mezzanine, emerging markets, mortgage-backed securities, CLOs, collateral 
debt obligations, collateral mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-
backed securities); and alternatives (long/short equity, multi-strategy hedge 
funds, fund of funds, venture capital, growth equity, levered buyouts, commod-
ity trading advisors, managed futures, macro hedge funds, and the list goes on). 
As the list of financial products continues to grow, an organization should only 
venture into those asset classes for which they have the necessary expertise 
to understand the risks and benefits.
It is common and traditional (if 30 years can be called a tradition) to set 
a target allocation and then create ranges around those targets. The ques-
tions to ask are why those asset classes were chosen, and where the target  
allocation numbers and the ranges around them came from. Did they come in  
a dream, or do they simply feel good? Are you using someone else’s? Why a 
certain percentage for domestic equity and not another? The most common 
approach is to just use someone else’s, but, that is a big mistake. For example, a 
well-known university uses 10% as a target allocation for six different classes, 
and 40% for hedge funds. Come on really? Can they find that many really 
good hedge funds? Aside: they rank in the bottom few universities and their 
investment committee has some of the best resumes in the country. There is 
an old saw about what you step in if you are following the herd. We’ll revisit 
asset allocation in a separate chapter. 
Rebalancing Protocol
Portfolio rebalancing is a component of the portfolio management process, 
and again should be delegated to the investment officer. For those boards 
that choose to do it themselves, the rebalancing policy should describe how 
they plan to rebalance the portfolio, including methodology and rationale. 
There are a number of rebalancing techniques for organizations, but the most 
common are calendar, corridor ranges, and tactical asset allocation. Calendar 

Chapter 5 | The Governance Document 
26
rebalancing is as simple as it sounds—every so many months, quarters  
or other pre-determined time interval, the portfolio is adjusted back to the 
original target allocation. Corridor ranges allow asset classes to trade within 
a band, and the portfolio will be rebalanced back to the original allocation  
only after an asset class breaches the asset  allocation range. These asset  
allocation ranges are set based on several things including (unfortunately) 
how the board or investment committee feels. Tactical asset allocation allows 
for more flexibility, but skeptics believe it’s a strategy designed to “time” the 
market. Specifically, tactical asset allocation allows an institution to take 
advantage of asset classes that are perceived to be undervalued relative to 
other opportunities, or, in some iterations, what’s hot. Some institutions use 
systematic tactical asset allocation strategies, where a quantitative investment 
model (black box) is used to systematically exploit inefficiencies or temporary 
imbalances among different asset classes.
Portfolio Evaluation – Benchmarking
Whatever benchmark you write down will become the goal that the invest-
ment committee, the consultant and the investment officer will manage to—in 
order to exceed and win—win congratulations, commissions or bonuses. If 
you pay your yard guy by the hour, the work will take all day; if instead you pay 
by the job, don’t blink or you’ll miss him.
A successful investment policy will establish the definition of success— 
success for you, not someone else. Then, through metrics designed to measure 
progress to that goal, real measurement and subsequent evaluation can take 
place. In advance of making a particular investment, an appropriate benchmark 
should be determined so that the underlying investment can be monitored 
and evaluated over the life of the investment.
A portfolio benchmark, in the form of an absolute return and not a custom-
ized benchmark (policy index), should be established after portfolio goals have 
been defined. The investment policy statement should also elaborate on which 
time periods will weigh more heavily for evaluation purposes, harking back 
to the investment horizons already established. Frequent review will permit 
the discovery of rapidly developing issues and the large amount of data will 
permit identification of slower trends. A well-thought-out portfolio evalua-
tion process can protect investors from some of the irrational behavior that 
plagues both institutional and retail investors—namely, overreaction during 
large market downturns.

Governance 
Structures
When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?
—John Maynard Keynes
The issues we have so far discussed and their implementation are all  
subject to the structure of governance you select. Surprisingly, the structure 
you select is highly predictive of your success. While there isn’t a “one size 
fits all” governance structure, we will focus on four primary models that are in 
vogue with many institutions and discuss a few variations within each model.
The first and simplest model is what we will call the DIY Model. In this model 
the board, or a subset of the board (the investment committee or even the 
CFO), manages, governs, and makes all investment-related decisions. This 
model is suited for organizations with straightforward investment objectives 
and policies, and minimal assets (less than $10 million).
The second governance model is the Traditional Model, where the board or 
another entity (e.g., the investment committee or CFO) will supplement 
their work with an investment consultant. As an institution’s size and the 
­complexity of the investment strategy increases, institutions often look for 
additional help with their investments, and hiring an investment consultant is 
a common solution.
A third governance structure, the Internal Model, is where the governing body 
works in tandem with internal investment staff to carry out the mission of the 
organization.
6
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 6 | Governance Structures
28
The fourth and final governance model we will call the Contracted Model. Here, 
the governing body works with a contracted external investment team. The 
contracted investment office is responsible for all the same tasks that an inter-
nal investment office normally would do. The only obvious difference is they 
share some of their time with a small number of other clients. This would be 
called “outsourcing” in just about any other industry, but in the institutional 
investment world, the word “outsourcing” is used differently.
Depending on the complexity of the organization and investment program, 
and size of assets, each governance structure can incorporate many commit-
tees and individuals that play a role within the structure. For example, an orga-
nization that is implementing the Internal Model, which relies on an in-house 
investment officer, can also employ an investment consultant or contracted 
investment office if desired, based on the investment officer’s skills and scope. 
These decisions on how to structure the governance model, and in particular 
how roles and responsibilities will be delegated, are an important responsibil-
ity of the board.
Ultimately, the success or failure of an investment program will fall on the 
board, so getting the right players onto the board and structures in place 
is critical. There are obviously many decisions a board must make while 
­constructing their governance structure. Some of these decisions include 
which groups or committees should be established, who will take on each 
responsibility, what level of involvement each group will encounter, and how 
the committee will be constructed. To further illustrate this point, the follow-
ing are a series of tables (one for each governance model) that illustrates the 
potential groups and individuals that are necessary within each model, which 
groups and individuals are optional, and the expected level of involvement for 
the various participants.

Irrespective of which committees and groups the board ultimately elects 
to include, the board must clearly declare the governance purpose for each 
body to ensure all roles, responsibilities and authorities are established well in 
advance. Any and all changes must be clearly communicated to all participants 
and decision-makers.

Chapter 6 | Governance Structures

In the proceeding sections, we will discuss each of the governance models in 
further detail. Specifically, we will discuss how the chain of command can and 
ought to be structured, the key decision-makers within each model, the roles 
and responsibilities for various decision makers, and the benefits and short-
comings of each governance model.

The simplest and most basic governance structure is the DIY Model. In this 
particular structure, and as the name suggests, the board opts to be the sole 
decision-making body. As such, an increased amount of time must be spent by 
the board on investment-related decisions.
DIY Model Structure
Being the sole and ultimate decision-maker, the board has a number of issues 
and responsibilities that must be ironed out. Highest on their priority list is 
formulating an investment policy. Secondarily, they must determine how to 
implement the policy. The board must decide who will lead the efforts, and 
how they (internally) will hold one another accountable. Other ­discussions  
the board must consider are: Who will be responsible for performing

­investment manager due diligence? How will asset allocation targets be estab-
lished? What liquidity is needed? What asset classes are investable? Who will 
be the custodian? Who will be the broker? How will best execution amongst 
brokers (implicit vs. explicit costs) be monitored? How will the board handle 
large market swings? Will the board tilt the portfolio to take advantage of 
market opportunities? Who will furnish performance reports? How often 
will ­performance reports be produced? How is risk being defined (volatility, 
­probability of failure, drawdown, etc.)? What will spark a change in ­investments? 
Will external investment managers be used? Will the money be managed 
­internally? How will future cash flows impact the portfolio? How often will the 
portfolio be monitored? Who will offer tax guidance? What is the ­appropriate 
time horizon? What legal or bond covenants must be considered?
Although the above list isn’t all-inclusive, it should be fairly apparent that the 
number of potential issues and responsibilities that must be accounted for 
could cause an unnecessary burden on the board.
For smaller institutions, or institutions with a board unwilling to relinquish 
control, that want one or perhaps two mutual funds, or maybe just want 
to leave the money with the bank or someone’s personal stock broker, this 
may be functional but not necessarily a “best practice.” If the institution 
has a ­limited asset base (less than $10 million) and a fairly straightforward 
­investment program (perhaps all the money is at the bank), this governance 
structure may make sense, but if not, it’s likely an alternative structure would 
be a wiser fiduciary solution. For a fund that is sizeable or complex, the board 
may in fact be doing their institution a disservice by doing it themselves.
One of the main issues with the DIY governance model is time. Board mem-
bers already have a finite amount of time, and the additional responsibilities 
that are required to manage the investment portfolio only add to their work-
load. The board can elect to set up a separate committee (an investment 
committee) to help with establishing investment policies and implementation, 
although, again, the onus still falls on the organization to establish and execute 
policy.
Implementation is time-consuming, and monitoring a portfolio on a quarterly 
basis as opposed to daily can leave it vulnerable. One of the most ­important 
value-adds that external advisors bring is their resources, specifically the 
time that is needed to proactively screen money managers, evaluate various 
investment opportunities, research asset classes, and monitor the risk of the 
portfolio.
Another drawback of the DIY Model is investment knowledge, or lack thereof. 
Even though there may be some trustees who have some personal ­investment 
experience, managing an entire portfolio (across multiple asset classes) is 

Chapter 6 | Governance Structures
32
vastly different than managing a stock portfolio or personal 401k plan. Time 
is still another issue. Based on your institution’s own circumstances, if you 
believe implementing the DIY Model gives your institution the best chance for 
success, you should ensure that your board meetings do not turn into invest-
ment club meetings. Instead, roles and responsibilities should be assigned to 
different members prior to discussing investments. For example, the chair-
man of the board should set the meeting agenda to include items such as 
evaluation of the managers, fund performance, rebalancing activities, and any 
suggested changes to the portfolio. To minimize groupthink, the governing 
body should consist of five to seven members, with varying backgrounds and 
skill sets. Members should have term limits to ensure fresh ideas are being 
discussed and evaluated. For an institution implementing the DIY Model, the 
board must be cognizant of the fiduciary role they assume as actors on behalf 
of their institution, particularly their role in developing and executing invest-
ment policy. Overseeing implementation of the investment policy is one of the 
largest challenges facing a board that chooses to use the DIY Model. Unless 
your investment program is simple, and your investable assets are less than 
$10 million, it’s our belief that you’d be better served employing an alterna-
tive governance structure, given the amount of time and resources that are 
required to manage the investment program.

Although some organizations would argue the Traditional Model is a bit dated 
(and I would agree), the Traditional Model does provide for an outside 
­perspective and added resources. Using a Traditional Model, an organization 
will work with an investment consultant, whose main task is to act as an 
external advisor establishing and implementing the investment policy. While 
an investment committee is not a requirement within this governance 
­structure, most organizations will typically set up a committee to help ­monitor 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
33
the investment consultant, enabling the board time to focus on strategy and 
policy decisions as opposed to investment implementation decisions.
Traditional Model Structure
George Russell, founder of Russell investments, pioneered the Traditional 
Model when, in 1969, he made a pitch to J.C. Penny to demonstrate the value 
of money manager evaluation. During his conversation with J.C. Penny, he 
convinced them that there was indeed value in evaluating and recommending 
money managers, and J.C. Penny in turn agreed to hire him (his first pension 
fund consulting client).
Over the past forty five years or so, the industry has changed dramatically. 
Historically, investment consultants, working in conjunction with the govern-
ing body, provided unbiased opinions regarding asset classes and manager 
selection; the service George Russell pitched to J.C. Penny. Today, though, 
it’s extremely difficult to categorize all investment consultants as the same 
because their roles, responsibilities, and business models have evolved over 
time. In 2005, the SEC described the activities of investment consultants as: 
(1) identifying investment objectives and restrictions; (2) allocating plan assets 
to various objectives; (3) selecting money managers to manage plan assets in 
ways designed to achieve objectives; (4) selecting mutual funds that plan par-
ticipants can choose as their funding vehicles; (5) monitoring performance of 
money managers and mutual funds and making recommendations for changes; 
and (6) selecting other service providers, such as custodians, administrators 
and broker-dealers, showing the wide range of services offered by consultants. 
This enables the governing body to seek out only those investment consul-
tants who can effectively meet their needs.
Investment consultants often help organizations establish their investment  
policy, which is done through the creation of an investment policy ­statement.  
The investment consultant addresses return objectives, risk tolerance, accept-
able asset classes, and portfolio rebalancing tactics when creating the policy 
statement. An investment consultant could also assist in the ­implementation 
stage, including help with investment manager due diligence, perfor-
mance reporting, target asset allocation, and guidelines for asset allocation 
rebalancing.

While most consultants may offer investment manager due diligence and per-
formance-reporting services, there are few who will make an actual hire-or-fire 
decision as it pertains to money managers. For that reason, many institutions 
operating with the Traditional Model still must rely on the governing body to 
implement the investment strategy by hiring and firing managers, implement-
ing asset allocation decisions, and rebalancing. This, like the DIY Model, puts 
the responsibility for performance back in the hands of the governing body. 
This is one of the main pitfalls of investment consultants; some have described 
the role of a consultant as an “insurance policy.”
This shouldn’t come as a shock, because as their name implies, investment 
consultants do just what is expected—they consult. They offer multiple 
investment managers when presenting a particular investment idea to avoid 
accountability, and are often anything but transparent. The accountability and 
transparency issues (or lack thereof), has recently gained traction within the 
investment community. In fact, it was even highlighted by Andrew Kirton, global 
chief investment officer at Mercer. Mr. Kirton was quoted in September 2013 
in Pensions & Investments magazine, saying “It’s in our clients’ interest to have 
the level of transparency that we have [none]. We’re not forced by marketing 
purposes to give advice we think isn’t in their best interest due to polishing 
numbers that makes us look better in a survey.” Definitely a rationalization of 
hiding how well they do or don’t do their jobs.
Lack of performance track records and poor performance are reasons so 
many institutions are looking for help elsewhere. Dr. Howard Jones and his 
colleagues, Professor Tim Jenkinson and Dr. Jose Vicente Martinez of Oxford 
University, examined the recommendations of investment consultants from 
1999 to 2011 to determine whether or not they added value to a portfolio’s 
performance adjusted for risk. According to Dr. Jones, “The analysis finds no 
evidence that the recommendations of the investment consultant for these 
U.S. equity products enabled investors to outperform their benchmarks or 
generate alpha.”1 The study found that, on average, the consultants’ recom-
mendations underperformed their benchmarks by about one percent. Lack of 
performance track record, or an underwhelming track record, is not the only 
drawback to the Traditional Model.
Another major drawback is the numerous conflicts of interest that exist 
between investment consultants and investment managers. A study by Jay 
Youngdahl of Harvard University, “Investment Consultants and Institutional 
Corruption,” addressed some of these conflicts of interest and other issues 
surrounding investment consultants. He found that, due to investment

Consultants’ Recommendations of Fund Managers,” Journal of Finance, Forthcoming (2014),

­consultants’ position within the industry, they at times can and will collude 
with investment managers whereby the investment managers are recom-
mended to the organization and in return the investment manager provides 
some remuneration for the consultant’s recommendation. Because so many 
institutions use investment consultants as their de-facto investment expert, 
investment consultants have increasingly gained power through the accumula-
tion of clients and assets. This in turn makes them especially important from 
the vantage point of an investment manager, because they are the gatekeepers 
to the institutions who are the true asset owners. Therefore, it’s not uncom-
mon to see investment managers wine, dine, send gifts, or offer free retreats 
to investment consultants.
That’s not to say the Traditional Model is entirely bad or that all investment 
consultants are corrupt. The Traditional Model does add an additonal layer 
of oversight and provides (perceived) safety to those board members that 
are worried about being fiduciaries. The most sought-after service offered 
by investment consultants is their managerial due diligence, often embodied 
by a platform of managers. A manager platform is a repository of investment 
­managers that the investment consultant has already vetted and evaluated at 
the same level of diligence. The investment managers who occupy the consul-
tant’s manager platform are currently being recommended to clients by the 
consultant. Each manager platform is different; some managers might be on 
the platform to fit a specific style box (e.g., large cap value, large cap growth, 
mid cap value, mid cap growth), while others might be on the platform because 
of the investment type (fixed income, private equity, hedge fund). Being on a 
platform is highly lucrative for the manager and reduces the consultant’s need 
to spend time or money on the diligence of many different managers.

Contracted Model Structure
Contracted investment offices have been used for years because of their 
­flexibility and the customized nature of their service. Unlike investment 
­consultants, for whom economies of scale lead to their own business ­success, 
contracted investment offices are successful for their member clients when 
working with a handful of clients. This leads to a much higher level of client 
service, more customized solutions, and advocacy for the fund that is not com-
monly found in the Traditional Model. The business is all about the client.
A fairly recent phenomenon is the increased use of contracted investment 
office in conjunction with an internal investment office. More public and ­private 
pension plans are seeking the expertise of a contracted investment officer not 
found with the in-house investment office. They leave the investment part 
mostly to the contract office and use the in-house office to interface with the 
stakeholders. It’s not uncommon for an internal investment office to be run 
by an executive director and to not be fully equipped with the skill sets that 
span the spectrum of investments.
In terms of structuring a Contracted Model, an organization has two  
basic options. One is to work directly with the contracted investment office 
(most common), and the other is to outsource a portion of the investment 
program to the contracted investment office while simultaneously keeping the 
rest in-house with the internal investment office.
One of the main draws of the Contracted Models that contracted ­investment 
offices can work with varying levels of discretion and fiduciary roles. 
Specifically, contracted investment offices are able to help organizations in 
a similar ­capacity as an internal investment office. This includes assisting not 
only in meeting the return objectives, but also with developing funding require-
ments, cash-flow needs, volatility concerns, audit support, and sometimes even 
­corporate finance decisions.

Working with a varying level of discretion depending on the board’s pref-
erences, the contracted investment office can develop an investment policy 
statement, implement the investment program, perform investment manager 
due diligence, make asset allocation recommendations, establish risk metrics, 
create performance reports, conduct research on various asset classes, assist 
in audit support, review all limited partnership agreements, advise on custodial 
and brokerage accounts, monitor liquidity, and tilt the portfolio given various 
market opportunities.
Institutions that can’t afford, or choose not to afford, to use an internal office 
are able to replicate an internal investment office at a fraction of the cost. 
Institutions chose this approach because they can get experienced and highly 
productive investors at a reasonable cost.

The only real difference between the Internal Model and the Contracted 
Model is that the investment office is internal, with actual employees rather 
than contract employees. This internal investment office would include a chief 
investment officer and perhaps a staff, although that’s not a requirement. The 
internal investment office would manage all the day-to-day nuances of the 
investment management program, including manager performance, invest-
ment manager due diligence, asset allocations, portfolio tilts, portfolio risk, 
and liquidity.

This internal structure allows the board and investment committee the time 
required to focus on oversight. Oversight includes constructing reasonable 
evaluation metrics so the internal investment office is held accountable for 
their investment decisions. In conjunction with the internal investment office, 
the governing body needs to set the investment policies at the onset of the 
investment program, so that the risk and return objectives are defined and 
established. Another decision is discretion. Investment discretion, in any of 
the governance models, is not necessarily black and white; it’s more likely to 
be a shade of gray. Internal investment offices can work with varying levels of 
discretion, but this should be established well in advance so there are no ques-
tions as to who holds accountability for investment performance. Delegating 
full autonomy and discretion to the internal investment office places the 
accountability solely on the internal investment office. This accountability 
allows the governing body to quickly implement change if the internal invest-
ment office is not pulling their weight.
The only shortcoming of the Internal Model is cost. According to some in 
the industry, it isn’t economically feasible to have an internal investment office 
until an organization reaches $2 billion or so in assets, and becomes a neces-
sity after about $5 billion. Cost alone, or even assets, shouldn’t determine the 
direction the board takes; control and perhaps secrecy are other factors. 
As one of many variations on a theme, the Internal Model can also incorpo-
rate an investment consultant or contracted investment office in situations 
where (1) the governing body is looking for additional data points; (2) costs 
are an issue and hiring additional staff is a political nightmare; and (3) the inter-
nal investment office doesn’t have the skill set or expertise in specialized areas 
such as hedge funds, private equity, or the like.
Recap
The Internal Model is the gold standard, and its success is dependent on the 
quality of the individuals employed. Cost is the factor most at issue for a 
board; can they, or are they willing to, afford one and its corollary: can they 
pay enough to get experience? Following that closely is the Contracted Model, 
which has nearly the same advantages as the Internal Model at a fraction of 
the cost. It is slightly less—an advocate and needs slightly more supervision. 
Because their use is observable in increased portfolio returns and in board 
satisfaction, these are the models we favor.

So what makes a good investment committee? Good investment committees 
debate issues and make recommendations that are framed openly and trans-
parently. As Catherine D. Gordon and Karin Peterson LaBarge of Vanguard 
wrote in May 2010 in “Investment Committees: Vanguard’s View of Best 
Practices,” the best investment committee practices are:
1.	 Establish an explicit understanding of a portfolio’s  
purpose and objective and a clear definition of success 
in determining whether the portfolio fulfills that purpose 
and meets that objective.
2.	 Create a charter outlining the roles and responsi-
bilities of committee members, support staff, and—if 
­applicable—consultants and outsourced CIO.
3.	 Establish a clear investment strategy that includes a  
reasonable set of assumptions about a sponsoring organi-
zation’s risk tolerance and expected returns.
4.	 Establish a straightforward process for hiring managers 
to implement that investment strategy and for identifying 
the circumstances under which such relationships can be 
terminated.
5.	 Act with common sense and discipline.
As the world of finance continues its exponential path of increased complex-
ity, determining lines of authority, delegating roles and responsibilities, and 
implementing oversight policies are essential to success. This process and 
structure we will call governance. The actual definition of governance can be 
summed up as “the processes, structures and organizational traditions that 
determine how power is exercised, how stakeholders have their say, how 
decisions are taken and how decision-makers are held accountable.”

Outsourcing 
Investment 
Decision 
Making
As we have discussed, good governance exists when the board and investment 
committee are allowed to focus on issues that impact the long-term objec-
tives of the fund, rather than being responsible for investment decisions. Part 
of good governance is simply acknowledging the fact that managing investable 
assets is a full-time job, and not some collateral duty for the investment 
committee, the board, or the CFO.
While the investment committee or board focuses on strategy and the exter-
nal investment managers select securities and investments, there exists a 
need to connect (or link) the right investment managers and strategies to 
the big-picture items recommended by the board. Constructing a connection 
between the investment committee (or board) and the external investment 
managers is done through one of the governing models we discussed earlier 
(Traditional, Contracted, or Internal Model). Metaphorically speaking, this indi-
vidual (CIO) or group (investment office or consultant) can be thought of as 
the director between the script and the performer, or the conductor between 
the music and the musician.

Chapter 7 | Outsourcing Investment Decision Making

Throughout the course of this book, we have discussed several approaches to 
answering “how” a governing body might supply that middle connection, and we 
hope we made it clear that our bias is toward an internal investment office or 
contract office rather than a “do it yourself” or consultant solution. A recent phe-
nomenon that we have yet to discuss is a trend toward investment outsourcing.
Many smaller institutions discovered the Traditional Model (i.e., using a con-
sultant) was an effective method for improving their investment management 
program from the “do It Yourself” approach. However, as the institutions’ 
funds grew in size, most came to the realization that the traditional model 
and the consultant did not keep pace with their needs of good governance. 
In search of ways to address these needs, many institutions have looked for a 
different strategy, and outsourcing has been the fastest growing solution.
According to a Northern Trust survey, in 2012, 14% of institutions outsourced all 
of their investment management activities. In 2013, that number doubled to 29%. 
We believe this is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, with such strong 
growth in the space, many marketers have grabbed hold of the word “outsourc-
ing” and obfuscated its meaning to the point where it has left many institutional 
investors wondering what outsourcing models truly exist. To bring clarity to the 
issue we will discuss the three most common outsourcing solutions: (1) oCIO 
(also called discretionary consulting), (2) Pooled or commingled accounts, and 
(3) the contracted investment office. There will be some institutions that offer 
a variation of an outsourcing model, and others that call it something entirely 
different, but at its core these are the three main outsourcing solutions.
In a study entitled “The New Gatekeepers: Winning Business Models for 
Investments Outsourcing,” Casey Quirk defined outsourcing as an investor 
delegating “…some level of investment discretion to a third party for a portfolio-
based fee.” Casey Quirk and others note that the outsourcing assignment may 
be all or part of the institution’s assets, that discretion may be all-inclusive or 
partial, and that fees may be asset-based, fixed, or performance-based. So what 
does this mean for you? It means the outsourcing universe is enormous, and 
the number of varying arrangements is immense. It has also caused confusion 
among institutions looking at outsourcing options because they aren’t exactly 
sure at what options exist. Under this common definition, almost any relation-
ship can be called outsourcing (and is). However, as we mentioned, there are 
really only three basic outsourcing solutions.
The first of the solutions is the Outsourced CIO (oCIO) product, also known 
as discretionary consulting. This product was developed by investment 
consulting firms as a way to repackage their services into a higher mar-
gin business. The oCIO model is essentially a continuation of the traditional 
approach, the primary difference being that an oCIO, with full discretion, imple-
ments the manager recommendations and any asset allocation changes. This 
contrasts with the more traditional approach in which the consultant offers 
recommendations and the implementation is executed through the institution  

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
43
(the board, investment committee, or CFO). Outside of implementation, the 
only other difference is cost. The oCIO model has a much higher price tag 
than the traditional investment-consulting model; yet the advice (such as which 
managers to hire and fire or asset allocation policy) must, in fact, be the same. 
If the advice being offered differs between the firm’s investment consulting 
arm and the oCIO arm, one has to ask which entity gives the better advice. 
As fiduciaries, investment consultants have a duty to recommend the managers 
that they believe are best suited for the portfolio. Because the objectives of the 
portfolio haven’t changed, how can the recommendations of the firm’s oCIO 
arm be any different than those from their investment consultant arm?
You have to give consultants credit for figuring out a way to get institutions 
to pay more for the same product they have always delivered. By paying a 
higher fee, the oCIO division of the consulting firm will execute their own 
advice. An institution that elects to use an oCIO is paying for the execution 
of advice—the same advice offered by the consultant. Not much credit is due 
to the institution for paying the higher fees, as they could implement all of the 
consultant’s advice without the added cost. Prior to the oCIO outsourcing 
product, investment consultants were giving their clients the best and sound-
est advice to each client, or so they said (and one should believe.)
The second outsourcing solution is a pooled or commingled fund. These funds 
are sometimes referred to as “endowment style” funds. They can also be 
thought of as “give us your money and go to sleep, we’ll handle everything” 
funds. The best things they “handle” are fees—their own fees. If only the 
returns were as big as the fees. Institutions that use the DIY Model of gover-
nance and do not want to participate in the management of their funds often 
believe that the resumes of the people associated with the pool, and their 
touted “endowment style” fund, will be enough to properly fulfill their duties.
While the idea of a pooled, or commingled, endowment-style fund will reso-
nate with smaller institutional investors, the “everybody in the pool” approach 
doesn’t align well with many institutions’ investment objectives. For smaller 
institutions ($10 Million or less) worried predominately about diversification 
and access to investment managers, this solution may well be a viable option. 
Yet, these smaller institutions must weigh the tradeoff between customiza-
tion (or lack thereof) and diversification. Pooled and commingled funds 
are designed to be a “one-size fits all” product that can benefit from scale. 
These funds often times over-diversify across managers (some firms have over  
200 managers) and asset classes in order to accommodate that scale. The high 
degree of diversification and high fees often cause a diluted performance.
The last of the outsourcing CIO models is the shared or contracted office. This 
is the Peter Drucker outsourcing that many people think of when thinking of 
“outsourcing.” Clients (members) are limited, portfolios are customized, and 
discretion is determined entirely by the client. Essentially, the contracted invest-
ment office acts as an institution’s in-house investment office and operates in 

Chapter 7 | Outsourcing Investment Decision Making
44
a similar capacity. This includes assisting not only in meeting the return objec-
tives, but also developing funding requirements, addressing cash-flow needs 
and volatility concerns, providing support during audits, and aiding corporate 
finance decisions. Working with various levels of discretion, the contracted 
investment office is tasked with developing an investment policy statement, 
implementing the investment program, performing managerial due diligence, 
making asset allocation recommendations, establishing risk metrics, creating 
performance reports, conducting research on various asset classes, review-
ing all limited partnership agreements, advising on custodial and brokerage 
accounts, monitoring liquidity, and tilting the portfolio given various market 
conditions. One of the benefits of a contracted investment office is their lower 
cost. Institutions that can’t afford or choose not to afford an internal invest-
ment office are able to replicate an in-house office at a fraction of the cost.  
A contracted investment office also provides their clients with the responsibility, 
accountability, and an advocacy that is typically only found internally.
There are some approaches to outsourcing that are hybrids (really a variation 
across multiple solutions) who take fewer clients and have mostly separate 
accounts, but who also offer pooled funds—most often funds in the alternatives 
space. Some hybrids are actually close to the shared (or contract) office; they 
just offer a pooled product. Yet, these hybrids often times have more accounts, 
which reduces service levels, and are generally more focused on new business, 
which takes time away from management of the investment portfolio and due 
diligence. Nevertheless, these hybrids have a place for some institutions.
The many variations in these outsourcing models cause confusion among insti-
tutional investors, as it’s not only difficult to distinguish one outsourced pro-
vider from the other but, perhaps more importantly, which outsourcer actually 
has your institution’s best interest in mind. In our opinion, the best way to 
navigate this problem is to determine if the outsourcer is acting as a principal 
or as an agent. Much like the real estate and brokerage communities, an agent 
acts for the client’s interest while a principal acts for his own. The same con-
cept applies to outsourced CIO models; those acting for themselves first are 
principals and those acting in the client’s interest are agents. How to distinguish 
from one another is not as hard as one might think. Size is the first indicator. 
A large organization that operates with multiple layers of management must 
focus their efforts on the organization and not on your fund. The number of 
clients can also be an indicator. Although a firm with many clients might look 
attractive initially, with a little thought, one would quickly realize that larger 
firms require more time to be exerted on other funds, which limits the amount 
of attention paid to your fund. The existence of pools or a large sales force are 
other indicators that the firm is acting as a principal and not as an agent.
Which outsourcer you chose depends on your goals and your institution’s 
circumstances. There is no inherently right or wrong answer. Using an orga-
nization as a principal may make sense for your institution. It is, however, 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
45
important to recognize there are viable outsourcing alternatives. Outsourcing 
serves a purpose for many institutions that have needs to be met.
Outsourcing is a way for institutions to manage their investment risk and align 
the investment strategy with the institution’s financial goals. Institutions want 
to leverage the professional expertise of these service providers. It might 
be easy to stick with the status quo, but it’s imprudent not to explore your 
options.

We have talked about several different approaches to governance, and as you 
have seen, we favor some and dislike some. As part of all of the approaches to 
governance, we find a particular mindset creeping in, that of the Gatekeeper. 
This always includes (or at least so often that we think it’s always) the 
consultant, but can include the CFO or whoever is the responsible party at 
the fund. While it makes sense to have a filter that reduces the workload of 
the investment committee, a gatekeeper is someone who thinks it is their job 
to keep away all the investment managers and ideas from the investment com-
mittee rather than just filter out the truly unreasonable. They are a de facto  
“pre-decision” maker—one who the investment manager must convince,  
convert or compensate.

The consultants are easy to understand; they have an account and don’t want 
any foreign intrusion to their domain and control. After all, if they are not 
bringing stuff to throw on the wall, what value do they bring? As a group, 
investment consultants control and dictate much of what transpires within 
the space, because they have so much sway in terms of assets and clients. This 
often has the effect of influencing asset managers as they seek to grow their 
assets. In fact, asset managers often times must dedicate resources specifically 
toward developing and maintaining investment consultant relationships; 
otherwise, they will fail to raise their assets under management. In 2013, the 
consulting industry advised on some $13 trillion in tax-exempt U.S. institu-
tional assets, and over 70% of the large public pension plans in the United 
States used a consultant.1
Many asset managers have a separate consultant relationship staff. Investment 
consultants have the leverage to hold asset managers captive, paying-to-play 
before recommending these managers to the fund sponsors (consultant’s clients). 
They do this by offering services to asset managers (for a fee of course) where 
the investment consultant will “teach” the asset manager how to present and 
market their product to other investment consultants. Investment con-
sultants also host conferences, paid for entirely by the asset managers, that 
bring together sponsors (the consultant’s clients) and asset managers. Many, 
especially the investment banks, have a “platform” and charge managers to 
participate or take part of the manager’s fee.
What about the CFO, treasurer, board member, or other individual that is the 
first point of contact by the money managers or sellers of investments? They 
don’t have an economic reason to hold the gate, so why do they? Sometimes it 
is a power thing—they can, so they do. Most often, however, it is because they 
simply don’t know investments. They feel that by bringing up or permitting 
access, they are recommending the investment, which probably isn’t so. They 
may also feel that since the board isn’t clamoring for anything, isn’t unhappy 
and isn’t pushing for change, perhaps they shouldn’t rock the boat, and should 
hold what they have and wait. There is often an element of time; they simply 
don’t have any more time, what with the audit, budget, new construction, or 
whatever the event of the month is.
Whether it is a consultant barring the door for economic reasons, or someone 
else barring the door for other reasons, non-decision-makers are restricting 
the flow of ideas and options available to the decision-makers. The in-house or 
contract office doesn’t have that problem, since they are the decision-makers.

Having someone weed out the truly unusable in order to avoid wasting the 
board’s time is commendable. Having a gatekeeper keep out usable ideas is 
not. Periodic review of those that did not make it past the gatekeeper or adding a 
board member to the gatekeeping function are two ways to manage the issue, 
and managing this filtering is a must for the board.
The CFO of a large Houston energy company was attending the SRE 
Certification class with an industry speaker on the functioning of the security 
execution system: how it operated, who got paid what and how, and how to 
reduce the cost of executions. She commented to me that the speaker had 
called her 8–10 times in the past but she had been too busy and didn’t really 
know what he wanted. She said that not returning the call was a mistake, 
and could I introduce her to the speaker so she could make an appointment, 
because he could really help save some money.
Salesmen are like viruses; they spread things. In their case, it is information. 
Even in this information revolution and age of the internet, salesmen serve 
as a push for information that one may not know they need or could use. 
Speaking to them is important. Gatekeepers hold back that information.

Academia
In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. But in 
practice there is.
—Yogi Berra
We are all conditioned to appeal to the academic for understanding and guidance 
on most, if not all, complex ideas. In economics, Milton Freidman, F.A. Hayek, 
and John Maynard Keynes are names many turn to. For investments, Harry 
Markowitz, William Sharpe, and Burton Malkiel start the list.
The global institutional investment industry is based on the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model (CAPM), Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), and Modern 
Portfolio Theory (MPT). Developed or expanded by outstanding academics 
(Markowitz, Sharpe, Eugene Fama, and others), these theories and their expan-
sions are elegant easily learned, and provide a theoretical base from which 
to expand research (and more academics). They are, as is the case with most 
academic research, tied up in the averages, the use of large numbers, an expec-
tation that investors are part of some greater whole and that any set of actual 
experiences will mean revert to the averages of the universe. These theories 
provide a wonderful view from a window in the ivory tower at 80,000 feet 
and truly should be part of any academic curriculum, but they simply don’t 
work “down in the weeds” of the day-to-day practice of investment man-
agement. They are divorced from the reality of managing the portfolio of a 
foundation as a unique entity and not as just one random observation in a 
universe of foundations. Investors live in a world of small numbers, where they 
are the universe, not some random sample, and so there is no mean to revert 
to other than their own.

As investors, we don’t have the average of all investments to judge. We judge 
one investment at a time. It can’t revert to a mean of the many just its own 
mean. Correlation of one class to another is not relevant, although correlation 
of one of your fund’s investments to another one of your fund’s investments 
might be—that is, if it didn’t change every time you measured it. Standard devi-
ation of the class can’t be applied to our single investment, only the charac-
teristics of our single investment’s return distribution. Our fund’s investment 
manager is, or might be, too skewed or peaked, or the tails may be too fat, or 
the whole thing might be asymmetrical, to even have the standard deviation 
concept apply, and if it does, is it relevant, and is it really risk?
The world of MPT and CPM has been taken over by consultants and popular 
business writers and treated like some gospel or holy writ. It has become a 
religion, which makes me a heretic to say that it is only a basic generalized 
description of the investment world (perhaps a good academic one). But to 
use the theory, one must—must—make several assumptions:
The first and most important assumption is that all returns are normally dis-
tributed. This is much like saying in physics that there is no friction. You can 
certainly assume it, but can seldom find it. The reality is that all investment 
return distributions are not normal (symmetrical around the mean, with a 
co-incident mean and median, and not peaked or flat). Actual investments and 
investment managers’ return distributions are seldom symmetrical, often have 
different means and medians and are often more peaked or have fat tails.
The second assumption is that we are dealing with large numbers, such that 
the portfolio is just a random sample that might approximate the universe. In 
fact, we deal with small numbers and our fund is the universe (which changes). 
There is no reversion to the mean because there is no mean of a universe 
larger than our sample to revert to. Does anyone think that a particular 7-foot 
center playing for the Denver Nuggets will somehow revert to the 5-foot-8 
average of all men? Or that Yo-Yo Ma will somehow regress to the mean of 
all high school cellists? These are terrible circumstances for a theorist, but 
wonderful ones for an investor.
The third assumption is that risk is equal to standard deviation. To make that 
assumption, one must believe that risk is the inability to predict the next 
period’s return, and missing it by 5% over is the same as missing by 5% under. 
True, if you are a weather forecaster or a marksman, but this is the silliest of 
all the assumptions for a CIO or an investment committee. Risk, for a real 
investor (and not a theorist), is not achieving a particular goal; in other words, 
not winning, but losing. Crossing the street? Risk is getting hit —losing. Flying? 
Crashing is a big loss. We ask ourselves “What are the chances of…” not 
“What is the standard deviation of…?”
The last of the major assumptions is that everyone is equally above average 
(maybe in Lake Wobegon) and that they all make perfect decisions all of the 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
55
time. Far from it; some people are better at investing than others. We want 
those people. It is simply not true that no one can beat the averages. That lie 
is pedaled by people selling index funds to individuals who simply want to 
put their heads in the sand and not have to think. It is beyond any reasoned 
belief that there are stars and virtuosos in every profession except among 
professional investors. All of the hype and press surrounding Warren Buffet 
and the acclaim of past stars like Peter Lynch and Sir John Tempelton give the 
lie to that theory. Averages, by definition, mean some are better and some are 
worse. Finding the better ones may be work, but to borrow from the Marines: 
No one called investing a rose garden.
Also implicit in the CAPM theory is a serious and distracting element: that 
every investor needs to earn the highest absolute return per unit of volatility. 
This assumes portfolios need to be efficient relative to volatility, as if some-
how volatility matters. What about efficient relative to compound return, or 
to cash flow, or to risk of loss?
These assumptions are required for the theory when applied on a macro 
scale, and may make sense looking out from that 80,000 foot ivory tower. But 
to manage real assets we must move beyond these theories to face the facts: 
(1) distributions of returns by real managers are often skewed or peaked, (2) 
we see only a small group of returns, but all of the returns of the manager or 
investment, (3) real risk is the chance that we lose money or under-perform 
our goal, and (4) some people really do perform better than others.
Theory is great from the ivory tower, a grand unification. But we are not flying 
so high, that everything looks smooth. We as investors are dodging the rocks 
and shoals of daily investing: recession, recovery, inflation, war, new discovery 
of oil, regulatory changes, fear, greed, irrational investor behavior, fads, inno-
vation, creative destruction, destructive accounting rules, and the list goes 
on. Change is the only constant. We make good choices and bad choices. 
People are not perfect. There is random chance and fraud. Day-to-day investing  
for institutions is not some neat equation on autopilot, but a rather a real  
job of blending the theories with experience and risk-taking in order to 
produce results.
In the real world, investments drive performance. Diversification controls risk.

Basics
Hell, there are no rules here—we’re trying to accomplish something.
—Thomas Edison
Â = a + b + e
Return = Alpha + Beta + Randomness
Overriding much of today’s discussion of investment strategy is an implicit, 
and often explicit, belief in the existence of both Alpha and Beta, Alpha being 
the return skill adds over the strategy style or the market segment’s return 
(Beta). Alpha and its importance (and identification) are being discovered, or 
rather rediscovered, after a long period of index focus. The tone over the last 
few years has been “Alpha is King.” Before that, it was the index mantra of 
“Buy Beta, there is no Alpha.” But are either correct?
As we see from the simple formula Return = Alpha plus Beta plus a ran-
dom error, Alpha is only a part of the function; Beta also has an equal role, 
as does the random variable. A fund can manage the Alpha part only through 
the selection of managers, and manage the Beta part (if at all) with the timing 
of change in allocations (not the allocation itself). Most difficult is the random 
error term, which can be partly managed through diligence of the managers 
and the economy, partly through diversification and size control of assets, 
partly through investment policy and a loss buffer, and then, of course, there

is always prayer. The task of managing return is not as simple as doing each of 
the three parts of the equation in sequence. This is a problem of simultaneous 
equations, where one equation depends on another equation.
If not the originator of the idea, certainly one of the most diligent and well-
known of the promoters of index funds has been Burton Malkiel, author of 
Random Walk Down Wall Street. I spoke with him a few years back and what 
he said was quite revealing. He was then still a proponent of index, and by that 
he did not mean the S&P 500 (which he called a “managed fund”), but “the 
total market” (5,000 or more names). He said that in areas where Alpha is 
present he would “rather have a manager that can add that value.” Absolute 
heresy from the high priest of indexing, but he was talking about hedge funds, 
and said that he thought that in the alternative investment world “things were 
different.” They simply are not; Alpha or returns above the average exist 
everywhere by definition. Malkiel also said that “surviving mutual funds do 2% 
better than all mutual funds,” “hedge fund survivors do 1,000% better than all 
hedge funds,” and implied that we should buy a bit of all hedge funds. Why 
hedge funds? “Because they have Alpha,” he said. (I’m not sure he makes a dis-
tinction between hedge funds and separate account managers.) We need not 
constrain ourselves to just hedge funds for Alpha; many other managers have 
it as well. There is nothing magic about paying 2&20 that generates Alpha.
a
What is important to institutions is that Alpha exists through the employment 
of intellectual capital, and that it adds value. It is this Alpha— value added—
intellectual capital that we as investors should be finding and using. A large and 
well-known university has identified that more than half of their performance 
is due to the identification of superior managers. Finding superior managers 
is much more than looking at their track record for the last five years. If only 
it were that simple; we could find the best track record, jump into the family 
time machine, and—bam!—do over those same five years. Since Apple has 
not come out with that app yet, we can only use a manager’s track record 
to screen for managers that have some ability to do better, to add Alpha and 
hopefully continue to do so. It is the diligence and evaluation that will help us 
forecast and answer the question: can they perform in the future.
There are several ways of getting to that forecast, but the one that works best 
is to build a distribution of the investment’s or the manager’s returns and to 
see what is most common. If we can find a peaked (lots of the same thing), 
skewed (more good things than bad) and mean-shifted (high expected or aver-
age returns), we have a manager that we can feel somewhat confident about. 
While it is likely that this manager has a “something,” some sort of asset (we 
call it intellectual capital) that will continue to provide that Alpha, there is 
also a chance that what we have seen is just that—chance. After all, someone 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
59
always wins the lottery. This is where diligence by experienced investment 
officers comes into play. This part of due diligence is beyond the simple clip-
board checks of the consultants and investment banks; it’s an examination of 
why the Alpha occurred. It is the search for and hopeful discovery of, under-
standing and getting one’s hands around the intellectual capital. Who has it? 
One person, or more? Can it be transferred? Is it fragile? What risks might 
impact it negatively? And most importantly, how can it help our portfolio?
This piece of the management of a fund is important because you want evi-
dence that a manager will continue to perform going forward. Once a manager 
has been hired, you are monitoring that “intellectual capital” to find changes 
(negative or positive). This part of the task is much like managing a ball team 
and trying to keep top players. What you want are investments or managers 
that fit into your particular system, your portfolio, to support return without 
adding risk. The unfortunate part is that many good managers or investments 
will not fit the plan because you are not only optimizing across return, but risk 
as well. This approach leaves out some otherwise good managers or invest-
ments because they don’t add value (better returns or lower risk) to the 
whole portfolio. That is OK.
b
Strategies that try to produce only Alpha have been a problem for me, much 
like index investing. Why one would want to take a major part of the equation 
and set it to zero is beyond me. Just Alpha (market neutral hedge funds) is as 
bad as just Beta (index funds). Markets are a primary generator for returns 
and cannot be ignored. You should use them and be agnostic as to whether 
this month’s return was from Beta or Alpha. A manager who rides only Beta 
in up markets, but then rides Alpha up while in a down market may very well 
be an outstanding option for you. Every manager rides Beta sometimes, but 
only a few can produce significant Alpha in addition over time. The key here 
is over time; not necessarily every day, week, month, or even year. Finding these 
managers is the investor’s task.
We all should also be aware that not everything works all the time. Even 
though, over the long run, markets go up most of the time, they go down as 
well. You also know that not all markets or all parts of one market react in 
concert, so you should “adapt” or “tilt” or “invest strategically” during the 
midrange times (one, three, or five years). Timing here is not an all-in or all-
out strategy, and by timing we mean that you must consider the economy as 
well as any other areas that might impact the markets, and take those issues 
into consideration. For example, today, if you expect interest rates to go up, 
it would probably be a bad time to buy long dated zero coupon bonds, but in 
the 1980’s, when long dated zero coupon treasuries were in the high teens, it 
was a good time to buy. We definitely do not mean “timing” in the mutual fund 

Chapter 10 | Investment Basics
60
flavor-of-the-month sense of timing, or in the momentum day trading investing 
sense, but rather in the sense of situational awareness, and only as a means for 
adapting to change.
As a baseline, institutional investors diversify by looking for investments that 
have different information sources, return sources, and a different set of 
risks; in other words, investments that are clearly differentiated from others. 
(Notice we did not include “name” of “asset class”). By spreading out the 
sources of returns and risk you are dealing with the question, “What do you 
do when you don’t know what to do?” When you don’t know what to do, you 
should do a little of many things, which is playing the middle of the road and 
not making a bet on any one sector or market. This means that you lean on 
the managers of the investments to know more and to make decisions within 
their area of expertise.
But what about when you do know (or think you know)? All in? No, this 
baseline is a baseline for a reason. It is a touchstone, a center point, so that 
you always know where you are or should be. If you know or think you know 
a certain thing, you can tilt or overlay the portfolio, but not necessarily make 
major shifts. While you think you might really know, you can be, and often 
are, wrong. We all are. This center point can be moved. It need not be fixed 
forever, but it does provide a “safe” haven.
We are not talking about asset allocation here, although that is part of dealing 
with Beta. We are talking about an interaction between our goals, policies, and 
managers, and the risks we are willing to take. Relying on Beta for some of our 
return will mean some volatility in the portfolio. How much one is willing to 
have is a question of policy. How much the fund is willing to tilt and what con-
stitutes a major shift are also policy issues. Simple volatility is not a bad thing.

The random error term is really the sum of three error terms, and represents 
the tail risk in each of the return function’s other terms (one for Alpha, one 
for Beta and one truly random one). In addition, each of those terms is split 
into two parts: the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns. These are 
events that you can describe but not know when, or even if, they will occur, 
and events that you don’t know in order to forecast but can expect some 
event to surprise. In the tails of each manager’s distribution or in the tails 
of each factor’s distribution you can find events that will cause or may cause 
some impact to the portfolio, and for that event you can find an investment 
to either take advantage of the event or reduce the impact of the event. 
Obviously this is easier to do with those events we can identify as “might-
happen” and much harder with events you can’t predict or, if you can predict,

don’t recognize as important events. In both cases, even when these events 
are identified, it may not be possible to fully implement a solution, leaving you 
with increased risk.
Even though it is difficult, investors should, and do, try to reduce these risks or 
take advantage of the opportunities available. This effort adds value in times 
of great volatility and dislocation. The solution may be complex, or it may be 
as simple as increased cash. Looking forward and managing these issues high-
lights the skill of the investment officer.
Getting Started
To start, we need a plan, a document that represents the governance inputs 
of the investment committee. In the past, this was most often a set of rules 
called the investment policy, but more recently has been called by some the 
“risk budget” to more neatly fit the concept of budgeting risk as part of the 
portfolio management process. We think of it as a governance document that 
incorporates all three.
Whichever term, this planning document provides the basis—the beginning 
governance—for managing the portfolio. The document works best when 
used by the committee as its tool for governing (not day-to-day or month-to-
month managing) and monitoring the portfolio.
The plan must start with a well-chosen objective and time horizon added to 
a value and definition for risk. This gives you a place to start and to evaluate 
everything that follows. In my opinion, little that does not relate to gover-
nance, return or risk should be in there. A key issue to start with is: How do 
we define risk, and how do we measure it?

The Role of Risk
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and 
looks like work.
—Thomas Edison
From the academic view of the markets, return gets paired with either Beta 
or standard deviation (volatility) as a measure of risk. But when using volatil-
ity as a definition of risk, one must believe that risk is the difference amongst 
returns or, more precisely, the average of these differences each period from 
the average expected return. But is it? Expected return is the mean of the 
distribution; it is the one guess that has the least average error. To an engineer 
manufacturing parts, being too big or too small is truly an error and unaccept-
able; to a meteorologist, being a few degrees above or below the forecast tem-
perature is an error and unacceptable. To a Naval Aviator, coming across the 
back end of a carrier a foot higher or lower is an error and really unacceptable. 
But what about to an investment portfolio? Are you forecasting a return such 
that exceeding that return is an error and unacceptable? Thankfully no, or 
many of us would be out of a job. What if you have an expected or average 
return of 15% and got 13%—is that risk?
Some take the higher return idea to point out that only half the standard 
deviation is risk—the part below the mean. Still, is 13% risky compared to 
an expectation of 15%? What about when our requirement is 8%, is 13% still 
risky? Not in my portfolio. If the requirement is 7.5% (frequently used by pub-
lic pensions), is a US Treasury Bond at 6% risky? Of course! That’s like playing 
Russian roulette with six live cartridges—you always lose.
Risk to an investment portfolio is that which is an error, a failure, and is 
unacceptable—generally a return below some actual number. It might be zero, 
which would mean any loss is unacceptable but any gain is acceptable, or it 
might be a number that is required to support a budget or to accomplish 
11

Chapter 11 | The Role of Risk

something else. Frequently, foundations take the payout required (5%, per-
haps), add inflation, and get a number, say for example, 8%. This would then 
mean anything less than the 8% makes for an unhappy organization and any-
thing over 8% a happy one (and 13% even happier). Risk in every other arena 
is the chance of a bad outcome or failure, so the chance or probability of 
returning less than 8% in this portfolio would be the risk. The probability of 
not paying retirement benefits, the chance of a Madoff-like investment result, 
the chance that [whatever], all can be and are risks, and are measured by prob-
ability not deviations, standard or otherwise.
Risk has a few more elements to it. Not only is it the chance that there is a 
failure—the size of that failure counts, too. Can it be that walking down the 
sidewalk is risky? Probably not. What are the chances of falling off a five-
foot-wide strip of concrete (sober, that is)? Pretty low. What are the conse-
quences? Also pretty low. But, raise that five-foot plank 100 stories into the 
air and risk rises as well because of the consequences. More specifically, for 
investments, a 1% position that has a high chance of going away is far less risky 
(to the portfolio) than another investment that is 30% of the portfolio with 
half the probability of failure as the first. The first investment, by itself, is risky, 
but when included as part of the portfolio, the portfolio’s risk may be little 
affected or even reduced.
Standard Deviation
Standard Deviation is the traditional meme of the consulting industry and the 
academic. It is a measure of volatility, as if the simple movement of each month 
or quarter’s return is somehow risk. Using standard deviation as a measure of 
risk would mean that risk is missing the mean of the return distribution by plus 
or minus some value. Some just use the downside deviation (Sortino ratio), 
again believing that a return of 12% when the mean is 15% is somehow risk.
In order to actually use standard deviation as risk, there are several assump-
tions that need to be made. First is that all returns are normally distributed 
(symmetrical around the mean, with a co–incident mean and median, and not 
peaked or flat), but in reality they seldom are. Financial data and especially time 
series data are seldom normally distributed, so this first assumption is a big 
one. Missing an expected value is risk for financial theorists, or the operational 
research guys, or medical researchers, or theoretical physicists, and even naval 
aviators, but not for investors. Risk, for a real investor (and not a theorist), is 
not achieving a particular goal; in other words, losing (not wining).
Built into this use of standard deviation is an insidious little quirk used by 
managers, consultants and investment officers that has crept into the popular 
culture. It is the phrase “risk adjusted return”. What is that? Often we hear, 
“Our risk adjusted return last [period of time] was X%.” Our next question is 
always “What was the actual un-adjusted return?” You know a strange thing? 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
65
It is always the same as the unadjusted return. Evidently, adjusting doesn’t 
change the return at all. Try this for fun: Next time you hear those words, ask 
what the raw unadjusted return was, or better yet, how they adjusted the raw 
return, and watch them squirm. If you adjust something, you make it larger or 
smaller—it can’t always stay the same. There is risk and there is return. This 
idea that one must take more risk to get more return is a myth discussed 
more in Chapter 20.
Stochastic Dominance
Another tool the industry used to use more often, stochastic dominance, has 
the right idea but can only be used pair-wise. We cannot use it to evaluate 
more than two distributions at a time. Even when you compare managers 
using a winner-takes-on-the-next-manager strategy to help narrow the field, 
stochastic dominance only sometimes works, and then only in special cases. It 
cannot be used in every case to evaluate risk.
What this approach does is compare one cumulative probability function to 
another in order to determine by how much one dominates (or exceeds) the 
other relative to the first, second and third moments of the utility curve. In 
English: at various returns, one or the other has more probability and there-
fore is a better selection, so by adding up all of these differences we can see 
which has the “best” net overall score, or “dominates.”
Example:
One investment might have a 3% chance of losing 10%, and a different investment 
an 8% chance of losing 10%. Sounds like investment A is our winner. But then we see 
that the first option also has a 20% chance of losing money (a return of less than 
zero) and the second option a 15% chance of losing money. Maybe now we should 
change our minds. But then again, the first has a 10% chance of a return of more 
than 13% and the second only a 4% chance of exceeding 13%. Do we change our 
minds again?
The stochastic dominance method has always been seductive, but is so  
limited by the pair-wise restriction that its use is limited. It does, however, have 
a variation that leads to other risk review techniques—for example, if we only 
look at the dominance at a certain point and not the whole distribution. If 
one were to pick a number that represented the minimum required return—
say, 8%—we could determine which manager or investment dominates at 
that required return, and therefore which provides the least risk of failure. 
There are some issues that crop up in allocation using this technique only, like  
the 8% bond, which would dominate anything else at that one level but fail 
everywhere else.

Chapter 11 | The Role of Risk
66
Omega (Gamma)
There is a variation on stochastic dominance that tries to get around the 
pair-wise limitation. For this approach, you take the probabilities of doing less 
than a particular return and divide it into the probabilities of doing more. That 
gives you the omega ratio at that return number. If you do it for every return 
possible you get an omega function, a line or curve that can be compared to 
other lines/curves. It works, but is math-intensive and adds nothing over what 
a simple comparison of the actual distribution would show, and those distribu-
tions are more intuitive to read and understand.
Simulation
This approach uses the various managers and investments, calculates a distri-
bution of all of each manager’s returns, then using simulation (Monte Carlo 
sampling is most common) conducts thousands of random possibilities to find 
a resultant distribution of returns from which various probabilities can be 
determined. Selecting a single target (or several), we can then find the cumula-
tive probability of doing better or of doing worse. Multiplying that probabil-
ity by the assets gives us a consequence or “value at risk,” bringing into the 
examination both the probability of loss and its weighted size.
Risk and its consequence seems the best place to start our investment pro-
cess, and to do that we start with risk and its control. Risk is the probability 
of losing, so we start with a description of just what losing is. Is it actual loss 
of cash? Or is it a return below a certain level?
For most foundations and endowments, risk is, or should be, a return less 
than what they need to spend, plus inflation, plus something extra to grow 
the fund. Our assumption here is that they do not want to reduce principal, 
so they need a return that is at least as much as their payout. Then, since they 
often would like the money they spend to have as much effect tomorrow as 
it does today, they will need to add inflation. Then they may decide that all of 
that is good, but they also want to do more tomorrow than today, which will 
require another added bit. For example, if we need to spend 4.5% of the fund 
and inflation is running 2.5%, and we add another 1% (just because), we find 
that a “win” would be any return above 8%.
Using the simulation approach, we can value other risks to the portfolio 
besides the market-or investment-related risks. We can value business risk 
of the manager failing as a going concern, key man risk, event risk, or headline 
risk, or whatever else there might be.

The Role 
of Money 
Managers
Only the mediocre are always at their best.
—Jean Giradoux
Contrary to reports from all the index fund sellers, it is possible to beat the 
averages, and possible to find managers who can do so consistently. If you do 
even the slightest thinking on the subject, it becomes obvious. We learned in 
grade school that the “average” was the middle, so by definition some must 
be above (and of course some below). An index is supposed to be at or near 
the average, so some will (must) do better. While it is certainly possible to find 
the “better,” it is not always easy. Instead of thinking like Buzz Lightyear and 
looking for a manager who will last “to infinity and beyond,” it is best to think 
more like a coach of a ball team and find a set of star players for now, while 
continuing to look for upgrades. Sooner or later that star player will retire or 
miss a step.
This is one area that actually makes me mad. If you really believe that everyone 
is the same and no one can out-perform for more than just an instant, then 
why go to all this trouble? Simply buy that index and forget it until it’s time to 
draw the funds. No need for a consultant, no need for an investment commit-
tee, no need to think. But it is strange, isn’t it, that in every endeavor there are 
better and worse, good and bad, top and bottom, winners and losers, except

in the case of investments? If an economics professor can be better and be 
awarded recognition in the form of a Nobel prize, can’t a money manager be 
better too?
Warren Buffett did not beat the indexes every day, every week, every month 
or even every year. So what? Money invested with him would shame all other 
foundations. A $10,000 investment in Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1965 
would have grown to be worth nearly $30 million 40 years later. That's long-
term investing, and about 60 times as much as you would have made if you'd 
invested $10,000 in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and held it for those 
same 40 years.
Even over shorter periods, Buffett’s track record is clearly outstanding.  
A $10,000 investment in Berkshire Hathaway in November 1976 would have 
been worth more than $15,000,000 at the end of 2011. Over this time period, 
Berkshire realized an average annual return of 19% in excess of the T-Bill rate, 
significantly outperforming the general stock market’s average excess return 
of 6.1%. Yes, the volatility was high; Buffett had a volatility of 25%, which was 
markedly higher than the market’s volatility of 16%, but you would have been 
well compensated, even overcompensated, for that volatility.
Knowing this record, would you have hired him as a manager? Did you know 
that from July 1998 through February 2000, Berkshire lost 44% of its market 
value while the overall stock market gained 32%? No internet bubble for him. 
Would you have kept him?
What is disconcerting is that the academics and index fund sellers all make the 
assumption that there is no change in managers over time, no new ones com-
ing in or old ones going out, and that all of those above and below the average 
will become the average over time. There is change; the managers change and 
your portfolio will change. The facts are that some are better than others in 
every endeavor, including investments, and it is those top money managers 
that we want on our team.
The key to success in any group or team is getting the best players possible. 
In every walk of life, understanding of this basic fact, and a realization that 
some are better than others, is part of the fabric of our nature. No one 
expects everyone to be equally good at sports, music, art, math, or anything 
else, except in the literature surrounding investments. There, we are told, all 
managers are equal and we all should aspire to be as close as possible to aver-
age (the index or benchmark). In fact, many managers are well above average 
over long periods of time, and some are far above average.
When an investment committee looks for an investment manager, just what 
is it that they want? What are they really looking for? For that ball player, it is 
physical prowess and skill; for a musician, talent; for a mathematician, intelli-
gence and insight; and for a money manager, “intellectual capital.” (Think entre-
preneurial capital, financial capital or labor capital.) This is not ­necessarily an 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
69
IQ of 180 or an MBA from Harvard. This intellectual capital is just a name 
we give to the combination of (1) the philosophy, process, or approach to 
investing—the manager’s “trick,” if you will—and (2) the manager’s skill at 
executing that process. This combination is the capital that you're buying and 
importantly want in your manager.
The focus must be on the individual providing that intellectual capital (actually 
making the decisions) far more than the organization he or she belongs to. As 
with anything that requires the skill of a person, the quality of this intellectual 
capital ramps up, plateaus and falls off over time. One can think of many once-
great ball players with physical capital that, after an event (injury or age), just 
are not up to the task as well as a new player might be. Quality counts even 
if we can have it with a certain manager only a short time—at least for that 
time we have the best. Turnover in managers, like stocks in a portfolio or ball 
players on a team, is to be expected.
Often people use the brand name of an organization to make their decisions. 
(The old “you can’t be faulted if you buy IBM.”) They are lost souls. This is 
not picking cars or clothes; designer names or great corporate names are no 
guarantee of success, and often a bar to it. It is the individual(s) that make the 
decisions who are important, not the brand or logo on their business card. 
“Once upon a time” does not help either. The organization that once upon 
a time had a stellar reputation may no longer employ those individuals who 
created such standing. This perceived quality may no longer exist if the people 
that created it were not able to transfer the intellectual capital in its entirety 
to their successors. You may be dealing with the next generation, who may 
not be as good as the first.
This means that, much of the time, these outstanding managers are with 
smaller firms run by one or two outstanding people. This is not always the 
case, and should not diminish the value of large firms, but it does tend to be 
true. Dependence on small firms or one or two people within a large firm is 
not easy, nor is it well-received on the cocktail circuit. It’s much easier to tell 
that fellow at the club a manager’s name he has heard before than to explain 
why you are using a smaller firm or one unknown to him. It’s also harder to 
monitor the small firm since the board or staff must always be on the lookout 
for any changes at the management firm, and can’t always rely on the trade 
press (and even they get it wrong, mostly).
This evolution and change is just one of the risks in dealing with strong intel-
lectual capital. Whether the change is rapid (hit by the proverbial bus), surpris-
ing (sale of the firm or retirement), or slow (transition to the next generation), 
the fund can expect to be finding a replacement sooner or later. Diligence is 
not something that one does only at the beginning; rather, it is regular and 
continuous.

Chapter 12 | The Role of Money Managers
70
Monitoring change is the heart and soul of diligence, both before, but most 
importantly after, you have hired a manager. Change is an unquantifiable risk 
element, a random element that experienced investment officers should be 
able to find. Diligence is the regular review of the manager with a mind to 
find anything that might impinge on the intellectual capital: that thing you are 
buying. It is the noticing of flags and hints, the turning over of rocks and the 
understanding of what is or might be happening that makes diligence difficult 
enough that real experience is required to execute it. It is not the filling out of 
a questionnaire on a clipboard of checklists.
For example: One manager with three principals had good performance and a 
great story, but digging deep on each name in the portfolio it became apparent 
that the analyst sitting in a cubicle was the one with all the answers. Soon it 
was obvious that the intellectual capital was actually held by this woman. So 
diligence became not talking to the principals, but to her as well. When she 
became pregnant—a flag—would she return? When asked—yes, she would—
but then her husband took a job in Memphis (an even bigger flag). It was time 
to find a new manager well before she actually left. Other flags? Buying an air-
plane before learning to fly. One manager had a habit of keeping every issue of 
the WSJ in stacks on the floor, but spending time in the office one could notice 
that the newest was several weeks old; obviously he had not been in his office 
for an extended period of time. Each of these three managers has one thing 
in common—they are now out of business. None of these flags is on some 
Procrustean checklist, but each heralds a change in the manager and a risk to 
the intellectual capital that you are buying. Finding that change and mitigating 
risk is what diligence and managing a portfolio is all about.
Sure, getting the best managers or investments is partly getting 25% returns 
when everyone else is getting 15%, but it is much more. How can you actually 
find these managers? Can you truly bag one, or is this a snipe hunt? You need 
to find managers not with low tracking error but with high tracking error. 
You want managers with biased (skewed) and concentrated distributions of 
returns. In these distributions, mean-variance tools like standard deviation 
simply do not work, and so we rely on several other tools to find these 
managers.

Manager Search
Most stockbrokers and investment consultants have a platform of managers  
that they tout. Generally, and unfortunately, those platforms are small and 
relatively unchanging. Why such a small number of managers fit such a 
large number of clients is one of the industry’s mysteries. What is not 
a mystery is the financial relationship between them. Fortunately, today 
there are several commercial databases that collect money managers in 
varying styles or classes, which are used by investment officers and some 
better consultants. The databases make a convenient place to start since 
most managers list their performance with one or more of them.
The SEC requires every manager publishing his performance to make the 
statement “past performance does not guarantee future results,” as though 
this somehow escapes your attention and this simple statement will protect 
the unwise or unwary from unscrupulous actors such as Madoff. I guess it 
takes a bureaucrat to think we all believe in time machines to redo past per-
formance, or that anyone actually heeds those warnings. The reality is that 
past performance in every skill hints at a person’s potential to perform in the 
future, even if it does not guarantee it. It is the person’s skill we are looking 
for, and will ultimately buy, regardless of the provenance of their company’s 
name. So, like everyone else, ignore the statement and initially screen for top 
past performers. Why anyone would hire someone with a proven inability to 
deliver is beyond me, well except for those that want only a marquee name to 
hide behind. But then their concern is for themselves, not their institution.
Once the huge list of names is pared down to a more manageable group of top 
performers, it becomes time to ignore the absolute return number and start a 
deeper dive into each manager. At this point, we should all be looking for the 
lottery winners who simply rose to the top by chance. Not an easy task, or 
one that can be done with a checklist. Perhaps you can find a manager who 
never hit the top of the lists except for a one-time shot in the 2008 financial 
crash, or had only one investment that was exceptional for one month or year.

Chapter 13 | Manager Search

These managers get eliminated, followed by any fund reporting performance 
generated by individuals who are no longer there. This is especially common 
with mutual funds and large organizations, and is where “past performance 
does not guarantee future results” is truly the case. The key thing to remem-
ber is you are trying to identify top and consistent individuals.
With the now even smaller list you can build a histogram of each manager’s 
monthly returns. From the histogram you can see how the manager got to his 
performance. Was it tightly grouped? Were there a few bad returns, or just 
one? When did they occur? We are looking for managers that have high mean 
and median returns, but are also skewed (more good periods than bad) and 
peaked (grouped around a certain return number). If one or more does not 
meet the requirements, they can be eliminated, reducing the list even more. 
Now starts the really tough part—the onsite visits. You need to find the intel-
lectual capital.
Before we discuss the onsite visit, let’s talk about the “beauty pageant”: That 
wonderful day when the consultant lines up three or (if he is especially sadis-
tic) more managers to present, often in conjunction with that other approach 
to finding a marquee name and avoiding accountability— the RFP. On that sad 
day, after a coffee and sweet treat, the conga line of salesmen reading from 
their pitch books begins (they must believe the committee didn’t or couldn’t 
read them before and, unfortunately, they would be right), followed perhaps 
by a few questions from the committee and then a decision based on who 
gave the best presentation., This is an outstanding approach to selecting a 
good salesman, but to find outstanding intellectual capital, it never works. But, 
then again, it does feel good to say the committee spent all those hours doing 
diligence.
Real diligence is done in the manager’s office, onsite, talking to the decision-
makers and not salesmen. It includes a discussion with the research and trad-
ing staff and an evaluation of the firm. The purpose is to evaluate the story 
the manager tells. Is it really true that a committee of equals decides on a 
particular portfolio name, or is that just eyewash for the more equal of pigs 
who really makes the decisions? Do they really evaluate a stock name by the 
numbers, or is that just backfill, and what they really are buying is a story? 
They say they buy growth, but in practice they buy a theme. Is their value story 
really a growth-at-a-price story? The list is far too long for a questionnaire, 
and none of these are deal killers. The purpose is to understand and know 
what they really do so you can form an opinion on the questions “Can they 
really continue with this high performance?” and “How, or even can, they fit 
into your portfolio?” You also want to know if this intellectual capital can be 
tracked once they are hired (if they are hired).

Winning the Institutional Investing Race

Beyond that, what about the firm? It used to be called “management by walk-
ing around,” and it is a good way to get a feel for the firm and how it works 
for the employees. Some real examples: one firm, supposedly in business for 
years, had only one office, with personal stuff while the other five looked like 
they had been empty until about ten minutes ago. Were these guys for real? 
This was a red flag that marked a stone to look under; as it turned out, the 
firm was only a month old and had only one employee. The rest were friends 
for the day who wanted to work there. Other flags are the Dilbert cartoons 
the cube-dwellers put up often. They speak to management problems that 
may or may not affect performance. In another case, by talking to the man-
agement and staff of one firm you could have found they were focused on 
earnings for their families exclusively (even to the point of having the entire 
firm put up a wall of family photos), but not in providing for clients. “Good or 
bad” is your decision. Only a visit to the manager’s office and not a sales pre-
sentation, would have found relevant issues allowing you to make a prudent 
and informed decision. Diligence is finding intellectual capital and discovering 
what may affect it. Deciding whether those issues affecting the intellectual 
capital matter or whether to use the manager is implementation of manage-
ment of the portfolio. While these examples stand out, not all are so obvious. 
Sometimes it is only a feeling of unease, which must be further explored. 
Talking to their competition sometimes finds issues the manager would like 
to bury. None of this is on Procrustes’ iron bed of a checklist.
Each manager is different and each firm runs differently. Spending time on site 
lets you in on much more than just the sales presentation, but the decision is 
yours. Nothing is right or wrong, but the knowing is essential. One may want 
a manager with no outside life except managing assets, while another may like 
the fact that the manager spends a great deal of time in social and political 
circles. One institution used to insist that its managers have a high golf handi-
cap, thinking that a low handicap meant too much time on the golf course and 
not enough studying stocks.
After hiring, the diligence does not stop, because the manager must be visited 
regularly by your investment officer in order to gauge any change and to bet-
ter understand the process the manager uses. This permits the committee 
to understand what is happening in various situations and why. Is the current 
under-performance a slump, or is it indicative of a negative change? Time with 
the manager also permits the committee to see these changes and take the 
necessary actions.
This ongoing diligence is as important if not more so than the initial diligence 
and must be maintained if the fund is to be successful.

The Right Way 
to View Asset 
Allocation
One myth that came about in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s is that asset alloca-
tion is responsible for 90% of your return. The study used to “prove” this 
did not say so nor did its authors. This was a misunderstanding of the work 
and was pushed by index fund sellers and asset allocation study providers. 
Among the flaws of the study: many of the universities in the study used the 
same managers, and when the managers in an asset class were of different 
names their correlation and R2 were close. Asset classes were similar. About 
the only axis on which there could be difference was asset allocation, and it 
wasn’t much.
What the study actually said was only that the difference between any two 
portfolios was caused by allocation. So if one portfolio had a return of 10% 
and the other 10.1%, it was that tenth that was 90% caused by allocation, not 
the ten, according to this study. So, with so little difference between managers 
and only one real axis open to change, the real news was not that there was 
so much correlation to asset allocation, but so little.
This study kicked off an era of emphasis on the proper allocation and the 
importance of allocation of asset classes to the portfolio. Board members so 
wanted to make sure they got the allocation percentages right and that they 
had control of the portfolio through this allocation process that they all but 
forgot about the managers or investments themselves. Much time and energy

was spent on the allocation number and the range around that number, but 
where did these numbers and ranges come from? Were they correct? What 
did they do to the portfolio?
You, as board members, are told that one must optimize to the “efficient fron-
tier,” but when your consultant begins that task he finds quickly that he gets 
strange results (52% in frontier markets, distressed debt or some such) and 
that he then needs to add constraints. But where do these constraints come 
from? Evidently, my copy of Bill Sharpe’s work is missing a few pages, because 
it says nothing about how to construct constraints or even target allocation 
levels. Most board members don’t ask questions like, Why that target? Or, 
Why that asset class? Or, Why that range? Or, Why, if the theory works, even 
have constraints? If they do ask, they are not well answered. How do the con-
sultants really get targets, ranges and constraints? Gypsies with crystal balls? 
Do they do what everyone else is doing? Or, maybe, just give some kindergar-
teners a box of Crayolas? The reality is that asset allocation does not control 
return; the investments or investment managers do. Asset  allocation con-
trols risk. Yes, the two are interrelated, and one does have an impact on the 
other, but it is helpful for committee members to think about them separately: 
investment managers control return and asset allocation controls risk. Your 
investment officer may have a slightly more sophisticated way of looking at 
these two and see more of the interrelationships; but then he would, wouldn’t 
he? As a base case for both the committee and the investment staff, this split is 
helpful and useful. One more thought about asset allocation: it does not exist 
as a complete and separate entity; it is actually two separate parts.
The National Association of College and University Business Officers 
(NACUBO) publishes a study of investments for over 800 organizations. 
From the 2013 study, we can compare the returns and allocations of three 
marquee universities with the average of all the universities, and with one 
private foundation (see Figures 14-1 to Figure 14-4). Obviously the same or 
similar allocations for the marquee three and the average university resulted in 
different performance results, but conversely, different allocations between the 
marque three and the foundation resulted in similar returns. QED; allocations 
did not cause returns.

What we hear called “asset  allocation” is in function two different activi-
ties: 1) the diversification and 2) the sizing of investments in our portfolios. 
Unfortunately, most think that adding one of every asset class they can dream 
up, coupled with weightings offered up by some “feeling,” is diversification. It 
is not. The asset classes are the first problem. Marketers have gotten carried 
away inventing new asset classes. Alternatives 25 years ago included inter-
national public equities; now they include collateralized loan obligations, dis-
tressed debt, special situations, middle market buyouts, and so forth, the point 
being that the “names” of the asset classes themselves are meaningless. Take 
for example, a private equity fund that invested capital into Chrysler (a private 
company) versus a fund focused on large-cap public equities that invested

capital in Ford. How is Chrysler as a private company really any different than 
Ford as a public one? Both are impacted by the same economic winds. I am 
not arguing that you should not have both (or one over the other), but I am 
saying that if you do, you have concentrated the portfolio, not diversified it. 
This may be a good thing; you may make tons of money (at least we hope so), 
but it is not risk-reducing, and it is certainly not diversification. Real diversi-
fication is achieved by holding assets (investments) affected by (1) different 
information streams, (2) differing techniques for turning that information into 
return, and (3) differing risks. It is the opportunity to find differences along 
one or more of these three axes that creates the diversification. That reduces 
risk, not the name of the class itself.
For example (staying in the private equity class for a while, as proxy for the 
whole portfolio), a portfolio consisting of a fund-of-funds of only venture capi-
tal funds, or a portfolio of LBO funds, is vastly different and much less diversi-
fied than a portfolio that includes a fund of growth equity in China, a fund of 
small hydro plants in Brazil, and a fund of quick-serve restaurants in southeast-
ern U.S. The first two portfolios are not diversified well, but the last one most 
certainly is. To make diversification work at all, one must have investments 
that are different on all (or as many as possible) of these three axes. Different 
names to classes of asset just aren’t enough.
Next is the whole concept of correlation. Correlation should be thrown 
out of our lexicon and minds forever. The issue is connectedness, not some 
mathematical folderol. How closely are the assets connected, on which axis 
are they connected, and most importantly, when do they become connected? 
These are the real questions. Anything can be correlated and not connected. 
Many can remember when hemlines and the World Series winner were “cor-
related with” and “predicted” the stock market. But these days, we don’t bet 
on hemlines.
Correlation is an attempt to measure the connectiveness of investments, but 
those connections are made between individual managers or investments, not 
the name of some group of assets grouped into a bucket and called a class. 
Even pair-wise correlation is a crutch that is often wrong and almost always 
changes over short amounts of time. The math is not wrong; it just lacks 
any real investment world application. Down in the rocks and shoals of daily 
investing, correlations sometimes exist for a bit, then change dramatically to 
a new set, which lasts until the next change. These periods reflect the indi-
vidual relationship of each of the two investments to one another and the 
actual market and economic environments (the information streams and even 
execution methods). As the environment changes, so does the correlation. 
What matters is: In which environment are they acting in concert?

Chapter 14 | The Right Way to View Asset Allocation
80
Some assets/investments are connected with soft bonds, like large-cap value 
and small-cap growth funds. For some part of a market downdraft they act 
unconnected, but if the markets fall far enough (or rise high/fast enough) they 
show their connectivity and move together. Why is that? We hear from our 
consultant friends that during market turmoil all correlations go to one; if so, 
what good are they? In reality, if in these market tumbles all correlations go 
to one, then shouldn’t we really want a correlation of one when they go up 
as well? The key to good asset allocation is to find the connections between 
investments and to ensure that they are as far apart (as unconnected) as pos-
sible and to know (or at least suspect) what might cause them to work in 
concert.
In the following two chapters, we will discuss the two components of asset allo-
cation: diversification and sizing of investments. Expecting diversification alone, 
or in conjunction with proper sizing, to insulate your portfolio from all shocks 
is as silly as expecting your kitchen knife to cut everything and anything. Using 
only asset allocation to manage your portfolio is like having only a hammer in 
your toolbox. It is only one of several tools that can be used, and if used cor-
rectly, it will help. Let allocation do its job and don’t try to make it do every-
thing. Managing a portfolio is not a one-tool job. Try using other tools, such as 
liquidity, volatility, risk, and quality.
Figure 14-5 to  Figure 14-8 show the actual total performance of a fund 
compared to the hypothetical performance if one had used asset class 
indexes in exactly the same proportions. Obviously manager selection and 
not asset allocation created performance.

What 
Diversification 
Really Means
Diversification is not an end unto itself. More and more diversification is not 
necessarily helpful at all. The thing is, concentration adds to return and diver-
sification removes risk, but both only to a point. So which is it that you need, 
a more concentrated or a more diversified portfolio? This is a question with-
out an answer. There is no science to balancing these two—just art. As we 
will see in the chapter on allocation process, we can determine if an added 
manager reduces risk or not and by how much. We also can see what effect 
the new investment may have on the expected return and the right (good) 
side of the return distribution, but when is enough enough? The easy answer 
is that it depends. Certainly once a new investment stops subtracting risk or 
adding return, you have reached enough. Before that point however, it will 
only be your sense that your efforts toward risk and return have balanced 
one another.
In a general sense, as you or your investment officer add unconnected invest-
ments, you are increasing the probability of success but also reducing the 
returns that are possible. High average returns are part of reducing risk, and 
do provide a buffer for those inevitable down drafts. Also, part of your effort 
to reduce risk should be focused on the specific events you can forecast and 
the investments that have a high probability of impacting them. This part is 
less science and, again, more art. Are you forecasting inflation, geo-political 
disruptions, resurgence of particular markets, strong growth in particular

­segments, bursting of market bubbles, or a change in political direction? What 
about a change in your need for cash, perhaps due to a big project or new 
grant program? Once these events are identified, the question then becomes, 
What investment will best push the portfolio in the direction you want, or 
do you have enough already in the portfolio? If not, more investments will be 
required—more “diversification,” if you like.
The discussion of what constitutes diversification is an “inside baseball” dis-
cussion. Academics and most consultants tout “classes” of assets, while some 
CIOs and a few consultants like the “buckets” approach. Both depend on cor-
relation coefficient calculations, which become their weak link. Correlations 
are a weak reed upon which to base decisions. The story is that you want 
investments that are correlated such that when one investment is up, the 
other is down. Hogwash is the nicest term we can use here. You already know 
that when markets are strongly down, all correlations become one; in other 
words, they all go down together. Those that live on correlations must then 
believe that when markets go up, they want part of their portfolio to go down, 
so that when markets go down all of their investments can go down as well, 
and the correlation stays low. If you buy the correlation theory, what you 
really want is a correlation of one, so when the markets go up so do all your 
investments, because when the markets are down you know all your invest-
ments will be down too. Following that line of thought, we would just ignore 
correlation.
Too often, people equate correlation with connectivity. You can talk about 
the correlation of the markets with ladies’ skirt length, and with who won 
a sports game, or a particular year in a President’s term, but no one really 
believes that skirt lengths or the number of years a President has been in 
office determine the market.
What we are trying to do when we diversify is to control the connectivity 
between our investments, or find investments that are not connected at all. 
The way to do that is not by assigning different names to asset classes or dif-
ferent buckets of investments. It is to focus on those areas that are or may be 
common to each investment. The three biggest elements or vectors on which 
to diversify are (1) information stream, (2) execution and (3) unique risks.
Let’s take three private equity funds that all fit into the private equity bucket 
of the alternative asset class and explore just what we mean by these three 
diversification vectors. The three are a growth equity fund in China, an energy 
fund in Brazil, and a micro LBO fund specializing in fast food restaurants in the 
southeastern U.S. These were actual funds in an actual portfolio. We are using 
these three because the differences are easy to see, but the principles apply 
to every manager in your portfolio.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
85
Information stream is the how and where does the manager get information.  
Research, sure, but what research, what markets, and what sub-parts of the 
market? Do they have something extra, some secret sauce or some lagniappe? 
These three example funds are all private equity, but one fishes from  
consumer-based growing companies with revenue in China, another uses 
only guaranteed contracts for energy in Brazil, and the last fishes from small 
franchise restaurants one or two at a time. A change in the U.S. has little 
connection with any of them. Take-or-pay energy contracts in Brazil have no  
connection to non-export consumer businesses in China, and going out  
to Taco Bell has nothing to do with China or Brazil, and a limited amount to 
do with the state of the economy in the U.S.
Even in the small-cap value asset class, two managers can use different sources 
of information; one can focus on IPO and mutual insurance conversions and 
the other on turnaround or underperforming names. The information stream 
will include all the data they use to track names in their space. One micro-cap 
manager added to his normal research through a massive Rolodex of individuals  
that he could call to get information—not inside, just public information that 
was not followed widely by most analysts.
Execution is the process the manager uses to convert the information into 
return. Back to our special three: The China group plots growth and focuses 
on the ability of the company to IPO or sell to a strategic buyer in a short 
time, the Brazil group on the ability to build and then contract for long-term 
delivery of electricity, and the Taco Bell fund rolls up those small franchises 
into one and relies on the economy of scale. Some equity managers use 
momentum and some use a discount cash flow or dividend approach.
Unique risks are just that: what will cause a particular manager to under 
perform? The unique risks of the three private equity managers are easier to see, 
but unique risks exist for domestic managers as well. One may be sensitive 
to interest rates, another to a regional economy and a third to regulatory 
approval or changes. The list is almost endless (unfortunately). The fewer 
shared risks the better the diversification.

Asset Allocation: 
The Process
Start with the end in mind.
—Stephen Covey
Currently, the starting point for investing in the industry is to assign various 
investments to differing buckets or asset classes, and then optimize the sizing 
of each bucket based on the average performance of the asset class, with the 
goal of reaching some “efficient frontier.” First the investment committee or 
consultant decides how many and which buckets to name. Then they decide 
which bucket each investment belongs to. Some can be easy, but others not 
so much. Should this investment be called distressed debt, or is it high-yield? 
Does the high-yield manager fit into the fixed income class or alternative 
class? Is international equity separate from domestic equity or are they both 
part of global equity or is it an alternative? Does an equity mutual fund of 
natural resource commodities heavily biased to international names fit into 
the alternative box, or the international equity box, or is it a new class—
natural resources? Where do you put MLPs and REITs? After you decide on 
which bucket each belongs to, the next decision is how much of each bucket 
you want. Into the machine goes these several decisions, and like the Great 
Wizard of Oz out comes the answer. The next step is then to find filler for 
each bucket. The actual investment manager or investment used to fill the 
bucket is often the one who is on the consultant’s list or platform, and not 
necessarily the “best” or even “good” for your portfolio.

Chapter 16 | Asset Allocation: The Process

Asset allocation like this is probably responsible for more failed performance 
than any other element of investing. One cannot separate allocation from 
manager selection and risk control. Asset allocation is the result of the portfolio-
building process, not the start. This is crucial to successful investing.
Deciding that a certain percentage of your portfolio needs to be in any par-
ticular asset class is an exercise in hubris. Who can know in advance which 
managers one can find, or the state of risk? Does one add in any old manager 
just to satisfy an allocation percentage pulled from space? Where did that per-
centage come from—someone else’s allocation? What risk did that fund take? 
What were their goals? A manager that fits the portfolio is more important 
than mere participation in some ill-defined asset class like “alternative” or 
“emerging market” or even “large-cap value.” Building an iron box in advance 
and forcing your portfolio to fit that box would make Procrustes proud.
One state teachers’ pension fund was convinced that they needed a certain 
percentage allocation to private equity. They were told it would take sev-
eral years to find the right (diversified) funds for this $300 million allocation, 
because not all the best were in the market at the time. They were also cau-
tioned about the “J-curve” effect. They ignored the advice and committed the 
entire amount inside of a couple of months. They were a little big for that bed 
and so were severely chopped off, losing a significant amount of money.
The key to controlling a portfolio is diversification; a simple idea, but not so 
simple to execute. In fact, building a diversified portfolio is difficult because 
it requires deep thought and an understanding of the investment. This is the 
area that separates the middling investment officers from the outstanding 
ones. The average investment officer, average consultant, or average invest-
ment committee member thinks (because they have been told far too often), 
that diversification is a simple effort and that many differently named asset 
classes are all that is needed. The real truth is that asset classes don’t pro-
vide diversification; they are used by academics only because they are easy to 
name, and the data is easy to get.
Rethinking the process 
So how can a foundation or endowment allocate assets to control their risk? 
To start, they would look to the end point, their goal. If they don’t have a des-
tination, they won’t get there except by chance. If return is not already stated 
as a percentage, you will need to convert your goal into a percentage. This 
becomes not your target return, but your minimum return. Anything more is 
wonderful and anything less is a failure.
Starting the process, not unreasonably, starts with the grist in your mill—
the diverse package of managers you have found. Using a field of potential 
investments as a core and then simulating (Monte Carlo) builds a distribution 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
89
of potential returns. You can start with a single manager or a small bloc of 
managers. Selecting these managers en bloc is required only when starting this 
process for the first time, or occasionally to test the portfolio. Once the fund 
is established, each newly suggested investment is modeled into the portfolio 
to see if the probabilities improve or not. The fund can test whether or not 
replacing a manager is helpful or if making a change to governance helps, or it 
can test a new type of asset or investment to see if it makes a difference, and 
if so, how much.
Businesslike decisions can be made. Implementing socially responsible invest-
ing rules is a business decision. Do social investing rules help or not? If they 
don’t, how much in terms of risk will it cost to use them anyway? How much 
will it cost to dedicate a portion of the fund to short-term bonds in order to 
pay for a particular need? For example: one foundation wanted to exclude sin 
stocks. After evaluating, they discovered that decision was worth $1,000,000 
annually in potential returns, so since that million would feed and house many 
children in the orphanages the foundation supported, they decided that it was 
just fine that smokers and drinkers supported these activities. A note here: 
this was done with the managers available at that time, the market at that time, 
and within their governance set. It may or may not be different now and with 
different governance. A second example: one hospital made large changes to 
their portfolio at the end of a bad year in the market—against advice—which 
cost them $87 million in the first year. An “expensive good night’s sleep,” to 
quote someone there. They did not test beforehand.
Simulation is not a black box approach. Will it give you precisely accurate 
numbers? Don’t count on it. What it will do is get you close to the magnitude 
of the change and accurately give the direction of the change. Is there much 
difference in saying that there is a 95% vs. 96% chance of success? No, but 
there is a big difference if the numbers are 90% vs. 97%. It is a big flag if they 
move either up or down with whatever change was contemplated? In the hos-
pital example above, the predicted cost, had they tested beforehand, was$60 
million, less than the $87 million it actually cost. Either way, an expensive deci-
sion. Would they have made the same decision if they had examined the cost 
in advance? No one can ever know for sure.
We like a step-by-step approach because you can monitor the process and 
see where changes are coming from. Assuming you are starting from scratch, 
that process would look like this:
Core
To make it easier and quicker, we generally start with a small select group 
of listed equity managers. They are generally domestic, but on occasion may 
include a global listed equity manager(s) as well; you can start with just one 
single manager; the process is exactly the same.

Chapter 16 | Asset Allocation: The Process
90
Once you have identified your base group of managers, you can simulate pos-
sible returns and get a cumulative probability set or a distribution of returns. 
This set of probabilities tells us not what will happen but what the chances 
of a certain return or more happening will be, on average. This is a lot like 
rolling a pair of dice; we don’t know exactly the next roll, but do know that 
the probability of rolling more than a three is high (in fact, it is 33 out of 36, 
or 91.7%). Once we have this return set with the managers, we can simply 
choose the return we are interested in, our minimum required return, (for a 
foundation this might equal spending + CPI + maybe something extra), and 
read the probability of achieving that return or better. Changing managers 
or changing allocated amounts will change this probability, which will in turn 
change our risk of failure. You can try out various options to find the optimal 
one. It will be the one with the highest chance of success and lowest chance 
for failure. If you started with a few managers, you may change them out one 
at a time with different potential managers to see which would be the better 
set. This approach gives you a core or base to your portfolio with a certain 
level of risk.
Absolute
Next, begin adding other managers and investments that tend to skew the dis-
tribution further or make it more peaked, in order to continue to lower the 
risk of failure (increase the chance of success). Always, always ensure that the 
managers add diversification to the portfolio. Remember, diversify along three 
axes: (1) information stream, (2) style of conversion of information to return, 
and (3) risks. For this phase, you must find investments that have a more regular 
return and stray little from their mean, like fixed income, or investments that 
act like fixed income. These investments may have lower returns than your 
average, maybe even lower than your required return (though high-return 
options are certainly welcome and can sometimes be found). The steadiness 
of these investments helps especially during those times that are outsized 
on the low side, but then may hurt the portfolio when returns are outsized 
on the high side. You can think of this as giving up return to buy insurance. 
This makes sense as long as the added investment(s) lower the probability of 
failure. There is no sense in adding a large contingent of bonds (or any other 
investment) to the portfolio if the chance of reaching the required return goes 
down. Keep adding more and more of that particular manager, pushing down 
the risk, until the risk starts to rise. You are done; the investment or manager 
is properly sized.
This is the biggest fault of pension plans (especially public ones). They like to 
add very low returns in order to get very low volatility. The fund needs to 
make a certain required absolute return in order to pay benefits, and they end 
up carrying so much fixed income or low returning hedge funds in order to 
ensure low volatility, they never get to the required return, which is a failure.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
91
One state pension plan has a statutory requirement of 30% for fixed income. 
How can legislators know in advance the right amount of bonds? With ten-
year bonds in the 2-3% range, right now they should not be surprised that 
they can’t meet their obligations. What do they tell employees? “You can’t 
have your retirement payment, but look. . .no volatility!”
Enhanced
The next set of managers or investments to add are the long-ball hitters, the 
expanded or enhanced return generators. Add these like you did the steady 
eddies and pull the return distribution back up, increasing returns but still 
decreasing the probability of failure. Add as much as you can until you can no 
longer increase the chances for a win.
Yes, these investments are much more risky individually, but adding a bit into 
the mix can, and does, reduce the risk of failure.
This approach gives you a method of evaluating the “goodness” of a manager 
or allocation. Good for you, that is good for the portfolio, means this manager 
or this investment or this allocation is a positive influence on the portfolio by 
increasing the chance for success. At exactly the same time as you are evaluat-
ing managers, you are sizing the allocation and adjusting risk in the portfolio. 
A great manager may well have great track record, but if he does not help the 
portfolio, why would you include him?
A special note here: using this approach means using managers with skewed 
and peaked return distributions, such that there are many more good things 
happening in the portfolio than bad. This most often eliminates CTAs (com-
modity traders) because they have many more bad returns than good, even if 
the occasional great return pulls up their average returns. This is often their 
marketing cry: that they are not correlated with other investments, and using 
them will lower volatility. We are maximizing the probability of success, not 
minimizing volatility; checks are not written in deviations, standard or not.
This approach gives the investment committee the ability to make knowledge-
able businesslike decisions. They can evaluate the cost in terms of risk or dollars  
in making or not making a certain investment. One could look at the cost of 
using or not using hedge funds or international stocks or almost anything.
Event Risks
The next step is to look for outside risks, those known or unknown elements 
that, if they happen, would have a big negative effect on the portfolio. Then find 
investments that insure against that risk. (The word “hedge” used to be used, 
but now it conjures up different images, mostly of excess fees). For example: 
in a geo-politically unstable world, oil might be good insurance (so, perhaps, is 
the dollar). In an environment with rapidly growing economies, investments in 
emerging countries and natural resources are a good hedge to events. In an 

Chapter 16 | Asset Allocation: The Process
92
era of inflation, real estate is often a good bet, but so are natural resources. 
The threat of down markets points to investments that are not marked to 
market frequently, such as private equity or perhaps even cash.
As you identify these event risks, look to your portfolio to see if you already 
have some investments that will backstop or insure against that risk. If not, 
add a manager or investment that will. Using the same approach as above, you 
can see if there is a cost in risk or potential return and balance it against the 
insurance you hope to get from the investment. You may find that increasing 
your risk is necessary to insure against whatever event is of concern.
Liquidity
The next step is to layer on any liquidity requirements, spending, benefit pay-
ments, and the like. It is important to remember that the entire equity port-
folio is liquid; you do not need to match income or dividends with expenses 
(we are investors, not accountants). Trying to match income and expenses is 
not a best practice, since it reduces your total return. It is not uncommon to 
think, since equity markets are both up and down, that in the future you may 
need money when the market might be down, and therefore cash needs to 
be set aside now. That is not always the case. If you are earning, for example, 
10% annually in the portfolio, even if the portfolio is down several percentage 
points, the resultant return may still be better than a money market over the 
same period of time. The comparison is of total dollars earned over the time 
period. One technique used heavily by corporate America, but not often by 
foundations or endowments, is the letter of credit.
The endowment model so often discussed includes the notion of selling 
liquidity. If your fund invests too heavily in private deals and has a liquidity 
crisis during a big sell-off of the equity markets, which happened in 2008, a 
standby source of short-term funds is most welcome and demonstrates supe-
rior prior planning. Why foundation CFOs and treasurers don’t use letters of 
credit more often has always been a wonder to me; they should certainly be 
considered.
Tilt
As things change, or we think they might change, in the short run we could 
tilt the portfolio slightly to take advantage of the opportunity, or to avoid the 
risk. As we artificially increase some or decrease other investments, we can go 
back to the simulation process to measure any increased risk, which helps us 
gauge just how much tilt to put into place. An important note to remember: 
a tilt need not be made, and in fact we recommend few and generally only 
small tilts at that.

This is partly philosophical. If you were so good at picking (anything), you 
would do it and forgo a well-balanced or managed portfolio. You are not, and 
therefore should hold a position near the managed portfolio. This core or 
baseline portfolio is the answer to the question, “What do we do when we 
don’t know what to do?”
The Whole
Taken step by step, this seems like a linear process—one is done, then the 
next, but in fact, all are done together, or more accurately, a little of one then 
a little of the next, and so on. This recursive rework of the portfolio is to find 
the optimal set of managers and allocations. Remember that, while this pro-
cess seems incredibly precise, it is just not accurate. Therefore your “alloca-
tions” are often round numbers, and sometimes tied to minimum investment 
amounts.
The portfolio is now “allocated,” at least for the moment, until something 
changes.
Conclusion
Gather the best managers you can find who have the return distributions that 
you need, and then, using simulation, allocate among them to find a sufficiently 
high return at a low level of risk. Then find asset classes and investments that 
will address event risks and opportunities and add them in, using the same 
simulation method. What matters is the return needed at a desired risk level, 
not whether or not a popular asset class is included or even if all classes are 
included. This is important: Not all asset classes or even the popular ones or 
newest ones need to be in your portfolio; just the ones that help it. You are 
solving a problem, not sampling every dish on the menu.
Allocation is under continuous review as conditions change in the economy 
or markets, and is entirely driven by your needs and perceived future risks. 
Allocations are (or should be) adjusted to control risk, and risk is forecasted 
(ex-ante), not reported (ex-post), as with standard deviation. Rebalancing is 
continual, but should not be done without thought. Letting winners run for a 
while is not a bad thing for the portfolio (the extent to which you let them 
run is a policy and governance issue) and always maintaining a stable risk pro-
file is imperative.

Portfolio 
Evaluation
You can observe a lot just by watching.
—Yogi Berra
“The only reason for the assets are the liabilities” is a mantra that used to be 
heard frequently, but not so much anymore. Why hold back, or save, or avoid 
spending money, unless you have a reason or purpose for that money some-
time in the future? Those future needs, for which we hold funds, are simply 
liabilities. For pension plans, it’s easy for your actuary to assume the future 
benefit payroll attached to each employee, then once that total future payroll 
is estimated, discount it back at some assumed rate of return to today. That 
number can be compared to the assets on hand. For endowments and founda-
tions, it is a much more direct proposition. They have a required payout that 
must be met, and often target a higher number to account for inflation or they 
have a specific budget amount that needs to be met. These requirements are 
the liabilities that must be covered and are the only reason for the assets.
Do employees or grant recipients really care if the S&P or some “policy” 
index got beat? Do benefit checks or grants get paid in dollars, or “relatives to 
the index?” On every check I’ve seen (and the only ones we want), that long 
middle line always ends in “dollars,” never “relatives” or “frontiers” (efficient 
or not). The first and only goal of a pension plan must be to pay those bills—
now and future. The first and only goal of a foundation or endowment is to 
pay their obligations and fund their programs—now and future. So how do 
trustees measure how well they are doing? How do they evaluate the need 
for change, and just how do they manage the fund?
17

First, and foremost, they have to define their job. Presumably, they did this 
in their governance document. It should not be to beat some popular index 
or even a policy index, nor is it to beat Dallas Police and Fire, Yale, or your 
favorite competitor, nor is it to do better than other “funds like ours.” Their 
first job is to pay those liabilities when they are due. They must fund their 
programs and budget share. Anything else is not acting in the best interests of 
the fund, is disloyal, and shows a lack of care.
Yale professor emeritus James Tobin writes: “Trustees are the guardians of 
the future against the claims of the present. Their task is to preserve equity 
among generations.”1
The only true benchmark is therefore the liability (benefit) itself—but that 
slippery devil is different for each particular fund. In theory, it should be simple; 
just figure out what checks will be needed from now until “far in the future” 
and calculate an average rate of return needed by each contribution to get 
to that number. From the trustee’s point of view, all that is needed is to earn 
that rate or better—right? In a world where crystal balls work (or towers are 
ivory) the answer would be yes. Otherwise, no.
The current fad is the “policy index,” where the investment committee takes 
the preselected asset allocation weights multiplied by their individual indexes or 
benchmark returns to create a unique benchmark return that reflects “policy.” 
Since that policy benchmark is calculated with average asset class returns and 
the investment committee would never hire or keep a below-average manager 
(at least in theory), it becomes a virtual guarantee that the fund will beat that 
policy index and will be successful. Unfortunately, much of the time many funds 
simply don’t exceed the policy index, and when they do there may be no real 
success because they don’t meet the required return.
Example: Not long ago, a state-run pension plan had beat its policy benchmark 
by over 200 basis points, and for that stunning success its staff awarded them-
selves almost $2 million in bonuses. Just too bad the fund missed its required return 
by almost 300 basis points. Better luck next time, employees, and thanks for the  
new car.
The questions that are almost never asked are, “Why is this the policy?,” 
“What is the purpose of this policy?,” “Where did we get this policy?,” and 
most importantly, “Will this policy get us where we need to be?”
Another common evaluation tool is the watch list. A manager underperforms 
for some specified period of time, therefore he is put on a “watch list” (what, 
no one was watching before?). Then he is given some specified period of time 
1James Tobin, “What is Permanent Endowment Income?”, American Economic Review 64, no. 
2(1974): 427-432.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
97
to improve. The question never asked is Why? Why is he underperforming? Is 
there a reason? Could it be due to their philosophy, and the failure should be 
expected given the current market conditions? Is the intellectual capital gone? 
If so, why wait to find a new manager? Is it something that can be fixed? If so, 
what are you (or the manager) doing about it, and if it’s not fixable, why wait? 
This brings up a corollary: Why is the consultant or your investment officer 
reluctant to fire this manager now? They may have a reason, but this is a rea-
son that must be explained and justified to the committee.
Change is one of the key elements you should be tracking. First, are there 
changes to your goals, requirements and restrictions? Are there changes to 
your feelings toward risk, and how might that affect the portfolio? Next, are 
there changes at the managers? Is performance not what it should be or was 
expected to be? Did someone holding the intellectual capital leave, are there 
other changes at the firm, or has the firm been sold? The list is almost endless. 
The only thing you can be absolutely sure of is that things will change, and you 
must be out in front of them if you can, and not far behind if you can’t.
The real benchmark is that minimum or required return. Are you getting there? 
Are you keeping that compound return over multiple periods of time—one, 
three, five or more years? If you did or did not get the required return this 
evaluation period, was this one of those left-hand-tail events and you are keep-
ing up the required compound return over the life of the portfolio, or not?
Your portfolio is a team of real people making decisions and performing each 
and every day. They are not unlike a ball team when individual players under- 
and overperform in a particular game. Their performance this month or this 
game is part of the evaluation, but not all of it. Yes, comparing each manager 
to his peers and to benchmarks can be helpful in managing the portfolio, but 
only in a general way. It is not uncommon to find good managers that simply 
do not look like the index they are paired with. They don’t track nor do they 
have many of the characteristics of that index. We know one small-cap growth 
manager that sometimes has a decided value component (growth at a price?) 
and will let the cap size rise without selling. One name we remember ran from 
a small capitalization to a large capitalization because it could produce signifi-
cant growth for the portfolio. The manager was more interested in managing 
our money than he was in maintaining a particular look for the consulting 
industry—by any definition, a good manager.
As fiduciaries and members of the governance of a fund, your benchmark is the 
goal of the fund. Is your investment office, the management of the investments, 
meeting that goal? All the other benchmarks, comparisons, and statistics are 
simply flags or point to questions for that investment officer. Does he or she 
know the answer? Can they say why? Are they out in front or just sitting back 
and waiting? They are for you to monitor and evaluate—manage—while they 
monitor, evaluate and manage the investments.

When You  
Don’t Know 
What to Do
Things done well and with a care, exempt themselves from fear.
—William Shakespeare
Uncertainties can paralyze decision-making, or, even worse, compel investors 
to base their actions on gut feelings and little else. Uncertainty and fear can’t 
be analyzed away. You are not trying to develop the best solution to one or 
even two events for your portfolio, but a good solution to many events. Then 
adapt as things develop over time. Using the simulation method, you balance 
simplicity and relevance by considering a likely set of events and the reaction 
to them by your managers, plus a likely set of outlier events and your possible 
responses to them. Experience and an understanding of the managers’ histo-
ries guide the analysis. Knowing and tracking changes in the inputs (managers) 
is the most important part, and the only way you can be assured of a reason-
able outcome. By considering only the most relevant factors to success, your 
investment officer is able to manage the complexity of the analysis, save time 
and identify the leeway they can give to each manager. In the end, they are 
investing for the next period, not reacting to the last.
Starting with a set of “good” managers to construct your portfolio and build-
ing the portfolio as we have discussed, you will have created a baseline or 
foundation portfolio. Keeping your eye on those risks that may impact your 
18

goal, and allowing yourself to adapt to change, you can be assured that you can 
be successful in the midst of chaos. You will always know what to do, because 
you have a plan—a base portfolio.
This is where the difference between governing models using an investment 
office, using a consultant, or especially doing it yourself becomes apparent. 
When a fund uses an investment officer (whatever his or her strategy for 
investing is) they get a planned long-term strategy, a baseline that can be used 
to accomplish a certain goal. That investment officer is personally and contin-
uously invested in the performance and the progress toward the goal(s). The 
investments are coordinated, and tend to work with each other. Interrelated 
risks can be evaluated and managed. The board can focus on governance and 
evaluation.
When things are in chaos, when there is proverbial blood in the streets, when 
you are uncertain and don’t know what to do, your baseline portfolio does. 
That baseline portfolio is the place to be. The simulation to develop a distri-
bution of possible returns showed you that there could be, and that there 
are, times of extreme returns, but that over time the compound average will 
approach its mean, or at the very least the returns over time will exceed your 
required return. Each individual manager is dealing with the problems in a 
small subset of investments using the skill you hired. You layered the portfolio 
with protections (hedges) for these and even more extreme events. Trust that 
the line will hold. Decisions made in a calm, deliberative, and unstressed man-
ner will outperform decisions made under stress and without deliberation. 
That is why good pilots think through their reaction to inflight emergencies 
on the ground, when they can work through the knock-on issues, and why 
well-run investment portfolios have a plan.
Holding to your baseline portfolio when frightened, uncertain or lost is sim-
ply the best and only solution. One large fund failed to hold to their baseline 
portfolio just after the debacle in the markets of 2008. Frightened for their 
reputations if they did not have the funds to complete a building program, 
they bailed. They sold everything liquid and put it into short-term bonds. This 
move cost $87 million in the first year, and because they were unwilling to 
either admit a bad move or fix it or to “time” the markets (neatly forgetting 
they had already done so), they lost $200 million over the next three years. 
Unfortunately, they were not the only ones to do so; many other foundations 
have done the same or similar things.
Part of the initial decision of portfolio strategy is often not deliberated or 
even consciously made. It is this decision that later causes much of the dis-
comfort as the market or economy changes. There are two points of attitude 
toward a fund and its planed performance. The first is called “maxi-max” and 
is the intention or attitude that maximum effort should be made to maxi-
mize returns. The second, called “maxi-min,” is that maximum effort should 
be made to minimize risk (loss). One works great until a big drop in the fund, 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
101
and the other works until the board sees others with huge profits. At those 
points of inflection, the pressure is to switch to the other variant, and of 
course this is often a big mistake. A path in between, a middle road, is often 
the best, and is easiest to maintain in crisis. That middle road is your baseline 
portfolio. It will give you strong performance, although perhaps not the very 
top performance, and will help you minimize loss, although again perhaps not 
as small as some. In the long run, this baseline portfolio will ensure you have 
a corpus that will support current and expanded programs or an expanding 
share of budget support.
Realize that investment is risky, and some amount of risk is appropriate and 
that some amount of return is also appropriate. Planning for and building a 
portfolio to accomplish this and then holding to the plan at those crisis points 
will be the most successful path.

The Nature  
of Fees
Penny-wise and pound-foolish
—Old English maxim
Fees often become the primary evaluation tool for many trustees because 
they are the most easily discovered and dealt with in the few hours each quar-
ter that attention is given to the portfolio. Accounting (adding and subtract-
ing) is something trustees know well, while discovering and tracking skills and 
processes are not. There is sometimes also a bit of resentment at the levels 
of income possessed by these managers (especially when these managers are 
really arrogant about it). Then there is that F word—fiduciary. Many think that 
being a fiduciary is all, or at least mostly, about watching the checkbook.
Fees are important; there is no denying that. But the fees you see are not 
always the ones you end up paying. Investment managers are doing a signifi-
cant amount of work and should be paid, even paid well, just not overpaid 
or secretly paid. Fees are important because both paying too much and pay-
ing too little will have an impact on your fund. Evaluation by the committee 
should not start and stop at the size of the fee, but on the value received. It 
is important that all the cost—observable fees, hidden fees and opportunity 
costs—be evaluated. One large brokerage firm (a new term is “investment 
bank,” a newer term is “wealth manager”) touts that it does not charge any-
thing for the execution of share trades if you use its managers. Right, and “the 
check is in the mail” and “I’m from the government and here to help you.” You 
pay for everything, and if it is hidden you often pay too much.
19
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 19 | The Nature of Fees 
104
An aside about fees, or more appropriately, expenses: if you are seeing a high 
turnover in your investment officers, you are either not paying enough or are 
hiring junior guys who leave when they have learned enough to step up to a 
bigger fund.
A word of caution here. The financial industry is the most dangerous place for 
the unknowing, the naïve, the incautious, the unaware, the gullible, the uniniti-
ated. . . in other words, the average board member. This is not a place for part-
time sailors; there be monsters, rocks and shoals in these waters. We don’t 
mean that it is rife with scams and illegality. Yes, they do exist, but the SEC has 
had a dampening effect, with some notable exceptions.
What we are cautioning you about are the common practices that either are 
not illegal or just can’t be found by regulators. The common assumption is 
that if you are on the investment committee for a large pool of money, you 
know what you are doing. This is not a place for learning about investments. 
Far too often, a person wants on the investment committee in order to learn 
about investments, and then learns they are not up to speed and turns to what 
the magazines, mutual fund sellers and personal wealth planers tout, which is 
a focus on fees.
Commissions, for example, are paid by the fund. Whenever your manager 
places a trade, the cost to the fund will range anywhere from a penny to four 
or five cents per share. The fund’s manager directs those trades, and when the 
trade is placed, the manager almost always gets a credit of some part of the 
commission to spend almost however he wants. These are called soft dollars, 
and are legal, but are, in my opinion, just not right. This is not what you want to 
happen. Those are the fund’s moneys, so if you want to pay for the manager’s 
“research,” or equipment, go ahead. But if not, don’t and make the manager 
pay for it out of their fees. After all, isn’t that what the fees are for? How to 
do so is simple: require that the manager use a broker that will rebate those 
excess commissions to you, not to them, or who will simply charge much less. 
The fund’s consultant or investment officer will know how, but the committee 
must make sure they do so. Many consultants and some investment officers 
just want to be friends with the manager, hoping for more business, or not 
wanting to confront the manager. If the commissions are zero, look hard at the 
trade execution price—you may be paying more than you should.
Charging a commission to investments traded net (profit, fee, and commission 
already built in), or cutting the visible commission and then trading principal 
at a higher price, are just two ways to take a little more. This is common with 
some of the “discount” brokers who charge a fixed fee or low commissions, 
then trade at a price much higher than the volume weighted average price of 
the day.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
105
One investment manager practice, which was used in the past and probably 
still is, is charging a full, undiscounted fee and then each year the investment 
manager will write a large donation check back to the foundation. Not a kick-
back per se, but isn’t it nice to do business with such a generous patron of the 
organization? The foundation couldn’t fire this guy, he donates so much, right? 
This is different than the typical arrangement, where the investment manag-
ers will simply discount their fee from the beginning. Although the managers 
are charging (net) the same total dollars for their investment management 
services, the manager who writes the big donation check each year is given 
more leeway when it comes to performance because organizations just can’t 
quite give up that “donation.” One manager in Texas made a career and loads 
of money doing just that.
There is a corollary to this approach that does not involve donations, but 
social access, where the committee will accept higher fees or lower perfor-
mance because of some “benefit” of access to the board members of other 
foundations, or the advisory board of the manager, or maybe it’s just that 
expenses-paid “conference” held each year at Disney World in February.
Private equity and hedge funds are prime examples of fees that do need to be 
controlled. The long/short hedge fund manager that charges “2 and 20” and 
then delivers 5% net should be fired (hung if it were legal).. It is unconscio-
nable that someone would charge, much less pay, that much in fees for so little 
in return. If they returned you 25%, maybe. For many like this, it did not matter 
that these funds had a history of single-digit standard deviations. In 2008 they 
lost as much as any long-only fund, then gated so their clients could not get 
their money back.
Private equity managers often charge their fee on the total you have com-
mitted, which means you are paying fees on money you have not yet invested. 
Their argument about needing the revenue to employ good help holds water 
for the first and maybe second fund of small general partners, and while we 
don’t like it, we can live with it. For established general partners, they should 
be charging on deployed capital only. There are pressures now in the industry 
to bring those “2 and 20” fees down to more reasonable numbers. Always 
remember they are negotiable, and your consultant should be negotiating.
An important part of the investment function is the evaluation and control of 
fees. This is not the only function, nor are you required to take the smallest 
fee. The whole no-load mutual fund and index fund industries have been built 
on the premise that the best investment is the cheapest one, and free is best 
of all. It is far too easy to focus on the obvious price and miss the cost. Price 
is short term, and cost will go on for a much longer time. What is, or at least 
should be, important to a governing board is what the institution gets, not what 
the investment manager gets.

Investment 
Myths
The science of investing is infested with so many myths and old wives’ tales 
that even well-respected academics fail to question some of them. One well-
publicized economics professor has even pushed in his blog the index myth 
when some simple arithmetic would show it to be false. Here are some of 
the more egregious myths that have a serious impact on board members and 
investment officers and their ability to manage the investment portfolio.
Asset Allocation
One of the biggest myths in the industry, and the one that seems to be known 
by every foundation board member, is the one about asset allocation. In 1986, 
Brinson, Hood and Bebower, and then again in 1991 Brinson, Singer and 
Bebower, wrote papers that were picked up by many news outlets, consultants 
and the sellers of index funds. One of the newspapers misprinted the results 
of those studies and stated that 90+% of a portfolio’s returns were caused by 
asset allocation. Whether or not the mistake was intentional, it was picked up 
by the world as being true and has become now gospel.
Roger Ibbotson published a counter to that study, and Brinson himself spoke 
at many conferences denying the idea. What the study actually said was that 
90% of variation between any two funds was caused by asset allocation, which 
simply meant that if one fund had a 10% return and the other a 10.1% return, 
then 90% of the .1% was caused by asset allocation, not the whole 10.1%. A big 
difference from the reporting! Who would spend all that money on allocation 
studies or index funds for just that little bit?
20
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 20 | Investment Myths
108
Look at the allocations of the largest of the university endowments—Harvard, 
Yale, and Stanford—and compare them to the allocations used by the aver-
age university as reported by NACUBO. Not much difference. Then compare 
the performance of the three to the average university—a big difference. The 
marquee three had an average performance of 9.81% annualized from 2003 
to 2013, vs. 6.72% for the average university. These marquee universities aver-
aged an allocation of 34% in equity, 12% in fixed income and 55% in alterna-
tives. The average university was similar, with allocations of 40%, 15%, and 42% 
respectively. Allocation did not control 90% of their returns.
Index
The corollary to the asset allocation myth and a close cousin to the Alpha 
myth (see the following section) is the index myth. Proponents of the index 
myth, often sellers of index funds (go figure), contend that no investment 
manager can beat the index for long, and therefore there is no sense in trying. 
What is difficult about this myth is that it does hold some truth for boards 
or individuals without the time, education in investments, or desire to spend 
the time and education to invest as professionals. For them, index investing 
is probably a good idea, not because they can’t beat the index, but because 
they won’t do so. For institutional funds with boards that act professionally 
and actually care about the organization, it is possible to get someone with 
the time, education and experience to make the effort and to add value to the 
fund over time.
Alpha
The next of the great myths is that Alpha can’t be found over a long period 
of time. This is the silly one. Alpha has a technical calculation (in fact it has 
two), but the term is most commonly used just to describe that part of per-
formance that is above average. We have all heard the index fund salesmen 
and the professors of finance tell us nobody can beat the averages for long. 
At a conference in Portland for doctors, the speaker gave a talk in which he 
said that half of all doctors were below average. One bright fellow shot to his 
feet and announced that only 10% of all doctors were below average. You can 
guess which 10% he was in. We don’t know if it is that math is not taught in 
grade school anymore, or if we are living in Lake Wobegon, or that there is no 
longer a belief in exceptionalism. Average means the middle, and so by defini-
tion half must be bigger, more, or above.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
109
Whether we use an actual average or use an index, which is generally a man-
aged group of stocks, someone always does better and someone else does 
worse. If it were actually true that no one is exceptional, then Dr. Sharpe 
himself does not exist and Stanford is no better than Metro State College 
If it were true that those that have Alpha today must revert to the mean 
later, then Pavarotti or Michael Jordan could not have had careers, or that 
seven-foot center playing for the Nuggets would have had to take a nap in 
Procrustes’ bed.
Quality can be found; it exists everywhere. A particular investment manager 
can have alpha, but he might not have it forever. Pavarotti retired, you wouldn’t 
hire Jordan to play today, and someday even Warren Buffet will lose a step, 
but none of them will ever revert to being average. Talent, physical capital 
and intellectual capital all have a life cycle; they grow, peak for a time (long or 
short), and fall off. While a particular artist, ball player, professor or investment 
manager may not be above average forever, there is always a new guy to keep 
your fund above average forever.
Best Execution
Another of the great myths and another of the salesperson’s shibboleths is 
the one about “best execution.” Your money manager swears that his trader 
is always focused on getting you the best execution, and as such needs to con-
trol all trading. Thinking this through, however, one has to wonder; if you are 
getting the best execution, then the guy on the other side of the trade must 
be getting the worst execution, and if your manager is always getting the best 
of executions then everyone will want him to do all their trading. So then, who 
will be left to trade with?
This goes around and around. The simple truth is that there is no best execu-
tion, just fair, good and bad. Most trades are fair, where the buyer and seller get 
a fair price, the market at that time of trade with a small spread. A good trade 
is one done at a better price than the volume weighted average price, along 
with a small commission. A bad trade is the opposite. Can each of your trades 
be good? Not every one will be, but most can, if you use a good institutional 
broker and direct your manager to use them to trade.
The manager or broker consultant will spend a great deal of time explaining 
how they need these trades to get “best execution.” What they actually want 
is the excess commission—the soft dollars to pay for whatever they want 
(they say research, but it could be almost anything). The reality is that these 
excess commissions are the foundation’s; the manager is already charging fees 
for his efforts, and there is no need to pay twice.

Chapter 20 | Investment Myths

Fees
Related to the best execution fallacy is the myth that the manager can’t use 
a dedicated institutional broker for technical reasons. Occasionally it is true 
that the broker you picked can’t trade with the manager, in which case you 
simply find one that can. If the manager needs to buy research, they should 
spend their own money—that is what their fee is for.
All fees are negotiable. Back in the ‘70s and ‘80s, long-only managers routinely 
asked for and got 1.25% and 1.5%. Now they get less than 1%. The same thing 
is happening to hedge funds—fees are coming down. “2&20” for a 5% return 
is ridiculous. At private equity firms, no longer it is it required to pay on com-
mitted but un-called capital. Many are now charging only on the called capital. 
Negotiate.
Return equals risk
One enduring myth is the one that says an increasing return requires an 
increase in risk. Or, said another way, if you see high returns, the manager must 
have taken too much risk. This, we suspect, comes from the graphic descrip-
tion of the capital pricing line and an expectation that increased return always 
mean more standard deviations, and that more deviations necessarily means 
more risk. Theoretically, from that 80,000 foot ivory tower, it may look so, but 
to those who actually manage a foundation’s portfolio, it is empirically wrong. 
Risk is simply not standard deviation, and even if you invest as though it is, you 
can see that factually; not all high performing portfolios have higher standard 
deviations. High-performing portfolios actually can reduce risk by building 
a cushion over the required levels of return. This is a marathon—you are  
investing for the long term.
Good managers create returns; returns are not created by deviations and 
volatility. Good managers may be concentrated around a high return number 
with a long tail (skewed), giving a computed high standard deviation, but still 
with little chance of underperforming your required return. Risky, no; volatile, 
maybe. Checks are written in dollars, not deviations—standard or otherwise.

Lies, damn lies and statistics
—Samuel Clemens
The selection of a definition for risk and a goal for return is the core of the 
investment policy in a governance document. These ideas impact and ulti-
mately control the process and methods for investing and establish success 
or failure. While it is certainly unkind to note, it is also true; if MPT and CAPM 
really worked for day-to-day investing, then Bill Sharpe (Nobel laureate and 
originator of CAPM) would be the richest investor, not Warren Buffet, who 
uses neither.
The key to using and understanding statistics is to know their construction 
and their underlying assumptions. The assumptions that are built into the sta-
tistic are the driver for their results and to the evaluation that you are trying 
to make.
Standard Deviation
In most endeavors of experimentation where statistics are used, the ability 
to find the “one number” or “one answer” is paramount. You want to know 
how much snow falls in January, or how many votes X will get, or what the 
return will be from a certain asset class or manager. When you forecast this 
single-point answer (expected result), you are concerned with how far off 
that guess will be—plus or minus—as a tool to describe how “good” the 
single-point expected result is. The bigger the plus or minus, the more uncer-
tainty there is in using the estimate in planning or production. For forecast-
ing industrial planning, medical research and much more, this is a good and 
appropriate measure of success. Missing the forecast by being higher than r 
the real number is just as bad as being off under it. But, when investing, you 
21

are in a different world. Boards just don’t (and shouldn’t) care how accurate 
that single-point (expected return) forecast is; they care about making the 
budget—the ­minimum return needed, anything over that is gravy.
I can’t say that you should be uninterested in the expected return (mean) or 
even the median, but they have little to do with decisions. What is of concern 
is the probability of meeting your required return, and because of that, stan-
dard deviation fails as a meaningful measure. Standard deviation is technically 
the square root of variation, and is used as a standard measure of volatility. 
It sums the square of differences between the average and each observation, 
divided by the number of observations, and then takes the root. This works 
well if the distribution you are evaluating is normal (symmetrical around the 
mean, coincident mean, median and mode, and not peaked or flat) and can 
work to some extent if the distribution is at least symmetrical around the 
mean. The more a manager’s distribution of returns is skewed or peaked, the 
less usable standard deviation becomes. It is just those types of managers you 
should be finding. Standard deviation is often paired with an average return, 
and that average return is the arithmetic return, not compound.
Investment literature assumes that all return distributions are normal in shape, 
and so it follows that down “volatility” is the same as up “volatility,” except 
not all asset classes or managers have normally shaped distributions, and so 
down and up probabilities are not the same. In fact, the more non-normal the 
distribution, the less standard deviation works, which is why consultants need 
to assume the normal distribution when discussing what they do. The overuse 
of standard deviation and other mean-variance statistics meant for different 
uses causes problems because they are just too inaccurate.
Return is a word often used without care for the underlying assumptions and 
the several underlying flavors of meaning. Even partners at Goldman Sachs 
don’t always know which return they are using or misusing.
Returns
You would think that this would be the easiest of the statistics to determine; 
just divide the growth by the beginning, and voilà: the percentage. If only it 
were that easy. In fact, this is one of the most difficult and contentious of 
areas. Not because of the math—that's simple—but because of the meaning 
and interpretation of the results. The biggest complication is the moving of 
money into and out of the portfolio. The board must decide what it is they 
want to know or compare in order to decide which of several mathematical 
calculations to use.

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
113
Average Return
This is the arithmetical average of a series of returns over time (usually annu-
ally). To calculate, add each year and divide by the number of years. This is the 
return used in mean variance statistics. The average return is different than the 
compound rate of return. Care is needed to determine if the sales guy pitch-
ing a certain investment is using average (mean) or annualized (coumpound), or 
using both words to mean the same thing. Average is often (but not always) 
higher than annualized.
Compound (Annualized) Return
When boards (and individuals) talk about returns, this is the one they most 
often mean. It is the rate of return, which, if compounded over a period of 
time, would yield the actual gain or loss achieved in the portfolio during that 
period. It answers the question: “If we started with X amount of money and so 
many years (or months) later, after adding and spending along the way, we have 
Y, what average annual (annualized) return did we have along the way to equal 
that final number?” The various actual returns each year compound the actual 
dollars, so each year can’t just be added and averaged; they must be annualized. 
Compounding is the underlying assumption that must be taken into consid-
eration, and it is most definitely not the calculation used in measuring mean 
variance statistics for the portfolio.
Example: In the first year, the return is minus 50%, the second year’s is plus 50%, 
and the third year’s is plus 50%. A simple average of the years’ returns is the sum 
of the three years: 50 divided by 3 equals 16.7%. But if we find the value of the 
fund stating at $1,000 we can follow: $1,000 less 50% is $500, $500 plus 50% 
is $750, $750 plus 50% is $1,125. $125 is not a sixth of $1,000, so what gives? 
The real average compound return, or “annualized return,” is 4%. You can check the 
work simply. $1,000 plus 4% is $1,040, then $1,040 plus 4% is $1,081.60, then 
$1,081.60 plus 4% is $1,124.86.
The question to ask is: Which do you want, the average of each year or the 
return required to get from here to there (or its converse—the return you 
received to get from there to here)? 
Cumulative Return
The cumulative return is simply the aggregate amount that an investment or 
portfolio has gained or lost over time—in other words, the growth of each 
dollar or of the total fund. In the example above, it is $125, or 12.5%. Mutual 
funds commonly use a mountain chart, which in the above example would 
start at $1,000 and end at $1,125, showing a dip (the negative first year), then 
a steep ramp-up (the positive next two).

Chapter 21 | Useful Statistics
114
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
IRR is the rate of return that would make the present value of future cash 
flows plus the final market value of an investment equal the amount the fund 
initially invested. With multiple draws on the committed investment, modified 
IRR is generally used. Although a popular choice for analyzing venture capital 
and private equity investments, it has several limitations and may not give the 
answer to your real question.
The absolute number of the IRR can be misleading. In instances where one 
investment has a higher initial drawdown of the investment than a second mutu-
ally exclusive project, the first project may have a lower IRR, but a higher increase 
in the fund’s wealth, and should thus be preferred over the second investment.
IRR assumes reinvestment of interim cash flows at rates of return equal to 
the IRR. Therefore, the IRR will overstate the annual equivalent rate of return 
for a project whose interim cash flows are reinvested at a rate lower than 
the calculated IRR. This presents a problem for funds, since there is frequently 
not another project available in the interim that can earn the same rate of 
return as the first project, especially if the IRR is high. This is especially true 
for private equity funds that have quick exits, which calculate a high IRR over a 
short time. The high number is carried forward for the rest of the investment’s 
life. When the calculated IRR is higher than the true reinvestment rate for 
interim cash flows, the measure will overestimate—sometimes significantly—
the annual equivalent return from the investment.
As an investment comparison or decision tool, IRR should not be used to rate 
mutually exclusive projects, but only to decide whether a single ­investment is 
worth investing in. 
Time-Weighted Return
If money is invested and then left alone, the calculation is that simple “­difference 
divided by beginning value,” but what about the real world, where money 
is invested and pulled out to be used for programs or budgets, then more 
is added and distributed on an uneven time frames? How does the board 
compare to peers or other funds when they all have differing cash flows? 
The time-weighted return calculation method was originally developed to 
measure the performance of a portfolio or fund manager, and sprung from 
a need for industry consistency in reporting returns that are independent of 
a clients’ or individual investors’ actions. Time-weighted rate of return mea-
sures how much your investments returned on average, without the influence 
of the size or timing of contributions. You can think of time-weighted return 
as the return on your portfolio, assuming $1 invested at the beginning and 
ignoring cash flows in and out. This method is used to compare investment 
choices or strategies vs. appropriate benchmarks. This method was designed 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
115
to ­isolate the manager’s specific performance from the fund’s timing and size 
of contributions or withdrawals to the fund. Since investment managers usu-
ally have no control over client cash flow decisions, time-weighted return is 
the only fair way to evaluate managers versus their benchmarks. Furthermore, 
time-weighted return depends only on the length of time a contribution or 
withdrawal has been in or out of the portfolio and not on the size of the 
investment—hence the term “time-weighted.”
An example works well here. In a single period, let’s try a month, the fund 
starts with $1,000, then by the 15th of the month the value is $1,050. So you 
take the $50 out on the 15th to make a grant and have no growth over the 
balance of the month, leaving $1,000 at the end of the month. So what was the 
actual return of the portfolio or manager? If you had not taken the $50 out, a 
gain of $50 would have been a cumulative return of 5% for the month. For half 
of the month, if the cumulative value was up to $1,050 or 5%, which would be 
a 10% internal rate of return and a cumulative return of 10% if the rate contin-
ues for the rest of the month. It did not. To calculate a time-weighted return, 
half the month at 10% (monthly rate) plus half the month at zero, divided  
by 2, is 5% for the month, which is the value had you left the money in the fund 
for the entire month.
This is the number that is published by money managers and mutual funds 
and is the number used to compare performance, the one that “does not 
guarantee future success.” When applied to the entire fund, it is the number 
that the board can use to measure against a rival, a peer, or the universe of 
other funds.
Money-Weighted Return (Dollar-Weighted 
Return)
A dollar-weighted rate of return is highly influenced by the timing and size of 
cash flows into and out of the account, as well as the investment performance 
of the fund(s) chosen by the investor. This means your return is more heav-
ily impacted when more money is actually invested, hence the term “dollar-
weighted.” In this case, investors are rewarded more for larger investments 
made during periods of greater price appreciation (of the fund). This method 
is more investor-centric because it does not isolate the funds’ performance 
from an investor’s luck or timing. Dollar-weighted return is the same as IRR.
When evaluating a manager’s performance, one uses the time-weighted mea-
sure, since the manager can’t control the timing of cash flows. Time weighting 
accurately tells you how well the manager has done and is the number you can 
compare to peers and benchmarks. Dollar weighting tells you how well you 
have done, including cash flows, whether or not you were timing the flows. It 
is not a number that can be compared to any other fund or benchmark.

Chapter 21 | Useful Statistics
116
Alpha
Is a measurement of performance relative to a benchmark index. Any excess 
return of a portfolio relative to the return of the benchmark is the fund’s 
Alpha, the idea being that the index is the average or target for that part of 
the market. The higher the Alpha, the better, as it represents the investment 
manager’s ability to add value to the fund’s return. One of the two differ-
ent calculations will adjust a portfolio’s return for volatility before calculating 
Alpha, and the other does not. Which to use depends a great deal on your 
view of volatility. Alpha is also shorthand for “value added.”
Beta
Is a measure of the volatility of a portfolio in comparison to the market as 
a whole. This statistic is calculated using a regression analysis to determine 
the tendency of a portfolio’s return to respond to swings in the market. The 
market Beta is always one, so if your portfolio has a Beta that is greater than 
one, it may be more volatile than the market. The opposite is true when your 
portfolio’s Beta is less than one, in which case the Beta on your portfolio is 
dynamic and will change over time. Beta is also shorthand for “the market.” 
Up-Market Capture
This measures how your portfolio has performed during periods when the 
market is rising. The ratio is calculated by dividing the portfolio’s returns by 
the returns of the index during the up-markets and multiplying that factor 
by 100. A ratio of greater than 100 indicates the portfolio outperformed the 
market during periods of rise, while a ratio of less than 100 indicates that it 
went up less than the market in those periods of rise. A portfolio with an up-
market capture ratio of 130 indicates the portfolio outperformed the market 
by 30% over that time. Note that this includes all up-market periods in a given 
time horizon, and they need not be consecutive.
Down-Market Capture
This measures how your portfolio has performed during periods of mar-
ket decline. The ratio is calculated by dividing the portfolio’s returns by the 
returns of the index during the down-market and then multiplying that factor 
by 100. A ratio of less than 100 indicates that the portfolio outperformed 
the market (fell less) during that market decline, while a ratio of greater than 
100 indicates that it fell more during those down periods. A portfolio with a 

Winning the Institutional Investing Race
117
down-market capture ratio of 70 indicates the portfolio was down 30% less 
than the market. Note that this includes all down-market periods in a given 
time horizon, and they need not be consecutive.
Sharpe Ratio
This statistic measures performance by subtracting the risk-free rate from the 
rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation 
of the portfolio’s returns. A Sharpe ratio greater than one suggests the port-
folio had more return per unit of volatility than would be expected. Users of 
this ratio also suggest that it indicates Alpha.
R-Squared
R-squared is a statistical measurement that represents the percentage of a 
fund that can be explained by movements in some benchmark. It is also called 
the coefficient of determination. R-squared values range from 0 to 100. The 
higher the R-squared (100 being the highest) the better the benchmark fits a 
portfolio and that the more movements of the fund are completely explained 
by movements in the index. An R-squared between 85 and 100 indicates the 
investment is more index-like, and one with a reading of 70 or less means the 
fund doesn't behave much like the index.
Tracking Error
This statistic represents how closely a portfolio follows the index to which it 
is benchmarked. An actively managed portfolio will likely have a higher track-
ing error, while an index ETF (which is deliberately constructed to mimic 
the index) would have a low tracking error. If you really want low tracking 
error, use an index fund, but there is no real reason to be concerned with it. 
Outstanding managers providing the skewed and highly mean-shifted returns 
you need to find will most often have high tracking error because they are 
doing so much better than the index benchmark.
Information Ratio
This ratio measures a portfolio’s return above the benchmark to the volatility 
of those returns. The information ratio is similar to the Sharpe ratio, the only 
differences being the Sharpe ratio uses the risk-free rate instead of the bench-
mark, and the Sharpe ratio uses standard deviation as a measure of volatility, 
while the information ratio uses the manager’s tracking error.

Chapter 21 | Useful Statistics
118
A manager’s information ratio is highly dependent on the tracking error. If two 
managers have the same information ratio and one lowers his tracking error 
by one, say from 5 to 4, the other manager would have to increase his return 
by much more, say from 10 to 12.5, to keep the same information ratio. A 
great name for a statistic, but to what purpose? So what does an information 
ratio that is equal between these two tell you? One tracks the benchmark 
closer so it can return less (significantly less) than one that has a higher track-
ing number? The information ratio and the tracking error are loved by the 
consultants, but just obfuscate the information you really need.
Volume-Weighted Average Price
This is the average price of a stock during the day, weighted by volume. The 
more shares traded at a high price, the higher the VWAP, and the more traded 
at a lower price, the lower the VWAP. VWAP is calculated by adding up the 
amount traded for every transaction (price multiplied by number of shares 
traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded for the day.
VWAP is a benchmark used to tell how well your manager is trading, adding 
or subtracting value over time. If your manager is consistently buying above 
VWAP and selling below VWAP, they are not making good trades, and you 
need to have a strenuous conversation. If buying below and selling above, they 
deserve, at the very least, a pat on the back.
One last thought on statistics
As lawyers, doctors, academics, or other professionals in today’s information 
age, we have grown accustomed to statistical analysis and the significance 
placed on these analytics. For example, in the field of medicine we are told, 
with bold headlines and a breathless sense of urgency, that a particular food, 
activity or medicine will double our chances of some dire result, but then find 
the statistical difference in probability is in fact double, but from .0000000002 
to .0000000004. True, but does anyone care? Is it significant to our lives?
In the field of investments, and more specifically the investment of endowment 
and foundation funds, boards and investment committees have come to place 
an unwarranted faith in these statistical significances rather than in their eco-
nomic significance to the fund. Boards are told that, for example, for a particu-
lar statistic, one investment is 10% or even 20% better than another. Certainly 
a significant difference in the statistic, but what impact does it have on the fund? 
Has risk changed? How much more return will the fund get? Is the fund being 
paid to take that risk? Does it matter at all? Unfortunately, statistical difference 
does not speak to substantive issues. Over-reliance on statistics is often a mis-
placed hope for a mechanical solution to non-mechanical problems.

This is often seen in the pitch for hedge funds by consultants, especially those 
employed by the big banks, who are selling their “platform” managers. They 
tout the advantages of some long - short fund, or a market-neutral fund that 
cuts the volatility in half or more. The foundation gets a manager earning 5% 
net after paying 2 and 20, which means the investment actually earned closer 
to 8%, and somehow the reduced volatility makes it all worthwhile. If the 
required return was 8%, it seems like a bad trade. Then there are all of the 
structured techniques with names like “portable Alpha,” and “liability directed 
investment” that are designed simply to add leverage to the fund (and fees to 
the seller). Leverage may reduce volatility, but it never reduces risk.

For Joan Bricher, the most demanding and hardest 
working CFO we have ever met (but the easiest to get 
along with), and Fred Kavli, a crusty and fractious 
Chairman who trusted us and listened.

Acknowledgments
We owe a debt to the many directors and trustees that we have worked with 
over the years. We learned much from errors and successes, both ours and 
theirs, and hope to pass along some of that experience. 
The attitudes and approaches to investment and governance by people like 
Dr. Nick Vincent, Paul Brown, Al Feldman, and Fred Gluck are something to 
be admired and emulated.

Preface
A number of years ago the Scholarship, Research and Education Foundation 
established by TEXPERS (Texas Public Employees Retirement System 
Association) asked me to set up a training and certification program for public 
retirement fund trustees and executives. They saw that one of the problems 
shared by these public employees (and even foundation board members) is 
that they seldom have any training or backgrounds in managing an investment 
fund. This is not an indictment, just a fact: after a career as a fireman, cop, 
CFO, doctor, or lawyer, people are selected to become a member of a board 
and then to the investment committee. What to do? How to do it? 
Most, especially those not familiar with the function of an investment 
committee will simply keep the status quo or try to mimic what other 
committees are doing. After 30 years of work with many different boards, I 
have seen much of what works and what does not. Following your neighbor 
is not always the best way to go, and sometimes it is the worst. This book 
was written for board members without a background in investments and 
for those investment professionals who are experienced in a narrow area. 
Managing an entire fund representing all of an institution’s assets is different 
than having a deep understanding of real estate, bonds or private equity; it 
is not even close to the same as managing one’s own 401k, nor is it anything 
like managing financial audits or a bank. 
The men and women who took the SRE course were highly motivated. They 
needed to be, because this was no party conference; they worked and studied 
hard and, most importantly, paid in hard dollars. For the first several years 
it was established at Baylor University, then moved to George Washington 
University. The course was a full week of long, intense days (and evenings) of 
class and practical exercises culminating in a five-hour exam for certification. 
A serial three-part course was also offered to small Texas firefighter funds 
with an exam after each section. Nearly 500 people were certified of the 
almost 600 or so who took the course. This book is not a recreation of 
that course, but intends to do much the same—provide a background and 
framework for investing an institution’s assets, with a focus on foundations 
and endowments.

Preface 
xiv
You will find several points of view and themes that underlie the entire book. 
The first is that these funds exist for a reason. They have a purpose. Money 
was given or contributed for that purpose and it is fulfilling that purpose that 
is, or should be, the goal of the investment committee. No other purpose, not 
peer competition, not indexes, not what others may say, not the concern for 
self (reputation or getting re-elected). No other goal but the defined purpose 
of the fund should be key. You are a fiduciary. Yes, we know that “others” are 
trying to influence where, how, and with whom the money gets invested; any 
large pool of money draws these people like flies to a picnic. We also know 
that many committee members are concerned with what they get or what 
the risk to their reputations may be, but that does not make it right, or what 
a fiduciary should do. 
The second point is our abhorrence of the words “that’s the way it has always 
been” and its cousin “that’s what everyone else does.” These Procrustean 
ideas get expressed in many ways and almost always demonstrate a lack 
of effort, thought, and understanding by fiduciaries. But most importantly, 
they demonstrate a lack of interest. Rationalization is easy, especially when 
throwing around the word “fiduciary,” but doing what someone else does 
just because they do, or hiring based on “marquee” or name brand is not 
being loyal to the organization, and loyalty is very much a part of being a 
fiduciary. This is not to say that everything done in the past is wrong, or that 
everything done by “everybody else” is wrong, either. Much is right and some 
even good. It is the lack of a critical eye, the lack of questioning, the lack of 
divergent views and the lemming-like following of the pack that leads to a 
failure that we think is avoidable.
This book is in two main parts: Governance, which sets the rules, and 
Investment, which executes within those rules.
