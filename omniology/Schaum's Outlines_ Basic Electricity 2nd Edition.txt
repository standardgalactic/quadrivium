Chapter 1
The Nature of Electricity
STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM
Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Matter is composed of very small particles called
atoms. All matter can be classiﬁed into either one of two groups: elements or compounds. In an element, all the
atoms are the same. Examples of elements are aluminum, copper, carbon, germanium, and silicon. A compound
is a combination of elements. Water, for example, is a compound consisting of the elements hydrogen and
oxygen. The smallest particle of any compound that retains the original characteristics of that compound is
called a molecule.
Atoms are composed of subatomic particles of electrons, protons, and neutrons in various combinations.
The electron is the fundamental negative (−) charge of electricity. Electrons revolve about the nucleus or
center of the atom in paths of concentric “shells,” or orbits (Fig. 1-1). The proton is the fundamental positive
(+) charge of electricity. Protons are found in the nucleus. The number of protons within the nucleus of any
particular atom speciﬁes the atomic number of that atom. For example, the silicon atom has 14 protons in
its nucleus so the atomic number of silicon is 14. The neutron, which is the fundamental neutral charge of
electricity, is also found in the nucleus.
Fig. 1-1
Electrons and nucleus of an atom
Atoms of different elements differ from one another in the number of electrons and protons they contain
(Fig. 1-2). In its natural state, an atom of any element contains an equal number of electrons and protons. Since
the negative (−) charge of each electron is equal in magnitude to the positive (+) charge of each proton, the
two opposite charges cancel. An atom in this condition is electrically neutral, or in balance (Fig. 1-2).
Example 1.1
Describe the two simplest atoms.
The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom, which contains 1 proton in its nucleus balanced by 1 electron orbiting the
nucleus (Fig. 1-2a). The next simplest atom is helium, which has 2 protons in its nucleus balanced by 2 electrons orbiting
the nucleus (Fig. 1-2b).
A stable (neutral) atom has a certain amount of energy, which is equal to the sum of the energies of its
electrons. Electrons, in turn, have different energies called energy levels. The energy level of an electron is
proportional to its distance from the nucleus. Therefore, the energy levels of electrons in shells farther from
the nucleus are higher than those of electrons in shells nearer the nucleus. The electrons in the outermost shell
are called valence electrons. When external energy such as heat, light, or electric energy is applied to certain
1

THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY
[CHAP. 1
Fig. 1-2
Atomic structure of four common elements
materials, the electrons gain energy. This may cause the electrons to move to a higher energy level. An atom
in which this has occurred is said to be in an excited state. An atom in an excited state is unstable.
When an electron has moved to the outermost shell of its atom, it is least attracted by the positive charges
of the protons within the nucleus of its atom. If enough energy is then applied to the atom, some of the
outermost shell or valence electrons will leave the atom. These electrons are called free electrons. It is the
movement of free electrons that provides electric current in a metal conductor.
Each shell of an atom can contain only a certain maximum number of electrons. This number is called the
quota of a shell. The orbiting electrons are in successive shells designated K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q at increasing
distances outward from the nucleus. Each shell has a maximum number of electrons for stability (Fig. 1-3).
After the K shell has been ﬁlled with 2 electrons, the L shell can take up to 8 electrons. The maximum number

 
CHAP. 1]
THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY

Fig. 1-3
Energy shells and the quota of electrons for each
shell
of electrons in the remaining shells can be 8, 18, or 32 for different elements. The maximum for an outermost
shell, though, is always 8.
Example 1.2
Structure the copper atom by identifying its energy shells (Fig. 1-2d).
In the copper atom there are 29 protons in the nucleus balanced by 29 orbiting electrons. The 29 electrons ﬁll the K
shell with 2 electrons and the L shell with 8 electrons. The remaining 19 electrons then ﬁll the M shell with 18 electrons,
and the net result is 1 electron in the outermost N shell.
If the quota is ﬁlled in the outermost shell of an atom, an element made up of such atoms is said to be
inert. When the K shell is ﬁlled with 2 electrons, we have the inert gas helium (Fig. 1-2b). When the outer
shell of an atom lacks its quota of electrons, it is capable of gaining or losing electrons. If an atom loses one
or more electrons in its outer shell, the protons outnumber the electrons so that the atom carries a net positive
electric charge. In this condition, the atom is called a positive ion. If an atom gains electrons, its net electric
charge becomes negative. The atom then is called a negative ion. The process by which atoms either gain or
lose electrons is called ionization.
Example 1.3
Describe what happens to the copper atom when it loses an electron from its outermost shell.
The copper atom becomes a positive ion with a net charge of +1.
THE ELECTRIC CHARGE
Since some atoms can lose electrons and other atoms can gain electrons, it is possible to cause a transfer of
electrons from one object to another. When this takes place, the equal distribution of the positive and negative
charges in each object no longer exists. Therefore, one object will contain an excess number of electrons and
its charge must have a negative, or minus (−), electric polarity. The other object will contain an excess number
of protons and its charge must have a positive, or plus (+), polarity.
When a pair of objects contains the same charge, that is, both positive (+) or both negative (−), the
objects are said to have like charges. When a pair of bodies contains different charges, that is, one body is
positive (+) while the other body is negative (−), they are said to have unlike or opposite charges. The law of
electric charges may be stated as follows:
Like charges repel each other; unlike charges attract each other.

 
4
THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY
[CHAP. 1
If a negative (−) charge is placed next to another negative (−) charge, the charges will repel each other
(Fig. 1-4a). If a positive (+) charge is placed next to a negative (−) charge, they will be drawn together
(Fig. 1-4c).
Fig. 1-4
Force between charges
THE COULOMB
The magnitude of electric charge a body possesses is determined by the number of electrons compared with
the number of protons within the body. The symbol for the magnitude of the electric charge is Q, expressed in
units of coulombs (C). A charge of one negative coulomb, −Q, means a body contains a charge of 6.25×1018
more electrons than protons.∗
Example 1.4
What is the meaning of +Q?
A charge of one positive coulomb means a body contains a charge of 6.25 × 1018 more protons than electrons.
Example 1.5
A dielectric material has a negative charge of 12.5 × 1018 electrons. What is its charge in coulombs?
Since the number of electrons is double the charge of 1 C (1 C = 6.25 × 1018 electrons), −Q = 2 C.
THE ELECTROSTATIC FIELD
The fundamental characteristic of an electric charge is its ability to exert a force. This force is present
within the electrostatic ﬁeld surrounding every charged object. When two objects of opposite polarity are
brought near each other, the electrostatic ﬁeld is concentrated in the area between them (Fig. 1-5). The electric
Fig. 1-5

CHAP. 1]
THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY

ﬁeld is indicated by lines of force drawn between the two objects. If an electron is released at point A in this
ﬁeld, it will be repelled by the negative charge and will be attracted to the positive one. Thus both charges
will tend to move the electron in the direction of the lines of force between the two objects. The arrowheads
in Fig. 1-5 indicate the direction of motion that would be taken by the electron if it were in different areas of
the electrostatic ﬁeld.
Example 1.6
Draw the electrostatic ﬁeld that would exist between two negatively charged objects.
When two like charges are placed near each other, the lines of force repel each other as shown below.
A charged object will retain its charge temporarily if there is no immediate transfer of electrons to or from
it. In this condition, the charge is said to be at rest. Electricity at rest is called static electricity.
POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE
Due to the force of its electrostatic ﬁeld, an electric charge has the ability to do the work of moving another
charge by attraction or repulsion. The ability of a charge to do work is called its potential. When one charge
is different from the other, there must be a difference in potential between them.
The sum of the differences of potential of all the charges in the electrostatic ﬁeld is referred to as
electromotive force (emf).
The basic unit of potential difference is the volt (V). The symbol for potential difference is V , indicating
the ability to do the work of forcing electrons to move. Because the volt unit is used, potential difference is
called voltage.
Example 1.7
What is the meaning of a battery voltage output of 6 V?
A voltage output of 6 V means that the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery is 6 V. Thus,
voltage is fundamentally the potential difference between two points.
CURRENT
The movement or the ﬂow of electrons is called current. To produce current, the electrons must be moved
by a potential difference. Current is represented by the letter symbol I. The basic unit in which current is
measured is the ampere (A). One ampere of current is deﬁned as the movement of one coulomb past any point
of a conductor during one second of time. Electricity can be termed as electric current.
Example 1.8
If a current of 2 A ﬂows through a meter for 1 minute (min), how many coulombs pass through the meter?
1 A is 1 C per second (C/s). 2 A is 2 C/s. Since there are 60 s in 1 min, 60 × 2 C = 120 C pass through the meter in
1 min.
The deﬁnition of current can be expressed as an equation:
I = Q
T

(1-2)
Charge differs from current in that Q is an accumulation of charge, while I measures the intensity of
moving charges.
Example 1.9
Find the answer to Example 1.8 by using Eq. (1-2).
Write down the known values:
I = 2 A
T = 60 s
Write down the unknown:
Q = ?
Use Eq. (1-2) to solve the unknown:
Q = I × T
Substitute I = 2 A and T = 60 s:
Q = (2 A) × (60 s)
Solve for Q:
Q = 120 C
Ans.
CURRENT FLOW
In a conductor, such as copper wire, the free electrons are charges that can be forced to move with relative
ease by a potential difference. If a potential difference is connected across two ends of a copper wire (Fig. 1-6),
Fig. 1-6

current

 
CHAP. 1]

the applied voltage (1.5 V) forces the free electrons to move. This current is a drift of electrons from the point
of negative charge, −Q, at one end of the wire, moving through the wire, and returning to the positive charge,
+Q, at the other end. The direction of the electron drift is from the negative side of the battery, through the
wire, and back to the positive side of the battery. The direction of electron ﬂow is from a point of negative
potential to a point of positive potential. The solid arrow (Fig. 1-6) indicates the direction of current in terms
of electron ﬂow. The direction of moving positive charges, opposite from electron ﬂow, is considered the
conventional ﬂow of current and is indicated by the dashed arrow (Fig. 1-6). In basic electricity, circuits are
usually analyzed in terms of conventional current because a positive potential is considered before a negative
potential. Therefore, the direction of conventional current is the direction of positive charges in motion. Any
circuit can be analyzed by either electron ﬂow or conventional ﬂow in the opposite direction. In this book,
current is always considered as conventional ﬂow.
SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY
Chemical Battery
A voltaic chemical cell is a combination of materials which are used for converting chemical energy into
electric energy. A battery is formed when two or more cells are connected. A chemical reaction produces
opposite charges on two dissimilar metals, which serve as the negative and positive terminals (Fig. 1-7). The
metals are in contact with an electrolyte.
Fig. 1-7
Voltaic chemical cell
Generator
The generator is a machine in which electromagnetic inductance is used to produce a voltage by rotating
coils of wire through a stationary magnetic ﬁeld or by rotating a magnetic ﬁeld through stationary coils of
wire. Today, more than 95 percent of the world’s energy is produced by generators.
Thermal Energy
The production of most electric energy begins with the formation of heat energy. Coal, oil, or natural
gas can be burned to release large quantities of heat. Once heat energy is available, conversion to mechanical
energy is the next step. Water is heated to produce steam, which is then used to turn the turbines that drive the
electric generators. A direct conversion from heat energy to electric energy will increase efﬁciency and reduce
thermal pollution of water resources and the atmosphere.
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Conversion
In an MHD converter, gases are ionized by very high temperatures, approximately 3000 degrees Fahrenheit
(3000◦F), or 1650 degrees Celsius (1650◦C). The hot gases pass through a strong magnetic ﬁeld with current
resulting. The exhausted gases are then moved back to the heat source to form a complete cycle (Fig. 1-8).
MHD converters have no mechanical moving parts.

Principles of MHD converter
Thermionic Emission
The thermionic energy converter is a device that consists of two electrodes in a vacuum. The emitter elec-
trode is heated and produces free electrons. The collector electrode is maintained at a much lower temperature
and receives the electrons released at the emitter.
Solar Cells
Solar cells convert light energy directly into electric energy. They consist of semiconductor material like
silicon and are used in large arrays in spacecraft to recharge batteries. Solar cells are also used in home heating.
Piezoelectric Effect
Certain crystals, such as quartz and Rochelle salts, generate a voltage when they are vibrated mechanically.
This action is known as the piezoelectric effect. One example is the crystal phonograph cartridge, which contains
a Rochelle salt crystal to which a needle is fastened. As the needle moves in the grooves of a record, it swings
from side to side. This mechanical motion is applied to the crystal, and a voltage is then generated.
Photoelectric Effect
Some materials, such as zinc, potassium, and cesium oxide, emit electrons when light strikes their surfaces.
This action is known as the photoelectric effect. Common applications of photoelectricity are television camera
tubes and photoelectric cells.
Thermocouples
If wires of two different metals, such as iron and copper, are welded together and the joint is heated, the
difference in electron activity in the two metals produces an emf across the joint. Thermocouple junctions can
be used to measure the amount of current because current acts to heat the junction.
DIRECT AND ALTERNATING CURRENTS AND VOLTAGES
Direct current (dc) is the current that moves through a conductor or circuit in one direction only (Fig. 1-9a).
The reason for the unidirectional current is that voltage sources such as cells and batteries maintain the same

 
CHAP. 1]
THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY

Fig. 1-9
Waveforms of a constant dc current and dc voltage
polarity of output voltage (Fig. 1-9b). The voltage supplied by these sources is called direct-current voltage,
or simply dc voltage. A dc voltage source can change the amount of its output voltage, but if the same polarity
is maintained, direct current will ﬂow in one direction only.
Example 1.10
Assuming the polarity of the battery were reversed in Fig. 1-9b, draw the new curves of current and
voltage.
With polarity reversed, the current will now ﬂow in the opposite direction. The curves would then appear as follows:
An alternating-current voltage (ac voltage) source periodically reverses or alternates in polarity
(Fig. 1-10a). Therefore, the resulting alternating current also periodically reverses direction (Fig. 1-10b).
In terms of conventional ﬂow, the current ﬂows from the positive terminal of the voltage source, through the
circuit, and back to the negative terminal, but when the generator alternates in polarity, the current must reverse
its direction. The ac power line used in most homes is a common example. The voltage and current direction
go through many reversals each second in these systems.

In observing the maximum number of electrons in shells K, L, M, and N in Fig. 1-3, you will ﬁnd that
they are 2, 8, 18, and 32 electrons, respectively. Develop a formula that describes this relationship,
where n is the shell number in sequential order outward from the nucleus.
The formula is 2n2 because the maximum number of electrons in the
K or ﬁrst shell (n = 1) is 2(l2) = 2(1) = 2
L or second shell (n = 2) is 2(22) = 2(4) = 8
M or third shell (n = 3) is 2(32) = 2(9) = 18
N or fourth shell (n = 4) is 2(42) = 2(16) = 32
This relationship is true for most elements.

What is the net charge of a body that contains 8 protons and 4 electrons?
The numerical value of the net charge is found by subtracting the number of one type of charge
from the number of the other type. So a positive charge of 8 (+8) and a negative charge of 4 (−4)
yields a positive charge of 4 (+4).
1.5
A charged insulator has deﬁciency of 50 × 1018 electrons. Find its charge in coulombs with polarity.
Since 1 C = 6.25 × 1018 electrons, 8 C = 50 × 1018 electrons. Deﬁciency of electrons means an
excess of protons. So the insulator has a positive charge of 8 C, or +Q = 8 C.

Units
INTRODUCTION
The international metric system of units of dimensions, commonly called SI, is used in electricity. The
abbreviation SI stands for système internationale. The seven base units of SI are length, mass, time, electric
current, thermodynamic temperature, light intensity, and amount of substance (Table 2-1). Formerly the MKS
metric system was used, where M stands for meter (length), K for kilogram (mass), and S for seconds (time).
The two supplementary units of SI are plane angle and solid angle (Table 2-2).

Other common units can be derived from the base and supplementary units. For example, the unit of
charge is the coulomb, which is derived from the base units of second and ampere. Most of the units that are
used in electricity are derived ones (Table 2-3).
METRIC PREFIXES
In the study of basic electricity, some electrical units are too small or too large to express conveniently. For
example, in the case of resistance, we often use values in thousands or millions of ohms (). The preﬁx kilo
(denoted by the letter k) is a convenient way of expressing a thousand. Thus, instead of saying a resistor has a
value of 10 000 , we normally refer to it as a 10-kilohm (10-k) resistor. In the case of current, we often use
15

 
16
ELECTRICAL STANDARDS AND CONVENTIONS
[CHAP. 2
values in thousandths or millionths of an ampere. We use expressions such as milliamperes and microamperes.
The preﬁx milli is a short way of saying a thousandth and micro is a short way of saying a millionth. Thus
0.012 A becomes 12 milliamperes (mA) and 0.000 005 A becomes 5 microamperes (µA). Table 2-4 lists the
metric preﬁxes commonly used in electricity and their numerical equivalents.

Example 2.1
A resistor has a value of 10 M stamped on its case. How many ohms of resistance does this resistor have?
The letter M denotes mega, or million. Thus the resistor has a value of 10 megohms (M) or 10 million ohms.
Example 2.2
A power station has a capacity of delivering 500 000 watts (W). What is the capacity in kilowatts (kW)?
Refer to Table 2-4. Kilo stands for 1000. Thus, 500 000 W = 500 kW.
POWERS OF 10
We have seen that it is often necessary or desirable to convert one unit of measurement to another unit
that may be larger or smaller. In the previous section, we did this by substituting a metric preﬁx for certain
values. Another way would be to convert the number to a power of 10. Powers of 10 are often termed the
“engineer’s shorthand.” Examples of expressing number as powers of 10 are shown in Table 2-5.

ROUNDING OFF NUMBERS
A number is rounded off by dropping one or more digits at its right. If the digit to be dropped is less than 5,
we leave the digit as it is. For example, 4.1632, if rounded to four digits, would be 4.163; if rounded to three
digits, 4.16. If the digit to be dropped is greater than 5, we increase the digit to its left by 1. For example,
7.3468, if rounded to four digits, would be 7.347; if rounded to three digits, 7.35. If the digit to be dropped is
exactly 5 (that is, 5 followed by nothing but zeros), we increase the digit to its left by 1 if it is an odd number
and we leave the digit to the left as it is if it is an even number. For example, 2.175, when rounded to three
digits, becomes 2.18. The number 2.185 would also round to the same value, 2.18, if rounded to three digits.
Any digit that is needed to deﬁne the speciﬁc value is said to be signiﬁcant. For example, a voltage of
115 V has three signiﬁcant digits: 1, 1, and 5. When rounding off numbers, zero is not counted as a signiﬁcant
digit if it appears immediately after the decimal point and is followed by other signiﬁcant digits. Such zeros
must be retained and the count of signiﬁcant digits must begin at the ﬁrst signiﬁcant digit beyond them. For
example, 0.000 12 has two signiﬁcant digits, 1 and 2, and the preceding zeros don’t count. However, 18.0 has
three signiﬁcant digits; in this case zero is signiﬁcant because it is not followed by other signiﬁcant digits.
In electricity, speciﬁc values are usually expressed in three signiﬁcant digits.
Example 2.11
Round off the following numbers to three signiﬁcant digits.
We look at the fourth signiﬁcant digit to the right and observe whether this digit is less than 5, greater than 5, or
equal to 5.
5.6428 = 5.64
0.016 95 = 0.0170
49.67 = 49.7
2078 = 2080
305.42 = 305

Scientiﬁc notation is a convenient way to work problems in electricity. Often, we express a numerical
answer in terms of a preﬁx rather than leave the answer in scientiﬁc notation.

in Fig. 2-1b: the dry cell, the switch, and lamp. Note the positive (+) and the negative (−) markings in
both pictorial and schematic representations of the dry cell. The schematic components represent the pictorial
components in a simpliﬁed manner. A schematic diagram then is one that shows by means of graphic symbols
the electrical connections and the functions of the different parts of a circuit.

A schematic diagram of a two-transistor radio receiver is shown in Fig. 2-3. The circuit diagram in Fig. 2-3
shows the components in the order from left to right in which they are used to convert radio waves into sound
waves. With the use of the diagram, it is then possible to trace the operation of the circuit from the incoming
signal at the antenna to the output at the headphones. The components in a schematic diagram are identiﬁed
by letter symbols such as R for resistors, C for capacitors, L for inductors, and Q for transistors (Table 2-7).
Symbols are further identiﬁed by letter–number combinations such as R1, R2, and R3 (sometimes written as
R1, R2, R3) to prevent confusion when more than one type of component is used (Fig. 2-3). The letters B,
C, and E near the transistor symbols indicate the base, collector, and emitter of the transistors (Fig. 2-3). The
numerical values of components are often indicated directly in the schematic diagram, such as 220 k for R1
and 0.022 µF for C2 (Fig. 2-3). When these values are not given in this way, they are stated in the parts list
or the notes which accompany the diagram.

Schematic diagram of a two-transistor radio
A schematic diagram does not show the physical location of the components or the wires which connect
the components.
ONE-LINE DIAGRAM
A one-line, or single-line, diagram shows the component parts of a circuit by means of single lines and
appropriate graphical symbols. The single lines represent the two or more conductors that are connected
between the components in the actual circuit. The one-line diagram shows the necessary basic information
about the sequence of a circuit but does not give the detailed information that is found in a schematic diagram.
One-line diagrams are generally used to show complex electrical systems without the individual conductors to
the various loads.
Example 2.13
Draw a one-line diagram showing the major equipment, switching devices, and connecting circuits of
an electric power substation.
See Fig. 2-4. The single line running down represents three lines in this three-wire system. The power path can be
traced from the shielded aluminum cable steel reinforced (ACSR) downward past a grounded lightning arrester, through a
disconnect switch, fused disconnect switches, and a step-down transformer. It continues downward through an oil circuit
breaker, disconnect switch, past another lightning arrester, and out through the ACSR line.
BLOCK DIAGRAM
The block diagram is used to show the relationship between the various component groups or stages in
the operation of a circuit. It shows in block form the path of a signal through a circuit from input to output
(Fig. 2-5). The blocks are drawn in the shape of squares or rectangles that are joined by single lines. Arrowheads
placed at the terminal ends of the lines show the direction of the signal path from input to output as the diagram
is read from left to right. As a general rule, the necessary information to describe the components or stages is
placed within the block. On some block diagrams, devices such as antennas and loudspeakers are shown by
standard symbols instead of by blocks (Fig. 2-5).

[CHAP. 2
Because a block diagram shows the functions of the various stages of a circuit and uses single lines, it is
a type of functional one-line diagram. The block diagram gives no information about speciﬁc components or
wiring connections. Therefore, it is limited in use but does give a simple way of illustrating the overall features
of a circuit. For this reason, block diagrams are frequently used by electricians, electronic technicians, and
engineers as a ﬁrst step in designing and laying out new equipment.
To show how easy it is to understand a circuit’s operation by means of a block diagram, look at Fig. 2-5.
The signal comes through the antenna and then progresses through the mixer circuit, through the intermediate-
frequency (IF) ampliﬁer stages and the detector stage, and ﬁnally to the output stage and speaker. The oscillator
is in an auxiliary circuit, and so it is not shown in the main signal path.
WIRING DIAGRAM
The wiring, or connection, diagram is used to show wiring connections in a simple, easy-to-follow way.
They are very commonly used with home appliances and electrical systems of automobiles (Fig. 2-6). The
typical wiring diagram shows the components of a circuit in a pictorial manner. The components are identiﬁed
by name. Such a diagram also often shows the relative location of the components within a given space.
A color-coding scheme may be used to identify certain wires or leads (Fig. 2-6).

ELECTRICAL PLAN
An integral part of any set of drawings for the construction of a building is the wiring plan or layout.
Architects, electrical designers, and contractors use ﬂoor-plan diagrams to locate components of the building’s
electrical system, such as receptacle outlets, switches, lighting ﬁxtures, and other wiring devices. These devices
and wiring arrangements are represented by means of symbols (Fig. 2-7). The living-room plan (Fig. 2-7) shows
two three-way switching arrangements. In one arrangement, a ceiling outlet is switched from two door locations.
Similarly, two receptacle outlets on the north wall are switched from two separate locations. The connection
between switch and ceiling outlet is drawn with a medium-weight solid line, indicating that the connection

Since an electric circuit is a path for current to ﬂow through, a break in this path would stop current
ﬂow. Switches are simply ways to break this path or to control the ﬂow of current. Some more symbols
for switches are shown in Fig. 2-10. To remember these switches, think of the number of poles as the
number of wires coming to either side of the switch. The throws can be thought of as the number of

The ground symbol is often used in schematic diagrams. Some components are grounded to the frame
or chassis of the equipment in which they are located. Aircraft, automobiles, and TV sets are grounded
in this fashion. A frame or other ground must be a good conductor. The ground (frame) is the return
path for current back to the power source. For the circuit shown in Fig. 2-11, complete the circuit by
putting in the ground symbols:

See Fig. 2-12. In this circuit, current ﬂows from the plus terminal of the battery, through the switch
to the lamp to ground, and then to the negative terminal of the battery. Since both the battery and the
lamp are grounded to the frame, there is a complete circuit.

Ohm’s Law and Power
THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
A practical electric circuit has at least four parts: (1) a source of electromotive force, (2) conductors,
(3) a load, and (4) a means of control (Fig. 3-1). The emf is the battery, the conductors are wires that connect
the various parts of the circuit and conduct the current, the resistor is the load, and the switch is the control
device. The most common sources of emf are batteries and generators. Conductors are wires which offer low
resistance to a current. The load resistor represents a device that uses electric energy, such as a lamp, bell,
toaster, radio, or a motor. Control devices might be switches, variable resistances, fuses, circuit breakers, or
relays.
Fig. 3-1
Closed circuit
A complete or closed circuit (Fig. 3-1) is an unbroken path for current from the emf, through a load, and
back to the source. A circuit is called incomplete or open (Fig. 3-2a) if a break in the circuit does not provide
a complete path for current.
Fig. 3-2
Open and short circuits
To protect a circuit, a fuse is placed directly into the circuit (Fig. 3-2b). A fuse will open the circuit
whenever a dangerously large current starts to ﬂow. A fuse will permit currents smaller than the fuse value to
ﬂow but will melt and therefore break or open the circuit if a larger current ﬂows. A dangerously large current
will ﬂow when a “short circuit” occurs. A short circuit is usually caused by an accidental connection between
two points in a circuit which offers very little resistance (Fig. 3-2b).
A ground symbol is often used to show that a number of wires are connected to a common point in a
circuit. For example, in Fig. 3-3a, conductors are shown making a complete circuit, while in Fig. 3-3b, the
same circuit is shown with two ground symbols at G1 and G2. Since the ground symbol means that the two
points are connected to a common point, electrically the two circuits (Fig. 3-3a and b) are exactly the same.

RESISTANCE
Resistance is the opposition to current ﬂow. To add resistance to a circuit, electrical components called
resistors are used. A resistor is a device whose resistance to current ﬂow is a known, speciﬁed value. Resistance
is measured in ohms and is represented by the symbol R in equations. One ohm is deﬁned as that amount of
resistance that will limit the current in a conductor to one ampere when the voltage applied to the conductor
is one volt.
Resistors are common components of many electrical and electronic devices. Some frequent uses for
resistors are to establish the proper value of circuit voltage, to limit current, and to provide a load.
FIXED RESISTORS
A ﬁxed resistor is one that has a single value of resistance which remains constant under normal conditions.
The two main types of ﬁxed resistors are carbon-composition and wire-wound resistors.
Carbon-Composition Resistors
The resistance element is primarily graphite or some other form of solid carbon carefully made to provide
the desired resistance. These resistors generally are inexpensive and have resistance values that range from
0.1  to 22 M.
Wire-Wound Resistors
The resistance element is usually nickel–chromium wire wound on a ceramic rod. The entire assembly
is normally covered with a ceramic material or a special enamel. They have resistance values from 1  to
100 k.
The actual resistance of a resistor may be greater or less than its rated or nominal value. The limit of
actual resistance is called tolerance. Common tolerances of carbon-composition resistors are ±5, ±10, and
±20 percent. For example, a resistor having a rated resistance of 100  and a tolerance of ±10 percent may

 
CHAP. 3]
OHM’S LAW AND POWER
41
have an actual resistance of any value between 90 and 110 , that is, 10  less or more than the rated value
of 100. Wire-wound resistors usually have a tolerance of ±5 percent.
Resistors having high tolerances of ±20 percent can still be used in many electric circuits. The advantage
of using a high-tolerance resistor in any circuit where it is permissible is that it is less expensive than a
low-tolerance resistor.
The power rating of a resistor (sometimes called the “wattage” rating) indicates how much heat a resistor
can dissipate, or throw off, before being damaged. If more heat is generated than can be dissipated, the resistor
will be damaged. The power rating is speciﬁed in watts. Carbon-composition resistors have wattage ratings
which range from 1/16 to 2 W, while wire-wound resistors have ratings from 3 W to hundreds of watts.
The physical size of a resistor is no indication of its resistance. A tiny resistor can have a very low or a
very high resistance. The physical size, however, gives some indication of its power rating. For a given value
of resistance, the physical size of a resistor increases as the power rating increases.
VARIABLE RESISTORS
Variable resistors are used to vary or change the amount of resistance in a circuit. Variable resistors are
called potentiometers or rheostats. Potentiometers generally consist of carbon-composition resistance elements,
while the resistance element in a rheostat is usually made of resistance wire. In both devices, a sliding arm
makes contact with the stationary resistance element (Fig. 3-5).
Fig. 3-5
When the sliding arm of a variable resistor is moved, the resistance between the center terminal and end terminals
changes
As the sliding arm rotates, its point of contact on the resistance element changes, thus changing the
resistance between the sliding arm terminal and the terminals of the stationary resistance (Fig. 3-5).
Rheostats are often used to control very high currents such as those found in motor and lamp loads
(Fig. 3-6).
Fig. 3-6
Use of rheostat to control current in a lamp
circuit
Fig. 3-7
Use of potentiometer to change voltage
Potentiometers can be used to vary the value of voltage applied to a circuit (Fig. 3-7). In this circuit, the
input voltage is applied across the terminals AC of the stationary resistance. By varying the position of the
sliding arm (terminal B), the voltage across terminals BC will change. As the sliding arm moves closer to

 
42
OHM’S LAW AND POWER
[CHAP. 3
terminal C, the voltage of the output circuit decreases. As the sliding arm moves closer to terminal A, the output
voltage of the circuit increases. Potentiometers as control devices are found in ampliﬁers, radios, television sets,
and electrical instruments. The rating of a variable resistor is the resistance of the entire stationary resistance
element from one end terminal to the other.
OHM’S LAW
Ohm’s law deﬁnes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. There are three ways to
express Ohm’s law mathematically.
1.
The current in a circuit is equal to the voltage applied to the circuit divided by the resistance of the
circuit:
I = V
R
(3-1)
2.
The resistance of a circuit is equal to the voltage applied to the circuit divided by the current in the
circuit:
R = V
I
(3-2)
3.
The applied voltage to a circuit is equal to the product of the current and the resistance of the circuit:
V = I × R = IR
(3-3)
where
I = current, A
R = resistance, 
V = voltage, V
If you know any two of the quantities V , I, and R, you can calculate the third.
The Ohm’s law equations can be memorized and practiced effectively by using an Ohm’s law circle
(Fig. 3-8a). To ﬁnd the equation for V , I, or R when two quantities are known, cover the unknown third
quantity with your ﬁnger.
Fig. 3-8
The Ohm’s law circle
The other two quantities in the circle will indicate how the covered quantity may be found (Fig. 3-8b).

Example 3.4

Ans.
Example 3.5
An electric light bulb draws 1.0 A when operating on a 120-V dc circuit. What is the resistance of the
bulb?
The ﬁrst step in solving a circuit problem is to sketch a schematic diagram of the circuit itself, labeling each of the
parts and showing the known values (Fig. 3-9).

Since I and V are known, we use Eq. (3-2) to solve for R.
R = V
I = 120

Ans.
ELECTRIC POWER
The electric power P used in any part of a circuit is equal to the current I in that part multiplied by the
voltage V across that part of the circuit. Its formula is
P = VI
(3-4)
where
P = power, W
V = voltage, V
I = current, A
Other forms for P = VI are I = P/V and V = P/I.

 
44
OHM’S LAW AND POWER
[CHAP. 3
If we know the current I and the resistance R but not the voltage V , we can ﬁnd the power P by using
Ohm’s law for voltage, so that substituting
V = IR
(3-3)
into Eq. (3-4) we have
P = IR × I = I 2R
(3-5)
In the same manner, if we know the voltage V and the resistance R but not the current I, we can ﬁnd the
power P by using Ohm’s law for current, so that substituting
I = V
R
(3-1)
into Eq. (3-4) we have
P = V V
R = V 2

If you know any two of the quantities, you can calculate the third.
Example 3.6
The current through a 100- resistor to be used in a circuit is 0.20 A. Find the power rating of the resistor.
Since I and R are known, use Eq. (3-5) to ﬁnd P.
P = I2R = (0.20)2(100) = 0.04(100) = 4 W
Ans.
To prevent a resistor from burning out, the power rating of any resistor used in a circuit should be twice the wattage
calculated by the power equation. Hence, the resistor used in this circuit should have a power rating of 8 W.
Example 3.7
How many kilowatts of power are delivered to a circuit by a 240-V generator that supplies 20 A to the
circuit?
Since V and I are given, use Eq. (3-4) to ﬁnd P.
P = VI = 240(20) = 4800 W = 4.8 kW
Ans.
Example 3.8
If the voltage across a 25 000- resistor is 500 V, what is the power dissipated in the resistor?
Since R and V are known, use Eq. (3-6) to ﬁnd P.
P = V 2
R = 5002
25 000 = 250 000
25 000 = 10 W
Ans.
HORSEPOWER
A motor is a device which converts electric power into the mechanical power of a rotating shaft. The
electric power supplied to a motor is measured in watts or kilowatts; the mechanical power delivered by
a motor is measured in horsepower (hp). One horsepower is equivalent to 746 W of electric power. The
metric system will be used to express horsepower in watts. For most calculations, it is sufﬁciently accurate

4 = 9

1 kW = 1000 W
W = 1000(0.563) = 563
Ans.
ELECTRIC ENERGY
Energy and work are essentially the same and are expressed in identical units. Power is different, however,
because it is the time rate of doing work. With the watt unit for power, one watt used during one second equals
the work of one joule, or one watt is one joule per second. The joule (J) is a basic practical unit of work or
energy (see Table 2-3).
The kilowatthour (kWh) is a unit commonly used for large amounts of electric energy or work. The amount
of kilowatthours is calculated as the product of the power in kilowatts (kW) and the time in hours (h) during
which the power is used.
kWh = kW × h

6 A:
P = 62(25) = 900 W
Ans.
1.5 A:
P = (1.5)2 = (25) = 56.2 W
Ans.
If the current is doubled to 6A from 3 A, the power will increase by 22, or 4, so 900 W = 4 ×
225 W. If the current is halved to 1.5 A from 3 A, the power will decrease by (1/2)2, or 1/4, so
56.2 W = 1/4 × 225 W. We see that if R does not change, power will change according to the square
of the change in current.

The efﬁciency of a motor is calculated by dividing its output by its input. The output is measured in

Electric utility companies establish their rates at a given number of cents per kilowatthour. Rates for
electric energy in the United States depend upon the method by which the electricity is generated, the
type and complexity of the transmission and distribution systems, the maintenance cost, and many
other factors. By knowing the amount of energy you use (from the meter readings) and the cost per
kilowatthour of energy in your area, you can calculate your own monthly electric bill.
One residence used 820 kWh of electric energy in one month. If the utility rate is 6 cents per
kilowatthour, what was the owner’s electrical bill for the month?
A convenient formula for calculating the total cost is:
Total cost = kWh × unit cost
= 820 × 6 cents = 4920 cents = $49.20∗
Ans.
∗Here we are using an average unit cost. Most utility rates are stepped according to blocks of kilowatthour usage plus minimum
charges, not to mention full adjustment charges and taxes.

Direct-Current Series Circuits
VOLTAGE, CURRENT, AND RESISTANCE IN SERIES CIRCUITS
A series circuit is a circuit in which there is only one path for current to ﬂow along. In the series circuit
(Fig. 4-1), the current I is the same in all parts of the circuit. This means that the current ﬂowing through R1
is the same as the current through R2, is the same as the current through R3, and is the same as the current
supplied by the battery.
Fig. 4-1
A series circuit
When resistances are connected in series (Fig. 4-1), the total resistance in the circuit is equal to the sum
of the resistances of all the parts of the circuit, or
RT = R1 + R2 + R3
(4-1)
where
RT = total resistance, 
R1, R2, and R3 = resistance in series, 
Example 4.1
A series circuit has a 50-, a 75-, and a 100- resistor in series (Fig. 4-2). Find the total resistance of
the circuit.
Fig. 4-2
Use Eq. (4-1) and add the values of the three resistors in series.
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 = 50 + 75 + 100 = 225 
Ans.
The total voltage across a series circuit is equal to the sum of the voltages across each resistance of the
circuit (Fig. 4-3), or
VT = V1 + V2 + V3
(4-2)
52

 
CHAP. 4]
DIRECT-CURRENT SERIES CIRCUITS
53
where
VT = total voltage, V
V1 = voltage across resistance R1, V
V2 = voltage across resistance R2, V
V3 = voltage across resistance R3, V
Although Eqs. (4-1) and (4-2) were applied to circuits containing only three resistances, they are applicable
to any number of resistances n; that is,
RT = R1 + R2 + R3 + · · · + Rn
(4-1a)
VT = V1 + V2 + V3 + · · · + Vn
(4-2a)
Ohm’s law may be applied to an entire series circuit or to the individual parts of the circuit. When it is
used on a particular part of a circuit, the voltage across that part is equal to the current in that part multiplied
by the resistance of the part. For the circuit shown in Fig. 4-3,
V1 = IR1
V2 = IR2
V3 = IR3
Fig. 4-3
Fig. 4-4
Example 4.2
A series circuit has 6 V across R1, 30 V across R2, and 54 V across R3 (Fig. 4-4). What is the total voltage
across the circuit?
Write Eq. (4-2) and add the voltage across each of the three resistances.
VT = V1 + V2 + V3 = 6 + 30 + 54 = 90 V
Ans.
To ﬁnd the total voltage across a series circuit, multiply the current by the total resistance, or
VT = IRT
(4-3)
where
VT = total voltage, V
I = current, A
RT = total resistance, 
Remember that in a series circuit, the same current ﬂows in every part of the circuit. Do not add the current
in each part of the circuit to obtain I in the Eq. (4-3).
Example 4.3
A resistor of 45  and a bell of 60  are connected in series (Fig. 4-5). What voltage is required across
this combination to produce a current of 0.3 A?

190 = 0.5 A
Step 3.
Find the voltage across each part. In a series circuit, the current is the same in each part; that is, I = 0.5 A
through each resistor.
V1 = IR1 = 0.5(20) = 10 V
Ans.
V2 = IR2 = 0.5(50) = 25 V
Ans.
V3 = IR3 = 0.5(120) = 60 V
Ans.
The voltages V1, V2, and V3 found in Example 4.4 are known as voltage drops or IR drops. Their effect
is to reduce the voltage that is available to be applied across the rest of the components in the circuit. The
sum of the voltage drops in any series circuit is always equal to the voltage that is applied to the circuit. This
relationship is expressed in Eq. (4-2), where the total voltage VT is the same as the applied voltage, and can
be veriﬁed in Example 4.4.
VT = V1 + V2 + V3
95 = 10 + 25 + 60
95 V = 95 V
Check
POLARITY OF VOLTAGE DROPS
When there is a voltage drop across a resistance, one end must be more positive or more negative than
the other end. The polarity of the voltage drop is determined by the direction of conventional current from a
positive to a more negative potential. Current direction is through R1 from point A to B (Fig. 4-7). Therefore
the end of R1 connected to point A has a more positive potential than point B. We say that the voltage
across R1 is such that point A is more positive than point B. Similarly, the voltage of point C is positive
Fig. 4-7
Polarity of voltage drops

 
56
DIRECT-CURRENT SERIES CIRCUITS
[CHAP. 4
with respect to point D. Another way to look at polarity between any two points is that the one nearer to
the positive terminal of the voltage source is more positive; also, the point nearer to the negative terminal of
the applied voltage is more negative. Therefore, point A is more positive than B, while D is more negative
than C (Fig. 4-7).
Example 4.5
Refer to Example 4.4. Ground the negative terminal of the 95-V battery (Fig. 4-6). Mark the polarity of
voltage drops in the circuit (Fig. 4-8), and ﬁnd the voltage values at points A, B, C, and D with respect to ground.
Fig. 4-8
Trace the complete circuit in the direction of current from the positive terminal of the battery to A, A to B, B to C,
C to D, and D to the negative terminal. Mark plus (+) where current enters each resistor and minus (−) where current
leaves each resistor (Fig. 4-8).
The voltage drops calculated in Example 4.4 are indicated (Fig. 4-8). Point A is the nearest point to the positive side
of the terminal, so voltage at A is
VA = +95 V
Ans.
There is a voltage drop of 10 V across R1, so voltage at B is
VB = 95 −10 = +85 V
Ans.
There is a voltage drop of 25 V across R2, so voltage at C is
VC = 85 −25 = +60 V
Ans.
There is a voltage drop of 60 V across R3, so voltage at D is
VD = 60 −60 = 0 V
Ans.
Since we grounded the circuit at D, VD must equal 0 V. If on tracing the voltage values, we ﬁnd that VD is not equal
to 0 V, then we have made an error.
CONDUCTORS
A conductor is a material having many free electrons. Three good electrical conductors are copper,
silver, and aluminum. Generally most metals are good conductors. Copper is the most common material

 
CHAP. 4]
DIRECT-CURRENT SERIES CIRCUITS
57
used in electrical conductors. Second to copper is aluminum. Certain gases are also used as conductors
under special conditions. For example, neon gas, mercury vapor, and sodium vapor are used in various
kinds of lamps.
Conductors have very low resistance. A typical value for copper wire is less than 1  for 10 feet (ft).
The function of the wire conductor is to connect a source of applied voltage to a load resistance with a
minimum IR voltage drop in the conductor so that most of the applied voltage can produce current in the load
resistance.
Example 4.6
The resistance of two 10-ft lengths of copper wire conductors is about 0.05 , which is very small
compared with the 150- resistance of the tungsten ﬁlament in the bulb shown in Fig. 4-9a. The conductors should have
minimum resistance to light the bulb with full brilliance. When the current of 0.8 A ﬂows in the bulb and series conductors,
the IR voltage drop across the conductors is 0.04 V, with 109.96 V across the bulb (Fig. 4.9b). Practically all the applied
voltage of 110 V is across the ﬁlament of the bulb.
Fig. 4-9
Wire Measurement
Table 4-1 lists the standard wire sizes which correspond to the American Wire Gauge (AWG). The gauge
numbers specify the size of round wire in terms of its diameter and cross-sectional circular area. Note the
following:
1.
As the gauge numbers increase from 1 to 40, the diameter and circular area decrease. Higher gauge
numbers mean smaller wire sizes. Thus, No. 12 is a smaller wire than No. 4.
2.
The circular area doubles for every three gauge sizes. For example, No. 12 wire has about twice the
area of No. 15 wire.
3.
The higher the gauge number and the smaller the wire, the greater the resistance of the wire for
any given length. Therefore, for 1000 ft of wire, No. 12 has a resistance of 1.62  while No. 4 has
0.253 .
In typical house wiring applications, No. 14 or No. 12 wire is used for circuits where the current is not
expected to exceed 15 A. Hookup wire for radio receiver circuits with current in milliamperes is about No. 22
wire. For this size, 0.5–1 A is the maximum current the wire can carry without excessive heating.
The cross-sectional area of round wire is measured in circular mils (abbreviated cmil or CM). A mil is
one-thousandth of an inch (0.001 in). One circular mil is the cross-sectional area of a wire having a diam-
eter of one mil. The number of circular mils in any circular area is equal to the square of the diameter
in mils, or
cmil = CM = d2

Find the area in circular mils of a wire with a diameter of 0.004 in.
First, convert the diameter to mils: 0.004 in = 4 mil. Then use Eq. (4-4) to ﬁnd the cross-sectional area.
CM = d2 = (4 mil)2 = 16
Ans.
To prevent the conductors from short-circuiting to each other or to some other metal in the circuit, the wires
are insulated. The insulator material should have very high resistance, be tough, and age without becoming
brittle.
Resistivity
For any conductor, the resistance of a given length depends upon the resistivity of the material, the length
of the wire, and the cross-sectional area of the wire according to the formula
R = ρ l
A
(4-5)
where
R = resistance of the conductor, 
l = length of the wire, ft
A = cross-sectional area of the wire, CM

CHAP. 4]
DIRECT-CURRENT SERIES CIRCUITS
59
The factor ρ (Greek letter rho, pronounced “roe”) permits different materials to be compared for resistance
according to their nature without regard to different lengths or areas. Higher values of ρ mean more resistance.
Table 4-2 lists resistance values for different metals having the standard wire size of a 1-ft length with a
cross-sectional area of 1 CM. Since silver, copper, gold, and aluminum have the lowest values of resistivity,
they are the best conductors. Tungsten and iron have a much higher resistivity.

DIRECT-CURRENT SERIES CIRCUITS
[CHAP. 4
Temperature Coefﬁcient
The temperature coefﬁcient of resistance, α (Greek letter alpha), indicates how much the resistance changes
for a change in temperature. A positive value for α means R increases with temperature; a negative α means
R decreases; and a zero α means R is constant, not varying with changes in temperature. Typical values of α
are listed in Table 4-2.
Although for a given material, α may vary slightly with temperature, an increase in wire resistance caused
by a rise in temperature can be approximately determined from the equation
Rt = R0 + R0(αT )
(4-6)
where
Rt = higher resistance at higher temperature, 
R0 = resistance at 20◦C, 
α = temperature coefﬁcient, /◦C
T = temperature rise above 20◦C, ◦C
Note that carbon has a negative temperature coefﬁcient (Table 4-2). In general, α is negative for all
semiconductors such as germanium and silicon. A negative value for α means less resistance at higher tem-
peratures. Therefore, the resistance of semiconductor diodes and transistors can be reduced considerably when
they become hot with normal load current. Observe also that constantan has a value of zero for α (Table 4-2).
Thus it can be used for precision wire-wound resistors, which do not change resistance when the temperature
increases.
Example 4.10
A tungsten wire has a 10- resistance at 20◦C. Find its resistance at 120◦C.
From Table 4-2,
α = 0.005 /◦C
The temperature rise is
T = 120 −20 = 100◦C
Substituting into Eq. (4-6),
Rt = R0 + R0(αT ) = 10 + 10(0.005 × 100) = 10 + 5 = 15 
Ans.
Because of the 100◦C rise in temperature, the wire resistance is increased by 5 , or 50 percent of its original value
of 10 .
TOTAL POWER IN A SERIES CIRCUIT
We found that Ohm’s law could be used for total values in a series circuit as well as for individual parts
of the circuit. Similarly, the formula for power may be used for total values.
PT = IVT
(4-7)
where
PT = total power, W
I = current, A
VT = total voltage, V
The total power PT produced by the source in a series circuit can also be expressed as the sum of the
individual powers used in each part of the circuit.
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 + · · · + Pn

VOLTAGE DROP BY PROPORTIONAL PARTS
In a series circuit, each resistance provides a voltage drop V equal to its proportional part of the applied
voltage. Stated as an equation,
V = R
RT
VT
(4-9)
where
V = voltage, V
R = resistance, 
RT = total resistance, 
R/RT = proportional part of resistance
VT = total voltage, V
A higher resistance R has a greater voltage drop than a smaller resistance in the same series circuit. Equal
resistances have equal voltage drops.

Compare the effect on voltage drop of a 1- resistor and a 99- resistor in series.
Because series voltage drops are proportional to the resistances, a very small resistance (1 ) has
a very small effect in series with a much larger resistance (99 ). For example, if the applied voltage
were 100 V, the voltage drop across the 1- resistor would be 1 V [(1/100)(100) = 1 V], while across
the 99- resistor it would be 99 V [(99/100)(100) = 99 V].

Direct-Current Parallel Circuits
VOLTAGE AND CURRENT IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT
A parallel circuit is a circuit in which two or more components are connected across the same voltage
source (Fig. 5-1). The resistors R1, R2, and R3 are in parallel with each other and with the battery. Each
parallel path is then a branch with its own individual current. When the total current IT leaves the voltage
source V , part I1 of the current IT will ﬂow through R1, part I2 will ﬂow through R2, and the remainder I3
through R3. The branch currents I1, I2, and I3 can be different. However, if a voltmeter (an instrument for
measuring the voltage of a circuit) is connected across R1, R2, and R3, the respective voltages V1, V2, and V3
will be equal. Therefore,
V = V1 = V2 = V3
(5-1)
Fig. 5-1
A parallel circuit
The total current IT is equal to the sum of all branch currents.
IT = I1 + I2 + I3
(5-2)
This formula applies for any number of parallel branches whether the resistances are equal or unequal.
By Ohm’s law, each branch current equals the applied voltage divided by the resistance between the two
points where the voltage is applied. Hence (Fig. 5-1), for each branch we have the following equations:
Branch 1:
I1 = V1
R1
= V
R1
Branch 2:
I2 = V2
R2
= V
R2
(5-3)
Branch 3:
I3 = V3
R3

With the same applied voltage, any branch that has less resistance allows more current through it than a branch
with higher resistance.

RESISTANCES IN PARALLEL
Total Resistance
The total resistance in a parallel circuit is found by applying Ohm’s law: Divide the common voltage
across the parallel resistances by the total line current.
RT = V
IT
(5-4)
RT is the total resistance of all the parallel branches across the voltage source V , and IT is the sum of all the
branch currents.
Example 5.4
What is the total resistance of the circuit shown in Fig. 5-4 (Example 5.3)?
In Example 5.3 the line voltage is 120 V and the total line current is 26 A. Therefore,
RT = V

Ans.
Note that when resistances are connected in parallel, the total resistance is always less than the resistance of any single
branch. In this case, RT = 1.14  is less than R1 = 2 , R2 = 4 , and R3 = 8 .

In some cases with two parallel resistors, it is useful to ﬁnd what size Rx to connect in parallel with a

OPEN AND SHORT CIRCUITS
An “open” in any part of a circuit is, in effect, an extremely high resistance that results in no current
ﬂow in the circuit. When there is an open in the main line (the “X” in Fig. 5-8a), current to all the parallel
branches is stopped. When there is an open in one branch (branch 2 in Fig. 5-8b), only that branch will have no
current. However, current in branches 1 and 3 will continue to ﬂow as long as they are connected to the voltage
source.

Short in parallel circuit
A“short” in any part of a circuit is, in effect, an extremely low resistance. The result is that very high current
will ﬂow through the short circuit. Assume that a conducting wire at point a in Fig. 5-9 should accidentally
contact the wire at point b. Since the wire is an excellent conductor, the short circuit offers a parallel path with
practically zero resistance from points a to b. Almost all the current will ﬂow in this path. Since the resistance
of the short circuit is practically zero, the voltage drop across ab will be almost zero (by Ohm’s law). Thus
resistors R1, R2, and R3 will not draw their normal current.
Example 5.10
Find the current in each parallel branch (Fig. 5-10a). If the resistor in the second branch burns out,

Ans.
I2 = 0 A
Ans.
Branch 1 still operates normally at 0.5 A. This example shows the advantage of wiring components in parallel. An open
circuit in one component merely opens the branch containing the component, while the other parallel branch keeps its
normal voltage and current.
DIVISION OF CURRENT IN TWO PARALLEL BRANCHES
It is sometimes necessary to ﬁnd the individual branch currents in a parallel circuit if the resistances and
total current are known, but the voltage across the resistance bank is not known. When only two branches are
involved, the current in one branch will be some fraction of the total current. This fraction is the quotient of
the second resistance divided by the sum of the resistances.
I1 =
R2
R1 + R2
IT
(5-9)
I2 =
R2
R1 + R2
IT
(5-10)
where I1 and I2 are the currents in the respective branches. Notice that the equation for each branch current
has the opposite R in the numerator. The reason is that each branch current is inversely proportional to
the branch resistance. The denominator is the same in both equations, equal to the sum of the two branch
resistances.
Example 5.11
Find the branch currents I1 and I2 for the circuit shown in Fig. 5-11.

Since IT and I1 were known, we could have found I2 simply by subtracting:
IT = I1 + I2
I2 = IT −I1 = 18 −12 = 6 A
Ans.
CONDUCTANCES IN PARALLEL
Conductance is the opposite of resistance. The less the resistance, the higher the conductance. The symbol
for conductance is G and its unit is siemens (S). G is the reciprocal of R, or
G = 1
R
(5-11)
For example, 6  resistance is equal to 1/6 S conductance.
Since conductance is equal to the reciprocal of resistance, the reciprocal resistance equation, Eq. (5-5),
can be written for conductance as
GT = G1 + G2 + G3 + · · · + Gn
(5-12)
where GT is the total conductance in parallel and G1, G2, G3, and Gn are the branch conductances.
Example 5.12
Find the total conductance of the circuit in Fig. 5-12. Then ﬁnd the total resistance RT and check the
value with that computed in Example 5.5.
Fig. 5-12
This circuit is the same as that of Fig. 5-6 used in Example 5.5. Convert each branch resistance to conductance, using
Eq. (5-11), and then add the values of conductance to obtain GT .

Given are V = 100 V and GT = 0.875 S. Using Eq. (5-13),
IT = V GT = 100(0.875) = 87.5 A
Ans.
POWER IN PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Since the power dissipated in the branch resistance must come from the voltage source, the total power
equals the sum of the individual values of power in each branch.
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 + · · · + Pn
(5-14)
where PT is the total power and P1, P2, P3, and Pn are the branch powers.
Total power can also be calculated by the equation
PT = V IT
(5-15)
where PT is the total power, V is the voltage source across all parallel branches, and IT is the total current.
The power P dissipated in each branch is equal to VI and equal to V 2/R.
In both parallel and series arrangements, the sum of the individual values of power dissipated in the circuit
equals the total power generated by the source. The circuit arrangements cannot change the fact that all power
in the circuit comes from the source.

Ans.
Then add these values for power in each branch to ﬁnd PT .
PT = P1 + P2
(5-14)

Ans.
Another way to ﬁnd PT is to solve for IT .

Then
PT = V IT

The 120 W of power supplied by the source is dissipated in the branch resistances.

Batteries
THE VOLTAIC CELL
A voltaic chemical cell is a combination of materials used to convert chemical energy into electric energy.
The chemical cell consists of two electrodes made of different kinds of metals or metallic compounds, and an
electrolyte, which is a solution capable of conducting an electric current (Fig. 6-1a). A battery is formed when
two or more cells are connected.
Fig. 6-1
Basic chemical action of a voltaic cell
An excellent example of a pair of electrodes is zinc and copper. Zinc contains an abundance of negatively
charged atoms, while copper has an abundance of positively charged atoms. When plates of these metals are
immersed in an electrolyte, chemical action between the two begins. The zinc electrode accumulates a much
larger negative charge since it gradually dissolves into the electrolyte. The atoms which leave the zinc electrode
are positively charged. They are attracted by the negatively charged ions (−) of the electrolyte, while they
repel the positively charged ions (+) of the electrolyte toward the copper electrode (Fig. 6-1b). This causes
97

 
98
BATTERIES
[CHAP. 6
electrons to be removed from the copper, leaving it with an excess of positive charge. If a load such as a
light bulb is connected across the terminals on the electrodes, the forces of attraction and repulsion will cause
free electrons in the negative zinc electrode, connecting wires, and light bulb ﬁlament to move toward the
positively charged copper electrode (Fig. 6-1c). The potential difference that results permits the cell to function
as a source of applied voltage V (Fig. 6-1d).
The electrolyte of a cell may be liquid or a paste. If the electrolyte is a liquid, the cell is often called a
wet cell. If the electrolyte is in a paste form, the cell is referred to as a dry cell.
SERIES AND PARALLEL CELLS
When cells are connected in series (Fig. 6-2), the total voltage across the battery of cells is equal to the
sum of the voltage of each of the individual cells. In Fig. 6-2, the four 1.5-V cells in series provide a total
battery voltage of 6 V. When cells are placed in series, the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the
negative terminal of the other cell. The current ﬂowing through such a battery of series cells is the same as for
one cell because the same current ﬂows through all the series cells.
Fig. 6-2
Cells in series
To obtain a greater current, the battery has cells in parallel (Fig. 6-3). When cells are placed in parallel, all
the positive terminals are connected together and all the negative terminals are connected together. Any point

CHAP. 6]

99
on the positive side can serve as the positive terminal of the battery and any point on the negative side can be
the negative terminal.
The total voltage output of a battery of three parallel cells is the same as that for a single cell (Fig. 6-3), but
the available current is three times that of one cell. The parallel connection has the same effect of increasing
the size of the electrodes and electrolyte in a single cell, which increases the current capacity.
Identical cells in parallel all supply equal parts of the current to the load. For example, of three identical
parallel cells producing a load current of 270 mA, each cell contributes 90 mA.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CELLS
Primary cells are those which cannot be recharged or returned to good condition after their voltage output
drops too low. Dry cells used in ﬂashlights and transistor radios are examples of primary cells.
Secondary cells are those which are rechargeable. During recharging, the chemicals which provide electric
energy are restored to their original condition. Recharging is done by passing direct current through a cell in
a direction opposite to the direction of the current which the cell delivers to a circuit.
A cell is recharged by connecting it to a battery charger in “like-to-like” polarity (Fig. 6-4). Some battery
chargers have a voltmeter and an ammeter which indicate the charging voltage and current.
Fig. 6-4
Recharging a secondary cell with
a battery charger
The most common example of a secondary cell is an automobile storage battery. Secondary cells or batteries
are particularly useful for powering mobile equipment where a generator is available to keep them charged.
Smaller, sealed secondary cells are used to power such portable equipment as shavers, electronic calculators,
radios, and television receivers. These can be easily charged from ordinary house current by simple, low-cost
chargers often built into the equipment or appliance itself.
TYPES OF BATTERIES
Lead–Acid Battery
The lead–acid battery consists of a number of lead–acid cells. Each cell has two groups of lead plates; one
set is the positive terminal and the other is the negative terminal. All positive plates are connected together with
a connecting strap (Fig. 6-5). All negative plates are similarly connected together. The positive and negative
plates are interlaced so that alternately, there is a positive plate and a negative plate. Between the plates are
sheets of insulating material called separators, made either of porous wood, perforated wood, or ﬁberglass.
The separators prevent the positive and negative plates from touching each other and producing a short circuit,
which would destroy the cell. The positive plate is treated chemically to form lead peroxide (a combination
of lead and oxygen), and the negative electrode consists of porous, spongy lead. The two sets of plates with
the separators between them are placed in a container ﬁlled with a dilute solution of sulfuric acid and water.
The term lead–acid battery refers to the lead plates and sulfuric acid that are the principal components of the
battery.
The voltage in this type of cell is slightly more than 2 V. Batteries used in modern automobiles con-
tain six cells connected in series so that the output voltage from the battery is slightly more than 12 V.

B. Grob, Basic Electronics, 4th ed., McGraw-Hill,
New York, 1977, p. 247.)
Older automobiles made before the mid-1950s used batteries in which three cells were connected in series to
give an output voltage of slightly more than 6 V.
The storage battery can supply current for a much longer time than the average dry cell. When the storage
battery is discharged and is no longer able to supply the current required by the circuit, the battery can be
removed from the circuit and recharged by passing current through it in the opposite direction. Once the battery
has been recharged, it can again be connected to the circuit and will supply current to the circuit.
In an automobile, the battery is connected to a device called an alternator. As long as the car is running at
a reasonable speed, the alternator is both charging the battery and supplying the current needed to operate the
car. However, when the car is operated at a slow speed or when it is stopped, the alternator is not turning fast
enough to provide the electricity needed by the car. The battery then supplies this energy, causing it to slowly
discharge.
When the battery discharges, some of the acid of the electrolyte combines with the active material on the
plates (Fig. 6-6a). This chemical action changes the material in both plates to lead sulfate. When the battery is
being charged by the alternator, the reverse action takes place, and the acid which was absorbed by the plates
is returned to the electrolyte (Fig. 6-6b). The result is that the active material on the plates is changed back into
the original (charged condition) lead peroxide and sponge lead, and the electrolyte is restored to its original
strength.
Whenever a battery is charging, the chemical action produces hydrogen gas on one plate surface and
oxygen gas on the other. These gases bubble to the surface and escape through the vent hole in the cap on the
cell. Thus water (H2O) is lost to the cell when the gases leave. The water that escapes must be replaced to
maintain the proper electrolyte level. Only distilled water should be added to the cell. Otherwise, any impurity
in the added water will combine chemically with the sulfuric acid on the plates and form a stable compound
that will not enter into the charge or discharge action of the battery.
Carbon–Zinc Cell
This is one of the oldest and most widely used commercial types of dry cell. The carbon, in the form of
a rod that is placed in the center of the cell, is the positive terminal. The case of the cell is made of zinc,
which is the negative electrode (Fig. 6-7). Between the carbon electrode and the zinc case is the electrolyte
of a chemical pastelike mixture. The cell is sealed to prevent the liquid in the paste from evaporating. The
voltage of a cell of this type is about 1.5 V.

Alkaline Cell
The secondary alkaline cell is so called because it has an alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide. One
battery type that goes by the name alkaline battery has a negative electrode of zinc and a positive electrode of
manganese dioxide. It generates 1.5 V.
The primary alkaline cell is similar in construction to the rechargeable type and has the same operating
voltage (Fig. 6-8). This cell has extended life over a carbon–zinc cell of the same size.

(From Grob, p. 253.)
Nickel–Cadmium Cell
In the secondary nickel–cadmium dry cell, the electrolyte is potassium hydroxide, the negative electrode
is nickel hydroxide, and the positive electrode is cadmium oxide. The operating voltage is 1.25 V. These cells
are manufactured in several sizes, including ﬂat button shapes. The nickel–cadmium battery is the only dry
battery that is a true storage battery with a reversible chemical reaction, allowing recharging many times
(Fig. 6-9). It is a rugged device which gives dependable service under extreme conditions of shock, vibration,
and temperature. Therefore, it is ideally suited for use in powering portable communication equipment such
as a two-way radio.
Edison Cell
A lighter, more rugged secondary cell than the lead–acid cell is the Edison, or nickel–iron–alkaline, cell.
It operates at a no-load voltage of 1.4 V. When the voltage drops to 1.0 V, the cell should be recharged. When
fully charged, it has a positive plate of nickel and nickel hydrate and a negative plate of iron. Like the lead–acid
cell, the Edison cell also produces hydrogen and oxygen gases. As a result, the electrolyte requires ﬁlling up
with distilled water.
Mercury Cell
There are two different types of mercury cells. One is a ﬂat cell that is shaped like a button, while the
other is a cylindrical cell that looks like a standard ﬂashlight cell. The advantage of the button-type cell is that
several of them can be stacked inside one container to form a battery. A typical battery is made up of three ﬂat
cells (Fig. 6-10). A cell produces 1.35 V.
Mercury cells and batteries have a good shelf life and are very rugged. Because they produce a constant
output voltage under different load conditions, they are used in many different products, including electric
watches, hearing aids, test instruments, and alarm systems.

BATTERY CHARACTERISTICS
Internal Resistance
A battery is a dc voltage generator. All generators have internal resistance, Ri. In a chemical cell, the resis-
tance of the electrolyte between electrodes is responsible for most of the cell’s internal resistance (Fig. 6-11).
Since any current in the battery must ﬂow through the internal resistance, Ri is in series with the gener-
ated voltage VB (Fig. 6-12a). With no current, the voltage drop across Ri is zero so that the full generated
voltage VB develops across the output terminals (Fig. 6-12a). This is the open-circuit voltage, or no-load
voltage. If a load resistance RL is connected across the battery, RL is in series with Ri (Fig. 6-12b). When
current IL ﬂows in this circuit, the internal voltage drop, ILRi, decreases the terminal voltage VL of the battery
so that VL = VB −ILRi.

Example 6.1
A dry battery has an open-circuit, or no-load, voltage of 100 V (Fig. 6-13). If the internal resistance is
100  and the load resistance is 600 , ﬁnd the voltage VL across the output terminals.
The battery is marked 100 V because 100 V is its open-circuit voltage. With no load, the load current is zero. When
load resistance RL is added, there is a closed circuit, and the load current is calculated by Ohm’s law.
IL =
V
Ri + RL
=
100
100 + 600 = 100
700 = 0.143 A
The internal battery drop is
ILRi = 0.143(100) = 14.3 V
so that the voltage at the battery’s terminal is
VL = VB −ILRi = 100 −14.3 = 85.7 V
Ans.
Fig. 6-13
Speciﬁc Gravity
The speciﬁc gravity of any liquid is a ratio comparing its weight with the weight of an equal volume of
water. Pure sulfuric acid has a speciﬁc gravity of 1.835 since it weighs 1.835 times as much as water per unit
volume.
The speciﬁc gravity of the electrolyte solution in a lead–acid cell ranges from 1.210 to 1.300 for new,
fully charged batteries. The higher the speciﬁc gravity, the less internal resistance of the cell and the higher
the possible load current. As the cell discharges, the water formed dilutes the acid and the speciﬁc gravity
gradually decreases to about 1.150, at which time the cell is considered to be fully discharged. Speciﬁc gravity is
measured with a hydrometer of the syringe type, which has a compressible rubber bulb at the top, a glass barrel,
and a rubber hose at the bottom of the barrel. In taking readings with a hydrometer, the decimal point is usually
omitted. For example, a speciﬁc gravity of 1.270 is read simply as “twelve-seventy.” A hydrometer reading of
1210 to 1300 indicates full charge; about 1250 is half-charge; and 1150 to 1200 is complete discharge.
Capacity
The capacity of a battery is rated in ampere-hours (Ah). The capacity of a storage battery determines how
long it will operate at a given discharge rate. For example, a 90-Ah battery must be recharged after 9 h of an
average 10-A discharge.
A cell of a lead–acid automobile battery, when fully charged, has an initial voltage of about 2.1 V at
no load, but discharges rapidly. The battery is “dead” after about 2 h of discharging under load condition.
However, under normal use, this battery type is constantly recharged by the alternator in the automobile.

 
CHAP. 6]

Shelf Life
The shelf life of a cell is that period of time during which the cell can be stored without losing more
than approximately 10 percent of its original capacity. The capacity of a cell is its ability to deliver a given
amount of current to the circuit in which it is used. The loss of capacity of a stored cell is primarily due
to the drying out of its electrolyte (wet cell) and to chemical actions which change the materials within the
cell. Since heat stimulates both these actions, the shelf life of a cell can be extended by keeping it in a cool,
dry place.

Kirchhoff’s Laws
KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW (KVL)
Kirchhoff’s voltage law states that the voltage applied to a closed circuit equals the sum of the voltage
drops in that circuit. This fact was used in the study of series circuits and was expressed as follows:
Voltage applied = sum of voltage drops
VA = V1 + V2 + V3
(7-1)
where VA is the applied voltage and V1, V2, and V3 are voltage drops.
Another way of stating KVL is that the algebraic sum of the voltage rises and voltage drops must be equal
to zero. A voltage source or emf is considered a voltage rise; a voltage across a resistor is a voltage drop.
Often for convenience in labeling, letter subscripts are shown for voltage sources and numerical subscripts
for voltage drops. This form of the law can be written by transposing the right members of Eq. (7-1) to the
left side.
Voltage applied −sum of voltage drops = 0
Substitute letters:
VA −V1 −V2 −V3 = 0
or
VA −(V1 + V2 + V3) = 0
Using a new symbol, , the Greek capital letter sigma, we have
V = VA −V1 −V2 −V3 = 0
(7-2)
in which V , the algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed circuit, equals zero.  means “sum of.”
We assign a + sign to a voltage rise and a −sign to a voltage drop for the V = 0 formula (Fig. 7-1).
In tracing voltage drops around a circuit, start at the negative terminal of the voltage source. The path from the
negative terminal to the positive terminal through the source is a voltage rise. We continue to trace the circuit
from the positive terminal through all resistors and back to the negative terminal of the source. In Fig. 7-1 if
we start at point a, the negative terminal of the battery, and move around the circuit in the direction abcda,
we go through VA from −to + and VA = +100 V. If we start at point b and move in the opposite direction
badcb, we go through VA from + to −and VA = −100 V. The voltage drop across any resistance will be
Fig. 7-1
Illustration of V = 0

CHAP. 7]
KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS
111
negative (−) if we trace it in the + to −direction. Thus in Fig. 7-1, if we trace the circuit in the direction
abcda, V1 = −50 V, V2 = −30 V, and V3 = −20 V. The voltage drop will be positive (+) if we go through
the resistance in the −to + direction. So in tracing the circuit in the direction abcda, we have
V = 0
VA −V1 −V2 −V3 = 0
100 −50 −30 −20 = 0
0 = 0
Example 7.1
Determine the direction of voltage around the circuit abcda (Fig. 7-2), and then write the expression for
voltages around the circuit.
Assume direction of current as shown. Mark the + and −polarities of each resistor.
VA is a voltage source (+).
(It is a voltage rise in the current direction assumed.)
V1 is a voltage drop (−).
(It is a decrease in the direction assumed.)
V2 is a voltage drop (−).
(It is a decrease in the direction assumed.)
VB is a voltage source (−).
(It is a decrease in voltage in the current direction assumed.)
V3 is a voltage drop (−).
(It is a decrease in the direction assumed.)
V = 0
+VA −V1 −V2 −VB −V3 = 0
Group the voltage rises and the voltage drops.
VA −(V1 + V2 + V3 + VB)
Notice that the voltage drops include a voltage source VB. Ordinarily a source would be positive. In this case the polarity
of the source is acting against the assumed direction of current. Therefore, its effect is to decrease the voltage.

VB = VA −V1 −V2 −V3 = 15 −3 −6 −2 = 4 V
Ans.
Since VB
was found to be positive,
the assumed direction of current is in fact the actual direction of
current.
KIRCHHOFF’S CURRENT LAW (KCL)
Kirchhoff’s current law states that the sum of the currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of the
currents leaving the junction. Suppose we have six currents leaving and entering a common junction or point,
shown as P (Fig. 7-4). This common point is also called a node.
Fig. 7-4
Currents at a common point
Sum of all currents entering = sum of all currents leaving
Substitute letters:
I1 + I3 + I4 + I6 = I2 + I5
If we consider that the currents ﬂowing toward a junction are positive (+) and those currents ﬂowing away
from the same junction are negative (−), then this law also states that the algebraic sum of all the currents
meeting at a common junction is zero. Using the symbol , we have
I = 0
(7-3)
where I, the algebraic sum of all the currents at the common point, is zero.
I1 −I2 + I3 + I4 −I5 + I6 = 0
If the negative terms are transposed to the right side of the equal sign, we would have the same form as the
original equation.

MESH CURRENTS
A simpliﬁcation of Kirchhoff’s laws is a method that makes use of mesh or loop currents. A mesh is any
closed path of a circuit. It does not matter whether the path contains a voltage source. In solving a circuit
with mesh currents, we must ﬁrst decide which paths will be the meshes. Then we assign a mesh current to
each mesh. For convenience, mesh currents are usually assigned in a clockwise direction. This direction is
arbitrary, but the clockwise direction is usually assumed. Kirchhoff’s voltage law is then applied about the
path of each mesh. The resulting equations determine the unknown mesh currents. From these currents, the
current or voltage of any resistor can be found.
Fig. 7-7
Two-mesh circuit
In Fig. 7-7, we have a two-mesh circuit marked mesh 1 and mesh 2. Mesh 1 is path abcda and mesh 2 is
path adefa. All voltage sources and resistances are known. A procedure for ﬁnding mesh currents I1 and I2 is
as follows:
Step 1.
After the meshes are selected, show the direction of mesh currents I1 and I2 in a clockwise direction.
Mark the voltage polarity across each resistor, consistent with the assumed current. Remember that
conventional current ﬂow in a resistor produces positive polarity where the current enters.
Step 2.
Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law, V = 0, around each mesh. Trace each mesh in the direction of mesh
current. Note that there are two different currents (I1, I2) ﬂowing in opposite directions through the
same resistor, R2, which is common to both meshes. For this reason two sets of polarities are shown
by R2 (Fig. 7-7). Trace mesh 1 in direction abcda.
+VA −I1R1 −I1R2 + I2R2 = 0
+VA −I1(R1 + R2) + I2R2 = 0
+I1(R1 + R2) −I2R2 = VA
(1)
Note that in the ﬁrst expression I2R2 is + since we go through a voltage drop from −to +.
Trace mesh 2 in direction adefa.
−I2R2 + I1R2 −I2R3 −VB = 0
+I1R2 −I2(R2 + R3) = VB
(2)
Note that I1R2 is a + voltage drop since we go through a voltage drop from −to +.
Step 3.
Find I1 and I2 by solving Eqs. (1) and (2) simultaneously.
Step 4.
When mesh currents are known, ﬁnd all resistor voltage drops by using Ohm’s law.

In this case, the assumed mesh current direction was correct because the current values are positive. If the current
value were negative, the true direction would be opposite to the assumed direction of current. (See Fig. 7-8b.)

NODE VOLTAGES
Another method for solving a circuit with mesh currents uses the voltage drops to specify the currents at
a node. Then node equations of currents are written to satisfy Kirchhoff’s current law. By solving the node
equations, we can calculate the unknown node voltages. A node is a common connection for two or more
components. A principal node has three or more connections. To each node in a circuit a letter or number is
assigned. A, B, G, and N are nodes, and G and N are principal nodes, or junctions (Fig. 7-9). A node voltage
is the voltage of a given node with respect to one particular node called the reference node. Select node G
connected to chassis ground as the reference node. Then VAG is the voltage between nodes A and G, VBG is
the voltage between nodes B and G, and VNG is the voltage between nodes N and G. Since the node voltage
is always determined with respect to a speciﬁed reference node, the notations VA for VAG, VB for VBG, and
VN for VNG are used.
With the exception of the reference node, equations using KCL can be written at each principal node.
Thus the required number of equations is one less than the number of principal nodes. Since the circuit shown
(Fig. 7-9) has two principal nodes (N and G), only one equation need be written at node N to ﬁnd all voltage
drops and currents in the circuit.

SECOND-ORDER DETERMINANTS
A determinant is an array of numbers or letters written in a square between vertical lines. The value of a
determinant is found by multiplying the elements (numbers or letters) of the determinant in a speciﬁed way.
A second-order determinant has four elements arrayed in two rows and two columns, such as
Column 1
Column 2
⏐⏐
⏐⏐
Row 1 −−−−→
Row 2 −−−−→

a11
a12
a21
a22

The four elements are a11, a12, a21, and a22. The ﬁrst subscript indicates the row, while the second subscript
indicates the column. Thus, the element a21 is in the second row and in the ﬁrst column.
The value of the second-order determinant by deﬁnition is
(8-1)
The rule for ﬁnding the value is to multiply together the elements on the diagonal lines, adding together those
on lines that slope down to the right, and subtracting those on lines that slope down to the left.
Example 8.1
Find the value of the following second-order determinants.
THIRD-ORDER DETERMINANTS
A third-order determinant has nine elements arrayed in three rows and three columns, such as

(8-2)
The rule for ﬁnding the value of a higher-order determinant is found by expanding the determinant in
terms of any one of its rows or columns. The selection of a row or column is random. For illustration, the ﬁrst
column is selected for expanding. When a11 is selected, a sub array (second-order determinant) is formed by
eliminating the row and column that intersects a11. This sub array is called a minor.
Similarly,
The cofactor of the element aij is deﬁned as the product of (−1)i+j and the minor determinant obtained
by deleting the ith row and jth column.
In the previous example, when a11 is selected, (−1)i+j = (−1)1+1 = (−1)2 = 1, so its cofactor
is
+1

a22

A convenient way to remember the algebraic signs is to refer to a checker board arrangement:

+

+
−
+
−
+

+

Start with the upper left-hand corner with the + sign. All the other signs follow automatically, regardless of
the number of elements in the determinant. Another way to remember the sign is when the sum of the row and
column values is even, the sign is +; and when the sum is odd, the sign is −. Thus, for the minor of a11, the
sum is 1 + 1 = 2, so the sign is +; and for a21, the sum is 2 + 1 = 3, so the sign is −.

CRAMER’S RULE
Cramer’s rule is a method to solve simultaneous linear equations by use of determinants. As an example,
consider two equations with two unknowns, x and y, where A and B are constants. (A linear equation is an

equation where the unknown terms, as x, y, z, . . . n, are only to the 1st degree. If the equation has the term x2
or xy, it is of the 2nd degree and therefore not linear.)

substitute A and B for a11 and a21, the coefﬁcients of x.
Let’s expand this example by considering three equations with three unknowns, x, y, and z, where A, B,
and C are constants.

DETERMINANT METHOD FOR SOLVING CURRENTS IN A TWO-MESH NETWORK
The determinant method for solving mesh currents is one whereby the determinant solution for mesh
currents can be written directly by inspecting the network without writing ﬁrst the proper simultaneous
equations.
For a network of two meshes, the determinant of the network is
 =

R11
−R12
−R21
R22

(8-11)
where R11 = total resistance of mesh 1
R22 = total resistance of mesh 2
R12 = mutual (common) resistance between mesh 1 and mesh 2
R21 = mutual (common) resistance between mesh 2 and mesh 1
Because the mutual resistances are equal, R12 = R21. Note that the sign for all mutual resistance is negative.
The formulas to solve for mesh currents I1 and I2 are

where V1 = net voltage for mesh 1
V2 = net voltage for mesh 2
The numerator determinant for I1, NI1, is formed by substituting the net voltage sources in column 1
of ; the numerator determinant for I2, NI2, is formed by substituting the net voltage sources in column 2
of . The polarity (+ or −) of V1 and V2 depends on the net voltage of the mesh as the mesh is traced in the
direction of the assumed current.
Example 8.5

Example 8.3 by use of simultaneous equations.)

Ans.
By successive expanding of the elements of the ﬁrst column, we reduce the order of the
determinant from four to three and then to two. By reducing the order of the determinant
eventually to two, you can solve explicitly for each mesh current. When n = 4, the expansion
of the ﬁrst column elements have signs of +, −, +, and −. (Compare to n = 3 where the
signs are +, −, and +.)

Network Calculations
Y AND DELTA NETWORKS
The network in Fig. 9-1 is called a T (“tee”) or Y (“wye”) network because of its shape. T and Y are different
names for the same network, except that in the Y network the Ra and Rb arms form the upper part of a Y.
Fig. 9-1
Form of a T or Y network
The network in Fig. 9-2 is called a Π (pi) or ∆(delta) network because its shape resembles these Greek
letters; Π and ∆are different names for the same network.
Fig. 9-2
Form of a Π or ∆network
In analyzing networks it is helpful to convert Y to ∆or ∆to Y to simplify the solution. The formulas for
these conversions are derived from Kirchhoff’s laws. Note that resistances in Y have subscript letters, Ra, Rb,
and Rc, while the resistances in ∆are numbered R1, R2, and R3.
Resistances are shown in a three-terminal network with three terminals a, b, and c. After the conversion
formulas are used, one network is equivalent to the other because they have equivalent resistances across any
one pair of terminals.

Conversion between Y and

Rule 1:
The rule for ∆to Y conversion can be stated as follows: The resistance of any branch of the Y
network is equal to the product of the two adjacent sides of the ∆network divided by the sum of the
three ∆resistances.

Rule 2:
The rule for Y to ∆conversion can be stated as follows: The resistance of any side of the ∆network
is equal to the sum of the Y network resistances multiplied two at a time, divided by the resistance
of the opposite branch of the Y network.
As an aid in using Eqs. (9-1)–(9-6) the following scheme is useful. Place the Y inside the ∆(Fig. 9-3). Note
that the ∆has three closed sides, while the Y has three open arms. Also note how each resistor in the open has
two adjacent resistors in the closed sides. For Ra, adjacent resistors are R1 and R3; for Rb, adjacent resistors
are R1 and R2; and for Rc, adjacent resistors are R2 and R3. Furthermore, each resistor can be considered
opposite to each other in the two networks. For example, open arm Rc is opposite to closed side R1; Rb is
opposite to R3; and Ra is opposite to R2.
Example 9.1
A ∆network is shown in Fig. 9-4a. Find the resistances of an equivalent Y network (Fig. 9-4b) and draw

Example 9.3
Use network conversion to ﬁnd the equivalent or total resistance RT between a and d in a bridge circuit
consisting of two deltas (Fig. 9-5a).

12 = 12
12 = 1 
Step 2.
Replace the ∆with its Y equivalent (Fig. 9-5c) in the original bridge circuit.
Step 3.
Simplify the series–parallel circuit. First, combine series resistances. Resistances Rc and R4 are in series, and
Rb and R5 are in series [Fig. 9-5d(1)].
Rc + R4 = 1 + 5 = 6 
Rb + R5 = 2 + 4 = 6 
Next combine the parallel branches, Rc + R4 and Rb + R5. Since the resistances are equal [Fig. 9-5d(2)],
Rp = 6
2 = 3 
Finally, combine series resistances Ra and Rp [Fig. 9-5d(3)].
RT = Ra + Rp = 0.667 + 3 = 3.67 

Reducing a bridge circuit by ∆to Y conversion
SUPERPOSITION
The superposition theorem states that in a network with two or more sources the current or voltage for any
component is the algebraic sum of the effects produced by each source acting independently. In order to use
one source at a time, all other sources are removed from the circuit. A voltage source is removed by replacing
it with a short circuit. A current source is removed by replacing it with an open circuit.
In order to superimpose currents and voltages, all the components must be linear and bilateral. Linear
means that the current is proportional to the applied voltage; that is, the current and voltage obey Ohm’s
law, I = V/R. Then the currents calculated for different source voltages can be superimposed, that is, added

algebraically. Bilateral means that the current is the same amount for opposite polarities of the source voltage.
Then the values for opposite directions of current can be added algebraically.

Step 1.
Find the currents produced by voltage source V1 only.
(a)
Replace voltage source V2 with a short circuit (Fig. 9-6b). Use the subscript V1 after a comma to indicate
that only source V1 is supplying the circuit. For example, I1,V 1 is current I1 due only to source V1 and
I2,V 1 is current I2 due only to source V1.
(b)
Combine series and parallel resistances to reduce the circuit to a single source and a single resistance
(Fig. 9-6c). Solve for currents produced by V1.
R4 = R1 +
R2R3
R2 + R3
= 1 + 1(1)
1 + 1 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 
I1,V 1 = V1
R4
= 3
1.5 = 2 A
I1,V 1 will divide symmetrically at point a because of equal resistances R2 and R3 (Fig. 9-6b) so that
I2,V 1 = −1
2I1,V 1 = −1
22 = −1 A
I3,V 1 = 1
2I1,V 1 = 1
22 = 1 A
The negative sign is used to show that I2,V 1 actually leaves point a rather than enters point a as assumed.
Step 2.
Find the currents produced by voltage source V2 only.
(a)
Replace voltage source V1 with a short circuit (Fig. 9-6d). Use a subscript V2 after a comma to indicate
that only source V2 is supplying the circuit. For example, I1,V 2 is current I1 due only to source V2.
(b)
Reduce the circuit to a single source and a single resistance (Fig. 9-6e). Solve for currents produced by V2.
R5 = R2 +
R1R3
R2 + R3
= 1 + 1(1)
1 + 1 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 
I2,V 2 = V2
R5
= 4.5
1.5 = 3 A
I2,V 2 will divide symmetrically at point a (Fig. 9-6d) so that
I3,V 2 = 1
2I2,V 2 = 1
23 = 1.5 A
I1,V 2 = −1
2I2,V 2 = −1
23 = −1.5 A
The negative sign shows that I1,V 2 actually leaves point a and does not enter point a as assumed.
Step 3.
Add algebraically the individual currents to ﬁnd the currents produced by both V1 and V2 (Fig. 9-6f and g).
I1 = I1,V 1 + I1,V 2 = 2 −1.5 = 0.5 A
Ans.
I2 = I2,V 1 + I2,V 2 = −1 + 3 = 2 A

THEVENIN’S THEOREM
Thevenin’s theorem is a method used to change a complex circuit into a simple equivalent circuit.
Thevenin’s theorem states that any linear network of voltage sources and resistances, if viewed from any two

 
160

points in the network, can be replaced by an equivalent resistance RTh in series with an equivalent source VTh.
Figure 9-7a shows the original linear network with terminals a and b; Fig. 9-7b shows its connection to an
external network or load; and Fig. 9-7c shows the Thevenin equivalent VTh and RTh that can be substituted
for the linear network at the terminals a and b. The polarity of VTh is such that it will produce current from
a and b in the same direction as in the original network. RTh is the Thevenin resistance across the network
terminals a and b with each internal voltage source short-circuited. VTh is the Thevenin voltage that would
appear across the terminals a and b with the voltage sources in place and no load connected across a and b.
For this reason, VTh is also called the open-circuit voltage.

CHAP. 9]

Step 2.
Find VTh. VTh is the voltage across terminals a and b, which is the same as the voltage drop across resistance R2.
I =
V
R1 + R2
=
10
4 + 6 = 10
10 = 1 A
VTh = V2 = IR2
Then
VTh = 1(6) = 6 V
Ans.
The Thevenin equivalent is then as in Fig. 9-8c.
Example 9.6
To the circuit in Fig. 9-8a add a resistor load RL of 3.6  and ﬁnd the current IL through the load
voltage VL across the load.
The new circuit is as shown in Fig. 9-9a and with the Thevenin equivalent is as shown in Fig. 9-9b.

IL =

RTh + RL

2.4 + 3.6 = 6
6 = 1 A
Ans.
VL = ILRL = 1(3.6) = 3.6 V
Ans.
Note how the Thevenin equivalent has simpliﬁed the solution of the given two-mesh network. Further, if the load RL were
changed, we would not have to recalculate the entire network.
NORTON’S THEOREM
Norton’s theorem is used to simplify a network in terms of currents instead of voltages. For current analysis,
this theorem can be used to reduce a network to a simple parallel circuit with a current source, which supplies
a total line current that can be divided among parallel branches.
If the current I (Fig. 9-10) is a 4-A source, it supplies 4 A no matter what is connected across the output
terminals a and b. With nothing connected across a and b, all the 4 A ﬂows through shunt R. When a load
resistance RL is connected across a and b, then the 4-A current divides according to the current-division rule
for parallel branches.
The symbol for a current source is a circle with an arrow inside (Fig. 9-10) to show the direction of current.
This direction must be the same as the current produced by the polarity of the corresponding voltage source.
Remember that a source produces current ﬂow out from the positive terminal.
Norton’s theorem states that any network connected to terminals a and b [Fig. 9-11a(1)] can be replaced by
a single current source IN in parallel with a single resistance RN [Fig. 9-11a(2)]. IN is equal to the short-circuit
current through the ab terminals (the current that the network would produce through a and b with a short

circuit across these two terminsals). RN is the resistance at terminals a and b, looking back from the open ab
terminals. The value of the single resistor is the same for both the Norton and Thevenin equivalent circuits.
Example 9.7
Calculate the current IL (see Fig. 9-9a) by Norton’s theorem. (This was solved in Example 9.6 by
Thevenin’s theorem.)
Step 1.
Find IN. Short-circuit across ab terminals (Fig. 9-11b). A short circuit across ab short-circuits RL and the parallel
R2. Then the only resistance in the circuit is R1 in series with source V .
IN = V
R1
= 10
4 = 2.5 A
Step 2.
Find RN. Open terminals ab and short-circuit V (Fig. 9-11c). R1 and R2 are in parallel, so
RN = 4(6)
4 + 6 = 24
10 = 2.4 
Note that RN is the same as RTh.

 
CHAP. 9]
NETWORK CALCULATIONS
163
Fig. 9-11c, d, e
The Norton equivalent is then as in Fig. 9-11d. The arrow on the current source shows the direction of conventional
current from terminal a to terminal b, as in the original circuit.
Step 3.
Find IL. Reconnect RL to ab terminals (Fig. 9-11e). The current source still delivers 2.5 A, but now the current
divides between the two branches RN and RL.
IL =
RN
RN + RL
IN =
2.4
2.4 + 3.6 2.5 = 2.4
6 2.5 = 1 A
Ans.
This value is the same load current calculated in Example 9.6. Also, VL can be calculated as ILRL, or
(1 A)(3.6 ) = 3.6 V.
We therefore see that the Thevenin equivalent circuit (Fig. 9-12a) corresponds to the Norton equivalent
circuit (Fig. 9-12b). So a general voltage source with a series resistance (Fig. 9-12a) can be converted to an
equivalent current source with the same resistance in parallel (Fig. 9-12b). Divide the general source V by its
series resistance R to ﬁnd the value of I for the equivalent current source shunted by the same resistance R;
that is, IN = VTh/RTh.

SERIES–PARALLEL CIRCUITS
Many circuits consist of a combination of series and parallel circuits. These combination circuits are
called series–parallel circuits. An example of a series–parallel circuit is shown in Fig. 9-13, where two parallel
resistors R2 and R3 are connected in series with the resistor R1 and the voltage source V . In a circuit of this
type, the current IT divides after it ﬂows through R1, and part ﬂows through R2 and part ﬂows through R3.
Then the current joins at the junction of the two resistors and ﬂows back to the negative terminal of the voltage
source and through the voltage source to the positive terminal.
Fig. 9-13
A series–parallel circuit
In solving for values of current, voltage, and resistance in a series–parallel circuit, follow the rules that
apply to a series circuit for the series part of the circuit, and follow the rules that apply to a parallel circuit for
the parallel part of the circuit. Solving series–parallel circuits is simpliﬁed if all parallel and series groups are
ﬁrst reduced to single equivalent resistances and the circuits redrawn in simpliﬁed form. The redrawn circuit
is called an equivalent circuit.
There are no general formulas for the solution of series–parallel circuits because there are so many different
forms of these circuits.

WHEATSTONE BRIDGE CIRCUIT
The wheatstone bridge (Fig. 9-16) can be used to measure an unknown resistance Rx. Switch S2 applies
battery voltage to the four resistors in the bridge. To balance the bridge, the value of R3 is varied. Balance is
indicated by zero current in galvanometer G when switch S1 is closed.

The ratio arm of the bridge is R1/R2. A rotary switching arrangement is used often in commercial bridges
to adjust the ratio arm over a wide range of ratios. The bridge is balanced by varying R3 for zero current in the
meter. A decade box, where resistance can be varied in small ohmic steps up to as high as 10 K, is commonly
used as R3. The value of Rx can be read directly from the calibrated scale of the rheostat when R3 is adjusted
for balance.
When current ﬂows through the meter path bc, the bridge circuit is unbalanced and must be analyzed by
Kirchhoff’s laws or network theorems.
Example 9.10
An unknown resistance is to be measured by the Wheatstone bridge. If the ratio of R1/R2 is 1/100 and

MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER
The maximum power is supplied by the voltage source and received by the load resistor if the value of
the resistor equals the value of the internal resistance of the voltage source (Fig. 9-17). For maximum power
transfer, then

LINE-DROP CALCULATIONS
The connecting wires are generally very short in electric circuits. Because the resistance of these short
lengths is low, it was neglected in previous calculations. However, in home and factory electrical installations,
where long lines of wires or feeders are used, the resistance of these long lengths must be included in all
calculations.
The voltage drop across the resistance of the line wires is called the line drop. For example, if a generator
delivers 120 V but the voltage available at a motor some distance away is only 117 V, then there has been a
line drop in voltage of 3 V.
We must be careful about specifying the kind and size of wires used in any installation. If the wires are
incorrectly chosen, then the line drop may be too large so that the voltage available to an electrical apparatus
will be too low for proper operation (refer to the section on wire measurement in Chapter 4).
Example 9.13
A lamp bank consisting of three lamps, each drawing 1.5 A, is connected to a 120-V source (Fig. 9-19).
Each line wire has a resistance of 0.25 . Find the line drop, line power loss, and voltage available at the load.

THREE-WIRE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
The basic circuit described so far has been a two-wire circuit to a lamp, motor, or other load device. The
basic two-wire circuit uses 120 V to supply the many household and factory load devices designed for that
voltage. The three-wire circuit was developed to reduce the problems of voltage drop and power loss in the
lines while still providing 120-V supply. The three wires of Fig. 9-21, including the grounded neutral, can
be used for either 240 or 120 V. From either red or black high side to neutral, 120 V is available for separate
branch circuits to the lights and outlets. Across the red and black wires, 240 V is available for high-power
appliances such as a freezer or automatic clothes dryer. This 120/240-V three-wire distribution with a grounded
neutral is called the Edison system.
Fig. 9-21
Three-wire distribution system
Fig. 9-22
Three-wire system with two voltage sources
The Edison System with Two Voltage Sources
This system (Fig. 9-22) has two direct-current generators, GA and GB, with load voltages VL1 and VL2.
R1, R2, and R3 are the resistances of the line wires between the generators and the load. RL1 and RL2 are the
load resistances. I1, I2, and I3 are the currents in the line wires.
I1 and I3 will always ﬂow in the direction indicated. I2 may ﬂow in either direction. The actual direction
of ﬂow will be determined by the sign of I2. A + sign for I2 means that it actually ﬂows in the direction
indicated, while a −sign means I2 ﬂows in the reverse direction.
By KCL and KVL, we can write
I3 = I1 −I2

VB + I2R2 −I3RL2 −I3R3 = 0
(3)
If the three wires are equal in size, as they usually are, their resistances are equal. So R = R1 = R2 = R3.
Equations (1), (2), and (3) can be solved to ﬁnd the line currents.

172
NETWORK CALCULATIONS
[CHAP. 9
Note that because I3 has the higher current, the heavier load is connected between the negative (lower) line and
the neutral, and the neutral carries current away from the generator. If the 120-V loads were balanced on each
side of the neutral (RL1 = RL2), the neutral would carry no current (I2 = 0).
Step 2.

Assume that the fuse in the neutral line is blown, opening the neutral line in Fig. 9-23. What now are
the voltages across the two loads?

I =

0.5 + 10 + 5 + 0.5 = 240
16 = 15 A
VL1 = IRL1 = 15(10) = 150 V
Ans.
VL2 = IRL2 = 15(5) = 75 V
Ans.
The high voltage of 150 V across the 10- load resistor could destroy the equipment connected at that point in the
circuit. If the load were lights, the light bulbs would burn out fairly quickly with a 31-V overage (150 −119 = 31). For
this reason, the neutral wire must not contain a fuse for protection of the circuit. Generally, electrical codes forbid fuses in
the neutral line.

I =

0.5 + 10 + 0.5 = 120
11 = 10.9 A
Vl2 = 9.1(0.5) = 4.55 V
Total line drop = Vl1 + Vl2 = 5.95 + 4.55

Total line drop = 10.9(1) = 10.9 V
VL1 = 11.9(10) = 119 V
VL1 = 10.9(10) = 109 V
Then,
Difference in line drop = 10.9 −10.5 = 0.4 V
Ans.
Difference in load voltage = 119 −109 = 10 V

magnetism.
Natural Magnets
The phenomenon of magnetism was discovered by the Chinese about 2637 b.c. The magnets used in their
primitive compasses were called lodestones or leading stones. It is now known that lodestones were crude
pieces of iron ore known as magnetite. Since magnetite has magnetic properties in its natural state, lodestones
are classiﬁed as natural magnets. The only other natural magnet is the earth itself. All other magnets are
human-made and are known as artiﬁcial magnets.
Magnetic Fields
Every magnet has two points opposite to each other which most readily attract pieces of iron. These points
are called poles of the magnet: the north pole and the south pole. Just as like electric charges repel each other
and opposite charges attract each other, like magnetic poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other.
A magnet clearly attracts a bit of iron because of some force that exists around the magnet. This force is
called the magnetic ﬁeld. Although it is invisible to the naked eye, its force can be shown to exist by sprinkling
small iron ﬁlings on a sheet of glass or paper over a bar magnet (Fig. 10-1a). If the sheet is tapped gently, the
ﬁlings will move into a deﬁnite pattern which describes the ﬁeld of force around the magnet. The ﬁeld seems
to be made up of lines of force that appear to leave the magnet at the north pole, travel through the air around
the magnet, and continue through the magnet to the south pole to form a closed loop of force. The stronger
the magnet, the greater the number of lines of force and the larger the area covered by the ﬁeld.
In order to visualize the magnetic ﬁeld without iron ﬁlings, the ﬁeld is shown as lines of force in Fig. 10-1b.
The direction of the lines outside the magnet shows the path a north pole would follow in the ﬁeld, repelled
away from the north pole of the magnet and attracted to its south pole.
Fig. 10-1
Magnetic ﬁeld of force around a bar magnet
Magnetic Flux φ
The entire group of magnetic ﬁeld lines, which ﬂow outward from the north pole of the magnet, is called
the magnetic ﬂux. The symbol for magnetic ﬂux is the Greek lowercase letter φ (phi).

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
[CHAP. 10
The SI unit of magnetic ﬂux is the weber (Wb). One weber equals 1 × 108 magnetic ﬁeld lines. Since the
weber is a large unit for typical ﬁelds, the microweber (µWb) is used (1 µWb = 10−6 Wb).
Example 10.1
If a magnetic ﬂux φ has 3000 lines, ﬁnd the number of microwebers.
Convert number of lines to microwebers.
φ =
3000 lines
1 × 108 lines/Wb = 3 × 103
108
= 30 × 10−6 Wb = 30 µWb
Ans.
Magnetic Flux Density B
The magnetic ﬂux density is the magnetic ﬂux per unit area of a section perpendicular to the direction of
ﬂux. The equation for magnetic ﬂux density is
B = φ
A
(10-1)
where
B = magnetic ﬂux density in teslas (T)
φ = magnetic ﬂux, Wb
A = area in square meters (m2)
We see that the SI unit for B is webers per square meter (Wb/m2). One weber per square meter is called a tesla.
Example 10.2
What is the ﬂux density in teslas when there exists a ﬂux of 600 µWb through an area of 0.0003 m2?
Given
φ = 600 µWb = 6 × 10−4 Wb
A = 0.0003 m2 = 3 × 10−4 m2
Substitute the values of φ and A in Eq. (10-1).
B = φ
A = 6 × 10−4 Wb
3 × 10−4 m2 = 2 T
Ans.
MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Magnetic materials are those materials which are attracted or repelled by a magnet and which can be
magnetized themselves. Iron and steel are the most common magnetic materials. Permanent magnets are those
of hard magnetic materials, such as cobalt steel, that retain their magnetism when the magnetizing ﬁeld is
removed. A temporary magnet is one that has no ability to retain a magnetized state when the magnetizing
ﬁeld is removed.
Permeability refers to the ability of a magnetic material to concentrate magnetic ﬂux. Any material that
is easily magnetized has high permeability. A measure of permeability for different materials in comparison
with air or vacuum is called relative permeability. The symbol for relative permeability is µr(mu), where the
subscript r stands for relative. µr is not expressed in units because it is a ratio of two ﬂux densities, so the
units cancel.
Classifying magnetic materials as either magnetic or nonmagnetic is based on the strong magnetic prop-
erties of iron. However, since weak magnetic materials can be important in some applications, classiﬁcation
includes three groups:
1.
Ferromagnetic materials. These include iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, and commercial alloys such as
alnico and Permalloy. The ferrites are nonmagnetic materials that have ferromagnetic properties

 
CHAP. 10]

of iron. A ferrite is a ceramic material. The permeability of ferrites is in the range of 50–3000.
A common application is a ferrite core in the coils for RF (radio-frequency) transformers.
2.
Paramagnetic materials. These include aluminum, platinum, manganese, and chromium. Relative
permeability is slightly more than 1.
3.
Diamagnetic materials. These include bismuth, antimony, copper, zinc, mercury, gold, and silver.
Relative permeability is less than 1.
ELECTROMAGNETISM
In 1819, a Danish scientist named Oersted discovered a relation between magnetism and electric current.
He found that an electric current ﬂowing through a conductor produced a magnetic ﬁeld around that conductor.
In Fig. 10-2a, ﬁlings in a deﬁnite pattern of concentric rings around the conductor show the magnetic ﬁeld of
the current in the wire. Every section of the wire has this ﬁeld of force around it in a plane perpendicular to
the wire (Fig. 10-2b). The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld around a conductor carrying current depends on the
current. A high current will produce many lines of force extending far from the wire, while a low current will
produce only a few lines close to the wire (Fig. 10-3).
Fig. 10-2
Circular pattern of magnetic lines around current in a conductor
Fig. 10-3
Strength of the magnetic ﬁeld depends on the amount of current
Polarity of a Single Conductor
The right-hand rule is a convenient way to determine the relationship between the ﬂow of current in a
conductor (wire) and the direction of the magnetic lines of force around the conductor. Grasp the current-
carrying wire in the right hand, wrapping the four ﬁngers around the wire and extending the thumb along
the wire. If the thumb points along the wire in the direction of current ﬂow, the ﬁngers will be pointing in the
direction of the lines of force around the conductor (Fig. 10-4).

Magnetic Fields Aiding or Canceling
In Fig. 10-5, the magnetic ﬁelds are shown for two parallel conductors with opposite directions of current.
The cross in the middle of the ﬁeld of the conductor in Fig. 10-5a symbolizes the back of an arrow to
indicate current into the paper. (Think of it as the feathers at the end of an arrow moving away from you.)
The dot (Fig. 10-5b) symbolizes current moving out of the paper. (In this case, it is a point of the arrow
facing toward you.) By applying the right-hand rule, you determine the clockwise direction of the ﬁeld of
the conductor in Fig. 10-5a and the counterclockwise ﬁeld direction of the conductor in Fig. 10-5b. Because
the magnetic lines between the conductors are in the same direction, the ﬁelds aid to make a stronger total
ﬁeld. On either side of the conductors, the two ﬁelds are opposite in direction and tend to cancel each
other.
Fig. 10-5
Fields aiding with opposite directions of current
Magnetic Field and Polarity of a Coil
Bending a straight conductor into the form of a single loop has two results. First the magnetic ﬁeld lines
are more dense inside the loop, although the total number of lines is the same as for the straight conductor.
Second, all the lines inside the loop are aiding in the same direction.

A coil of wire conductor is formed when there is more than one loop or turn. To determine the mag-
netic polarity of a coil, use the right-hand rule (Fig. 10-6). If the coil is grasped with the ﬁngers of the
right hand curled in the direction of current ﬂow through the coil, the thumb points to the north pole of
the coil.
Adding an iron core inside the coil increases the ﬂux density. The polarity of the core is the same as that
of the coil. The polarity depends on the direction of current ﬂow and the direction of winding. Current ﬂow is
from the positive side of the voltage source, through the coil, and back to the negative terminal (Fig. 10-7).
The north pole is found by using the right-hand rule.

The correct polarities are circled. Notice that A has the same direction of winding and current as in Fig. 10-7. In B,
the battery polarity is opposite from A to reverse the direction of current. In C, the direction of winding is reversed from
A; and in D, it is reversed from B.

Electromagnet Applications
If a bar of iron or soft steel is placed in the magnetic ﬁeld of a coil (Fig. 10-9), the bar will become
magnetized. If the magnetic ﬁeld is strong enough, the bar will be drawn into the coil until it is approximately
centered within the magnetic ﬁeld.
Electromagnets are widely used in electrical devices. One of the simplest and most common applications
is in a relay. When the switch S is closed in a relay circuit (Fig. 10-10), current ﬂows in the coil, causing a
strong magnetic ﬁeld around the coil. The soft iron bar in the lamp circuit is attracted toward the right end
of the electromagnet and makes contact with the conductor at A. A path is thus completed for current in the
lamp circuit. When the switch is opened, the current ﬂow through the electromagnet ceases and the magnetic
ﬁeld collapses and disappears. Since the attraction for the soft iron bar by the electromagnet no longer exists,

MAGNETIC UNITS
Ampere-Turns NI
The strength of a magnetic ﬁeld in a coil of wire depends on how much current ﬂows in the turns of the
coil. The more the current, the stronger the magnetic ﬁeld. Also, the more turns, the more concentrated are
the lines of force. The product of the current times the number of turns of the coil, which is expressed in units
called ampere-turns (At), is known as the magnetomotive force (mmf). As a formula,
F = ampere-turns = NI
(10-2)
where
F = magnetomotive force, At
N = number of turns
I = current, A
Example 10.4
Calculate the ampere-turns for a coil with 1500 turns and a 4-mA current.
Use Eq. (10-2) and substitute
N = 150 turns
and
I = 4 × 10−3 A.
NI = 1500(4 × 10−3) = 6 At
Ans.

Field Intensity H
If a coil with a certain number of ampere-turns is stretched out to twice its original length, the intensity
of the magnetic ﬁeld, that is, the concentration of lines of force, will be half as great. The ﬁeld intensity thus
depends on how long the coil is. Expressed as an equation,
H = NI
l
(10-3)
where
H = magnetic ﬁeld intensity, ampere-turns per meter (At/m)
NI = ampere-turns, At
l = length between poles of the coil, m
Equation (10-3) is for a solenoid. H is the intensity at the center of an air core. With an iron core, H is the
intensity through the entire core and l is length or distance between poles of the iron core.
Example 10.5
(a) Find the ﬁeld intensity of a 40-turn, 10-cm-long coil, with 3 A ﬂowing in it (Fig. 10-11a). (b) If
the same coil is stretched to 20 cm, with the wire length and current remaining the same, what is the new value of ﬁeld
intensity (Fig. 10-11b)? (c) The 10 cm coil in part (a) with the same 3 A ﬂowing is now wound around an iron core that
is 20 cm long (Fig. 10-11c). What is the ﬁeld intensity?

H = NI
l

0.1
= 1200 At/m
Ans.
(b)
The length l in Eq. (10-3) is between poles. The coil is stretched from 10 to 20 cm. Though the wire length is
the same, the length between poles is 20 cm = 0.2 m. So
H = 40(3)
0.2
= 600 At/m
Ans.
Stretching out the coil to twice its original distance reduces the mmf by one-half.
(c)
The length l in Eq. (10-3) is 20 cm between the poles at the ends of the iron core although the winding is 10 cm
long.
H = 40(3)

= 600 At/m
Ans.
Note that cases (b) and (c) have the same H value.

BH MAGNETIZATION CURVE
The BH curve (Fig. 10-12) is used to show how much ﬂux density B results from increasing the amount
of ﬁeld intensity H. This curve is for two types of soft iron plotted for typical values. It shows that soft iron
number 1 increases rapidly in B with an increase in H before it develops a “knee” and becomes saturated at
H = 2000 At/m, B = 0.2 T. Past the knee an increase in H has little effect on the B value. Soft iron number
2 needs much more H to reach its saturation level at H = 5000 At/m, B = 0.3 T. Similar curves are obtained
for all magnetic materials. Air, being nonmagnetic, has a very low BH proﬁle (Fig. 10-12).
The permeability µ of a magnetic material is the ratio of B to H.
µ = B
H
(10-4)
Its average value is measured at the point where the knee is ﬁrst established. Figure 10-12 illustrates that the
normal or average permeability is as follows:
µ for soft iron number 1 = B
H = 0.2
2000 = 1 × 10−4 (T · m)/At
µ for soft iron number 2 = B
H = 0.3
5000 = 6 × 10−5 (T · m)/At

Typical BH curve for two types of soft iron
In SI units, the permeability of air is µ0 = 4π × 10−7 or 1.26 × 10−6. To calculate µ, the value of relative
permeability µr must be multiplied by µ0.
µ = µr × µ0

Hysteresis
When the current in a coil of wire reverses thousands of times per second, the hysteresis can cause a
considerable loss of energy. Hysteresis means “a lagging behind”; that is, the magnetic ﬂux in an iron core
lags behind the increases or decreases of the magnetizing force.
The hysteresis loop is a series of curves that show the characteristics of a magnetic material (Fig. 10-13).
Opposite directions of current result in the opposite directions of +H and −H for ﬁeld intensity. Similarly,
opposite polarities are shown for ﬂux density as +B or −B. The current starts at the center 0 (zero) when the
material is unmagnetized. The dotted line is recognized as the magnetization curve illustrated in Fig. 10-12.
Positive H values increase B to saturation at +Bmax. Next H decreases to zero, but B drops to the value
of Br because of hysteresis. The current that produced the original magnetization now is reversed so that
H becomes negative. B drops to zero and continues to −Bmax. Then as the −H values decrease, B is reduced
to −Br, when H is zero. Now with a positive swing of current, H becomes positive, producing saturation at
+Bmax again. The hysteresis loop is now completed. The curve does not return to zero at the center because
of hysteresis.
The value of +Br or −Br, which is the ﬂux density remaining after the magnetizing force is zero (H = 0),
is called the retentivity of a magnetic material. The value of −Hc, which is the magnetizing force that must
be applied in the reverse direction to reduce the ﬂux density to zero (B = 0), is called the coercive force of
the material.
The larger the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop, the greater the hysteresis loss.

MAGNETIC CIRCUITS
A magnetic circuit can be compared with an electric current in which an emf produces a current ﬂow.
Consider a simple magnetic circuit (Fig. 10-14). The ampere-turns NI of the magnetomotive force produce
the magnetic ﬂux φ. Therefore, the mmf compares to emf or voltage and the ﬂux φ compares to current.
Opposition to the production of ﬂux in a material is called its reluctance, which corresponds to resistance.
Reluctance 
The symbol for reluctance is . Reluctance is inversely proportional to permeability. Iron has high
permeability and therefore low reluctance. Air has low permeability and hence high reluctance.

Fig. 10-15
Different physical forms of electromagnets
Different forms of electromagnets generally have different values of reluctance (Fig. 10-15). The air gap
is the air space between the poles of a magnet. Since air has high reluctance, the size of the air gap affects
the value of reluctance. The magnetic circuit in Fig. 10-15a has widely spaced poles in air so it has a high
reluctance. In Fig. 10-15b, the reluctance has been decreased by bringing the two poles closer together. The ﬁeld
between N and S is more intense, assuming the same number of ampere-turns in the coils. In Fig. 10-15c, the
air gap is smaller than that in Fig. 10-15b so the reluctance is lower. In Fig. 10-15d, there is no air gap in the
toroid-shaped core so its reluctance is very low.
The shorter the air gap, the stronger the ﬁeld in the gap. Since air is not magnetic and thus is unable to
concentrate magnetic lines, a larger air gap only provides more space for the magnetic lines to spread out.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction. It states that if a conductor
“cuts across” lines of magnetic force, or if lines of force cut across a conductor, an emf, or voltage, is induced
across the ends of the conductor. Consider a magnet with its lines of force extending from the north to the south
pole (Fig. 10-16). Aconductor C, which can be moved between the poles, is connected to a galvanometer G used
to indicate the presence of an emf. When the conductor is not moving, the galvanometer shows zero emf. If the
wire conductor is moving outside the magnetic ﬁeld at position 1, the galvanometer will still show zero. When
the conductor is moved to the left to position 2, it cuts across the lines of magnetic force and the galvanometer
pointer will deﬂect to A. This indicates that an emf was induced in the conductor because lines of force were
cut. In position 3, the galvanometer pointer swings back to zero because no lines of force are being cut. Now
reverse the direction of the conductor by moving it right through the lines of force back to position 1. During
this movement, the pointer will deﬂect to B, showing that an emf has again been induced in the wire, but in the
opposite direction. If the wire is held stationary in the middle of the ﬁeld of force at position 2, the galvanometer
reads zero. If the conductor is moved up or down parallel to the lines of force so that none is cut, no emf will be
induced.

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
[CHAP. 10
Fig. 10-16
When a conductor cuts lines of force, an emf is induced in the conductor
In summary,
1.
When lines of force are cut by a conductor or lines of force cut a conductor, an emf or voltage,
is induced in the conductor.
2.
There must be relative motion between the conductor and the lines of force in order to induce an emf.
3.
Changing the direction of cutting will change the direction of the induced emf.
The most important application of relative motion between conductor and magnetic ﬁeld is made in electric
generators. In a dc generator, ﬁxed electromagnets are arranged in a cylindrical housing. Many conductors
in the form of a coil are rotated on a core within the magnetic ﬁeld so that these conductors are continually
cutting the lines of force. As a result, voltage is induced in each of the conductors. Since the conductors are in
series in the coil, the induced voltages add together to produce the output voltage of the generator.
Faraday’s Law of Induced Voltage
The value of the induced voltage depends upon the number of turns of a coil and how fast the conductor
cuts across the lines of force or ﬂux. Either the conductor or the ﬂux can move. The equation to calculate the
value of the induced voltage is
vind = N φ
t
(10-8)
where
vind = induced voltage, V
N = number of turns in a coil
φ/t = rate at which the ﬂux cuts across the conductor, Wb/s
From Eq. (10-8) we see that υind is determined by three factors:
1.
Amount of ﬂux. The more the lines of force that cut across the conductor, the higher the value of
induced voltage.
2.
Number of turns. The more the turns in a coil, the higher the induced voltage.
3.
Time rate of cutting. The faster the ﬂux cuts a conductor or the conductor cuts the ﬂux, the higher the
induced voltage because more lines of force cut the conductor within a given period of time.
Example 10.9
The ﬂux of an electromagnet is 6 Wb. The ﬂux increases uniformly to 12 Wb in a period of 2 s. Calculate
the voltage induced in a coil that has 10 turns if the coil is stationary in the magnetic ﬁeld.

Write down known values.
φ = change in ﬂux = 12 Wb −6 Wb = 6 Wb
t = change in time corresponding to the increase in ﬂux = 2 s
Then
φ
t = 6
2 = 3 Wb/s
We are given that N = 10 turns. Substitute values into Eq. (10-8) and solve for υind.
vind = N φ
t = 10(3) = 30 V
Ans.
Example 10.10
In Example 10-9, what is the value of induced voltage if the ﬂux remains at 6 Wb after 2 s?
Since there is no change in ﬂux, φ = 0. Using Eq. (10-8),
vind = N φ
t = N 0
t = N0 = 0 V
Ans.
That no voltage is induced in Example 10.10 conﬁrms the principle that there must be relative motion
between the conductor and the ﬂux in order to induce a voltage. A magnetic ﬁeld whose ﬂux is increasing or
decreasing in strength is, in effect, moving relative to any conductors in the ﬁeld.
Lenz’s Law
The polarity of the induced voltage is determined by Lenz’s law. The induced voltage has the polarity that
opposes the change causing the induction. When a current ﬂows as a result of an induced voltage, this current
sets up a magnetic ﬁeld about the conductor such that this conductor magnetic ﬁeld reacts with the external
magnetic ﬁeld, producing the induced voltage to oppose the change in the external magnetic ﬁeld. If the
external ﬁeld increases, the conductor magnetic ﬁeld of the induced current will be in the opposite direction.
If the external ﬁeld decreases, the conductor magnetic ﬁeld will be in the same direction, thus sustaining the
external ﬁeld.
Example 10.11
A permanent magnet is moved into a coil and causes an induced current to ﬂow in the coil circuit
(Fig. 10-17a). Determine the polarity of the coil and the direction of the induced current.
By use of Lenz’s law, the left end of the coil must be the N pole to oppose the motion of the magnet. Then the
direction of the induced current can be determined by the right-hand rule. If the right thumb points to the left for the N
pole, the ﬁngers coil around the direction of current (Fig. 10-17b).

of force emanating from the N poles have the same direction and thus repel each other. This force
of repulsion tends to move the two magnets apart. On the other hand, if the N and the S poles of
two magnets are placed near each other (Fig. 10-18b), the adjacent lines of force are opposite in

direction and they link together to form long loops. These long, continuous lines tend to contract and
this force of attraction pulls the two magnets together. So ﬁelds from like poles repel, tending to push
the magnets apart, while ﬁelds from unlike poles attract, tending to pull the magnets together.

An example of magnetic attraction is the navigator’s compass and the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The earth
itself is a huge natural magnet. The earth has its magnetic south (S) pole near the geographic north
(N) pole, and its magnetic north (N) pole near the geographic south (S) pole. The compass needle is
a long, thin permanent magnet that is free to move on its central bearing point. The compass needle
always lines up its magnetic ﬁeld with the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth, with its north end pointing
toward the earth’s magnetic south pole. The geographic N pole is located near the magnetic S pole.
Show how a magnetic compass is used to indicate direction.

Would 1 A ﬂowing through a 2-m length of wire made into a single loop produce more, the same, or
less mmf if it were wound into a coil 2 cm in diameter and 4 cm long?

MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
[CHAP. 10
Basically ﬂux is produced by current ﬂowing in a wire. The mmf produced is the product of the
current times the number of turns of the coil. Since 1 A is ﬂowing through a coil of 1 turn in both
cases, though the physical conﬁguration of the coils is different, the mmf is the same at 1 At.

(a)
Consider a coil with an air core (Fig. 10-20a). The coil is 5 cm long and has 8 turns. When the
switch is closed, a current of 5 A ﬂows in it. Find the mmf and H.
(b)
If an iron core were slipped into the coil (Fig. 10-20b), what is now the mmf and H? What
qualitative changes take place?

What changes is a large increase in ﬂux density B. Suppose the iron core in air produced 50 lines
of force. With the core placed into an energized coil, the number of lines in the core area might
be 250 000. In this case, iron would have a permeability 5000 times that of air. Therefore, the use
of an iron core instead of an air core increases the effectiveness of the magnet several thousand
times. For this reason most electromagnets are made with iron cores.
(c)
The lengthening of the iron core does not change the ampere-turns of the coil, so
mmf = 400 At
Ans.
However, with a longer iron that is twice the initial length (10 cm = 2×5 cm), the ﬁeld intensity
is reduced by half.

Hysteresis loops of three different magnetic materials are shown in Fig. 10-21. Rank them in order
from least to most hysteresis loss.
The smaller the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop, the lower the hysteresis loss. Hysteresis loss
is likened to magnetic friction that must be overcome in magnetizing a material. Curve B, having the
smallest area, has the least hysteresis loss. Loop B is characteristic of a temporary-magnet material.
The coercive force is very small and hysteresis loss would be negligible. Next in area size is loop A,
which is typical of a relatively permanent magnet material. And loop C with the largest area has the
highest loss. This rectangular-shaped curve typiﬁes permanent magnet material, such as alnico.

If the magnetic circuit of Problem 10.8 has an air gap of 0.2 cm in addition to the 20 cm of annealed

a B of 0.72 T? Assume that the area of the air gap is the same as the area of the steel core.
The total reluctance of the magnetic circuit, T , is the reluctance of the steel path plus the
reluctance of the air gap. The µ0 of air is 1.26 × 10−6 (T · m)/At. The reluctance  of the steel,

The total reluctance T is the sum of  and A.
T =  + A = 83 300 + 5 290 000 = 5 373 300 = 5.37 × 106 At/Wb

Explain the terms of the induced voltage formula.
The equation is
vind = N φ
t
(10-8)
N, the number of turns, is a constant. More turns will provide more induced voltage, while fewer
turns mean less voltage. Two factors are included in φ/t. Its value can be increased by a higher
value of φ or a smaller value of t. As an example, the value of 4 Wb/s for φ/t can be doubled
by either increasing φ to 8 Wb or reducing t to 1/2s. Then φ/t is 8/1 or 4/(1/2), which equals
8 Wb/s in either case. For the opposite case, φ/t can be reduced by a smaller value of φ or a
higher value of t.

Direct-Current Generators and Motors
MOTORS AND GENERATORS
A motor is a machine that converts electric energy into rotary mechanical energy. Motors turn washing
machines, dryers, fans, furnace blowers, and much of the machinery found in industry. A generator, on the
other hand, is a machine that converts rotary mechanical energy into electric energy. The mechanical energy
might be supplied by a waterfall, steam, wind, gasoline or diesel engine, or an electric motor.
Components
The main parts of direct-current motors and generators are basically the same (Fig. 11-1).
Fig. 11-1
Main parts of a dc motor. (From B. Grob,
Basic Electronics, McGraw-Hill, New York,
1977, 4th ed., p. 338)
Armature
In a motor, the armature receives current from an external electrical source. This causes the armature to
turn. In a generator, the armature is rotated by an external mechanical force. The voltage generated in the
armature is then connected to an external circuit. In brief, the motor armature receives current from an external
circuit (the power supply), and the generator armature delivers current to an external circuit (the load). Since
the armature rotates, it is also called a rotor.

230
DIRECT-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
[CHAP. 11
Commutator
A dc machine has a commutator to convert the alternating current ﬂowing in its armature into the direct
current at its terminals (in the case of the generator). The commutator (Fig. 11-1) consists of copper segments
with one pair of segments for each armature coil. Each commutator segment is insulated from the others by
mica. The segments are mounted around the armature shaft and are insulated from the shaft and armature iron.
Two stationary brushes are mounted on the frame of the machine so that they contact opposite segments of the
commutator.
Brushes
These graphite connectors are stationary and spring-mounted to slide or “brush” against the commutator
on the armature shaft. Thus, brushes provide a connection between the armature coils and the external load.
Field Winding
This electromagnet produces the ﬂux cut by the armature. In a motor, current for the ﬁeld is provided by
the same source that supplies the armature. In a generator, the ﬁeld-current source may come from a separate
source called an exciter or from its own armature output.
SIMPLE DC GENERATOR
A simple dc generator consists of an armature coil with a single turn of wire. This armature coil cuts
across the magnetic ﬁeld to produce voltage. If a complete path is present, current will move through the
circuit in the direction shown by the arrows (Fig. 11-2a). In this position of the coil, commutator segment 1
is in contact with brush 1, while commutator segment 2 is in contact with brush 2. As the armature rotates a
half turn in a clockwise direction, the contacts between the commutator segments and the brushes are reversed
(Fig. 11-2b). Now, segment 1 is in contact with brush 2 and segment 2 is in contact with brush 1. Because of
this commutator action, that side of the armature coil which is in contact with either of the brushes is always
cutting across the magnetic ﬁeld in the same direction. Therefore, brushes 1 and 2 have constant polarity, and
a pulsating direct current is delivered to the external load circuit.
Fig. 11-2
Basic operation of a dc generator
Example 11.1
A dc generator with a single coil produces a pulsating dc output. By using more coils and combining
their output, a smoother waveform can be obtained. Draw a voltage output waveform that results when a second coil is
added to the armature and placed perpendicular to the ﬁrst coil.

 
CHAP. 11]
DIRECT-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
231
See Fig. 11-3. Notice that a voltage is included at all times. Although the current still pulsates, the output is smoother.
In practical generators, many coils are wound around the armature to produce a still smoother dc output.
Fig. 11-3
Output of a two-coil dc generator
Fig. 11-4
Simplex lap winding
ARMATURE WINDINGS
The armature coils used in large dc machines are usually wound in their ﬁnal shape before being put on
the armature. The sides of the preformed coil are placed in the slots of the laminated armature core. There are
two ways the coils can be connected, lap winding and wave winding.
In a simplex lap winding, the ends of each coil are connected to adjacent commutator segments (Fig. 11-4).
In this way all the coils are connected in series. In a duplex lap winding there are in effect two separate sets
of coils, each set connected in series (Fig. 11-5). The two sets of coils are connected to each other only by the
brushes. Similarly, a triplex lap winding is in effect three separate sets of series-connected coils. In a simplex
lap winding, a single brush short-circuits the two ends of a single coil.
In a wave winding, the ends of each coil are connected to commutator segments two pole spans apart
(Fig. 11-6). Instead of short-circuiting a single coil, a brush will short-circuit a small group of coils in series.
The area in a generator where no voltage can be induced in an armature coil is called the commutating
or neutral plane. This plane is midway between adjacent north and south ﬁeld poles. The brushes are always
set so that they short-circuit the armature coils passing through the neutral plane while, at the same time, the
output is taken from the other coils.
Example 11.2
Explain the commutating action in a simplex lap–wound armature that has 22 coils.
See Fig. 11-7. An armature with 22 coils is connected to 22 commutator segments. There are two brushes. The
+ brush is short-circuiting armature coil 11, while the – brush is short-circuiting armature coil 22. There is no voltage
induced in either of these coils. The two coil groups, 1–10 and 12–21, are connected in parallel by the brushes because
the voltages in both coil groups have the same polarity. The brushes also connect the generated voltage to the external
load circuit. While the brush is short-circuiting one armature coil, it is receiving the voltage and current induced in the
other armature coils because one end of two different coils is connected to the same commutator segment (e.g., coil 21 and
coil 22).

FIELD EXCITATION
DC generators take their names from the type of ﬁeld excitation used. When the generator’s ﬁeld is supplied
or “excited” from a separate dc source, such as a battery, it is called a separately excited generator (Fig. 11-8).
When a generator supplies its own excitation, it is called a self-excited generator. If its ﬁeld is connected in
parallel with the armature circuit, it is called a shunt generator (Fig. 11-9a). When the ﬁeld is in series with
the armature, the generator is called a series generator (Fig. 11-9b). If both shunt and series ﬁelds are used, the
generator is called a compound generator. Compound generators may be connected short-shunt (Fig. 11-9c),
with the shunt ﬁeld in parallel only with the armature, or long-shunt (Fig. 11-9d), with the shunt ﬁeld in parallel
with both the armature and series ﬁeld. When the series ﬁeld is so connected that its ampere-turns act in the same
direction as those of the shunt ﬁeld, the generator is said to be a cumulative-compound generator. Field rheostats
are adjustable resistances placed in the ﬁeld circuits to vary the ﬁeld ﬂux and therefore the emf generated by the
generator.

A 100-kW, 250-V dc generator has an armature current of 400 A, armature resistance (including brushes)
of 0.025 , and series-ﬁeld resistance of 0.005 . It is driven at 1200 revolutions per minute (rpm) by a constant-
speed motor. Compute the armature generated voltage.

GENERATOR VOLTAGE EQUATIONS AND VOLTAGE REGULATION
The average generated voltage Vg of a generator may be calculated from the formula
Vg =
pZφn
60b × 108
(11-4)
where
Vg = average generated voltage of a dc generator, V
p = number of poles
Z = total number of conductors on armature (also called inductors)
φ = ﬂux per pole
n = speed of the armature, rpm
b = number of parallel paths through armature, depending on type of armature winding
For any generator, all factors in Eq. (11-4) are ﬁxed values except φ and n. Hence Eq. (11-4) may be
simpliﬁed to
Vg = kφn
(11-5)
where
k =
pZ
60b × 108
Equation (11-5) indicates that the value of an induced emf in any circuit is proportional to the rate at which
the ﬂux is being cut. Thus, if φ is doubled while n remains constant, Vg is doubled. Similarly, if n is doubled,
φ remaining constant, Vg will be doubled.
Example 11.5
When a generator is being driven at 1200 rpm, the generated voltage is 120 V. What will be the generated
voltage (a) if the ﬁeld ﬂux is decreased by 10 percent with the speed remaining ﬁxed and (b) if the speed is reduced to

Ans.
Voltage regulation is the difference between the no-load (NL) and full-load (FL) terminal voltage of a
generator and is expressed as a percentage of the full-load value.
Voltage regulation = NL voltage −FL voltage
FL voltage
(11-6)
Low-percentage regulation, characteristic of lighting circuits, means that the generator’s terminal voltage is
nearly the same at full load as it is at no load.

LOSSES AND EFFICIENCY OF A DC MACHINE
The losses of generators and motors consist of copper losses in the electric circuits and mechanical losses
due to the rotation of the machine. Losses include:
1.
Copper losses
(a)
Armature I 2R losses
(b)
Field losses
(1) Shunt ﬁeld I 2R
(2) Series ﬁeld I 2R
2.
Mechanical or rotational losses
(a)
Iron losses
(1) Eddy-current loss
(2) Hysteresis loss
(b)
Friction losses
(1) Bearing friction
(2) Brush friction
(3) Windage or air friction loss
Copper losses are present because power is used when a current is made to ﬂow through a resistance. As the
armature rotates in a magnetic ﬁeld, the emf induced in the iron parts causes eddy currents to ﬂow which
heat the iron and thus represent wasted energy. Hysteresis loss also results when a magnetic material is ﬁrst
magnetized in one direction and then in an opposite direction. Other rotational losses are caused by bearing
friction, the friction of the brushes riding on the commutator, and air friction or windage.
Efﬁciency is the ratio of the useful power output to total power input.
Efﬁciency = output
input
(11-7)
Also,
Efﬁciency = input −losses
input
=
output
output + losses
(11-8)
Efﬁciency is usually expressed as a percentage.
Efﬁciency (%) = output
input × 100

DIRECT-CURRENT MOTOR
Motor Principle
Although the mechanical construction of dc motors and generators is very similar, their functions are
different. The function of a generator is to generate a voltage when conductors are moved through a ﬁeld,
while that of a motor is to develop a turning effort, or torque, to produce mechanical rotation.
Direction of Armature Rotation
The left-hand rule is used to determine the direction of rotation of the armature conductors. The left-
hand rule for motors is as follows: With the foreﬁnger, middle ﬁnger, and thumb of the left hand mutually
perpendicular, point the foreﬁnger in the direction of the ﬁeld and the middle ﬁnger in the direction of the current
in the conductor; the thumb will point in the direction in which the conductor tends to move (Fig. 11-12a).
In a single-turn rectangular coil parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 11-12b), the direction of current in the left-
hand conductor is out of the paper, while in the right-hand conductor it is into the paper. Therefore, the left-hand
conductor tends to move upward with a force F1, and the right-hand conductor tends to move downward with
an equal force F2. Both forces act to develop a torque which turns the coil in a clockwise direction. A single-
coil motor (Fig. 11-12b) is impractical because it has dead centers and the torque developed is pulsating. Good
results are obtained when a large number of coils are used as in a four-pole motor (Fig. 11-13). As the armature
rotates and the conductors move away from under a pole into the neutral plane, the current is reversed in them
by the action of the commutator. Thus, the conductors under a given pole carry current in the same direction
at all times.
Torque
The torque T developed by a motor is proportional to the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and to the armature
current.
T = ktφIa
(11-9)
where
T = torque, ft-lb
kt = constant depending on physical dimensions of motor
φ = total number of lines of ﬂux entering the armature from one N pole
Ia = armature current, A

DC MOTOR EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT
Voltage and current relationships of a dc motor equivalent circuit (Fig. 11-14) are as follows:
Vta = Vg + Iara
(11-10)
Vt = Vg + Ia(ra + rs)
(11-11)
IL = Ia + If
(11-12)

[CHAP. 11
Fig. 11-14
DC motor equivalent circuit
where
Vta = armature terminal voltage, V
Vg = counter emf, V
Ia = armature current, A
Vt = motor terminal voltage, V
and ra, rs, rf , IL, and If are as deﬁned for the dc generator equivalent circuit (Fig. 11-10). A comparison of
a generator equivalent circuit (Fig. 11-10) with a motor equivalent circuit (Fig. 11-14) shows that the only
difference is the direction of line and armature current.
The counter emf of a motor, Vg, is generated by the action of the armature conductors cutting lines of
force. If in a shunt motor, Eq. (11-11) is multiplied by Ia (rs = 0),
VtIa = VgIa + I 2
a ra
(11-13)
VtIa is the power supplied to the armature of the motor; I 2
a ra is the power lost as heat in the armature current;
and VtIa is the power developed by the armature. But this armature power is not the useful output since some
of it must be used to overcome the mechanical or rotational losses of the motor. The rated output of the motor
is equal to the input (VtIL) less the heat losses (I 2R) and rotational losses. The common unit for motor output
is horsepower (hp), where
Horsepower = watts
746
(11-14)

(a) Vt = Vg + Iara
rs = 0
Vg = Vt −Iara = 240 −50(0.08) = 240 −4 = 236 V

(b) Power developed = VgIa = 236(50) = 11 800 W
Horsepower = watts
746 = 11 800

Ans.
(c) Power delivered = VtIL = 240(50) = 12 000 W = 12 kW
Ans.
SPEED OF A MOTOR
Speed is designated by the number of revolutions of the shaft with respect to time and is expressed in units
of revolutions per minute (rpm). A reduction of the ﬁeld ﬂux of a motor causes the motor speed to increase.

 
CHAP. 11]
DIRECT-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
239
Conversely, an increase in the ﬁeld ﬂux causes the motor speed to decrease. Because the speed of a motor
varies with ﬁeld excitation, a convenient means for controlling the speed is to vary the ﬁeld ﬂux by adjusting
the resistance in the ﬁeld circuit.
If a motor is able to maintain a nearly constant speed for varying loads, the motor is said to have a good
speed regulation. Speed regulation is usually expressed as a percentage as follows:
Speed regulation = no-load speed −full-load speed
full-load speed
(11-15)
Example 11.9
A 220 V shunt motor has an armature resistance of 0.2 . For a given load on the motor, the armature
current is 25 A. What is the immediate effect on the torque developed by the motor if the ﬁeld ﬂux is reduced by 2 percent?
The torque developed when Ia = 25 A is
T1 = ktφIa = 25 ktφ
(11-9)
and the counter emf is
Vg1 = Vt −Iara = 220 −25(0.2) = 215 V
If φ is reduced by 2 percent, the value of Vg is also reduced by 2 percent since Vg = kφn and the speed n cannot change
instantly. Hence, the new counter emf is
Vg2 = 0.98(215) = 210.7 V
The new armature current is
Ia2 = Vt −Vg2
ra
= 220 −210.7
0.2
= 46.5 A
and the new torque developed is
T2 = kt(0.98)φ(46.5) = 45.6 ktφ
The torque increase is
T2
T1
= 45.6 ktφ
25 ktφ
= 1.82 times
Ans.
Thus a decrease in ﬂux by 2 percent increases the torque of a motor 1.82 times. This increased torque causes the armature
speed to increase to a higher value, at which the increased counter emf (Vg ∝n) limits the armature current to a value just
high enough to carry the load at the higher speed.
Example 11.10
The no-load speed of a dc shunt motor is 1200 rpm. When the motor carries its rated load, the speed
drops to 1140. What is the speed regulation?
Speed regulation = NL speed −FL speed
FL speed
(11-15)
= 1200 −1140
1140
= 0.053 = 5.3%
Ans.
MOTOR TYPES
Shunt Motor
This is the most common type of dc motor. It is connected in the same way as the shunt generator
(Fig. 11-15a). Its characteristic speed-load and torque-load curves (Fig. 11-15b) show that the torque increases
linearly with an increase in armature current, while the speed drops slightly as the armature current is increased.
The basic speed is the full-load speed. Speed adjustment is made by inserting resistance in the ﬁeld circuit

DIRECT-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
[CHAP. 11
Fig. 11-15
Characteristics of a typical shunt motor
with a ﬁeld rheostat. At one setting of the rheostat, the motor speed remains practically constant for all loads.
Starters used with dc motors limit the armature starting current to 125–200 percent of full-load current. Care
must be taken never to open the ﬁeld circuit of a shunt motor that is running unloaded because the motor speed
will increase without limit until the motor destroys itself.
Series Motor
The ﬁeld of this type of motor is connected in series with the armature (Fig. 11-16a). The speed varies
from a very high speed at light load to a lower speed at full load (Fig. 11-16b). The series motor is suitable
for starting with heavy, connected loads (driving cranes and winches) because at high armature currents,
it develops a high torque and operates at low speed (Fig. 11-16b). At no load, the speed of a series motor will
increase without limit until the motor destroys itself (Fig. 11-16b). Large series motors are therefore generally
connected directly to their load rather than by belts and pulleys.
Fig. 11-16
Characteristics of a typical series motor
Compound Motor
It combines the operating characteristics of the shunt and series motors (Fig. 11-17a and b). The compound
motor may be operated safely at no load. As load is added, its speed decreases, and torque is greater compared
with that of a shunt motor (Fig. 11-18).

STARTING REQUIREMENTS FOR MOTORS
There are two starting requirements for motors:
1.
Both motor and supply lines are protected from ﬂow of excessive current during the starting period
by placing external resistance in series with the armature circuit.
2.
Motor-starting torque should be made as large as possible to bring the motor up to full speed in
minimum time.

A 10-hp shunt motor with an armature resistance of 0.5  is connected directly to a 220-V supply line.

current is 40 A and it is desired to limit the starting current to 150 percent of this value, ﬁnd the starting resistance that

At start-up, when a motor armature is stationary, no counter emf is being generated. The only factor limiting the
current being drawn from the supply, therefore, is the armature-circuit resistance (Fig. 11-20). At motor start-up with

Principles of Alternating Current
GENERATING AN ALTERNATING VOLTAGE
An ac voltage is one that continually changes in magnitude and periodically reverses in polarity (Fig. 12-1).
The zero axis is a horizontal line across the center. The vertical variations on the voltage wave show the
changes in magnitude. The voltages above the horizontal axis have positive (+) polarity, while voltages below
the horizontal axis have negative (−) polarity.
Fig. 12-1
An ac voltage waveform
Fig. 12-2
Loop rotating in magnetic ﬁeld produces
an ac voltage
An ac voltage can be produced by a generator, called an alternator (Fig. 12-2). In the simpliﬁed generator
shown, the conductor loop rotates through the magnetic ﬁeld and cuts lines of force to generate an induced
ac voltage across its terminals. One complete revolution of the loop around the circle is a cycle. Consider the
position of the loop at each quarter turn during a cycle (Fig. 12-3). At position A, the loop is traveling parallel
to the magnetic ﬂux and therefore cuts no lines of force. The induced voltage is zero. At top position B, the loop
cuts across the ﬁeld at 90◦to produce maximum voltage. When it reaches C, the conductor is again moving
parallel to the ﬁeld and cannot cut across the ﬂux. The ac wave from A to C is 1
2 cycle of revolution, called
an alternation. In D, the loop cuts across the ﬂux again for maximum voltage, but here the ﬂux is cut in
the opposite direction (left to right) from B (right to left). Thus the polarity at D is negative. The loop
completes the last quarter turn in the cycle where it returns to position A, the point where it started. The
cycle of voltage values is repeated in positions A′B′C′D′A′′ as the loop continues to rotate (Fig. 12-3).
A cycle includes the variations between two successive points having the same value and varying in the same
direction. For example, 1 cycle can be shown also between B and B′ (Fig. 12-3).
ANGULAR MEASUREMENT
Because the cycles of voltage correspond to rotation of the loop around a circle, parts of the circle are
expressed in angles. The complete circle is 360◦. One half cycle, or one alternation, is 180◦. A quarter turn

is 90◦. Degrees are also expressed in radians (rad). One radian is equal to 57.3◦. A complete circle has 2π rad;
therefore
360◦= 2π rad
Then

or
1 rad = 180◦
π
(12-2)
In a two-pole generator (Fig. 12-2), the rotation of the armature coil through 360 geometric degrees
(1 revolution) will always generate 1 cycle (360◦) of ac voltage. But in a four-pole generator, an armature
rotation through only 180 geometric degrees will generate 1 ac cycle or 180 electrical degrees. Therefore, the
degree markings along the horizontal axis of ac voltage or current refer to electrical degrees rather than
geometric degrees.
Example 12.1
How many radians are there in 30◦?

3 rad × 180◦/π
1 rad

Ans.
In most handheld calculators, there is a selector switch to designate angles either in degrees or radians
(DEG or RAD), so it normally will not be necessary to convert the angles. However, it is useful to know how
the angle conversions can be done.

SINE WAVE
The voltage waveform (Fig. 12-3) is called a sine wave. The instantaneous value of voltage at any point
on the sine wave is expressed by the equation
v = VM sin θ
(12-3)
where
v = instantaneous value of voltage, V
VM = maximum value of voltage, V
θ = angle of rotation, degrees (θ is the Greek lowercase letter theta)
Example 12.3
A sine wave voltage varies from zero to a maximum of 10 V. What is the value of voltage at the instant
that the cycle is at 30◦? 45◦? 60◦? 90◦? 180◦? 270◦?

v = 10 sin θ
At

v = 10 sin 30◦= 10(0.5) = 5 V
Ans.
At
45◦:
v = 10 sin 45◦= 10(0.707) = 7.07 V
Ans.
At
60◦:
v = 10 sin 60◦= 10(0.866) = 8.66 V
Ans.
At

Ans.
At 180◦:
v = 10 sin 180◦= 10(0) = 0 V
Ans.
At 270◦:
v = 10 sin 270◦= 10(−1) = −10 V
Ans.
ALTERNATING CURRENT
When a sine wave of alternative voltage is connected across a load resistance, the current that ﬂows in the
circuit is also a sine wave (Fig. 12-4).

of the voltage waveform. The maximum value of current is

FREQUENCY AND PERIOD
The number of cycles per second is called frequency. It is indicated by the symbol f and is expressed
in hertz (Hz). One cycle per second equals one hertz. Thus 60 cycles per second (formerly abbreviated cps)
equals 60 Hz. A frequency of 2 Hz (Fig. 12-7b) is twice the frequency of 1 Hz (Fig. 12-7a).
Fig. 12-7
Comparison of frequencies
The amount of time for the completion of 1 cycle is the period. It is indicated by the symbol T for time
and is expressed in seconds (s). Frequency and period are reciprocals of each other.
f = 1
T
(12-4)
T = 1
f
(12-5)
The higher the frequency, the shorter the period.
The angle of 360◦represents the time for 1 cycle, or the period T . So we can show the horizontal axis of
the sine wave in units of either electrical degrees or seconds (Fig. 12-8).

For electromagnetic radio waves, the velocity in air or a vacuum is 186 000 mi/s, or 3 × 108 m/s, which is

c = speed of light, 3 × 108 m/s, a constant

Convert f = 60 MHz to f = 60 × 106 Hz and substitute into Eq. (12-7).
λ = c
f = 3 × 108
60 × 106 = 5 m
Ans.
PHASE RELATIONSHIPS
The phase angle between two waveforms of the same frequency is the angular difference at a given instant
of time. As an example, the phase angle between waves B and A (Fig. 12-10a) is 90◦. Take the instant of time
at 90◦. The horizontal axis is shown in angular units of time. Wave B starts at maximum value and reduces
to zero value at 90◦. Wave B reaches its maximum value 90◦ahead of wave A, so wave B leads wave A
by 90◦. This 90◦phase angle between waves B and A is maintained throughout the complete cycle and all
successive cycles. At any instant of time, wave B has the value that wave A will have 90◦later. Wave B is
a cosine wave because it is displaced 90◦from wave A, which is a sine wave. Both waveforms are called
sinusoids.
PHASORS
To compare phase angles or phases of alternating voltages and currents, it is more convenient to use phasor
diagrams corresponding to the voltage and current waveforms. A phasor is a quantity that has magnitude

 
CHAP. 12]
PRINCIPLES OF ALTERNATING CURRENT
257
Fig. 12-10
Wave B leads wave A by a phase angle of 90◦
and direction. The terms phasor and vector are used for quantities that have direction. However, a phasor
quantity varies with time, while a vector quantity has direction in space. The length of the arrow in a phasor
diagram indicates the magnitude of the alternating voltage. The angle of the arrow with respect to the horizontal
axis indicates the phase angle. One waveform is chosen as the reference. Then the second waveform can be
compared with the reference by means of the angle between the phasor arrows. For example, the phasor VA
represents the voltage wave A with a phase angle of 0◦(Fig. 12-10b). The phasor VB is vertical (Fig. 12-10b)
to show the phase angle of 90◦with respect to phasor VA, which is the reference. Since lead angles are shown
in the counterclockwise direction from the reference phasor, VB leads VA by 90◦(Fig. 12-10b).
Generally, the reference phasor is horizontal, corresponding to 0◦. If VB were shown as the reference
(Fig. 12-11b), VA would have to be 90◦clockwise in order to have the same phase angle. In this case VA lags
VB by 90◦. There is no fundamental difference between VB leading VA by 90◦(Fig. 12-11a) or VA lagging
VB by 90◦(Fig. 12-11b).

PRINCIPLES OF ALTERNATING CURRENT
[CHAP. 12
When two waves are in phase (Fig. 12-12a), the phase angle is zero. Then the amplitudes add (Fig. 12-12b).
When two waves are exactly out of phase (Fig. 12-13a), the phase angle is 180◦. Their amplitudes are opposing
(Fig. 12-13b). Equal values of opposite phase cancel each other.

The phase angle is the angular distance between corresponding points on waves A and B. Convenient corresponding
points are the maximum, minimum, and zero crossing of each wave. At the zero crossings on the horizontal axis (Fig. 12-14),
the phase angle θ = 30◦. Since wave A reaches its zero crossing before wave B does, A leads B.

Wave A as reference: VB lags VA by 30◦.
Ans.
Wave B as reference: VA lags VB by 30◦.
Ans.
Though the phasors are not drawn to scale, VA is drawn smaller than VB because the maximum value of wave A is less
than that of wave B.
CHARACTERISTIC VALUES OF VOLTAGE AND CURRENT
Since an ac sine wave voltage or current has many instantaneous values throughout the cycle, it is con-
venient to specify magnitudes for comparing one wave with another. The peak, average, or root-mean-square
(rms) value can be speciﬁed (Fig. 12-15). These values apply to current or voltage.
Fig. 12-15
Amplitude values for ac sine wave
The peak value is the maximum value of VM or IM. It applies to either the positive or negative peak. The

are symmetrical.
The average value is the arithmetic average of all values in a sine wave for 1 half-cycle. The half-cycle
is used for the average because over a full cycle the average value is zero.

The rms value of an alternating sine wave corresponds to the same amount of direct current or voltage in
heating power. An alternating voltage with an rms value of 115 V, for example, is just as effective in heating
the ﬁlament of a light bulb as 115 V from a steady dc voltage source. For this reason, the rms value is also
called the effective value.
Unless indicated otherwise, all sine wave ac measurements are given in rms values. The letters V and I are
used to denote rms voltage and current. For instance, V = 220 V (an ac power-line voltage) is understood to
mean 220 V rms.

Ans.
RESISTANCE IN AC CIRCUITS
In an ac circuit with only resistance, the current variations are in phase with the applied voltage (Fig. 12-16).
This in-phase relationship between V and I means that such an ac circuit can be analyzed by the same methods
used for dc circuits. Therefore, Ohm’s laws for dc circuits are applicable also to ac circuits with resistance only.
The calculations in ac circuits are generally in rms values, unless otherwise speciﬁed. For the series circuit
(Fig. 12-16a), I = V/R = 110/10 = 11 A. The rms power dissipation is P = I 2R = 112(10) = 1210 W.

This unit usually can generate an ac voltage with a frequency as low as 20 Hz or as high as 200 MHz.

Finding the phase angle between voltage and current waveforms
To determine the phase angle, select a corresponding point on each wave. The maximum and
zero crossing corresponding points are convenient. The angular difference of the two points is the
phase angle. Then compare the two points to decide if one wave is in phase with, leading, or lagging
the other wave.
In Fig. 12-21a, curves v and i reach their maximum values at the same instant, so they are in
phase (the phasor diagram as shown).
Ans.
In Fig. 12-21b, curve v reaches its zero value at a, 45◦before curve i is zero at the corresponding
point b, so v leads i by 45◦(phasor diagram as shown).

A, B, and C are three sine ac voltage waveforms of the same frequency. Sine wave A leads sine wave B
by a phase angle of 60◦and lags sine wave C by 130◦. What is the phase angle between wave B and
wave C? Which wave is leading?
Draw the sine waves with phase angles described. A convenient way to draw or measure the phase
angle between two sine waves is to compare their zero crossings. Wave A is drawn as the reference
beginning at 0◦(Fig. 12-22). Wave B is drawn beginning at 60◦to indicate that wave A leads wave
B by 60◦. Wave C is shown beginning at −130◦to show that A lags C by that angle. Compare
the zero crossings on the horizontal axis of waves B and C as they move toward the positive cycle.
B crosses the axis upward at 60◦, while C does so at 230◦. The phase angle is the phase difference
between 230◦and 60◦, or 170◦. Since B crosses the axis before wave C, B leads C.

Ans.
In a purely resistive set of branch currents, the total current IT is in phase with the total voltage VT .
The phase angle is therefore equal to 0◦.
P = VT IT cos θ = 120(7.2)(cos 0◦) = 120(7.2)(1) = 864 W
Ans.
Since the voltage in a parallel circuit is constant, the voltage is used as the reference phasor. The
currents I1 and I2 are drawn in the same direction as the voltage because the current through pure
resistances is in phase with the voltage. The I1 phasor is shown longer than I2 because its current
value is higher (see the phasor diagram).

INDUCTION
The ability of a conductor to induce voltage in itself when the current changes is its self-inductance, or
simply inductance. The symbol for inductance is L, and its unit is the henry (H). One henry is the amount of
inductance that permits one volt to be induced when the current changes at the rate of one ampere per second
(Fig. 13-1). The formula for inductance is
L =
vL
i/t
(13-1)
where
L = inductance, H
vL = induced voltage across the coil, V
i/t = rate of change of current, A/s
Fig. 13-1
The inductance of a coil is 1 H
when a change of 1 A/s induces
1 V across the coil

(13-2)
= (50 × 10−6)(104) = 0.5 V
Ans.
When the current in a conductor or coil changes, the varying ﬂux can cut across any other conductor or
coil located nearby, thus inducing voltages in both. A varying current in L1, therefore, induces voltage across
L1 and across L2 (Fig. 13-2). When the induced voltage vL2 produces current in L2, its varying magnetic ﬁeld
induces voltage in L1. Hence, the two coils L1 and L2 have mutual inductance because current change in one
coil can induce voltage in the other. The unit of mutual inductance is the henry, and the symbol is LM. Two
coils have LM of 1 H when a current change of 1 A/s in one coil induces 1 V in the other coil.
The schematic symbol for two coils with mutual inductance is shown in Fig. 13-3.

CHARACTERISTICS OF COILS
Physical Characteristics
A coil’s inductance depends on how it is wound, the core material on which it is wound, and the number
of turns of wire with which it is wound.
1.
Inductance L increases as the number of turns of wire N around the core increases. Inductance
increases as the square of the turns increases. For example, if the number of turns is doubled (2×),
inductance increases 22 or 4×, assuming the area and length of the coil remain constant.
2.
Inductance increases as the relative permeability µr of the core material increases.
3.
As the area A enclosed by each turn increases, the inductance increases. Since the area is a function
of the square of the diameter of the coil, inductance increases as the square of the diameter.
4.
Inductance decreases as the length of the coil increases (assuming the number of turns remains
constant).
Example 13.3

10 times the diameter is

L = 2002002(1 × 10−4)
0.1
(1.26 × 10−6) = 10 × 10−3 H = 10 mH
Ans.
Core Losses
Losses in the magnetic core are due to eddy-current losses and hysteresis losses. Eddy currents ﬂow in a
circular path within the core material itself and dissipate as heat in the core. The loss is equal to I 2R, where R
is the resistance of the path through the core. The higher the frequency of alternating current in the inductance,
the higher the eddy currents and the greater the eddy-current loss.
Hysteresis losses arise from the additional power needed to reverse the magnetic ﬁeld in magnetic materials
with an alternating current. Hysteresis losses generally are less than eddy-current losses.
To reduce eddy-current losses while sustaining ﬂux density, the iron core can be made of laminated sheets
insulated from each other, insulated powdered-iron granules pressed into one solid, or ferrite material. Air-core
coils have practically no losses from eddy currents or hysteresis.
INDUCTIVE REACTANCE
Inductive reactance XL is the opposition to ac current due to the inductance in the circuit. The unit of
inductive reactance is the ohm. The formula for inductive reactance is
XL = 2πf L
(13-3)
Since 2π = 2(3.14) = 6.28, Eq. (13-3) becomes
XL = 6.28f L
where
XL = inductive reactance, 
f = frequency, Hz
L = inductance, H

INDUCTORS IN SERIES OR PARALLEL
If inductors are spaced sufﬁciently far apart so that they do not interact electromagnetically with
each other, their values can be combined just like resistors when connected together. If a number of

inductors are connected in series (Fig. 13-6), the total inductance LT is the sum of the individual
inductances, or
Series:
LT = L1 + L2 + L3 + · · · + Ln
(13-9)
If two series-connected coils are spaced close together so that their magnetic ﬁeld lines interlink, their
mutual inductance will have an effect on the circuit. In that case the total inductance is
LT = L1 + L2 ± 2LM
(13-10)
where LM is the mutual inductance between the coils. The plus (+) sign in Eq. (13-10) is used if the coils are
arranged in series-aiding form, while the minus (−) sign is used if the coils are connected in series-opposing
form. Series aiding means that the common current produces the same direction of magnetic ﬁeld for the two
coils. The series-opposing connection results in opposite ﬁelds.
Three different arrangements for coils L1 and L2 are shown both pictorially and schematically in Fig. 13-7.
In Fig. 13-7a, the coils are spaced too far apart to interact electromagnetically. There is no mutual inductance,
so LM is zero. The total inductance is LT = L1 + L2. In Fig. 13-7b, the coils are spaced close together and
have windings in the same direction, as indicated by the dots. The coils are series-aiding, so LT = L1 +
L2 + 2LM. In Fig. 13-7c, the coil windings are in the opposite direction, so the coils are series-opposing,
and LT = L1 + L2 −2LM.
The large dots above the coil (Fig. 13-7b and c) are used to indicate the polarity of the windings without
having to show the actual physical construction. Coils with dots at the same end (Fig. 13-7b) have the same
polarity or same direction of winding. When current enters the dotted ends for L1 and L2, their ﬁelds are
aiding and LM has the same sense as L.
If inductors are spaced sufﬁciently far apart so that their mutual inductance is negligible (LM = 0), the
rules for combining inductors in parallel are the same as for resistors. If a number of inductors are connected
in parallel (Fig. 13-8), their total inductance LT is

All inductances must be given in the same units. The shortcuts for calculating parallel R can be used
with parallel L. For example, if two 8-mH inductors are in parallel, the total inductance is LT = L/n =
8/2 = 4 mH.

INDUCTIVE CIRCUITS
Inductance Only
If an ac voltage v is applied across a circuit having only inductance (Fig. 13-9a), the resulting ac current
through the inductance, iL, will lag the voltage across the inductance, vL, by 90◦(Fig. 13-9b and c). Voltages v
and vL are the same because the total applied voltage is dropped only across the inductance. Both iL and vL are
sine waves with the same frequency. Lowercase letters such as i and v indicate instantaneous values; capital
letters such as I and V show dc or ac rms values.

RL in Series
When a coil has series resistance (Fig. 13-10a), the rms current I is limited by both XL and R. I is the
same in XL and R since they are in series. The voltage drop across R is VR = IR, and the voltage drop across
XL is VL = IXL. The current I through XL must lag VL by 90◦because this is the phase angle between
current through an inductance and its self-induced voltage (Fig. 13-10b). The current I through R and its IR
voltage drop are in phase so the phase angle is 0◦(Fig. 13-10b).
Fig. 13-10
R and XL in series
To combine two waveforms out of phase, we add their equivalent phasors. The method is to add the tail of
one phasor to the arrowhead of the other, using the angle to show their relative phase. The sum of the phasors
is a resultant phasor from the start of one phasor to the end of the other phasor. Since the VR and VL phasors
form a right angle, the resultant phasor is the hypotenuse of a right triangle (Fig. 13-11). From the geometry
of a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the hypotenuse is equal to the square root of the sum
of the squares of the sides. Therefore, the resultant is
VT =

V 2
R + V 2
L
(13-13)
where the total voltage VT is the phasor sum of the two voltages VR and VL that are 90◦out of phase. All the
voltages must be in the same units—rms values, peak values, or instantaneous values. For example, when VT
is an rms value, VR and VL are also rms values. Most of the ac calculations will be made in rms units.

RL in Parallel
For parallel circuits with R and XL (Fig. 13-15a), the same applied voltage VT is across R and XL since
both are in parallel with VT . There is no phase difference between these voltages. Therefore, VT will be used
as the reference phasor. The resistive branch current IR = VT /R is in phase with VT . The inductive branch
current IL = VT /XL lags VT by 90◦(Fig. 13-15b) because the current in an inductance lags the voltage across
it by 90◦. The phasor sum of IR and IL equals the total line current IT (Fig. 13-15c), or

Impedance in parallel RL.
For the general case of calculating the total impedance ZT of R and XL in
parallel, assume any number for the applied voltage VT because in the calculation of ZT in terms of the
branch currents the value of VT cancels. A convenient value to assume for VT is the value of either R or XL,
whichever is the higher number. This is only one method among others for calculating ZT .

where Ri is the internal resistance of the coil equal to the resistance of the wire in the coil (Fig. 13-17). Q is
a numerical value without any units since the ohms cancel in the ratio of reactance to resistance. If the Q of a
coil is 200, it means that the XL of the coil is 200 times more than its Ri.
The Q of a coil may range in value from less than 10 for a low-Q coil up to 1000 for a very high Q coil.
Radio frequency (RF) coils have a Q of about 30–300.

POWER IN RL CIRCUITS
In an ac circuit with inductive reactance, the line current I lags the applied voltage V . The real power P
is equal to the voltage multiplied by only that portion of the line current which is in phase with the voltage.

Ans.
or
P = VI cos θ
(13-20)
= 400(2)(cos 30◦) = 692 W
In both P calculations, the real power is the same because this is the amount of power supplied by the voltage
source and dissipated in the resistance. The inductive reactance merely transforms power back to the circuit.
Either formula for P can be used, depending on which is more convenient.
Step 4.
Find Q and S.
Q = VI sin θ

In an inductive circuit, reactive power is lagging because I lags V .

and Capacitive Circuits
CAPACITOR
A capacitor is an electrical device which consists of two conducting plates of metal separated by an
insulating material called a dielectric (Fig. 14-1a). Schematic symbols shown (Fig. 14-1b and c) apply to all
capacitors.
Fig. 14-1
Capacitor and schematic symbols
A capacitor stores electric charges in the dielectric. The two plates of the capacitor shown in Fig. 14-2a
are electrically neutral since there are as many protons (positive charge) as electrons (negative charge) on each
plate. Thus the capacitor has no charge. Now a battery is connected across the plates (Fig. 14-2b). When
the switch is closed (Fig. 14-2c), the negative charge on plate A is attracted to the positive terminal of the
battery, while the positive charge on plate B is attracted to the negative terminal of the battery. This movement
of charges will continue until the difference in charge between plates A and B is equal to the electromotive
force (voltage) of the battery. The capacitor is now charged. Since almost none of the charge can cross the
space between plates, the capacitor will remain in this condition even if the battery is removed (Fig. 14-3a).
However, if a conductor is placed across the plates (Fig. 14-3b), the electrons ﬁnd a path back to plate A and
the charges on each plate are again neutralized. The capacitor is now discharged.

Discharging a capacitor
Example 14.1
Explain the charging and discharging action of a simple capacitor circuit when switch 1 is closed with
switch 2 open (Fig. 14-4a), and when switch 1 is open with switch 2 closed (Fig. 14-4b).
When switch S1 is closed and switch S2 is open (Fig. 14-4a), the battery voltage is applied across the two plates A
and B. The capacitor charges to a voltage equal to that of the battery. Plate A is charged positively and plate B is charged
negatively. When S1 is open and S2 is closed, the excess electrons on plate B will move through S2 to plate A (Fig. 14-4b).
Now the capacitor acts as a voltage source with plate A the positive terminal and plate B the negative terminal. The motion
of electrons off plate B reduces its negative charge, and their arrival at plate A reduces its positive charge. This motion of
electrons continues until there is no charge on plate A or plate B and the voltage between the two plates is zero.

Simple capacitor circuit
CAPACITANCE
Electrically, capacitance is the ability to store an electric charge. Capacitance is equal to the amount of
charge that can be stored in a capacitor divided by the voltage applied across the plates:
C = Q
V
(14-1)

 
CHAP. 14]
CAPACITANCE, CAPACITIVE REACTANCE, AND CAPACITIVE CIRCUITS

where
C = capacitance, F
Q = amount of charge, C
V = voltage, V
Equation (14-1) can be rewritten as follows:
Q = CV
(14-2)
V = Q
C
(14-3)
The unit of capacitance is the farad (F). The farad is that capacitance that will store one coulomb of charge
in the dielectric when the voltage applied across the capacitor terminals is one volt.
The characteristic of a dielectric that describes its ability to store electric energy is called the dielectric
constant. Air is used as a reference and is given a dielectric constant of 1. Some other dielectric materials are
Teﬂon, paper, mica, Bakelite, or ceramic. Paper, for example, has an average dielectric constant of 4, meaning
it can provide an electric ﬂux density four times as great as that for air for the same applied voltage and equal
physical size.
The capacitance of a capacitor depends on the area of the conductor plates, the separation between the
plates, and the dielectric constant of the insulating material. For a capacitor with two parallel plates, the formula
to ﬁnd its capacitance is
C = k A
d (8.85 × 10−12)
(14-4)
where
C = capacitance, F
k = dielectric constant of the insulating material
A = area of the plate, m2
d = distance between the plates, m
The farad is too high a unit for most capacitors. Therefore, we conveniently use the microfarad (µF), which
equals one-millionth farad (10−6 F), the nanofarad (nF), which equals one-billionth farad (10−9 F), and the
picofarad (pF), which equals one-millionth microfarad (10−6 µF). Thus, 1 F = 106 µF = 109 nF = 1012 pF.

C = 5(7.74) = 38.7 pF

TYPES OF CAPACITORS
Commercial capacitors are named according to their dielectric. Most common are air, mica, paper, and
ceramic capacitors, plus the electrolytic type. These types are compared in Table 14-1. Most types of capacitors
can be connected to an electric circuit without regard to polarity. But electrolytic capacitors and certain ceramic
capacitors are marked to show which side must be connected to the more positive side of a circuit.

When capacitors are connected in parallel (Fig. 14-6), the total capacitance CT is the sum of the individual
capacitances.

CT = C1 + C2 + C3 + · · · + Cn
(14-7)
There is a limit to the voltage that may be applied across any capacitor. If too high a voltage is applied,
a current will be forced through the dielectric, sometimes burning a hole in it. The capacitor then will short-
circuit and must be discarded. The maximum voltage that may be applied to a capacitor is called the working
voltage and should not be exceeded.

CAPACITIVE CIRCUITS
Capacitance Only
If an ac voltage v is applied across a circuit having only capacitance (Fig. 14-13a), the resulting ac current
through the capacitance, ic, will lead the voltage across the capacitance, vc, by 90◦(Fig. 14-13b and c).
(Quantities expressed as lowercase letters, ic and vc, indicate instantaneous values.) Voltages v and vc are the
same because they are parallel. Both ic and vc are sine waves with the same frequency. In series circuits, the
current IC is the horizontal phasor for reference (Fig. 14-13d) so the voltage VC can be considered to lag IC
by 90◦.
RC in Series
As with inductive circuits, the combination of resistance and capacitive reactance (Fig. 14-14a) is called
impedance. In a series circuit containing R and XC, the same current I ﬂows in XC and R. The voltage drop
across R is VR = IR, and the voltage drop across XC is VC = IXC. The voltage across XC lags the current
through XC by 90◦(Fig. 14-14b). The voltage across R is in phase with I since resistance does not produce a
phase shift (Fig. 14-14b).

with VT . The capacitive branch current IC = VT/XC leads VT by 90◦(Fig. 14-19b). The phasor diagram has
the source voltage VT as the reference phasor because it is the same throughout the circuit. The total line

What is the total capacitance of three capacitors connected in parallel if their values are 0.15 µF,
50 V; 0.015 µF, 100 V; and 0.003 µF, 150 V (Fig. 14-21)? What would be the working voltage of this
combination?
Write Eq. (14-5) for three capacitors in parallel.
CT = C1 + C2 + C3 = 0.15 + 0.015 + 0.003 = 0.168 µF
Ans.
The working voltage of a group of parallel capacitors is only as high as the lowest working voltage.
Therefore, the working voltage of this combination is only 50 V.

A technician has the following capacitors available: 300 pF, 75 V; 250 pF, 50 V; 200 pF, 50 V; 150 pF,
75 V; and 50 pF, 75 V. Which of these should be connected in parallel to form a combination with a
capacitance of 500 pF and 75 V working voltage?

Capacitors with voltage ratings less than 75 V must not be used because of possible short-
circuit damage. The remaining capacitors with 75-V ratings are 300, 150, and 50 pF, the sum
of which is 500 pF. Therefore, the safe parallel combination is as shown in Fig. 14-22, where
CT = 300 + 150 + 50 = 500 pF.

What is the range of total capacitances available in an oscillator circuit that uses a variable tuning
capacitor of 35- to 300-pF range in series with a ﬁxed capacitor of 250 pF (Fig. 14-23)?
At the low point in the range of total capacitance, we have 35 pF in series with 250 pF.
CT 1 =
C1C2
C1 + C2
= 35(250)
35 + 250 = 8750
285 = 30.7 pF
Ans.
At the high point in the range, we have 300 pF in series with 250 pF.
CT 2 = 300(250)
300 + 250 = 75 000
550
= 136.4 pF
Ans.
Therefore, the range is from 30.7 to 136.4 pF.
14.4
What capacitance must be added in parallel with a 550-pF capacitor in order to get a total capacitance
of 750 pF (Fig. 14-24)?
Write Eq. (14-7) for two capacitors in parallel.

A capacitor draws 6 mA when connected across a 110-V 60-Hz line. What will be the current drawn
if both the frequency and capacitance are doubled?
We look at two relationships. First, because IC = VC/XC, we can say IC is inversely proportional
to XC, or
IC ∝
1
XC
Second, because XC = 0.159/fC, we can say XC is inversely proportional to the product of f
and C, or
XC ∝1
fC
So if f and C are doubled, XC is decreased by 1/4.
XC ∝
1
(2f )(2C) =

And when XC is decreased by 1/4, IC is increased four times. Therefore

THE GENERAL RLC CIRCUIT
The preceding two chapters have explained how a combination of inductance and resistance and then
capacitance and resistance behave in a series circuit and in a parallel circuit. We saw how the RL and RC
combination affect the current, voltage, power, power factor, and phase angle of a circuit. In this chapter, all
three fundamental circuit parameters—inductance, capacitance, and resistance—are combined and their effect
on circuit values studied.
RLC IN SERIES
Current in a series circuit containing resistance, inductive reactance, and capacitive reactance (Fig. 15-1a)
is determined by the total impedance of the combination. The current I is the same in R, XL, and XC since
they are in series. The voltage drop across each element is found by Ohm’s law:
VR = IR
VL = IXL
VC = IXC
where
VR = voltage drop across the resistance, V
VL = voltage drop across the inductance, V
VC = voltage drop across the capacitance, V
Fig. 15-1
R, XL, and XC in series; XL > XC for inductive circuit
The voltage drop across the resistance is in phase with the current through the resistance (Fig. 15-1b). The
voltage across the inductance leads the current through the inductance by 90◦. The voltage across the capacitance
lags the current through the capacitance by 90◦(Fig. 15-1b). Since VL and VC are exactly 180◦out of phase
and acting in exactly opposite directions, they are added algebraically. When XL is greater than XC, the circuit
is inductive, VL is greater than VC, and I lags VT (Fig. 15-1c).

When XC is greater than XL, the circuit is capacitive. Now VC is greater than VL so that I leads VT
(Fig. 15-2).

R, XL, and XC in series; XC > XL for capacitive circuit
When XL > XC, the voltage-phasor diagram (Fig. 15-1c) shows that the total voltage VT and phase angle

Ans.
So

Ans.
Note that in series resonance, the impedance of the circuit is equal to the resistance of the circuit. This is the minimum
value of impedance for the circuit. Therefore at resonance, the highest current will ﬂow.
RLC IN PARALLEL
A three-branch parallel ac circuit (Fig. 15-5a) has resistance in one branch, inductance in the second
branch, and capacitance in the third branch. The voltage is the same across each parallel branch, so VT =
VR = VL = VC. The applied voltage VT is used as the reference line to measure phase angle θ. The total
current IT is the phasor sum of IR, IL, and IC. The current in the resistance IR is in phase with the applied
voltage VT (Fig. 15-5b). The current in the inductance IL lags the voltage VT by 90◦. The current in the
capacitor IC leads the voltage VT by 90◦. IL and IC are exactly 180◦out of phase and thus acting in opposite

directions (Fig. 15-5b). When IL > IC, IT lags VT (Fig. 15-5c) so the parallel RLC circuit is considered
inductive.
If IC > IL, the current relationships and phasor triangle (Fig. 15-6) show that IT now leads VT so this
type of parallel RLC circuit is considered capacitive.

In a parallel RLC circuit, when XL > XC, the capacitive current will be greater than the inductive current
and the circuit is capacitive. When XC > XL, the inductive current is greater than the capacitive current and
the circuit is inductive. These relationships are opposite to those for a series RLC circuit.

Note that a parallel resonant circuit reduces to a resistive circuit (θ = 0◦). Because IL and IC cancel each

RL AND RC BRANCHES IN PARALLEL
Total current IT for a circuit containing parallel branches of RL and RC (Fig. 15-8) is the phasor sum of
the branch currents I1 and I2. A convenient way to ﬁnd IT is to (1) add algebraically the horizontal components
of I1 and I2 with respect to the phasor reference VT , (2) add algebraically the vertical components of I1 and
I2, and (3) form a right triangle with these two sums as legs and calculate the value of the hypotenuse (IT )
and its angle to the horizontal.

POWER AND POWER FACTOR
The instantaneous power p is the product of the current i and the voltage v at that instant of time t.
P = vi
(15-14)
When v and i are both positive or both negative, their product p is positive. Therefore, power is being expended
throughout the cycle (Fig. 15-10). If v is negative while i is positive during any part of the cycle (Fig. 15-11),
or if i is negative while v is positive, their product will be negative. This “negative power” is not available for
work; it is power returned to the line.

The product of the voltage across the resistance and the current through the resistance is always positive
and is called real power. Real power can be considered as resistive power that is dissipated as heat. Since
the voltage across a reactance is always 90◦out of phase with the current through the reactance, the product
px = vxix is always negative. This product is called reactive power and is due to the reactance of a circuit.
Similarly, the product of the line voltage and the line current is known as apparent power.
Real power, reactive power, and apparent power can be represented by a right triangle (Fig. 15-12a). From
this triangle the power formulas are:
Real power P = VRIR = VI cos θ, W
(15-15)
or
P = I 2R, W
(15-16)
P = V 2
R , W
(15-17)
Reactive power Q = VXIX = VI sin θ, VAR
(15-18)
Apparent power S = VI, VA
(15-19)
In a circuit where the net reactance is inductive, Q is lagging and shown above the horizontal axis
(Fig. 15-12b); when the net reactance is capacitive, Q is leading and shown below the horizontal axis
(Fig. 15-12c).
Fig. 15-12
Power triangle
The ratio of real power to apparent power, called the power factor (PF), is
PF =
real power
apparent power = VRIR
VI
= VI cos θ
VI
= cos θ
(15-20)
Also from Eq. (15-15),
PF = cos θ = P
VI
(15-21)
The cos θ of a circuit is the power factor, PF, of the circuit. The power factor determines what portion of
the apparent power is real power and can vary from 1 when the phase angle θ is 0◦, to 0 when θ is 90◦. When
θ = 0◦, P = V I, the formula for voltage and current of a circuit in phase. When θ = 90◦, P = V I × 0 = 0,
indicating that no power is being expended or consumed.

SINGLE-PHASE CIRCUITS
[CHAP. 15
A circuit in which the current lags the voltage (i.e., an inductive circuit) is said to have a lagging PF
(Fig. 15-12b); a circuit in which the current leads the voltage (i.e., a capacitive circuit) is said to have a
leading PF (Fig. 15-12c).
Power factor is expressed as a decimal or as a percentage. A power factor of 0.7 is the same as a power
factor of 70 percent. At unity (PF = 1 or 100 percent), the current and voltage are in phase. A 70 percent PF
means that the device uses only 70 percent of the voltampere input. It is desirable to design circuits that have
a high PF since such circuits make the most efﬁcient use of the current delivered to the load.
When we state that a motor draws 10 kVA (1 kVA = 1000 VA) from a power line, we recognize that this
is the apparent power taken by the motor. Kilovoltamperes always refers to the apparent power. Similarly,
when we say a motor draws 10 kW, we mean that the real power taken by the motor is 10 kW.

Power Factor Correction
In order to make the most efﬁcient use of the current delivered to a load, we desire a high PF or a PF
that approaches unity. A low PF is generally due to the large inductive loads, such as induction motors, which
take a lagging current. In order to correct this low PF, it is necessary to bring the current as closely in phase
with the voltage as possible. That is, the phase angle θ is made as small as possible. This is usually done by
placing a capacitive load, which produces a leading current, in parallel with the inductive load.
Example 15.10
With the use of a phasor diagram show how the PF produced by an inductive motor can be corrected
to unity.
We show an induction motor circuit (Fig. 15-13a) and its current-phasor diagram (Fig. 15-13b). Current I lags the
voltage V by an angle θ where PF = cos θ = 0.7. We desire to raise the PF to 1.0. We do this by connecting a capacitor
across the motor (Fig. 15-14a). If the capacitor current is equal to the inductive current, the two cancel one another
(Fig. 15-14b). The line current I1 is now less than its original value and in phase with V so that PF = cos 0◦= 1. Notice
that the current through the motor I remains unchanged. The reactive part of the current to the motor is being supplied by
the capacitor. The line now has only to supply the component of current for the resistive part of the motor load.

Step 2.
Find the kilovoltampere rating of the capacitor. In order to raise the PF to 1, the capacitor

A plant load draws 2000 kVA from a 240-V line at a PF of 0.7 lagging. Calculate the kilovoltamperage
required of a capacitor bank in parallel with the plant for the overall PF to be 0.9 lagging.
We use the method of power triangles.
PF = cos θ = 0.7
θ = arccos 0.7 = 45.6◦
Real power of the plant load:
P = VI cos θ = 2000(0.7) = 1400 kW
Reactive power of the plant load:
Q = VI sin θ = 2000 sin 45.6◦= 1430 kVAR lagging
Therefore, the power triangle of the original plant is as shown in Fig. 15-25a.
Fig. 15-25
Method of power triangles
We add a parallel capacitor bank to improve the power factor of the plant to 0.9 lagging. The total
real power remains the same. We calculate the new Q of the plant.
(PF)1 = cos θ = 0.9
θ1 = arccos 0.9 = 25.8◦
Q1 = 1400 tan 25.8◦= 677 kVAR lagging
The total reactive power of a circuit is equal to the algebraic sum of the reactive powers of each
branch. Therefore,
Q of the capacitor bank = original Q of the plant −new Q of the plant
= 1430 −677 = 753 kVAR leading
Thus
S of the capacitor bank = 753 kVA
Ans.
The power triangle with the capacitor bank added (Fig. 15-25b) shows how the leading Q of the
capacitor reduces the overall plant Q to 677 kVAR lagging to produce an improved PF of 0.9.

Alternating-Current Generators and Motors
ALTERNATORS
Alternating-current generators are also called alternators. Almost all electric power for homes and industry
is supplied by alternators in power plants. A simple alternator consists of (1) a strong, constant magnetic ﬁeld;
(2) conductors that rotate across the magnetic ﬁeld; and (3) some means of making a continuous connection to
the conductors as they are rotating (Fig. 16-1). The magnetic ﬁeld is produced by current ﬂowing through the
stationary, or stator, ﬁeld coil. Field-coil excitation is supplied by a battery or other dc source. The armature,
or rotor, rotates within the magnetic ﬁeld. For a single turn of wire around the rotor, each is connected to a
separate slip ring, which is insulated from the shaft. Each time the rotor turn makes one complete revolution,
one complete cycle of alternating current is developed (Fig. 16-2). A practical alternator has several hundred
turns wound into the slots of the rotor. Two brushes are spring-held against the slip rings to provide the
continuous connection between the alternating current induced in the rotor or armature coil and the external
circuits.
Fig. 16-1
A simple alternator having a stationary ﬁeld and a rotating
armature
The small ac generator usually has a stationary ﬁeld and a rotating armature (Fig. 16-1). One disadvantage
is that the slip-ring and brush contacts are in series with the load. If these parts become worn or dirty, current
ﬂow may be interrupted. However, if the dc ﬁeld excitation is connected to the rotor, the formerly stationary
coils will have alternating current induced into them (Fig. 16-3). A load can be connected across these armature
coils without the necessity of any moving contacts in the circuit. Field excitation is fed to the rotating ﬁeld
through the slip rings and brushes. Another advantage of this rotating-ﬁeld and stationary-armature generator
is the greater ease of insulating stator ﬁelds compared with insulating rotating ﬁeld coils. Since voltages as
high as 18 000–24 000 V are commonly generated, this high voltage need not be brought out through slip
rings and brushes but can be brought directly to the switch gear through insulated leads from the stationary
armature.
The amount of generated voltage of an ac generator depends on the ﬁeld strength and speed of the rotor.
Since most generators are operated at constant speed, the amount of emf depends on ﬁeld excitation.

Ans.
Example 16.2
An alternator is operating at 120 V with no load. A load is now applied to the generator. The voltage
output drops (the ﬁeld current remains the same) to 110 V. What is the regulation?
Voltage regulation = no-load voltage −full-load voltage
full-load voltage
(16-2)
= 120 −110

110 = 0.091 = 9.1%
Ans.
When the output voltage is not steady, there would be a constant ﬂickering of electric lights, and TV sets would not operate
properly. Automatic voltage-regulator devices are used to make up for the drop in output voltage by increasing the ﬁeld
current. Voltage regulation is usually a function external to the alternator.

ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
[CHAP. 16
PARALLELING GENERATORS
Most power plants have several ac generators operating in parallel in order to increase the power available.
Before two generators may be paralleled, their terminal voltages must be equal, their voltages must be in
phase, and their frequencies must be equal. When these conditions are met, the two generators are operating
in synchronism. The operation of getting the generators into synchronism is called synchronizing.
RATINGS
Nameplate data for a typical ac generator (Fig. 16-4) include manufacturer’s name, serial, and type number;
speed (rpm), number of poles, frequency of output, number of phases, and maximum supply voltage; capacity
rating in kilovoltamperes and kilowatts at a speciﬁed power factor and maximum output voltage; armature and
ﬁeld current per phase; and maximum temperature rise.

LOSSES AND EFFICIENCY
Losses of an ac generator are similar to those of a dc generator and include armature copper loss, ﬁeld-
excitation copper loss, and mechanical losses.
Efﬁciency (Eff) is the ratio of the useful power output to the total power input:
Eff = output
input
(16-3)
Example 16.3
A 2-hp motor running at rated output acts as the prime mover for an alternator that has a load demand
of 1.1 kW. What is the efﬁciency of the alternator in percent? Neglect ﬁeld excitation.
Input power = 2 hp × 746 W
hp
= 1492 W
Output power = 1.1 kW = 1100 W
Eff = output
input = 1100
1492 = 0.737 = 73.7%
Ans.
Since the prime mover is supplying 1492 W but the alternator is delivering 1100 W to the load, there must be 392 W of
loss in the alternator.

POLYPHASE INDUCTION MOTORS
Principle of Operation
The induction motor is the most commonly used type of ac motor because of its simple, rugged construction
and good operating characteristics. It consists of two parts: the stator (stationary part) and the rotor (rotating
part). The stator is connected to the ac supply. The rotor is not connected electrically to the ac supply. The
most important type of polyphase induction motor is the three-phase motor. (Three-phase machines have three
windings and deliver an output between several pairs of wires.) When the stator winding is energized from a
three-phase supply, a rotating magnetic ﬁeld is created. As the ﬁeld sweeps across the rotor conductors, an emf
is induced in these conductors which causes current to ﬂow in them. The rotor conductors carrying current in
the stator ﬁeld thus have a torque exerted upon them that spins the rotor.
Squirrel-Cage Motor and Wound-Rotor Motor
Three-phase induction motors are classiﬁed into two types: squirrel-cage (Fig. 16-5) and wound-rotor
motors (Fig. 16-6). Both motors have the same stator construction, but differ in rotor construction. The stator
core is built of slotted sheet-steel laminations. Windings are spaced in the stator slots to form the three separate
sets of poles.
Fig. 16-5
Cutaway view of a squirrel-cage induction
motor (Courtesy of General Electric Com-
pany; from E. C. Lister, Electric Circuits and
Machines, 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York,
1975, p. 247)
The rotor of a squirrel-cage motor has a laminated core, with conductors placed parallel to the shaft
and embedded in slots around the perimeter of the core. The rotor conductors are not insulated from the
core. At each end of the rotor, the rotor conductors are all short-circuited by continuous end rings. If the
laminations were not present, the rotor conductors and their end rings would resemble a revolving squirrel cage
(Fig. 16-7).
The rotor of a wound-rotor motor is wound with an insulated winding similar to the stator winding.
The rotor phase windings are brought out to the three slip rings mounted on the motor shaft (Fig. 16-6).
The rotor winding is not connected to the supply. The slip rings and brushes merely provide a means of
connecting an external rheostat into the rotor circuit. The purpose of the rheostat is to control the speed of
the motor.

Speed and Slip
The speed of the rotating magnetic ﬁeld is called the synchronous speed of the motor.
n = 120f
p
(16-4)
where
n = speed of rotating magnetic ﬁeld, rpm
f = frequency of rotor current, Hz
p = total number of poles
It is noted that the same relation exists between the frequency, number of poles, and synchronous speed of a
motor [Eq. (16-4)] as exists between the frequency, number of poles, and speed of rotation of an ac generator
[Eq. (16-1)].

 
CHAP. 16]
ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
367
An induction motor cannot run at synchronous speed since then the rotor would be standing still with
respect to the rotating ﬁeld and no emf would be induced in the rotor. The rotor speed must be slightly less
than synchronous speed in order that current be induced in the rotor to permit rotor rotation. The difference
between rotor speed and synchronous speed is called slip and is expressed as a percent of synchronous speed.
Percent S = NS −NR
NS

(16-5)
where
S = slip
NS = synchronous speed, rpm
NR = rotor speed, rpm

1800100 = 2.6%
Ans.
Rotor Frequency
For any value of slip, the rotor frequency is equal to the stator frequency times the percent slip, or
fR = SfS
(16-6)
where
fR = rotor frequency, Hz
S = percent slip (written as a decimal)
fS = stator frequency, Hz
Example 16.5
At a slip of 2.6 percent for the induction motor in Example 16.4, what is the rotor frequency?
fS = 60 Hz
given
fR = SfS
(16-6)
= 0.026(60) = 1.56 Hz
Ans.
Torque
The torque of an induction motor depends on the strength of the interacting rotor and stator ﬁelds and the
phase relations between them.
T = kφIR cos θR
(16-7)
where
T = torque, lb · ft
k = constant
φ = rotating stator ﬂux, lines of ﬂux
IR = rotor current, A
cos θR = rotor power factor

 
368
ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
[CHAP. 16
Throughout the normal range of operation, k, φ, and cos θR are nearly constant so that T is directly proportional
to IR. Rotor current IR in turn increases in almost direct proportion to the motor slip. Variation of torque with
slip (Fig. 16-8) shows that as slip increases from zero to about 10 percent, the torque linearly increases with
the slip. As load and slip are increased beyond rated or full-load torque, the torque reaches a maximum value at
about 25 percent slip. This maximum value of torque is called the breakdown torque of the motor. If the load is
further increased beyond the breakdown point, the motor will quickly come to a stop. For typical squirrel-cage
motors, the breakdown torque varies from 20 to 300 percent of full-load torque. The starting torque is the
value at 100 percent slip (rotor speed is zero) and is normally 150–200 percent of full-load rating. As the rotor
accelerates, the torque increases to its maximum value and then decreases to the value required to carry the
load on the motor at a constant speed.
Fig. 16-8
Variation of torque with slip for a typical
squirrel-cage motor
SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS
Like induction motors, synchronous motors have stator windings that produce a rotating magnetic ﬁeld.
But unlike the induction motor, the rotor circuit of a synchronous motor is excited by a dc source. The rotor
locks into step with the rotating magnetic ﬁeld and rotates at the same speed, as given by Eq. (16-4). If the
rotor is pulled out of step with the rotating stator ﬁeld, no torque is developed and the motor stops. Since a
synchronous motor develops torque only when running at synchronous speed, it is not self-starting and hence
needs some device to bring the rotor to synchronous speed.
Example 16.6
What is the slip of a synchronous motor?
Since the synchronous speed is equal to the rotor speed, NS = NR,
Percent S = NS −NR
NS

(16-5)

0
NS
100 = 0%
Ans.
An ac electric clock uses a synchronous motor to maintain the correct time (as long as the frequency of the ac supply
remains constant).
Starting Synchronous Motors
A synchronous motor may be started rotating with a dc motor on a common shaft. After the motor is
brought to synchronous speed, alternating current is applied to the stator windings. The dc starting motor now

 
CHAP. 16]
ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
369
acts as a dc generator, which supplies dc ﬁeld excitation for the rotor. The load then can be coupled to the
motor. More often synchronous motors are started by means of a squirrel-cage winding embedded in the face
of the rotor poles. The motor is then started as an induction motor and is brought to about 95 percent of
synchronous speed. At the proper time, direct current is applied and the motor pulls into synchronism. The
amount of torque needed to pull the motor into synchronism is called the pull-in torque.
Effect of Loading Synchronous Motors
In the synchronous motor, the rotor is locked into step magnetically with the rotating magnetic ﬁeld
and must continue to rotate at synchronous speed for all loads. At no load the center lines of a pole of the
rotating magnetic ﬁeld and a dc ﬁeld pole coincide (Fig. 16-9a). When load is added to the motor, there is
a backward shift of the rotor pole relative to the stator pole (Fig. 16-9b). There is no change in speed. The
angular displacement between the rotor and stator poles is called the torque angle α.
Fig. 16-9
Relative positions of a stator pole and a dc ﬁeld pole
When a synchronous motor operates at no load (torque angle practically 0◦), the counter emf Vg is equal
to the applied or terminal voltage Vt (neglecting motor losses) (Fig. 16-10a). With increasing loads and torque
angles, the phase position of Vg changes with respect to Vt which allows more stator current to ﬂow to carry
additional load (Fig. 16-10b). Vt and Vg are no longer in direct opposition. Their resultant voltage Vr causes
a current I to ﬂow in the stator windings. I lags Vr by nearly 90◦because of the high inductance of the stator
windings. θ is the phase angle between Vt and I. An increase in load results in a larger torque angle, which
increases Vr and I (Fig. 16-10c).
If the mechanical load is too high, the rotor is pulled out of synchronism and comes to a stop. The
maximum value of torque that a motor can develop without losing its synchronism is called its pull-out torque.
If the synchronous motor has a squirrel-cage winding, it will continue to operate as an induction motor.
Ratings and Efﬁciency
Synchronous-motor nameplate data include the same items found on ac generator nameplates, with the
horsepower rating replacing the kilovoltampere rating.
The efﬁciency of synchronous motors is generally higher than that of induction motors of the same
horsepower and speed rating. The losses are the same as those of synchronous generators.
Synchronous motors are used for constant-speed power applications in sizes above 20 hp. A common
application is driving air or gas compressors.
Power Factor Correction with Synchronous Motors
An outstanding advantage of a synchronous motor is that it operates at unity or leading power factor (PF).
By varying the strength of the dc ﬁeld, the overall power factor of a synchronous motor can be adjusted over
a considerable range. Thus the motor can be made to appear as a leading load across the line. If an electrical

ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
[CHAP. 16

Phasor diagrams for a synchronous motor for three different load conditions with same dc ﬁeld excitation
system is operating at a lagging power factor, synchronous motors connected across the line and adjusted for
leading PF can improve (that is, raise) the system PF. Any improvement in PF increases supply capacity to the
load, raises efﬁciency, and in general improves the operating characteristics of the system.
Field Excitation Used to Change Power Factor of Motor
For a constant mechanical load, the PF of a synchronous motor may be varied from a leading value to
a lagging value by adjusting its dc ﬁeld excitation (Fig. 16-11). Field excitation is adjusted so that PF = 1
(Fig. 16-11a). At the same load, when the ﬁeld excitation is increased, the counter emf Vg increases. This results
in a change in phase between stator current I and terminal voltage Vt so that the motor operates at a leading PF
(Fig. 16-11b). If the ﬁeld excitation is reduced below the value represented (Fig. 16-11a), the motor operates at

shows how stator current varies at a constant load with rotor ﬁeld excitation (Fig. 16-12). Power factor may
also be read when the ﬁeld current is varied.

Example 16.7
The load of an industrial plant is 400 kVA at a PF of 75 percent lagging. What must be the PF of the
added 100-kW load of a synchronous motor if it improved the overall plant PF to 100 percent?
For PF = 1, the net reactive power of the plant must be equal to zero.
Step 1.
Find the initial reactive power of the plant (Fig. 16-13a and b).
PF = cos θ = 0.75
given
θ = arccos 0.75 = 41.4◦
P = S cos θ = 400(0.75) = 300 kW
Q = S sin θ = 400 sin 41.4◦= 264.5 kVAR lagging
Step 2.
Find the PF of the synchronous motor load (Fig. 16-13c). For a net PF = 1, the reactive power of the motor must
equal the initial reactive power of the plant in the opposite direction. The Q of the plant (Step 1) is 264.5 kVAR
lagging. So the QL of the added load must be 264.5 kVAR leading.
θL = arctan 264.5
100 = arctan 2.64 = 69.3◦
PF = cos θL = cos 69.3◦= 0.353 = 35.3% leading
Ans.
The resultant power triangle (Fig. 16-13d) shows a plant load of 400 kW (300 kW + 100 kW) at a PF of unity.

Commutator Motor
AC series motor.
When an ordinary dc series motor is connected to an ac supply, the current drawn by
the motor is low due to the high series-ﬁeld impedance. The result is low running torque. To reduce the ﬁeld
reactance to a minimum, ac series motors are built with as few turns as possible. Armature reaction is overcome
by using compensating windings in the pole pieces.
The operating characteristics are similar to those of dc series motors. The speed increases to a high value
with a decrease in load. The torque is high for high armature currents so that the motor has a good starting
torque. AC series motors operate more efﬁciently at low frequencies. Some of the larger sizes used in railroad
engines operate at 25 Hz or less. However, fractional horsepower sizes are designed to operate at 50 or 60 Hz.
Repulsion motor.
The repulsion motor has an armature and commutator similar to that of a dc motor.
However, the brushes are not connected to the supply but are short-circuited (Fig. 16-14). The stator windings
produce a current in the rotor windings by induction. This current produces magnetic poles in the rotor. The
orientation of these poles is dependent on the position of the brushes. The interaction of the rotor ﬁeld with
the stator ﬁeld creates the motor torque. The repulsion motor has a high starting torque and a high speed at
light loads. It is used where heavy starting loads are expected.
Fig. 16-14
Repulsion motor
Induction Motor
A single-phase induction motor is not self-starting. The magnetic ﬁeld set up in the stator by the ac power
supply stays lined up in one direction. This magnetic ﬁeld, though stationary, pulsates as the voltage sine wave
does. This pulsating ﬁeld induces a voltage in the rotor windings, but the rotor ﬁeld can only line up with the
stator ﬁeld. With these two ﬁelds in direct line, no torque is developed. It is necessary then to turn the rotor by
some auxiliary device. Once the rotor is rotating with sufﬁcient speed, the interaction between the rotor and
stator ﬁelds will maintain rotation. The rotor will continue to increase in speed, trying to lock into synchronous
speed. It ﬁnally will reach an equilibrium speed equal to the synchronous speed minus slip.
Split-phase motor.
If two stator windings of unequal impedance are spaced 90 electrical degrees apart but
connected in parallel to a single-phase source, the ﬁeld produced will appear to rotate. This is the principle of
phase splitting.
In the split-phase motor, the starting winding has a higher resistance and lower reactance than the main
winding (Fig. 16-15a). When the same voltage Vt is applied to both windings, the current in the main winding
Im lags behind the current in the starting winding Is (Fig. 16-15b). The angle φ between the main and starting
windings is enough phase difference to provide a weak rotating magnetic ﬁeld to produce a starting torque.

 
374
ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS AND MOTORS
[CHAP. 16
When the motor reaches a predetermined speed, usually 70–80 percent of synchronous speed, a centrifugal
switch mounted on the motor shaft opens, thereby disconnecting the starting winding.
Fig. 16-15
Split-phase motor
Because it has a low starting torque, this motor type is widely used for easily started loads. It is seldom
used in sizes larger than 1
3 hp. Common applications include driving washing machines and woodworking
tools.
Capacitor-Start Motor.
By placing a capacitor in series with the starting winding of a split-phase motor
(Fig. 16-15a), starting characteristics are improved. The current in the starting winding may be made to lead
the voltage (Fig. 16-16). φ may be made nearly 90◦, resulting in a higher starting torque. This motor also
uses a centrifugal switch to disconnect the starting winding. Thus the capacitor is in the circuit only during the
starting period.
Fig. 16-16
Phase relations
in the capacitor-
start motor
Fig. 16-17
Capacitor motor
Capacitor Motor.
The capacitor motor operates with an auxiliary winding and series capacitor perma-
nently connected to the line (Fig. 16-17). The capacitance in series may be of one value for starting and another
value for running. As the motor approaches synchronous speed, the centrifugal switch disconnects one section
of the capacitor.
Repulsion-start induction motor.
Like a dc motor, the rotor of the repulsion-start induction motor has
windings connected to a commutator. Starting brushes make contact with the commutator so the motor starts
as a repulsion motor. As the motor nears full speed, a centrifugal device short-circuits all the commutator
segments so that it operates as an induction motor. This type of motor is made in sizes ranging from 1
2 to 15 hp
and is used in applications requiring a high starting torque.

Shaded-pole motor.
A shaded-pole is produced by a short-circuited coil wound around a part of each pole of
a motor. The coil is usually a single band or strap of copper. The effect of the coil is to produce a small sweeping
motion of the ﬁeld ﬂux from one side of the pole piece to the other as the ﬁeld pulsates (Fig. 16-18). This slight
shift in the magnetic ﬁeld produces a small starting torque. Thus shaded-pole motors are self-starting. As the
ﬁeld in the pole piece increases, a current is induced in the shading coil. This current causes a magnetic ﬁeld
that opposes the main ﬁeld. The main ﬁeld therefore will concentrate on the opposite side of the pole pieces
(Fig. 16-18a). As the ﬁeld begins to decrease, the shading-coil ﬁeld will aid the main ﬁeld. The concentration
of ﬂux then moves to the other edge of the pole piece (Fig. 16-18b). This method of motor starting is used in
very small motors, up to about
1
25 hp, for driving small fans, small appliances, and clocks.
Fig. 16-18
Action of the magnetic ﬁeld in a shaded-pole motor
Synchronous Motor
Several types exist to drive electric clocks, phonograph turntables, and other devices requiring precise
rotation. One type is called the Warren synchronous motor. It starts by the use of shading coils in the pole
piece. The motor is brought up to synchronous speed from the effects of eddy currents ﬂowing in the rotor
iron and of hysteresis. Its principal use is in clocks and other timing devices.

Draw phasor diagrams of an ac generator operating when PF = 1.0, 0.8 lagging, and 0.8 leading.
Let IR and IXL be voltage drops due to resistance and inductive reactance in the armature winding,
respectively.
Vg = generated emf
Vt = terminal voltage
I = armature current
Vg is the phasor sum of Vt, the IR drop which is in phase with I, and the IXL drop which leads I by
90◦(Fig. 16-20). Vg is not constant but varies with the amount of load and PF of the load. At lagging
PF, Vg is lowered. The lower the PF in the lagging direction, the less Vg. At leading PF, Vg increases
with load.

It is important to understand complex numbers because impedance, voltage, and current of ac circuits are
best expressed in terms of complex numbers. Circuit calculations are simpliﬁed when using complex numbers.
In previous chapters, ac circuits were analyzed without applying complex numbers.
DEFINITION OF A COMPLEX NUMBER
A complex number z has the form x + jy where x and y are real numbers and j is the unit imaginary
number. It is conventional to use a bold face letter symbol for all complex numbers. In complex number
x + jy, the ﬁrst term x is called the real part and the second term jy is called the imaginary part.

Imaginary part
Complex numbers can be represented by perpendicular axes, one axis representing the real part and the
other axis the imaginary part (Fig. 17-1).
Fig. 17-1
Real and imaginary axes
Eight complex numbers, z1, through z8, are plotted in Fig. 17-2.
Note that for z1 = 4, so y = 0 and hence z1 is a real number 4 and corresponds to a point on the real
axis. Note that for z4 = j6, x = 0, so that z4 is a pure imaginary number j6 and corresponds to a point on
the j axis. Thus, complex numbers include all real and all pure imaginary numbers.
OPERATOR j
The unit imaginary number j is known as operator j. When operator j is multiplied by a real number a,
j × a means a 90◦change of a in a counterclockwise direction (Fig. 17-3a). When we multiply j twice,
j × j × a = j2 × a = −a, the result is 180◦counterclockwise change in direction shown in (b). When we
multiply j three times, j × j × j × a = j3 × a = j(j2) × a = −j × a, the change in direction is 270◦shown
in (c). And when j is multiplied four times, j ×j ×j ×j ×a = j4 ×a = (j2) (j2)×a = (−1) (−1)×a = a,
we go back full circle as shown in (d).

RECTANGULAR AND POLAR FORMS OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
Consider the complex number
z = x + jy
(17-1)
The graph of z is shown in Fig. 17-5. The quadrature (90-degree) components of z are given by the numbers
x and y. Since y is multiplied by j, it lies on the imaginary axis. The form x + jy is called the rectangular
form. Another way to indicate a complex number is the polar form expressed as
z = z

OPERATIONS WITH COMPLEX NUMBERS
As with ordinary numbers, complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided.
Addition
Complex numbers may be added when they appear in rectangular form. To add two or more complex
numbers, add the reals, add the imaginaries, and then add the result. For example,
(2 + j4) + (3 −j1) = (2 + 3)

If complex numbers are given in the polar form, convert them ﬁrst into rectangular form and then add.

Multiplication
Complex numbers may be multiplied in either the rectangular or polar form. Given two numbers in
rectangular form, follow the rule of algebra for multiplying two terms. For example,
(2 + j4) (3 −j1) = 2(3) + (j4) (3) + 2 (−j1) + (j4) (−j1)
= 6 + j12 −j2 + 4
= (6 + 4) + j(12 −2)

Finally, convert product to rectangular form:
x = 14.16 cos 45◦= 14.16(0.707) = 10
y = 14.16 sin 45◦= 14.16(0.707) = 10
Therefore,
(2 + j4)(3 −j1) = 14.16

45◦= 10 + j10

Ans.
The Conjugate Complex Number
The conjugate of a complex number is obtained when the sign of the imaginary part of the number is
changed. For example, 3 + j2 has the conjugate 3 −j2. These two complex numbers are referred to as
conjugate pair. The conjugate of z is indicated by z∗.
When we multiply zz ∗, we ﬁnd
zz ∗= (3 + j2) (3 −j2) = 32 + j6 −j6 + 22
= 9 + 4 = 13, a real number
We shall use this product property in the division of complex numbers.
Division
Complex numbers may be divided in either the rectangular or polar form. For example,
8 −j4
2 + j1 = ?
To eliminate the imaginary part from the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by the
conjugate of the denominator.
8 −j4
2 + j1 × 2 −j1
2 −j1 = 16 −j8 −j8 + j24
4 + 1
= 12 −j16
5
= 12
5 −j 16

= 2.4 −j3.2
This process of converting the denominator to a real number without any j term is called rationalization.
When complex numbers are given in polar form, we may perform division by using the formula,

COMPLEX IMPEDANCE IN SERIES
Consider the impedance Z of a circuit as a phasor quantity with magnitude and direction. A series RL
circuit is shown in Fig. 17-8a.

The impedance of a series RL circuit is
Z = R + jXL

XL = inductive reactance of the circuit,  (XL = 2πfL)
Equation (17-6) deﬁnes impedance Z as the phasor sum of the real quantity R and the imaginary quantity
jXL, as shown in Fig. 17-8c. Inductive reactance is indicated as XL in (b).

θ is the phase angle between the input voltage and its resulting current in the circuit. Although impedance Z
does not vary sinusoidally, it is considered as a phasor because it determines the phase angle between voltage
and current.

Equation (17-8) shows impedance as the phasor sum of R and −jXC, as indicated in the impedance triangle

AC Circuit Analysis with Complex Numbers
PHASORS
A phasor is a complex number associated with a phase-shifted alternating voltage or current. If the phasor
is in polar form, the magnitude is the effective (rms) value of the voltage or current and its angle is the phase
angle of its phase-shifted alternating voltage or current. (See section on phasors, Chapter 12, Principles of
Alternating Current.)
TWO-TERMINAL NETWORK
For a two-terminal circuit with an input phasor voltage V and an input phasor current I (Fig. 18-1), the
impedance Z of the circuit is deﬁned as the ratio of V to I.
Z = V
I
(18-1)
Then
I = V
Z
(18-2)
and
V = IZ
(18-3)
Bold letters are used to show phasor quantities.
Fig. 18-1
Two-terminal network
Equation (18-3) is sometimes called “Ohm’s law for alternating current.” Voltage, current, and impedance
quantities are complex numbers.

AC CIRCUIT ANALYSIS WITH COMPLEX NUMBERS
[CHAP. 18
I causes a voltage drop across each impedance: V1 across Z1, V2 across Z2, and V3 across Z3.
Kirchhoff’s voltage law states that the sum of the voltage rises is equal to the sum of the voltage drops
around any closed path. Applying this law to the series circuit (Fig. 18-2), we have
V = V1 + V2 + V3
(18-4)
Also
V = IZ
(18-3)
Then
V1 = IZ1, V2 = IZ2, and V3 = IZ3
So
V = IZ1 + IZ2 + IZ3
= I(Z1 + Z2 + Z3)
We can rewrite
V = VT = IT ZT
(18-5)
where VT is total voltage, IT is total current, and ZT is total impedance
where
ZT = Z1 + Z2 + Z3
(18-6)
For multiple n impedances in series,
ZT = Z1 + Z2 + Z3 + · · · + Zn
(18-7)

In the series ac circuit (Fig. 18-3a), ﬁnd ZT and IT , and draw the phasor diagram. Also verify KVL by

PARALLEL AC CIRCUIT
A single voltage source is applied to an ac parallel circuit with three impedances (Fig. 18-4). We may
apply Kirchhoff’s current law that the sum of the currents entering a junction, say at A, is equal to the sum of
the currents leaving a junction, so that

Ans.
It is convenient to use VT as the reference line because its given phase angle is 0◦, as shown in (a). We also
could show the phasor diagram with IT as the reference line shown in (b). In both phasor diagrams, IT lags VT
by 21.8◦.
Generally in drawing the phasor diagram for series circuits, we use current as the reference because current
is the same in all parts of the circuit. In parallel circuits the current may be different in each part, but the voltage
is the same for every branch. Thus, the reference line in parallel circuits is often chosen as the voltage.

COMPLEX POWER
Introduction
AC power has been discussed without use of complex numbers in Chapters 13–15. Power formulas from
these chapters are repeated for quick reference.
Real power P = VI cos θ, W
(13-20)
(14-21)
(15-15)
P = I 2R, W
(13-21)
(14-22)
(15-16)
Reactive power Q = VI sin θ, VAR
(13-22)
(14-23)
(15-18)
Apparent power S = VI, VA
(13-23)
(14-24)
(15-19)
Power factor PF = cos θ
(15-20)
V is input voltage, I is input current, and θ is the phase angle between V and I.
One use for complex power is to obtain the total complex power of several loads in parallel energized by
the same source. The total complex power is the sum of the individual complex powers regardless of how the
loads are connected. Therefore, total real power is the sum of the individual real powers, and total reactive
power is the sum of the individual reactive powers. The same is not true to obtain total apparent power. Another
use for complex power is in power factor correction.
Complex Power Formulas
By deﬁnition, the complex power formula is
S = P + jQ
(18-10)
having components P and Q (Fig. 18-8)
where
S = complex power in voltamperes, VA
S = magnitude of S = VI = apparent power in voltamperes, VA
P = real power in watts, W
Q = reactive power in voltamperes reactive, VAR; also referred to as vars for industrial applications.

Complex power S is a complex quantity with magnitude S equal to the product of the input voltage V and the
input current I, both in rms or effective values, and with a phase angle θ between V and I.
Other formulas that can be used to determine components of the complex power triangle (Fig. 18-8), using
V = IZ, are
S = VI = (IZ)I = I 2Z
(18-14)
P = VI cos θ = (IZ)I cos θ = I 2(Z cos θ) = I 2R
(18-15)
Q = VI sin θ = (IZ)I sin θ = I 2(Z sin θ) = I 2X
(18-16)
V , I, and Z represent the magnitude of voltage, current, and impendence, respectively. The magnitude of these
quantities can be shown also as V = |V|, I = |I|, and Z = |Z| by placing bars by the phasor quantity.
A third formula for complex power is
S = VI∗
(18-17)
where I∗is the conjugate of the input current phasor I and V is the input voltage phasor.
Note from Eq. (18-15) that R = Z cos θ is the input resistance, the same as the real part of the input
impedance. R is usually not the resistance of a physical resistor, but the real part of the input impedance and
is usually dependent on inductive and capacitive reactances, as well as on resistances. It is important to note
that S is a complex number, but does not represent a sinusoidally varying quantity.
Power Factor
The term “cos θ” is called the power factor, PF. The angle θ is called the power factor angle. θ is often
also the impedance angle. The power factor of an inductive circuit is called a lagging power factor, and that
of a capacitive circuit is called a leading power factor. If a circuit has only resistance, the PF = 1; if it has
only reactance, PF = 0.
To deliver a large amount of power, a high PF, i.e., close to 1, is desirable.
We see from
P = VI cos θ
(18-12)
I =
P
V cos θ =
P
V × PF
that by having a smaller PF, the current I to the load becomes greater. Larger than necessary currents are
undesirable due to the accompanying large IR voltage losses and I 2R power losses in power lines.
Reactive Power Q
Reactive power is often used for industrial power consideration. The sign convention for Q is positive
(+Q) for an inductive load shown above the real axis, and is minus (−Q) for a capacitive load shown below
the real axis; that is, +Q consumes reactive power and −Q produces reactive power. Reactance does not add
to the real or effective power. Stored energy is being shuttled to and from the magnetic ﬁeld of an inductance
or the electric ﬁeld of a capacitance.
Example 18.5
An ac voltage with a rms value of 115 V is applied to a load impedance of R = 75  and XL = 38 
(Fig. 18-9a). Find the value of real power P, reactive power Q, apparent power S, and complex power S. Show the phasor
diagram and the power triangle.
Step 1.
Find P .
It makes no difference what angle is assigned to V, so we conveniently assign 0◦to voltage.

Example 18.6
A generator is to supply power to a welder, heater, and induction motor (Fig. 18-10). A capacitor is used
to supply reactive power for the welder and motor in order that the net load on the generator will have unity power factor.
Find the complex power and real or effective power that must be supplied by the generator, and the reactive power that
must be supplied by the capacitor. If the capacitor were not used, what apparent power would have to be supplied by the
generator?

Ans.
Q = 46.7 kVAR leading is the reactive power produced by the capacitor
to offset the inductive reactive power of 46.7 kVAR so that
the net reactive power Q = 0 and the PF = 1.

θ, so that apparent power VI is 90.3 kVA.
Ans.
In practice, a capacitor would not be used because it would be cheaper to increase the size of the generator
to supply 90.3 kVA than to buy a capacitor to supply 46.7 kVAR.
Example 18.7
Adding sufﬁcient capacitance to increase power factor to 1 may not be economical in the circuit shown
in Fig. 18-10, Example 18.6. What must be the capacitive reactance to achieve a power factor less than 1, say 0.90 lagging,
and what is the new apparent power?
Step 1.
Draw the power triangle from the values solved in Example 18.6, where
S = 90.3

31.1◦= 77.3 + j46.7 kVA
Without the capacitor, PF of the circuit = cos 31.1◦= 0.856 lagging.

Step 2.
Draw the desired power triangle where PF = 0.90 lagging.
PF1 = cos θ1 = 0.90 lagging
θ1 = arccos 0.90 = 25.8◦
Q1 = 77.3 tan 25.8◦= 37.4 kVAR
The new value of apparent power S1 = 77.3
cos θ1

0.90
= 85.9 kVA
Ans.
Step 3.
Draw the combined power triangle.
Q −Q1 is the reduction of Q lagging by adding a capacitor.
The capacitive reactance QC required to improve the PF is
Qc = Q −Q1 = 46.7 −37.4 = 9.3 kVAR leading
Ans.
Note that the addition of Q1 has improved the PF from 0.856 to 0.90. The decrease of apparent power from
90.3 kVA to 85.9 kVA, 4.4 kVA, is 4.9%. The transformers, the distribution system, and the utility company
attenuators are all noted in kVA or MVA. Thus an improvement in PF, with corresponding less kVA, releases
some of the generation and transmission capability that can serve other customers.
DETERMINANT SOLUTION FOR AC CIRCUITS
When reactances are present in networks which cannot be resolved into simple series–parallel circuits, we
can use the same determinant solution technique for ac networks as in dc networks.
Recall from Chapter 8 that in a two-mesh dc network, the resistance determinant  is
 =

R11
−R12
−R21
R22

The 1st column of net voltages, V1 in mesh 1, V2 in mesh 2, and V3 in mesh 3, replaces the 1st column of the
impedance determinant. NI2 and NI3 are similarly found by replacing the 2nd and 3nd column respectively by
the net voltages.

An ac bridge circuit (Fig. 18-14) can be used to measure inductance or capacitance in the same way that
a Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure resistance, as explained in Chapter 9. For measurement, two of the resistances
are varied until the galvanometer G in the center arm reads zero when the switch is closed. The bridge is then balanced,
and the unknown impedance ZX can be found by the bridge balance equation:
ZX = Z1Z3

This equation is the same as that for the Wheatstone bridge except for having Z’s instead of R’s. [Though no further

An ac power line of 110 V operates a parallel bank of lamps and a small induction motor (Fig. 18-24).
Find (a) the total effective power PT , (b) the total apparent power ST , (c) the total reactive power QT ,
(d) the total PF, and (e) the total current IT .
Fig. 18-24
Apparent power in branch A, SA, is not in phase with the apparent power in branch B, SB, since
they have different power factors. Thus, we must ﬁnd the complex power for branch A, SA, and for
branch B, SB, and then add them to obtain total power of the circuit, ST .
Step 1.
Find SA.
SA = VAIA = (110)(10) = 1100 VA
PA = SA cos θA = SA cos 0◦= (1100)(1) = 1100 W

A generator is in series with a ﬁxed impedance ZG and a load impedance ZL (Fig. 18-25). Maximum
power is transferred from the generator to the load by making the load resistance RL equal to the
generator resistance RG, RL = RG, and the load reactance XL (not to be confused with inductive
reactance) equal and opposite to the generator reactance XG, XL = −XG. In other words, make ZL
equal to the conjugate of ZG,
ZL = Z∗
G
(1)
Fig. 18-25
Maximum power transfer
In an actual circuit, ZG is the internal impedance of the generator plus the impedance of connecting
lines and any other elements in the circuit. If ZG were a pure resistance, ZL would be an equal
resistance in order to receive maximum power. If ZG were inductive, ZL would need to be capacitive.
It is clear that a load can be adjusted to receive maximum power only if its resistance and reactance
can both be varied independently. Impedance matching to obtain maximum power to the load is
important in practically all communication engineering. Though the conjugate match is the ideal,
in practice both generator impedance and load impedance are likely to be mainly resistive, and often
it is adequate to make their impedance equal in magnitude,
|ZL| = |ZG|
(2)
If a 120-V generator has an internal resistance of ZG = 4 + j3, ﬁnd (a) the load impedance ZL
for the maximum power to be transferred to the load, (b) the power PL delivered to the load, (c) the
power factor, and (d) the power efﬁciency of the circuit.

Ans.
(d)
Power efﬁciency = 900
1800 = 0.50 = 50%
Ans.
A matched load is always 50% efﬁcient, meaning that the load receives half the output from
the generator source, the other half dissipated by the generator resistance. This also means
that the terminal voltage drops to half when maximum load is applied. Neither of these
conditions is tolerable on a power system.

Transformers
IDEAL TRANSFORMER CHARACTERISTICS
The basic transformer consists of two coils electrically insulated from each other and wound upon a
common core (Fig. 19-1). Magnetic coupling is used to transfer electric energy from one coil to another. The
coil which receives energy from an ac source is called the primary. The coil which delivers energy to an ac
load is called the secondary. The core of transformers used at low frequencies is generally made of magnetic
material, usually sheet steel. Cores of transformers used at higher frequencies are made of powdered iron
and ceramics, or nonmagnetic materials. Some coils are simply wound on nonmagnetic hollow forms such as
cardboard or plastic so that the core material is actually air.
Fig. 19-1
Simple diagram of a transformer
If a transformer is assumed to be operating under an ideal or perfect condition, the transfer of energy from
one voltage to another is accompanied by no losses.
Voltage Ratio
The voltage on the coils of a transformer is directly proportional to the number of turns on the coils. This
relationship is expressed by the formula
Vp
Vs
= Np
Ns
(19-1)
where
Vp = voltage on primary coil, V
Vs = voltage on secondary coil, V
Np = number of turns on primary coil
Ns = number of turns on secondary coil
The ratio Vp/Vs is called the voltage ratio (VR). The ratio Np/Ns is called the turns ratio (TR). By substituting
these terms into Eq. (19-1), we obtain an equivalent formula
VR = TR
(19-2)
455

 
456
TRANSFORMERS
[CHAP. 19
A voltage ratio of 1 : 4 (read as 1 to 4) means that for each volt on the transformer primary, there is 4 V
on the secondary. When the secondary voltage is greater than the primary voltage, the transformer is called a
step-up transformer. A voltage ratio of 4 : 1 means that for each 4 V on the primary, there is only 1 V on the
secondary. When the secondary voltage is less than the primary voltage, the transformer is called a step-down
transformer.
Example 19.1
A ﬁlament transformer (Fig. 19-2) reduces the 120 V in the primary to 8 V on the secondary. If there are
150 turns on the primary and 10 turns on the secondary, ﬁnd the voltage ratio and turns ratio.

Current Ratio
The current in the coils of a transformer is inversely proportional to the voltage in the coils. This relationship
is expressed by the equation
Vp
Vs
= Is
Ip
(19-3)
where
Ip = current in primary coil, A
Is = current in secondary coil, A
From Eq. (19-1) we may substitute Np/Ns for Vp/Vs, so we have
Np
Ns
= Is
Ip
(19-4)
Example 19.4
Derive the current-ratio equation Vp/Vs = Is/Ip.
For an ideal transformer, the power input to the primary is equal to the power output of the secondary. Thus, an ideal
transformer is assumed to operate at an efﬁciency of 100 percent. Therefore,
Power input = power output
Pp = Ps
Power input = Pp = VpIp
Power output = Ps = VsIs
Substituting for Pp and Ps,
VpIp = VsIs

Efﬁciency
The efﬁciency of a transformer is equal to the ratio of the power output of the secondary winding to the
power input of the primary winding. An ideal transformer is 100 percent efﬁcient because it delivers all the
energy it receives. Because of core and copper losses, the efﬁciency of even the best practical transformer is
less than 100 percent. Expressed as an equation,
Eff = power output
power input = Ps
Pp
(19-5)
where
Eff = efﬁciency
Ps = power output from secondary, W
Pp = power input to primary, W

Eff = Ps
Pp
(19-5)

900 = 0.667 = 66.7%

the primary current.
Eff = Ps

Then
Eff = Ps

160 = 0.75 = 75%

TRANSFORMER RATINGS
Transformer capacity is rated in kilovoltamperes. Since power in an ac circuit depends on the power factor

Ans.
Since rated current is determined by the rated kilovoltamperage, the full-load current of 41.7 A is supplied by the transformer
at the three different PFs even though the kilowatt output is different for each case.
IMPEDANCE RATIO
A maximum amount of power is transferred from one circuit to another when the impedances of the two
circuits are equal or matched. If the two circuits have unequal impedances, a coupling transformer may be
used as an impedance-matching device between the two circuits. By constructing the transformer’s winding
so that it has a deﬁnite turns ratio, the transformer can perform any impedance-matching function. The turns
ratio establishes the proper relationship between the ratio of the primary and secondary winding impedances.

AUTOTRANSFORMER
An autotransformer is a special type of power transformer. It consists of only one winding. By tapping, or
connecting, at points along the length of the winding, different voltages may be obtained. The autotransformer
(Fig. 19-3) has a single winding between terminals A and C. The winding is tapped and a wire brought out
as terminal B. Winding AC is the primary while winding BC is the secondary. The simplicity of the auto-
transformer makes it economical and space-saving. However, it does not provide electrical isolation between
primary and secondary circuits.
Fig. 19-3
Autotransformer schematic diagram
Example 19.14
An autotransformer having 200 turns is connected to a 120-V line (Fig. 19-3). To obtain a 24-V output,
ﬁnd the number of turns of the secondary and the turn number at which the transformer should be tapped, counting from
terminal A.

120200 = 40 turns
Ans.
Since the secondary turns include primary, the B tap should be where the turn number is 160 (160 = 200 −40). If
tap B is made movable, the autotransformer becomes a variable transformer. As the tap is moved downward toward C, the
secondary voltage decreases.
TRANSFORMER LOSSES AND EFFICIENCY
Actual transformers have copper losses and core losses. Copper loss is the power lost in the primary
and secondary windings due to the ohmic resistance of the windings. Copper loss in watts is obtained by the
formula
Copper loss = I 2
pRp + I 2
s Rs
(19-8)

 
CHAP. 19]
TRANSFORMERS
461
where
Ip = primary current, A
Is = secondary current, A
Rp = resistance of the primary winding, 
Rs = resistance of the secondary winding, 
Core loss is caused by two factors: hysteresis loss and eddy-current loss. Hysteresis loss is the energy lost
by reversing the magnetic ﬁeld in the core as the magnetizing alternating current rises and falls and reverses
direction. Eddy-current loss is the result of induced currents circulating in the core material.
Copper loss in both windings may be measured by means of a wattmeter. The wattmeter is placed in the
primary circuit of the transformer while the secondary is short-circuited. The voltage applied to the primary
is then increased until the rated full-load current is ﬂowing in the short-circuited secondary. At that point the
wattmeter will read the total copper loss. Core loss may be determined also by a wattmeter in the primary
circuit by applying the rated voltage to the primary with the secondary circuit open.
The efﬁciency of an actual transformer is expressed as follows:
Eff = power output
power input = Ps
Pp
(19-5)
=
power output
power output + copper loss + core loss
and
Eff =
VsIs × PF
(VsIs × PF) + copper loss + core loss
(19-9)
where
PF = power factor of the load
Example 19.15
A 10 : 1 step-down 5-kVA transformer has a full-load secondary current rating of 50 A. A short-circuit
test for copper loss at a full load gives a wattmeter reading of 100 W. If the resistance of the primary winding is 0.6 ,
ﬁnd the resistance of the secondary winding and the power loss in the secondary.
Use Eq. (19-8).

Ans.
NO-LOAD CONDITION
If the secondary winding of a transformer is left open-circuited (Fig. 19-4a), the primary current is very
low and is referred to as the no-load current. The no-load current produces the magnetic ﬂux and supplies the
hysteresis and eddy-current losses in the core. Therefore, the no-load current IE consists of two components:
the magnetizing-current component IM and the core-loss component IH. The magnetizing current IM lags the
applied primary voltage Vp by 90◦, while the core-loss component IH is always in phase with Vp (Fig. 19-4b).
Note also that the primary applied voltage Vp and the induced secondary voltage Vs are shown 180◦out of
phase with each other. Since in practice IH is small in comparison with IM, the magnetizing current IM is
very nearly equal to the total no-load current IE. IE is also called the exciting current.

The symbol for a transformer gives no indication of the phase of the voltage across the secondary since the
phase of that voltage actually depends on the direction of the windings around the core. To solve this problem,
polarity dots are used to indicate the phase of primary and secondary signals. The voltages are either in phase
(Fig. 19-6a) or 180◦out of phase with respect to the primary voltage (Fig. 19-6b).

Three-Phase Systems
CHARACTERISTICS OF THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
A three-phase (3-φ) system is a combination of three single-phase (1-φ) systems. In a 3-φ balanced system,
the power comes from an ac generator that produces three separate but equal voltages, each of which is out of
phase with the other voltages by 120◦(Fig. 20-1). Although 1-φ circuits are widely used in electrical systems,
most generation and distribution of alternating current is 3-φ. Three-phase circuits require less weight of con-
ductors than 1-φ circuits of the same power rating; they permit ﬂexibility in the choice of voltages; and they
can be used for single-phase loads. Also, 3-φ equipment is smaller in size, lighter in weight, and more efﬁcient
than 1-φ machinery of the same rated capacity. The three phases of a 3-φ system may be connected in two
ways. If the three common ends of each phase are connected together at a common terminal marked N for
neutral, and the other three ends are connected to the 3-φ line, the system is wye- or Y-connected (Fig. 20-2a).
If the three phases are connected in series to form a closed loop, the system is delta- or ∆-connected
(Fig. 20-2b).

THREE-PHASE TRANSFORMER CONNECTIONS
Three-phase transformers may consist of three separate but identical 1-φ transformers or a single 3-φ unit
containing three-phase windings. The transformer’s windings (three in the primary and three in the secondary)
may be connected to form a 3-φ bank in any one of four common ways (Fig. 20-3). Each primary winding is
matched to the secondary winding drawn parallel to it.
Fig. 20-3
Common 3-φ transformer connections. The transformer windings are indicated by the heavy lines. a = N1/N2
Shown are the voltages and currents in terms of the applied primary line-to-line voltage V and line
current I, where a = N1/N2, the ratio of the number of primary to secondary turns. A line voltage is a
voltage between two lines, while a phase voltage is a voltage across a transformer winding. A line current
is a current in one of the lines, while a phase current is a current in the transformer winding. Voltage and
current ratings of the individual transformers depend on the connections shown (Fig. 20-3) and are indicated in
tabular form (Table 20-1) for convenience in calculations. Ideal transformers are assumed. The kilovoltampere
rating of each transformer is one-third of the kilovoltampere rating of the bank, regardless of the transformer
connections used.
Example 20.1
If the line voltage V is 2200 V to a 3-φ transformer bank, ﬁnd the voltage across each transformer
primary winding for all four types of transformer connection. Refer to Fig. 20-3 and Table 20-1.

POWER IN BALANCED THREE-PHASE LOADS
A balanced load has identical impedance in each secondary winding (Fig. 20-4). The impedance of each
winding in the ∆load is shown equal to Z∆(Fig. 20-4a), and in the Y load equal to ZY (Fig. 20-4b). For
either connection, the lines A, B, and C provide a three-phase system of voltages. The neutral point N in the
Y-connection is the fourth conductor of the three-phase four-wire system.
Fig. 20-4
Three-phase balanced load types
In a balanced ∆-connected load (Fig. 20-4a), as well as in the windings of a transformer, the line voltage
VL and the winding or phase voltages Vp are equal, and the line current IL is
√
3 times the phase current Ip.
That is,
∆-load:
VL = Vp
(20-1)
IL =
√
3Ip
(20-2)
For a balanced Y-connected load (Fig. 20-4b), the line current IL and the winding or phase current Ip are
equal, the neutral current IN is zero, and the line voltage VL is
√
3 times the phase voltage Vp. That is,

IN = 0
(20-4)
VL =

3Vp
(20-5)
(These relationships are also observed in Fig. 20-3 and Table 20-1.)
Since the phase impedance of balanced Y or ∆loads have equal currents, the phase power or power of
one phase is one-third the total power. Phase power Pp is
Pp = VpIp cos θ
(20-6)
and total power PT is
PT = 3VpIp cos θ
(20-7)
Since VL = Vp [Eq. (20-1)] and Ip =
√
3IL/3 from Eq. (20-2), for a balanced ∆load,
∆load:
PT =
√
3VLIL cos θ
(20-8)
Since IL = Ip [Eq. (20-3)] and Vp =
√
3VL/3 from Eq. (20-5), for balanced Y loads, substitution in
Eq. (20-7) gives
Y load:
PT =
√
3VLIL cos θ
(20-8)
Thus the total-power formulas for ∆and Y loads are identical. θ is the phase angle between the voltage and
current of the load impedance, so cos θ is the power factor of the load.
The total apparent power ST in voltamperes and the total reactive power QT in voltamperes reactive are
related to total real power PT in watts (Fig. 20-5). Therefore, a balanced three-phase load has the real power,
apparent power, and reactive power given by the equations

UNBALANCED THREE-PHASE LOADS
A very important property of a 3-φ balanced system is that the phasor sum of the three line (or phase)
voltages is zero and the phasor sum of the three line (or phase) currents is zero. When the three load impedances
are not equal to each other, the phasor sum and the neutral current IN are not zero, and we have an unbalanced
load. An imbalance occurs when an open or short circuit appears at the load.
If a 3-φ system has an unbalanced power source and an unbalanced load, the methods for solving them
are complex. We will consider an unbalanced load only with a balanced source.
Example 20.10
Consider a balanced 3-φ system (Fig. 20-11a) with a Y load. The line-to-line voltage is 173 V and

Delta-connected secondaries are generally used for three-phase three-wire loads. Show how a ∆
connection can be used to supply single-phase loads at two terminal voltages as well as three-phase
loads.
A four-wire system is obtained by adding a fourth wire from the midpoint of one of the three
∆transformer windings (Fig. 20-17). The normal voltage is 240 V from phase to phase and 120 V
from the neutral (or midphase) wire to each of the phasor conductors connected to the winding ends.
With this system, single-phase loads are fed from 120-V terminals; and three-phase loads as well as
single-phase loads are fed from the 240-V phase terminals A, B, and C.

Step 2.
Find the total kilovoltampere load and then the required kilovoltampere rating of the

In order to ﬁnd the P and Q components of the motor load with PF = 0.8, we use
relationships of the power triangle (Fig. 20-18b).
P = S cos θ = 30(0.8) = 24 kW

If the transformer bank of Problem 20.7 is rated at 150 kVA, ﬁnd the full-load current on the high
side and on the low side.
The low-side (secondary) voltage is given as 208 V.
Kilovoltampere load =
√
3VLIL = 150 kVA
(20-9)
Low side:
IL = 150(1000)
√
3VL
=
150 000
1.73(208) = 417 A
Ans.
The high-side (primary) voltage is the product of the turns ratio and the corresponding winding voltage
on the low side (secondary), which is the phase voltage Vp. So
VL = 100(120) = 12 000 V
and, assuming ideal transformers without losses, on the high side
Kilovoltampere load =
√
3VLIL = 150 kVA
(20-9)
High side:
IL = 150(1000)
√
3VL
=
150 000
1.73(12 000) = 7.23 A
Ans.
Since maximum currents are present under full-load conditions, the cables connected to the high- and
low-voltage windings of the transformers would be sized according to these currents.

Series and Parallel Resonance
We have observed that in many circuits inductors and capacitors are connected in series or in parallel.
Such circuits are often referred to as RLC circuits. One of the most important characteristics of an RLC circuit
is that it can be made to respond most effectively to a single given frequency. When operated in this condition,
the circuit is said to be in resonance with or resonant to the operating frequency.
A series or a parallel RLC circuit that is operated at resonance has certain properties that allow it to
respond selectively to certain frequencies while rejecting others. A circuit operated to provide frequency
selectivity is called a tuned circuit. Tuned circuits are used in impedance matching, bandpass ﬁlters, and
oscillators.

The RLC series circuit (Fig. 21-1a) has an impedance Z =

R2 + (XL −XC)2. The circuit is at resonance
when the inductive reactance XL is equal to the capacitive reactance XC (Fig. 21-1b).

For any LC product [Eq. (21-1)] there is only one resonant frequency. Thus, various combinations of
L and C may be used to achieve resonance if the LC product remains the same. Equation (21-1) may be
solved for L or C to ﬁnd the inductance or capacitance needed to form a series resonant circuit at a given
frequency.

Since XL = XC, XL −XC = 0 so that
Z =

R2 + (XL −XC)2 =

R2 = R
Since the impedance at resonance Z equals the resistance R, the impedance is a minimum. With minimum
impedance, the circuit has maximum current determined by I = V/R. The resonant circuit has a phase angle
equal to 0◦so that the power factor is unity.
At frequencies below the resonant frequency (Fig. 21-2a), XC is greater than XL so the circuit consists of
resistance and capacitive reactance. However, at frequencies above the resonant frequency (Fig. 21-2a), XL is
greater than XC so the circuit consists of resistance and inductive reactance. At resonance, maximum current
is produced for different values of resistance (Fig. 21-2b). With a low resistance, the current increases sharply
toward and decreases sharply from its maximum current as the circuit is tuned to and away from the resonant
frequency. This condition where the curve is narrow at the resonant frequency provides good selectivity. With
an increase of resistance, the curve broadens so that selectivity is less.

A voltage of 15-V ac is applied to a 150-µH coil connected in series with a 169-pF capacitor (Fig. 21-4).

Thus we see that the voltage drops across both the inductance and the capacitance are 125 times greater than the
applied voltage. Since at resonance the high reactive voltages VL and VC cancel each other, they have no effect
on the load. However, the insulation of the coil connectors and the dielectric of the capacitor must be designed
to withstand a voltage about 125 times greater than the applied voltage.

Q OF SERIES CIRCUIT
The degree to which a series-tuned circuit is selective is proportional to the ratio of its inductive reactance
to its resistance. This ratio XL/R is known as the Q of the circuit and is expressed as follows:
Q = XL
R
(21-4)
where
Q = quality factor or ﬁgure of merit
XL = inductive reactance, 
R
= resistance, 
The lower the reactance, the higher the value of Q. The higher the Q, the sharper and more selective is the
resonant curve. Q has the same value if calculated with XC instead of XL since they are equal at resonance.
Q = 150 is a high Q. Typical values are 50 to 250. Less than 10 is a low Q; more than 300 is a very high Q.
See Fig. 21-2b.
The Q of the circuit is generally considered in terms of XL since the coil has the series resistance of the
circuit. In this case, the Q of the coil and the Q of the series resonant circuit are the same. If extra resistance
is added, the Q of the circuit will be less than the Q of the coil. The highest possible Q for the circuit is the
Q of the coil.
The Q of the resonant circuit can be considered a magniﬁcation factor that determines how much the
voltage across L or C is increased by the resonant rise of current in a series circuit.
VL = VC = QVT

Use Eq. (21-5) to ﬁnd VL or VC.

This is the same value calculated for VL or VC at resonance in Example 21.3.
PARALLEL RESONANCE
Pure Parallel LC Circuit
In the pure LC parallel-tuned circuit (that is, one in which there is no resistance), the coil and capacitor
are placed in parallel and the applied voltage VT appears across these circuit components (Fig. 21-5a). In this
parallel-tuned circuit, as in the series-tuned circuit, resonance occurs when the inductive reactance is equal to
the capacitive reactance.
XL = XC

VL = VC
so that
VL

IL = IC

SERIES AND PARALLEL RESONANCE
[CHAP. 21
The current in the inductive branch IL equals the current in the capacitive branch IC. IL lags the applied voltage
VT by 90◦, while IC leads the voltage by 90◦(Fig. 21-5b). Since the phasor currents IL and IC are equal and
out of phase by 180◦, their vector sum is zero so that the total current IT is zero. Under this condition, the
impedance of the circuit at the resonant frequency must be inﬁnite in value.

Practical Parallel LC Circuit
In a practical LC parallel-tuned circuit (Fig. 21-6a), there is some resistance, most of which is due to the
resistance of the inductor wire. The resonant frequency of a parallel circuit also is deﬁned as that frequency
at which the parallel circuit acts as a pure resistance. Therefore, the line current IT must be in phase with
the applied voltage VT (unity power factor) (Fig. 21-6b). This means that the out-of-phase or quadrature
component of the current through the inductive branch IL must be equal to the current through the capacitive
branch IC; and the total line current IT equals the in-phase component of the current through the inductive
branch, or IT = IR (Fig. 21-6b). Since the impedance is maximum, IT is minimum.

If the Q of the coil is high, say greater than 10, or the term 1/LC ≫R2/L2, then, for practical purposes,
the term R2/L2 can be disregarded. The result is that Eq. (21-6) becomes Eq. (21-1), the resonant-frequency

(21-9)
The impedance ZT of a practical parallel circuit is maximum at the resonant frequency and decreases
at frequencies below and above the resonant frequency (Fig. 21-7a). An increase in resistance decreases the
impedance and causes the impedance to vary less “sharply” as the circuit is tuned over a band of frequencies
below and above the resonant frequency (Fig. 21-7b). At frequencies below resonance, XC > XL and IL > IC
so that the parallel-tuned circuit is inductive (Figs. 21-7a and c). At frequencies above resonance, the reverse
condition is true, XL > XC and IC > IL, so that now the circuit is capacitive (Figs. 21-7a and c). Since the
impedance ZT is maximum at parallel resonance, IT is minimum (Fig. 21-7c).

BANDWIDTH AND POWER OF RESONANT CIRCUIT
The width of the resonant band of frequencies centered around fr is called the bandwidth of the tuned
circuit. In Fig. 21-9a, the group of frequencies with a response equal to 70.7 percent or more of maximum is
considered the bandwidth of the tuned circuit. For a series resonant circuit, the bandwidth is measured between
the two edge frequencies f1 and f2, producing 70.7 percent of the maximum current at fr (Fig. 21-9b). For
a parallel resonant circuit, the bandwidth is measured between the two frequencies, allowing 70.7 percent of
the maximum total impedance at fr (Fig. 21-9c).
Fig. 21-9
Bandwidth of a tuned LC circuit
At each frequency f1 and f2, the net capacitive or net inductive reactance equals the resistance. Then ZT
of the series RLC resonant circuit is
√
2 or 1.4 times greater than R. The current then is I/
√
2 = 0.707 I.
Since power is I2R or V 2/R and (0.707)2 = 0.50, the bandwidth at 70.7 percent response in current or voltage
is also the bandwidth of half-power points.
Bandwidth (BW) in terms of Q is
BW = f2 −f1 = f = fr
Q
(21-10)
High Q means narrow bandwidth, whereas low Q yields greater bandwidth (Fig. 21-10).

In this case XC > XL (796  > 628 ) so that the circuit is inductive (more inductive current than

A simpler method for evaluating ZT when R ≪XL, R ≪XC, and R ≪X is by reducing the for-

RL SERIES CIRCUIT WAVEFORMS
When a switch S is closed in a circuit having only resistance R (Fig. 22-1a), the readings on the ammeter A
and the voltmeter V both rise quickly to a value and remain steady at that value (Fig. 22-1b and c). If the
resistance R and the current I are known, the voltage V can be found by Ohm’s law,
V = IR
(22-1)
When switch S is opened, the current and voltage drop quickly to zero.
Fig. 22-1
Response of circuit with R only
When a coil of wire is added in series with a resistor, we have an RL series circuit (Fig. 22-2a), where
V is the dc voltage, i is the instantaneous current, vR is the instantaneous voltage across the resistor, and vL is
the instantaneous voltage across the coil. When the switch S is closed, the current begins to rise rapidly from
zero until it reaches a steady value I determined by the resistance R of the circuit and the dc voltage V of
the source (Fig. 22-2b). The shape that the current curve takes is exponential. When the switch is opened, the
voltage source is removed and the current decays to zero at an exponential rate (Fig. 22-2b). With regard to
voltage waveforms across R and L, when the switch is closed, the full dc voltage V appears across the coil

and vL decays to zero at an exponential rate; and vR begins at zero and rises exponentially to a steady value
of V (Fig. 22-2c). When the switch is opened, the net series voltage across R and L, vR + vL, must equal
zero. Because vR cannot change quickly, vL drops to −V and decays to 0 V (Fig. 22-2c).
The term exponential is used to describe the current and voltage waveforms because the formulas for
calculating i, vR, and vL when time t is given contain an exponent of e (constant equal to 2.718).
The speciﬁc formulas to describe the RL waveforms follow:

Any value of t can be inserted in the formula for current [Eq. (22-2)], and a corresponding value of the
current i can be found. Theoretically, the current never reaches the steady-state value of V/R on rise, zero, or
decay. However, from a practical standpoint, the ammeter does show steady current values, a ﬁnite number of
seconds after the circuit is closed or opened.

A convenient unit of time measurement is the time constant T , which is equal to the ratio L/R in an
RL circuit.

We say that
One time constant = 1T = L
R
Two time constants = 2T = 2L

and so on.
By substituting one time constant, t = 1T = L/R, in Eq. (22-2),
i = V

(22-2)
we obtain
i = V
R (1 −e−(R/L)(L/R))
or
i = V
R (1 −e−1)
Since
e−1 = 0.368
then
i = V
R (1 −0.368) = (0.632)V
R
Therefore, one time constant is the time in seconds required for the current in an RL circuit to rise to
0.632 times its steady-state value V/R, or at t = L/R the current is 63.2 percent of its ﬁnal value.
Table 22-1 shows the value of the quantities e−Rt/L and 1 −e−Rt/L for the number of time constants

The table shows that the current reaches more than 99 percent (0.993) of its steady-state value in ﬁve time
constants. Since the rise during the sixth time constant is only 0.005 (0.998−0.993), the current is considered,
from a practical standpoint, to have reached its steady-state value at the end of ﬁve time constants.
Example 22.4
A circuit has total resistance of 10  and an inductance of 50 H. In how many seconds will the current
reach its steady-state value?
Write the formula for a time constant [Eq. (22-12)] and substitute L = 50 H and R = 10 .
T = L/R = 50/10 = 5 s, one time constant
The total time to reach the steady-state value is equal to ﬁve time constants.
Total time = 5T = 5(5) = 25 s
Ans.
Example 22.5
Draw a plot of a rising current versus time constants in an RL series circuit.
Refer to Table 22-1 for values of 1 −e−Rt/L or 1 −e−t/T and the corresponding time constants. The plot is shown
in Fig. 22-5. Compare the similarity of this plot with that in Fig. 22-4b of Example 22.2d, where V/R = 6 A and one
time constant equals L/R = 20/20 = 1 s. In that example, therefore, the horizontal scale of time is the same as that
of time constants for this example. To illustrate, at t = 4 s, i = 5.89 A (Fig. 22-4b); in this example, t = 4 = T , so
i = 0.982(V/R) = 0.982(6) = 5.89 A.

RC SERIES CIRCUIT WAVEFORMS
When a capacitor is added in series with a resistor, we have the RC series circuit (Fig. 22-6a), where V is
the dc voltage, i is the instantaneous current, vR is the instantaneous voltage across the resistor, and vC is the
instantaneous voltage across the capacitor.
When switch S1 is closed and switch S2 is opened, the current rises instantly to its maximum value of
V/R and then decays exponentially until it reaches zero, its steady-state or ﬁnal value (Fig. 22-6b). Also, the
full voltage V of the battery is across the resistor, V = VR. As the current decreases, the voltage across the
resistance vR decreases and the voltage across the capacitance vC rises so that the sum of the voltages vR and
vC is equal to V ; vR reduces to zero and the capacitor charges to vC = V (Fig. 22-6c).
After steady-state conditions are reached (i = 0, vR = 0, vC = V ), switch S1 is opened and switch S2
is closed. Current now ﬂows out of the capacitor in the direction opposite to the direction it ﬂowed while the
capacitor was being charged. The current drops instantly to −V/R and gradually decays to zero (Fig. 22-6b).

Also, the voltage V across the capacitor cannot change instantly, so voltage V appears across the resistance
with opposite polarity, that of −V (Fig. 22-6c). Then the two voltages vR and vC decay exponentially to zero.

We say that
One time constant = 1T = RC
Two time constants = 2T = 2RC
Three time constants = 3T = 3RC
and so on.
The time constant of a capacitive circuit is usually very short because the capacitance of a circuit may be
only a few microfarads or even picofarads.
Voltage and current values in capacitive circuits are assumed to reach their steady-state or ﬁnal values
after ﬁve time constants, just as in inductive circuits. Table 22-1 applies also to capacitive circuits if e−Rt/L is
replaced by e−t/RC.

An RL circuit (Fig. 22-9) is used to generate a high voltage to light a neon bulb, which requires 90 V
for ionization at which time it glows. When the circuit is open, the high resistance R2 produces a low
time constant L/R so that the current drops toward zero much faster than the rise of current when the
switch is closed. The result is a high value of self-induced voltage across a coil when the RL circuit is
open. This voltage can be greater than the applied voltage. (a) Find the time constants of the circuit
when the switch is opened and when the switch is closed. (b) When the switch is closed, ﬁnd the
voltage across the neon bulb. Is it sufﬁcient to start ionization? (c) When the switch is open, what is

When the switch is open, there is a much shorter time constant for current decay. The current
decays practically to zero after ﬁve time constants, or 2.5 ms.
(b)
When the switch is closed, there is 10 V across the neon bulb, which is far less than the 90 V
needed to ionize it to glow.
(c)
When the switch is closed, R2 is short-circuited so that the 100- R1 is the only resistance.
The steady-state current I = V/R1 = 10/100 = 0.10 A. When the switch is opened, the rapid
drop in current results in a magnetic ﬁeld collapsing at a fast rate, inducing a high voltage across
L. The energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld maintains I at 0.10 A for an instant before the current
decays. With 0.10 A in the 4-k R2, its potential difference is 0.10(4000) = 400 V. This 400-V
pulse is sufﬁcient to light the bulb.

An RC series circuit with a rectangular pulse input is shown (Fig. 22-13). A rectangular pulse is

When t = 0.5 ms,
vR = 10e−0.5/1 = 10e−0.5 = 10(0.607) = 6.07 V
Ans.
When t = 1 ms,
vR = 10e−1/1 = 10e−1 = 10(0.368) = 3.68 V
Ans.
At t = 1 ms, the pulse is turned off. At that instant the source voltage is zero, so
vR + vC = 0
vR = −vC
Since the voltage across the capacitor vC cannot change instantly, the voltage across the resistor
becomes −vC. Now at an instant before t = 1 ms,
vR + vC = 10
vC = 10 −vR = 10 −3.68 = 6.32 V
Therefore, at t = 1 ms, vR = −vC = −6.32 V and then vR decays to zero. So the formula for vR at
t = 1 ms is:
vR = −6.32e−t/RC
Then in the next 1 ms or when t = 2 ms measured from the origin,
vR = −6.32e−1 = −6.32(0.368) = −2.33 V
Ans.
The plot for vR is as shown in Fig. 22-14.

RC circuit with square wave for input voltage
Find some values of vR within the 0 to 1 ms that the pulse is on, say at T = 0.1 ms, 2T = 0.2 ms,
and 3T = 0.3 ms. First, write the formula for vR when the circuit is charging.
vR = V e−t/RC
(22-16)
When t = T = 0.1 ms,
vR = 10e−1 = 10(0.368) = 3.68 V
When t = 2T = 0.2 ms,
vR = 10e−2 = 10(0.135) = 1.35 V
When t = 3T = 0.3 ms,
vR = 10e−3 = 10(0.05) = 0.5 V
At t = 5T or 0.5 ms, vR will reach its steady-state value of 0 V.
When the pulse is turned off between 1 and 2 ms, vR will instantly drop to −10 V because the
capacitor charged to 10 V requires a ﬁnite time to discharge. Then vR will gradually rise to 0 V.
The formula for vR when the circuit is discharging is
vR = −V e−t/RC
(22-21)
where t represents time from 1 to 2 ms. So when t = 1.1 ms from origin,
vR = −3.68 V
When t = 1.2 ms,
vR = −1.35 V
When t = 1.3 ms,
vR = −0.5 V
When t = 1.5 ms,
vR = 0 V
The symmetry of the output curve is shown in the plot (Fig. 22-16). Because the circuit has changed
the waveform of input pulses to peaks, it is called an RC peaker. It is called also a differentiating
circuit because vR can change instantaneously. We obtain a peak output when the circuit time constant
is small compared with the half-period of the input waveform. In this case T = 0.1 ms compared
with the half-period of 1 ms, so the ratio of the time constant to the half-period is 1 to 10.
In summary, to explain a short RC time circuit, a 10-V input is applied for 1 ms (10 time
constants of the RC circuit), allowing C to become completely charged and vR to be 0 V (Figs. 22-15
and 22-16). After C is charged, vC remains at 10 V with vR at 0 V (V = vC + vR). After 1 ms,
the total voltage V drops to zero, C discharges completely in ﬁve time constants, and vC and
vR remain at 0 V while there is no applied voltage. On the next cycle, C charges and discharges
