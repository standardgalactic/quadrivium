Preface
Preface
 
Worked examples are a necessary element to any textbook in the sciences, because they reinforce the 
theory (i.e. the principles, concepts and methods). Once the theory has been understood, well chosen 
examples can be used, with modification, as a template to solve more complex, or similar problems. 
 
This work book contains examples and full solutions to go with the text of our e-book (Heat Transfer, 
by Long and Sayma). The subject matter corresponds to the five chapters of our book: Introduction to 
Heat Transfer, Conduction, Convection, Heat Exchangers and Radiation. They have been carefully 
chosen with the above statement in mind. Whilst compiling these examples we were very much aware 
of the need to make them relevant to mechanical engineering students. Consequently many of the 
problems are taken from questions that have or may arise in a typical design process. The level of 
difficulty ranges from the very simple to challenging. Where appropriate, comments have been added 
which will hopefully allow the reader to occasionally learn something extra. We hope you benefit 
from following the solutions and would welcome your comments.

A plate 0.3 m long and 0.1 m wide, with a thickness of 12 mm is made from stainless steel (
K


), the top surface is exposed to an airstream of temperature 20oC. In an experiment, 
the plate is heated by an electrical heater (also 0.3 m by 0.1 m) positioned on the underside of the plate and 
the temperature of the plate adjacent to the heater is maintained at 100oC. A voltmeter and ammeter are 
connected to the heater and these read 200 V and 0.25 A, respectively. Assuming that the plate is 
perfectly insulated on all sides except the top surface, what is the convective heat transfer coefficient? 
 
 
 
Solution 
 
Heat flux equals power supplied to electric heater divided by the exposed surface area:

For the plain pipe, the heat loss is governed by the convective heat transfer coefficient on the outside, 
which provides the highest thermal resistance. For the insulated pipe, the insulation provides the 
higher thermal resistance and this layer governs the overall heat loss. 
 
Example 2.4 
 
Water at 80oC is pumped through 100 m of stainless steel pipe, k = 16 W/m K of inner and outer radii 
47 mm and 50 mm respectively. The heat transfer coefficient due to water is 2000 W/m2 K. The outer 
surface of the pipe loses heat by convection to air at 20oC and the heat transfer coefficient is 200 W/m2 
K. Calculate the heat flow through the pipe. Also calculate the heat flow through the pipe when a layer 
of insulation, k = 0.1 W/m K and 50 mm radial thickness is wrapped around the pipe. 
 
Solution 
 
The equation for heat flow through a pipe per unit length was developed in Example 2.3:

Notice that with insulation, the thermal resistance of the insulator dominates the heat flow, so in the equation

This has less than 1% error compared with the full thermal resistance.  
 
Example 2.5 
 
A diagram of a heat sink to be used in an electronic application is shown below. There are a total of 9 
aluminium fins (k = 175 W/m K, C = 900 J/kg K,

) of rectangular cross-section, 
each 60 mm long, 40 mm wide and 1 mm thick. The spacing between adjacent fins, s, is 3 mm. The 
temperature of the base of the heat sink has a maximum design value of
C

, when the external 
air temperature 
f
T is 20oC. Under these conditions, the external heat transfer coefficient h is 12 W/m2 
K. The fin may be assumed to be sufficiently thin so that the heat transfer from the tip can be 
neglected. The surface temperature T, at a distance, x, from the base of the fin is given by:

Example 2.7 
 
The figure below shows part of a set of radial aluminium fins (k = 180 W/m K) that are to be fitted to 
a small air compressor. The device dissipates 1 kW by convecting to the surrounding air which is at 
20oC. Each fin is 100 mm long, 30 mm high and 5 mm thick. The tip of each fin may be assumed to be 
adiabatic and a heat transfer coefficient of h = 15 W/m2 K acts over the remaining surfaces. 
 
Estimate the number of fins required to ensure the base temperature does not exceed 120oC

Example 2.9 
 
A design of an apartment block at a ski resort requires a balcony projecting from each of the 350 
separate apartments. The walls of the building are 0.3 m wide and made from a material with k = 1 
W/m K. Use the fin approximation to examine the implications on the heat transfer for two separate 
suggestions for this design. In each case, the balcony projects 2 m from the building and has a length 
(parallel to the wall) of 4 m. Assume an inside temperature of 20oC and an outside temperature of -
5oC; the overall (convective + radiative) heat transfer coefficient on the inside of the building is 8 
W/m2 K and on that on the outside of the building is 20 W/m2 K 
 
a) A balcony constructed from solid concrete and built into the wall, 0.2 m thick, k = 2 W/m K. 
b) A balcony suspended from 3 steel beams, k = 40 W/m K, built into the wall and projecting out by 2

Comments: 
 

Nu is based on convective heat flux; sometimes the contribution of radiation can be significant 
and must be allowed for. 

The value of k is the definition of  Nu is the fluid (not solid surface property). 

Use of appropriate boundary layer growth that characterises length scale.

a)
Show that the local heat transfer coefficient is independent of the surface to air temperature 
difference in forced convection, whereas in free convection, h, depends upon (Ts  T)m 
 
b)
In turbulent free convection, it is generally recognised that m = 1/3. Show that the local heat 
transfer coefficient does not vary with coordinate x.

Convection
Example 3.7 
 
The side of a building of height H = 7 m and length W = 30 m is made entirely of glass. Estimate the 
heat loss through this glass (ignore the thermal resistance of the glass) when the temperature of the air 
inside the building is 20C, the outside air temperature is -15C and a wind of 15 m/s blows parallel to 
the side of the building.  Select the appropriate correlations from those listed below of local Nusselt 
numbers to estimate the average heat transfer coefficients. For air take: ρ= 1.2 kg / m3, μ = 1.8 x 10-5 
kg / m s, Cp = 1 kJ / kg K and Pr = 0.7. 
 

Free convection in air, laminar (Grx < 109): Nux = 0.3 Grx


Free convection in air, turbulent (Grx > 109): Nux = 0.09 Grx


Forced convection, laminar (Rex < 105): Nux = 0.33 Rex

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The figure below shows part of a heat exchanger tube. Hot water flows through the 20 mm diameter 
tube and is cooled by fins which are positioned with their longest side vertical. The fins exchange heat 
by convection to the surrounds that are at 27C. 
 
Estimate the convective heat loss per fin for the following conditions. You may ignore the contribution 
and effect of the cut-out for the tube on the flow and heat transfer. 
 
a)
natural convection, with an average fin surface temperature of 47C; 
b)
forced convection with an air flow of 15 m / s blowing parallel to the shortest side of the fin and 
with an average fin surface temperature of 37C.

The following correlations may be used without proof, although you must give reasons in support of 
your choice in the answer. 
 
Nux = 0.3 Rex
1/2 Pr1/3 
Rex < 3 x 105 
Nux = 0.02 Rex
0.8 Pr1/3 Rex   3 x 105 
Nux = 0.5 Grx
1/4 Pr1/4 
 
Grx < 109 
Nux = 0.1 Grx
1/3 Pr1/3 
 
Grx   109 
 
For air at these conditions, take: Pr = 0.7, k = 0.02 W / m K, μ = 1.8 x 10-5 kg /m s and ρ = 1.0 kg / m3 
 
Solution 
 
 
On the outside of the water tube, natural convections means that we need to evaluate Gr number to see 
if flow is laminar ot turbulent

Example 3.10 
A printed circuit board dissipates 100 W from one side over an area 0.3m by 0.2m. A fan is used to 
cool this board with a flow speed of 12 m / s parallel to the longest dimension of the board. Using the 
average Nusselt number relationship given in Example 3.9 to this question, calculate the surface 
temperature of the board for an air temperature of 30 ºC.  
 
Take an ambient pressure of 1 bar, R = 287 J / kg K,  
 
Cp = 1 kJ / kg K, k = 0.03 W / m K and μ = 2 x 10-5 kg/m s

Example 4.2 
 
Two adjacent compressor discs (Surfaces 1 and 2) each of 0.4 m diameter are bounded at the periphery 
by a 0.1 wide shroud (Surface 3). 
 
a)
Given that F12 = 0.6, calculate all the other view factors for this configuration.  
 
b)
The emissivity and temperature of Surfaces 1 and 2 are 1 = 0.4, T1 = 800 K, 2 = 0.3, T2 = 700K 
and Surface 3 can be treated as radiatively black with a temperature of T3 = 900 K. Apply a grey 
body radiation analysis to Surface 1 and to Surface 2 and show that:

Example 4.3 
 
The figure below shows a simplified representation of gas flame inside a burner unit. The gas flame is 
modelled as a cylinder of radius r1 = 10 mm (Surface 1). The burner comprises Surface 2 (a cylinder of 
radius r2 = 40 mm and height h = 40 mm), concentric with Surface 1 and a concentric base (Surface 3), 
of radius r3 = 40 mm. The end of the cylinder, Surface 4, opposite to the base is open to the 
surrounding environment. 
 
a)
Given that F21 = 0.143 and F22 = 0.445 use the dimensions indicated on the diagram to calculate 
all the other relevant view factors.  
 
b)
The flame, base and surroundings can be represented as black bodies at constant temperatures T1, 
T3 and T4, respectively. The emissivity of the inside of Surface 2 is ε2 = 0.5. Apply a grey body 
radiation analysis to Surface 2 and show that the radiosity is given by:

The temperatures T1 and T3 are found to be: T1 = 1800K and T3 = 1200K, and the surrounds are at 
500 K. Estimate the temperature T2, using a radiative heat balance on the outer surface of Surface 
2, where the emissivity is ε0 = 0.8

head (Surface 1), piston crown (Surface 2) and cylinder liner (Surface 3). 
 
a)
Using the dimensions indicated on the diagram, and given that F12 = 0.6, calculate all the other 
relevant view factors.

, so net flux is into the piston crown. 
 
c)
To make the analysis more realistic, it needs to be extended by including convection from the 
piston crown, and cylinder liner. Radiation from the piston underside also needs to be included. 
We then carry out analysis over a complete engine cycle. 
 
Example 4.5 
 
The figure below shows the variation of view factor Fi,j with geometric parametres h / L and W / L for 
the case of two rectangular surfaces at right angles to each other. This plot is to be used to model the 
radiative heat transfer between a turbocharger housing and the casing of an engine management 
system. The horizontal rectangle, W = 0.12 m and L = 0.2 m, is the engine management system and is 
denoted Surface 1. The vertical rectangle, h = 0.2 m and L = 0.2 m, is the turbocharger casing and 
denoted by Surface 2. The surrounds, which may be approximated as a black body, have a temperature 
of 60C.  
 
a)
Using the graph and also view factor algebra, evaluate the view factors: F1,2, F2,1, F1,3 and  F2,3 
 
b)
By applying a grey-body radiation analysis to Surface 1 with ε1 = 0.5, show that the radiosity  
J1 is: 
 
J1 = 28.35 x 10-9 T1
4 + 0.135 J2 + 254 (W/m2)

c)
A similar analysis is applied to Surface 2 with ε2 = 0.4 obtained the result: 
 
J2 = 22.7 x 10-9 T2
4 + 0.097 J1 + 350 (W/m2). 
 
Use this to estimate the surface temperature of the engine management system when the turbocharger 
housing has a surface temperature of T2 = 700K.

Heat Exchangers
5. Heat Exchangers 
 
Example 5.1 
 
A heat exchanger consists of numerous rectangular channels, each 18 mm wide and 2.25 mm high. In 
an adjacent pair of channels, there are two streams: water k = 0.625 W/m K and air k = 0.0371 W/m 
K, separated by a 18 mm wide and 0.5 mm thick stainless steel plate of k = 16 W/m K. The fouling 
resistances for air and water are 2 x 104 m2 K/W and 5 x 104 m2 K/W, respectively, and the Nusselt 
number given by NuDh = 5.95 where the subscript 'Dh' refers to the hydraulic diameter. 
 
a)
Calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient ignoring both the thermal resistance of the 
separating wall and the two fouling resistances. 
b)
Calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient with these resistances. 
c)
Which is the controlling heat transfer coefficient? 
 
Solution: 
 
Hydraulic Diameter = 4 x Area / Wetted perimetre

Example 5.2 
 
A heat exchanger tube of D = 20 mm diameter conveys 0.0983 kg/s of water (Pr = 4.3, k = 0.632 W/m 
K,  = 1000 kg/m3,  = 0.651 x 103 kg/ms) on the inside which is used to cool a stream of air on the 
outside where the external heat transfer coefficient has a value of ho = 100 W/m2 K. Ignoring the 
thermal resistance of the tube walls, evaluate the overall heat transfer coefficient, U, assuming that the 
internal heat transfer coefficient is given by the Dittus-Boelter relation for fully developed turbulent

ii) The controlling heat transfer coefficient is that for oil,   ho because it is the lower one. Changes in  
ho will cause similar changes in the overall heat transfer coefficient while changes in hi  will cause 
little changes. You can check that by doubling one of them at a time and keep the other fixed and 
check the effect on the overall heat transfer coefficient.

Heat Exchangers
Since the thermal properties are the same and the mass flow rate is the same then the hot stream and 
cold stream heat transfer coefficients are also the same. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note that if the third term in the brackets that includes the resistance through the metal is neglected, it 
will not affect the overall heat transfer coefficient because of the relatively very small thermal 
resistance.
