About the Author
Steve Atwal graduated from the University of Waterloo with an honours degree 
in Computer Science in 1985, and worked as a mainframe software engineer for six 
years in Toronto, for several large well known financial companies like Royal Bank, 
before moving to Vancouver, Canada. He then moved away from the mainframe 
world and entered into the client-server and desktop world, where he worked as a 
consultant for five years for many companies in Vancouver, such as the Vancouver 
Stock Exchange.
Since 1997, Steve has been helping the University of British Columbia to improve 
the Information Technology infrastructure for two large departments. To this end, 
he has been developing IT policies and procedures, capacity planning, chairing and 
participating in various committees for IT initiatives, preparing for disaster recovery 
using virtualization technologies, and ensuring that high security of all servers, 
desktops, and networks is enforced.
Steve chose XOOPS because of its feature set, expandability, and ease of use. You can 
contact him and leave some comments on his blog (www.steveatwal.com).

I wish to thank my daughter Alisha, who has a young and tender 
heart, for her playful distractions that refueled and energized me; 
and our Friday night dinner and movie. I would also like to thank 
my family and friends who have provided endless encouragement, 
especially Navi, Jinder, and Lek. I will not easily forget my recent 
trip to London – thanks Navi! I would also like to thank Michael 
LeBlanc who has been a good friend with his technical advice, code 
input, and reviews.

Without the encouragement, support, and dedication of Douglas 
Paterson and Patricia Weir at Packt Publishing, this book would not 
be a reality. All the staff at Packt has been patient and supportive 
with their ideas and suggestions for the manuscript.

I would like to praise the designers of my new UTStarcom 6700, 
which has been both an entertainment device, with the support of 
live streaming music stations from the UK, as well as a WiFi Skype 
communication device. Yes, I am a computer geek at heart!

And, of course, I would like to thank you, the readers. I hope you 
enjoy this book and send me some feedback on my blog!

Preface
XOOPS is an open-source web content management system, written in PHP. It 
allows site administrators to easily create dynamic websites with great content and 
many outstanding features, with a minimum of coding. It's great for creating small to 
large dynamic community websites, intra-company portals, and much more. It has a 
large, enthusiastic, and helpful community of users.
If you want to create a powerful, fully-featured website in no time, this book is just 
for you. This book will help you explore XOOPS, putting you in the picture of what 
it offers, and how to go about building a site with the system.
You will be introduced to the main components of XOOPS, and learn how to manage 
them. You will develop the skills and the confidence to manage all types of content 
on the site, and also understand how users interact with the site. As you find your 
way round, your own ideas for what you need in your new website will begin to 
crystallize around what you can see about the capabilities and flexibility of XOOPS.
What This Book Covers
The book begins with an overview of XOOPS, its history, and its community.
Chapter 2 shows you how to set up a local development environment for running 
XOOPS, and also what needs to be done before you can install XOOPS to have a live, 
public-facing, website. Once your development environment is set up, the chapter 
shows you how to get XOOPS installed and working.
Chapter 3 takes you through the basic configuration of your XOOPS installation, to 
get all the site details correct, and make sure your site is hooked up to a mail server 
for important notifications.

Preface
[  ]
Chapter 4 covers many of the administration tasks that you will perform while 
managing your site. You will see how to manage users and groups, add and 
activate new modules, add and position blocks, and manage banners and images 
among other things.
Chapter 5 introduces XOOPS themes, which control the look and feel of your site. You 
will see what a theme is, and how to install and modify an existing XOOPS theme to 
customize it to your needs. You will also get started with creating a 
brand-new XOOPS theme.
There are many modules available for extending the functionality of XOOPS. In 
Chapter 6, we cover a number of the most popular modules available from the 
XOOPS website, and explore their installation and use. We will look at modules for 
tasks like handling news, calendars, creating an image gallery and a forum, and also 
adding a sitemap to your site to improve its accessibility to search engines.
Chapter 7 demonstrates the use of the IntranetPack, a free package available from 
www.xoops.org. This package contains some commonly used modules that can be 
used to put together a company portal. The chapter will walk you through each of 
these modules to give you a working intranet.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
There are three styles for code. Code words in text are shown as follows: "The header 
and footer sections can be changed using the main theme.html and style.css files."
A block of code will be set as follows: 
<ul id="nav">
<li class="first"><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/">Home</a></li>
<li><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/mydownloads/">Files</a></li>
<li><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/xoopsfaq/">FAQ</a></li>
<li><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/contact/">Contact Us</a></li>
<li class="last"><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/newbb/">Forums</
         a></li>
</ul>

Overview of XOOPS
Before you can learn to use XOOPS, you need to know what it is, why you should 
use it, and what the future holds for this CMS (content management system).
What is XOOPS?
Before we delve into XOOPS, let's ask a related question: what is a web-based 
content management system (or CMS)? Such a system is available to anyone with 
sufficient permission to access it over the Internet using just a web browser. And, this 
kind of system allows us to manage websites and web content such as text, images, 
sounds, videos, and animations. There is a wide array of content management 
systems, each hoping to fill some special need. The market is fragmented, and there 
seems to be little in the way of standards in the way content is served or managed. 
There are many open-source solutions and almost as many proprietary commercial 
solutions. However, a few of these systems stand out above the rest; XOOPS is one 
such open-source content management system.
So, why do you need a web content management system? One of the biggest 
advantages of using such a system is that it allows collaborative management of 
content. In other words, content can be added and changed by many different 
people, and granular permissions can be assigned to limit who can change and 
manage which content.
This book will show you how to use some common features of the XOOPS content 
management system. XOOPS is a fairly easy-to-use system and we will provide a 
tutorial‑type introduction to it.
In terms of the technology used, XOOPS is a set of programs written in PHP. 
Together, these programs allow you to manage content (such as text, images, audio, 
or video), which is stored on a web server, using a web browser.

Overview of XOOPS
[  ]
A more formal definition of XOOPS, from the Wikipedia 
(http://en.wikipedia.org), is:
"XOOPS is a content management system that allows administrators to easily create 
dynamic websites. It is a tool for developing small to large dynamic community 
websites. It is written in PHP and interfaces with a database such as MySQL."
What this means is that you can share your information with other employees, friends, 
and prospective buyers. The medium for sharing this information is the Internet.
XOOPS is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which gives you 
the right to use it freely, to modify it to suit your needs and then to redistribute it 
under the terms of the GPL. XOOPS is pronounced as "zoo'ps".
The name XOOPS is an acronym of "eXtensible Object-Oriented Portal System". 
The word "portal" hints at the original intent of the software as a portal system, but 
XOOPS is striving to meet the ideals of a true content management system.
The XOOPS Foundation is the umbrella group under which XOOPS is developed 
and maintained, and under which a number of teams are managed. Some of these 
teams are the following:
Core Development Team, responsible for the maintenance and further 
development of the XOOPS core code.
Module Development Team, responsible for the maintenance and further 
development of the XOOPS official modules that come with the full package.
Theme Design Team, responsible for running and supporting Theme Design 
and development for the XOOPS system.
QA (Quality Assurance) Team, responsible for quality-assurance testing 
of modules.
Documentation Team, responsible for the preparation and addition of 
introductory manuals, reference guides, tutorials, and technical documents.
Marketing and Communications Team, responsible for external marketing, 
communications, and visibility of XOOPS.
Support-Forum Moderation Team, responsible for helping the XOOPS 
community and new users solve common problems by ensuring that each 
issue reaches the appropriate team.
XOOPS Core Team, comprising team leaders of all the other teams, which 
is responsible for the "Big Picture", ensuring that the work of all the teams 
comes together to make XOOPS a more cohesive product.

Why XOOPS?
If you take a quick look at the popular "try before you use" website 
www.opensourcecms.com (where you can test-drive a CMS before you install it 
to manage your own website), you will notice that many open-source content 
management systems exist. It is interesting to know what sets XOOPS apart from the 
others. Let us first see what other CMS software is available that is comparable to 
XOOPS. The following table illustrates this:
CMS
License
URL
Drupal
GPL
www.drupal.org
Joomla
GPL
www.joomla.org
Typo3
GPL
www.typo3.org
XOOPS is comparable with these systems, but the combination of ease of use and 
the number of applications or plug-in modules available for it make it a compelling 
choice. In addition, XOOPS provides a complete development API (Application 
Programming Interface) for anyone wanting to extend the functionality of the base 
system. XOOPS has multi-language support, site-wide search, and built-in support 
for banner advertising. There are even some e-commerce modules available if you 
wish to create an online store.
There are some really good reasons to use XOOPS, such as:
Ease of installation. The web-based installation is quick and painless.
Simple web-based administration of users and the website interface.
Multiple output formats, such as RSS feeds, which allow users to check for 
new content on your site without having to open up a web browser.
Workflow is supported by modules that have a submit, review, and 
approve process.
Enterprise-level user authentication is supported using LDAP.
Want to take your corporate data online? Want to start a business online? Want to 
share your family photos with relatives scattered around the world? Want to share 
information on your hobbies? Want to collaborate on projects with other like-minded 
people but they are too far away for you to meet in person?
XOOPS allows you to do all of the above, and much more. If you are willing to learn 
to program using PHP, then what you can do with XOOPS is limited only by your 
imagination. However, you do not need to know PHP in order to manage your web 
content; but a little knowledge of HTML would be handy.

Overview of XOOPS
[  ]
Is XOOPS right for you? There are many CMS and blogging systems that are freely 
available. What you need to consider is the purpose of your website. XOOPS is for 
you if you want:
A portal, a collaboration and feedback website, static and dynamic 
information sharing.
Plug-in features, such as an upload/download area, a calendar, a polling 
area for feedback from users, and an image gallery.
Easy personalization of the website, to allow you to change the look and feel 
of the website without a lot of work.
Presentation of content of different types and technologies.
Subscription to information on your website using technologies such as RSS 
(Really Simply Syndication) that allows users to consolidate their information 
gathering needs in a central location without visiting your website.
Easy web-based methods of adding additional features and performing 
maintenance of older information.
Following are some example websites that use XOOPS. This shows the variety of 
content that can be served by XOOPS.

and the forums at the official website of XOOPS:
http://www.xoops.org.
Some Cautions
XOOPS is a rich content management system that can be used for many types of 
websites, depending on the features you need. It is database-driven, with support 
for both MySQL and PostgreSQL. XOOPS is modular, where new modules that 
provide additional functionality can be added, removed, activated, or deactivated 
easily using the web administration system. Registered users have access to 
change the appearance of some aspects of a XOOPS site, such as the look and feel 
(using themes). Administrators can send email to subscribed users, change the site 
language, and update user permissions.
However, there are some limitations of XOOPS, such as:
Data repository is limited to MySQL and PostgreSQL. If you are using 
anything else, like Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, then you are out of luck.
There is no support for scalability or replication, other than replication 
provided by the database.
XOOPS has no support for data import or data conversion. It is also not fully 
HTML/XHTML-compliant.
There is no version control of documents, or rollback of changes.
There is no WYSIWYG editing for users.
There is no facility to manage a large number of users other than the web 
interface, and that becomes unsuitable for more than a small user base.
Despite these shortcomings, which may be addressed in future releases of the 
XOOPS system, there is plenty to like about XOOPS. Just be aware that if any of the 
above are a must have for you, then XOOPS may not be the right tool for your needs.
Past and Future of XOOPS
XOOPS has evolved from several products. First there was ThatWare, a Slash clone 
written in PHP. Then PHPNuke came along and was written on top of ThatWare. 
PHPNuke was written in PHP and used MySQL for a database.

•

Overview of XOOPS
[ 12 ]
For various reasons, many of the PHPNuke developers decided to create a new 
version of PHPNuke and named it PostNuke; one of the reasons stated was that the 
developers wanted to address the security concerns of PHPNuke. However, some 
criticisms of PostNuke are that the developers change the APIs too frequently and 
that PostNuke is too heavy on computer processing power. PostNuke has in turn 
created a new branch, first called LostNuke and then Xaraya, created by some of the 
key developers of PostNuke.
XOOPS appears to be an object-oriented rewrite of PHPNuke. The XOOPS 
development teams believe that a system that uses objects is more secure and easier 
to develop and maintain.
More detailed information about upcoming XOOPS releases and the roadmap for 
XOOPS is available at http://devteam.xoops.org.
The XOOPS Community
The primary support and online XOOPS community can be found at 
http://www.xoops.org/modules/newbb/.
The XOOPS community is also localized for various countries with online support 
forums. For example, the local support groups for some countries are listed below:
Netherlands: http://xoops.jan304.org/modules/news/
France: http://www.frxoops.org/
Japan: http://xoops.jp/
A complete list of the various local support groups can be found at 
http://www.xoops.org/modules/xoopspartners/.
Summary
XOOPS is a versatile content management system. Although it does have its 
limitations, it can serve you well in many cases. We have pointed out what XOOPS 
is, its shortcomings and benefits, and where to get help if you get stuck. If you decide 
that XOOPS is for you, then read on and we will show you how to start using it.
•

•

Installing XOOPS
Every software program requires installation, and XOOPS is no different. We will 
cover what is required before you can install XOOPS for both a local and hosted 
installation, and then show you how to set up a fully functional website with a 
default XOOPS configuration. To install XOOPS, you need four components:
Apache, the web server that will serve the HTML and PHP web pages
PHP, the programming language that XOOPS requires
MySQL, a SQL database to store the XOOPS data, user IDs, passwords, etc.
XOOPS, a suite of programs/web framework written in PHP that we shall 
use to build and manage our website
Creating the Local Development 
Environment
You may want to play with XOOPS or test new functionality on your own PC before 
installing or updating your live website. To accomplish this, you need to know what 
software is required on your PC to get XOOPS up and running successfully.
If you are running Windows on your PC, like most people, then you should install 
XAMPP Lite, which will ensure that you have the required software before you 
attempt to install XOOPS. XAMPP Lite and the full XAMPP are used by many 
developers who wish to run web-based applications based on the popular PHP 
programming language. In fact, schools use this software when teaching PHP and 
Apache courses.
Before installing XAMPP Lite, make sure that you are logged into Windows with 
the administrator user ID or a user ID that has administrator privileges. If you don't 
know how to set these, look at the Windows Help.
•

•
•

Installing XOOPS
[ 14 ]
If you are using Windows, then you can download XAMPP Lite for Windows from 
http://www.apachefriends.org.
In order to use all the features of XAMPP Lite, make sure that you either disable your 
Windows firewall or enable the following ports inside it; otherwise, the applications 
such as Apache and MySQL will not work:
Port 80 for HTTP
Port 443 for HTTPS (SSL)
Port 3306 for MySQL
Although not required, enable the following ports if you intend to use the full 
version of XAMPP:
Port 21 for FTP
Port 25 for SMTP
Port 110 for POP3
Port 143 for IMAP
Port 8009 for AJP/1.3
Port 8080 for HTTP-ALT (Tomcat default port)
XAMPP Lite, which includes the following software, will install all the components 
you need for XOOPS:
MySQL
PHP
Apache
phpMyAdmin (to manage MySQL)
OpenSSL, SQLite, eAccelerator (you may not need these but they 
are included)
Just extract the XAMPP Lite files, and run the setup_xampp.bat file to configure 
XAMPP Lite for use. Then run apache_start.bat and mysql_start.bat to get 
both Apache and MySQL operational. If you close the command windows that pop 
up, it will shutdown Apache and MySQL. So, just minimize them to keep them out 
of the way. XAMPP Lite makes no permanent changes to your computer and can be 
uninstalled easily by removing the XAMPP Lite folder.

Chapter 2
[ 15 ]
To test to see if everything you need for XOOPS is operational, you need to see if 
Apache, PHP, and MySQL are operational. Just open your favorite web browser 
such as Mozilla Firefox and go to one of the following URLs: http://localhost or 
http://127.0.0.1.
If all is well, you should see the XAMPP for Windows welcome message, which may 
be in German! So click on the link for English under Languages on the left-hand side 
of the page. Click on the Status link on the top left and you will get another page that 
indicates the status of MySQL, PHP, HTTPS, and CGI.
Read the readme_en.txt file that came with XAMPP to get the user ID and 
password for MySQL; at the time of writing, the administrator user ID was root and 
the password was blank: not the type of insecure setup you would have for a live 
website. Use the phpMyAdmin link in the Tools section of the left navigation bar 
at http://localhost to create a new MySQL database for use by XOOPS. You will 
need this for the web-based installation of XOOPS.

To get more detailed information about the installed version of PHP, you can click 
on the phpinfo() link in the left navigation bar. However, just to show that PHP is 
now working fully within Apache on your test computer, let's create a file called 
phpinfo.php with the following PHP code in it and save it into the \xampplite\
htdocs folder on your PC where you extracted the XAMPP Lite files:
<?php
// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
phpinfo();
?>
Then, open your web browser and go to the following URL:
http://localhost/xampp/phpinfo.php
You should see a web page similar to the following, which means that you are ready 
to move on to the next step:

Chapter 2
[ 17 ]
Once you have Apache, PHP, and MySQL operational, all you have to do to start 
installing XOOPS is download the latest stable release of the XOOPS software from 
www.xoops.org, extract the contents of the htdocs folder inside the XOOPS.zip file 
into a folder within \xampplite\htdocs on your PC, such as \xampplite\htdocs\
mysite, and then navigate to http://localhost/mysite to continue the web-
based installation of XOOPS. The web-based installation of XOOPS from this point 
onwards is exactly the same for a local installation as when you are using an outside 
third-party web-host provider.
Creating a Development Environment on 
Linux
If you have Linux installed on your PC, then getting Apache, PHP, and MySQL 
is easy. You may already have these installed, but if not, then use the appropriate 
package manager for your version of Linux to install the missing software. Most 
likely, you will need to use either RPM or DEB packages. My favorite versions of 
Linux are Ubuntu and SUSE; installation of new packages in Ubuntu can be done 
easily in the console window using the following command:
apt-get install <package name>
For example,
apt-get install mysql
The downloading procedure for XOOPS is the same for both Windows and Linux. 
Since the web-based installation of XOOPS from this point onwards is exactly the 
same for a local installation as when you are using an outside third-party web-host 
provider, let us set up the requirements for the hosted live website before we show 
you how to use the web‑based installation of XOOPS.
Preparing the Hosted Server for your Live Site
In order to make your website available to others on the Internet, you will need to 
either make your local installation of XOOPS accessible from outside your home 
network, or like most people, who have a website that must be operational all the 
time, sign up with a web-host provider and then install XOOPS on one of its servers. 
In this section, we will discuss what is required to prepare this outside web-host 
server before you can install XOOPS.

Installing XOOPS
[ 18 ]
When you are ready to set up your live website, you will need to do a few 
things first:
Register a domain name, e.g. www.steveatwal.com. This can be done either 
separately by paying for web-hosting or, as is recommended, by letting 
your web‑hosting company take care of this for ease of future management 
and renewal. In fact, many web‑hosting companies now include the cost of 
registering a domain name when you start a web‑hosting plan. This leaves 
you with practically no reason for paying for it separately.
Find and pay for web-hosting. You can find many web-hosting companies 
listed at web-hosting review sites such as http://www.hostreview.com/. 
Just search for web-host reviews on www.google.com to find many more. 
Note that many web-hosting companies allow you to register your domain 
name or transfer it from another company for free. Web-hosting is very 
cheap starting at less than $7 US per month for 10 GB and more of space and 
lots of bandwidth (amount of data that can be transferred from the web-host 
to people who access your website). Bandwidth (or traffic) becomes very 
important if your website becomes popular or you plan to put a lot of audio 
or video content on your website. In addition, web-hosting companies are 
including the cost of registering a new domain name when you sign up for 
a year or more web-hosting plan. You need to shop around for the best deal. 
Some companies even give you SSH command-line access to their server, in 
case FTP is not sufficient to install a particular application.
Write down the user ID and password you received from your web‑hosting 
company. You will need these to transfer the XOOPS files onto its servers as 
well as creating a MySQL database and user ID for XOOPS.
Usually, when you sign up with a web-host, you get access to a web-based 
control panel such as cPanel that lets you configure Apache, MySQL, and the 
PHP parameters, as well as additional features such as creating sub-domains. For 
example, games.steveatwal.com is a sub-domain of www.steveatwal.com and 
both can have a fully functional XOOPS website independent of each other. This is 
what the control panel of your website would look like:

Chapter 2
[ 19 ]
If you plan to install XOOPS onto a server managed by a web-hosting company, you 
will need a few tools. Listed below are my favorites for each type of tool you need:
Winzip or the free ZipGenius. You can also use the built-in Windows 
Explorer unpacking feature, i.e. right-mouse click on a file and select open 
and then drag and drop files outside of the ZIP archive. However, use 
Winzip or ZipGenius for a full-featured un-archiving program that also 
handles files archived in Linux.
Filezilla for FTP.
Notepad++, a programmer's editor.
Putty, a free Telnet/SSH client. You need this only if you have SSH 
command‑level access to the web-host servers, and plan to install anything 
that cannot be installed using FTP. Usually, you will not need this.
You will need to create a MySQL database and a MySQL user ID that will be used by 
XOOPS to store information into this database.
•

•

Installing XOOPS
[ 20 ]
To create a database, go to the control panel for your web-host account. You need to 
learn how to use this control panel; one web-host may have a different control panel 
than another, but they all basically work in the same fashion and most likely will use 
phpMyAdmin to manage your MySQL database. Following is the MySQL section of 
the cPanel control panel used by BlueHost:
As you can see, it is quite intuitive. So you can easily create the required MySQL 
database and user ID to log into that database. Following are the steps needed to 
create a MySQL database using the cPanel for www.bluehost.com:
1.	 Log into the cPanel.
2.	 Click the icon for MySQL.
3.	 Create a user for your database (keep it short). This is the dbusername, which 
you will be using later.
4.	 Create a database (keep it short).
5.	 An important step is to click the Add User button; otherwise, the user ID will 
not be able to connect to this new MySQL database, and the installation of 
XOOPS will fail.
The format for the MySQL user name will be <yourwebusername>_<dbusername>, 
where <yourwebusername> is the user ID your web-host provider assigned to you 
to log into its website and the control panel shown previously. The <dbusername> is 
the user created for your database above.

Chapter 2
[ 21 ]
The format of the MySQL database name will be <yourwebusername>_<dbname>, 
where <dbname> is the name of your MySQL database. Your host address will be 
localhost. For example, if you use the following names:
dbusername: billyjean
password: password
dbname: DB1
and your login user name for the web-hosting company (<yourwebusername>) is 
jimmydea (which is sometimes the first 8 characters of your domain name), then you 
will use the following information in the web-based installation of XOOPS:
Hostname: localhost
DBUser: jimmydea_billyjean
Password: password
DBName: jimmydea_DB1
Make sure to write this information down in a safe place. You can also use the 
default user ID and password that your web-host provider gave you to create a new 
MySQL database during the web-based installation of XOOPS.
Installing XOOPS
Download the latest stable release of XOOPS to your local computer. We will use 
XOOPS 2.0.15, since that was the latest stable release available for download at the 
time of writing this book.
Uncompress the XOOPS.zip file to a folder on your computer, as shown below:
I like to use Windows Explorer to create a folder called C:\Download into which I 
extract all files downloaded from the Internet.

Installing XOOPS
[ 22 ]
The only folder you need is the htdocs folder; other folders are not needed for a new 
installation of XOOPS, so you can ignore those.
For a local installation of XOOPS, simply copy the contents of the htdocs folder into 
a new folder inside the \xampplite\htdocs folder. This is useful if you decide to 
test multiple installations of XOOPS, each with a separate website. Thus, you may be 
testing the following websites, which are all running a copy of XOOPS independent 
of each other:
\xampplite\htdocs\website1
\xampplite\htdocs\website2
\xampplite\htdocs\website3
For a hosted installation of XOOPS, start up Filezilla, log into the server with your 
web‑host provider, and then copy the contents of the html folder into either the root 
of the public_html folder on the web-host server or a folder within that (if you plan 
to run multiple websites).
Upload the XOOPS files to the root of your website (the public_html folder) to have 
XOOPS launched as soon as someone visits your website.
•

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
After you upload all the files and folders in the html folder to your web server root 
folder, you are ready to start the web-based installation of XOOPS.
Start up your favorite web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, 
and go to your website. For a local installation, simply enter http://localhost 
into your web browser; for a hosted installation, enter the name of your website 
such as http://www.<your website>.com. The rest of the installation process 
will be fairly simple, but may require updating file and folder permissions on your 
web-host server.
Click Next to use the default english language for XOOPS. This will take you to the 
XOOPS welcome screen, which provides some useful information about permissions 
required for a proper setup.

Installing XOOPS
[ 24 ]
Click Next, if you have set the file permissions correctly. If you have not set the file 
permissions, you can do so using Filezilla, as follows:
Log into your website using Filezilla.
Right-click the mouse on the folder uploads, located inside the public_html 
folder, and select File Attributes. Select all the permissions, as follows:
•
•

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
Repeat this for the other folders cache, templates_c.
Set the file permissions for mainfile.php to the equivalent of Linux chmod 
666, i.e. assign read and write permissions for everyone, as follows:
The next screen of the XOOPS installation will verify if the file permissions are 
set correctly.

If all is well, you should see a message indicating No errors detected. You can 
then click Next to enter the MySQL database information required by XOOPS to 
function properly.
The preceding screenshot shows the general configuration settings for a web-hosted 
installation. Note that the table prefix is randomly generated to provide extra security.

Chapter 2
[ 27 ]
For a local installation, the fields will be different. The following is an example of 
the values used by XAMPP, which assigns a blank or empty password for the root 
(administrative user) for MySQL. Normally, for a web-hosted installation of XOOPS, 
you would assign a non-blank value for the MySQL root user.
Database Username: root
Database Password: <blank>
Database Name: jimmydea_DB1
XOOPS Physical Path: C:/Download/xampplite/htdocs/mywebsite
XOOPS Virtual Path (URL): http://localhost/mywebsite
Click Next and you will have the chance to check your settings. Click Next again 
to save the configuration information. You will see the following screen for a 
local installation:
If everything was entered correctly for the database, you should get a message 
indicating Configuration data has been saved successfully to mainfile.php. Click 
Next to go to the next step of the installation.

[ 28 ]
Click Next to confirm the database settings.
Click Next to check if the database exists.

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
For a local installation, you may want the web-based installation wizard to create the 
MySQL database for you, as in the preceding example. Thus, you will see a message 
such as Attempt to create it?. Click Next to allow XOOPS to create the database. For 
a web-hosted installation, this process may fail due to the fact that the database user 
has to be assigned permissions to the database first. It is the best practice to manually 
create the MySQL database first before running the XOOPS installation wizard.
In the preceding screen, XOOPS indicates that the MySQL database was created 
successfully. Click Next to check the database. The following screen indicates that 
XOOPS was able to connect to the MySQL database.
Click Next to create the database tables that XOOPS needs to function appropriately.
If all is well, you will get a message indicating Database tables created. Click Next to 
create the administrator user ID and password that you will use to manage XOOPS 
using the Internet.

Installing XOOPS
[ 30 ]
Enter your name or nickname as a user ID, email address, and password for the 
administrator user ID you want to create. Don't lose this information or you may not 
be able to log into your XOOPS website to manage it or make any changes to it. Click 
Next once you have decided what you want for these values.
XOOPS will populate the database tables with default values and install the module 
required to allow you to administer XOOPS via the web. Click Next to finish 
the installation.
Note that after installation, you can install any number of additional modules you 
may need.
Well done! If you got this far then XOOPS has now been successfully installed. 
All you have to do now is clean up, which ensures that a key file used for proper 
operation of XOOPS is never updated accidentally and removes the installed files. To 
accomplish this:

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
1.	 Use Filezilla to log into your web-host and go to the public_html folder.
2.	 Right-click the mouse on the mainfile.php file and select File Attributes.
3.	 Uncheck all the Write and Execute permissions. This sets the permissions to 
Read Only for everyone, which is equivalent to the Linux command of chmod 
444. This ensures that the file is never updated accidentally, which may cause 
problems for the operation of the XOOPS software.
4.	 In addition, remove the install folder. If you don't, you will get a warning 
to do so when you log into XOOPS to administer it.
To see what your new website looks like with XOOPS installed on it, open your web 
browser and go to either http://localhost or http://www.yourdomain.com. It 
will look something like this:
In the coming chapters, we will show you how to make it look very different and 
provide the functionality you require.
Summary
We have covered a lot of ground in this chapter. We have shown you how to set up 
your local development environment, and shown you what you need to do before 
you install XOOPS on your live, public-facing, website. And finally, we have shown 
you how to set up XOOPS. You should now be ready to delve into the next chapter, 
which shows you how to fine tune and configure XOOPS for your needs before you 
start adding actual web content.


Basic Configuration
Now that you have set up XOOPS, you will want to change the basic configuration 
to suit your needs. For example, you may want to change the title of your website 
(which appears at the top of a web page), your site logo, information that is useful 
for search engines so that others can find your website more easily, email settings to 
ensure that you receive any messages sent from your website, and much more. We 
will go over fine tuning the following settings:
General settings
Extended profiles settings
Meta tags and footer
Word censoring options
Search options
Mail setup
Authentication options
General Settings
Administration of XOOPS is managed using a web browser and logging in as an 
administrator to your website. To do this, enter the administrator login name and 
password you specified in Chapter 2 to install your copy of XOOPS. When you 
log into your website with your administrator user ID, you will not be presented 
with the normal User Menu, but one that has a link to the Administration Menu. 
When you click on the Administration Menu link, you will be presented with the 
Administrator page, as shown in the following screenshot:

[ 34 ]
To get to the General Settings screen, click on the System Admin icon, then 
the Preferences link, and then Edit next to General Settings, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
 
Under General Settings, you will set up your Site Name, Slogan for your site, 
Default language, Default timezone, Default theme, and many other default 
settings. I will only go over the settings you will use most often; other settings are 
fairly intuitive.
Site name is what you will call your website. This will appear in the page 
title of a web browser when someone navigates to your site. The site name 
will also be used when an email is sent from XOOPS to any registered user.
The Slogan will also be displayed in the page title of a web browser, right 
after the Site name. It may also be used by search engines.

Admin mail address is used by XOOPS to send any automatic notifications 
or special administration email messages generated by XOOPS, such as new 
user registrations.
Default language is set to the language you wish to use to display the non-
dynamic content for your website, such as the on-screen hard-coded labels 
and menu descriptions for both the user screens and the administration 
screens. If you have installed the language files for XOOPS or for the module 
being used (see /languages or /module/languages), then you can change 
the default language to one of these other languages.
Module for your start page is initially set to None. If you have installed a 
specific module that you would like to be displayed as the start page, you 
can select it from this drop-down box. All the modules currently available 
to your XOOPS system will be shown in the drop-down box and you can 
simply select the module you wish to use for your start page. For example, 
a common module is the News module. So if you have this installed, then 
you can automatically redirect users who visit your website, such as www.
yourdomain.com, to the News module, i.e. www.yourdomain.com/modules/
news/. Leaving the value as None will display your own custom block. 
Modules provide the functionality of a XOOPS site, and we will look at them 
in more detail in the next few chapters.
Server timezone and Default timezone can be set if you know what 
timezone your web-host is in and your city timezone as offsets from GMT 
(Greenwich Mean Time); otherwise, leave these values alone for now.
The Default theme choice will determine the look and feel of your XOOPS 
website, and this can be easily selected using the drop-down box. Each theme 
will change the look of your site, and the Default theme option determines 
the theme that any visitor to your website will see. The Default theme may 
not be too exciting, so you may want to try some of the others included with 
XOOPS or install a different one. XOOPS themes are located in the /themes 
folder. If you select a different theme, you will not see the change until you 
apply the theme by clicking Go at the bottom of the screen. To see how this 
works, try changing the theme to x2t, which leaves the administration menus 
the same, but gives a more pleasing look.
If you make any changes to your theme template files in /themes/<theme 
name>/templates, then the Check templates for modifications? option 
allows you to ensure that these changes are applied automatically to the 
XOOPS system. This is normally turned off since such changes are not often 
done to a live site.
Registered users are able to select their own theme for visiting the site. 
This theme can be chosen from the Selectable themes option. To enable 
themes that users can use, click on one or more than one (by holding down

[ 36 ]
the Ctrl key). If you want a consistent theme for your website with no end-user 
options to change this look, select the same theme as the Default theme.
Default template set determines the layout of the installed modules. Each 
module has a set of templates that specifies how information is displayed 
when data is input into a module, such as the News module.
Username for anonymous users can be used to set the name displayed when 
unregistered users are allowed to post messages in forums or add comments 
to existing posts. By default, this name is set to Anonymous.
Use gzip compression can be used to try to speed up the display of web 
pages by first compressing the output. However, this may not work on all 
servers, as gzip support has to be installed on the server, so try it and if it 
does not work then turn it off.
Name for user cookies is used to store the username value entered by a user 
when logging into XOOPS. This is used only when Use custom session is 
turned on (next option), and needs cookies to be allowed by the user's web 
browser. The cookie will then be saved for one year in the user PC.
•
•
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 37 ]
Use custom session can be set to Yes to allow XOOPS to remember the 
username entered into XOOPS to log in, by setting the value entered into the 
above cookie name. This allows you to log in more quickly by not having to 
type in this value every time.
Session expiration can be set to the value, in minutes, for which a user can 
be idle before XOOPS automatically logs the user out. This is used only when 
Use custom session is set to Yes.
Session name is the name used to identify each logged in user session. This 
is used only when Use custom session is set to Yes.
Debug mode is used to diagnose problems with XOOPS by showing all 
information and error messages generated by XOOPS. You should turn this 
off before making your website publicly available. If a page does not display 
properly in XOOPS, you can turn on any or all the debug options, such as 
Smarty Templates Debug (for problems with templates).

Activate banner ads can be set to Yes to activate banners that are set up in 
the banners section. To manage banners, click on the System Admin icon 
and then the Banners link.
Turn your site off can be set to Yes to turn your site off, i.e. no one will be 
able to view your website; instead, visitors will see a login box and only the 
administrator or authorized users will be able to login and view the website. 
This feature is useful when performing maintenance on your website, and 
you can enter an HTML message into the Reason for turning off the site 
field that will be displayed to visitors when your site is off.
To avoid your activities on the site influencing the record of the number 
of banner ads' views on your site, you can set the Your IP address field to 
your current IP address. This can be left at the default value, unless you are 
performing extensive banner testing from a particular computer, in which 
case you should enter the IP address of that computer in this field and reset it 
back to the default value afterwards. Note that if you are using a residential 
cable modem or DSL connection, your IP address may be different from what 
you used last time for this field. So always determine and use your current IP 
address. On Windows 2000/XP, you can run the command ipconfig to find 
your IP address.
Use SSL for login can be turned on to enable the username and password to 
be encrypted when transmitted from your computer to XOOPS. However, 
this requires that the firewall be allowed to receive data on port 443 on the 
web-host. So check with your web-host before using this feature. If enabled, it 
will display a secure login link below the username and password login fields 
on your website. This link will then take you to the web page entered into the 
field URL where SSL login page is located in the following screenshot.

Default Comment Display Mode indicates the structure of the way comments 
to posts are displayed. Comments can be activated for particular modules, 
such as the News module. Comments can be displayed as flat, nested, or 
threaded. This setting also affects the way posts are displayed in forums. 
Default Comments Display Order specifies the sort order for comments.
Enable IP bans and Enter IP addresses that should be banned from this 
site are used to prevent "bad" users, such as spammers and hackers, from 
accessing your website.
Module-wide Cache enables XOOPS to retain a snapshot on the server of 
the current data displayed by a module, which speeds retrieval and display. 
When turned on, new data captured by modules will not be shown until the 
cache-time activation expires, or until you reset these values to No Cache. 
This overrides any cache settings for individual modules.

User Info Settings
To access this option, click on the System Admin icon to show the System 
Configuration screen. Then, click on Preferences to show the Site Preferences 
screen, and from there click on Edit next to User Info Settings, which will allow you 
to change settings that can be applied to all users and their login. Following are the 
options available on the settings screen:
Allow New User Registration may be used to allow or disallow new users 
to become registered users of your site with their own login username 
and password. This may be set to No if you feel you have too many 
users and you need to put a cap on this, which may be due to many users 
requesting restricted content that is driving up your traffic and bandwidth 
costs with your web-host.
Select activation type of newly registered users allows you to specify 
how users will be authenticated; either validating automatically by XOOPS 
or sending a validation email to a user by XOOPS before they can login 
(recommended method). If the latter is selected, then XOOPS sends an email 
to the user at the email address they specified when registering; the user 
will then validate their email address by clicking on the link provided in 
the email. This double opt in method (registration, verification of email) 
ensures that you can contact your users at a later time, if needed, with a 
valid email address.

Select Group to Which Activation Mail Will be Sent allows an 
administrator to set which group is to receive an email notification when a 
new user signs up on your website.

On the User Info Settings screen, you can also specify restrictions on the username 
length (maximum and minimum), email addresses that cannot be used by end users, 
minimum user password length, whether users can change their email addresses 
or delete their accounts, special user names that cannot be used (because they are 
reserved for administration), and whether users can upload images (with the size 
specified in these options in pixels and KB) to represent themselves when creating 
new posts, such as those for discussion forums.
Meta Tags and Footer
The Meta Tags and Footer screen can be selected by clicking on the System Admin | 
Preferences | Meta Tags and Footer. Some of the options for this module are briefly 
described as follows:
Meta keywords are the keywords that best describe the content of your 
website. These can then be used by search engines to locate your website 
when search-engine users type in words that they are searching for. Each 
keyword is separated by a comma or a space, e.g. technology, education, free.
Meta description can be used to provide a short description of your website. 
This can also be indexed by search engines for later searching by end users.
Meta Robots tells search engines how to index your site for later searching 
on their websites. Index, Follow allows a search engine to index everything 
that is linked from the main website-index file. No Index, No Follow tells a 
search engine not to index anything on this website.
Meta Rating can be used to indicate any age-level restrictions of content on 
your website, e.g. selecting 14 years will mean that your web content is not 
suitable for anyone under the age of 14.

Meta Author is used to show the author or creator of the site.
Meta Copyright is used to show any copyright restrictions for the site, 
e.g. this helps protect you against someone copying your site content and 
publishing it on their site.
Footer is used to display text at the bottom of every web page. This could be 
used to display a copyright notice.
Word Censoring Options
The Word Censoring Options screen can be selected by clicking on System Admin | 
Preferences | Word Censoring Options. This screen allows the administrator to turn 
on word censoring, which means that if any user enters any particularly objectionable 
words, then those words will be replaced with the value specified as Bad words will 
be replaced with. In the following example, we have enabled censoring of unwanted 
words (by default it is turned off) and if a user types in the words pig or bully into 
any module or forum then they will be replaced with #OOPS#.

Search Options
The Search Options screen can be reached via System Admin | Preferences | 
Search Options. This is a simple screen that allows the administrator to enable or 
disable site-wide search for the website, and specifies the minimum length of words 
that can be used for keyword searches. Since modules do not normally provide their 
own search functionality, they provide handlers to allow XOOPS to return results 
from the global search function; results are also sorted by module.

you wish to use a different mail server then you have the option to specify sendmail, 
SMTP, or SMTPAuth to use your personal or corporate mail server for sending 
messages from XOOPS. You will have to obtain the correct settings from your 
webhost or corporate administrator when you specify a different mail server than the 
default PHP mail() setting.
 
Authentication Options
The Authentication Options screen can be selected using System Admin | 
Preferences | Authentication Options. This screen can be used to integrate XOOPS 
with an Enterprise authentication system. In other words, if you already have a 
username and password database that can be accessed using LDAP, then XOOPS can 
be set to use that database for users trying to log into XOOPS. Only users that exist in 
this LDAP database can then log into XOOPS. In order for this to work, the web-host 
firewall must also allow access out on port 389 to connect to the LDAP server. 

Basic Configuration
[ 46 ]
By default, XOOPS uses its own built-in database to store usernames and passwords 
for users that are registered to use the XOOPS website. So unless you need to tie your 
installation of XOOPS into an existing authentication system, you can leave the data 
on this screen as it is.
We will discuss this further in Chapter 7 when we perform an intranet portal 
case study.
Summary
In this chapter, we have shown you how you can customize the options for your base 
installation of XOOPS. Customizing these options allows you to ensure that your 
website is going to operate in a manner consistent with your needs. Some options, 
such as meta tags and search engine optimization, are covered in greater detail in 
other books. When you have tuned the general settings, search options, meta tags, 
etc., you will have laid the foundation to creating a well-tuned website.

Administration of XOOPS
The basic installation of XOOPS may not be what you are looking for. In this chapter, 
we will show you how to perform the basic administration tasks required to get your 
XOOPS site running the way you want it to. We will delve into the following:
Managing users and groups
Adding and activating site modules
Blocks and content positioning
Miscellaneous tools for managing banners, images, smilies, avatars, 
templates, and comments
Managing Users and Groups
Users who can access and use your website are basically of two types:
Anonymous
Registered
Until visitors identify themselves to your website by logging in, they are classified 
as anonymous. Once visitors are logged in, XOOPS treats them as registered users. 
Registered users can be given more permissions and privileges than anonymous 
users to access content on your website.
Users can also be given ranks to indicate how often they visit your website 
or contribute to posting messages on your website. We will discuss this more 
elaborately in the following sections.

User Registration
By default, anonymous users of our website xoopsbook.steveatwal.com will be 
able to register using the Register now! link on the bottom left of the main page. This 
is controlled by the Allow new user registration? option within System Admin | 
Preferences | User Info Settings. This is the usual method of getting users added 
to your website. With this self‑registration process, an email confirmation is sent to 
the user at the email address they provide during registration. The user then has 
to confirm that this registration was indeed done by them by clicking on the web 
page link included in the confirmation email. The following screenshot is a sample 
confirmation email:
An email is also sent to the administrator of your site notifying them of the new 
user registration.
In addition to this, you can add users manually from the administration area of the 
site, via the option System Admin | Edit Users. For now, we will assume that the 
normal method will be used and allow users to register themselves; not only does this 
reduce the amount of work for the administrator, but it also allows users to assign 
their own Displayname (that allows users to be a little creative) and password.

Chapter 4
[ 49 ]
User Groups
Registered users can be assigned to groups and those groups can be given different 
permissions to your website. Mails can be sent to groups of users to keep them 
informed of changes and special information that you feel they need to be aware of.
In addition to anonymous and registered users, there is another standard group of 
users that is reserved for people who have full administrative rights to access and 
modify your website; this is the Webmasters group.
When you install XOOPS, you also create an initial user who belongs to the 
Webmasters group. You will use this username to access the administration area of 
your website. Keep the password safe for this username and never reveal it to anyone 
unless that person is going to access and manage the administration of your site.
You can either create new users within XOOPS and add them to the Webmasters 
group, or promote self-registered users to the Webmasters group.
One of the uses of groups might be to set up a group of people who are allowed to 
add content to your site using a particular module, such as the News module. This 
new group, which may be called, for example, Publishers, would then be granted 
Module Access Rights (which means that this set of users or group will be allowed 
to see this module and any content displayed by this module when they are logged 
into your site) and Module Admin Rights (which means that this set of users or 
group will be able to manage content using this module) to this News module. Note 
that anonymous users may also be given Module Access Rights for a public site 
where content, such as news, is always shown regardless of whether a user is logged 
in or not.
In summary, after a user has registered on our site, we can add that user to any 
special groups if we decide to allow access to or management of certain modules or 
blocks through the Edit Groups page that can be accessed from System Admin | 
Groups as seen in the following screenshot:

Administration of XOOPS
[ 50 ]
Simply enter the new group name, description (the purpose of the group), and the 
access rights of this group. In the preceding screenshot, only one module is shown 
since additional modules have not been installed yet; this will obviously change as 
you add modules to your site, at which time you can return to this screen and update 
the group permissions.
Note that System Admin Rights will only be assigned to this new group if users 
added to this group will be allowed to make changes to any part of your website. 
Normally, you just need to select the Module Access Rights and the Block Access 
Rights, which means that users will be allowed to view content that is to be 
displayed by modules and blocks.

Chapter 4
[ 51 ]
User Ranks
One method that some site administrators use to encourage users to take a more 
active role in their site is to assign user ranks. This lets other users know how much 
one user participates, for example in posting messages and comments, versus 
another user. Ranks by themselves do not confer any additional privileges to users.
You can create or change user ranks using System Admin | User Ranks. The default 
settings are normally sufficient, unless you have a highly active website where users 
are posting messages frequently and you need to assign detailed ranks based on 
the number of posts a user has made. The following screenshot shows the Image 
(number of stars) next to a user's name based on the number of posts (messages or 
comments) they have made:
Note that the last option in the preceding screenshot indicates if that rank can be 
assigned to users regardless of how many posts they have made. This may be useful 
when assigning ranks to those users who are considered to be administrators or 
content publishers.

Administration of XOOPS
[ 52 ]
Finding Users
If your website becomes very popular, you may have thousands or millions of users. 
You can click on System Admin | Find Users to locate individual or groups of users 
that fit certain search criteria. The following screenshot explains this:
For example, if you need the statistics on how many users signed up on your website 
in the last seven days, navigate to the Find Users page and enter a value of seven 
into the Joined date is less than X days ago field and click Submit.
Mailing Users
Another very useful function is the ability to send a standard email to all users, or 
users that belong to particular groups you have created. For example, if you have 
created a user group called Family Members and wish to send an email only to 

Chapter 4
[ 53 ]
them, then navigate to the System Admin | Mail Users page, select the Family 
Members group, enter a subject, type in your message in the Body field, and click 
Send. Messages can be limited to new registrations (by specifying a date for the 
Registered date is after field).
Note that selecting only the Private Message option will instead send the message to 
a private mailbox created for that user on your new website. The user will then have 
to log into your site to retrieve the message. The following screenshot explains this:
Adding and Activating Site Modules
Modules provide added functionality and extend the usefulness of your website. 
XOOPS ensures that these mini applications, or modules, have a coherent feel. The 
default installation of XOOPS includes only the System module, with the idea 
being that you have a more compact and faster website with only the modules 
that you need.

Administration of XOOPS
[ 54 ]
The System module provides the functionality needed to manage your 
website, such as changing the theme, managing modules, finding and 
managing users, among others.
There is a Private Messaging module called MP Manager that you may wish 
to install. The MP Manager module allows XOOPS to set up a mailbox for 
each registered user on your website, which in turn lets users send private 
messages to each other if they know the Displayname the other person used 
when they registered on your website. Displaynames are shown in other 
modules such as Forums when a user posts messages. The MP Manager 
module can be downloaded from www.exode-fr.com/mpmanager.rar.
Note that the functionality of the System module is available only to a Webmaster, 
after logging in; other modules can expose their functionality to all users or 
particular groups of users depending on whether or not they have been assigned that 
right by the administrator of the site. New modules can be downloaded manually 
from the XOOPS site and then unzipped and copied to the /modules/ folder of 
your site.
New modules copied to the /modules/ folder of your website will appear at the 
bottom of the System Admin | Modules Administration page, ready to be installed 
and activated.

Installing Modules 
In this section, we will install the News module shown in the preceding screenshot 
to our website at xoopsbook.steveatwal.com. To do this:
First download the News module to your computer from the XOOPS site. 
The News module can be found under the Information subject at www.
xoops.org/modules/repository/ and, in particular, at the following URL: 
http://dev.xoops.org/modules/xfmod/project/showfiles.php?group_
id=1008&release_id=60.
On your computer, unzip the module file XOOPS2_mod_news_1.44.zip into a 
new folder called news.
Use Filezilla to copy the entire news folder to the 
/public_html/xoopsbook/modules/ folder.
Navigate to System Admin | Modules to reach the Modules 
Administration page and the News module will appear at the bottom of the 
page as shown in the following screenshot.
Click the Install icon in the Action column next to the News module.

Administration of XOOPS
[ 56 ]
In the preceding screenshot, the icons under the Action column have the 
following purpose:
The icon with the floppy disk is used to install a new module. This will start 
the web-based installation wizard for that module. This icon appears only 
next to the modules that have not yet been installed. These modules appear 
at the bottom of the page at Modules Administration.
The information icon (the one with the i) is used to show any information for 
the module such as name, version, creator, and any other credits given by the 
developer of the module.
For installed modules, the update module icon (the one with the circle 
around it) allows the administrator to recompile and update the database if a 
module isn't functioning properly or requires an update.
For inactive (installed but not activated) modules (for which the Active 
column is not checked), the uninstall module icon (the one with the floppy 
disk and a red dot beneath it) allows the administrator to uninstall a module.
When the Install Module icon is clicked, the web-based installation wizard for the 
module starts. We can assign permissions to users and groups who can use the 
News module after it is installed. To do this, click on System Admin | Groups 
to reach the Edit Groups page. Then, click on Modify next to the type of user for 
which permissions are to be set, i.e. Webmasters, Registered Users, or Anonymous 
Users. The following screenshot shows how we can assign Module Access Rights to 
Anonymous Users so that anyone can view news items posted using this module at 
xoopsbook.steveatwal.com.

Uninstalling Modules
Navigate to the System Admin | Modules page. To uninstall a module, you 
must first deactivate it; the uninstall icon for the module will not appear until you 
deactivate it.
To deactivate a module, remove the checkmark next to the module in the Active 
column and click Submit. This will remove the module from the active list so that no 
visitors to your site will be able to see it, or any content that was displayed by it.
Returning to the System Admin | Modules page will then show the uninstall icon 
next to the module. To remove the module, simply click the uninstall icon. This will 
not remove the actual module files from the web server, but simply put the module 
into an available state (so that it can be installed and activated again if needed) 
and will list the module at the bottom of the Modules Administration page. To 
completely remove the module, remove the corresponding folder for it from the 
/modules/ folder on your web server.

Administration of XOOPS
[ 58 ]
Hiding Modules 
Modules usually appear automatically in menus when they are installed and 
activated. To hide a module, set the Order (0=Hide) column next to the module 
to 0. This will hide any menu listings for the module, but will not deactivate it. 
You can still navigate to the page that contains the module and use it. This may 
be useful when you want to test whether the module works as expected before 
making it available for everyone else to use. On our sample website at xoopsbook.
steveatwal.com, we have installed an additional module called Polls. The following 
screenshots show the effects before and after we hide the Polls module; note that the 
Polls module is still functional but it no longer appears in the left-hand side menu 
after we hide it.

Chapter 4
[ 59 ]
After we hide the Polls module (by setting Order = 0):
Setting the Default Module
We will set the News module to appear as the default module to be shown on the 
main page of our website xoopsbook.steveatwal.com. To do this, we navigate 
to System Admin | Preferences | General Settings and change Module for your 
start page from None to News and click Go!. Now, when anyone navigates to 
http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com they will automatically be redirected to the 
News module at http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com/modules/news/. The main 
page of the website will now look as follows:

Administration of XOOPS
[ 60 ]
You can download many modules to install on your website from 
www.xoops.org/modules/repository/ such as:
NewBB, a forum module for online discussions
MultiMenu, to create custom menus
TinyContent, for creating subject-based content
We can also download from www.smartfactory.ca, modules such as:
SmartSection, an article-management module similar to News with sections
SmartPartner, an advanced partners-management system
SmartFAQ, a questions-and-answers management system
WF_Downloads, which lets you create a downloads section on your site so 
that visitors can download files
Blocks and Content Positioning
Content and navigation menus can be positioned using Blocks. Blocks provide 
a way to group content generated by modules. You can also create new custom 
blocks. Navigate to System Admin | Blocks to see the current active blocks on your 
website, as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 61 ]
The Side column has several options that allow you to either hide the block or 
position it on the web page. Each XOOPS theme divides website content into 
columns; left, center, or right. Some themes have only two columns, in which case 
the blocks that are positioned in the center column are not shown. Values for the 
Side column are:
Side Block — Left (places the block in the left column of the page)
Center Block — Left (places the block on the left side of the center column of 
the page)
Center Block — Center (places the block in the center of the center column of 
the page)
•
•
•

Administration of XOOPS
[ 62 ]
Center Block — Right (places the block on the right side of the center 
column of the page)
Side Block — Right (places the block in the right column of the page)
The Visible column values show or hide the indicated block. Values for the Weight 
column determine in which order the blocks are displayed on your site. Blocks are 
displayed in increasing Weight order from top to bottom. The Show blocks visible 
in option lists the blocks that can be shown in the indicated module or at the 
top-level page of the site, e.g. the User Menu block is shown on all pages you see 
when you navigate to the site.
Installed modules usually come with their own blocks to allow for easy positioning 
of content and functionality provided by the module. Blocks allow the module to 
display content captured or generated by the module, whereas the module itself 
provides some sort of functionality such as displaying the current monthly calendar. 
For example, we can add the Random News block for the News module as follows:
Select Top Page from the drop-down menu next to Show blocks visible in.
Position the block on the page by selecting appropriately where to position 
the block using the Side column. We will position it on the right side of 
the page.
Set the Visible column to Yes, to show the block.
Blocks can also be used to run PHP scripts, or show static HTML, banners, and 
images. A Webmaster can create a new customized block in XOOPS using the Add A 
New Block page, by navigating to System Admin | Blocks, as shown next:
•
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 63 ]
After adding a block, or module that has blocks, you also have to set permissions 
to allow anonymous (all) visitors to your website to see and use the blocks. Block 
permissions are set using System Admin | Groups by setting the Block Access 
Rights for Anonymous Users.

Administration of XOOPS
[ 64 ]
Miscellaneous Tools: Banners, Images, 
Smilies, Avatars, Templates, Comments
XOOPS allows you to add content that could be reused multiple times in various 
locations on your website. This content is listed under System Admin.
System Admin | Banners will show the page in the following screenshot. This 
allows you to create clients and advertisement banners for those clients, which can 
then be displayed on your site (usually at the top of each page of your site). One 
example is client Google with advertisement banners from its AdSense program. 
These banners may be images or flash movies, which when clicked will take you to 
the website advertised in the banner.

Chapter 4
[ 65 ]
Each time one of your banners is shown to a visitor, the impressions made by this 
banner are increased by one by XOOPS and will be displayed under the Impressions 
column above. If a client is paying you to show the banner a set number of times, 
then the Imp. Left column will show how many times a banner still has to be shown 
before you have fulfilled your commitment after which you may turn the banner 
off unless the client pays you again to show the advertisement. Some clients pay 
you based on how many of your visitors click on their advertisement rather than 
how many times you show their advertisement, in which case the Imp. Left column 
will be set to the default of Unlimited, and instead you will be paid based on the 
actual number of clicks. Note that unless the client does not have its own automated 
system that keeps track of the number of click-throughs it receives (i.e. the number of 
times a visitor clicks on the advertisement on your site and is passed on to the client 
website), the information shown on this screen is for your use only and does not 
need to be sent to the client (unless there is a dispute and you feel that you are not 
being adequately compensated for the agreed upon click-through rate).

Administration of XOOPS
[ 66 ]
As an example, let's create a new client of Google, so that we can use its AdSense ads 
on our site, and then create a new banner for this client. The following screenshot 
shows the sample data for this. The client login and client password will be used by 
the client to check the status of its banner ad and other statistics when it logs in to the 
Advertising Statistics page on our site, such as http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.
com/banners.php, after its client account and banners have been created. This 
also lets the client update the URL to which its banner ad is directed, just in case it 
changes the focus of its advertisement.
You must create a new client first before you use the Banners page to add a new 
banner. We will use this new section, as filled out in the following screenshot, to 
create a new banner advertisement for this client. Note that if more than one client is 
created, then you have to make sure you select the right client from the Client Name 
drop-down field when creating a new banner.

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
Note that clients may have their own custom HTML code that you need to use, in 
which case you would ignore the Image URL and Click URL fields and instead 
check on the Use HTML? field and enter the custom HTML code into the Code 
HTML field.
Managing Images
System Admin | Image Manager will show the following page, which allows you 
to create a category of images and then add images into that category. This category 
and the set of images can then be used by modules that require images. An example 
is the extcal calendar module, which displays images above a monthly calendar.
Images that are uploaded and organized by the Image Manager can be retrieved for 
use throughout your site. When creating a new image category, you must specify the 
Category Name under which the images will be stored and retrieved on your site, 
who has the permission to manage this category (for example, to use images in this 
category), who has the permission to upload images into this category, the maximum 
image dimensions, and maximum file size for images.
Note that the Add Image File section is shown on the Image Manager screen only 
after a category is created to house images. Let me explain some of the fields shown 
on the Add Image File section, so you know how to use them:

Administration of XOOPS
[ 68 ]
Under the Add Image File section, Display order in image manager is 
used to set the order in which categories appear in the Image Manager 
drop-down box.
Display this image is set to Yes by default. Setting Display this Image to No 
will hide the image from people when they access this category from the 
user side.
The following screenshot shows the Add Image File section on the Image Manager 
page:
Managing Smilies
Smilies are little images that people can use to express themselves. Smilies can be 
inserted anywhere in the text of an article, comment, or post from both the user 
and admin sides of the XOOPS system. System Admin | Smilies will show the 
page shown overleaf, which allows you to add special shortcut codes for images. 
These shortcuts can then be used in message posts and forums, where they will 
be replaced with the corresponding images when your post is displayed on the 
website. For example, the code :-) will display an icon, or smilie, that shows a face 
with a smile. You can create new smilies by entering a unique code and uploading 
a corresponding smilie or image. The Display in Form? option will allow the 
administrator to either show or hide this image/smilie in submission forms (where 
the user enters some data and submits it to your site).

Chapter 4
[ 69 ]
Managing User Avatars
Avatars add a bit of 'visual identification' to users and are often used next to a 
username, when they post messages or comments on your website. System Admin 
| Avatars will show the following page, which allows you to add avatars. System 
Avatars are images uploaded by the site administrator in the Avatar Manager 
section. Custom Avatars are images uploaded by a user to create avatars that they 
prefer. For a user to be able to upload an avatar, the user must be granted permission 
to do so.

Administration of XOOPS
[ 70 ]
The Display order in image manager field is used by the image manager to sort 
avatars. If Display this image? is set to No, the avatar will not be displayed to the 
user in the list of avatars the user can choose from.
Managing Templates and Themes
System Admin | Templates will show the following page, which allows you to add 
new templates to your website. Templates allow you to change the way content is 
displayed within the themes used on your website. This will be covered in more detail 
in Chapter 6. Suffice it to say that the Template Set Manager allows you to add, delete, 
edit, and duplicate the HTML templates that control block and module layout.

Chapter 4
[ 71 ]
Managing Comments
System Admin | Comments will show the following page, which allows you to 
show, edit, and delete comments posted by users of your website. This allows you to 
remove or edit offensive comments to avoid inappropriate words, although policies 
should be set up and displayed for users to follow when posting comments on 
your website to avoid offending anyone. Each module using the XOOPS comments 
system has a configuration option (accessed via the Modules Settings page) where 
you can specify whether or not comments are automatically approved, need to 
have moderator approval before being shown to any other users, or are disabled 
altogether. The Comment Manager allows the site administrator to edit and delete 
any comment that has been generated by any module that supports the comments 
feature. Some filter options are available, as shown in the three combo-box menus as 
follows, that allow the site administrator to show only those comments that need to 
be managed. For example:
The Module dropdown can be used to select a particular module, and then 
display comments that were posted only in that module.
The Status dropdown can be used to display comments that have a particular 
status. The status can be any of the following:
Pending: New comments posted are in the pending state 
until they are activated by the site administrator, so that 
they can be displayed on the site. Automatic activation of 
comments can be set in the preferences for each module that 
supports comments.
Active: This means that these comments have been approved 
by the site administrator, and are displayed on the website.
Hidden: This means that these comments are not shown on 
the site because the site administrator has set their status to 
hidden. As with the pending option, hidden comments are 
not shown on the website.

Summary
In this chapter, we have covered many administration tasks that you will perform 
when you manage your site. We have gone over how to manage users and groups, 
adding and activating new modules, adding and positioning blocks, and various 
other tasks that involve managing banners, images, etc. Please experiment with 
these administration tasks until you understand how to use them, and under which 
circumstances they make sense.

Creating Your Own Themes
Many themes are available from various sources for XOOPS. To pick one, you just 
need to decide the type of website you wish to have, e.g. either related to fitness, 
music, or sports.
We will look at what a theme is, how to install one, and then take a two-pronged 
approach to creating our own themes:
Modify an existing theme to create a customized version suitable for 
your website
Create a brand new theme
As before, we will install themes and show how they work on our demo website at 
xoopsbook.steveatwal.com.
What is a Theme?
A theme defines the general look and feel of a XOOPS site. The theme, or skin, 
allows the separation of code that runs in the background of the site from the way 
information is presented to the user. The benefit of this is that an administrator 
(or user with sufficient privileges) can easily change the look of a site by simply 
selecting a new theme and then applying it.
From a developer's perspective, a XOOPS theme consists of a set of files in a theme 
folder where XOOPS is installed. The following screenshot shows the basic structure 
of this folder:
•
•

Creating Your Own Themes
[ 74 ]
As you can see, the folder has an images folder that contains the images used by the 
theme, plus a few key files such as style.css (that will control the layout and format 
of the various elements of the theme, e.g. fonts), theme.html (that controls the overall 
layout and structure of the theme, e.g. whether to use a header, footer, left block, 
right block, center block, or all), as well as files for the various blocks of the theme 
that will be used.
The following diagram shows graphically the parts of the page that are changed by 
these files:
The header and footer sections can be changed using the main theme.html and 
style.css files.

Chapter 5
[ 75 ]
Note that in XOOPS, templates are not the same as themes. Themes define the 
structure and layout of the entire site, and common elements in all pages, such as page 
colors, banners, width of left column, and if a header or footer bar exists. Templates 
control the design and layout of page elements, such as blocks (e.g. Main Menu, User 
Menu, and Recent Topics), custom blocks, and module content (e.g. index page of 
News). In addition, themes are changed using an HTML editor and FTP client, such as 
Filezilla. Templates are changed inside the XOOPS admin control panel.
A visit to the XOOPS website shows that a few themes are more popular than the 
rest. For example, the top themes as of this writing are 4whitebusiness (mostly 
designed for business), 7dana-clean, alightFC, 4thefort, imago06, 7dana-Xred, aqua-
um, 4colorbiz, blue_lagoon, and EADJ2.1.
You can try any of these by simply downloading them, uncompressing the files, and 
copying them into your themes folder on your website, as shown in the previous 
chapters. Selecting a theme that is suitable for your particular website is a matter 
of both personal taste and functionality, e.g. do you wish to display information 
on your website in two columns, or do you have so much information that a three-
column theme is necessary? Do you like a particular color scheme, or do certain fonts 
seem more suitable for your website?
As you can see, at some point in time, you will have the urge to change the look and 
feel of your website. Since XOOPS uses themes, you can accomplish this by finding 
a suitable theme online, either free or from a commercial vendor specializing in 
creating themes.
Following are the screenshots of some of the themes mentioned here to give you 
an idea of the variety that is available for free download and use. You will have to 
determine if any of them meet your particular requirements.

Installing a New Theme
XOOPS comes with several themes that allow you to change the look and feel of your 
new website with a few mouse-clicks. We will again use our demo website xoopsbook.
steveatwal.com to demonstrate how to change the theme and show the changes.
To change the theme, we will download the Blue Shine theme from the website at 
http://www.xoopsdesign.com/modules/PDdownloads/viewcat.php?op=&cid=1.
Please note that you cannot download this theme until you first register at this 
website by creating a user ID and password, responding to the email you receive after 
registration, and then logging into the website with your new user ID and password.
At this point, we will assume that you know how to unzip a file using zipGenius 
(or WinZip) and use Filezilla to upload the uncompressed files to your website. So, 
unzip the Blue Shine theme and upload the entire blue_shine folder (located inside 
the xoops_theme_blue_shine\XOOPS theme folder when you unzip the Blue Shine 
theme file) to the location /public_html/xoopsbook/themes/ on your website. 
This is assuming, of course, that XOOPS for our website http://xoopsbook.
steveatwal.com is installed in /public_html/xoopsbook/.
Note that you can also upload the template files using the XOOPS administration menu 
at System Admin | Templates as long as the file is of the format tar.gz or .tar.
Once the folder has been uploaded, select and activate the new theme from the 
XOOPS web-based administration interface as follows:
Navigate to System Admin | Preferences | General Settings.
Change Default Theme to blue_shine.
Optionally, also change Selectable Themes so that only blue_shine is 
selected. This prevents users from changing the theme to something else and 
is needed if you wish to allow only one common theme for your website.

Now, you should see something like the following:
At this point, you will notice that you need to change the following parts of the 
theme to tune it to your needs:
Menus across the top of the website, e.g. you may not need the Downloads 
menu or the Articles menu, if you do not wish to use the article or the 
WF-Downloads modules
Website logo across the top of the website, which may in fact, be composed 
of several smaller images.
Fonts and colors used, e.g. you may like the layout but might feel that a 
different font is to your liking.
To remove menus, edit the theme.html file located at /public_html/xoopsbook/
themes/blue_shine/theme.html, and scroll down until you see the following code. 
We will remove the highlighted lines below, which will leave only the Home, News, 
and Forum menus:
<td id="headmenu"><a class="menuHead" 
href="<{$xoops_url}>/index.php">Home</a></td>
<td class="separator"></td>
<td id="headmenu" ><a class="menuHead" 
href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/news/">News</a></td>

<td class="separator"></td>
<td id="headmenu"><a class="menuHead"

Note that in the preceding code, there is one extra / after the <{$xoops_imageurl}>. 
However, this is how the developer coded this theme and we can remove that extra / 
ourselves if we want to ensure that the code is totally correct, but the image will still 
be displayed with the extra / there.
We will also remove the large XOOPS banner at the bottom of the page by navigating 
to System Admin | Banners and removing the Advertising Client named XOOPS. 
Now, you should see something like the following:

As a hint, you can edit files on your website using Filezilla by setting the options 
within it to open a file on the website host using your favorite text editor. To do this 
for Notepad, open Filezilla and select Edit | Settings | Interface Settings | File 
Viewing/Editing and set Default program to view or edit a file as C:\WINDOWS\
NOTEPAD.EXE; then, when you connect to your website using Filezilla, simply 
right-click on the file /public_html/xoopsbook/themes/blue_shine/theme.html 
and select View/Edit, which will then automatically download a copy of theme.html 
and open it within Notepad.
When you are done editing the file, save it within Notepad (or, if you specified 
another editor, save the file within that program), close Notepad, and switch back to 
Filezilla, which will prompt you to upload the saved file back to the server; just select 
Yes to do so. The following screenshot shows the prompt we receive within Filezilla 
after removing the preceding lines of code from theme.html, saving the file within 
Notepad, and then closing Notepad.
Note that the changes you have made to theme.html and style.css may not 
be reflected on your site. This may be because in System Admin | Preferences | 
General Settings the value for Check templates for modifications ? may be No. I 
would recommend you keep this value set to Yes, until you have finished editing 
your theme, at which point set it back to No since it will improve performance. 
Changes to themes are reflected on your site only when the template file is updated.
Changing the logo is a matter of finding the logo image file used by the theme and 
uploading your own image file to replace it. Changing fonts and colors will be 
covered in the next section. The default logo image for this theme is located at /
public_html/xoopsbook/themes/blue_shine/images/logo.gif and looks 
as follows:
All you need to do to change the logo is create an image of the same height and 
width, give it the same name and upload the file back to the same location on the 
website. Note that you need to save this file in the same file format, i.e. .gif in this 
case, as the original. You can use your favorite image-editing software for this; even 
the Paint program that comes with Microsoft Windows XP will suffice; however, you 
can also use Gimp (both on Windows and Linux).

Customizing an Existing Theme
We will take the most popular theme, as indicated on the XOOPS website, namely 
4whitebusiness, and show you how to customize it.
Navigate to the www.xoops.org website, and under Community select the Theme 
Library. Then click on Popular to see the list of most popular themes. Download the 
4whitebusiness theme and extract the file using zipGenius (or WinZip). Then, we will:
Upload the 4whitebusiness folder to our 
/public_html/xoopsbook/themes/ folder.
Log into XOOPS on our website and then set the theme 4whitebusiness as 
the default to be used by visitors to the website.
We will now customize this theme to show you how to change common elements 
such as:
Site logo
Font
Colors
Layout
Following is a screenshot of the 4whitebusiness theme as it appears on our demo 
website http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com before any modifications:

Changing the Site Logo
Before you can create a new site logo, you must ensure that the logo has the same 
size, i.e. width and height. The best way to do this is open the existing site logo, 
located at /public_html/xoopsbook/themes/4whitebusiness/logo.jpg, in your 
favorite image viewer or image editor and check the size.
To accomplish this in the freeware software program IrfanView (downloadable 
from most freeware websites such as www.softpedia.com), select Image | Resize/
Resample, which will show you the existing size of the image in pixels, and allow 
you to modify the size of the image to the same dimensions as the original logo.jpg. 
You may have to tweak it a little by adding filler space. If you don't resize the image, 
the image may appear too large or too small to fit into the theme header, and the rest 
of the theme elements will also not be aligned properly.
The logo for the 4whitebusiness theme has the following dimensions:
Width: 400 pixels
Height: 100 pixels
•
•

Creating Your Own Themes
[ 84 ]
The following screenshot shows the original logo image:
Then, use your favorite image editor to create another image of the exact size, shown 
as follows:
Now, using Filezilla:
1.	 Navigate to the 4whitebusiness theme directory, i.e. 
/public_html/xoopsbook/themes/4whitebusiness.
2.	 Upload the new logo.jpg image into the /public_html/xoopsbook/
themes/4whitebusiness folder and overwrite the existing one (or rename 
the existing file first if you would like to revert back to it later). And that 
is all!
Changing the Font
After a while, you may start to get tired of the Verdana and Arial fonts combination 
you see everywhere. Modifying the fonts used by a theme is as easy as making a few 
changes to the theme stylesheet.
Typically, the main stylesheet will be called style.css. In this particular case, 
paragraph content uses Verdana while headers use Arial. Instead, we want to use 
Helvetica for content and Times New Roman for the headers. So, to accomplish this:
1.	 Open style.css.
2.	 Scroll down to the fourth line that starts with:

Chapter 5
[ 85 ]
       table td {padding: 0; border-width: 0; font-family: Verdana,
           Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}
3.	 Change this line so that the fonts listed after font-family are:
       font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;
4.	 Scroll down to the line that starts with:
       th {color: #000000; padding : 2px; vertical-align : middle;
       font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}
5.	 Change the fonts listed after font-family to:
       font-family: "Times New Roman",serif;
Now, because the content has been changed to Arial, it looks slightly too small. We 
will increase the font size to make it more legible. So, we scroll down to the following 
selectors and change the font-size property to 1.2em:
table td line:
       table td {padding: 0; border-width: 0; font-family: Helvetica,
       Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;}
th line:
       th {color: #000000; padding : 2px; vertical-align : middle;
       font-family: "Times New Roman",serif;}
td#centerCcolumn div.blockContent line:
       td#centerCcolumn div.blockContent { padding: 3px;
       margin-right: 0px;margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 2px;
       font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 90%; text-align: left;}
td#centerLcolumn div.blockContent line:
       td#centerLcolumn div.blockContent {padding: 3px; margin-left: 
        3px; margin-right: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; font-size: 1.2em;
        line-height: 120%;}
td#centerRcolumn div.blockContent line:
       td#centerRcolumn div.blockContent {padding: 3px;
       margin-left: 2px;
       margin-right: 3px;
       margin-bottom: 2px;
       font-size: 1.2em;
       line-height: 120%;}

Then, we remove the font-size: x-small property from these columns, so that it 
doesn't conflict with the new font size that was defined (1.2em):
td#rightcolumn div.Blockcontent
td#leftcolumn div.blockContent
td#mainmenu a.<various elements>
Changing the Colors
You have now changed the site logo and altered the fonts to better fit the ideal look 
of your website. However, the colors still do not look quite right. Fortunately, the 
theme stylesheet will allow you to change the colors of your website also.
Let's say that you want to change the color of the left column to accent the header:
Find the td#leftcolumn selector.
Add the following property, which changes the color to blue-gray: 
background-color: #A2B2C1;
And then, to push people to read the center column, we'll subdue the right column 
by changing the color of the column partition to light-gray:
Find the td#rightcolumn selector.
Add the following property: background-color: #eeeeee;
Changing the Layout
As a result of modifying the font size, the box in the center-right column is making 
contact with the left column. It looks like the two columns are running into each 
other. We need more whitespace. To do this, we'll need to make some changes to one 
of the theme-layout files.
Open theme_blockcenter_l.html.
In the first <table> tag, add a style attribute to provide a wider margin:
       style="margin-left: 4px;"
Thus, the second line in the file looks like:
       <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"
              style="margin-left: 4px;">
This will add some whitespace, making the template appear less cramped and 
more polished.

Chapter 5
[ 87 ]
Following is a list of all the layout files that you can modify, which correspond to the 
various sections of a page as shown in the graphical diagram earlier in this chapter:
theme_blockleft.html
theme_blockcenter_l.html
theme_blockcenter_c.html
theme_blockcenter_r.html
theme_blockright.html
Each of these template files is responsible for generating a part of the page. 
theme_blockleft.html and theme_blockright.html generate the left and right 
columns, while the center block templates (theme_blockcenter_l.html, theme_
blockcenter_c.html, and theme_blockcenter_r.html) generate the left, center, 
and right portions of the center column. As a result, XOOPS actually uses a 
five-column layout.
We have covered the basics of customizing a XOOPS theme. The XOOPS themes are 
designed to be easy to modify. We discussed changing the site logo, the fonts, the 
colors, and even the spacing. Delving deeper into this will allow you to drastically 
change XOOPS themes and make them closer to your ideal vision of your website.
Creating a New Theme
We will now take you through creating a brand new theme. This is not as hard as it 
seems, and may be necessary to create a truly unique look for your website. We will 
show you how to create the major parts of a theme.
However, we will put a twist to things; rather than just walk you through creating 
a new theme, step by step, we will convert the Mollio theme from www.mollio.org 
into a XOOPS theme. The reasons for this are:
It will give you the foundation to convert themes from other content 
management systems to XOOPS, and thus contribute to the XOOPS 
community if you decide to share these creations.
It will let you build new themes more easily, without having to reinvent 
the wheel.
In the previous section, we showed you how to modify an existing XOOPS theme. 
Now, we will convert a non-XOOPS theme into a XOOPS theme.
To get started, you will need to download the Mollio theme package file from 
http://www.mollio.org, or from our demo website at http://xoopsbook.
steveatwal.com/mollio_version1.1.zip.

Extract the theme package into a folder called Mollio, and decide which version of 
the template files to use. We have decided to use the Type C theme style, which has 
the following features:
Type C: 3 columns Main, Left-hand navigation, and Right Sidebar
The following screenshot shows what this theme looks like:
Open the typec.html template file and remove all the content (it simply 
demonstrates the styles for each CSS class and ID). You will be left with basic page 
containers for:
Header
Site Name
Search
Horizontal Navigation
Content Wrap
Utility (left side bar)

Content (center column)
Sidebar (right side bar)
Footer (for content area)
Poweredby (Mollio logo that appears in the top-right of the page)
To see the above visually, take a look at the following figure:
Next, create a new folder called MX for your Mollio XOOPS theme. Then:
Copy typec.html into MX and rename it to theme.html.
Copy all stylesheets from the subfolder /css into MX.
Rename main.css to style.css.
Copy the following folders to the MX folder:
Images
Js
Wsimages
Copy all images from the /css/images subfolder in the Mollio folder to the MX/
images folder.
Header
Open the file theme.html, and place the following tags in the HEAD section:
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; 
                                      charset=<{$xoops_charset}>" />

media="screen" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="<{$xoops_url}>/themes/MX/
                                          print.css" media="print" />

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
                    href="<{$xoops_url}>/themes/MX/ie6_or_less.css" />
<![endif]-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="<{$xoops_url}>/themes/MX/js/
common.js"></script>
Display the site name in the template site-name div:
<div id="site-name"><{$xoops_sitename}></div>
In the search div, change the form action to point to the XOOPS search script:
<form action="<{$xoops_url}>/search.php">
Populate the horizontal nav strip with links to XOOPS modules:
<ul id="nav">
<li class="first"><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/">Home</a></li>
<li><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/mydownloads/">Files</a></li>
<li><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/xoopsfaq/">FAQ</a></li>
<li><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/contact/">Contact Us</a></li>
<li class="last"><a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/newbb/">Forums</a></li>
</ul>
In the content-wrap container, look at the utility div. Delete all of the content within 
the utility div and add the following to display left-side XOOPS content:
<{foreach item=block from=$xoops_lblocks}>
<h4><{$block.title}></h4>
<{$block.content}>
<{/foreach}>

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
The preceding code tells XOOPS to populate the HTML container with all the 
modules assigned to the left column of the page (therefore, it would make sense for 
this code to be in the left column of the HTML template). There is a corresponding 
block of code for each column in the template.
As of version 2.0, XOOPS has been using the Smarty template engine, which means 
that themes will have Smarty tags embedded in the HTML code, as in the previous 
code. Smarty tags are delimited by <{ and }>. Thus, in the preceding code, following 
are the Smarty tags:
<{$block.title}>
<{$block.content}>
One benefit of making use of Smarty tags is that they speed up site loading because 
content of these tags have already been processed and compiled. Thus, there is no 
need to create your own custom code to get the site URL, the theme folder, etc. 
Instead use a Smarty tag. To find out more about the Smarty template engine, visit 
the Smarty website at http://smarty.php.net, or refer to the book Smarty PHP 
Template Programming and Applications from Packt Publishing (ISBN 1-904811-40-X).
Content
In the content container, delete all the existing content (with the exception of the 
footer container), and add the following code to display XOOPS modules assigned to 
the center-center column. Note that in this modification of the Mollio template, only 
center-center content is displayed (no code has been included to show center-right or 
center-left content):
<{foreach item=block from=$xoops_ccblocks}>
<h2><{$block.title}></h2>
<{$block.content}>
<{/foreach}>
In the footer container, add the following line:
<p><{$xoops_meta_copyright}> By <{$xoops_sitename}><br />All 
trademarks used are properties of their respective owners. All rights 
reserved.</p>
Content on the right side of the page appears within the featurebox class; mostly, 
because I think it looks pretty good, and differentiates it from the other content on the 
page. The XOOPS right-column content appears within this container, which is called 
sidebar in the Mollio template. The right-side content is displayed with this code:
<{foreach item=block from=$xoops_rblocks}>
<div class="featurebox">
•
•

[ 92 ]
<h3><{$block.title}></h3>
<{$block.content}>
</div>
<{/foreach}>
The last step requires us to make some additions to the style.css stylesheet. 
These additions will allow the left-side vertical menu to work as it does in the static 
HTML-based Mollio template:
#usermenu a:link, a.menuMain:link, a.menuTop:link, #usermenu a:
visited, a.menuMain:visited, a.menuTop:visited, #usermenu a:hover, 
a.menuMain:hover, a.menuTop:hover, #usermenu a:active, a.menuMain:
active, a.menuTop:active {
display: block;
width: auto;
padding: 0 0 0 25px;
background: #fff url("images/sprites.gif") no-repeat 10px -695px;
text-decoration: none;
font-weight: bold;
font-size: 0.9em;
line-height: 1.9;
color: #000;
border-top: 1px solid #fff;
border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;}

a.menuMain:hover, a.menuTop:hover {
color:#c00;
background: #fee url("images/sprites.gif") no-repeat 10px -695px;
text-decoration: none;}

a.menuSub:link, a.menuSub:visited, a.menuSub:hover, a.menuSub:active {
display: block;
width: auto;
margin: 0 0 0 23px;
padding: 0 0 0 23px;
background: #fff url("images/sprites.gif") no-repeat 0 -798px;
text-decoration: none;
font-weight: normal;
font-size: 0.8em;

color: #000;}
a.menuSub:hover {
color:#c00;
background: #fff url("images/sprites.gif") no-repeat 0 -798px;
text-decoration: none;}
So, we have just gone through converting a theme from Mollio to XOOPS. We have 
changed three key areas of the theme: header, content (including footer), and the 
"Powered by…" logo. We have shown the site name, search, and navigation menu at 

Chapter 5
[ 93 ]
the top of the page, as well as added left-column, right-column, and center-content 
areas. Following are some screenshots of the new theme in action:
After a user logs in, the login section on the left column will disappear as shown in 
the following screenshot:

Summary
In this chapter, we have shown you what a theme is, how to install one, how 
to modify an existing XOOPS theme to customize it to your needs, and how to 
create a brand-new XOOPS theme. There is a lot more that you can only know by 
experimenting, such as the Smarty template engine and the various tags available for 
you to use, but you should have the foundation and confidence to start creating your 
own themes. Unless, of course, you would rather have someone else design themes 
for you, in which case there are many commercial sources you can turn to.
In case you want to try the new theme we created in this chapter, you can download 
it from http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com/MX.zip.

Popular Modules
There are many modules available for extending the functionality of XOOPS. The 
main source of these modules is the XOOPS website at www.xoops.org. We will 
pick a module from each major category listed at the XOOPS website, and show 
you how to install it and set some custom values. The beauty of this is that you do 
not need to have any programming skills to accomplish this. We will look at the 
following categories of modules, which have been selected based on a combination 
of popularity and user ratings at the XOOPS website:
Communication
Information
Date and Time
Image Galleries
Entertainment
Navigation
Community
E-Commerce
We will install modules and show how they work on our demo website at 
xoopsbook.steveatwal.com.
Communication
The modules for communication are those that allow users to interact with each 
other, or those that allow you to collect information from your visitors, such as 
contact forms and polls. We will install the following module as an example:
Name: Liaise
Version: 1.26 (note that version 1.5 is not compatible with XOOPS 2.0.15)

URL: http://www.brandycoke.com/products/liaise/
Description: Liaise is a module for XOOPS that provides customizable 
contact forms, using form elements such as checkboxes and radio buttons.
For additional communication-related modules, visit the XOOPS website.
The first step will be to install the module onto our demo website as follows:
Extract the file using any software for unzipping files.
Upload the Liaise folder to the /public_html/xoopsbook/modules/ folder 
on your site using your FTP client.
Log into XOOPS on your website and then install Liaise and activate it.
Note that after installing the module, we can allow everyone to use the forms 
generated by this module, but only Webmasters can create/change/delete the forms. 
The following screenshot shows the install module page:
After the module is installed, the first thing we will do is change the name that is 
displayed on the menu for this module. The following screenshot illustrates this:
We will also change the menu link that appears across the top of our website for 
the theme we have used so that it points to this new module. First note that we 
have installed a new theme called Blue Shine from xoopsdesign.com as outlined in 
Chapter 5. Now we will add the Contact menu item for this theme as follows. We 
will change the file /public_html/xoopsbook/themes/blue_shine/theme.html 
to add:

as follows:
If you click on the link for Contact Us, you will be taken to the default 
form displayed by the Liaise module. To customize this form, navigate to the 
XOOPS administration menu at System Admin | Modules | Contact Us | Contact

As an example, we will change the following settings by clicking on Edit form 
settings for the default form that is listed:
Title of the default form: Contact Us.
Text to be displayed in the main page if more then one form is listed: Please 
use one of the forms below to contact us.
Text to be displayed in the form page itself: Send feedback to us by filling 
out this form.
We will then edit the form elements of the default form to hide unwanted fields 
and make some mandatory changes. To do this, first navigate to System Admin 
| Modules | Contact Us and click on Contact Form Listing within the XOOPS 
administration menu, and then click on Edit form elements to see the default fields 
assigned to a form, as shown in the following screenshot:

Now, if we scroll down the page in the preceding screenshot, we will see additional 
form elements and with these we will:
Uncheck the Display option for the fields Gender, How are you today, Why 
did you buy a computer, How old are you, the text field that contains the 
value starting with "I have no idea what should be placed here", What are 
your hobbies, Do you believe your government, Your credit card number.
Check the Required and Display options for the field Location. Note that this 
may not be a requirement for you; so make only those fields mandatory that 
you really want someone to fill or the user will not be able to submit the form.

Save the changes and then navigate to your website to view your Contact Us link. 
You will see the following form:
You can also create new forms from scratch by navigating to System Admin | 
Modules | Contact Us | Create a New Form. Some things you should know are:
Additional new forms will appear on the same link for the Liaise module at 
http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com/modules/liaise/. When you have 
more than one form, you will see a list of the forms instead of the actual form 
elements as can be seen in the previous screenshot. You can then click on a 
form link to display and use the actual form.
Forms can be created for many different purposes such as submitting a 
trouble ticket for a help desk, submitting an order for a restaurant, etc. The 
uses are limited only by your needs and imagination.
When a user clicks on the Submit button, information is gathered by the 
form and sent as an email to the Site Admin email address.

Information
These modules allow you to display and manage information in an easier way. 
Modules in this category include those for writing articles and posting news. We will 
install the following module as an example:
Name: News
Version: 1.44
URL: http://www.xoops.org/modules/repository/
Description: News is a module for XOOPS that allows you to easily post 
news on your website.
You can find more modules related to Information display and management at the 
XOOPS website.
As explained in the previous chapter, the first step will be to install the module onto 
our demo website as follows:
Extract the file using any unzipping software.
Upload the News folder to the /public_html/xoopsbook/modules/ folder 
on your website using your FTP client.
Log into XOOPS on your website and then install News and activate it.
The News module is likely going to be one of the modules you will want to use on 
your site. So, we will go into detail on how to create and post items into new topics 
and set the right permissions for others to see what has been posted.
We will go through the steps to show you how to:
Create a topic
Post a news item in a topic
Set viewing permissions on topics
Prune older news items
View statistics
Creating Topics
All news items are posted into topics. Thus, the first step will be to create topics 
into which you will post news items. To create a topic, navigate to System Admin | 
Modules | News | Topics Manager and scroll down to where you can see the Add 
a Topic section, as shown in the following screenshot:

[ 101 ]
When you create a new topic, you can set certain attributes of the topic such as 
assign it to a Parent Topic (to build a hierarchy of topics), and assign an image to it 
(that will be shown when the topic is displayed). Once added (using the add button), 
this new Software topic (shown in the preceding screenshot) will appear at the top of 
the News module page in a drop-down box as shown in the following screenshot:
Since we made the News module the primary module to be shown for the website 
xoopsbook.steveatwal.com in the previous chapter, using System Admin | 
Preferences | General Settings and changing Module for your start page 
from None to News, the News module will appear on the main page for 
xoopsbook.steveatwal.com.

[ 102 ]
Posting News Items
Now that we have created at least one topic, we can post news items. To post news 
items, navigate to System Admin | Modules | News | Post/Edit News, and enter a 
title and the details of a news item you wish to post. The following screenshot shows 
a sample post:
Let us look at some of the options available to us when posting a news item using the 
preceding page:
Publish in Home?: When set to Yes, this option ensures that the news item is 
shown on the home page of the News module; otherwise, the news item will 
only be shown when the Software topic is selected from the drop-down topic 
box on the home page that the user sees for this module. By default, all news 
items are shown on the home page.
•

Chapter 6
[ 103 ]
The Scoop: This is the introductory bit of the news item that is shown on 
the home page of the module, along with a Read more… link below the 
news item if the Extended Text field is used. If you would like to attach an 
image to your post, a handy image manager link is provided as part of the 
text‑formatting tools. The image manager allows you to either upload a new 
image and then select it onto the text of the news item, or select a previously 
uploaded image and post that onto the news item.
Extended Text: If you have a long news item to post, usually you would 
enter the first few paragraphs into The Scoop field and then the rest of the 
news item into the Extended Text field. This ensures that the home page of 
the News module shows as many news items as possible, and if someone is 
interested in a particular item, they can click on the Read more… link to read 
the rest of the item.
Select file to upload: This option allows one to attach a file with the 
news item.
Options: These allow the poster to automatically approve the news item 
(meaning it does not need to wait for the administrator to approve it). One 
can also set a future date and time at which this news item will be shown 
or posted at the site; this is handy if you are working on an upcoming news 
article and are not ready to show it to anyone yet. One can also set a date and 
time for expiration of the news item, which means that the news item will 
be automatically hidden as soon as the date and time of expiration passes. 
Notify by mail when published alerts the site administrator when a news 
item is posted; this is especially useful when items have been posted for 
publishing in the future, and alerts the site administrator in case that news 
item is no longer needed.
Setting View Permissions
Before anyone can see a news item or rather any news item posted in a new topic, 
you must set the view permissions for the topic. In fact, there are three types of 
permissions for news topics, which can be set using System Admin | Modules | 
News | Permissions, and which can be assigned to Anonymous Users, Registered 
Users, and Webmasters. For our site, we will:
Set Approve Permissions to Webmasters for all topics. This will allow only 
users that have full administrative access to the website to approve new news 
items. Approval means that a news item that was submitted will be shown 
on the site in the appropriate topic. Approval can also be set to Registered 
Users, which means that any registered user can submit a news item and 
have it immediately shown up on the site. This would almost be a necessity 
for a very busy site.

[ 104 ]
Set Submit Permissions to Registered Users and Webmasters for all topics. 
This will allow only registered users and Webmasters to submit news items. 
Submit permission allows users to add news items to the News module 
page. The news items would then have to be approved by the Webmasters 
before they can be seen on the website. The approve permission can also be 
assigned to registered users, and even anonymous (non-registered) visitors to 
the site. Anonymous approval is not recommended to avoid spam messages 
from advertisers where one cannot figure out who did the posting.
Set View Permissions to Anonymous Users, Registered Users, and 
Webmasters. This will allow everyone to view news items on our website. 
If you have posted a news item that is not visible on your site, then the most 
likely reason is that the view permissions for the topic have not yet been set. 
The following screenshot illustrates this:
With the permissions that you have now set, any visitor to your site can view all 
topics and news items. Anyone except anonymous users can submit a news item 
and only Webmasters can approve (or accept) news items that have been submitted 
so that they are viewable by everyone on your site. These permissions, of course, 
depend on the purpose of your site and can be changed easily to fit your needs.

Removing Old News Items
As our website grows, we will find that older news items will become less relevant, 
and we will want to remove them over time. This can be done using System Admin 
| Modules | News | Prune News. This will allow us to prune (or remove) news 
items before a certain date and from specific topics. This should be done on a routine 
basis perhaps every few months for a very busy website. If any of the news items 
need to be saved for archival purposes, then this can be done by first exporting 
the news items, using System Admin | Modules | News | Export News, before 
performing the prune.
Besides, as our website grows over time, we may want to see the number of viewers, 
number of news articles posted, and ratings assigned by viewers to news postings. 
This can be accomplished using System Admin | Modules | News | Statistics. The 
following screenshot shows some of the statistics that are produced:

Popular Modules
[ 106 ]
Date and Time
These modules allow you to display date and time-related information. We will 
install the following module as an example:
Name: extCal
Version: 2.0.13.1
URL: http://www.xoops.org/modules/repository/
Description: Calendar and events module for XOOPS that allows you to 
display a calendar on your website and add events into that calendar.
After installing this module, we will rename it to Calendar using System Admin 
| Modules. This will display a link called Calendar under the main menu. When 
someone clicks on this link, it will display a calendar with any event listed or 
highlighted on that calendar.
Similar to the News module, the Calendar module requires that you first create 
categories and then post new events into those categories. These events will have a 
start and end date and time. Older events can be pruned (or removed) using System 
Admin | Modules | Calendar | Pruning.
We will create a category called Public Holidays as follows using System Admin | 
Modules | Calendar | Category:
•
•
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 107 ]
When new Calendar events are added by a user, they will be entered into a 
particular category such as this one. In order for anyone to see these new events, 
permissions must be granted to view these categories or visitors will not see them. 
Similar to the News module, there are three kinds of permissions: view, submit, and 
auto approve. And, there are again three types of users: anonymous users, registered 
users, and Webmasters.
After the category is added, we need to first grant permissions to allow events to be 
added into this category, and then we will add some events:
Navigate to System Admin | Modules | Calendar | Permissions. We will 
set View Permissions to everyone, i.e. Anonymous Users, Registered Users, 
and Webmasters. We will set Submit Permissions to Registered Users, and 
Webmasters, and Auto Approve Permissions (so that new entries are added 
into the calendar without having to be checked by anyone) to Webmasters.
Navigate to Modules | Calendar | Event, and add an event for each public 
holiday into the Public Holidays category. For example, we will add Good 
Friday and Easter Monday as events into our Calendar. We will set the start 
date and end date to be the same for each holiday and set the start time to be 
9:00 am and the end time to be 9:30 am.
Once in a while, we will navigate to Modules | Calendar | Pruning, and remove 
older events. This process permanently removes events from the calendar prior to a 
specified date, so care should be taken if you need to retain older events.
To see what the calendar looks like with the public holiday events added for July, 2007, 
click on the Calendar link under Main Menu. You will find the following screenshot:

In addition to this, we can also show a miniature version of this calendar in a side 
block as follows:
Navigate to System Admin | Blocks.
Scroll down the page until you see Minical and click on Edit right next to it. 
Then on the next screen, set the following values:
Block Type: Side Block – Left
Visible: Yes
Visible in: Top Page
Display Images in Minical: Yes
Display Images from this Category: If you created images 
using System Admin | Images, then select a category of 
images you wish to use to display above the mini calendar. 
Note that the size of these images must be less than 120 pixels 
x 120 pixels.
Display Month: Current
Cat to Use: All Cat
To set who can view this mini calendar, navigate to System Admin | 
Groups, then click on Modify next to Anonymous Users and check on 
Minical next to Block Access Rights. This allows everyone to view this 
mini calendar. Note that if visibility is set to Registered Users, then only 
registered users and those with a higher level of permission would be able 
to view the calendar, such as Webmasters. Thus, the rule is hierarchical in 
nature with anonymous being at the bottom (with the lowest permission 
level) and Webmasters being at the top (with the highest permission level).
As a final touch, we will order the side blocks by updating the Weight field as 
follows using System Admin | Blocks:
Minical: Set Weight to 0.
Main Menu: Set Weight to 1.
User Menu: Set Weight to 2.
Login: Set Weight to 3.
Note that you may have to play with the timezone settings to display the correct day 
of the month, if your web-host provider is in a different timezone than your city. You 
can do this by navigating to System Admin | Preferences | General Settings. Our 
website at xoopsbook.steveatwal.com now looks as follows:

Image Galleries
These modules allow you to display images in an organized way on your website. 
We will install the following module as an example:
Name: myAlbum-P
Version: 2.90 Beta (2.87)
URL: http://www.peak.ne.jp/xoops/modules/mydownloads/
Description: This is a photo album module that integrates well with XOOPS. 
The developer slogan for this software is "easy to use for even the beginners".
We will install this module on our xoopsbook.steveatwal.com website and allow 
everyone to view the photos and rename the module to Albums using System 
Admin | Modules. We will go through the steps needed to set up a category of 
photos, add a few photos, and then display this album on our demo website.
The first step is to create a category using System Admin | Modules | Albums 
| Add/Edit Categories. Navigate to this page and click on the link to add a new 
category, and enter Family Trip as the Name. If we have lots of categories, we 
can create a hierarchy of them using the Parent field, which lets you set the parent 
category under which this particular category should appear. In our case, this will 
be a top-level category and we will not set a parent for it. The following screenshot 
illustrates this:

Next, click on the + icon under the images column next to this new category name. 
This will allow you to add photos. Images cannot be larger than 1024 pixels x 1024 
pixels. This will take you to a new screen that will allow you to add an image from 
your computer into your new photo album. Select Category of Family Trip, click 
the Browse button to select an image from your computer, select No turn for image 
rotation (a useful feature in case your images need to be rotated before being shown 
on your website), and click Submit (the Preview button allows you to see what your 
image will look like before it is uploaded on your website). The following screenshot 
illustrates this:

Chapter 6
[ 111 ]
After adding a category and a few photos, your demo website will have a link under 
Main Menu called Albums. To see these photos, one last step is left; set permissions 
under System Admin | Modules | Albums | Global Permissions. For anyone to 
see the categories and photos in them, we will ensure that the View Rate option is 
turned on for Anonymous Users, Registered Users, and Webmasters. In addition, 
we will turn on the Vote and Tell a Friend options for everyone, and the Post option 
for Registered Users and Webmasters. These options allow visitors to rate and vote 
on the quality of the photos. Note that, by default, the Webmasters group has full 
access to all options. This is shown in the following screenshot:
Now, if you click on the Album link under Main Menu, you will see the photos you 
added as can be seen in the following screenshot:

[ 112 ]
We will not discuss the other options for myAlbum-P in detail, as they are fairly 
self-explanatory. However, the following is a brief overview of additional 
functionality and options provided by myAlbum-P:
Photo Management allows you to remove photos previously added into 
photo albums, or change their properties such as category, submitter, date 
and time added.
•

Chapter 6
[ 113 ]
Submitted Photos allows you to accept or remove photos submitted 
by anyone other than Webmasters (if those people have been granted 
permission to submit photos).
Check Configuration & Environment shows the status of the myAlbum-
P installation. Any status check displayed in anything other than in green 
indicates a problem, and should be checked with your web-host provider.
Batch Register allows you to add photos that already exist on your web 
server into your photo album(s).
Rebuild Thumbnails allows thumbnails to be created again, just in case you 
need to.
Import Images allows you to import images already created using the 
XOOPS image manager under System Admin | Images.
Export Images allows you to export images from myAlbum-P into the 
XOOPS image manager found under System Admin | Images.
Global Permissions allows you to set permissions for access to photo albums 
for anonymous users, registered users, and Webmasters.
Blocks & Groups Admin allows you to add special blocks on your website 
such as a Random Photo block.
Preferences is listed as a link when you are on any of the preceding pages, 
and allows you to set general options such as location of photos on your 
web server.
Entertainment
Games and other fun modules can be added to your website to provide a little 
entertainment. We will install the following popular game module as an example:
Name: Frozen Bubble
Version: 1.3
URL: http://www.xoops.org/modules/repository/viewcat.php?cid=105
Description: Based on the Linux game by Guillaume Cottenceau, this is a 
simple but addictive game. More information on the original Linux game can 
be found at http://www.frozen-bubble.org.
Again, we will install this module on our xoopsbook.steveatwal.com website and 
allow anyone to access it. Note, however, that the module only allows registered 
users, who have logged in, to save their scores.

To play the game, simply click on the Frozen Bubble link under Main Menu. This 
will display the following screen:
A few things to note before diving into this game:
Visit www.java.com and install the latest Java software for your web browser. 
This will ensure that the game loads and works properly in your web 
browser, since it is a Java-based game.
To start the game, click on the Frozen Bubble logo and then press the up 
arrow key on your keyboard. The up arrow key is the Fire key.
The object of the game is to pop all the bubbles before you can proceed to the 
next level. To pop the bubbles, you must join three bubbles of the same color. 
Other than that, use the left and right-arrow keys to line up your shot and the 
up arrow key to fire. Very simple, but also very addictive once you 
start playing.

There are only two options: Store Scores Offline (leave at the default No or your 
scores will not be saved), and Repeat Player's Name in Highscores (leave at the 
default Yes to get details of who reached a certain level in the game). The results 
of the scores can be displayed from the Main Menu by first clicking on the Frozen 
Bubble link and then the Highscores link under the Frozen Bubble menu.
Navigation
Modules in this category allow you to provide easier navigation of your website, 
such as customized menus and sitemaps. We will install the following module as an 
example:
Name: Sitemap
Version: 1.13
URL: http://www.xoops.org/modules/repository/viewcat.php?cid=62
Description: This module will list the pages on our website, organized in 
hierarchical fashion. This will help visitors, and search engine robots, to find 
pages on the site. A sitemap provides a link to all important pages on a site, 
and those pages can be reached using only two links from the home page: 
using the link to the sitemap, and using a link from the sitemap page to the 
target page.
The process to install modules should be very familiar by now, and we will install 
this module on our xoopsbook.steveatwal.com website as we have done earlier. 
Installation will add a menu item called Sitemap under Main Menu. When you click 
on this menu item, it will display links to content created by all installed modules, 
such as shown in the following screenshot:
•

Popular Modules
[ 116 ]
Since this module automatically generates a sitemap, you don't need to do anything 
special to use it. However, you may want to take a look at the options available 
under System Admin | Modules | Sitemap | Preferences. The screen at System 
Admin | Groups can be used to set the groups that have Module Access Rights, 
which will determine who will be allowed to view the sitemap generated by this 
module. Normal practice is to allow Module Access Rights for all visitors and 
System Admin Rights to only Webmasters. On the page for Sitemap | Preferences, 
we will display an introductory Message such as This is a map of our website, so 
that content can be found more easily. Please click on a link below to view more 
detailed information.
Community
There are modules listed in both the Community and Communication categories 
that allow you to build a community of users that can interact with each other online. 
One such module, which is actually listed under Communication, is the newBB 
module. We will install this module as an example explaining how it can be used to 
build a community that communicates online:
Name: newBB
Version: 2.0.2
URL: http://www.xoops.org/modules/repository/viewcat.php?cid=20
Description: This module will allow you to create online discussion forums.

We will install this module on our xoopsbook.steveatwal.com website with access 
given to all visitors and administration limited to Webmasters. Once this module is 
installed in the same manner as outlined earlier and renamed to Forums, then under 
System Admin | Modules | Forums there are three main options that you will use: 
Categories, Forums, and Permissions.
Click on System Admin | Modules | Forums | Categories to create a new 
high-level category into which forums (that contain messages posted by users) will 
be listed. Example categories that we will create will be Best Open-Source Software 
and Popular Modules for XOOPS, as shown in the following screenshot:
Note that the Global Access Level option in the preceding screenshot determines 
who can view this category on our website. Forums contain the actual messages 
posted by users. For example, some forums under Best Open Source Software 

Popular Modules
[ 118 ]
might be Multimedia, CD/DVD Tools, and Desktop Enhancements. When 
someone posts a message, it will be posted into one of these forums. Navigate to 
System Admin | Modules | Forums and then click on the Forums tab. Create a few 
forums within the categories created previously by clicking on the + Forum symbol 
under the Add column next to the category name. We will create forums named 
Multimedia, CD/DVD Tools, and Desktop Enhancements under the category Best 
Open Source Software. We will create forums named Community, Entertainment, 
and Information under the category Popular Modules for XOOPS.
When you create a new forum, there are options listed at the bottom of the page to 
set permissions on who can view, edit, reply, and post items into the new forum. 
The permissions you set will depend on your needs. The following screenshot 
illustrates this:
Now, when the Forums link is clicked from the main page of your demo website at 
xoopsbook.steveatwal.com, users will see the following:

E-commerce
E-commerce modules allow you to do online business by allowing you to create a 
store, collect money, and process orders. We will install the following module as 
an example:
Name: Kshop
Version: 2.03
URL: http://www.kaotik.biz
Description: This module will allow you to add a store to your website. 
Kshop is an e-commerce module based on Freznoshop, a small but highly 
customizable shop.
We will set the following preferences using System Admin | Modules | Preferences 
(pop-up menu):
Debug set to No. This is used to provide extra information about kshop in 
case of operational problems with the software.
Kshop Name set to the name of your website or a meaningful name of your 
shop, e.g. "Fresh Grocery".
Email for Orders, Email for Contact set to a valid email address for 
your website.
Currency set to the name of the currency in your country, e.g. CDN 
for Canada.
Before you can start selling products on your website, you will need to create 
categories and also add products into those categories using System Admin | 
Modules | Kshop | Categories and System Admin | Modules | Kshop | Products, 
respectively. Products that are on sale can also be given a Special Price for a new 
product, and they will show as being on a special sale price on the website. Note that 
before anyone can see this new module, you will have to set Module Access Rights 
using System Admin | Groups for both Anonymous Users and Registered Users. 
The following screenshot shows the module in action after a search for apples:

Please note that when taking orders online, you must add an SSL certificate or enable 
an SSL certificate for your hosted website. An SSL certificate allows your website to 
encrypt data before it is transmitted from the user to your web server.
Summary
As you can see from the modules that we have covered, there is a wide variety of 
additional functionality that can be easily added to your site. This is one of the key 
benefits of XOOPS. There are many other modules available at www.xoops.org, if 
you do not find what you need here. Modules are available for gathering visitor 
statistics and adding a help-desk function, as well as smaller modules such as those 
for displaying the weather. There are also software engineers available, for a price, 
to custom-build modules that meet your particular requirements. Some of these 
software engineers can be found at:

The first thing to do will be to decide the modules that you want to use based on 
the functionality they provide for your corporate employees. For our fictional 
corporate entity, we will use all of the modules in the IntranetPack except for 
SmartFAQ and SmartSection, the functionality of which we should be able to 
replace using the DokuWiki. We have already discussed the News module in 
Chapters 4 and 6, so we will not go over it here. It is the main module being used at 
http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com. All the other modules will also be installed at 
http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com.
Configuring the CBB Module
The CBB module will allow you to add an integrated discussion forum to your 
intranet. You can allow users who have registered on your XOOPS website to read 
and post messages in any of the forums you create with CBB.
Some of the features of this module include:
Creating an unlimited number of forum categories
Creating an unlimited number of discussion forums within each 
forum category
Allowing users to subscribe to RSS feeds generated by each forum; RSS feeds 
allow your users to see information posted in the categories without the need 
to visit your website
A WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor that allows your users to 
post entries into forums; in other words, your users do not need to have any 
prior HTML or programming knowledge
Setting user permissions for each forum, so that users can either be allowed 
to view entries only, or view and reply to posts, or can also be allowed to 
create their own new discussion topics
We have already installed this module in Chapter 6, so we shall not go over how 
to do this again (in fact, you do not need to install this module if it is already 
installed). Here we will show how to create and activate two categories called Best 
Open‑Source Software and Popular Modules for XOOPS. To accomplish this, 
log into the XOOPS administrative interface for your website and then navigate 
to System Admin | Modules | Forums | Categories and click on Create a New 
Category. The result is shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
[ 125 ]
We will also create a few discussion forums within these categories. Messages that 
users post are put into forums rather than into categories; so before anyone can post 
a message, the forums will have to be created by navigating to System Admin | 
Modules | Forums | Forums and then clicking on the + forum button under the 
Add column next to a category. The following screenshot shows the forums that 
have been created:

Case Study: An Intranet Portal
[ 126 ]
You can also create subforums, i.e. forums listed within forums in a hierarchical 
fashion, using the + subforum button next to each forum. The arrow next to each 
forum, under the Move column, is used to move a particular forum to a different 
category or move the forum so that it becomes a subforum of another forum. The 
following screenshot illustrates this:
Unless you correctly set the permissions for each forum after it is created, none 
of these forums will be useable, nor can anyone post any discussion message or 
start a message thread. This has already been shown in earlier chapters, so we will 
not go through the steps again in detail on how to assign permissions. Note that 
Webmasters can create more categories and different permissions can be assigned to 
different groups.
For our categories, we will edit each category and set the following permissions:
Category access: Allow all users (anonymous users, registered users, and 
Webmasters) to view all categories created. These "Global Access Level" 
permissions can be seen when you create or edit a category.
Anonymous users are those who are not known to our 
intranet. Registered users are users that have an account on 
our intranet and have logged in. Webmasters are users that 
have administrative access to our intranet.
For our forums, we will edit each forum and set the following permissions:
Global access level: Allow all users (anonymous users, registered users, 
and Webmasters) to view all forum names created.
Can view: Allow all users (anonymous users, registered users, and 
Webmasters) to view all forum messages created by users.

Chapter 7
[ 127 ]
Can start new topics: Allow only registered users and Webmasters 
to create a new message topic in all forums. Allowing anonymous 
users to do this is inviting trouble, since your XOOPS website has not 
collected any information (such as name and email address) from these 
users; hence, it is extremely difficult to track who may have created an 
offending new topic.
Can reply: Allow only registered users and Webmasters to reply to 
discussion messages posted in your forums. Allowing anonymous users 
to do this is inviting trouble, as mentioned previously.
Can edit/Can delete: Allow only Webmasters to edit and delete posted 
messages in your forums.
Can add poll: Depending on your needs, you may allow registered users as 
well as Webmasters to create polls.
Can vote: Allow only registered users and Webmasters to respond to 
polls in your forums. Allowing anonymous users to do this may invalidate 
your responses.
Can attach: Allow only registered users and Webmasters to attach files to 
any messages they post in your forums.
Can post without approval: Allow only registered users and Webmasters to 
post messages, without those messages being first approved by Webmasters.

The following screenshot shows the CBB module in action:
Configuring the DokuWiki Module
The DokuWiki module will allow users to contribute to a manual-type document by 
creating, editing, and linking pages similar to http://wikipedia.org. This allows 
many people to collaborate on the same information, so that anybody can add or edit 
information. The information you wish to create may be company policies, employee 
handbooks, technical information, as well as anything else you can think of. Wikis 
are becoming increasingly popular.
Some of the features of this module include:
You can create as many new, unlimited-length pages as you wish.
Users edit all the pages themselves, so that the DokuWiki module is not 
maintained by one person.
•
•

Chapter 7
[ 129 ]
You can assign permissions to your users, or groups of users, to allow them 
to read, edit, create, upload, and delete content in your DokuWiki.
To install this module, follow the same procedures as before, i.e. upload the 
folder DokuWiki from the uncompressed IntranetPack folder, to the 
/public_html/xoopsbook/modules/ folder on your website.
After uploading the module, we will install this module using the XOOPS 
administration menu Modules Administration. We will then use System Admin | 
Groups to ensure that the following permissions are set for DokuWiki:
Webmasters: Module Admin Rights and Module Access Rights (should be 
set by default)
Registered Users: Module Access Rights
A few files have to be first created before the DokuWiki can be used. We can do this 
by navigating to Modules Administration | DokuWiki | Index (pop-up menu) and 
then clicking on the Create link next to each index file. The folders and files created 
by this method are:
/home/steveatw/public_html/xoopsbook/uploads/dokuwiki/
/home/steveatw/public_html/xoopsbook/uploads/dokuwiki/pages/
/home/steveatw/public_html/xoopsbook/uploads/dokuwiki/attic/
/home/steveatw/public_html/xoopsbook/uploads/dokuwiki/
changes.log
Next, we set the permissions for who can read, edit, create, upload, and delete 
content in the new Wiki. Allowing anonymous users to read the Wiki will depend on 
your company policy. For our purposes, we navigate to System Admin | Modules | 
DokuWiki | Permissions and set the following permissions:
Anonymous Users: No access
Registered Users: All Access, i.e. read, edit, create, upload, and delete content
Webmasters: All Access, i.e. read, edit, create, upload, and delete content
When we navigate to our intranet at http://xoopsbook.steveatwal.com, we 
will see a link under the main menu for DokuWiki. We click on this link and see 
that, initially, there will be nothing on our new Wiki, as shown in the following 
screenshot, so we will need to click on the Create this page button to create our first 
entry. When we create a new page, you simply need to enter the text for that page 
and a new entry will appear on the main page of DokuWiki. Each Wiki software 
system, including DokuWiki, has certain syntax for entering information. You need 
to know the syntax for DokuWiki to make full use of it. To find out more about this 
syntax, navigate to http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:syntax.

After entries have been created, Webmasters can change permissions on those entries 
by clicking on the Admin button and then the Access Control List Management 
link. The following screenshot explains this:

Chapter 7
[ 131 ]
In the preceding screenshot, namespaces are basically like containers that contain 
the pages created within the DokuWiki. When all pages within a namespace are 
removed, the namespace ceases to exist. Permissions can be set on namespaces or on 
individual pages of the DokuWiki. You can also select the groups of users to assign 
the permissions to, so that the right group of users will be able to read, edit, create, 
upload, or delete the pages in the namespace (or page) selected.
Full documentation for DokuWiki and the syntax needed to create a 
full-featured Wiki for your corporate needs can be found at 
http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki.
Configuring the MultiMenu Module
The MultiMenu module allows you to build customized menus with links that can 
be set to point to anywhere on your website or any other website on the Internet. 
Some of the features of the MultiMenu module include:
You can use four menu blocks that can be configured independently.
You can add an unlimited number of links.
Links can be to anything on the Internet.
The following screenshot shows the default view of MultiMenu inside the 
administrative panel on our intranet at System Admin | Modules | MultiMenu | 
multiMenu 01:
•
•
•

Case Study: An Intranet Portal
[ 132 ]
To change the default names of the menu, navigate to System Admin | Modules | 
MultiMenu | Preferences. We shall display the first three menu groups and name 
them as follows: multiMenu 01 will be named Search Engines, multiMenu 02 will 
be named Company Wiki, multiMenu 03 will be named Company E-Store. We have 
turned off the other menus by setting their display value to No. This is shown in the 
following screenshot:
We have set the menu to be displayed in the main page of our website to none. 
However, we will show the MultiMenu with a link in our header by updating the 
code in our /public_html/xoopsbook/themes/blue_shine/theme.html file to 
include the following two highlighted lines of code that will display a new link 
between the Forum and Contact Us links:

Chapter 7
[ 133 ]
<td id="headmenu"><a class="menuHead" 
href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/newbb/">Forum</a></td>
<td class="separator"></td>
<td id="headmenu"><a class="menuHead"

Custom Menus</a></td>
<td class="separator"></td>
<td id="headmenu"><a class="menuHead" 
href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/liaise/">Contact Us</a></td>
We have created a few custom menu links and they are shown in the following 
screenshot. Here, we have created two new custom menus, namely Search 
Engines and Company Wiki. These custom menus contain two links and one link, 
respectively, i.e. the Search Engines menu has two menu items, one for Google 
and one for Yahoo. These menu items were created by navigating to Modules | 
DokuWiki | Search Engines and then clicking on the New Link button for each 
menu. Play with this module to see what you need for your own website.
Configuring the piCal Module
The piCal module allows you to show a calendar on your website and display events 
for each day of the calendar. Features of this module include the following:
Allows all day events
Allows recurring events
Allows users to submit events
Allows you to see the calendar with a daily, weekly, or monthly view
•
•
•
•

Case Study: An Intranet Portal
[ 134 ]
Install the module just like any other module. Below is the piCal in action on our 
demo website, where we have changed the name to be displayed from piCal to 
Events Calendar. The default view is a Monthly View, which can be changed by 
going to System Admin | Modules | Calendar | General Settings of piCal within 
the XOOPS administration menu.
To add a new event, all one has to do is click on the pencil icon on a particular date 
and then enter the information for the event. The following screenshot illustrates 
this. This assumes that you have set the permissions as to who is allowed to access 
this module using System Admin | Groups. For example, Webmasters and 
Registered Users may be allowed to add events, and Anonymous Users may only be 
allowed to view them.

Chapter 7
[ 135 ]
You can set a Summary (that appears on the calendar), a detailed description, a start 
date and time, and an end date and time.
Before you can post events into the calendar, you must set the required permissions 
using the Modules | Calendar | Group's Permissions menu. You can assign 
permissions so that registered users, Webmasters, or even anonymous users can 
post. The following screenshot shows the Group's Permissions screen.

[ 136 ]
Configuring the WF-Downloads Module
The WF-Downloads module creates an area on your website where your users 
can download files that you have copied onto your website, or create links to files 
on other websites. These files can be anything you would like to share with your 
corporate users. Main features of this module are:
You can create categories and subcategories of files.
Users can upload files.
You can set permissions on categories and files.
We will install this on our demo website so that Webmasters have Admin Rights, 
and everyone else has Access Rights, i.e. are able to view the categories and files. 
Permissions can be set on categories and subcategories to refine who can view and 
upload files.
Probably the first thing you will want to do is create a few categories for the various 
types of downloadable files you make available on your intranet. Navigating to 
System Admin | Modules | WF-Downloads | Category Management will allow us 
to create these categories. In our sample site, we have created Anti-virus Software 
and Office Productivity Software as two categories. We then assign permissions 
using System Admin | Modules | WF-Downloads | Permissions so that all users 
are able to view and download files, except for anonymous users.

Following is a screenshot of the WF-Downloads module in action on our 
demo website:
Configuring the XoopsPoll Module
The XoopsPoll module allows you to create polls for your users where they can cast 
their vote on any subject you wish to have feedback on. Some nice features of this 
module are:
A simple clean interface using the System Admin | Modules | Polls | Add 
Poll options within the XOOPS administration
Allows each registered user to vote only once
An expiration date and time can be set for each poll you create
To create a new poll, navigate to Modules | Polls, and then click on Add Poll to 
enter a question as well as some possible answers for users to choose from. The 
following example illustrates this:

Other Module Packages
There are other module packages that people have created in the hopes of 
providing functionality for a particular cause or type of functionality, which can 
all be downloaded from the www.xoops.org website. Following are a few of these 
packages:
PersonalPack (www.xoops.org/modules/core/singlefile.
php?cid=9&lid=101): This pack contains modules that can be used to create 
a personal website for you to tell family and friends about yourself and what 
you do.
CompanyPack (www.xoops.org/modules/core/singlefile.
php?cid=9&lid=99): This pack contains modules suitable for creating a 
company site with information about the company.
CommunityPack (www.xoops.org/modules/core/singlefile.
php?cid=9&lid=98): This pack contains modules suitable for creating a 
community site with information and options for visitors to participate in 
discussions and submit content.
CommercePack (www.xoops.org/modules/core/singlefile.
php?cid=9&lid=97): This pack contains modules suitable for creating a 
commercial site with information and options for visitors to buy products 
and services from your company.
Using a Company LDAP Server for 
Authentication
Many organizations, in their never-ending quest to simplify their operations, are 
centralizing user accounts and passwords with a central directory such as LDAP 
or Windows Active Directory. XOOPS is able to connect to these directories so that 
existing user accounts that are already set up in a corporate directory can be used to 
log into XOOPS. XOOPS will pick up these usernames and groups and allow you to 
assign permissions to modules based on them. This means that the administration 
of XOOPS is simplified and you do not need to duplicate usernames and passwords 
for all your employees within XOOPS. Just imagine having to set up three hundred 
new user accounts in XOOPS, when those accounts already exist, and then having to 
maintain those accounts as staff join or leave or require access to different modules 
and blocks!

Case Study: An Intranet Portal
[ 140 ]
To accomplish the mission of tying into your corporate directory for authentication, 
follow the steps below:
1.	 Navigate to System Admin | Preferences | Authentication Options.
2.	 Change the Authentication Method to Standard LDAP Directory (or 
Microsoft Active Directory if connecting to Active Directory).
3.	 Set the values for the other fields to match your corporate directory values. If 
you are the IT Administrator for your company, then you should know what 
these values are. If you are not the IT Administrator, then you will need to 
talk to him or her and, either ask for the information or ask him or her to set 
up this section of XOOPS. See the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
[ 141 ]
The remaining key values for this section include:
LDAP - Port Number: This is usually 389.
LDAP - Server Name: The fully qualified domain name of your LDAP 
directory server, e.g. ad.mycompany.com.
LDAP - Base DN: The base DN (Distinguished Name) of your LDAP 
directory tree. This specifies the organizational unit in your directory server 
that you wish to use. This will determine the user groups in your LDAP 
server that are allowed to log into XOOPS.
DN of the LDAP manager: The DN of the user allowed to make an LDAP 
search (e.g. manager).
Password of the LDAP manager: The password of the user allowed to make 
an LDAP search.
LDAP Version protocol: The LDAP version protocol, 2 or 3. Leave at the 
default of 3 (latest) unless you have a reason to change this.
Xoops User(s) bypass LDAP Authentication: Normally the admin account 
can log in without having to be authenticated with an outside directory 
server. This allows you to log in to administer your site when the outside 
authentication server is offline. Additional accounts can be specified here.
The Domain Name: This is your active directory domain name. Use it if you 
selected Microsoft Active Directory as the authentication method.
LDAP - Mail Field Name: The name of the E-Mail field in your LDAP 
directory tree.
LDAP - Given Name Field Name: The name of the Given Name field in 
your LDAP directory.
LDAP - Surname Field Name: The name of the Surname field in your 
LDAP directory.
You should create a separate LDAP manager name and password that is given 
access to search the LDAP directory, which could then be used for the purposes 
of connecting to your company LDAP server. This will ensure that if this account 
information is compromised, the password can be changed or the LDAP manager 
account can be removed without affecting any system other than XOOPS in 
your organization. Do not use an account that is used for other purposes, e.g. the 
administrator user ID and password for the LDAP server.
The screenshot opposite shows some of the options that you need to set for LDAP 
authentication to work.

Summary
When building an intranet, keep in mind that access should only be granted to 
registered users and Webmasters, and you may want to ensure that only users in a 
corporate LDAP directory are allowed to log into the intranet, by setting the LDAP 
options within XOOPS to match the information for your organization. As we have 
seen, the IntranetPack is a good starting point when adding useful functionality to 
your intranet. Additional modules can, of course, be added as needed, and in the 
end, what modules or functionality you use depends on your needs.
