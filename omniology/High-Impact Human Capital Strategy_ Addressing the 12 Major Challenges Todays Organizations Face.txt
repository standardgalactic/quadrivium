his new book focuses directly on how to develop a human capital (HC) strat-
egy in today’s turbulent and changing environment. Too often, HC strategy 
encompasses a classic and traditional approach to human resources (HR): recruit-
ing the best people, preparing them for assignments, motivating them for high 
performance, and retaining them for several years. While this is all necessary, it is 
more helpful to have a strategy that fits into the current environment and context. 
An HC strategy must effectively address the demographic changes in the workforce, 
current skill shortages and mismatches in labor markets, societal and structural 
shifts in organizations, the persistent energy crisis, globalization, and important 
environmental challenges. At the same time, the strategy must be feasible, action-
able, measurable, and implemented with remarkable success. This book addresses 
twelve forces that must be addressed in HC strategy.
Why This Is Necessary
No function, process, or issue in an organization is more important than the human 
capital managed by the HR department. HC strategies often make great companies, 
build great products, and deliver great services. Even in governments, a human cap-
ital strategy can make the difference between success and failure. A major part of 
the financial problem in Greece came from its HC issues, as the Greek government 
created more jobs than needed, paid far too much for them, and provided excessive 
benefits, making it easy to retire early with large pensions. At the same time, the 
accountability for the work went away. Every high school graduate wanted to work 
in a government job. The government grew, overshadowing the private sector as 
the dominant employer and leaving the country with a staggering debt that is still 
unraveling. Greece did not have an effective HC strategy.
The HR function is so important that some magazines (e.g., CFO Magazine) 
have suggested that it should be placed under the direction of the chief financial 
officer, because it represents the largest expenditure in an organization and has 
the most promise of creating a very successful and effective organization. Gartner 
Research has reported that this is now a trend.
While HC’s importance has never been higher, the image of HR is still tarnished, 
and according to some, it is at a low point. For the most part, HC strategies are 
driven by the HR executive instead of the top executives. While this is helpful and 
important for action, it marginalizes the influence of the HR executive. In some 
organizations, the view of HR is often outdated, still perceived as an administrative,

legal, and transactional process that is, at best, a necessary evil. Jack Welch, the 
former CEO of General Electric, has stated that many of his colleagues see HR as a 
“health and happiness sideshow.”1
Typical HC strategy focuses on recruiting, selection, talent development, compen-
sation, motivation, compliance, and maintenance. While these functions are obviously 
important, the dynamics of the environment where these processes occur is changing 
rapidly. Many forces contribute to an organization’s health and its employees’ well-­
being and success, and these must be addressed when developing HC strategy.
The HR function should be perceived as important, integral, and a contributing 
part of the organization. One of the best ways to improve the image of this function, 
increase its influence within the organization, and deliver unmistakable, credible 
results is to have an HC strategy that focuses on the following twelve goals:
	 1.	 Setting the optimal investment level for human capital and reviewing this 
expenditure periodically
	 2.	 Aligning HR programs to the business as they are initiated, developed, and 
implemented
	 3.	 Managing critical talent in the organization, ensuring that the appropriate 
number and quality of talented employees are available, addressing skills short-
ages, and ensuring that talent remains in the organization
	 4.	 Pursuing a program of employee satisfaction, commitment, and job engage-
ment, so that employees are fully involved in their work, remain loyal to the 
organization, and help attract others to the organization
	 5.	 Creating a performance and innovation culture to achieve results in the orga-
nization with proper direction, roles, and motivations
	 6.	 Ensuring that employees are healthy and safe with proper healthcare and well-
ness opportunities
	 7.	 Addressing the current demographics and societal issues to ensure that a 
proper employee mix is available and included in processes to enhance pro-
ductivity and innovation
	 8.	 Using technology to its fullest extent to unleash the creativity and potential 
of employees, while ensuring that it is driving productivity, innovation, and 
customer satisfaction
	 9.	 Addressing globalization in terms of how it effects employees in the present 
and will affect employees in the future, by having them actively engaged in 
every part of the process
	10.	 Addressing environmental and energy issues as they relate to jobs, the organi-
zation, and society
	 11.	 Developing effective leaders who can operate successfully in a global, diverse 
environment
	12.	 Implementing a system for accountability, including measuring success with 
analytics and big data, and delivering value that will be credible to top execu-
tives, including the chief financial officer
These imperatives are, at best, only casually mentioned in HC/HR strategy and 
execution books but represent critical processes needed to deliver value in medium 
and large organizations alike.

Who Will Benefit from This Book
HR executives, managers, and administrators—­the individuals who must develop 
an appropriate strategy and present it to the executive team—­will find this book to 
be a useful guide for developing the human capital strategy. An effective strategy 
will require several elements to be in place, and they are all described in this book. 
This book will be an indispensable tool for HR leaders to connect the HR function 
to key strategic issues in the organization and drive organizational value.
Senior executives, who must support HC strategy and take the lead in develop-
ing it, will find this book to be a helpful reference to what’s possible. These execu-
tives need to be in harmony with the strategy to support it, provide resources for it, 
and constantly reinforce and adjust it.
HR specialists, coordinators, advisors, and consultants within the organization, 
who must align HR with the strategy, will benefit from this book as well. They 
have an important input into the strategic processes, and this book will help them 
understand why the strategy is necessary. It will also help them define their roles in 
the process, execute the strategy, and deliver results.
Finally, professionals who are external to organizations will also find this book to 
be a valuable resource. This includes professors, consultants, and researchers who 
are promoting, teaching, exploring, researching, and assisting with HC strategies. 
Consultants can use it as guide to help organizations, and professors can use it as 
a textbook in MBA or HRM courses at the senior and graduate levels. Researchers 
will find this book to be a useful guide for HC strategy research.
The Flow of the Book
This book begins with two introductory chapters that set the stage for the remain-
der of the book. Chapter 1 focuses on the importance of human capital, tracking 
some of the key issues that highlight how the concept of human capital has been a 
critical issue for top executives and is the main focus of the human resources func-
tion. Chapter 2 examines the approaches to human capital strategy, outlining what 
is classically covered and the strategic issues that are always contained in current 
strategy documents. At the same time, this chapter points to the shortcomings of 
those strategic documents, highlighting that there are twelve major forces that are 
often not addressed clearly and completely.
Throughout the rest of the book, the twelve forces that are affecting businesses, 
particularly in the human capital area, are addressed one chapter at a time. Each 
chapter starts by defining the force, particularly in the context of how it affects 
human capital and the business. Next, the force is detailed in terms of its elements, 
components, principles, issues, and challenges, including the effect it is having on 
organizations. Part of the discussion is about what the human resources function 
should consider or explore. The chapter then focuses on what strategic questions 
must be addressed and what strategic statements must be included in the human 
capital strategic plan.

Acknowledgments
Jack and Patti would like to acknowledge, first and foremost, all the human 
resources executives who really make a difference. HR executives have struggled to 
be fully accepted in the C-­suite as an important part of the top executive team, but 
many have made this journey and are making great contributions. Far too many are 
not there yet, but they are working on it. We acknowledge those who have made it 
and those who are striving to make it, too numerous to mention here by name, and 
recognize that all of them are making great contributions.
We want to thank our editor, Stephen S. Power at AMACOM, who has been very 
patient with us as we developed this manuscript during a very hectic global travel 
schedule. Thanks, Stephen, for your patience and for taking on this project, our 
second book with AMACOM.
Jack would like to thank three of his former CEOs: Herbert Stockham, Carl Reg-
ister, and B. K. “Skipper” Goodwin. All three allowed Jack to experiment with many 
of the concepts in this book. Our HR function was a laboratory, ahead of its time.
We also want to recognize our staff who have contributed their efforts to this 
book, particularly Hope Nicholas, director of publications, who always juggles many 
projects. Hope is our strategy when it comes to books. Her efforts to organize, edit, 
and deliver this manuscript have been outstanding. As always, the entire ROI Insti-
tute team provided excellent support and assistance when we wrote this book.

his introductory chapter examines the importance of human capital and intro-
duces several arguments for why human capital should be a reigning priority. 
It begins by examining the role of people in organizations and then explores issues 
such as how human capital is (or is not) valued. The role of human capital in highly 
successful organizations is highlighted in lists such as Fortune’s “100 Best Companies 
to Work For” and “Most Admired Companies.” In almost all cases, logical arguments 
point toward the importance of the human part of the organization, which contrib-
utes most, if not all, of the organization’s successes. The discussion emphasizes the 
value successful organizations place on their people and their reasons for doing so.
Are People Necessary?
The beginning point in the discussion about the importance of human capital is 
to think about the value people bring to an organization. This always brings up a 
question: Are people really necessary? Of course, in practice, we all realize that 
people are critical, but should the goal be to eliminate them or let someone else 
work with them? Is it possible to automate almost everything, as some companies 
attempt to do?
People Cause Problems
It’s interesting to observe an automobile assembly line in a modern factory. There 
are no people to be seen—­just expensive and impressive robots. Why would the 
company take this approach and replace humans with robots? Is it cheaper? Is it 
because of the problems employees create? Is it because of the difficulty in finding 
qualified workers? Maybe it’s all these issues.
Some managers view the human aspect of organizations as an irritant, a burden, 
or perhaps a necessary evil. People cause most of the problems. It is the people 
who are dissatisfied, file grievances, have complaints, allege sexual harassment, get 
injured on the job, file workers compensation claims, go on strike, and create a host 
of other problems that not only take them out of service but take precious time 
and resources to resolve. Some executives have estimated that employee problems 
account for as much as 20 percent of the total cost of human capital investment. 
If the people could be removed, the problems would go away; there would be no

complaints, charges, gripes, grievances, accidents, or work stoppages. For some 
executives, this would be Utopia, and they strive to achieve this scenario.
Technology Replaces People
The advancement of equipment, machines, and technology has enabled many 
organizations to automate parts of the job—­and in some cases, all of the job. As 
technology evolves, is it possible to have a completely automated workplace? Is it 
possible to remove the human factor, at least for the most part? Consider some-
thing that would have been almost unheard of years ago: automated air travel. With 
available technology, airplanes could basically take off, fly to their destination, and 
land, completely automated. Much of the check-­in, boarding, and logistics could be 
automated, as it is now to a certain extent. It may be possible for the entire process 
(from checking in to arriving at the desired destination) to be accomplished without 
any human interaction. To some, this seems like science fiction, but it could be a real-
ity. Is this desired? Perhaps not. What happens if technology fails or there is a glitch 
in the automation? The dream becomes a nightmare. It may be impossible to remove 
the human factor in the short term, but this is a goal for many.
Automation Is Healthy
Regardless of your position on job automation, there are some jobs that should be 
eliminated; automation should be an essential and significant part of the strategy of 
deciding how much to invest in employees. Four types of jobs are ideal candidates 
for automation. First, the jobs that are considered very monotonous and boring 
should be eliminated. These jobs are routine and require little thought and concen-
tration. Many assembly-­line jobs fit into this category. If possible, these jobs should 
be automated; otherwise, the monotony leads to dissatisfaction, which leads to 
absenteeism, turnover, injuries, withdrawal, and sometimes even sickness. Employ-
ees can become sick solely because of the rote work they do.
Second, jobs that are highly dangerous should be automated. This is a critical 
issue in heavy industry, manufacturing, and mining—­using technology to remove 
the employee factor so that injuries and deaths can be prevented. This is not only 
the cost-­effective thing to do but the humane thing as well.
Third, transaction-­based jobs should be automated. These jobs involve simple-­
step transactions that can be handled much more efficiently with technology. Con-
sider the issue of booking an airline reservation—­a very transaction-­based process. 
A few years ago, it was all handled on the phone or face to face; now the majority 
of reservations are made on the Internet, thus eliminating many people who pre-
viously had to be involved in the process. Some airlines charge an additional fee 
when reservations are made via the phone, thus providing an incentive to reserve 
a seat via the Internet. The newer technology produces fewer errors and is quicker 
and less costly for the organization.
Fourth, jobs where it is difficult to recruit employees should be automated, 
if possible. Many organizations are automating processes, steps, and even entire 
functions. Consider the local service station and the job of fueling your automo-
bile. Gone are the days when three attendants ran out to your car, filled the tank, 
checked the oil, washed the windshield, put air in the tires, and took your money. 
Today, the individual consumer is familiar with the gas pump. By following a few 

The Importance of Human Capital

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
simple directions, the consumer fills the tank, pays with a credit card, and goes 
through an automatic car wash. These “modern” conveniences have enabled com-
panies to provide more efficient delivery of their gasoline. If an attendant had to 
pump the gas and take the money, the associated cost would have to be passed onto 
the consumer—­some estimate as much as 5–­10 cents per gallon. This automation 
has eliminated jobs that are hard to fill and usually have high turnover. At the same 
time, there is increased efficiency and convenience. The hours of store operation 
are no longer a consideration; you can fuel your car at any time, any day of the week. 
Some service stations are open 24/7 with no people involved in the process.
People Are Still Necessary
With the previous discussion as a backdrop, several conclusions can be reached 
about the role of people in the workplace. First, minimizing the numbers is not 
necessarily a bad strategy. In the name of efficiency, employee welfare, and the 
desire to have motivating and challenging jobs, certain jobs need to be eliminated 
or minimized.
Second, human capital investment at some level is necessary. Even in a com-
pletely automated transaction, people are involved in making key decisions, solv-
ing problems, and ensuring that the processes work correctly. The investment still 
exists; it is just that it may be a smaller percentage of the operating expenses.
Third, in a highly automated workplace, people are still critical. Sometimes their 
skills are upgraded because of problems that arise when transactions, technology, 
or equipment fails. They are also needed to coordinate and implement the new 
technology in the first place. In an ideal situation, as jobs are eliminated, skills are 
upgraded so that the workforce is maintained or, in some cases, even grows. A firm 
that has both job creation (adding jobs) and significant automation (eliminating 
jobs) is adding tremendous value to the economy, which is the challenge of many 
organizations.
The Stock Market Mystery
When considering the value and importance of human capital, executives need to 
look no further than the stock market. Investors place a tremendous value on human 
capital in organizations. For example, consider San Diego–­based QUALCOMM, a 
leader in developing and delivering innovative wireless communication products 
and services based on the company’s CDMA (code division multiple access) dig-
ital technology. The company owns significant intellectual property applicable to 
products that implement any version of CDMA. QUALCOMM is included in the 
S&P 500 Index and is a Fortune 500 company traded on the NASDAQ stock market. 
QUALCOMM is a very profitable company, with revenues in 2013 of $44.9 billion 
and a net income of $6.9 billion.1
QUALCOMM reported total assets (tangible) on its balance sheet of $45.5 bil-
lion; however, its market value is much higher. The stock price in 2014 was $75 per 
share, and the company had a market value of $120.9 billion. In essence, tangible 
assets represented only 37 percent of the market value, even though they included 
not only the current assets of cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and 
inventories but also property, plants, equipment, and even goodwill.

4

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Thus investors see something in QUALCOMM that has a value much greater 
than the assets listed on the balance sheet. This “hidden value,” as it is sometimes 
called, comes from the intangible assets, which now represent a major portion 
of the value of organizations, particularly those in knowledge industries, such as 
QUALCOMM. It is helpful to understand what makes up intangible assets; human 
capital is certainly a big part of it.
A Brief History of Valuing Human Capital
The concern for the value of human capital can be traced back many years, but this 
concern gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the form of human 
resources accounting.2 Although interest diminished in the early 1980s, human 
resources accounting (HRA) enjoyed renewed emphasis in the late 1980s and con-
tinued strong throughout the 1990s. Human resources accounting was originally 
defined as a process designed to identify, measure, and communicate information 
about human resources in order to facilitate effective management within an orga-
nization. It was an extension of accounting principles—­matching costs, revenues, 
and organizational data to communicate relevant information in financial terms. 
With HRA, employees are viewed as assets or investments for the organization. 
Methods of measuring these assets are similar to those of other assets; however, the 
process includes the concept of accounting for the condition of human capabilities 
and their value.
In the 1980s, organizations began developing case studies describing their appli-
cation of HRA principles. For example, UpJohn used HRA to measure and forecast 
the return on investment in people. Even professional baseball teams began to 
use the concept to place a value on their talent. Three important questions placed 
HRA under scrutiny: Are human beings assets? What costs should be capitalized? 
What methods are most appropriate for establishing a value for employees with the 
eventual allocation of such values to expenses?3
In 1986, Karl Erik Sveiby, manager and owner of a Swedish-­based publishing 
company, published The Knowledge Company, a book that explains how to manage 
these intangible assets.4 It was one of the first books to focus on “intellectual cap-
ital,” and it inspired other critical research in Europe. In Asia, the idea developed 
as firms attempted to show the value of their intangible assets. Japan’s Hiroyuki 
Itami published an analysis of the performance of Japanese companies.5 His study 
concluded that much of the difference in the performance of firms comes from 
intangible assets. In 1991, Skandia AFS, an insurance firm in Sweden, organized the 
first known corporate Intellectual Capital Office, naming Lief Edvinsson its first 
vice president for intellectual capital.6 Edvinsson’s mission was to learn how others 
were managing intellectual capital and using it to generate profits.
Major changes in the economy and organizations have created a tremendous 
interest in human capital. In the last century, the economy has moved from agri-
cultural to industrial to knowledge-­based, as shown in Figure 1.1.7 The knowledge 
era is perhaps the most far-­reaching and explosive of the economic eras.
During the agricultural era, the focus of production was on land and how to 
make it more productive. During the industrial age, which dominated much of the 
first half of the twentieth century, the focus of production was on how efficiency

and profits could be generated through the use of machinery. In the knowledge 
economy, the focus of production is on the human mind and how knowledge is 
used to build a more productive and efficient economy. Some researchers have 
labeled the knowledge economy as the talent economy, dominated by talent 
organizations.
Talent organizations are those that have no or few natural resources and very 
little physical capital. In 1963, for example, there were only a handful of companies 
that met this category, such as IBM, Eastman Kodak, Proctor & Gamble, and RCA. 
By 2013, more than half of the top fifty companies were talent based, including three 
of the four biggest: Apple, Microsoft, and Google. Truly, this knowledge-­based or 
talent-­based economy is where the value of human capital really shines.8
When it comes to classifying intangible assets, there is no agreement on the 
specific categories; the assets are important and varied. A large technology com-
pany, such as QUALCOMM, has a market value far exceeding the actual book value 
that reflects its tangible assets. Important intangible categories make up this huge 
difference in value, and a big part of this is human capital.
The first step to understanding the issue is to clearly define the difference 
between tangible and intangible assets. As presented in Table 1.1, tangible assets are 
required for business operations and are readily visible, rigorously quantified, and 
represented as a line item on a balance sheet.9 Intangible assets are key to enjoying 
a competitive advantage in the knowledge era and are invisible, difficult to quantify, 
and not tracked through traditional accounting practices. With this distinction, it 
is easier to understand the different categorizations.
Intellectual capital was earlier defined as the intangible assets that could be con-
verted to profit. This concept has created a tremendous interest in understanding 
the impact of the knowledge contribution of successful organizations. Although 
there are more than a dozen ways to classify intangible assets, some categories are 
common between the groupings; three variations are presented here. A widely

accepted grouping is contained in Figure 1.2, where the enterprise is divided into 
tangible assets, intellectual capital, and financial capital.
In this arrangement, intellectual capital is divided into customer capital, human 
capital, and structural capital. Thomas Stewart, Leif Edvinsson, Hubert Saint-­Onge, 
and many others support this division. Figure 1.3 shows the elements of intellectual 
capital offered by another researcher/practitioner in the field.10 This categoriza-
tion includes research and development, intellectual assets, and knowledge, with 
knowledge being divided into tacit knowledge and codified knowledge.
Still another definition comes from Thomas Stewart,11 who suggests that human 
capital has three elements:
•	 Collective skills. These represent the talents of individuals, colleagues, and 
teams. This essentially reflects the capability to build on the skills of others.
•	 Communities of practice. Organizations are made up of communities, and 
these communities of professional practice have become a recognized part of 
business life. The nature of knowledge will require companies to foster commu-
nities where there is a high level of candor and where corporate doublespeak 
has no place.
•	 Social capital. What transforms workers into colleagues is social capital. It is the 
stock of active connections among people—­the trust, mutual understanding, 
and shared values and behaviors that make cooperative action possible.
Whatever the definition, human capital is a significant part of intellectual 
capital, and intellectual capital is an important part of intangible assets. For 
organizations—­especially knowledge-­based organizations—­intangible assets are 
often far greater than tangible assets. The bottom line is that we are in the know­
ledge era. Knowledge comes from humans—­not machines, financial resources, or 
natural resources.

The Accounting Dilemma
One of the problems of attempting to place a value on human capital stems from 
accounting standards. Both financial accounting (which appears in annual reports) 
and management accounting (which enables managers to take action) are inad-
equate for current organizations. Although there has been much discussion, the 
general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) offered by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) are inadequate for placing a value on intangible assets, 
particularly human capital. Even Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board, complained that accounting was not tracking investments of 
intellectual assets and that technology change has muddied the crucial distinction 
between capital assets and ordinary expenses. FASB indicates that accounting’s 
fundamental purpose is to provide information that is useful in making rational 
investment, credit, and disposal decisions. That is not happening. If the books were 
communicating stories that investors found useful, then a company’s market value 
would correlate with the value accountants place on it. The QUALCOMM example 
illustrates the tremendous difference between market value and book value.

share prices.12 He concluded that the financial reporting methods used by nearly 
all corporations—­the methods codified by the FASB and required of public com-
panies by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—­were giving “exactly 
the wrong impression” of the real comparative worth of corporations. In growth 
industries, in particular, the accounting numbers consistently overstated the value 
of physical assets (like buildings and machinery) and consistently underestimated 
other assets, especially the intangibles that were, in the early 1990s, just coming to 
be seen as critical sources of corporate competitiveness. The debate will continue 
as the accounting profession tries to adjust to the new economy.
The Expanded Role of Human Capital
The press is exploding with coverage of human capital. The number of documents 
produced containing the term human capital increased from almost 700 in 1993 
to more than 8,000 in 2003 to well over 25,000 in 2013. This growth in coverage 
emphasizes the importance of human capital in the management of organizations.
In the 2013 “Conference Board CEO Challenge,” 729 CEOs provided input on 
their most pressing issues.13 Human capital was the number-­one issue from a global 
perspective. An earlier study conducted by IBM in 2012, “Leading Through Connec-
tions: Insights from the Global Chief Executive Officer,”14 also identified human cap-
ital as the number-­one issue. A total of 1,700 CEOs were involved in this study. Even 
though the term human capital is commonplace in organizations, management’s

role in this important resource is often unclear. This lack of clarity lends to the 
mystery of human capital, where investment in this resource now commands much 
executive time and attention.
The management community has a broader view of human capital. For example, 
The Human Resources Glossary defines human capital as the return an organiza-
tion gains from the loyalty, creativity, effort, accomplishments, and productivity of 
its employees.15 It equates to, and may actually exceed, the productive capacity of 
machine capital and investment in research and development.
Human capital represents the relationship between what organizations invest in 
employees and the organization’s emerging success. The relationship to success is the 
mystery. Imagine this scenario: The CEO of a $5-­billion-­revenue company proposes to 
its board of directors that the company make an investment of $1.8 billion for the com-
ing year. When describing the investment, the CEO is optimistic that the returns will 
follow, although he does not know how much of a return will be realized and cannot 
estimate it reliably. However, he is confident that the investment is needed and that 
it will pay off for the company. The executive explains that this investment, which 
represents almost 40 percent of the company’s revenues, is based on benchmarked 
data that show other firms are making similar investments. Even when the investment 
is made and the consequences are realized, the CEO suggests that the value of this 
investment may still be unknown. Nevertheless, he asks for the money.
The investment in question is the investment in human capital. As extreme 
as it may seem, this scenario plays out in organizations each year as they invest in 
their workforce. Budget approvals are granted on faith, assuming that the requested 
investment will pay off. Far too much mystery shrouds the connection between the 
investment in employees and the success that follows. Human capital analytics can 
make this connection.
Struggles of the Human Resources Function
Despite the importance of human capital—­and likely due to the ambiguity sur-
rounding investment in it and the lack of progress in measuring it properly—­the 
human resources function has had its share of criticism in recent years. Almost two 
decades ago, a major article in Fortune essentially said the HR function was irrele-
vant.16 Thomas Stewart, the respected Fortune editor who wrote the article, said that 
the HR function should be eliminated and the essential transactions should be per-
formed by other functions or outsourced altogether. As the author bluntly described 
the situation, “Chances are its leaders are unable to describe their contribution to 
value added except in trendy, unquantifiable, and wannabe terms. . . . I am describing 
your human resource department and have a modest proposal: Why not blow it up?” 
Stewart reached this conclusion, in part, because HR had failed to show its value.
Although some may argue that this view is extreme, the article served as 
a wake-­up call for HR executives looking for a better way to show value in the 
organization—­that is, to show the contribution of the human resources function.
As critics ask for more measurement and accountability, the HR function has 
been under pressure, internally, to show value. Because the investment is quite 
large, many top executives ask HR executives to show the contribution to avoid 
budget cuts. In some cases, managers must demonstrate contribution in order to 
increase the budget or fund specific projects. When funding occurs, executives want 

10	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
to see the actual return. However compassionate executives are about people and 
the role of people in the organization, they are also driven by the need to generate 
profits; enhance resource allocation; build a successful, viable organization; and 
survive in the long term. The philosophy of caring for employees and striving for 
results appears, to some, to be counterintuitive. It is not. Caring and accountability 
work together, as will be demonstrated many times in this book.
The typical human resources reaction to this movement toward HR account-
ability has been unimpressive. HR functions have resisted the call for additional 
accountability in many ways. Some argue that people are not widgets, so they cannot 
be counted in the same way as products. Some consider the issue of accountability 
inappropriate and maintain that we should not attempt to analyze the role of people 
with financial concepts. They argue that the issues are too “soft,” and much of what is 
invested in human capital will have to be taken on faith; investments must be made 
based on intuition, logic, and what others have invested. Still other executives simply 
do not know how to address this issue. They are not as familiar with the organization 
as they should be, lack the necessary knowledge in operations and finance, and are 
unprepared for this type of challenge. Their backgrounds do not include assign-
ments in which measurement and accountability are critical to success. Some do not 
understand the measurement issue and what can and should be done.
The signs indicate that resistance is diminishing. The focus on human capital 
analytics is contributing to a paradigm shift as human capital measurement and 
investment take on a new life. Table 1.2 illustrates this paradigm shift from the 
Table 1.2.  Human capital perspectives.

traditional view of human capital to the present view. These shifts are dramatic for 
the human resources function. They underscore how the HR function is evolving to 
show the importance of human resources and its connection with business results. 
Human capital analytics makes this possible.
The Chief Financial Officer’s Perspective
When investments are made, the chief financial officer (CFO) takes notice. Typi-
cally, the CFO is involved in investment decisions such as predicting them up front, 
auditing the success afterward, and reporting them to top executives, directors, and 
shareholders. However, the concept of human capital places the CFO in an awk-
ward position. CFOs realize that companies make a heavy investment in this area, 
yet few finance or accounting executives understand it in any detail or know how 
the investment creates value for the business. Studies conducted by CFO Magazine 
show that less than 20 percent of companies surveyed say they have little more than 
a moderate understanding of the return on human capital investments.17 In many 
organizations, traditionally accepted finance and accounting practices cannot be 
used for their largest investment, human capital. Despite the CFO’s emerging role 
as the chief resource allocator who helps direct the resources to the most produc-
tive investment, human capital remains a vast area of spending where the finance 
function offers little insight beyond guidance on what the company can afford to 
spend. Here is where a human capital analytics function, sponsored or supported 
by the CFO, can make a difference.
The Last Major Source of Competitive Edge
Most executives realize the importance of human capital in some way. They under-
stand the fact that the other sources of capital in the organization such as finance, 
technology, and access to markets are basically the same, regardless of the organi-
zation. One particular organization does not necessarily have unique access to the 
other types of capital. The differentiator of most organizations is human capital, 
thus making it the last source of competitive advantage. It is how the organization 
attracts, maintains, motivates, and retains the knowledge, skills, and creative capa-
bility of employees that drives organizational success. Without a doubt, human cap-
ital is critical, but in today’s environment, a greater understanding of it is essential 
in order to make the appropriate investment.
Barriers to Change
Several major barriers prevent organizations from treating human capital as a true 
investment. First is the failure to “walk the talk.” In brochures, handbooks, manuals, 
and HR programs, executives proudly proclaim employees as their greatest asset, 
but they do not necessarily walk the talk. They treat employees as expenditures 
and investments in employees as expenses in the organization, quickly trimming 
employee numbers to save costs and to drive revenue.
The second barrier is ownership: Who actually owns human capital manage-
ment? For many years, it has been the human resources function. Executives have 
turned to HR to claim ownership for and make improvements in this important 
area. However, for the human capital investment to be successful, it must be owned 

12	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
by the entire organization and managed by the senior executives. HR managers and 
senior executives must take a role in ensuring that proper solutions are in place, the 
appropriate measures are tracked, and improvement is generated. It also means 
that chief financial officers and operating executives all have important roles in this 
process to ensure that it functions properly.
The third major barrier to change is the failure to consider the dynamics of the 
human capital investment. A variety of programs and projects are often imple-
mented with little or no concern about how they will affect various parts of the 
organization. Sometimes, projects even work in conflict with each other. Too much 
focus has gone toward activities, programs, and projects and not enough attention 
has been given to outcomes, integration, success, and ultimate accountability.
The fourth major barrier is the lack of appropriate measurements. Executives 
who are concerned about the human capital investment do not have a clear under-
standing of what can be measured, what should be measured, and what is being 
measured. More important, they fail to recognize the connection between those 
measures and the success of the organization, or if a particular program or project 
is implemented to improve a particular measure, they do not know how to develop 
accountability around that project or program. A fully functioning human capital 
analytics team can help remove this barrier.
The fifth major barrier is a lack of effective and appropriate human capital 
strategy. A strategy provides direction, and the execution of the strategy drives the 
success of an organization. Human capital strategy has been reactive in its devel-
opment and largely ineffective in meeting the challenges of facing the current envi-
ronment. The relationship between the CEO and the chief human resources officer 
(CHRO) is not as effective as it needs to be. Most CEOs want CHROs to take a more 
strategic role and be proactive in their approach. The human capital strategy, when 
updated to reflect the current turbulent times and changing environment, can be 
the vehicle to build this productive relationship and drive the success that is needed.
Final Thoughts
The beginning point to understand the importance of human capital is to exam-
ine the history: how we got here. From all indications, human capital is extremely 
important to organizations and represents the last source of competitive edge. 
When managed properly, the results can be amazing. With the knowledge-­based 
and talent-­based economy continuing to dominate, human capital becomes even 
more critical. The problem is that it is often perceived as not being administered or 
managed properly in organizations. This book will provide the information neces-
sary to ensure that human capital is a strategic force in the organization, designed 
to deliver value and make a tremendous difference in its success.

T
he first step in examining the ability of the CHRO to create value for an organi-
zation is to revisit the strategy. This chapter explores a variety of issues involved 
in linking human resources to the strategy of the organization and includes cur-
rent trends, processes, and successes. The focus throughout this chapter is how to 
develop a human capital strategy to create value, drive results for the organization, 
and prepare for the forces influencing organizations.
The Importance of Linking  
Human Resources to Strategy
Connecting HR to strategy has been a developing trend for many years. Human 
resources was originally initiated in organizations because business strategy deter-
mined that HR was necessary. The level of CHRO participation in the corporate 
strategic planning process has been increasing, and there is evidence to suggest that 
the CHRO’s role as strategic planner will be increasingly important in the years to 
come.1 This conclusion is based on how CHROs respond to five basic questions that 
surround the strategic planning process:
	 1.	 What is our business?
	 2.	 What will our business be?
	 3.	 What should our business be?
	 4.	 What forces will influence our success?
	 5.	 How will we address these forces?
Human resources is an important part of framing the appropriate responses to 
these questions. The CHRO, as part of top management’s strategic planning effort, 
can provide the knowledge and vision necessary to make decisions and take action 
that will provide employees the opportunity to achieve success.
HR is being completely transformed in many organizations. The result is the 
creation of strategic, value-­added, critical business processes within the organi-
zation. To achieve value, the human capital function is creating business results, 
assisting in strategy implementation, and helping in strategy formulation.

Influences
Although the connection of human resources to strategy seems to be a logical, ratio-
nal evolution of the field, several important influences emerge. For HR to become 
more effective and produce the desired results, it must be closely linked to the stra-
tegic objectives of the organization. Otherwise, it may not add the appropriate value 
and move the organization in the desired direction. Thus providing the right oppor-
tunities at the right time for the right individuals to generate the desired results 
requires a close alignment with strategic business objectives.
At the heart of any strategic direction of an organization is change and change 
management. Change is the only constant in most organizations, and human 
resources is often seen as the driver for the change process. This requires the HR 
function to be more closely aligned with strategy as the CHRO organizes, coordi-
nates, implements, evaluates, and leads organizational change.
Recent interest in accountability for human resources has brought more atten-
tion to the strategic connection. As senior executives and internal clients demand a 
measurable value, the HR function must initiate and design programs with specific 
business objectives. These objectives are derived from an analysis of the business 
needs of the organization, which are usually defined by the strategic direction. Thus 
the requirement to produce business results from HR is driven by business objec-
tives, which come from business needs, which are connected to strategy. This chain 
of events links human resources to the key strategic objectives of the organization.
As the human resources function becomes more sophisticated, CHROs are plan-
ning strategically. HR functions have mission statements, vision statements, and 
their own strategic plans, which must support the strategic plan of the organization. 
Thus as the HR function plans strategically, it becomes more closely aligned with 
the organization’s overall strategy.
Top executives recognize the importance of HR and the necessity to use it in a 
strategic role. In some situations, top executives are applying top-­down pressure to 
link human resources to strategic direction. For example, some organizations have 
developed a strategy to transform customer service into a strategic and competitive 
weapon. HR programs are one of the most effective processes to achieve excellent 
customer service. Consequently, HR is an important tool to fulfill a major strategic 
objective.
Finally, with increased concern about intellectual capital, knowledge-­based 
organizations, and human capital development, some top executives are realiz-
ing that to sustain their competitive advantage, they must acquire, develop, and 
retain effective human capital. To do so, the CHRO must connect human resources 
directly to the strategic direction of the organization.
Overall, these major influences have placed considerable pressure on organiza-
tions to connect HR more closely with strategy. The evidence is impressive, and the 
progress has been significant. However, there are still more advances to be made as 
more organizations attempt to make this dramatic shift.
Human Capital Is Critical
Perhaps no influence in the evolution of organizations and human resources and 
its connection to strategy is more pronounced than the growth of human capital. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN CAPITAL STRATEGY
15
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Some argue that human capital is just another label for the traditional personnel 
function, just renaming the process to enhance its image. Others argue that human 
capital is much different—­designed to imply more of a strategic approach than 
traditional “personnel.”
The importance of human capital rests with four major issues:
	 1.	 In most, if not all organizations, the cost of employees is the largest single 
line-­item expense. This tremendous cost brings human capital into the focus 
of executives with two concerns. They want to control the costs, but at the same 
time, they want to see it as an investment that can reap many returns in the 
future.
	 2.	 Human capital is the last source of competitive advantage. All organizations 
have relatively the same access to raw materials, financial resources, and tech-
nology. The key differentiator to developing a competitive organization is the 
human capital, and just like tangible assets from an accounting perspective, 
which are often called capital assets, the humans in the organization are con-
sidered to be important capital. Thus human capital becomes the number-­one 
asset.
	 3.	 Human capital is the number-­one differentiator in the success of organiza-
tions. The most admired companies, the most innovative organizations, the 
best places to work, and the most successful businesses all attribute their suc-
cess to how their employees are engaged and drive value for the organization.
	 4.	 How human capital is actually employed, just like the employment of finan-
cial capital, is the critical issue. In some organizations, the employment of 
human capital is not very successful, and in others, it is highly successful. The 
challenge is to make sure that human capital is addressed from the acquisition 
phase all the way through to optimization.
The clear-­cut differences between traditional HR and the human capital 
approach were presented in Chapter 1, as Table 1.2.
Strategic Roles
The CHRO is poised to assume several roles in developing and supporting organi-
zational strategy. In some organizations, only one or two roles are developed, while 
in world-­class HR teams, as many as five roles are defined to build a strong linkage 
with strategy.
The first important role for the CHRO is to develop a strategic plan for human 
resources. This brings strategy to the HR functional level. Beginning with a mission 
statement or business objective, this plan contains specific strategies that the learn-
ing and development staff members can understand and implement while staying 
connected to the organization. A major part of this book focuses on this effort.
In another role, the CHRO is often involved in developing the strategic plan for 
the organization. In this role, the CHRO has a “seat at the table” where strategy is 
developed and provides important input, raises critical issues, voices necessary con-
cerns, and offers suggestions and solutions to shape the direction of the HR func-
tion. This is another critical role of human resources in its linkage to strategy. The 

16	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
material in this book helps ensure that the forces external to the organization that 
influence the availability and success of human capital are appropriately addressed 
in the organization’s strategic plan.
A third role is in implementation. As different parts of the organization imple-
ment strategic plans, the CHRO is often involved in the implementation with spe-
cific programs, services, and processes. Almost every strategy implementation will 
include the need for HR programs and services, because people are essential to 
achieving the strategic objectives. When HR programs and services are success-
ful, business results are produced—­usually linked to strategic objectives. Thus the 
human resources function is operating strategically, as it drives the important oper-
ating and business performance measures.
A final role assumed by some HR functions is to teach the strategic planning 
and implementation process to others in the organization. A successful organi-
zation requires an adequate level of knowledge and skills with strategic planning 
and implementation processes. Every employee should understand some level of 
the processes, requirements, tasks, and outcomes of strategic planning. Through 
consulting services, rewards systems, and learning programs, the HR function can 
build the appropriate expertise.
Several operational frameworks are used to develop a strategic role for the 
human resources organization. A strategic role requires a major shift for HR with 
more focus on purpose and direction. As depicted in Figure 2.1, the early focus of 
the HR department was on products or programs. The HR staff developed as many 
products as possible. There was little concern about whether the programs were 
needed or actually worked. The goal was to have as many products as possible, used 
by as many groups and individuals as possible.
The shift to a service-­focused HR function was an improvement, where the focus 
was on ensuring that products and services met the actual needs of the organization. 
The client concept entered the process, and customer service became extremely 
important. With various customers identified, the staff focused on ensuring that 
customers were pleased with the products and services delivered, usually through 
client surveys.
The HR function is now strategically focused, implementing products and 
services and meeting organizational needs that are linked to strategic objectives. 
The focus goes beyond client satisfaction, ensuring that the products and ser-
vices are closely linked to important strategies in the organization and achieving 
desired results. This mindset helps ensure that the HR function is adding value 
to the organization and becoming an important business partner with the man-
agement team.

THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN CAPITAL STRATEGY

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Strategic Planning Process
Strategy is about value. According to strategy expert Ken Favaro, strategy boils down 
to three fundamental questions: First, how can you differentiate yourself from the 
competition in the way you create value? Second, what capabilities do you have that 
are distinct from those of your rivals and essential to your particular way of creating 
value? Third, what businesses should you be in, and what products and services 
should you offer, given your chosen approach to creating value and your particular 
set of distinctive capabilities?2
Most organizations fail to fully answer these questions—­particularly in a fash-
ion that views them as an integral whole. This leaves leaders without guideposts to 
navigate the most pivotal challenges of top management, including transformation, 
change, agility, and invention. As a result, instead of growth and innovation, there 
is only incoherence and inefficiency.
Several models are available that reflect the varied stages, processes, and steps of 
developing a strategic plan and process for the organization. From the perspective 
of creating value, the model shown in Figure 2.2 is the most useful and practical 
model. A few select parts of the model are described here.
Develop a Vision for Value
An important part of developing the strategic direction of the HR function is to 
develop an appropriate vision that reflects strategy and other shifts in the human 
resources function. At times, the vision starts with the value the organization places 
on its people. Although top executives claim that people are the most important 
issue, sometimes it needs to be more specific.
For example, at SABMiller, one of the world’s largest brewing companies with 
operations in more than forty countries and beer brands in the world’s top fifty 
(more than any other brewery), the efforts of the training institute are reflected in 
its initial value. According to the company, “Unquestionably, SABMiller believes in 
the value of people as a core element of business success. Today, SABMiller com-
petes successfully in the global beer industry and is proud to acknowledge that one 
of our key points of differentiation is our Human Resource Proposition. Whilst

virtually all our competitors leverage a brand-­led or capital resource-­led expansion 
strategy, our international expansion has been led by our people proposition. This 
proposition has established our reputation for attracting the most talented individ-
uals.” They go on to indicate that “a corporate university allows not only world-­class 
skills development, but an opportunity to instill in employees the corporate culture, 
corporate ethics and the soul of the company. Leadership by examples is SAB’s 
corporate brand essence and this is woven into the culture the corporate university 
imparts to all delegates.”3
The following vision comes from a large healthcare chain and reflects HR’s con-
nection to strategy as the organization shifts from the traditional HR function to a 
human resources performance-consulting role.
We will exceed the expectations of our business partners by providing world 
class HR performance and development processes, expertise, and tools driv-
ing superior performance. We will achieve this vision by:
•	 Attracting and selecting the most capable and diverse employees
•	 Consulting with our business partners to assess performance gaps, rec-
ommend improvement strategies, and shepherd ongoing performance 
improvement
•	 Designing, developing, and delivering performance improvement pro-
grams for work processes and employees
•	 Evaluating the impact of HR programs focused on the organization’s 
strategic imperatives of achieving superior customer satisfaction, domi-
nating market share, maximizing profitability, and promoting a culture 
of winning with highly motivated, well-­informed, diverse associates
Establish Mission/Purpose
The next step of the model is to develop the specific mission or purpose for the orga-
nization, whether it is a learning and development position in a major department, 
division, unit, subsidiary, or the entire company. The mission statement describes 
why HR exists. It is usually simple, sometimes one sentence, and it serves as the 
reason for being.
Sometimes the mission statement is quite simple and very specific. As men-
tioned in Chapter 1, QUALCOMM is a leading developer in supplying digital wire-
less communication products and services and is the innovator of code division 
multiple access (CDMA), a technology that has become the world standard for 
the wireless communications industry. It is truly one of the most successful tele-
communication and technology companies today. QUALCOMM’s human resources 
mission statement is “We are committed to optimize employee performance and 
engagement providing HR opportunities linking overall business goals and profes-
sional development needs.”
Part of the mission is defining the overall purpose of the HR function. The 
human resources function has been shifting from an activity-­based process to a 
results-­based process. This is a slow transition for some and a much quicker one 
for others. An HR function focusing on results with a desire to create value for the 
organization will quickly move to a results-­based process. Figure 2.3 shows the shift

that has been occurring for some time. The focus on results is about more than 
just measuring success; it is creating value throughout the process from beginning 
to end. Programs and solutions are developed with the end in mind, described by 
very specific business needs. Performance issues and objectives are developed for 
application and business impact. Results and expectations are communicated to a 
variety of audiences, with the focus on learners. An environment is prepared to 
support the implementation. Partnerships are developed with all key managers and 
clients, and metrics are utilized, including a healthy dose of return on investment 
(ROI). More important, the planning and reporting is based on output, not input, 
as measured by number of programs, projects, involvement, costs, and processes. 
This, in essence, is the focus of much of this book: to show organizations how the 
CHRO is adding value along all these dimensions—­and others—­as the shift to value 
is occurring.
Define the Audiences for Best Results
In many organizations, the “clients” of the HR function are predetermined by exec-
utives and may not be adjusted easily; the audience is usually all employees. How-
ever, sometimes there is some flexibility. In most organizations, there are a variety 
of audiences that can be served by HR. Figure 2.4 shows the variety of audiences in 
a typical multiple-­purpose organization.
Although human resources may be part of a division or subsidiary or even a 
business unit within a major organization, the same issues may be developed. The 
employees (or employee groups served) are at the core of any HR function. This key

target group has several subdivisions, ranging from professional staff, to sales staff, 
to manufacturing, to technical support, to research and development, and many 
others. Human resources should focus on all employee groups and levels, as this is 
the fundamental target for creating results.
The next logical progression is those groups closely aligned to the employee net-
work. These are the franchise owners or resellers—­individuals who are charged with 
selling the product or services. This is an excellent audience for leveraging results. 
Most HR program opportunities will focus on value-­adding processes that are easily 
measured and should translate into sales growth and market share enhancement. 
A notable example of franchisee training is Subway Restaurants. The company pro-
vides HR advice and support to franchisees to recruit, select, train, compensate, 
engage, retain, and discharge employees. This provides a tremendous opportunity 
for improving sales, increasing profits, decreasing customer complaints, and pre-
venting excessive employee turnover.
The next logical audience is partners or allies. These groups or organizations 
may represent joint ventures, alliances, or partnerships, both formal and informal. 
From the HR perspective, there is value in helping partners recruit, select, and 
develop skills and capabilities, although the payoff may not be as direct as with 
employees, franchisees, and resellers.
Another prospective audience is made up of suppliers and vendors. For some, it 
may seem unusual for a supplier or vendor network to participate in diversity and 
affirmative action programs. However, because of the need to have consistency in 
processes and focus on quality and standardization, some organizations provide 
learning opportunities for the supplier network. For example, many HR functions

provide a variety of training and development programs for their suppliers and 
require them to meet compliance standards.
Another interesting audience group is the company’s actual customer base. 
While not appropriate for every organization, some HR functions provide learning 
and development opportunities for their customers with the goal of enhancing the 
use and implementation of their products and services. For example, the learning 
center at Home Depot provides customer clinics, demonstrating how to use tools 
and processes to successfully complete home improvement projects. Microsoft 
Learning, through a variety of learning centers, provides all types of training and 
certification on the proper use of Microsoft products. Verizon Communications 
provides a similar service.
A final target audience is the public; companies target this audience by offer-
ing a variety of programs and opportunities for anyone interested in improving 
performance. These are usually developed after an HR function has established 
a reputation for being very successful in communicating innovative approaches 
and ideas. Several notable organizations have developed these types of programs. 
DuPont developed a tremendous reputation for safety and ultimately sold this ser-
vice to an external, public company. Walt Disney designed the Disney Institute to 
provide customer service programs to a variety of organizations. These programs 
represent a great opportunity to generate results, as these HR programs are usually 
operated at profit centers, sometimes driving a significant amount of revenue for 
the organization while enhancing corporate image.
If there is flexibility, audiences should be selected for maximum results. 
Some audiences, such as those dealing directly with customers, the public, fran-
chisees, and employees, represent some of the best opportunities for driving 
results. Usually those connected closely to the customer provide the best oppor-
tunities for adding value.
Organize for Results
When focusing on results, organizational structures are very important for the 
CHRO. Structure can sometimes make the difference between an inefficient, 
bureaucratic, and unresponsive learning center and an efficient, productive, and 
effective process. The first issue involves the actual reporting relationship of the 
CHRO. Figure 2.5 shows the potential reporting relationships. Where the CHRO 
is positioned in the organization often reflects the senior executives’ view of HR. 
Ideally, the CHRO should report directly to the CEO, and this is common in some 
organizations. This placement ensures the proper support and direction from top 
management and sends a strong message throughout the organization that HR is 
important. However, in large organizations with many issues, functions, and prior-
ities, the CHRO may report to other executives. A second choice is reporting to the 
chief operating officer (COO) or the equivalent role. Because HR mainly supports 
the operations of the organization, this provides a direct link to the leader of that 
function. A growing trend is for CHROs to report directly to operating units to 
ensure support, commitment, and direction from the customers that are most often 
served. One disadvantage to this is that service to nonoperating units may suffer 
on the priority list. Another disadvantage is the lack of corporate oversight of the 
function and alignment with the CEO and his or her direct staff.

22	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
A trend that has been developing in recent years is to have the CHRO report 
directly to the CFO. According to Gartner Research, the prevalence of this practice 
is growing, though slowly, and this is surprising to some HR observers. Gartner 
explains it this way: The human resources function manages the human capital 
strategy of the organization. The largest single expense is human capital. Previ-
ously, the HR function had not done a very good job of showing the value. Placing 
it under the chief financial officer brings two important influences: First, there is 
help with measurement in terms of showing the value of human capital. Second, 
there is emphasis on controlling the costs. The CFO philosophy is that if you cannot 
show the value, then focus on controlling the costs. Although this is a frightening 
scenario for many HR executives, it actually has very positive outcomes. Most CFOs 
go into this new responsibility with a very helpful spirit. They want to help the HR 
team show the value, improve efficiency, and save costs. This is sometimes the kind 
of support CHROs need as they struggle to get budgets approved and show the 
impact and ROI of human capital programs.
When organizing for results, the next issue is the actual structure of the 
HR organization. While there can be many different structures, four basic 
approaches are utilized. Most organizations will either follow these approaches 
or have a blend of the four. Figure 2.6 shows the approaches, ranging from func-
tional to regional.
A functional approach structures HR into functional units, such as recruiting, 
selection, learning, and compensation. A structure based on programs builds on 
the specialties within human resources, such as analytics, design and development, 
delivery and implementation, and consulting and advice.
The business unit approach ensures that the learning organization is aligned 
with the business units and providing staffing support. A variation of this would be 
to have support for the different functional units for manufacturing, sales, finance, 
research and development, and so on.
The regional approach is to break the organization down into different regions 
and provide HR support to each particular geographic area. A broader version of 
this, the global approach, has the learning manager for each country reporting to 
the CHRO.

Whatever the approach taken, the following recommendations must be consid-
ered when selecting the proper organizational structure:
	 1.	 Position the HR function as close as possible to where HR takes place.
	 2.	 Ensure that the HR function is as responsive as possible to changing business 
needs.
	 3.	 Avoid overlap and duplication across the organization.
	 4.	 Build the functional expertise within the HR organization so that its staff are 
expert providers of services.
These factors affect not only responsiveness and efficiency but the overall effec-
tiveness and value added to the organization.

Human Capital Strategy
With the process model in place, a functional, flexible, and adjustable human cap-
ital strategy must be developed. It is helpful to examine the typical human capital 
strategy and then update that strategy to address the forces that are influencing 
organizations today.
Typical Human Capital Strategy
Figure 2.7 shows what most would consider a typical human capital strategy. This 
is arranged in a sequential format of how talent is cycled through an organization.
•	 Attract, recruit, and select talent that best fits the organization in the most 
efficient way.
•	 Align talent with the organization and integrate them into the organization. 
This focuses on issues such as on-­boarding and socialization.
•	 Build capability within a team to perform and lead. For most operating 
employees, there is initial job-­related learning and professional development. 
For managers and executives, management and leadership development must 
be provided.
•	 Provide competitive salaries and benefits. Salaries are often a critical element 
of attracting and retaining employees and can also be motivational. Benefits 
also lead to improved job satisfaction and can be an attraction and retention 
issue.
•	 Motivate individuals to perform and excel in their jobs. This often involves 
rewards systems, job design, motivational programs, and engagement 
programs.
•	 Create effective employee relations and communications, recognizing that 
great teamwork and communication in an organization are critical. Having an 
effective employee-­relations climate keeps complaints, charges, and challenges 
to a minimum.
•	 Retain critical talent. Although most types of talent need to be retained, the 
particular focus is on those jobs or job groups that are considered to be critical 
to the organization’s success.
This range of progressive steps is very typical and necessary in organizations.

THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN CAPITAL STRATEGY
25
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Human Capital Strategy Reflecting Today’s Climate
Figure 2.8 shows the updated version of the human capital strategy, where the 
twelve forces explained in this book have a significant impact on the organization. 
These forces must be addressed in the human capital strategy in specific statements 
as well as in policy, provisions, and actions taken:
	 1.	 Investment. This is critical for any function but particularly human resources. 
The organization must determine the optimum level of money to spend on 
human capital. This force is covered in Chapter 3.
	 2.	 Business alignment. It is essential that almost every program (particularly those 
representing major expenditures) and major effort be connected directly to the 
business. This force is covered in Chapter 4.
	 3.	 Talent management. In any part of the organization, there is a talent issue, but 
it is particularly important with human resources, as the HR function will affect 
talent decisions and processes throughout the organization. Consequently, this 
has tremendous impact on organizational performance. This force is covered 
in Chapter 5.
	 4.	 Employee engagement. Organizations must reexamine the nature of work in 
terms of not how and when but where it is actually performed, as employees 
have to be engaged to reach maximum productivity, quality, and efficiency 
goals. Engagement is also an important determinate of talent retention. This 
force is covered in Chapter 6.
	 5.	 Performance and innovation. An organization must develop a performance cul-
ture so that it can drive the success that is needed by the various stakeholders. 
At the same time, to thrive and grow, it must address innovation and constantly 
reinvent itself to be able to sustain outstanding performance for long periods 
of time. This force is covered in Chapter 7.
	 6.	 Employee health. The cost of healthcare has skyrocketed in most countries, 
especially the United States of America, to the point where it has become a 
critical issue for not only individuals and the government but employers as 
well. This is particularly important if employers are providing healthcare costs. 
However, the health of employees has an effect on the organization apart from 
the actual healthcare costs. This involves issues such as wellness programs, 
fitness programs, and a variety of health initiatives that try to keep employees 
healthy to maintain costs and reach optimum levels of productivity, quality, 
and efficiency while minimizing mistakes, accidents, and incidents. This force 
is covered in Chapter 8.
	 7.	 Demographics and societal changes. The demographics of the workforce are 
changing rapidly. Today, four generations may work together in the same orga-
nization. Women are steadily increasing their penetration into critical job 
groups, including leadership positions. The immigrant profile of companies is 
also rapidly changing. These demographic shifts can have a profound effect on 
the success of an organization. Chapter 9 discusses this force.
	 8.	 Technology. Technology has both a positive side and a negative side. On the one 
hand, it enhances communication, increases productivity, and makes organiza-
tions extremely profitable. On the other, it can leave an organization vulnerable 

26	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
to employee distraction, cyberattacks, and lack of focus. This force is covered 
in Chapter 10.
	 9.	 Globalization. Whether employees know it or not, globalization radically affects 
their jobs, sometimes their pay, and even the future of their organizations. All 
organizations must take steps to minimize its negative effects and optimize its 
positive effects. This force is covered in Chapter 11.
	10.	 Environmentalism. This is a critical issue throughout the globe. Employees are 
in the best position to make important changes in their habits that can have 
a profound effect on the environment. Human capital strategy must directly 
address this issue, maybe even driving the sustainability efforts in an organiza-
tion. At the same time, the strategy must prepare employees for the problems 
that will occur because of the deterioration of the environment. This force is 
covered in Chapter 12.
	 11.	 Global leadership. Organizations are spending more on global leadership 
than ever before. Effective leaders are needed in all types of organizations, 
and the success of organizations rests on the quality of their future leaders. 
This force is covered in Chapter 13.
	12.	 Analytics and big data. The last decade has brought changes in the way the 
human resources function analyzes and uses data to make improvements. The 
opportunities are far-­reaching for human capital analytics teams, who must 
ensure that big data is driving the value that is needed. This force is covered in 
Chapter 14.
Together, the typical human capital strategy and these forces make an updated 
strategy. Figure 2.8 depicts the recommended strategy that is the basis of this book. 
The strategy is implemented through the process model described earlier in this 
chapter.
Top executives and CEOs of major organizations want this change in strategy. 
Ben Verwaayen, chief executive officer of British Telcom, made a speech in autumn 
2014 for an audience of 350 HR professionals in the Netherlands. The key message 
he gave was very clear: HR leaders will have to leave their comfort zone and step 
up their efforts if they want to make a significant business contribution. Instead of 
accommodating current strategies, HR should play a proactive role when it comes 
to strategic changes and talent development.
When asked what CEOs do to provide the space to make HR an integrated 
part of the overall business strategy, he stated that CEOs do too little. They do 
not give these topics sufficient thought. They may find it scary to explore new 
approaches. HR does not challenge CEOs enough in this respect; they leave their 
bosses too much in the comfort zone.4 In a study from the Economist Intelli-
gence Unit involving more than 130 CEOs, the need for HR executives to be more 
involved in strategy was clear. When asked “How involved is the head of HR 
is strategic planning?” 55 percent said they were a key player. When asked “How 
involved should they be?” 70 percent wanted them to be a key player.5 Ram Charon, 
trusted CEO advisor, weighed in on this issue: “I talk with CEOs across the globe 
who are disappointed in their HR people. They would like to be able to use their 
chief human resource officers (CHROs) the way they use their CFOs—­as sounding 
boards and trusted partners—­and rely on their skills in linking people and numbers

to diagnose weaknesses and strengths in the organization, find the right fit between 
employees and jobs, and advise on the talent implications of the company’s strategy. 
But it’s a rare CHRO who can serve in such an active role.”6
Final Thoughts
This chapter has explored the very beginning of the formal human resources process 
linking HR to strategy. Although all organizations have an ongoing HR function, 
it may be helpful to review the current approach to human capital and assess the 
degree to which HR is connected to strategy. A variety of issues and approaches were 
described, all focusing on how the CHRO can create value for the organization. This 
focus on accountability, results, and creating value is critical to the success of the 
HR function. A typical human capital model was presented along with an updated 
version that focuses on twelve of today’s major forces that affect organizations. The 
remainder of the chapters are devoted to these twelve forces.

O
ne of the most critical strategic issues facing the CHRO is determining the 
appropriate investment level for human resources. How much you should 
spend on your employees is a fundamental issue, yet in practice, it doesn’t receive 
enough attention. While some CHROs use benchmarking only—­and maybe to a 
fault—­other strategies may be appropriate. This chapter details five specific strate-
gies for determining the investment level:
	 1.	 Let others do it. (Avoid the investment altogether.)
	 2.	 Invest the minimum. (Invest only what is absolutely necessary.)
	 3.	 Invest with the rest. (Use benchmarking to guide the appropriate investment.)
	 4.	 Invest until it hurts. (Spend too much on human resources either intentionally 
or unintentionally.)
	 5.	 Invest as long as there is a payoff. (Use a measurement system to understand 
the value of human capital compared with the investment.)
The majority, if not all, of organizations utilize one or more of these strategies. 
This chapter provides examples and information to help guide CHROs to determine 
which strategy will best fit their situation. Although the investment levels may be 
set initially, this is an issue that should be reviewed periodically.
Opening Stories
The retail industry, which represents one-­fifth of American workers, struggles with 
the issue of how much to invest in employees. Typically, they invest the minimum: 
Force 1: Investment. This is an issue with any function, but 
it is particularly important for the human resources function. 
Deciding approximately how much to spend on employees is a 
very strategic issue that deserves much attention. Spending too 
little or too much can be disastrous. Five options are possible 
for the investment level.

retail businesses set wages low and provide few benefits. Executives feel that they 
have no choice, because most of them compete on low prices. The assumption is 
that if they invest more in employees, customers will have to pay more, and they 
will lose business. These same executives conclude that employee-­friendly stores 
like Wegmans and The Container Store can offer more pay and benefits because 
customers are willing to pay higher prices. But this is not always the case. Recent 
research has shown that there is an alternative to low pay and few benefits. Here 
are three examples.1
Costco
Costco is a wholesale club with more than 663 stores and $110 billion in annual sales. 
Costco employees earn about 40 percent more than those of its largest competitor, 
Sam’s Club. Annual turnover is 5.5 percent for employees who stay with Costco for 
more than a year. The average for the industry is more than 50 percent.
While dead-­end jobs are the norm at most retailers, Costco provides advance-
ment opportunities. About 98 percent of store managers started in the stores. The 
University of Michigan’s American Customer Satisfaction Index ranks Costco as 
high as Nordstrom, a retail chain known for its outstanding service. Costco’s rating 
is consistently above Sam’s Club.
Costco is simplifying their operations. For example, Costco has only four thou-
sand SKUs (stock-­keeping units), compared to a supermarket average of thirty-­nine 
thousand. Costco also works hard to eliminate waste in their supply chain, such 
as by purchasing directly from manufacturers and moving goods to retail stores 
through their own efficient distribution process. The bottom line on these processes 
is that sales per employee per square foot at Costco is $986, about twice that of Sam’s 
Club at $588.
Trader Joe’s
Trader Joe’s is an American supermarket chain with 418 stores and $11.3 billion in 
annual sales. The starting wage for full-­time employees is $40,000 to $60,000 per 
year, more than twice what competitors offer. All store managers are promoted from 
within, and many executives started in the stores. Turnover of full-­time employees 
is less than 10 percent. Employees constantly engage customers in conversations 
and inform them about new products. They are known for suggesting products and 
recipes. Consumer Reports ranked Trader Joe’s the second best supermarket chain 
in the United States after Wegmans, which is also known for employee-­friendly 
practices and not very low prices. As with Costco, simplification is key.
Trader Joe’s has only about four thousand SKUs and therefore offers fewer 
choices within categories than their rivals do. With fewer products, employees 
can be familiar with everything the store sells and make more knowledgeable 
recommendations to customers. Many perishable products are sold already pack-
aged instead of loose, which speeds up checkout. Trader Joe’s purchases most 
products directly from manufacturers, and employees decide how many units of 
each item to order for their stores, with support from IT. The bottom line is that 
sales per labor hour are more than 40 percent higher than those of an average U.S. 
supermarket. Sales per square foot are more than three times those at an average 
supermarket.

Quiktrip
Quiktrip, a U.S. convenience store chain, has more than 600 stores and $11.45 billion 
in annual sales. The wages and benefits at Quiktrip are so good that the chain has 
been named one of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” every year since 
2003, including the most recent list in 2015.2 All store managers are promoted from 
within. Quiktrip’s 13.9 percent turnover rate among full-­time employees is substan-
tially lower than the 59 percent average rate in the top quartile of the convenience 
store industry. Customers get in and out of Quiktrip quickly because merchandise is 
always where it is supposed to be, and employees have been trained to ring up three 
customers per minute (often by not having to scan merchandise and by calculating 
change in their heads). Quiktrip only offers high-­demand products.
Part-­time employees receive 40 hours of training, and full-­time employees 
receive two weeks of training in all aspects of the job, including ordering mer-
chandise and sweeping floors. When customer traffic is high, employees focus on 
customer-­related tasks; when traffic is low, they focus on other tasks. Employees 
can move from one store to another. Employees have more predictable schedules 
and are more productive, and customers get faster service. World-­class manufac-
turing practices are applied to store operations. Every in-­store logistic process is 
timed and standardized. Employee feedback is incorporated into process design 
and improvement. Employees regularly discuss problems and opportunities. While 
most retailers operate with fewer employees, Quiktrip does the opposite and main-
tains a force of floaters who can fill in for employees who get sick, take vacations, 
or have an emergency. The bottom line is that Quiktrip sales per labor hour are 66 
percent higher than the average convenience store chain. Sales per square foot is 
$804 compared to $522 for the average convenience store chain.
These three examples show that retailers can avoid the tradeoff between low 
prices and investing in employees by implementing a set of operating practices 
that focus on simplifying processes, eliminating waste, cross training, enhancing 
jobs, and empowering employees. They can move beyond investing the minimum 
to investing when there is a payoff.
Let Others Do It
Some executives prefer to take a passive role when investing in employees, attempt-
ing to minimize the investment altogether. While somewhat dysfunctional, this 
approach has proven effective for some organizations, depending on their strate-
gic focus. This section explores the strategy of avoiding the investment in human 
resources in detail, the forces behind it, and the consequences—­both positive and 
negative—­of implementing it.
Basic Strategy
This strategy can be implemented using two different approaches. The first approach 
is to use contract and temporary employees in place of permanent employees. This 
arrangement allows the organization to add and remove employees with little or 
no commitment, thus reducing the expense connected to employee acquisition, 
training, development, and termination. The second approach is to outsource the 

32	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
job, often at lower cost. Taken to the extreme, employers can outsource most of 
the functions that would be performed by regular employees in the organization.
Several factors motivate executives to pursue one or both of these approaches:
•	 The total cost of employees. Some executives cannot—­or will not—­build the 
infrastructure to support human capital.
•	 The need to bring stability to the organization. Expansion and decline can be 
particularly challenging in cyclical or seasonal industries. Letting others make 
the investment in people enables businesses to balance employment levels, 
address particular needs, and control costs at the same time.
•	 The unavailability of expertise in the organization. It may not be practical to 
develop the experience needed, so executives will take advantage of external 
expertise.
•	 Survival. Some executives cannot afford to invest in human capital, at least not 
to the extent needed to build a successful team.
Employee acquisition and maintenance is expensive. Table 3.1 shows the pro-
cesses in which HR staff are involved. Because of the magnitude of these accu-
mulated expenses, executives avoid some costs by hiring contract employees. This 
avoids costs associated with payroll, benefits, and terminations, as well as some 
acquisition and training costs. Contract employees should be ready to make an 
immediate contribution. Executives also outsource major functions to lower the 
total cost of employees. Most outsourcing providers offer services at a lower cost; 
however, their cost premiums can sometimes outweigh the savings of outsourcing.
Employing Temporary and Contract Workers
Because of the high cost of attracting and retaining employees, particularly in cycli-
cal industries, some firms resort to employing contract workers. This is based on 
the belief that the nature of the employment cycle can create unnecessary expense 
when employees are being acquired and removed, creating turnover. Table 3.2 
shows all the cost categories related to turnover. In recent years, departing costs 
have become significant as employers spend large amounts on severance packages 
and services to enable employees to find other jobs. Some experts suggest that the

cost of turnover for critical talent is up to three times a person’s salary. Coupled with 
the high cost of attracting and developing employees, some organizations conclude 
that a highly capable contract employee is the best option, even for critical talent. 
For example, companies involved in exploration in the Alberta Oil Sands in Canada 
hire (and fire) contract workers as demand shifts, often driven by oil prices.
The alternative is to routinely reduce the number of employees, often through 
a “last-­in-­first-­out” process, which is frequently used by unionized organizations. 
This leaves the most senior and highest paid, but not necessarily the most pro-
ductive, employees on the payroll. Hiring temporary and contract workers avoids 
lowering regular employee morale by placing pay and jobs at risk.

Outsourcing
Recognizing the high cost of maintaining employees, particularly on a long-­term 
basis, some organizations have resorted to outsourcing to keep their employee head 
count to a minimum. For some companies, this is a strategy that enables a highly 
flexible, adaptive organization. Outsourcing can benefit an organization that is 
using external providers to deliver leading-­edge expertise. This approach essentially 
creates a small number of employees and a tremendous network of subcontractors 
who provide services that regular employees provide in other firms or that regular 
employees previously performed. Outsourcing usually costs less on a total basis and 
can bring in much-­needed expertise and specialization. Additional information on 
outsourcing is presented in the chapter on globalization (Chapter 11).
Invest the Minimum
While the previous section examined organizations that let others do the investing 
in people, this one examines those organizations that invest only the minimum. A 
few organizations adopt this strategy by choice; others do it out of economic neces-
sity. Either way, this is a viable option for some organizations. This section explores 
the issues involved in the strategy of minimum human capital investment and exam-
ines its challenges, consequences, and advantages. This strategy has several hidden 
land mines that can be detrimental in the long term if not recognized and addressed.
Basic Strategy
This strategy involves investing the very minimum in human resources, providing 
job training, salaries, benefits, and services only at the minimum level with almost 
no development and preparation for future jobs. Organizations adopting this phi-
losophy operate in a culture that is sometimes reflective of the competitive forces 
in the industry. These organizations experience high turnover and usually adjust 
processes and systems to take into account the constant churning of employees.
Though efficiency is gained by keeping costs at a minimum, this strategy should 
not be confused with efficient resource allocation. The strategy presented here is a 
deliberate effort to dispense only the minimum investment. This strategy is about 
facing the inevitable in some situations or making a deliberate attempt to invest as 
little as possible in employees.
Forces Driving the Strategy
The primary forces driving this strategy can be put into three words—­cost, cost, and 
cost. Some organizations work in such a low-­cost, low-­margin environment that a 
minimal human capital investment appears to be the only option. Low-­cost busi-
nesses, such as Wal-­Mart, operate on volume to make significant profits. Competi-
tion requires low wages and almost no benefits in many cases, and such conditions 
are inherent in some industries, such as retail or food service. However, the opening 
stories in this chapter illustrated that a low-­cost pressure doesn’t necessarily mean 
that investment in employees should be minimized.
Nevertheless, in some cases, the minimum investment strategy is adopted out of 
necessity—­the organization must invest as little as possible to survive, particularly in 

Set the Proper Investment Level

the short term. These organizations are often managed by executives who see little 
value in their employees and view them only as a necessary cost to deliver the service. 
They consider employees to be dispensable, easily recruited and quickly discharged if 
they are not performing appropriately. For example, as part of Radio Shack’s survival 
efforts, investment in employees went from low to even lower. But it didn’t work out. 
Radio Shack filed for bankruptcy in February 2015, after years of struggling to survive.3
The Cost of Turnover
Organizations investing only the minimum amount in human resources will have high 
turnover, and they usually do not understand the true cost of turnover. They see the 
direct cost of recruiting, selection, and initial training, but they do not take the time 
to understand the other impacts. Both the direct and indirect cost of turnover must be 
taken into consideration. The total cost of turnover is rarely calculated in organizations 
investing minimally in their human capital. When the cost is estimated, it is often 
underestimated. More important, estimations of the total cost are not communicated 
throughout the organization, leaving the management team unaware of the potential 
costs. Earlier, Table 3.2 listed the costs in the sequence in which they occur. This table 
suggested that there are many different costs, some of which are never known with 
certainty but can be estimated if enough attention is directed to the issue.
Table 3.3 shows the cost of turnover expressed as a percent of annual pay for 
selected job groups. As shown in this table, these costs, arranged in a hierarchy of 
jobs, are significant. The data for this table were obtained from a variety of research 
studies, journals, academic publications, industry publications, private databases, 
and professional associations, all from a database labeled ERIC (http://eric.ed.gov). 
Collectively, these external studies provide a basis for understanding the total cost 
of this important issue, and understanding the impact of turnover is the first step 
toward tackling it.
Table 3.3.  Turnover costs for selected job groups.
Job type/category
Turnover cost range (percentage 
of annual wage/salary)*
Entry-­level hourly, unskilled (e.g., fast food worker)
30–­50
Service/production hourly (e.g., courier)
40–­70
Skilled hourly (e.g., machinist)
75–­100
Clerical/administrative (e.g., scheduler)
50–­80
Professional (e.g., sales representative, nurse, accountant)
75–­125
Technical (e.g., computer technician)
100–­150
Engineers (e.g., chemical engineer)
200–­300
Specialists (e.g., computer software designer)
200–­400
Supervisors/team leaders (e.g., section supervisor)
100–­150
Middle managers (e.g., department manager)
125–­200
*Percentages are rounded to reflect the general range of costs from studies. Costs are fully loaded to 
include all the costs of hiring a replacement employee and bringing him or her to the level of produc-
tivity and efficiency of the former employee.

When the phrase fully loaded cost is used, it is important to consider what goes 
into it. The turnover costs in Table 3.3 contain both direct and indirect cost com-
ponents. A complete list of the cost components is included in Table 3.4. This table 
contains a list of cost items that can be derived directly from cost statements and 
others that have to be estimated. Essentially, those on the left side of the table can 
easily be derived, while those on the right side typically have to be estimated. When 
considered in total, excessive turnover is expensive and very disruptive.
Advantages and Disadvantages
There are many advantages to the minimum investment strategy. The first and most 
obvious is low labor costs. Executives taking this approach strive to be the lowest-­
cost provider of goods or services. In doing so, they must invest at minimum levels. 
Another advantage is that this strategy requires simplistic jobs, tasks, and processes. 
These job elements make recruiting, training, and compensation relatively easy. 
Finally, this may be the best strategy for survival, particularly on a short-­term basis. 
Depending on the nature of the business, some organizations must operate with 
minimum commitment to employees.
These advantages aside, investing the minimum in human capital can result in 
negative consequences for organizations. First, a minimum investment strategy must 
be considered only in the context of simple, lower-­level jobs. Automation is preferable 
if the jobs can be eliminated. If not, the jobs must be broken down into simple steps.
Second, organizations using this strategy must be able to cope with a high turn-
over rate. With little investment, employees will move on to another organization 
for just a slight increase in pay. Executives must ensure that hiring costs are min-
imal and initial training costs are extremely low. For example, McDonald’s keeps 
its jobs simple and the training very efficient, resulting in a low cost to recruit and 
build capability. With these costs at a minimum, McDonald’s executives expect high 
turnover and are willing to live with and adjust for it.
Third, this approach can have a long-­term negative impact as the turnover costs 
cause inefficiencies in the organization, deterioration in the quality of service, and 
an increase in indirect costs. This is not a major issue in a fast food chain where jobs 
can be divided into small parts and administered efficiently. However, for a man-
ufacturing or electric utility firm, it may be difficult to live with the high turnover

inherent in this strategy on a long-­term basis. CHROs in such companies usually 
seek to increase the investment in people. This is a difficult road, but with the 
right internal champions, changes can be made. Using benchmarks, demonstrating 
value-­added contributions, and aligning to business goals will assist in increas-
ing investment in human resources. For example, Wal-­Mart and McDonalds are 
now investing beyond the minimum. They are investing in upward mobility, career 
development, and management development. These organizations are proud of 
their store managers who started in entry-­level positions.
Invest with the Rest
Some organizations prefer to invest in human capital at the same level that others 
invest. Investing with the rest involves collecting data from a variety of comparable 
organizations, often perceived as implementing best practices, to determine the 
extent to which those organizations invest in human resources. The benchmark-
ing data are used to drive changes, if necessary, to achieve the benchmark level. 
In essence, this strategy aligns the organization to a level of investment that the 
benchmarked organizations achieve.
There has been phenomenal growth in benchmarking in the last two decades. 
Virtually every function in an organization has been involved in some type of bench-
marking to evaluate activities, practices, structure, and results. Because of its pop-
ularity and effectiveness, many CHROs use benchmarking to show the value of 
and ideal investment level for human capital. In many cases, the benchmarking 
process develops standards of excellence from “best practice” organizations. The 
cost of connecting to existing benchmarking projects is often very low, especially 
when the available data are considered. However, when a customized benchmark-
ing project is needed, the costs are significant. Organizations such as the Society 
for Human Resource Management (SHRM) have benchmarking services that use 
standardized measures for human resources practices and compare them by indus-
try, company size, and geographic location. Other helpful benchmarks come from 
Workforce Magazine, Strategic HR Review, Human Resource Management, Talent 
Management, and People & Strategy. These sources provide excellent opportunities 
to understand and validate investments in human capital.
An important force driving the invest-­with-­the-­rest strategy is that it is a safe 
approach. Benchmarking has been accepted as a standard management tool, often 
required and suggested by top executives. It is a low-­risk strategy. The decisions 
made as a result of benchmarking, when proven to be ineffective, can easily be 
blamed on faulty sources or processes, not the individuals who sought the data.
Benchmarking Basics
Benchmarking is a strategy that can be used in conjunction with other approaches. 
As a low-­cost approach, benchmarking can provide an important view of the human 
resources function and the investment required for it. Several issues must be addressed.
Human Capital Benchmark Measures
The first issue is to identify key HR drivers and performance indicators so that 
meaningful measures can be developed. Internal client feedback about existing 

38	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
processes and practices should be gathered so that critical success factors within 
the HR function can be prioritized and the appropriate focus for benchmarking 
can be selected.
For human capital investment, an important issue is determining specifically 
what should be benchmarked and what data are available. Ideally, a complete profile 
of cost data should be monitored to understand the total investment in human cap-
ital. Table 3.5 shows the human capital benchmarks needed to determine the appro-
priate investment levels. The definition of a particular measure must be addressed 
and clarified in benchmarking along with the many options, combinations, and 
possibilities available.
The first measurement group represents the expenses of the traditional HR func-
tion. This is often referred to as the HR department costs included in the overall HR 
budget. This measure shows the efficiency of the HR staff to deliver services. Present-
ing these expenses as a percentage of operating costs or revenue or on a per-­employee 
basis provides an easy comparison to other organizations in the same industry.
From the human capital perspective, the second grouping is more important. 
This represents the total investment in human capital, which is the total HR depart-
ment expenses plus salaries and benefits of all other employees. In essence, this 
group includes every function that exists in the chain of HR acquisition and main-
tenance. Attracting, selecting, developing, motivating, compensating, and main-
taining employees are accounted for in this total cost. Because the traditional HR 
department expenses do not include salaries of other functions, this measure has 
the effect of showing the total cost. It should be reported as a percent of operating 
costs or revenue or on a per-­employee basis to show realistic comparisons with other 
organizations. All the direct employee-­related costs are included in the human cap-
ital measure.
Human capital costs are sometimes associated with other functions that may 
not normally be captured in the HR budget. For example, finance and accounting 
may have transaction costs such as payroll; IT may be involved in the adminis-
trative issues of processing benefits claims or web-­based activities; security may 
be involved in some of the safety-­related issues; and property may be involved 
in providing facilities such as cafeterias and fitness centers. Identifying and cap-
turing all the costs are important to show the total human capital investment 
and make realistic comparisons. It should be noted that the cost of maintaining 
office space and equipment for employees is not included. This cost is usually 
reported as tangible assets or operating expenses. Employee travel falls in the 
same category.
The third grouping is by function, which is important to compare the efficiency 
of the various parts of the HR organization. HR expenses are those normally found 
in the HR budget, and the grouping is organized by traditional functions:
•	 Recruiting and selection
•	 Talent development (including orientation and socialization)
•	 Compensation, which includes direct compensation, bonuses, and deferred 
compensation
•	 Benefits, which includes all benefits and the costs to the company as well as 
external providers
•	 Employee relations, which includes labor relations for organized groups

or modified, it is helpful to understand the relative costs of the different steps to 
develop and implement them. Beginning with analysis and assessment, these cate-
gories include the typical program development phases and end with measurement, 
evaluation, and analytics. Reporting these as a percentage of the total cost of HR pro-
vides insight into the relative investment in these processes in similar organizations. 
In recent years, there has been growth in costs as a percent of total HR in the initial 
analysis and assessment to ensure that a new program or project is needed and that 
it is aligned with the business. The same is true in measurement, evaluation, and 
analytics because of the need to show the contribution of the HR program.
The fifth group shows some selected HR costs that need to be reported and 
perhaps compared with other organizations. They represent employee-­related cost 
variables and are measures that can be quite expensive and must be managed. Proac-
tively, these costs also represent values of important measures that can be improved 
with new or modified HR initiatives. These are invaluable data items when an orga-
nization attempts to calculate the ROI in human capital programs. Perhaps the 
most expensive measure in this group is the cost of involuntary employee turnover 
as described in this chapter. Accident and safety costs are important for manu-
facturing and construction industries. Healthcare costs are becoming increasingly 
critical for organizations providing healthcare for employees. Preventive programs 
are often put in place to eliminate these costs whenever possible.
The Elusive Best Practice
Inherently, the benchmarking process is designed to show what others accomplish 
or experience. The concept of the best practice is often an elusive goal because, 
in reality, many benchmarking projects involve participants that just happen to 
be in the same industry, in the same setting, or willing to participate in the study. 
They may or may not represent a best practice. Even determining the best practice 
can prove elusive. How is “best practice” defined? What is the basis of determining 
best practice? Who decides what is or is not best practice? How credible are the 
data reflecting the best practices? These are important questions to consider when 
observing and using benchmark data.
Best practice is even more elusive when the concept of human capital cost or 
investment enters into the equation. Is a best practice the lowest investment? Not 
necessarily, because there is a perceived linkage between investing in human capital 
and subsequent organizational success: the larger the investment, the more suc-
cessful the organization. In this case, the highest level of investment may be the 
appropriate choice to follow. But does a large investment in human capital infer best 
practice? Investment and cost must be explored from the perception of the outcomes 
and payoff. The investment in human capital should be examined in terms of its effi-
ciency. For example, how has an organization been able to accomplish an impressive 
target at a cost lower than others? The concept of best practice must be clearly under-
stood when benchmarking data are presented or when designing a custom process.
Benchmarking Sources
The sources for benchmarking involve two issues. The first challenge is to under-
stand the sources that currently exist for benchmarking studies. Here, the prin-
cipal organizations are needed for benchmarking studies involving credible data. 

Set the Proper Investment Level
41
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Table 3.6 shows some of the benchmarking sources that offer HR data across most 
of the United States as well as some international data. Although no one source 
provides all the data listed in Table 3.5, this list represents a cross-­section of orga-
nizations developing some type of human capital data. When data are not avail-
able, it is important to find a suitable source with which to partner to develop a 
custom-­designed benchmarking study. This issue is described in the next section.
For large organizations operating outside the local or regional area, it becomes 
more difficult to make comparisons—­not all areas are the same, and there are huge 
geographic differences in the quality and quantity of the talent in the labor markets 
from which organizations must select employees. Certain areas have more effective 
systems and facilities for developing capable, top-­quality employees.
Collecting national data presents a twofold dilemma. First, it is difficult to make 
comparisons because of geographic differences, unless the data are provided by 
region. (Consider, for example, the differences in human capital costs in New York 
City and Nashville, Tennessee.) The second issue is the limited sources available to 
provide credible data. It is even more difficult to benchmark at the international 
level. A replication process is necessary for benchmarking in each country. When 
there are differences in the practices of the countries, making comparisons to orga-
nizations located in another country becomes fruitless. If a particular employee 
benefit or HR program is implemented in one country, should it be included in 
other countries as well? These are dilemmas of operating globally, which make 
benchmarking data on a global basis unreliable. Still, attempts are made to bench-
mark each country through national surveys. A few of the organizations listed in 
Table 3.6 provide international data from the participating units in those countries.
Creating a Custom Benchmarking Project
Because of the concerns about the quality and availability of these data, some 
CHROs develop their own customized benchmarking for human capital measure-
ment. Although this appears unnecessary and is expensive, it may be the only way to 
match the organization’s interests and needs to comparable organizations. Inciden-
tally, if more organizations developed their own benchmarking studies, there would 
be more available data from the various partners. Figure 3.1 shows a seven-­phase 
benchmarking process that can be used to develop a custom-­designed benchmark-
ing project. Each phase is briefly described next.

Determining What to Benchmark
The first step is to identify precisely what type of information is needed from bench-
marking. This step deserves much attention because of the tendency to explore more 
areas than are feasible or necessary. Because of the time involved in securing the 
information, the problem with information availability, and the difficulty in finding 
suitable partners, benchmarking initiatives must remain within prescribed bound-
aries. Attempts to collect data that are generally unavailable or difficult to obtain 
are usually unsuccessful. Also, a lengthy request can be overwhelming, making it 
difficult to obtain information from a benchmarking partner. The items included 
in Table 3.5 detail the human capital investment categories. In addition to these, 
other non-­cost-­related measures may be sought. These include information such as 
absenteeism and turnover rates, time to fill jobs, hours of training per year, and so on.
Building the Benchmarking Team
This phase is designed to ensure that an effective internal benchmarking team is in 
place. An effective team makes the difference between success and failure; it should 
be carefully selected and prepared to achieve the desired response. Ideally, the team 
should include the HR executive, several HR specialists representing the different 
HR functional areas, and a few non-­HR managers and executives.
Although an individual could perform the tasks for the project, the team 
approach is recommended based on the volume of work alone. However, using a 
team approach also increases ownership of the process and enhances the credibility

of the final product. Indeed, the team approach helps ensure that benchmarking 
results are understood throughout the organization.
Identifying Benchmarking Partners
Identifying benchmarking partners for the project is one of the most important 
parts of the process. Data can only be useful if collected from respected organi-
zations. It is important to identify those organizations considered to follow best 
practices or be most successful according to some predetermined set of criteria. The 
targets may be competitors or noncompetitors in the same industry. Organizations 
in the same geographic area may be important because of concerns about local 
HR issues. Partnering with organizations sharing the same kind of structure (i.e., 
national, international, decentralized) may also be desirable. The best organization 
to benchmark against may actually be outside of the industry, and every attempt 
should be made to find partners who have an outstanding reputation in the area 
being benchmarked. It is important to think creatively.
A variety of sources can help categorize organizations and identify needed data. 
Table 3.7 shows some of the sources available for locating potential benchmarking 
partners. There are challenges: Some of the best organizations do not publish data 
about their successes, they are sometimes reluctant to make professional presenta-
tions, they may not apply for human capital awards, and they may not participate 
in an organization where the information is readily available. These limitations 
notwithstanding, it is possible to identify candidates that can make great bench-
marking partners.
Collecting Benchmarking Data
The first issue in this phase is to collect internal data. The data-­collection process, 
including the use of estimates, should be thoroughly tested within the organization 
to gain additional insight into the process. This provides a way to check the flow of 
data, quality of data collected, interpretation of data, and potential problem areas. 
If there are problems with internal information, other organizations will have prob-
lems delivering the data as well.

Next, the data are collected from the partners. Data-­collection arrangements 
should be negotiated in advance with organizations agreeing to participate. Typ-
ically, a detailed questionnaire is mailed and a telephone interview is conducted 
to explain all the questions, review the definitions, and address all concerns and 
issues. If feasible and appropriate, an on-­site visit is conducted to capture high-­
quality data.
Analyzing the Data
After data are collected, they must be tabulated, organized, analyzed, and inter-
preted. Data are typically organized in a spreadsheet that lists the organizations 
and the various headings for capturing the data. Spreadsheet analysis is appropriate 
for tabulating much data, which can be formatted for presentation at a later date.
Distributing Information to Benchmarking Partners
If it is not perceived as adding value within the sponsoring organizations, develop-
ing and distributing a report for all benchmarking partners can easily be omitted. 
However, if the benchmarking partnership is to be a positive, long-­term relation-
ship, information distribution must be handled with utmost care. Benchmarking 
partners require a report containing useful information that can be used internally 
to improve their processes. The quality of the report promised often creates the 
eagerness to become involved in the project. The contents of a typical benchmark-
ing report are as follows:
•	 An executive summary, which presents a brief conclusion from the survey data 
and provides a brief description of the overall process
•	 A statement of the purposes of the project with details on the objectives
•	 A listing of all participants
•	 A summary of benchmarked items
•	 A description of the methods for collecting and analyzing the data
•	 An outline of the overall results and conclusions that shows what the data may 
mean to the organization
•	 A description of the strengths within the group that attempts to determine best 
practices for each of the items benchmarked
•	 A request for this procedure to be a continuous process with potential future

The final, and probably most critical, phase in the benchmarking process is imple-
menting the improvements the process has shown as necessary. Until the improve-
ments are implemented, there is no return on the often extensive effort that goes 
into the benchmarking process. When implemented, the return can be great.
Initiating improvement involves three important issues: performance gaps, 
action plans, and an internal report.
	 1.	 Calculating the performance gap means looking at the difference between the 
desired (benchmarked) value and the current value. The difference translates 
into a gap that needs to be closed by improving a specific process.

	 2.	 Formulating the action plan involves selecting the appropriate actions to resolve 
the problem or improve the process and then detailing a series of steps that must 
be implemented over a predetermined period of time to complete these actions.
	 3.	 The final part of initiating improvement is writing a report for the internal cus-
tomers in the sponsoring organization—­the individual(s) for whom the process 
was initiated. This report shows the gaps found and the actions needed to close 
them. Updates of this report provide a view of the continued success being made.
Advantages and Disadvantages
The benchmarking process is not without its share of problems, consequences, and 
issues. Benchmarking must be approached as a learning process, not necessarily a 
process to duplicate or replicate accomplishments of others. Each organization is 
different. What is needed in one organization may not be the same in another. Also, 
benchmarking is time consuming when a custom-­designed benchmarking project 
is developed. It requires discipline to keep the project on schedule, within budget, 
and on track to drive continuous process improvement.
Determining what the best practices are is an elusive goal; benchmarking can 
create a misunderstanding that average data taken from a group willing to participate 
in a study represents best practices. Gathering national and international data is a 
difficult issue that often limits benchmarking as a global tool. Finally, benchmarking 
is not a quick fix; it is a long-­term improvement process. Table 3.8 shows some of the 
myths about benchmarking that cause the process to be misused or misunderstood.4
Benchmarking has many advantages, satisfies a variety of needs, and is used for 
several important purposes. It is extremely helpful in the strategic planning of the 
HR function and for determining the desired investment level. Information and 
measures derived from the process can enable HR executives to help the organiza-
tion meet its strategic objectives. It is also useful in identifying trends and critical 
issues for human capital management. Measures from benchmarking can become

the standard of excellence for an activity, function, system, practice, program, or 
specific initiative. It has become an important measurement and evaluation tool, as 
well as a routine management tool. Benchmarking also allows the organization to 
compare certain product features and benefits with others. To be successful, several 
qualities must be fostered when developing a custom project.
•	 A strong commitment to benchmarking from management
•	 A clear HR understanding of present practices as a basis for comparison to best 
practices
•	 A willingness to change HR practices based on benchmark findings
•	 A realization that competition is constantly changing and there is a need to stay 
ahead of the trend
•	 A willingness to share information with benchmark partners
•	 The involvement of a small number of organizations that are recognized lead-
ers in HR
•	 An adherence to the benchmarking phases
•	 A commitment to a continuous benchmarking effort for long-­term improvement
With this approach, executives use benchmarking to determine the desired level 
of investment in human capital and the mix of human resources programs and 
activities to pursue or improve. Benchmarking has been used routinely for more 
than two decades and is a mainstream management tool, used by many HR exec-
utives to set the human capital investment level. It can be used as the primary way 
to determine the human capital investment, or it can supplement other strategies.
Invest Until It Hurts
While some organizations invest at the same level as other organizations, many 
operate under the premise that more is better. They overinvest in human resources. 
The results of such an approach can be both disappointing and disastrous. A few 
CHROs do this intentionally; others do it unknowingly. Either way, this is a strategy 
that deserves serious attention. With this strategy, CHROs invest in programs and 
services beyond what is needed to meet the goals and mission of the organization. 
Executives implement almost every human resources program they see and teach 
every new idea that comes over the horizon.
Some advocates suggest that overinvesting in employees is not an important 
issue—­the more you invest, the more successful the organization. However, others 
will argue that overinvesting occurs regularly and is unnecessarily burdening orga-
nizations with excessive operating costs. Overinvesting puts pressure on others to 
follow suit, thus creating an artificial new benchmark. Investing until it hurts is 
not usually a deliberate strategy—­executives are simply unaware that the increase 
in spending is not adding value.
Signs of Overinvesting
An example of overinvesting is an automotive company located in North America. 
This firm, with headquarters outside the United States, spent almost $4 million 
on a wellness and fitness center for its North American employees. The rationale 

Set the Proper Investment Level
47
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
for investing in this center was to increase the attraction and retention of employ-
ees. The executives wanted to maintain high job-­satisfaction levels and thought 
that the wellness and fitness center would help accomplish this goal. In addition, 
they thought that a fitness center would be an excellent way to contain or lower 
healthcare costs. Some executives believed it would even reduce absenteeism and 
job-­related accidents.
When these measures were examined after the center opened, the results were 
far from what one would expect:
•	 Job satisfaction levels were extremely high—­beyond what was expected or per-
haps could even be achieved in most organizations.
•	 Attraction was not an issue. Just a rumor that there might be additional jobs on 
the assembly line would create an overwhelming amount of applications in the 
HR department. (At one time, as many as ten thousand people applied after an 
announcement that two hundred jobs would be added in the plant.)
•	 Retention was not an issue. The company was experiencing less than 3 per-
cent annual turnover—­too low by some standards. Unless there is significant 
growth, a turnover level that low is unhealthy. Lower turnover probably could 
not be achieved, even if a variety of solutions were implemented. Low turnover 
was a product of satisfied employees, a superior benefits package, and wages 
that were double the average in the area. If attraction and retention improve-
ment was the motive, the wellness and fitness center was a futile investment.
•	 Healthcare costs were below average for the manufacturing industry in the 
area. With the implementation of the wellness and fitness center, the costs 
were contained but not reduced; the cost differential was very small—­only 
enough to cover a fraction of the cost of maintaining the wellness and fitness 
center.
•	 The manufacturing facility enjoyed one of the best safety records in manufac-
turing. Because there was not an accident problem to begin with, there was no 
reduction in accidents since the center was developed.
•	 Absenteeism was not an issue and did not change significantly with the imple-
mentation of the wellness and fitness center.
Thus, from the return on investment prospective, the wellness and fitness center 
failed to add value. This is a classic case of overinvesting—­adding a benefit or service 
that does not add value to the organization yet adds significant costs.
A few years back, dot-­coms littered the landscape with examples of overin-
vesting, as company after company lavished their employees with benefits, perks, 
programs, and opportunities to buy their loyalty, motivate them to high levels of 
achievement, and retain them at all costs. One interesting organization investing 
heavily in human capital is SAS Institute, based in Cary, North Carolina. In less than 
four decades, SAS has evolved into a world leader in intelligence software services, 
with more than thirteen thousand employees, offices in three countries, and annual 
revenues of more than $3 billion. Jim Goodnight, the cofounder and CEO, has a 
reputation for showering his employees with perks. For example, employees work 
only thirty-­five hours per week. Sick days are unlimited and can be used for tending 
to ailing family members. Company specialists can arrange expert help for aging

parents. Benefits are extended to domestic partners. Employees at headquarters 
can take their preschool children to one of four daycare centers (two on-­site, two 
off-­site). Each of the twenty-­four buildings on this 250-­acre campus has a break 
room on every floor stocked with refreshments and snacks. Employees can choose 
between four cafes and work off their meals in a 54,000-­square-­foot gym, complete 
with free personal trainers, an Olympic-­size swimming pool, aerobics classes, and a 
dance studio. A soccer field, tennis courts, and a putting green round out the sports 
amenities.
Is all this necessary? Some would characterize this as going beyond what is 
needed to build a motivated, committed, and engaged workforce. Supporters sug-
gest that this is the primary reason for their low turnover of less than 3 percent; 
however, according to internal executives including the HR executive, no analyses 
have been conducted to connect these perks to a specific retention amount.
SAS routinely appears in Fortune magazine as one of the “100 Best Companies to 
Work For.” One publication characterized Goodnight as “extravagant.”5 In Fortune’s 
analysis, “This software maker is the closest thing to the worker’s Utopia in Amer-
ica,”6 highlighting the on-­site childcare, health center with physicians and dentists, 
massage therapists, hair salon, roof-­top garden, solar farm, and a profit-­sharing 
program as well. Goodnight credits the success of the company to the gung ho, 
dedicated workforce. Through a variety of perks and benefits, he attempts to make 
the employees’ lives easier and believes they will give their all to work. As a private 
organization, SAS is not subject to the scrutiny of Wall Street analysts. If that were 
the case, the employee benefit structure might be different.
Is investing in human capital to this extent a good thing? Some will argue that 
you cannot overinvest in human capital and that the more you provide employees, 
the better. Others would argue that each time a new program, project, or benefit 
is added—­particularly one that becomes a permanent fixture—­operating costs are 
added that will eventually place a burden on the company. At what point is there 
diminishing return on investing in human capital?
Forces Driving This Strategy
Several forces operate together to cause overinvesting. Some of these are realis-
tic challenges; others are mythical. During the 1990s, retention became the main 
battle cry. The labor market was tight, skilled employees were scarce, and orga-
nizations would do almost anything to keep employees or attract new ones. This 
often led to investing excessively in signing bonuses, expensive benefits packages, 
and a variety of perks, well beyond what would be necessary or acceptable in many 
situations. Offering all types of benefits and opportunities was designed to keep 
turnover low and was considered necessary for business survival. However, many 
organizations—­even industries—­were able to maintain low turnover without hav-
ing to resort to this strategy.
This placed a heavy burden on employers, which, at the time, seemed 
reasonable—­they could afford it. When economic climate changed and they could 
no longer afford it, executives had to remove these perks. The result was a disgrun-
tled workforce and increased turnover, the situation they were trying to avoid in 
the first place. This is a vicious cycle that can only be avoided by careful planning, 
with more focus on creating a workplace that is challenging and motivating, with

exciting opportunities, instead of a place where employees are pampered and paid 
excessively. Part of the problem is that many executives believe that retention is 
primarily related to pay, when it is not.
Investing until it hurts is not always a deliberate strategy. Executives may be 
unaware that the increase in spending is not adding value, as the automotive case 
study illustrates. In many cases, companies add benefits, services, and perks with-
out anticipating the full impact of these investments. The two most vulnerable 
areas are retirement plans and healthcare benefits. In the 1970s, some companies 
began to switch from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, shifting 
the investment risk to the employees. Many organizations still provide traditional 
defined benefit pension plans, however, which have proven to be extremely costly 
and difficult to change. Failure to make the switch has caused some firms to not 
only have excessive costs but even move into bankruptcy.
For the most part, executives did not anticipate the tremendous changes that 
lead to the burden of retirement. First, there is the investment risk of the pension 
plan. When you maintain defined benefit plans, it becomes more costly for employ-
ers than anticipated, particularly in a recession. Second, employees are living much 
longer, thus retirement costs are increasing. Third, employers are often much more 
generous because they think short-­term rather than long-­term as they provide ben-
efits and negotiate lucrative labor contracts.
These organizations are unwilling or unable to conduct the proper initial anal-
ysis to see if benefits are needed. Analysis will indicate if the benefits are the right 
solution to a particular problem. Without the analysis, programs are conducted 
when they are not needed, wasting money.
Finally, some organizations overinvest because they can afford to do so. 
They are very profitable, enjoying high margins and ample growth, and want to 
share the wealth with employees through benefits, perks, and bonuses. During 
the 1990s, many high-­tech companies made tremendous amounts of money. A 
number of them overinvested because they felt they could afford it. When the 
economy turned, the companies could not sustain some of these expenditures 
and benefits.
Concerns
Obviously, overinvesting is not a recommended strategy. There are many problems 
depicted in this section that are the byproducts of overinvesting, which can bur-
den not only the company but also the industry. The most significant disadvantage 
of overinvestment is the less-­than-­optimal financial performance. By definition, 
overinvesting is investing more than necessary to meet the objectives of the orga-
nization. The relationship between investing in human capital and financial per-
formance is depicted in Figure 3.2. As the figure shows, a certain level of investment 
yields additional financial results, but there is evidence of a point of diminishing 
return, where the added benefits peak and then drop as investments continue. As 
indicated, the “overinvesting” area reflects no increased financial performance for 
additional investments. Then there is a point reached where the actual performance 
goes down. This is excessive investing, which can eventually erode performance in 
the organization, particularly in industries where the human capital expense is an 
extraordinarily high percentage of the total operating cost. The knowledge industry 

50	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
is a good example, where the impact on the bottom line is severe when companies 
overinvest in human capital.
Invest as Long as There Is a Payoff
Some organizations prefer to invest in people when there is evidence that the 
investment is providing benefits. They often compare monetary benefits of 
learning programs with the costs of learning. This strategy is becoming more 
popular following the increased interest in accountability, particularly with the 
use of ROI as a business-­evaluation tool. With this strategy, all HR programs 
are evaluated, and a few key programs are evaluated at the ROI level—­that is, 
ROI is calculated the same way as it would be for an investment in buildings or 
equipment. The practices at Costco, Trader Joe’s, and Quiktrip, detailed in the 
opening stories of this chapter, are excellent examples of investing more because 
of the payoff results.
The ROI Strategy
This ROI strategy focuses on implementing a comprehensive measurement and 
evaluation process for expenditures in an organization. This involves the possibility 
of capturing up to seven types of data in the value chain, as shown in Figure 3.3.7 
Using this philosophy, only a small number of programs are examined in terms 
of ROI, whereas every program is evaluated with reaction data. When business 
impact and ROI are determined for a program, one or more techniques are utilized 
to isolate the impact of the program on the business data. Chapter 14 provides more 
detail on this approach to accountability.
Organizations adopting this strategy will evaluate each HR program at some 
level, following the value chain. Table 3.9 shows the percentage of HR programs

evaluated at each of the five levels of outcome each year for Scripps Health, a suc-
cessful not-­for-­profit healthcare organization with 13,000 employees.
Forces Driving Change
Although the trend toward additional accountability has been increasing over the 
last decade, there are several reasons this strategy is critical at this time. In the last 
few years, CHROs have had to demonstrate the value their programs add to their 
organizations. They have also had to develop the skill to communicate with other 
managers—­in the language of business—­the human resources contribution to the 
financial bottom line. In a world in which financial results are carefully measured, 
a failure to measure HR policy and practice implementation dooms this function to 
second-­class status, oversight, neglect, and potential failure. It has become appar-
ent that CHROs need to be able to evaluate—­in financial terms—­the costs and 
benefits of different strategies and individual practices.

The increasing cost of human resources is another driving force. As will be dis-
cussed throughout this book, investment in HR is quite large and growing. As bud-
gets continue to grow—­often outpacing other parts of the organization—­the costs 
alone are requiring some executives to question the value. Consequently, these 
executives are often requesting or suggesting that the impact of human resources 
programs be determined or forecast. In some cases, the ROI is required at budget-­
review time. Production managers, for example, propose investments in new tech-
nology and incorporate into their proposals the projected increases in productivity 
and resultant decreases in unit-­production cost. HR professionals must compete for 
scarce organizational resources in the same language as their colleagues and present 
credible information on the relative costs and benefits of interventions.
More CHROs are managing the human resources function as a business. These 
executives have operational experience and, in some cases, financial experience. 
They recognize that HR should add value to the organization, and consequently, 
these executives are implementing a variety of measurement tools, even in the hard-­
to-­measure areas. These tools have gradually become more quantitative and less 
qualitative. ROI is now being applied in human resources just as it is in technology, 
quality, and product development. A decade ago, it was rare to use ROI in this area. 
Now, business-­minded HR executives are attempting to show value in ways that 
top executives want to see. Top executives view human resources in a different way 
than they have in previous years and are no longer willing to accept HR programs, 
projects, and initiatives on faith. This is not to suggest that they do not have a com-
mitment to human resources, but now they see that measurement is possible—­and 
ROI is feasible—­and they want to see more value.
Advantages and Disadvantages
The ROI methodology has several important advantages. With it, the human 
resources staff and the client will know the specific contribution of a program in 
a language the client understands. Measuring ROI is one of the most convincing 
ways to earn the respect and support of the senior management team—­not only for 
a particular program but for the human resources function in general. The client 
who requests and authorizes a learning program or project will have a complete set 
of data to show the overall success of the process.
Because a variety of feedback data are collected during the program imple-
mentation, the comprehensive analysis provides data to drive changes in processes 
and make adjustments during implementation. Throughout the cycle of program

design, development, and implementation, the entire team of stakeholders focuses 
on results. If a program is not effective, and the results are not materializing, the ROI 
methodology will prompt modifications. On rare occasions, the program may have 
to be halted if it is not adding the appropriate value.
This methodology is not suitable for every program. It has some very important 
barriers to success. The ROI methodology adds additional costs and time to the 
HR budget, but not a significant amount—­probably no more than 3–­5 percent of 
the total direct human resources budget. The additional investment in ROI should 
be offset by the results achieved from implementation. However, this barrier often 
stops many ROI implementations early in the process. Many staff members may not 
have the basic skills necessary to apply the ROI methodology within their scope of 
responsibilities. The typical human resources program does not focus on results but 
on qualitative feedback data. It is necessary to shift HR policy and practice from an 
activity-­based approach to a results-­based approach. Some staff members do not 
pursue ROI because they perceive the methodology as producing results that reflect 
on their individual performance. If it is negative, they fear that their program may 
be cancelled. They fail to see ROI as a process-­improvement tool.
Human Capital Strategy Implications
This particular topic is rarely discussed in human capital strategy planning doc-
uments, yet as this chapter has detailed, without a clear-­cut strategy for human 
capital investment, the investment levels can be influenced by all types of assump-
tions, philosophies, and processes, some of them dysfunctional and not adding 
value. There is a tendency for organizations to use benchmarking as a way to set 
their investment level. There is also growing interest in investing as long as there 
is a positive payoff. This requires a comprehensive measurement system to show 
the value of human capital and the results. Specifically, the human capital strategy 
should address these three requirements:
•	 Define the way in which the investment levels are set for major job groups.
•	 If benchmarking is used, outline the strategy for benchmarking in terms of 
comparison groups or customized projects.
•	 Invest as long as there is a payoff, defining the particular way in which human 
capital is valued.

his chapter shows how to achieve business alignment by defining the need 
and the corresponding objectives for major programs. This step positions HR 
for success by aligning its intended outcome with the needs of the business. This 
alignment is essential if the investment in a project is to reap a return. The term 
business is used to reflect important outcome measures (e.g., output, quality, cost, 
time) that exist in any setting, including governments, nonprofits, and nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs).
Opening Story: Bridgeport Hospital
Bridgeport Hospital decided to implement an employer-­of-­choice program. By 
doing so, the hospital would be listed among the community’s preferred employ-
ers. The hospital would also be included in several national lists as an employer 
of choice.
In their analysis of the payoff of this proposed project, executives thought that 
if the project was successful, they would be able to sustain a positive work envi-
ronment by recruiting, developing, and retaining a diverse, high-­quality, engaged 
workforce. They needed to recruit and retain the best talent.
Next, the specific business needs were detailed. To achieve the designation of 
employer of choice, several specific measures had to be improved. The registered 
nurse (RN) turnover rate had to be less than 11 percent and the overall turnover rate 
less than 10 percent. The attrition rate among nursing students had to be less than 
Force 2: Business Alignment. Every organization must ensure 
that projects and programs align with business needs. Too 
often, all types of programs are implemented in an organization 
that are not aligned to specific business needs in the begin-
ning, during, or on follow-­up evaluations. With human capital 
programs, it is critical to have this alignment. The only way to 
demonstrate business value is to have this alignment.

19 percent, and positive employee relations had to be maintained, as evidenced by 
the employee satisfaction and employee engagement scores.
To meet these business needs, the performance needs were defined. The first 
requirement was adequate professional and support staff to care for the patients 
and ensure that the staffing levels remained sufficient. Second, employees needed 
to be more engaged for organizational performance to improve. This engagement 
would come through increased employee participation, feedback, communication, 
and collaboration with the management team. Third, management development 
was needed to enhance customer service and employee retention.
Next, the executive team identified the learning needs in each of these cat-
egories, detailing specifically what must be learned by stakeholders to meet the 
performance needs. The team concluded that significant learning was necessary 
for each participant group.
Finally, the entire workforce, particularly the management team, had to see the 
value and need for this program. The management team had to be convinced that 
the program was critical to sustaining a competitive healthcare organization. All 
employees needed to see the program as motivational, satisfying, and important 
to their own success.
Addressing these multiple levels of needs and developing objectives ensured 
that the project was absolutely necessary, positioned for success, and included the 
proper solutions.1
The Importance of Business Alignment
Let’s face it—­not all programs are connected to the business. As mentioned in Chap-
ter 1, the human resources function has a serious problem with showing the value of 
HR programs. New programs are implemented based on the assumption that they 
are needed and will probably drive value. This is essentially faith-­based program-
ming (“we have faith that this will work”). Unfortunately, many programs do not 
drive value, particularly those soft programs that are often initiated for the wrong 
reasons. The number-­one cause of program failure is lack of business alignment at 
the outset.2 New programs must begin with a clear focus on the desired outcomes. 
The end must be specified in terms of business measures so that the outcome—­the 
actual improvement in the measures and the corresponding ROI—­are clear. This 
establishes the expectations throughout the program analysis, design, development, 
delivery, and implementation stages.
Beginning with the end in mind requires pinning down all the details to ensure 
that the program is properly planned and executed according to schedule. This 
up-­front analysis is not always simple, as it requires a disciplined approach, one 
that adds credibility and allows for consistent application so that the analysis can 
be replicated. A disciplined approach maintains process efficiency as various tools 
and templates are developed and used. This initial phase of analysis calls for focus 
and thoroughness, with little allowance for major shortcuts.
Not every program should be subjected to the type of comprehensive analysis 
described in this chapter. Some needs are obvious and require little analysis other 
than that necessary to develop the program. For example, the need for a safety 
program usually translates into specific safety measures that need to improve. 

Align with Business Needs
57
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Additional analysis may be needed to confirm that the program addresses the 
perceived need and perhaps to fine-­tune the program for future application. The 
amount of analysis required often depends on the expected opportunity to be 
gained if the program is appropriate or the negative consequences anticipated if 
the program is inappropriate.
When analysis is proposed, individuals may react with concern or resistance. 
Some are concerned about the potential for “paralysis by analysis,” where requests 
and directives lead only to additional analyses. These reactions can pose a prob-
lem for an organization, because analysis is necessary to ensure that a program is 
appropriate. Unfortunately, analysis is often misunderstood—­conjuring up images 
of complex problems, confusing models, and a deluge of data along with compli-
cated statistical techniques to ensure that all bases are covered. In reality, analysis 
need not be so complicated. Simple techniques can uncover the cause of a problem 
or the need for a particular program. The remainder of this chapter delves into the 
components of analysis that are necessary for a solid alignment between a program 
and the business, presented here as Figure 4.1.
Determining the Payoff Needs
The first step in up-­front analysis is to determine the potential payoff of solving a prob-
lem or seizing an opportunity. This step begins with answers to a few crucial questions: 
Is this program worth doing? Is it feasible? What is the likelihood of a positive ROI?
Figure 4.1.  Business alignment model.

58	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
For programs addressing significant problems or opportunities with high poten-
tial rewards, the answers are obvious. The questions may take longer to answer for 
lower-­profile programs or those for which the expected payoff is less apparent. In 
any case, these are legitimate questions, and the analysis can be as simple or as 
comprehensive as required.
Essentially, a program will pay off in profit increases or in cost savings. Profit 
increases are generated by programs that drive revenue—­for example, those that 
improve sales, drive market share, introduce new products, open new markets, 
enhance customer service, or increase customer loyalty. Other revenue-­generating 
measures include increasing membership, increasing donations, obtaining grants, 
and generating tuition from new and returning students—­all of which, after sub-
tracting the cost of doing business, should leave a profit.
However, most programs drive cost savings. Cost savings can come through 
cost reduction or cost avoidance. Improved quality, reduced cycle time, lowered 
downtime, reduced employee complaints, lower employee turnover, and minimized 
delays are all examples of cost savings.
Cost-­avoidance programs are implemented to reduce risks, avoid problems, or 
prevent unwanted events. Some professionals may view cost avoidance as an inappro-
priate measure to use to determine monetary benefits and calculate ROI. However, 
if the assumptions prove correct, an avoided cost (e.g., noncompliance fines) can be 
more rewarding than reducing an actual cost. Preventing a problem is more cost-­
effective than waiting for the problem to occur and then having to focus on solving it.
Although determining the potential payoff is the first step in the needs-­analysis 
process, it is closely related to the next step, determining the business need, since 
the potential payoff is often based on a consideration of the business. The payoff 
depends on two factors: (1) the monetary value derived from the business mea-
sure’s improvement and (2) the approximate cost of the program. Identifying these 
monetary values in detail usually yields a more credible forecast of what can be 
expected from the chosen solution. However, this step may be omitted in situations 
where the business need must be met regardless of the cost or if it becomes obvious 
that the proposed program has a high payoff.
The target level of detail may also hinge on the need to secure program funding. 
If the potential funding source does not recognize the value of the program com-
pared with the potential costs, more detail may be needed to provide a convincing 
case for funding.
Knowledge of the actual payoff is not necessary if widespread agreement exists that 
the payoff from the program will be high or if the problem in question must be resolved 
regardless of cost. For example, if the proposed program involves a safety concern, a 
regulatory compliance issue, or a competitive matter, a detailed analysis is not needed.
Obvious Versus Not-­So-­Obvious Payoffs
The potential payoff is obvious for some programs and not so obvious for others. 
Here are examples of opportunities for improvement with obvious payoffs:
•	 Operating costs 47 percent higher than industry average
•	 Customer satisfaction rating of 3.89 on a 10-­point scale
•	 A cost to the city of $75,000 annually for each homeless person

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Noncompliance fines totaling $1.2 million, up 82 percent from last year
•	 Turnover of critical talent 35 percent above benchmark figure
•	 System downtime twice the average of last year’s results
•	 Very low market share in a market with few players
•	 A safety record among the worst in the industry
•	 Excessive product returns, 30 percent higher than previous year
•	 Excessive absenteeism in call centers, 12.3 percent, compared to 5.4 percent 
industry average
•	 Sexual harassment complaints per thousand employees the highest in the industry
Each of these statements appears to reflect a serious problem that needs to be 
addressed by executives, administrators, or politicians. The business issue is clear. 
Action is needed.
For most other programs, the issues are unclear and may arise from political 
motives, bias, or misguided assumptions. The payoffs of these potential opportu-
nities are not so obvious, as in these examples:
•	 Becoming a “green” company
•	 Improving leadership competencies for all managers
•	 Improving branding for all products
•	 Creating a great place to work
•	 Implementing a physician engagement program
•	 Organizing a business development conference
•	 Establishing a program management office
•	 Providing job training for unemployed workers
•	 Implementing lean Six Sigma
•	 Training all team leaders on crucial conversations
•	 Providing training on sexual harassment awareness for all associates
•	 Developing an “open book” company
•	 Implementing the same workout process that GE has used
•	 Changing the culture
•	 Implementing a change management program
•	 Implementing a transformation program involving all employees
•	 Implementing a career advancement program
•	 Creating a wellness and fitness center
•	 Implementing a team-­building program
With each of these “opportunities,” there is a need for more specific detail regard-
ing the business measure in question. For example, if the opportunity is to become a 
“green” company, we should ask these questions: What is a green company? How will 
we know when we’re green? How is green defined? Programs with not-­so-­obvious 
payoffs require greater analysis than those with clearly defined outcomes.
The potential payoff establishes the fundamental reason for pursuing new or 
enhanced programs. But the payoff—­whether obvious or not—­is not the only rea-
son for moving forward with a program. The cost of a problem is another factor. If 
the cost is excessive, it should be addressed. If not, then a decision must be made 
whether the problem is worth solving.

The Cost of a Problem
Sometimes programs are undertaken to solve a problem. Problems are expensive, 
and their solution can result in high returns, especially when the solution is inex-
pensive. To determine the cost of a problem, examine its potential consequences 
and convert those to monetary values. Problems may encompass time, quality, 
productivity, and team or customer issues. To calculate the cost of a problem, all 
these factors must be converted to monetary values. Inventory shortages are often 
directly associated with the cost of the inventory as well as with the cost of car-
rying the inventory. Time can easily be translated into money by calculating the 
fully loaded cost of an individual’s time spent on unproductive tasks. Calculating 
the time for completing a program, task, or cycle involves measures that can be 
converted to money. Errors, mistakes, waste, delays, and bottlenecks can often 
be converted to money because of their consequences. Productivity problems and 
inefficiencies, equipment damage, and equipment underuse are other items whose 
conversion to monetary value is straightforward.
When examining costs, consider all the costs and their implications. For exam-
ple, the full cost of an accident includes not only the cost of lost workdays and 
medical expenses but its effects on insurance premiums, the time required for 
investigations, damage to equipment, and the time spent by all involved employ-
ees addressing the accident. The cost of a customer complaint includes not only 
the cost of the time spent resolving the complaint but also the value of the item or 
service that has to be adjusted because of the complaint. The costliest consequence 
of a customer complaint is the price to the company of lost future business and 
goodwill from the complaining customer and from potential customers who learn 
of the complaint. Placing a monetary value on a problem helps in determining if the 
problem’s resolutions are economically feasible. The same applies to opportunities.
The Value of an Opportunity
Sometimes programs are undertaken to pursue an opportunity. Just as the cost of 
a problem can be easily tabulated in most situations, the value of an opportunity 
can also be calculated. Examples of opportunities include implementing a new pro-
cess, exploring new technology, increasing research and development efforts, and 
upgrading the workforce to create a more competitive environment. In these situa-
tions, a problem may not exist, but an opportunity to get ahead of the competition 
or to prevent a problem’s occurrence by taking immediate action does. Assigning a 
proper value to this opportunity requires considering what may happen if the pro-
gram is not pursued or acknowledging the windfall that might be realized if the 
opportunity is seized. The value is determined by following the different possible 
scenarios to convert specific business impact measures to money. The difficulty in 
this process is conducting a credible analysis. Forecasting the value of an opportunity 
entails many assumptions compared with calculating the value of a known outcome.
To Forecast or Not to Forecast?
The need to seek and assign value to opportunities leads to an important decision: 
to forecast or not to forecast ROI. If the stakes are high and support for the pro-
gram is not in place, a detailed forecast may be the only way to gain the needed 

Align with Business Needs

support and funding for the program or to inform the choice between multiple 
potential programs. When developing the forecast, the rigor of the analysis is an 
issue. In some cases, an informal forecast is sufficient, given certain assumptions 
about alternative outcome scenarios. In other cases, a detailed forecast is needed 
that uses data collected from a variety of experts, previous studies from another 
program, or perhaps more sophisticated analysis. When the potential payoff, 
including its financial value, has been determined, the next step is to clarify the 
business needs.
Determining Business Needs
Determining the business needs requires the identification of specific measures so 
that the business situation can be clearly assessed. The concept of business needs 
refers to gains in productivity, quality, efficiency, time, and cost savings, in the pri-
vate sector as well as in government, nonprofit, and academic organizations.
A business need is represented by a business measure. Any process, item, or per-
ception can be measured, and such measurement is critical to this level of analysis. 
If the program focuses on solving a problem, preventing a problem, or seizing an 
opportunity, the measures are usually identifiable. The important point is that the 
measures are present in the system, ready to be captured for this level of analysis. 
The challenge is to define the measures and to find them economically and swiftly.
Hard Data Measures
To focus on the desired measures, distinguishing between hard data and soft data 
may be helpful. Hard data are primary measures of improvement presented in the 
form of rational, undisputed facts that are usually gathered within functional areas 
throughout an organization. These are the most desirable data because they are easy 
to quantify and are easily converted to monetary values. The fundamental criteria 
for gauging the effectiveness of an organization are hard data items such as revenue, 
productivity, and profitability, as well as measures that quantify such processes as 
cost control and quality assurance.
Hard data are objective and credible measures of an organization’s performance. 
Hard data can usually be grouped into four categories, as shown in Table 4.1. These 
categories—­output, quality, costs, and time—­are typical performance measures in 
any organization.
Hard data from a particular program involve improvements in the output of the 
work unit, section, department, division, or entire organization. Every organiza-
tion, regardless of the type, must have basic measures of output, such as number 
of patients treated, students graduated, tons produced, or packages shipped. Since 
these values are monitored, changes can easily be measured by comparing “before” 
and “after” outputs.
Quality is a very important hard data category. If quality is a major priority 
for the organization, processes are likely in place to measure and monitor quality. 
The rising prominence of quality-­improvement processes (such as Total Quality 
Management, Continuous Quality Improvement, and Six Sigma) has contributed 
to the tremendous recent successes in pinpointing proper quality measures—­and 
assigning monetary values to them.

62	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Cost is another important hard data category. Many programs are designed to 
lower, control, or eliminate the cost of a specific process or activity. Achieving cost 
targets has an immediate effect on the bottom line. Some organizations focus nar-
rowly on cost reduction. For example, consider Wal-­Mart, whose tagline is “Always 
low prices. Always.” All levels of the organization are dedicated to lowering costs on 
processes and products and passing the savings along to customers.
Time is a critical measure in any organization. Some organizations gauge their 
performance almost exclusively in relation to time. When asked what business 
FedEx is in, company executives say, “We engineer time.”
Soft Data Measures
Soft data are probably the most familiar measures of an organization’s effectiveness, 
yet their collection can present a challenge. Values representing attitude, moti-
vation, and satisfaction are examples of soft data. Soft data are more difficult to 
gather and analyze, and therefore they are used when hard data are not available or 
to supplement hard data. Soft data are also more difficult to convert to monetary 
values, a process requiring subjective methods. They are less objective as perfor-
mance measurements and are usually behavior related, yet organizations place great 
emphasis on them. Improvements in these measures represent important business 
needs, but many organizations omit them from the ROI equation because they are 
soft data. However, they can contribute to economic value to the same extent as 
hard data measures. The key is not to focus too much on the hard-­versus-­soft data 
distinction. A better approach is to consider data as tangible or intangible. Table 4.2 
shows common examples of soft data by category.

Tangible Versus Intangible Benefits: A Better Approach
A challenge with regard to soft versus hard data is converting soft measures to mon-
etary values. The key to this problem is to remember that, ultimately, all roads 
lead to hard data. Although creativity may be categorized as a form of soft data, a 
creative workplace can develop new products or new patents, which lead to greater 
revenue—­clearly a hard data measure. Although it is possible to convert the mea-
sures listed in Table 4.2 to monetary amounts, it is often more realistic and practical 
to leave them in nonmonetary form. This decision is based on considerations of 
credibility and the cost of the conversion. According to the standards of the ROI 
methodology, an intangible measure is defined as a measure that is intentionally 
not converted to money. If a soft data measure can be converted to a monetary 
amount credibly using minimal resources, it is considered tangible, reported as a 
monetary value, and incorporated in the ROI calculation. If a data item cannot be 
converted to money credibly with minimal resources, it is listed as an intangible

measure. Therefore, in defining business needs, the key difference between mea-
sures is not whether they represent hard or soft data but whether they are tangible 
or intangible. In either case, they are important contributions toward the desired 
payoff and important business-­impact data.
Business Data Sources
The sources of business data, whether tangible or intangible, are diverse. The data 
come from routine reporting systems in the organization. In many situations, these 
items have led to the need for the program. A vast array of documents, systems, 
databases, and reports can be used to select the specific measure or measures to be 
monitored throughout the program. Impact-­data sources include quality reports, 
service records, suggestion systems, and employee-­engagement data.
Some HR program planners and program team members assume that corpo-
rate data sources are scarce because the data are not readily available to them. 
However, data can usually be located by investing a small amount of time. Rarely 
do new data collection systems or processes need to be developed in order to iden-
tify data representing the business needs of an organization.
In searching for the proper measures to connect to the program and to iden-
tify business needs, it is helpful to consider all possible measures that could be 
influenced. Sometimes, collateral measures move in harmony with the program. 
For example, efforts to improve safety may also improve productivity and increase 
job satisfaction. Weighing adverse impacts on certain measures may also help. For 
example, when cycle times are reduced, quality may suffer; when sales increase, 
customer satisfaction may deteriorate. Finally, program team members must antic-
ipate unintended consequences and capture them as other data items that might be 
connected to or influenced by the program.
In the process of settling on the precise business measures for the program, it is 
useful to examine various “what if” scenarios. If the organization does nothing, the 
potential consequences of inaction should be made clear. The following questions 
may help in understanding the consequences of inaction:
•	 Will the situation deteriorate?
•	 Will operational problems surface?
•	 Will budgets be affected?
•	 Will we lose influence or support?
Answers to these questions can help the organization settle on a precise set of 
measures and can provide a hint of the extent to which the measures may change 
as a result of the program.
Determining Performance Needs
The next step in the needs analysis is to understand what led to the business need. 
If the proposed program addresses a problem, this step focuses on the cause of the 
problem. If the program makes use of an opportunity, this step focuses on what is 
inhibiting the organization from taking advantage of that opportunity. This step 
determines the performance needs.

Align with Business Needs
65
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Uncovering the causes of the problem or the inhibitors to success requires a vari-
ety of analytical techniques. These techniques—­such as problem analysis, nominal 
group technique, force-­field analysis, and just plain brainstorming—­are used to 
clarify job performance needs. Table 4.3 lists a few of the analysis techniques. The 
technique that is used will depend on the organizational setting, the apparent depth 
of the problem, and the budget allocated to such analysis. Multiple techniques can 
be used, since performance may be lacking for a number of reasons.
Analysis takes time and adds to a program’s cost. Examining records, research-
ing databases, and observing individuals can provide important data, but a more 
cost-­effective approach might include employing internal and/or external experts 
to help analyze the problem. Performance needs can vary considerably and may 
include ineffective behavior, a dysfunctional work climate, inadequate systems, a 
disconnected process flow, improper procedures, a nonsupportive culture, outdated 
technology, and a nonaccommodating environment, to name a few. When needs 
vary and there are many techniques to choose from, the potential exists for overan-
alysis and excessive costs. Consequently, a sensible approach is needed.
Determining Learning Needs
The solution to the performance needs uncovered in the previous step often requires 
a learning component—­such as participants and team members learning how to 
perform a task differently or how to use a process or system. In some cases, learn-
ing is the principal solution, as in competency or capability development, major 
technology change, and system installations. For other programs, learning is a 
minor aspect of the solution and may involve simply understanding the process, 
procedure, or policy. For example, in the implementation of a new ethics policy for 
an organization, the learning component requires understanding how the policy 
works as well as the participants’ role in the policy. In short, a learning solution is 
not always needed, but all solutions have a learning component.

Various approaches are available for measuring specific learning needs. Often, 
multiple tasks and jobs are involved in a program and should be addressed sepa-
rately. Sometimes the least effective way to identify the skills and knowledge that 
are needed is to ask the participants involved in implementing the program. They 
may not be clear on what is needed and may not know enough to provide ade-
quate input. One of the most useful ways to determine learning needs is to ask the 
individuals who understand the process. They can best determine what skills and 
knowledge are necessary to address the performance issues that have been identi-
fied. This may be the appropriate time to find out the extent to which the knowledge 
and skills already exist.
Job and task analysis is effective when a new job is created or when an exist-
ing job description changes significantly. As jobs are redesigned and the new tasks 
must be identified, this type of analysis offers a systematic way of detailing the job 
and task. Essentially, a job analysis is the collection and evaluation of work-­related 
information. A task analysis identifies the specific knowledge, skills, tools, and con-
ditions necessary for the performance of a particular job.
Observation of current practices and procedures in an organization may be nec-
essary as the program is implemented. This can often indicate the level of capability 
and help identify the correct procedures. Observations can be used to examine 
work flow and interpersonal interactions, including those between management 
and team members. Observers may be previous employees, third-­party participant 
observers, or mystery shoppers.
Sometimes, the demonstration of knowledge surrounding a certain task, pro-
cess, or procedure provides evidence of what capabilities exist and what are lacking. 
This demonstration can be as simple as a skill practice or role play or as complex as 
an extensive mechanical or electronic simulation. The point is to use this as a way 
of determining if employees know how to perform a particular process. Through 
demonstration, specific learning needs can evolve.
Testing as a learning needs assessment process is not used as frequently as other 
methods, but it can be very useful. Employees are tested to reveal what they know 
about a particular situation. This information helps guide learning issues.
In implementing programs in organizations where there is an existing manager 
or team leader, input from the management team may be used to assess the current 
situation and to indicate the knowledge and skills required by the new situation. 
This input can be elicited through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. It can be 
a rich source of information about what the users of the program, if it is imple-
mented, will need to know to make it successful.
Where learning is a minor component, learning needs are simple. Determin-
ing learning needs can be very time-­consuming for major programs in which new 
procedures, technologies, and processes must be developed. As in developing job 
performance needs, it is important not to spend excessive time analyzing learning 
needs but rather to collect as much data as possible with minimal resources.
Determining Preference Needs
The final level of needs analysis determines the preferences that drive the pro-
gram requirements. Essentially, individuals prefer certain processes, schedules, or 

Align with Business Needs
67
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
activities for the structure of the program. These preferences define how the par-
ticular program will be implemented. If the program is a solution to a problem, 
this step defines how the solution will be executed. If the program makes use of an 
opportunity, this step outlines how the opportunity will be addressed, taking into 
consideration the preferences of those involved in the program.
Preference needs typically define the parameters of the program in terms of 
scope, timing, budget, staffing, location, technology, deliverables, and the degree of 
disruption allowed. Preference needs are developed from the input of several stake-
holders rather than from one individual. For example, participants in the program 
(those who must make it work) may have a particular preference, but the preference 
could exhaust resources, time, and budgets. The immediate manager’s input may 
help minimize the amount of disruption and maximize resources. The funds that 
can be allocated are also a constraining resource.
The urgency of program implementation may introduce a constraint on the 
preferences. Those who support or own the program often impose preferences on 
the program in terms of timing, budget, and the use of technology. Because prefer-
ences correspond to a Level 1 need, the program structure and solution will relate 
directly to the reaction objectives and to the initial reaction to the program.
In determining the preference needs, there can never be too much detail. Pro-
grams often go astray and fail to reach their full potential because of misunder-
standings and differences in expectations surrounding the program. Preference 
needs should be addressed before the program begins. Pertinent issues are often 
outlined in the program proposal or planning documentation.
Case Study: Southeast Corridor Bank
At this point, following a case study through the different levels of needs may be 
helpful. The following discussion explores the analysis at Level 5, determining pay-
off needs. Southeast Corridor Bank (SCB) operated branches in six states. (SCB 
has since been acquired by Regions Bank, one of the nation’s top ten banks.) Like 
many other fast-­growing organizations, SCB faced merger and integration prob-
lems, including excessive employee turnover. An HR manager was assigned the task 
of reducing the voluntary turnover.3
The Analysis
SCB’s annual employee turnover was 57 percent, compared with an industry aver-
age of 26 percent. The first step in addressing the problem was answering these 
questions:
•	 Is this a problem worth solving?
•	 Is there a potential payoff to solving the problem?
To the senior vice president of human resources, the answers were clear. After 
reviewing several published studies about the cost of turnover—­including one from 
a financial institution—­he concluded that the cost of employee turnover ranged 
between 110 and 225 percent of annual pay. At the current rate, employee turn-
over was costing the bank more than $6 million per year. Lowering the rate to the 

68	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
industry average would save the bank at least $3 million annually. Although the 
structure and cost of the solution had not been determined at this point, it became 
clear that this problem was worth solving. Unless the solution appeared to be very 
expensive, solving the problem would have a tremendous impact. This was the only 
analysis that was needed at this level.
The specific measure in question was voluntary turnover: the number of employ-
ees leaving voluntarily divided by the average number of employees, expressed as a 
percentage. Clearly defining the measure was important. Still, with improvement 
in any one measure, other measures should also improve, depending on the specific 
solution. For example, staffing levels, job satisfaction, customer service, sales rev-
enue, and other measures could change. These considerations are detailed in the 
context of determining the solution.
To identify the job performance needs, the cause of the problem had to be deter-
mined. When the cause was determined, a solution could be developed.
The nominal group technique was selected as the analysis method because it 
allowed unbiased input to be collected efficiently and accurately across the organi-
zation. Focus groups were planned consisting of twelve employees from each region, 
for a total of six groups representing all the regions. In addition, two focus groups 
were planned for the clerical staff in the corporate headquarters. This approach 
provided approximately a 10 percent sample, which was considered sufficient to 
pinpoint the problem.
The focus group participants who represented areas in which turnover was high-
est described why their colleagues were leaving, not why they themselves would 
leave. Data were collected from individuals using a carefully structured format—­
during two-­hour meetings at each location, with third-­party facilitators—­and were 
integrated and weighted so that the most important reasons were clearly identified. 
This process had the advantages of low cost and high reliability, as well as a low 
degree of bias. Only two days of external facilitator time were needed to collect and 
summarize the data for review.
The following are the ten major reasons given for turnover in the bank branches:
	 1.	 Lack of opportunity for advancement
	 2.	 Lack of opportunity to learn new skills and gain new product knowledge
	 3.	 Pay level not adequate
	 4.	 Not enough responsibility and empowerment
	 5.	 Lack of recognition and appreciation of work
	 6.	 Lack of teamwork
	 7.	 Lack of preparation for customer service problems
	 8.	 Unfair and nonsupportive supervisors
	 9.	 Too much stress at peak times
	10.	 Not enough flexibility in work schedules
A similar list was developed for the administrative staff. However, the remainder 
of this case study will focus on the efforts to reduce turnover in the branch network. 
Branch turnover was the most critical issue, because of its high rate and the large 
number of employees involved, and the focus group results provided a clear pattern 
of specific needs. Recognizing that not all causes of the turnover could be addressed 

Align with Business Needs
69
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
immediately, the bank’s management concentrated on the top five reasons and con-
sidered a variety of options.
The Solution
The program manager determined that a skill-­based pay system would address the top 
five reasons for employee turnover. The program was designed to expand the scope of 
the jobs, with increases in pay awarded for the acquisition of skills and a clear path 
provided for advancement and improvement. Jobs were redesigned from narrowly 
focused duties to an expanded role with a new title: Every teller became a banking 
representative I, II, or III.
A branch employee would be designated a banking representative I if he or she 
could perform one or two simple tasks, such as processing deposits and cashing 
checks. As an employee at this level took on additional responsibilities and learned 
to perform different functions, he or she would be eligible for a promotion to bank-
ing representative II. A representative who could perform all the basic functions of 
the branch, including processing consumer loan applications, would be promoted 
to banking representative III.
Training opportunities were made available to help employees develop the 
needed skills, and structured on-­the-­job training was provided by the branch man-
agers, assistant managers, and supervisors. Self-­study information was also avail-
able. The performance of multiple tasks was introduced to broaden responsibilities 
and enable employees to provide excellent customer service. Pay increases were 
used to recognize skill acquisition, demonstrated accomplishment, and increased 
responsibility.
Although the skill-­based system had obvious advantages from the employee’s 
perspective, the bank also benefited. Not only was turnover expected to decline, but 
required staffing levels were expected to decrease in the larger branches. In theory, 
if all employees in a branch could perform all the necessary duties, fewer employees 
would be needed. Previously, certain critical jobs required minimum staffing levels, 
and employees in those positions were not always available for other duties.
In addition, the bank anticipated improved customer service. The new approach 
would prevent customers from having to wait in long lines for specialized services. 
For example, in the typical bank branch, long lines for special functions—­such 
as opening a checking account, closing out a certificate of deposit, or accepting a 
consumer loan application—­were not unusual under the old setup, whereas rou-
tine activities such as paying bills and receiving deposits often required little or no 
waiting. With each employee now performing all the tasks, shorter waiting lines 
could be expected.
To support this new arrangement, the marketing department featured the con-
cept in its publicity about products and services. Included with checking account 
statements was a promotional piece stating, “In our branches, there are no tellers.” 
This document described the new process and announced that every employee 
could now perform all branch functions and consequently provide faster service.
More Analysis
At Level 2, learning needs fell into two categories. First, for each learning program, 
both skill acquisition and knowledge development needs were identified. Learning

measurements included self-­assessment, testing, and demonstrations, among oth-
ers, and were connected to each specific program.
Second, it was necessary for employees to learn how the new program worked. 
As the program was introduced in meetings with employees, a simple measure-
ment of learning was necessary to capture employee understanding of the following 
issues:
•	 How the program is being pursued
•	 What employees must do to succeed in the program
•	 How promotion decisions are made
•	 The timing of various stages of the program
These major learning needs were identified and connected specifically with the 
solution being implemented.
As the program was rolled out and the solution was developed, the preference 
needs were defined. The program had to be rolled out as soon as possible so that its 
effects could be translated into lower employee turnover. All the training programs 
had to be in place and available to employees. The amount of time employees must 
spend away from their jobs for training was an issue, as was the managers’ con-
trol over the timing of promotions. This process had to move swiftly, or it would 
result in disappointment to employees who were eager to be trained and promoted. 
At the same time, the staffing and workload concerns had to be balanced so that 
the appropriate amount of time was devoted to training and skill building. More 
specifically, with the program’s announcement, the desired employee reaction was 
defined. Program leaders wanted employees to view the program as very challeng-
ing, motivational, rewarding, and fair and as a solid investment in their futures. 
These needs were easily translated into the solution design.
Developing Objectives for HR Programs
Programs are driven by objectives. These objectives will position the program for 
success if they represent the needs of the business and include clearly defined 
measures of achievement. A program may be aimed at implementing a solution 
that addresses a particular dilemma, problem, or opportunity. In other situations, 
the initial program is designed to develop a range of feasible solutions, with one 
specific solution selected prior to implementation. Regardless of the program, 
multiple levels of objectives are necessary. These levels follow the five-­level data 
categorization scheme and define precisely what will occur as a program is imple-
mented. They correspond to the levels of evaluation and the levels of needs pre-
sented in Figure 4.1.
Reaction Objectives
For a program to be successful, the stakeholders immediately involved in the pro-
cess must react favorably—­or at least not negatively—­to the program. Ideally, 
those directly involved should be satisfied with the program and see the value in 
it. This feedback must be obtained routinely during the program in order to make 
adjustments, keep the program on track, and redesign certain aspects as necessary. 

Align with Business Needs
71
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Unfortunately, for many programs, specific objectives at this level are not developed, 
nor are data collection mechanisms put in place to allow channels for feedback.
Developing reaction objectives should be straightforward and relatively easy. 
The objectives reflect the degree of immediate as well as long-­term satisfaction and 
explore issues important to the success of the program. They also form the basis 
for evaluating the chain of impact, and they emphasize planned action, when this 
is feasible and needed. Typical issues addressed in the development of reaction 
objectives are relevance, usefulness, importance, appropriateness, rewards, and 
motivation.
Learning Objectives
Every program involves at least one learning objective, and most involve more. With 
programs entailing major change, the learning component is quite important. In 
situations narrower in scope, such as the implementation of a new policy, the learn-
ing component is minor but still necessary. To ensure that the various stakeholders 
have learned what they need to know to make the program successful, learning 
objectives are developed. The following are examples of learning objectives.
After the launch of the program, participants should be able to do the following:
•	 Identify the six features of the new ethics policy.
•	 Demonstrate the use of each software routine within the standard time.
•	 Score 75 or better on the new-­product quiz.
•	 Explain the value of diversity in a work group.
•	 Successfully complete the leadership simulation.
•	 Know how to apply for housing assistance.
Objectives are critical to the measurement of learning because they commu-
nicate the expected outcomes from the learning component and define the com-
petency or level of performance necessary to make the program successful. They 
provide a focus to allow participants to clearly identify what it is they must learn 
and do—­sometimes with precision.
Application Objectives
The application and implementation objectives clearly define what is expected of 
the program and often the target level of performance. Application objectives are 
similar to learning objectives but relate to actual performance. They provide specific 
milestones indicating when one part or all of the process has been implemented. 
Examples of typical application objectives are as follows:
•	 Within one year, 10 percent of employees will submit documented suggestions 
for cutting costs.
•	 Ninety-­five percent of high-­potential employees will complete individual 
development plans within two years.
•	 Forty percent of the city’s homeless population will apply for special housing 
within one year of program launch.
•	 Eighty percent of employees will use one or more of the three cost containment 
features of the healthcare plan.

72	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Fifty percent of conference attendees will follow up with at least one contact 
from the conference.
•	 The average 360-­degree leadership assessment score will improve from 3.4 to 
4.1 on a 5-­point scale.
•	 Employees will routinely use problem-­solving skills when faced with a quality 
problem.
•	 Sexual harassment activity will cease within three months after the zero-­
tolerance policy is implemented.
•	 At least 99.1 percent of software users will be following the correct sequences 
after three weeks of use.
•	 By November, pharmaceutical sales reps will communicate adverse effects of a 
specific prescription drug to all physicians in their territories.
•	 Managers will initiate three workout programs within fifteen days.
•	 Sales and customer service representatives will use all five interaction skills 
with at least half the customers within the next month.
Application objectives are critical because they describe the expected outcomes 
in the intermediate area—­between the learning of new tasks and procedures and 
the delivery of the impact of this learning. Application and implementation objec-
tives describe how things should be or the desired state of the workplace once the 
program solution has been implemented. They provide a basis for evaluating on-­
the-­job changes and performance.
Impact Objectives
Every program should drive improvement in one or more business-­impact mea-
sures. Impact objectives indicate key business measures that should improve as the 
application and implementation objectives are achieved. The following are typical 
impact objectives:
•	 System downtime should be reduced from three hours per month to no more 
than two hours per month in six months.
•	 Incidents should decrease by 20 percent within the next calendar year.
•	 The average number of product defects should decrease from 214 to 153 per 
month in the Midwest region.
•	 The customer satisfaction index should rise by 2 percent during the next cal-
endar year.
•	 Sales expenses for all titles at Proof Publishing Company should decrease by 10 
percent in the fourth quarter.
•	 The average number of new accounts opened at Great Western Bank should 
increase from 300 to 350 per month in six months.
•	 The shelter costs per homeless person should be below $70,000 in two years.
•	 There should be an across-­the-­board reduction in overtime for front-­of-­house 
managers at Tasty Time restaurants in the third quarter of this year.
•	 Employee complaints should be reduced from an average of three per month 
to an average of one per month at Guarantee Insurance headquarters.
•	 The company-wide employee engagement index should rise by one point 
during the next calendar year.

•	 There should be a 10 percent increase in Pharmaceuticals Inc. brand awareness 
among physicians during the next two years.
•	 The dropout rate for high school students in the Barett County system should 
decrease by 5 percent within three years.
Impact objectives are critical to measuring business performance because 
they define the ultimate expected outcome from the program. They describe the 
business unit performance that should result from the program. Above all, impact 
objectives emphasize achievement of the bottom-­line results that key client groups 
expect and demand.
ROI Objectives
The fifth level of objectives for programs represents the acceptable return on 
investment—­the monetary impact. Objectives at this level define the expected 
payoff from investing in the program. An ROI objective is typically expressed as 
an acceptable ROI percentage: annual monetary benefits minus cost, divided by 
the actual cost, and multiplied by one hundred. A zero percent ROI indicates a 
breakeven program. A 50 percent ROI indicates recapture of the program cost and 
an additional 50 percent “earnings” (50 cents for every dollar invested).
For some programs, such as the purchase of a new company, a new building, or 
major equipment, the ROI objective is large relative to the ROI of other expendi-
tures. However, the calculation is the same for both. For many organizations, the 
ROI objective for a program is set slightly higher than the ROI expected from other 
“routine investments” because of the relative newness of applying the ROI concept 
to the types of programs described in this book. For example, if the expected ROI 
from the purchase of a new company is 20 percent, the ROI from a new recruiting 
program might be around 25 percent. The important point is that the ROI objec-
tive should be established up front and in discussions with the program sponsor. 
Excluding the ROI objective leaves stakeholders questioning the economic success 
of a program. If a program reaps a 25 percent ROI, is that successful? Not if the 
objective was a 50 percent ROI.
Human Capital Strategy Implications
Because of the importance of business alignment, it should be included as part of 
human capital strategy. The following items should be addressed in the strategic 
plan:
•	 The method or process used to connect projects to business needs
•	 The percentage of programs that will be aligned through this method
•	 The specific criteria for deciding which programs to align to business needs (if 
not all of them)
•	 How and when business alignment is validated in follow-­up

T
alent management is one of the most important strategic objectives of compa-
nies today, many CHROs have the primary responsibility for the talent man-
agement system. The CHRO’s role represents a great opportunity to add value to 
the organization by acquiring, developing, and retaining critical talent. This chapter 
explores the importance of talent in the organization. From every viewpoint, talent 
is essential, and it is often regarded as a key strategy for maintaining a competi-
tive advantage. A systems approach to talent management is needed for success, 
efficiency, and consistency. The systems approach follows a step-­by-­step process, 
beginning with attracting talent and ending with removing unwanted talent.
Opening Story: Tata Group
Tata is India’s largest enterprise group, with businesses in seven sectors, represent-
ing 100 companies, operations in some 80 countries, more than 500,000 employees, 
and annual revenue in excess of $100 billion. In recent years, it has grown through a 
series of strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. Global growth and diversity have 
brought a complex mix of talent management challenges. Tata receives more than 
58 percent of its revenue from outside of India.1
Tata’s HR and talent organization has become skilled at determining the value 
(real and potential) of the people in the companies it acquires, as well as risk man-
agement and talent capture. Risk management involves assessing the culture of an 
Force 3: Talent Management. A very critical part of the human 
capital strategy must focus on managing talent for value. Every 
organization is faced with the serious issue of attracting, select-
ing, motivating, maintaining, and retaining critical staff. The human 
resources function, particularly the chief human resources officer, 
is responsible for managing talent. In today’s competitive market, 
managing talent must be accomplished with value in mind, deliv-
ering value to and enabling the success of the organization.

acquired company. HR works alongside finance and strategy to ascertain “where the 
target company has come from” and how it has dealt with challenges in the past, 
says Satish Pradhan, who recently retired as executive vice president of group human 
resources. “You need to understand their fears, their drama, and their anxieties.” By 
providing insight into the acquired company’s readiness for change and the distance 
between its culture and Tata’s, the talent team helps mitigate risk. This process, 
which stretches through postmerger integrations, can take one to two years.
Talent capture is all about unlocking the ambition and potential of a leadership 
team that may be dispirited by a history of challenging performance or subordina-
tion to short-­term goals. Pradhan grew accustomed to stories of resignation and 
even despair: “They’d say things like, ‘Why don’t you guys just tell us what you 
want us to do.’” When Tata sees opportunity in an acquisition candidate, it seeks to 
unlock potential at the outset by creating a shared vision: What does the company 
aspire to be, and how can Tata enable that aspiration? “Initially there is cynicism 
and disbelief and ‘What are they not telling us? What’s the game here?’” Pradhan 
says. “Then, over time, they realize that we are actually serious about what we’re 
saying. We actually want the acquired company to have aspirations.”2
Talent Management Issues
Let’s review the basic issues of talent management. These fundamentals begin to 
define the scope and importance of talent.
Critical Roles and Succession Management
The CHRO should create a process for evaluating critical roles within the organi-
zation. Sometimes, people who are in critical jobs are not the best performers, and 
the best performers are not in critical jobs. A successful talent management system 
identifies critical jobs in the organization and finds ways to ensure that current and 
back-­up incumbents are top performers. Figure 5.1 provides an example of the type 
of data collected for talent management.
An executive talent management system also plans for organizational transitions. 
Some companies have extensive succession plans for several layers of management;

others only create plans for the top leaders in the company. To avoid disruption in 
business performance, it is critical that the company plan for departures of talent. 
Evaluating ready-­now talent, growing internal leaders, and sourcing external talent 
are all responsibilities of CHROs who manage talent in their companies. Essentially, 
organizations have shifted from success planning to succession management.
Another key element of a successful talent management system is a clear process 
for identifying and developing high potentials—­people in the organization who are 
identified as the next leaders in the company. Many organizations carefully review 
and manage a small segment of their talent as high potentials. Others do not clearly 
segment out this group or provide preferential development or treatment. Either 
way, understanding who top performers are and fostering their development pro-
vides greater chances for business and leadership success.
Talent Movement
Companies inherently struggle with movement of talent because of the gaps it can 
leave in an organization. Talent mobility occurs when movement of talent hap-
pens regularly and has minimal impact on the business. If an employee’s skills can 
be better used in another function, business leaders should support moving that 
individual. Unfortunately, many managers become territorial and fear gaps in their 
departments. Planning for these gaps and creating a culture that believes talent 
belongs to the company—­not a specific department—­takes time and effort. When 
managed appropriately, there should be no gaps, because the talent management 
system is so robust that it can fill the openings quite quickly.
Before the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) rules on segment 
reporting, many companies had centralized talent pools that could be used across 
the company transparently. For example, a centralized engineering function would 
enable engineering leads in the businesses to pull on resources with specific skill 
sets. Today, companies have typically aligned functional employees in a business, 
which limits movement or rotations. Formal rotation programs have flourished to 
simulate the concept of a centralized pool of talent. These programs enable new 
graduates or existing employees to work for different functions during their rotation 
assignments. Finance departments, for example, use this model quite frequently 
with new MBA graduates. A rotation program that exposes the grad to financial 
accounting, financing strategy, financial analysis, and, sometimes, tax/treasury 
issues provides robust experiences and develops talent effectively for future career 
mobility. At the end of the formal program, the employee can select a function, 
manager, or group for his or her work assignment. This provides the employee with 
exposure to different functions and develops his or her skills, which enables more 
growth and talent readiness as needs arise.
Talent Management Outcomes
Many CHROs share information about company-­wide organizational talent with 
the executive team and sometimes the board of directors. Providing exposure to 
management about the number of employees with international experience, the 
number of leaders with marketing education, or the percentage of employees with 
advanced degrees can provide critical information for business planning. Boards 
have an increasing interest in understanding the talent within a company as well

as strategies for acquisition, development, and retention. CHROs are in a critical 
position as keepers of the talent profile of a company.
Table 5.1 shows how the talent management measurement systems are changing. 
The traditional group of measures of talent management focused on activity; the 
emerging group is focused on results, using the methods described in Chapters 4 
and 14. The Institute for Corporate Productivity and AMA Enterprise (Talent Trans-
formation Section) recently conducted a study that compared high-­performing and 
low-­performing organizations on issues affecting talent. They found that high-­
performing organizations, challenged by the uncertainty of continuous change, 
turned to workforce analytics and workforce planning to gain visibility of gaps per-
taining to critical roles and skills needed to support sustainable business success. 
Transparency was identified as a common thread that correlates with effectiveness 
in virtually all talent processes and programs. This applies to everything from ensur-
ing employees know where they stand with regards to their work expectations, 
progress, and development opportunities, to establishing accurate visibility into 
specific talent pools within the workforce, as well as building and communicating 
organizational strategy. In the future, transparency must be purposely incorporated 
into organizations to ensure high performance.3
Talent Analytics
Human capital analytics practices have been developed throughout major organiza-
tions, and these practices are tackling all kinds of issues. In a recent study of more 
than one hundred organizations with dedicated human capital analytics practices, the 
number-­one area the practices were serving was in the recruiting and selection

process.4 In this scenario, the analytics are used to understand the effectiveness of 
different recruiting sources and selection processes. Not only do the analytics track 
effectiveness in terms of correlation and causation; they are also developed into 
models that can be used in the processes to predict which individuals will be more 
successful. This is a great development that holds much promise for the future, 
particularly for the high-­performance organization.5
Talent Mismanagement
The unfortunate reality is that most organizations have not addressed critical talent 
management issues. There have been some mismanagement practices. Another 
report showed that the majority of organizations are ineffectively employing 
important talent capabilities. Consequently, the workforce is not performing to its 
potential, and gaps in leadership and critical roles exist due to failure to develop 
adequate bench strength and ineffective development of leadership competencies 
throughout the organization. This is particularly true for performance manage-
ment, succession planning, and leadership development. The high-­performing 
organizations reviewed in the study were much better at this, but still there is much 
room for improvement.6 This chapter focuses on many of the issues that need to be 
addressed to avoid talent mismanagement.
Why Talent Is Critical to Success
Talent is considered the most critical source of success in an organization, and no 
executive will argue this point. How did it get this way? How critical is it now? How 
critical will it be in the future? There are several major reasons talent is so important 
and will be even more critical in the future. While these reasons were presented in 
Chapter 1, a few others are briefly described in the following pages.
Talent Adds to Market Value
When considering the value and importance of talent, you need look no further 
than the stock market. Investors place a tremendous value on talent in organi-
zations. The balance sheets of very progressive knowledge industries reveal the 
dramatic difference talent makes. When you compare the market capitalization to 
the assets listed on the balance sheet, there is a big difference. Investors see some-
thing that has a value much greater than the assets listed on the balance sheet. 
This “hidden value,” as it is sometimes called, comes from intangible assets, which 
now represent major portions of the value of organizations, particularly those in 
knowledge industries. Talent makes up a big part of intangible assets.
The Best Idea Will Fail Without Proper Talent and Execution
Talent management is fundamentally about ensuring that the right people are posi-
tioned in the right places and utilized to the fullest potential for optimal success of 
the organization. Business leaders clearly understand their talent pool. They work 
hard to identify the key players who have critical relationships with customers and 
suppliers, and then they work even harder to nurture and keep those key resources.
A number of business leaders have asserted that acquiring and developing the 
best talent for their companies is the most important task they have to perform. 

80	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
These leaders put a premium on keeping the talent they need for growth. They do 
what is necessary to ensure that key people are secure and do not leave because of 
low morale, thus preventing a defection domino effect.
Talent Is a Major Source of Competitive Advantage
Today’s organizations have access to most of the key success factors. Financial 
resources are available to almost any organization with a viable business model. 
One company no longer has an advantage over another to access the financial cap-
ital needed to run a business. Access to technology is equal; a company can readily 
adapt technology to a given situation or business model. It is difficult to have a 
technology advantage in an information technology society.
Businesses also have relatively equal access to customers, even if there is a domi-
nant player in the market. Newspapers are laced with stories of small organizations 
taking on larger ones and succeeding. Having entry and access to a customer data-
base is not necessarily a competitive advantage. What makes the difference, clearly, 
is the talent of the organization.
Companies Want to Be Talent Magnets
Probably no document about the importance of talent is more visible than the list 
of organizations selected as the “100 Best Companies to Work For” in America. This 
list is published each year in Fortune magazine and has become the bellwether for 
focusing on the importance of talent. Although other publications have spin-­offs, 
this is the premier list that organizations strive to make. The most important factor 
in selecting companies for this list is what the employees themselves have to say 
about their workplaces. For a typical list, at least 350 randomly selected employees 
from each candidate company fill out a survey created by The Great Place to Work 
Institute based in San Francisco.7 For more methodology on these criteria for this 
list, please see www.Fortune.com.
These lists are alive with tales of how employers focus on building a great place 
to work and building employee respect, dignity, capability, and talent. These firms 
are successful in the market. A typical list includes well-­known and successful com-
panies such as American Express, Cisco Systems, FedEx, Eli Lilly, Marriott Inter-
national, General Mills, Merck, Microsoft, Proctor & Gamble, QUALCOMM, and 
others. Inclusion in the list has become so sought after by organizations that they 
change many of their practices and philosophies in an attempt to make this list. This 
list underscores the importance of talent and how much emphasis companies place 
on it. It shows how diversity, job growth, turnover, and learning make a significant 
difference in an organization. For the most part, these organizations are investing 
heavily in human capital—­far exceeding those on any other list. Investment, in their 
minds, translates into payoff.
Talent Is a Game Changer
A group of Harvard professors studied three very successful organizations to try 
to understand what made them so effective. One organization was BlackRock, the 
world’s largest asset management firm, with a tremendous track record. Another 
was Envision Energy, a very successful Chinese company, and the third was Tata 
Group, a very successful conglomerate in India with more than 500,000 employees. 

Manage Talent for Value
81
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
These very successful companies had one important common thread: they each had 
a very effective talent management strategy.8 Collectively, their work developed very 
precise actions that an organization should take to have a game-­changing talent 
strategy. Table 5.2 lists the statements that an employee can make in a company 
with highly successful talent policies and practices.
Talent Is a Major Expense
Successful talent acquisition and management is expensive. The total investment 
in competent talent is the total HR department expenses for talent management 
plus the salaries and benefits of the talent. HR expenses include every function that 
exists in the chain of talent acquisition and management. Attracting, selecting, 
developing, motivating, compensating, and managing talent are accounted for in 
this total cost. Because the traditional HR department expenses do not include 
salaries of other functions, this broader measure has the effect of showing the total 
cost of talent. It should be reported as a percentage of operating costs or revenue or 
on a per-­employee basis to show realistic comparisons with other organizations. All 
direct employee-­related costs are included in the human capital measure.
Executives in some organizations realize the magnitude of these expenses and 
have a desire to manage them efficiently. Although the costs do not include office 
space and support expenses, they are still very significant, often two to three times 
an employee’s annual pay. In many—­if not most—­industries, the cost of talent is 
the largest operating expense category. Because talent is so expensive, it must be 
managed carefully and systematically.
Talent Departures Are Extremely Costly
When talent leaves, the costs are high. Executives see the direct cost of recruit-
ing, selection, and initial training, but they may not understand other impacts. 
The total cost of turnover is not calculated routinely in organizations. When the

cost is estimated, it is often underestimated. Estimations of the total cost are also 
not communicated throughout the organization, leaving the management team 
unaware of the potential costs. If turnover is a problem, the costs are always sig-
nificant. In some cases, the actual impact can be devastating and can result in the 
organization’s demise.
The total cost of turnover involves both the direct and indirect costs. Figure 5.2 
lists the costs in the sequence in which they occur. This figure suggests that there 
are many different costs, some of which are never known with certainty but can be 
estimated if enough attention is directed to the issue.
As Table 3.3 showed, these costs are significant. There is healthy turnover in any 
organization—­people who retire, leave to work in nonprofit organizations, or go 
back to school. The area of most concern in managing talent is when top performers 
or critical employees depart their jobs unexpectedly. The CHRO’s role is emerging to 
manage this turnover successfully and on-­board new employees quickly. In an ideal 
scenario, the CHRO is prepared with talent sources, so there are no gaps in organi-
zational performance or product road maps. Managing talent in an organization is 
a critical responsibility. CHROs must be aware of talent needs, know the sourcing 
strategies for aligning great talent, be prepared to build capable talent internally, 
and manage the employment brand.
Summary: Why Talent Is Critical
It may be helpful to summarize this information, which clearly details the critical 
role of talent in the organization. Table 5.3 provides a quick summary, showing 
many of the reasons talent is critical to success. The remainder of this chapter 
describes a system to provide the focus, attention, and care needed for this stra-
tegic issue.

Needed: A System for Talent Management
The most effective way to tackle talent management is to use a systems approach, 
ensuring that the different elements and pieces of the process are working in con-
cert to acquire and integrate talent into the system. Several issues support the need 
for this system.
Disconnected Efforts
The traditional way to deal with this issue is to have the responsibility assigned to vari-
ous groups that cut across functional HR lines. Recruiting, learning and development, 
reward systems, and employee relations are traditional functional groups. Several 
problems may surface with this approach. First, in this traditional HR model, tal-
ent management is in a reactive mode, reacting to critical issues, problems, and 
talent shortages. There are few early signs—­other than the lack of communica-
tion between groups—­to signal an impending problem. Also, because individuals 
involved are not tightly integrated with open communication, inefficiencies abound 
in the processes, often creating duplications and delays throughout the system. 
Consequently, this is a very expensive approach to the problem—­one that fails to 
generate the success needed and leaves voids, omissions, and delays. The results can 
be disastrous for an organization in need of talent and attempting to grow. Most 
of all, the traditional approach creates confusion—­not only in roles and responsi-
bilities but in the process of designating who is in charge. This confusion can be 
minimized by a systems approach.

A systems approach to talent management is presented in Figure 5.4. It 
includes the major issues of planning, acquiring, developing, managing, and 
retaining employees. These are often subdivided into responsibility areas, as out-
lined in the figure. Traditionally, many of these have been under different sections 
apart from the typical learning and development area of responsibility. However, 
this is a system that must work together in close coordination and integration, 
ideally under the direction of a central person whose key responsibility is talent 
management—­the CHRO. When this is in place, the benefits are tremendous from 
the client’s perspective. First, this approach presents consistent attention through-
out the process. Problems can be spotted quickly and adjustments can be made. 
Second, talent acquisition can be more effective, ensuring that adequate talent is 
recruited and integrated into the system and the appropriate quality and quantities 
are secured. Finally, value is added as costs are reduced when the process is more 
efficient and duplications are avoided. The systems approach is rational and logical; 
it is the economic way to address talent management.

In the traditional model, when a company needs to quickly hire thirty multime-
dia engineers for a new technology deployment, the staffing lead receives notifica-
tion, opens thirty position requisitions, creates an advertisement, posts the job on 
a website, and begins the candidate-­screening process.
In an ideal model, the HR staff would be working closely with the executive team 
and know the business strategy is moving toward multimedia. The HR team could 
scan a database of talent profiles that would identify twenty internal candidates that 
either have multimedia skills or need a few courses/development opportunities to 
acquire the skills. In this case, the request for external talent drops to ten people, 
and the ramp-­up time for the other twenty employees is much shorter. Time to fill 
productivity is reduced. The HR team then works to backfill the jobs that were filled 
by employees who are now in the multimedia jobs. This is a true talent management 
model—­HR deploys resources where they are needed most and develops internal 
talent for optimum performance and long-­term value to the company.
Defining the Critical Talent
Before describing the mechanics of talent management, it is helpful to define the 
critical talent in an organization. Critical talent refers to the employees who drive a 
major part of the company’s business performance and who generate above-­average 
value for customers and shareholders. Typically, the critical talent possess highly 
developed skills and deep knowledge. They don’t just “do their job” but go above and 
beyond to contribute to the organization’s success. Surprisingly, these are not always 
the high-­tech or highest-­paid employees; often, they are the valuable employees that 
are seldom mentioned in the annual report. Take FedEx, for example—­the world’s 
largest overnight package delivery firm. One report suggested that the couriers might 
be more critical to the operation than the pilots who fly the packages through the 
night. The couriers have direct contact with the customers and must make continual 
decisions that impact efficiency and the effectiveness of the supply chain, such as 
how to reconfigure a route and how long to wait for a customer’s packages.10
Critical talent can vary considerably by industry and organization. At Merck, criti-
cal talent may include the scientists and clinicians who discover and develop pharma-
ceuticals that fuel the company’s growth. At ExxonMobil, it may include the geologists 
and petroleum engineers who find and extract oil. At YRC Trucking, the critical talent 
may be the long-­haul truck drivers. At Toyota, the critical talent may be the machinists 
who perform precision operations to develop parts for automobiles using Six Sigma 
standards. At Amazon, the critical talent may be the IT staff who develop and support 
the innovative online marketing. At Wal-­Mart, they may be the inventory managers 
who ensure that the right goods are in the right store at the right time.
Recruiting wars often erupt when there is a shortage of critical talent, leading to 
much inefficiency, cost, and many disruptions along the talent management system.
Competencies: A Starting Point
In recent years, there has been a tremendous focus on the use of competency char-
acteristics and traits of individuals. Some experts indicate that attracting talent 
can only be achieved if it is focused on identifying competencies and using them 
throughout the talent management system. Competency models are fundamental 
to talent management systems. Many organizational units use a unique language 

86	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
when describing recruiting standards, training requirements, and promotional cri-
terion. The problem is exacerbated when organizations span cultures and countries. 
By using an agreed-­upon competency model, the organization can communicate via 
a common language that describes performance from one unit to the next.11
As shown in Figure 5.5, competencies ideally drive the entire talent management 
system. A competency is a reliably measureable, relatively enduring characteristic 
of a person, community, or organization that causes or statistically predicts a crite-
rion or level of performance. Competency characteristics are knowledge, behavioral 
skills, competency processing (IQ), personality traits, values, motives, and occa-
sionally other perceptional capabilities.12 Competencies are a critical part of plan-
ning, recruiting, and selecting talent at the beginning of the process. The processes 
of preparing and developing talent should focus on the same competencies as the 
processes of managing, rewarding, and motivating employees. The competencies 
for a particular job—­even among similar jobs—­can vary.
The key challenge is to determine, to the extent possible, the competencies 
needed for talent in specific divisions, groups, functions, or even job categories and 
use them to drive the talent management system. Some companies use behavior 
dimensions, leadership characteristics, or behavioral quotients instead of compe-
tencies. Whatever the language, it is important that the basis for the talent man-
agement system fit the organization.
Planning for Talent
Planning is perhaps the area that has been most neglected in many talent manage-
ment systems. The objective of planning is to have an orderly process for acquiring

the appropriate types of employees to meet the needs of the organization, given the 
constraints of market forces and the available labor supply. The three areas that are 
often addressed, sometimes by separate individuals or units within the talent man-
agement system, are discussed in the following sections.
Analyzing Talent Needs
Several factors will determine the need for talent, as defined earlier. First, the growth 
of the organization often translates into the largest component of talent requirements. 
The CHRO must be aware of the organization’s strategy, both short-­ and long-­term. 
Needs are sometimes driven by shifts in products and services, acquisitions, mergers, 
and routine growth through expansion. Whatever the reason, growth translates into 
the need for a specific number of individuals in different job categories.
Second, replacement needs are created by employees leaving the organization. 
If turnover is excessive, replacement needs become significant. If there is low turn-
over, replacement needs are minimal. In the context of managing retention, only 
the avoidable turnover is considered. However, when replacements are needed, all 
types of turnover must be considered—­including those individuals who retire, leave 
due to disability, or transfer to other regions. The retirement issue alone is a critical 
problem for many organizations. NASA, for example, faces a tremendous loss of tal-
ent as much of its science and engineering capability will be retiring in the next few 
years.13 This situation will have a tremendous impact on their talent management 
system, which will have to ensure that the proper replacement talent is recruited 
and prepared for their assignments.
Third, changes in skills and competencies translate directly into human capital 
needs. As technology advances, markets change, and products shift, a different set 
of skills and competencies are sometimes needed, either in addition to or beyond 
those currently in the organization. These three issues generate needs that must be 
translated into specific numbers forecasted in both short-­ and long-­term scenarios.
Market Analysis
Since the majority of needs must be filled from the available labor market, a market 
analysis is critical. When examining the labor market, several issues must be taken 
into consideration. First is the supply of labor in the recruiting area—­this is a critical 
issue for some organizations because of labor shortages. This may require the relo-
cation of facilities to ensure a better source of labor. For example, many automobile 
companies based outside the United States are developing plants in record numbers 
in the southern part of the United States. For example, Toyota, Honda, Mercedes 
Benz, and Hyundai have all developed major plants in the state of Alabama, making 
this state the automobile capital of the South. A major part of the attraction is the 
available labor supply—­in both quality and quantity—­as well as a strong work ethic.
Developing Plans
After the needs are determined and the market is analyzed, the plans are devel-
oped, generating a schedule of the number of employees that will be acquired at 
what times from what sources, sometimes by job group. If it becomes apparent 
that the market will not be able to supply the required resources, the shortages 
must be addressed and alternatives developed. For example, due to the difficulty of 

88	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
recruiting fully trained nurses, hospitals have created their own nursing schools, 
sometimes in conjunction with a university. This is a classic case of attempting 
to regulate supply and demand—­taking control of the situation and creating the 
supply. This situation illustrates an important issue that must be part of talent 
planning—­scenario planning. Because all forecasts contain error and there are 
many events that can have a significant effect on the sources of talent, different sce-
narios should be developed, including worst-­case conditions. This process provides 
insight into what can, should, and perhaps must be done to ensure that available 
talent is onboard when needed.
Acquiring Talent
Acquiring talent involves four key issues: attracting, recruiting, selecting, and employ-
ing. Each of these is an important step, often performed by different individuals.
Attracting Talent
Attracting talent is a long-­term issue. The attraction of a workplace comes from 
many factors, but two very important ones relate to the issue of developing the com-
pany into a talent magnet. One factor is being an employer of choice, representing 
a great place to work. The second is the overall reputation, or employment brand, of 
the organization. Employers of choice have several things in common. They organize 
a work–­life balance program that meets needs across the business; they give pro-
fessional and personal development opportunities to all; they enable employees to 
make contributions to the firm tied to personal responsibility; they foster a friendly 
and culturally rich environment; and they operate a business that is responsible to 
the community as a whole.14 In the United States, employer-­of-­choice lists are devel-
oped by a variety of organizations and publications. The most common is Fortune’s 
“100 Best Companies to Work For” in America, described earlier in the chapter.
Organizations are working harder to polish their image in the eyes of prospec-
tive talent. Some have staff who do little but keep the firm’s name in front of both 
faculty and students, promoting their “employer brand.”
Organizational reputation is based on several factors. Harris Interactive and 
the Reputation Institute published a corporate reputation poll based on the views 
of almost thirty thousand respondents.15 They developed six categories to rank 
reputation:
•	 Emotional appeal
•	 Products and services
•	 Workplace environment
•	 Social responsibility
•	 Vision and leadership
•	 Financial performance
Reputations, particularly of workplaces, often evolve and develop over time and 
have to be driven by senior leadership. A few scandals, ethical concerns, or ineffective 
leadership can spoil an otherwise superb reputation. Many companies work very 
hard to ensure that their image, from a talent-­attraction perspective, is superb. In 

Manage Talent for Value

essence, they are attempting to brand their organization as a great place to work as 
well as a great place to invest. Sears perfected this sentiment in their overall strategy 
to create a compelling place to shop, a compelling place to invest, and a compelling 
place to work, putting the customers, shareholders, and employees on equal footing.
Recruiting Talent
Recruiting has changed significantly in the last decade, not only the methods, but 
the overall approach. Table 5.4 shows how the recruiting strategies have shifted.16 
The newer approaches involve constant recruiting, using many sources, branding, 
and involving many individuals. Recruiting strategies are reflecting a comprehen-
sive process with long-­term focus.
Table 5.5 shows the shift in the actual methods of recruiting. Although the tradi-
tional methods are still being used, newer methods are being adopted, particularly 
those involving web resources and networking. Monitoring current events in spe-
cific areas to understand where the talent may be located or what may be driving 
available talent is an effective tactic. Using employees as talent scouts is another 
useful approach. Because of the scarcity and competition for quality talent, a talent 
war is being waged in certain industries. Nontraditional recruiting methods are 
often needed to capture the interest of the passive prospect. Recruiting has become 
so subtle that some organizations—­such as Cisco Systems—­have a philosophy of 
not hiring candidates that are actually looking for a job.
An important development in the recent years is being able to predict success 
with assessments. Sometimes these assessments are used in the selection process 
as candidates are being considered for employment. Others are used internally to 
see who may be high potentials in the organization. The applications are varied and 
almost limitless. Table 5.6 shows some examples of predicting success, taken from 
SHL Talent Measurement, a part of CEB. This organization had tremendous success

with this process, and these examples show a wide variety of evolving possibilities 
for predicting the success of talent in an organization.
Selecting and Employing Talent
Recruiting brings the prospects for consideration. Next comes one of the most 
critical talent decisions—­the employment decision. How it is made, who makes 
it, when it is made, or whether or not it is accepted are important issues. Although 
selection is only one component in the talent management system, it must be con-
sistent. It is at this stage that there is the most scrutiny in terms of being fair and 
equitable. An inconsistent selection process is doomed to be challenged and may 
be difficult to defend. A systematic process should be followed for each selection so 
that no one is subject to disparate treatment and the selection does not represent 
an adverse impact. Figure 5.6 shows the selection system for a commercial banking 
officer for a large banking firm in the United States. The figure shows steps in the

process and where the applicant can be rejected. Because there are so many com-
ponents in a typical selection process, it has to be organized very carefully so that 
the selection time is minimized.

before the ultimate selection is made. After it is made, it becomes expensive, time 
consuming, and disruptive to make adjustments or changes.
Employing talent comprises the processing and administrative steps. Timing 
and convenience are the concerns as new talent joins the organization. All payroll 
tax forms and employee benefits forms need to be completed. An organized system 
is the key to handling these steps efficiently, effectively, and with as little frustration 
as possible. Two important problem areas must be avoided: administrative delays in 
the processing and unpleasant surprises, particularly those that can create a nega-
tive first impression.
Developing Talent
After the new talent is hired, the learning and development process begins with 
on-­boarding, initial training and learning for the job, and development to refine 
processes and improve capability as well as prepare individuals for other job 
positions.
Initial indoctrination and orientation (or on-­boarding, as it is sometimes called) 
creates early impressions that are lasting. It is important for new talent to have a 
positive first day on the job and an outstanding first week. In some job situations, 
where employees have an opportunity to move quickly to another job with little 
investment, an unpleasant experience in the first week of work may result in an 
early turnover. The early turnover measure is the number of departures in the first 
month of employment. When this number is excessive, 10 percent for example, this 
is an indication that either the selections are improper or something is happening 
in the early days of employment to change their opinion.
On-­boarding helps individuals align with the organization and its values, mis-
sion, philosophy, policies, and practices. Employees must understand the rules, 
practices, and policies—­even the unwritten ones—­so that initial success can be 
ensured. It is important to avoid frustrating experiences, missteps, miscues, and 
unpleasant surprises. At the same time, this is the best opportunity to secure 
employee commitment to the organization. Both the motivation and the potential 
for engagement is extremely high. The efficiency and effectiveness of handling the 
orientation are important.
Regardless of the level of talent, a certain amount of preparation for the job is 
necessary. For some, it may be significant, as in preparing for skills or applications 
unique to the job. For most, it will be a matter of adjusting to the situation and 
learning specific practices, technology, and procedures. If the competencies are 
already in place, significant skill building will not be needed. If these competencies 
do not exist, significant training may be required.
A variety of learning and development programs must be available to continue 
to improve performance, refine skills, learn new techniques, and adjust to chang-
ing technology. A variety of development methods should be used, with specific 
emphasis on the nontraditional ones.
Succession management is preparation for the next job. Because today’s employ-
ees are interested in all types of career movement and development opportunities, 
several approaches are utilized and explored. Succession planning is part of this, as 
well as other types of replacement planning.

Manage Talent for Value

Managing Talent
With talent in place and performing, the next challenge is to ensure that perfor-
mance improves and employees are highly motivated and thoroughly utilized. Man-
aging talent involves two new responsibilities of the CHRO: managing performance 
and rewarding talent appropriately.
To ensure that performance is discussed, recognized, rewarded, and understood 
appropriately, many organizations are focusing renewed efforts on performance man-
agement systems. The old approach was the traditional performance review conducted 
quarterly, semiannually, or annually, which was usually a one-­way conversation from a 
manager to an employee. All parties typically disliked the process. Managers did not like 
it because there was the potential for conflict and they did not have the skills or the confi-
dence to do it properly; employees did not like it because it did not meet their needs and 
often left them confused, frustrated, and sometimes angry. The human resources staff 
did not like it either, because it was not conducted properly, effectively, or consistently.
CHROs are attempting to make this process less painful by automating the sys-
tem. For example, a typical approach to performance management is to develop 
briefing sessions and maybe even e-­learning modules that show how the process 
should work and the benefits of conducting these types of discussions. Discussions 
are often more frequent, and there are meetings between the employee and the 
manager to discuss performance improvement and set goals that align with orga-
nizational goals. These goals are entered into an online system, posted for constant 
review, follow-­up, and adjustment. As progress is made, the status is updated. Per-
formance data are available to others who need to keep track of key issues and see 
how well the system is working overall. Progress is monitored and the feedback 
is obtained in a variety of follow-­up discussions. This approach brings constant 
overview, feasible goals, challenging assignments, and alternative delivery, and it 
saves time and provides excellent documentation. Figure 5.7 shows the performance

management system at a large financial services firm. An important challenge for the 
CHRO is to track and manage this type of process so that it becomes a motivational 
tool to drive performance instead of a headache that creates confusion.
Rewarding performance, accomplishments, and milestones is very important. 
If used appropriately, recognition is one of the most effective motivators, and 
another one of the best ways to motivate is to tie bonuses and incentives directly to 
performance. Nonmonetary rewards can often be just as motivational. The devel-
opment of these programs is beyond the scope of this book and can be found in 
many other references.
When providing recognition, both the substance and the style must be consid-
ered. Substance is the value of the reward or recognition from the perspective of the 
person receiving it. If that person places no value on the reward, it will have very 
little motivational effect. The style is the manner in which the recognition is pro-
vided, including how, when, and where. The style relates foremost to the sincerity 
of the communication and is just as important as the substance.
Retaining Talent
Keeping talent on board, the retention process, is perhaps one of the most critical 
challenges for the CHRO, representing one of the newest responsibilities. A strate-
gic accountability approach, outlined in Figure 5.8, is needed to tackle the retention 
issue.18 This approach has five important advantages:
	 1.	 It considers the retention process to be an important part of strategy. The exec-
utive team is very involved in the retention issues.
	 2.	 The retention issues are measured with bottom-­line results. Accountability is 
built in throughout the process so that those involved can fully understand 
the cost of the problem, the cost of the solutions, the potential impact of the 
solutions, and the actual impact of the solutions—­all in monetary terms.
	 3.	 The approach moves logically from one issue to another. A series of steps are 
followed with this approach.
	 4.	 The approach is a discipline and a methodology. With this approach, it is easy 
to stay on track, because each of the different issues has to be addressed before 
moving onto another issue.
	 5.	 It is a continuous cycle of improvement. Starting with a problem ultimately 
leads to a reduction in turnover. The process continues until turnover is at the 
desired level.
Ultimately, the approach positions the organization in a preventative stance, 
working to maintain the appropriate level of staffing and reduce the risk of turnover. 
Each segment of the strategic accountability approach is briefly discussed in the 
remainder of the chapter.
Measure and Monitor Turnover
For many organizations, turnover is defined solely as voluntary. For others, resig-
nations and terminations based on unsatisfactory performance are included in the 
definition. The cleanest definition to use is avoidable turnover—­employees leaving 

Manage Talent for Value
95
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
(voluntarily) or being forced to leave (involuntarily) when such departures could 
have been prevented. It is important for the classification to match the definition in 
benchmarking studies, industry reports, or trade publications. Turnover by demo-
graphics should be reported, showing the regions, divisions, and branches as well 
as the sex, age, and personal characteristics of the individual employees. Job groups 
are also important.
When using benchmark data and other comparisons, trigger points for action 
must be developed. When should an alarm sound? Is it a rising trend or a sudden 
spurt? Is the measure going up when it should go down? Each of these could signal 
that it is necessary to begin exploring causes and creating solutions.
Develop the Fully Loaded Cost of Turnover
The impact cost of turnover is one of the most underestimated and undervalued 
costs in organizations. It is often misunderstood because it does not reflect the

loaded cost of turnover, detailed in Table 5.3, should be reported even if it is only 
an estimate. The total cost will attract the attention of the senior management team, 
revealing the true impact that turnover is having in the organization.
Identify Causes of Turnover and Needs for Retention Improvement
The causes of turnover must be determined. Some causes appear obvious, whereas 
others can be deceptive. Collecting appropriate data is often a challenge because 
of the potential for bias and inaccuracies that surface during the data collection 
process. Several diagnostic processes are available. A variety of tools are available 
for use with turnover analysis, beginning with analyzing trends and patterns in 
particular groups and demographic categories to pinpoint the problem area. As 
Table 5.8 lists, the tools range from conducting a survey to coordinating a focus 
group to uncover the causes of turnover.
Explore a Range of Solutions and Match Solutions to Needs
Creative approaches to the turnover problem have resulted in hundreds of excellent 
solutions. In fact, because there are so many potential solutions to the problem, 
confusion often results. The solution must be appropriate and feasible for the orga-
nization. When matching solutions to needs, five key recommendations should be 
considered:
	 1.	 Avoid mismatches.
	 2.	 Discourage multiple solutions.
	 3.	 Select a solution for maximum return.
	 4.	 Verify the match early.
	 5.	 Check the progress of each solution.
Forecast the Value of Solutions
Forecasting is an expert estimation of what a solution should contribute, and the 
process can be difficult, challenging, and risky. When a forecast for the value of 
a solution is developed, this allows the team to establish priorities, work with a

minimum number of solutions, and focus on solutions with the greatest ROI. When 
as much data as possible is accumulated, the estimate is supported and credibility 
is built around the process. The payoff value can be developed if the percentage of 
expected turnover reduction can be related to it.
Ideally, the forecast should contain an expected ROI value, particularly if the 
solution is expensive. However, a more realistic approach is to offer a range of pos-
sible ROI values, given certain assumptions, which removes some of the risk of 
making a precise estimation. This step is perhaps one of the most difficult parts of 
the process.
Calculate ROI for Turnover Reduction Solutions
Another commonly neglected step is the calculation of the impact of a turnover 
reduction strategy. This step is often omitted because it appears to be an unneces-
sary add-­on process. If accumulating solutions is the measure of success of turnover 
reduction or prevention, the impact to those solutions may appear to have no value. 
However, from a senior executive’s point of view, accountability is not complete 
until impact and ROI data have been collected, at least for major solutions.
Make Adjustments and Continue
The extensive set of data collected from the ROI process will provide information 
that can be used to make adjustments in turnover reduction strategies. The infor-
mation reveals success of the turnover reduction solution at all levels, from reaction 
to ROI. It also examines barriers to success, identifying specifically what kept the 
solution from being effective or prevented it from becoming more effective. This 
information also identifies the processes in place that enable or support a turnover 
reduction solution. All the information provides a framework for adjusting the solu-
tion so that it can be revised, discontinued, or amplified. The next step in the process 
goes back to the beginning—­monitoring the data to ensure that turnover continues 
to meet expectations—­and then the cycle continues.
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
Talent management is a critical force for any type of organization. It makes a dif-
ference in the success or failure of most organizations. In the current economic 
climate, critical talent is in demand. We are in a war for talent, and an organization 
must find ways to acquire the best talent and develop critical talent internally as 
well. This is an important part of the human capital strategy, which must address 
the following issues:
•	 Developing a talent management system
•	 Defining critical talent
•	 Assigning responsibilities for talent management
•	 Implementing measurement systems to understand how the system is working
•	 Adjusting the system as needed

here is probably no other topic more frequently discussed in the human 
resources area than employee engagement. Articles, conferences, and books 
are filled with issues about employee engagement, usually for good reason. Fully 
engaged employees will remain with their organization, produce more, have bet-
ter quality, and be more efficient. In addition, they will satisfy customers and 
increase sales. This is achieved by examining not only the why, what, and how of 
the work but also where and when the work is done, addressing alternative and 
flexible work systems and workspace design. When these issues are addressed 
properly, they can foster a long-­lasting, high-­performing work team. This chapter 
explores a variety of issues about employee engagement, how to make it success-
ful, and how to know when it is successful. It also discusses different arrange-
ments for alternative and flexible work systems and how to make them work—­all 
leading toward a particular set of strategies for these issues.
Force 4: Employee Engagement. Employee engagement is an 
issue that attracts a tremendous amount of management atten-
tion and many resources. The challenge is to make sure employ-
ees are actively engaged in their work so that productivity is 
enhanced, quality is increased, and they stay with the organiza-
tion. This involves not only the nature of the work itself but the 
why of the work and the how of the work. This focuses on 
the different projects and processes designed to improve job 
engagement. It also involves where and when the work is accom-
plished. There is a trend toward more alternative work solutions, 
including allowing employees to work at home in many settings. 
There is also a push to allow employees to adjust their hours, so 
they determine when to complete their work. Finally, the design 
of the workspace makes a difference in employee performance. 
All these issues need to be addressed in the human capital strat-
egy so that employee performance is maximized.

Opening Story: Quicken Loans
Quicken Loans is a banking and credit services company with $3.6 billion in annual 
revenue. Founded in 1985 in Detroit, Quicken Loans has nearly twelve thousand 
employees. At Quicken Loans, employee engagement is not a process, a depart-
ment, or survey. Engagement is part of the business strategy and culture of this 
intentionally flat organization. Every employee (called a “team member”), from 
new hires to CEO Bill Emerson, is responsible for identifying problems and creating 
and implementing solutions, and team member engagement is evident from its 
twelfth-­place ranking in Fortune’s 2015 list of the “100 Best Companies to Work For.”1
The Quicken Loans “ISMs” book is a physical embodiment of team member 
engagement at the company. ISMs are simple, easy-­to-­digest principles that form 
every business decision at Quicken Loans. The book has a pop-­art look and details 
what is and is not accepted at Quicken Loans, a reminder of the lessons learned 
from day one: the expectations for empowered team members to not wait for a form 
or a process, to do what needs doing, fix what needs fixing, and call every customer 
back, every time, no excuses.
ISMs are written in simple and accessible language, and the ISMs book is 
updated continually. The spring 2015 edition includes this list:
•	 Always raising our level of awareness.
•	 The inches we need are everywhere around us.
•	 Responding with a sense of urgency is the ante to play.
•	 Every client. Every time. No exception. No excuses.
•	 Obsessed with finding a better way.
•	 Ignore the noise.
•	 It’s not about WHO is right, but WHAT is right.
•	 We are the “they.”
•	 You have to take the roast out of the oven.
•	 You will see it when you believe it.
•	 We will figure it out.
•	 Numbers and money follow, they do not lead.
•	 A penny saved is a penny.
•	 We eat our own dog food.
•	 Simplicity is genius.
•	 Innovation is rewarded. Execution is worshipped.
•	 Do the right thing.
•	 Every second counts.
•	 Yes before no.2
Employee onboarding is a cornerstone of the culture. Programs host 100 to 400 
new team members at a time for an eight-­hour session with CEO Bill Emerson and 
Chairman Dan Gilbert on the ISMs. The ISMs book is distributed, along with Emer-
son’s email address and phone number, to new team members.
All other talent management practices are based directly or indirectly on the 
ISMs, including career development, performance management, training and 
development, leadership development, and succession management.

There are no formal engagement surveys. Instead, leaders have regular sessions 
with their teams to ask what can be done to help them work more productively and 
be more satisfied with their work and the company.
The workspaces look deceptively whimsical. At first glance, for instance, the cus-
tomer service area looks like colorful chaos. But the ceilings and dividers are func-
tional, diluting background noise so each customer feels as if he or she is talking 
to a person, not a call center. The basement copy room, in which the main job is 
the logistics of shifting paper—­a high-­volume product for a mortgage company— 
­is light and airy. The ceiling fixtures are playful representations of paper, and natural 
light is funneled from the street. Team members know that they are key parts of the 
“mortgage machine” that drives company profits, not just workers in the mundane 
world of paper supplies.
Elements of fun and functionality are integrated, promoting collaboration and 
teamwork and ensuring that safety and physical comfort are met so that team mem-
bers can focus on clients. Venues for relaxation and leisure help team members 
regain focus. The company also offers team members free snacks, benefits such 
as pet insurance, and at the Detroit headquarters, on-­site amenities from child 
care to Zumba classes. The philosophy is that while the company’s purpose is not 
popcorn and slushy frozen treat machines in the break room, those things help the 
company achieve its purpose, because giving team members both concierge service 
and a sense of fun quickly transfers to customer service. Team members know what 
customer service is because they receive it themselves.3
The Shifting Nature of Work
When you look into any kind of organization, you can see that the nature of work 
has changed. In some organizations, it has changed dramatically, particularly for 
knowledge workers in office spaces. This change in work involves the work itself, 
the meaning of work, and how it is accomplished, including the place, time, and 
environment in which it is accomplished. This shift is illustrated in Figure 6.1 as 
the drastic differences between employee behaviors of the past the future. Many of 
these changes focus on engagement, having an employee who is more connected 
to the organization, and that feeling of belonging and ownership translates into 
more effort, more productivity, and more success for both the individual and the 
organization. Many of the issues in this figure are described in this chapter, and 
some are captured in later chapters, such as the changes in technology.4 They all 
represent important opportunities for change and improvement, and they reflect 
excellent topics to be addressed in the human capital strategy.
Employee Engagement Is the Critical Difference
We’ve seen the headlines from newspapers in the developed economies of the 
United States and Europe about anemic economic growth, massive layoffs, scarce 
job openings, and worker disillusionment due to the demise of the “employee con-
tract.” For those still working, they often find a working environment characterized 
by company instability, frequent management turnover, reductions in health bene-
fits, reduction or elimination of pension contributions, and high levels of stress that 

102	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
result from either the fear of losing a job or having to shoulder the burden of addi-
tional work left by departed coworkers. For those who do find a new job after long-­
term unemployment, they are often overqualified, underutilized, or hired at lower 
compensation levels because it is a buyer’s market. In rapidly growing, emerging 
markets, the abundance of low-­skilled workers often means a booming economy 
built on the backs of laborers in modern-­day sweatshops and factories, sometimes 
with disastrous workplace tragedies. Over the past few years in the hotter job mar-
kets (and tighter talent pools) in parts of Asia, many employees jump from one job 
to another in order to move quickly up their personal title and salary ladder with 
little commitment to a company, its customers, or its mission.
Against that backdrop, it’s hard to believe that any company, anywhere, has the 
kind of employee population that can make it successful, given the challenging econo-
mies, increasing pressures from new competitors, rising pace of technological change, 
increasing government regulation, and heightened geopolitical risk. Yet there are com-
panies who outperform their industry peers even when so many of the products, ser-
vices, structures, and challenges are surprisingly similar. These companies excel at a 
variety of business metrics from shareholder value, to operating margin, to workplace 
safety. They are more likely to be innovative. They have stronger employee value prop-
ositions to retain key employees and a compelling brand to attract new talent.

What makes this critical difference? Many would argue, as would we, that the 
difference is an engaged workforce, which consistently delivers superior perfor-
mance, creates innovative products and solutions, and serves as brand ambassa-
dors to both drive customer loyalty as well as attract great candidates. But how can 
companies stem the tide of worker malaise and distrust? What can companies do to 
drive high levels of employee engagement? How can organizations build a culture 
of engagement that fosters the kind of employee performance that can make the 
difference between survival and success? And even more important, how do they 
measure the impact so that they know whether they are successful?
The focus of this chapter is on employee engagement programs and initiatives 
at the organizational or business unit level. This begins with an examination of the 
macro level of employee engagement: what employee engagement is, the factors 
the drive (or hinder) engaged workforces, the evolution of the concept of engage-
ment, the state of engagement and engagement practices today, and thoughts on 
building a culture of engagement.
The Drivers of Engagement
There is a great deal of alignment in numerous studies about the drivers (factors 
that have significant influence) of engagement, which usually reflect aspects of the 
business culture, relationships with supervisors, and workload. Among the more 
well-­known assessments of engagement drivers are the following:
Towers Watson’s 2012 Global Workforce Study lists these five priority areas of 
focus and the behaviors and actions that matter to employees:
•	 Leadership (is effective at growing the business; shows sincere interest in 
employees’ well-­being; behaves consistently with the organization’s core val-
ues; earns employees’ trust and confidence)
•	 Stress, balance, and workload (manageable stress levels at work; a healthy bal-
ance between work and personal life; enough employees in the group to do the 
job right; flexible work arrangements)
•	 Goals and objectives (employees understand the organization’s business goals, 
steps they need to take to reach those goals, and how their job contributes to 
achieving goals)
•	 Supervisors (assign tasks suitable to employees’ skills; act in ways consistent 
with their words; coach employees to improve performance; treat employees 
with respect)
•	 Organization’s image (highly regarded by the general public; displays honesty 
and integrity in business activities)5
The Merit Principles Survey, which is administered to more than thirty-­six thou-
sand workers by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, asks questions to elicit 
information about these drivers:
•	 Pride in one’s work or workplace
•	 Satisfaction with leadership
•	 Opportunity to perform well at work

104	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Satisfaction with recognition received
•	 Prospect for future personal and professional growth
•	 A positive work environment with some focus on teamwork6
Research from The Conference Board revealed these eight drivers of engage-
ment to be key:
•	 Trust and integrity
•	 Nature of the job
•	 Line of sight between individual performance and company performance
•	 Career growth opportunities
•	 Pride about the company
•	 Coworkers/team members
•	 Employee development
•	 Personal relationship with one’s manager7
Drivers of engagement have been relatively consistent over time; however, there 
are now more frequent mentions of both recognition and the desire to do meaning-
ful work (aligning with the mission of the organization).
Stages of Engagement
Engagement science has been evolving for some time, and it has already had a major 
impact in organizations in terms of what they do and their success. But there is a 
lot more potential for the future. It is through human capital strategy that addi-
tional efforts will be made in this important area. It is helpful to review the status 
of engagement through the stages of its development—­first, with research pin-
pointing how it arrived and morphed into a powerful topic in almost every human 
resources function. Next, the status of engagement as a process and a practice is 
underscored. Finally, its impact, the value of engagement in terms of what is being 
reported now, is covered.
Research
From its humble origins as research about “employee motivation” in the mid-­1950s, 
predominantly among companies in the United States, to “job satisfaction,” to 
“employee commitment,” and finally to the current concept of “employee engage-
ment,” these attempts have sought to link worker attitudes to productivity with 
the belief (even in the absence of definitive proof) that engaged workers are more 
productive and valuable than those who are not.
Management theory, including the early work of Mary Parker Follett in the 
1920s, has long sought to understand the ways in which organizational structure 
and management practice can impact employee behavior, resulting in improved 
business performance. In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers like Frederick Herz-
berg studied employee motivation and the elements of the workplace that drove 
either satisfaction or dissatisfaction, concluding that these elements are often very 
different things.8 Perhaps the most important pioneer in terms of engagement is 
Scott Myers, who integrated the research of many people, including Rensis Likert, 

Engage Employees at Work
105
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Douglas McGregor, David McClelland, Abraham Maslow, Chris Argyris, and Fred-
rick Hertzberg. Combining all this research and making sense of it in terms of its 
implications for employees and their work, Myers published a book in 1970 to name 
and explain the concept he developed: Every Employee a Manager.9 In his work, 
Myers showed how each employee can and should manage their work to a certain 
extent, with some obvious limitations. For the most part, jobs can be managed by 
individuals so they feel ownership and responsibility for their work, the ultimate 
form of engagement. Myers was able to make it understandable and put it into 
practice as he worked with many executives, bringing this concept to job design and 
supervisory practices as well as human resources programs.
Job satisfaction surveys elicit information about the way employees feel about 
their work environment, compensation, company benefits, and management, 
among other aspects of their workplace. Examinations of the concept of job satisfac-
tion began to appear in the academic literature in the mid-­1960s, notably The Mea-
sure of Satisfaction in Work and Retirement: A Strategy for the Study of Attitudes.10
Rates of job satisfaction in the United States have suffered for a variety of rea-
sons, including the erosion of employee loyalty in the 1980s when pension plans 
changed and off-­shoring, layoffs, and plant closures shattered what had become 
an employee expectation of stable, long-­term employment. As part of one of the 
longest-­running examinations of job satisfaction in the United States, The Confer-
ence Board’s latest annual study reveals that less than half (47.3 percent) of U.S. 
workers say that they are satisfied with their jobs, compared to the 61.1 percent in 
1987, the first year of analysis. This reflects a steady decline in job satisfaction over 
the decades, which only recently returned to pre–­Great Recession levels after hitting 
its lowest point in 2010 at 42.6 percent.11 However, while these concepts are related, 
job satisfaction is not the same as engagement.
Academic research specifically regarding employee engagement began to 
appear in the early 1990s. Even then, research posited that engaged and disen-
gaged workers offer varying degrees of “effort” and are, at various times, more 
or less committed to the work and the workplace, as explained in “Psychological 
Conditions of Personal Engagement and Disengagement at Work.”12 This more 
esoteric academic work continued to explore the ways in which employees feel (or 
fail to feel) connected to the workplace.
The 2002 Journal of Applied Psychology article “Business-­Unit-­Level Relationship 
between Employee Satisfaction, Employee Engagement, and Business Outcomes: A 
Meta-­Analysis”13 was among the very first attempts to quantify engagement in terms 
of business results, and business leaders finally took notice, causing a dramatic shift 
in the level of attention paid to, and investments in, employee engagement.
Practice
Despite all the energy, effort, and resources (financial and otherwise) devoted to 
the issue of employee engagement for decades, the overall level of engagement 
in the workforce remains low and largely unchanged even in the face of the ongoing 
global recession. A research report called The State of the Global Workplace reveals 
that only 13 percent of workers are engaged, 63 percent are not engaged, and 24 per-
cent are actively disengaged. There are, of course, regional differences, ranging from 
workers in East Asia (largely China) being among the least engaged, at 6 percent, 

106	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
to workers in New Zealand and Australia, where 24 percent of workers are engaged 
and only 16 percent are actively disengaged. The highest levels of active disengage-
ment in the world can be found in the Middle East and North Africa.14 In the United 
States, among its nearly one hundred million full-­time employees, 30 percent are 
engaged, 50 percent are not engaged, and 20 percent are actively disengaged.15
Engagement rates, of course, differ by region, country, and state; by occupation; 
by gender; by seniority level; by remote versus on-­site location; by educational 
level; and by age. When organizations can determine levels of engagement on 
a granular level (by business unit or division, by employee population or team 
leader) then a clearer picture emerges from the data as to the relative performance 
of the groups against their peers. It is only when that data becomes actionable for 
the short term or even predictive for the long term that employee engagement data 
has any real value.
Among the most common issues that surface in employee engagement surveys 
are poor management/leadership, a lack of career opportunities or limited pro-
fessional growth, a disconnect from the mission or strategy of the organization, a 
negative perception of the organization’s future, and an unmanageable workload.16
In 2012, The Conference Board surveyed engagement leaders at 209 companies 
in twenty-­one countries to determine, among other things, what engagement prac-
tices, programs, and initiatives are most prevalent. Employee Engagement—­What 
Works Now? reported these findings:
•	 The engagement function reports to the CHRO 52 percent of the time and to 
another senior HR executive 27 percent of the time, making this clearly a pro-
cess still owned by human resources.
•	 Eighty-­nine percent of surveyed human capital practitioners said that they 
have an engagement strategy in place.
•	 Fifty-­two percent report that their organizations have been focused on engage-
ment for more than five years.
•	 Sixty percent work with an external vendor and 16 percent work with a consult-
ing firm to develop survey questions.
•	 Forty-­one percent administer an annual survey and 27 percent administer one 
biannually, while 25 percent survey more frequently, leaving 7 percent who do 
not survey at all.
•	 Eighty-­four percent indicated that their company’s approach to employee 
engagement strategy has changed in the last six to twenty-­four months, either 
greatly (26 percent) or somewhat (58 percent), with many indicating that the 
change was a matter of “more focus” on engagement or increased accountability.
•	 Companies are using surveys to measure not only engagement but also leader-
ship behaviors (66 percent), job satisfaction (63 percent), and organizational 
culture (60 percent).
•	 Only 49 percent of organizations link employee performance and results to 
engagement.
•	 Despite the importance of engagement, 48 percent said that they had no one 
dedicated full-­time to engagement activities, and another 29 percent indicated 
that they had only one to three full-­time employees dedicated to administering, 
monitoring, and analyzing these programs.17

Value
Employee engagement is critical to business performance and a success factor on 
many levels, from executing business strategy, to financial performance, to worker 
productivity, to the ability to create innovative products and services. In a recent 
annual study in which more than one thousand CEOs, presidents, and chairmen 
listed their most critical areas of concern for the coming year as well as the strategies 
they plan to use to address these challenges, it was revealed that, on a global basis, 
human capital issues are the top challenge, first-­ or second-­ranked in every region, 
including China and India.18
Continuing its steady rise in the ranking of strategies to address the human cap-
ital challenge, “raise employee engagement” ranked second in 2014, up from third in 
the 2013 survey and eighth in the 2012 survey. In addition, respondents indicated the 
critical linkage between “Human Capital” and their next four challenges: “Customer 
Relationships,” “Innovation,” “Operational Excellence,” and “Corporate Brand and 
Reputation.” In fact, engagement is also a top-­five strategy to address the challenges 
of Innovation and Operational Excellence. Respondents in this survey have clearly 
put employees at the center of everything.
One of the most comprehensive studies showing the business impact of 
employee engagement, The Relationship Between Engagement at Work and Orga-
nizational Outcomes, reveals that engagement is indeed related to the nine per-
formance outcomes selected for the study, with consistent correlations across 
organizations. Among the other findings are the following:
•	 Business/work units scoring in the top half on employee engagement nearly 
double their odds of success compared with those in the bottom half.
•	 Those at the ninety-­ninth percentile have four times the success rate as those 
at the first percentile.
•	 Median differences between top-­quartile and bottom-­quartile units were 10 
percent in customer ratings, 22 percent in profitability, 21 percent in produc-
tivity, 25 percent in turnover (for high-­turnover organizations), 65 percent in 
turnover (for low-­turnover organizations), 48 percent in safety incidents, 28 
percent in shrinkage (theft), 37 percent in absenteeism, 41 percent in patient 
safety incidents, and 41 percent in quality (defects).19
A longitudinal study of market performance, Employee Engagement and Earn-
ings per Share: A Longitudinal Study of Organizational Performance During the 
Recession, reveals a correlation between earnings per share and employee engage-
ment levels, finding that those organizations with the most engaged workers 
exceeded the earnings per share of their competition (even widening their lead 
during the recession) by 72 percent.20
These findings regarding superior earnings per share (EPS) are underscored in 
Gallup’s latest State of the Global Workplace, which states that engaged employees 
worldwide are almost more than twice as likely to report that their organizations 
are hiring (versus disengaged employees) and that “organizations with an average 
of 9.3 engaged workers for every actively disengaged employee in 2010–­2011 expe-
rienced 147 percent higher EPS compared with their competition in 2011–­2012. In 

108	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
contrast, those with an average of 2.6 engaged employees for every actively disen-
gaged employee experienced 2 percent lower EPS compared with their competition 
during the same period.”21
The linkage between employee engagement and business metrics can also be 
found in Towers Watson’s Global Workforce Study:
•	 Higher levels of engagement can translate into higher operating margins, from 
just below 10 percent for companies with low “traditional” engagement levels, to 
just over 14 percent for those with high “traditional” engagement, to more than  
27 percent for those with high “sustainable” engagement (defined by the “inten-
sity” of employees’ connection to their organization based on three core ele-
ments: being engaged, feeling enabled, and feeling energized).
•	 Highly engaged workers have lower rates of “presenteeism” (lost productivity 
at work at only 7.6 days/year versus 14.1 days/year) and “absenteeism” than 
disengaged workers (at 3.2 days/year versus 4.2 days/year).
•	 Highly engaged workers are less likely to report an intention to leave their 
employers within the next two years (18 percent) versus the highly disengaged 
(40 percent), and 72 percent of the highly engaged also indicated that they 
would prefer to remain with their employer even if offered a comparable posi-
tion elsewhere.22
A Watson Wyatt study, Using Continual Engagement to Drive Business Results, 
found “striking” differences in the performance of high-­engagement workers and 
low-­engagement workers: the highly engaged are 79 percent more likely to be top 
performers.23
Great Place to Work, a consulting and research firm, has studied engagement 
in the workplace for decades and includes trust as part of its model. Companies 
selected for inclusion on the “Great Places to Work” list, in partnership with For-
tune magazine, exhibit a higher degree of trust and engagement in the workplace 
than other companies. Great Place to Work articulates these benefits of trust and 
engagement in the workplace:
•	 Committed and engaged employees who trust their management perform 20 
percent better and are 87 percent less likely to leave an organization, resulting 
in easier employee and management recruitment, decreased training costs, and 
incalculable value in retained tenure equity.
•	 Analysts indicate that publicly traded companies on the “100 Best Companies 
to Work For” list consistently outperform major stock indices by 300 percent 
and have half the voluntary turnover rates of their competitors.24
We live in an age where maintaining an organization’s reputation and brand is 
a constant challenge, especially as organizations seek to retain current customers 
and attract new ones. Frontline employees are the key to success with customers. 
Numerous studies point to the importance of employee engagement on customer 
satisfaction, as listed in the Employee Engagement in a VUCA World report from The 
Conference Board. For example, research indicates that the customers of engaged 
employees use their products more, which leads to higher levels of customer

satisfaction, and that these employees influence the behavior and attitudes of their 
customers, which drives profitability.25
The subject of a Harvard Business School case study and later author of a best-
selling business book, Employees First, Customers Second, Vineet Nayar, had a then 
radical philosophy when he was vice chairman and CEO of India-­based HCL Tech-
nologies: focus first on employees and make management accountable to them, 
as that will result in higher levels of engagement and effectiveness, making for 
stronger customer relationships.26
Engagement (or lack thereof) can also be measured in terms of economic impact 
with wide-­ranging implications for countries and regions. While few employees are 
engaged and many more are not engaged, companies would do well to take action to 
mitigate the impact of the actively disengaged. Gallup estimates that economic loss 
from active disengagement costs the United States between $450 and $550 billion 
per year. In Germany, that figure ranges from €112 to €138 billion per year (US$151 
to $186 billion). In the United Kingdom, actively disengaged employees cost the 
country between £52 and £70 billion (US$83 billion and $112 billion) per year.27
In addition to determining the impact on business performance, human capital 
programs and initiatives also rely on employee engagement data. According to a report 
by Bersin, 57 percent of HR practitioners indicated that the employee engagement 
metric was their most important in terms of determining talent management success.28
A Model for Implementation
It is helpful to understand engagement from the perspective of how it is introduced 
and implemented in an organization. The implementation usually follows several 
prescribed steps, and there are many different approaches offered in terms of how 
engagement is delivered. Using the focus on delivering value, we have adopted a 
model that brings engagement into the organization with a constant focus on the 
business contribution of the engagement process.
Figure 6.2 shows the nine-­step engagement model covered in this chapter. As 
with most important processes, engagement starts with alignment to the business 
in the beginning and ends with measuring the impact on the business in a very 
logical, rational way. It is also presented in a cyclical fashion to show that this is 
a never-­ending adjustment process, always collecting data to see how things are 
working and making adjustments when they are not. The next nine sections provide 
more detail on this model.
Align Employee Engagement to the Business
The beginning point with any process is alignment to the business, and engagement 
should be no different. Business needs and business value is the beginning point that 
executives want to see. This is expressed through classic measures in the system, usually 
reflecting output, quality, cost, and time. These critical data are reported throughout 
the system in scorecards, dashboards, key performance indicators, operating reports, 
and many other vehicles. A new HR program or human capital initiative should begin 
with the end in mind, focusing on one of those business measures, such as productiv-
ity, sales, customer satisfaction, employee retention, quality, cycle times, and so forth.

110	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy

The challenge is to identify those measures that should change if employees 
are more actively engaged. The literature is full of hypotheses on these issues, all 
claiming a variety of results. This quick review can help management understand 
what might come out of this. The important point is that if a measure is identified, 
it is more likely that the engagement process will actually achieve its goal. Beginning 
with the end in mind is the best driver for the outcomes of the process.
Employee engagement scores, taken either annually or biannually, are impact 
data, because they indicate the collective impact of all the engagement processes 
in the organization. These data only describe perceptions, but they are still very 
important. Engagement, on its own, is an intangible measure in the scheme of 
impact measures. Unfortunately, many organizations early in the process stop 
there, merely reporting improvements in engagement scores. This leads many exec-
utives to respond, “So what?” So we have to do more, and doing more means that the 
results of engagement must be identified at the macro and micro levels.
The business impact is the linkage of engagement with certain outcome mea-
sures in the business category. The efforts of the HR team should be to illustrate the 
Figure 6.2.  Engagement model.

Engage Employees at Work
111

significant correlation and causation between improvements in engagement scores 
and outcome measures, which can typically be expressed in statements such as the 
following:
•	 Engagement drives productivity.
•	 Engagement drives quality.
•	 Engagement drives sales.
•	 Engagement drives retention.
•	 Engagement drives safety.
Others have developed more specific measures to link to engagement, such as 
processing times for loans to be underwritten, purchase cost for the procurement 
function, or security breaches in the IT function. The point is that engagement scores 
can be linked to many outcomes, and the HR function’s challenge is to show that.
Another way to show the business value of engagement is to connect it to 
individual projects. In this case, it is not just the overall engagement score that is 
linked to the business measures from a macro prospective but also an individual 
project involving individual participants. For example, a leadership development 
program for IAMGOLD, a large gold mining organization, was developed as a result 
of low engagement scores. After the program was implemented, which involved 
almost one thousand managers and cost the company $6 million, not only was the 
engagement score monitored for improvement, but individual measures that were 
selected by the participants were also linked directly to the leadership program.29 
The leadership program actually challenged the first level of management to get 
employees more engaged and to focus their efforts on improving two measures that 
each participant supervisor in the program selected. As these measures changed, 
the effects of the program were isolated from other influences, converted to mone-
tary value, and compared to the cost of the program. This yielded a 46 percent ROI 
in this important job group. In another example, a manufacturing plant used job 
engagement to improve quality of work, and the study tracking the success of the 
program examined improvements in quality, converted them to a monetary value, 
and then compared it to the cost of the program to yield a ROI of 399 percent.30
Define and Explain Employee Engagement
While there are many definitions of employee engagement, they are remarkably 
similar in their emphasis on several common elements. The following come from a 
review of engagement definitions found in Employee Engagement in a VUCA World:
•	 According to The Conference Board, “Employee engagement is a heightened 
emotional and intellectual connection that an employee has for his/her job, 
organization, manager, or co-­workers that, in turn, influences him/her to apply 
additional discretionary effort to his/her work.”
•	 Towers Watson delineated employee engagement along three dimensions:
o	 Rational. How well employees understand their roles and responsibilities.
o	 Emotional. How much passion they bring to the work and their 
organizations.

112	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
o	 Motivational. How willing they are to invest discretionary effort to perform 
roles well.
•	 The independent, quasi-­judicial agency in the executive branch of the U.S. gov-
ernment, the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, states, “Employee engage-
ment is a heightened connection between employees and their work, their 
organization, or the people they work for or with.”
•	 According to management consultancy and executive search firm Korn Ferry, 
“Employee engagement is a mindset in which employees take personal stake-
holder responsibility for the success of the organization and apply discretionary 
efforts aligned with its goals.”31
These definitions suggest both alignment with the organization as well as the 
willingness to expend discretionary effort as critical components of employee 
engagement. Further, the Gallup Organization delineates three types of employees 
as follows:
•	 Engaged employees work with passion and feel a profound connection to their 
company. They drive innovation and move the organization forward.
•	 Not-­engaged employees are essentially “checked out.” They’re sleepwalking 
through their workday, putting time—­but not energy or passion—­into their 
work.
•	 Actively disengaged employees aren’t just unhappy at work; they’re busy acting 
out their unhappiness. Every day, these workers undermine what their engaged 
coworkers accomplish.32
Of note, one of the more recent developments in this space has been a focus on 
“well-­being,” which links engagement to health issues as part of a movement toward 
holistic work environments. Another development is a focus on “happiness,” which 
seeks a holistic approach to worker contentment by weighing two components: 
overall life satisfaction and affect balance. (For an overview of this concept as well 
as profiles of examinations of happiness at Zappos, Google, HCL, Best Buy, and 
Southwest Airlines, please see The Happiness Premium: What Companies Should 
Know About Leveraging Happiness in the Workplace.)33
Executives must communicate not only what engagement means but how it affects 
them and how their role will change. This part of this step in the model is very critical, 
because it connects the executives to the process and fully explains what is involved. 
Some of this may involve stories that are told about what it means to be engaged. 
For example, there is the classic story of the janitor at NASA who was asked, “What 
is your job?” while he was sweeping the floors. He answered that he was helping 
put a man on the moon. Although this may appear to be an odd example, this is 
the kind of thinking and attitude that is sought through the engagement process. 
Stories, memos, meetings, speeches, and even formal documents can help define 
and explain the goal of the process.
Implement Policies and Programs to Drive Engagement
The next part of the process is to enact the different formal processes that will 
address the engagement issue.

Engage Employees at Work
113
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
The starting point is to show the mission, vision, and values of the organiza-
tion. These are well-­documented in most organizations, but the key is to integrate 
some language around engagement. For example, here is what Tony Hsieh, CEO of 
Zappos.com, says about engagement:
We have 10 core values, and when we hire people, we make sure they have 
similar values. For example, one of our values is to be humble. If someone 
comes in and is really egotistical, even if they are the greatest, most talented 
person technically and we know they could do a lot for our top or bottom line, 
we won’t hire them, because they are not a culture fit.34
After engagement is clearly defined and the dimensions of work that connect 
with the definition are clearly described, a survey is usually developed that secures 
the perception from employees. This is an initial survey to reveal the current status 
of engagement, and the survey data are used to make improvements. This is a classic 
survey-­feedback-­action loop that many organizations use as they survey employees, 
provide feedback to the survey respondents, and plan actions during the year to 
improve engagement. This is not only a routine, formal practice; it becomes the 
principal process improvement tool as changes and adjustments are made each year 
based on the engagement survey results.
Engagement is usually a principle component or determinate of a “Great Place 
to Work.” There are many Great Place to Work programs, ranging from the most 
well-­known, Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For,” to those of a particular 
professional field, locale, or specialty (such as diversity). For example, in Fortune’s 
“100 Best Companies to Work For,” two-­thirds of the determinate for being on the 
list is the score of an engagement survey given to a randomly selected sample of 
employees. This is very powerful data, and a positive score is desired by the exec-
utive team as they build a great place to work. Being included on such a list helps 
attract and retain employees, and although the award itself is an intangible, it is 
obviously connected to tangible measures, as discussed earlier.
Among HR functions, specific adjustments can be made to improve various 
components of engagement. For example, recruiting and selection processes can 
include letting potential audiences know about the organization’s efforts to have 
employees fully engaged. Selection may be based on the desire of employees to be 
engaged in the organization, and more emphasis may be given to on-­boarding as a 
process of aligning people with the philosophy of the organization.
The training and learning programs can be developed to reinforce the principles 
of engagement; even the method of learning is sometimes adjusted to be more 
adaptive to the individuals in organizations. Ideally, training is perceived as just in 
time, just enough, and just for me. That means it is customized for individuals and 
provided at the time they need it.
Compensation can be adjusted to reward individuals for being more engaged. 
Since engagement often leads to improved financial outcomes, sometimes this 
means paying for bonuses, as is particularly true for sales people. It also can be 
expanded into general recognition programs where individuals are rewarded for dis-
playing proper engagement behaviors or managers and supervisors are rewarded for 
reinforcing them. In essence, any HR function that involves employees and influ-
ences employee behavior can have an important impact on engagement.

Design Work to Focus on Engagement
A huge part of this process is to make sure that the work inherently allows for 
engagement—­for thinking and being empowered. It can be very frustrating for 
employees when they are asked to be more engaged but then they are still con-
strained by old job descriptions and structures.
Sometimes it is helpful to think about “where the work comes from.” Before work 
can be done, there are management functions that must be fulfilled:
•	 Planning—­objectives, goals, strategies, programs, systems, policies, forecasts
•	 Organizing—­staffing, budgets, equipment, materials, methods
•	 Leading—­communicating, motivating, facilitating, delegating, mediating, 
counseling
•	 Controlling—­auditing, measuring, evaluating, correcting
Traditionally, these functions are all centralized in a manager, supervisor, or 
designated leader, and work is prescribed for employees exactly, sometimes allow-
ing no deviation from their job descriptions. But with an engagement perspective, 
employees are expected to get more involved in planning what work to do, when 
to do it, how goals and standards can be met, and maybe even how to source the 
information or materials needed. They may be involved in not only doing the job 
but controlling it, verifying the quality of the product, checking to see how proce-
dures are working, making adjustments, and so forth.
This concept of empowerment is a vital part of engagement. Empowered 
employees take initiative and are held responsible for the things they do. They have 
ownership in the process, and thus they become fully engaged. Empowerment pro-
grams have been implemented for some time and have become an important part 
of driving the engagement process.
Design Workspaces to Enable Engagement
The workspaces of organizations have changed dramatically from private offices and 
cubicles to rotating desk assignments, couches, standing desks, treadmill desks, 
and even to no desks. One constant thing in the process is that offices have become 
more open. In fact, this openness has been evolving for many years. According to 
the International Facility Management Association, today more than 70 percent of 
employees work in an open-­space environment, and the size of the workplace has 
shrunk from 225 square feet per employee in 2010 to 190 square feet in 2013. Work 
places are smaller and more open, and this leads to some concerns.
The first concern is the actual size of the office. Since it’s shrinking, does it pro-
vide enough space? This is a concern for individuals who often need space for all 
their accessories, devices, files, and work. This has led to some alternative configu-
rations that provide this kind of space apart from the actual workspace.
Another concern is privacy. Privacy issues have changed over the years as work-
place design has evolved. As shown in Figure 6.3, there has been a shifting need for 
privacy according to Steelcase, one of the largest makers of office systems. According 
to their research, in the 1980s there was a call for more privacy and less interaction, 

Engage Employees at Work
115
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
but by the 1990s there was a need for less privacy and more interaction. Now there 
has been another swing in the pendulum, and there is a call for more privacy and 
more interaction, but through interactive devices.35
This leads to a concern for transparency in that now everyone has access to 
everything that everyone else is doing. In an open office, employees can see com-
puter screens, hear conversations, read documents, and access all kinds of messages 
from different devices, making it perhaps too transparent for some. Because of this, 
there is a need to be less transparent.
Another concern is interruptions. Open offices invite people to interrupt fre-
quently, as sometimes there is simply no way to shut the door in an open office. 
Managing interruptions can become a very difficult process. A similar concern is 
distraction within open offices. Hearing noises and seeing what is going on with 
other employees is a huge distraction to many people.
There are several major trends that have been occurring in workspace design. 
The first trend is to recognize the power of the open space environment, despite 
the concerns that arise from it. Figure 6.4 shows the relationship of space and per-
formance.36 Assigned cubicles and private offices are certainly good for individual 
performance, but they are not helpful for group productivity where there is a need

for collaboration that leads to innovation. An innovative organization is in the upper 
right-­hand corner of the diagram, where offices are open and flexible and movement 
is possible between different offices, rooms, and activity areas. Collaboration is an 
important part of engagement, and it is also an important value for organizations 
trying to encourage high performance and innovation at the same time.37
Another important trend is that the space assigned to individuals depends on the 
time that they spend in the office. When people are using offices only a small part 
of the time, they will have a much smaller office. This is a departure from the tradi-
tional way in which office space has been allocated according to the title and rank 
of the employee. Executives who travel a lot may in some cases have a small office 
because they are not there very often. On the other hand, workers involved in major 
projects may need the extra space. Big, private offices are disappearing. They are too 
expensive and not necessarily functional, and problems are created when a person 
is unwilling to be a part of the social experiment of an open-­space environment.
Common areas are developed, like conference rooms or meeting spaces at dif-
ferent places in an open environment, to give people ample opportunities to have 
discussions. Even little nooks can be set aside for people to meet quickly, reflect, 
communicate with a small team, or otherwise pull people together. Workspaces 
are also being designed to get people to interact. For example, Samsung recently 
unveiled plans for a new U.S. headquarters designed in stark contrast to its tradi-
tional buildings.38 Vast outdoor public spaces are sandwiched between floors, a con-
figuration that executives hope will lure engineers and sales people into mingling. 
Likewise, Facebook will soon put several thousand of its employees into a single 
mile-­long room. These companies know that a chance meeting with someone else 
in an office environment is a very important activity for collaboration.
A final trend is that workplaces are becoming more agile. They are not just for 
sitting anymore but also standing, walking, and moving. Research has shown that 
sitting at the computer all day is a very unhealthy practice, and many organizations 
are now trying to give employees the opportunity to get up often, move around, and 
in some cases even use a treadmill desk.39
Design Alternative Work Systems to Maintain Engagement
In the last decade, much progress has been made with alternative work systems, 
particularly in allowing employees to do their work at home. In this arrangement, 
actual employees (not contractors) perform work for their organization at home 
every day of the week. This enables a huge savings in real estate for the office, but 
there are many other benefits as well.
Several arrangements are available. The one that has perhaps the most impact is 
working completely at home. Under this arrangement, employees essentially do all 
their work in the home environment and make very infrequent trips to the office, if 
any at all. To accomplish this, the home office has to be configured as an efficient, 
safe, and healthy work place. This requires effort on the part of the organization to 
ensure, from a technology perspective, that the employee functions the same way 
he or she would in the office.
A second type of arrangement is office sharing, where one or more employees 
share an office. They predominantly work at home, additionally spending short 

Engage Employees at Work
117
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
periods of time in the office. In an ideal situation, two people share one office, but 
the schedule is arranged so that the two employees are not there at the same time.
A third option is hoteling, where several employees work at home but come into 
the office occasionally to do work as well. A suite of offices is available for them to 
use, and they have to make a reservation to use an office. This office space functions, 
essentially, as a hotel where employees check in and out of workspaces.
A fourth type of work arrangement is flex-­time, where employees work some-
times at home, sometimes in the office, and set their own working hours as long 
as they work the prescribed number of hours. This often takes the form of a com-
pressed work week, where employees may work three days with longer hours and 
then have an extra two days off. It could also mean working slightly longer hours 
each day to have a half-­day off or coming to work early in the morning and leaving 
early in the afternoon.
Another option is job sharing, where two people are charged with doing one 
specific job. Each person works about half of the hours, and they coordinate their 
schedules so that they are not both there at the same time. Essentially, they are team-
ing up to get the job done but still working individually (each on a part-­time basis).
Finally, there is part-­time work, where individuals work reduced hours, receive 
limited benefits, and free up office space for others when they are not there. This 
allows employees the flexibility of having more time off while still remaining 
employed with the organization.
Whatever the arrangement, it has to be fully prescribed and have specific condi-
tions and rules. The following box details the work-­at-­home program for a life and 
health insurance company called Family Mutual Insurance (FMI).
Working at Home at FMI
Family Mutual Insurance implemented a work-­at-­home program for two job groups: 
claims examiners and claims processors. The details of the solution were developed 
with proper input, as the design had to be acceptable and the execution flawless for 
this program to be successful.
Design
The design of the program followed the traditional work-­at-­home model, in which 
employees work a full forty-­hour week in a home office designated for this work. Each 
office was equipped with the appropriate interconnectivity to the company, databases, 
and functions, much like an office in one of FMI’s buildings. The pertinent ground rules 
for this arrangement included the following:
	 1.	 The office had to be free of distractions. For example, not locating a television in 
the room was recommended.
	 2.	 Employees had to work on a set schedule if they were required to have direct 
contact with customers, which most did. Employees had to log on at the time they 
began their work and log off when they had completed their work for the day.

Benefits of Working at Home
There are many benefits derived from this type of program. First and foremost, this 
often leads to high levels of job satisfaction, as employees have the convenience of 
working at home and the personal savings of time and money from the elimination 
of their commute. This is particularly important for employees who have to drive 
long distances to go to work. These employees often come to work stressed, and 
their lengthy commutes may take many hours out of their day.
	 3.	 The workflow system contained mechanisms for monitoring the work being 
accomplished. Each activity could be easily tracked to provide a user perfor-
mance profile. In essence, the system determined if a person was working and 
recorded the results.
	 4.	 The home office had to be designed for efficiency, good health, and safety.
	 5.	 Employees were urged to take short breaks and reenergize as necessary and to 
always take a lunch break. The total amount of expected actual work time was 
forty hours per week.
	 6.	 Employees were required to negotiate expectations and agreements with their 
families and significant others.
	 7.	 When employees took time off for personal errands, visits to the doctor, or 
other breaks, this time was subtracted from their time worked. Employees were 
required to make up that time during the week.
	 8.	 Employees had to stay in touch with the office and periodically make contact 
with their immediate manager.
	 9.	 Employees had to sign a work-­at-­home pledge and attend a training session on 
working at home.
	10.	 Because there was an initial investment in equipment, computers, and connec-
tions, employees were required to sign a two-­year commitment to continue to 
work for FMI, with certain conditions. If they were to leave the company before 
the end of two years, they would be required to pay back the setup charges, 
estimated to be about $5,000.
The principal stakeholders agreed on the design. It was reviewed by a group of 
employees in focus groups and then modified to produce the final set of regulations.
Execution
With the design finalized, the program was launched via communications to the target 
group of 950 employees. Employees received memos explaining the program and were 
asked to attend briefing sessions during formal working hours to discuss the work-­at-­
home arrangement. In all, twenty-­one employee meetings were held for the 950 employ-
ees, and managers held meetings with their respective teams to discuss the advantages 
and disadvantages of the process. Employees were given three weeks to decide whether 
to enroll in the program.40

Relations and Compliance: Case Studies in Diversity and Inclusion, Engagement, Compliance

Job satisfaction often leads to retention. Some employees want to work in orga-
nizations where they have an opportunity to work at home, so this is a good way 
to attract employees and keep them. Most studies point to this flexibility leading to 
increased tenure.
Absenteeism is usually reduced with these arrangements. Sometimes employees 
need time to take care of personal errands and unexpected situations. With flexible 
arrangements, they can work those situations into their schedule. Of course, part 
of the rules are for them to ensure that they are completing all their work and 
working the numbers of hours required. Having a work-­at-­home situation may give 
them the flexibility they need to take care of emergencies or critical appointments 
so they do not have to take time off. Additionally, there is less sick time, because 
employees are not exposed to contagious illnesses that may come through an office 
or spread through public contact.
In offices where there is a high risk of accidents, these arrangements will elim-
inate those accidents. This is not a payoff for all organizations, but it is significant 
if there are hazards in the office where employees work.
Most studies show that employees are actually more productive when work-
ing at home. There are several explanations for this. The first is that they are less 
stressed and are more energized to do the work. Second, they often give a little 
more, because they are saving so much time from not commuting that they do 
not mind a little extra effort to make sure their performance is where it needs to 
be. Third, employees are sometimes concerned that their immediate manager may 
think they are not working a full eight hours a day, so they give more just to ensure 
that it does not become an issue. Fourth, there are often distractions at work that 
are avoided at home, such as frequent interruptions by coworkers, longer lunch 
periods, and unnecessary breaks. These productivity payoffs are observed in both 
businesses and governments. For example, one case study for the Internal Revenue 
Service showed improvements in productivity for examiners. Essentially, they could 
handle more cases working at home than they did in the office.
Eliminating the commute alone means there is much less stress with this 
arrangement. Due to stressful commutes, employees are often frazzled when they 
get to work, frazzled when they get home, or both. Working at home eliminates that 
kind of high-­stress activity and often leads to a better work–­life balance. Many people 
credit their work-­at-­home program for making their work–­life balance acceptable.
However, the principle payoff for the organization is the savings in office 
space—­but only if the office space is given up. Sometimes an organization will let 
an employee work at home but still keep an office for them. This is very inefficient, 
as the principle benefit is not realized. When an office space is given up, there is 
often a tremendous savings for an organization, even taking into account the costs 
of the modifications necessary to make the home office acceptable.
This arrangement also brings much applause from politicians and government 
agencies who are trying to ease traffic congestion in cities. Some major cities around 
the world have such congested streets that it takes employees three to four hours to 
make it to work and back each day. Thus some governments provide incentives for 
employers to let employees work at home. In the Netherlands, a proposed law gives 
the employee the right to work at home. The employer must prove that it will not 
work. Additionally, because automobiles are taken off the streets, there are fewer 

120

accidents and traffic incidents. Although it is not a dramatic reduction, it is certainly 
enough to add more monetary benefits to the ROI of working at home.
Finally, the most important benefit is the effect on the planet. Although this is 
not an immediate benefit for a company in terms of monetary savings, it is an intan-
gible asset, and it is certainly a very tangible benefit for the environment, because 
for each automobile that is removed from the traffic flow, the actual tonnage of car-
bon emissions that are prevented from going into the atmosphere can be calculated. 
This is why so many environmental groups uphold working at home as a way of the 
future. Some environmental groups suggest that this is the single greatest action 
employers can take to help the environment. These benefits are huge, and when 
compared to the cost of the program, a very high ROI is delivered.
The FMI example represents a project that was measured all the way through to 
the financial ROI. In this case, 350 claims processors and claims examiners tran-
sitioned to working at home. Although their offices at home had to be equipped 
with the latest technology, including security software, so that they could effectively 
do at home what they were doing at the office, there was still a huge ROI. The pay-
offs included a reduction in office expenses by giving up the office space, reduced 
turnover, and increased productivity as more claims were processed at home than 
at the office. When this improvement was spread over one year and compared to 
the cost of the program, the savings generated a 299 percent ROI, with significant 
intangible benefits as well.41
Making It Work
Obviously, the use of home-­office arrangements, although still growing, represents 
only a fraction of the total workforce. It is not always appropriate, and there are 
some rules that must be followed to make it work:
	 1.	 It should be voluntary. Forcing individuals to work at home usually will not be 
successful. Individuals must also be eligible. They must understand the terms 
and conditions, must want to pursue it, and must follow the rules.
	 2.	 The office must be designed properly for efficiency, effectiveness, and 
well-­being.
	 3.	 There cannot be any distractions, including parental care for children or other 
types of concerns. For example, there can be no television in the room where 
the work is being done.
	 4.	 There must be certain transparency procedures (like logging in and logging out 
each day), guidelines regarding how to make up time when hours are missed, 
communication requirements, and so forth. Work rules must fit the specific 
organization and what is comfortable for the executives and management 
team.
	 5.	 Along with work rules comes the training that is needed to ensure compliance. 
Not all employees know how to work remotely, although they may be convinced 
that they do. There must be some assurance that they understand the ground 
rules and that they are willing to make them work in their situation.
	 6.	 Parallel with the training of the employees, the managers have to have training 
as well. They need to know how to work with employees remotely and how to 
adjust to not having a person always available there at the office.

121

	 7.	 There must be effective two-­way communication so that there is regular report-
ing from the employee and regular follow-­up with the manager. Good, clear 
communications are very critical.
	 8.	 Engagement must be maintained otherwise it could actually dip with a work-­at-­
home arrangement. If employees are not around their support team, receiving 
constant feedback from their manager and coworkers, they might not feel as 
actively engaged.
	 9.	 Career aspects should be considered in the process. Remote employees cannot 
be left out of career development and career enhancement planning. They are 
often concerned that their career may suffer because they are not considered 
an integral part of the group.
	10.	 Finally, all legal and compliance requirements must be followed. There must 
be no discrimination for this offering that would violate any of the regula-
tions for equal employment opportunities and any other contractual or legal 
requirements.
Barriers
The reason that working at home has not become a widespread and common prac-
tice is that there are many barriers to these types of work arrangements. Perhaps 
the number-­one barrier is resistance from the management group. Most managers 
follow the typical command-­and-­control model, and they want to see their employ-
ees regularly so that they can control their work. A lack of trust between managers 
and employees will also keep these arrangements from being effective. Managers 
have to trust employees to act in good faith and make it work.
Having remote employees makes some managers feel that they are less valuable 
to the organization. After all, if managers don’t have to be with the employees, see the 
employees, or meet with the employees, it might be assumed that the managers are not 
needed. This concern will have to be addressed so that managers fully understand the 
purpose of the arrangement and how they can manage employees remotely.
Another barrier is that it doesn’t work for every job, of course. Most jobs require 
a presence—­in a factory, hotel, retail store, and restaurant. When a job requires 
employees to be at a particular place at a particular time, they will not be able to 
work at home.
This arrangement also doesn’t work for every employee. Almost everyone may 
want to take advantage of this arrangement, as it is a nice-­sounding opportunity, 
but there are certain personalities that cannot function alone in an office setting. 
To work at home, a person has to be disciplined and work well without social inter-
action on a routine basis.
Furthermore, this working arrangement can be abused, and this keeps many 
organizations from making this move. Managers may worry that employees will 
say that they are working when they are actually not. Unless employee output can 
be easily measured and monitored, a working-­at-­home arrangement may not work. 
Although its potential has been proven in even creative jobs like those of graphic 
designers and editors, it is certainly more effective when managers can count stan-
dardized items such as processed claims or completed transactions.
Another barrier is that employees may worry about being out of sight and out of 
mind—­that they may be forgotten and that their career advancement prospects will 

122	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
suffer because of it. There is also a fear that engagement may be reduced without the 
social interaction that comes from being in the same space as coworkers.
Finally, the biggest barrier is that it represents a significant change. Some 
executives like to measure the magnitude of their organization by the number of 
employees that they can actually see, the big buildings they occupy, and the large 
meetings that they can conduct. A remote workforce, no matter how vast, is not 
quite so visible.
Along with the barriers come the enablers, and there are many of them, as 
this section has already detailed. As evidenced by studies, there are many benefits 
of working at home for employees and for the organization. It is a good financial 
investment for an organization to pursue. Perhaps the most important benefit is 
the reduction in traffic congestion and environmental pollution. This is why this 
kind of arrangement is pushed by government agencies, environmental groups, and 
technology companies who indicate that they can now duplicate the work at the 
office in the home office. The technology is there, the reasons are there, and this 
should be an important consideration going forward.
Involve Top Executives in the Engagement Process
The role of top executives is very critical in any process, but particularly with engage-
ment. With so much evidence that engagement adds value and so much potential 
for it to add more, most executives are willing to step up and commit resources, 
time, and effort to make sure that engagement works. This involves several areas:
	 1.	 Commitment. The first executive action is committing resources, staff, and 
other processes to make sure that engagement is properly developed, imple-
mented, and supported in the organization.
	 2.	 Communication. Employees carefully weigh messages from the senior execu-
tive team, and what the team says about the engagement process sets the tone 
for others. It also shows the position of executives. Top executives should be 
involved in major announcements, the roll out of programs, and even progress 
assessments. When major actions are taken as a result of engagement input, 
top executives should be involved as well.
	 3.	 Involvement. Top executives must be involved in these programs. They should 
kick off programs and moderate town-­hall meetings about engagement. They 
should participate in learning programs on preparing leaders and managers to 
build engagement in the organization.
	 4.	 Recognition. Top executives have to recognize those who are doing the best 
job. The best way to recognize exemplars of engagement is to promote them, 
reward them, and publicly recognize them. Engagement data should be placed 
alongside key operating results for this to be effective.
	 5.	 Support. Support is more than just providing resources and recognizing those 
who achieve results; it also means supporting the programs, encouraging peo-
ple to be involved, and encouraging others to take action. This shows that lead-
ers genuinely support these programs and their success.
	 6.	 Long-­Term Thinking. Engagement cannot be seen as a fad that comes through 
the organization only to be abandoned for the next fad. Too often this occurs in 

Engage Employees at Work
123
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
organizations—­executives work on “engagement” this year, and “lean thinking” 
the next year, and “open-­book management” the next. The key is to stay with 
it and make it work.
	 7.	 Reference. Refer to engagement often, as a driver of gross productivity, a driver 
of sales, and a driver of profits. Making reference to engagement regularly in 
meetings, reports, press releases, and annual shareholder meetings brings the 
importance of the process into focus. Collectively, these efforts from top exec-
utives, which are often coordinated by the chief human resources officer, will 
make a difference in the success of the engagement effort.
Empower Managers and Leaders to Build Engagement
First-­level managers are key in the organization. They are in the position to make 
or break engagement, and they have to be prepared for it. The first step is to con-
duct learning programs where the issue of engagement is discussed—­how they can 
encourage it, support it, and build it in their work teams. This provides not only 
awareness of engagement but skill-­building around the components of engagement 
to make the process successful in the organization.
Most important, first-­level managers must understand why engagement makes 
a difference. They must become role models of engagement and take an active 
part in ensuring that employees are empowered, are involved in key decisions, and 
assume ownership and accountability for what they do. Managers must demon-
strate what has to be done to make the engagement process work, and they must 
genuinely support it. They must reinforce the concept of engagement, reinforce 
what it means to them, and reinforce their roles in the process.
Much of this involves learning—­learning what engagement is about and what 
makes it work but also learning what it can do for the organization. Position engage-
ment as a process similar to sales training for a sales team, or production training 
for the production group, or IT training for the IT staff. This is an important process 
that managers must learn, apply, and use to drive results. This also means that they 
have to redefine success. Success is not just knowing something but making it work 
and have an impact. Making it work involves the behaviors that are exhibited as 
people collaborate to complete projects, but the impact must show up in improved 
measures of productivity, innovation, quality, and efficiency.
First-­level managers are critical, as they must use all the tools generated around 
engagement. The HR team offers the many processes and tools to be implemented, 
but the frontline leaders can make the difference in the success of the process by 
using the tools appropriately, following up to make sure they work, and reporting 
issues and concerns back to the HR team.
Measure the Progress and Impact of Engagement
Measurement for this process involves several issues. The first one is measuring 
the progress with engagement through an annual survey. This assesses the actual 
perceptions of employees about the progress they are making. The annual survey 
must include several major elements to make it successful.

124	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 It must be carefully planned, sometimes even with input from those who are 
being assessed.
•	 The data must be collected anonymously or confidentially. This is a time to 
collect candid feedback on the progress being made.
•	 The data must be reported back to the respondents quickly, so that they can 
see what the group has said locally and globally.
•	 There must be follow up, some immediately, some later—­all in reference to the 
engagement program. This survey-­feedback-­action loop will ensure that the 
process is taken seriously.
Another measurement issue is linking the engagement scores to a variety of 
outcome measures such as productivity, sales, retention, quality, safety, and so on. 
This is covered in more detail in Chapter 14 and in other references. It is an import-
ant way for the organization, executives, and the HR team to see the value of this 
important process.
Success should also be measured in terms of individual projects, such as lead-
ership communications, coaching, team building, management development, and 
leadership development. These are all programs that often involve parts of the 
engagement process. It is helpful to connect particular programs not only to engage-
ment but to individual measures that may improve in this process. An example of this 
is a program involving managers at a retail fashion store where they were involved 
in a variety of leadership initiatives that also played into the engagement process.42
Finally, measuring ROI is the mandate for many top executives. If the CHRO can 
show executives the return on investing in engagement, it reinforces their commit-
ment to make this process work, and it often improves not only their relationship 
with those involved in engagement but also their respect for the entire talent man-
agement and human resources function. Pushing at least some of the programs to 
the ROI level is very helpful, and ultimately it is possible to show the ROI of the entire 
engagement process. This is something that is covered amply in other resources.43
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
This chapter has highlighted the importance of engagement, which causes employ-
ees to become more involved in and committed to their work. Several elements affect 
employee engagement. The human capital strategy should consider these issues:
•	 The definition of engagement
•	 The role of engagement in the organization
•	 The organization’s structure and process to drive engagement
•	 Responsibility for the implementation of engagement
•	 The engagement implementation model
•	 The measurement strategy for engagement
•	 Workplace design to enable engagement
•	 Alternative work systems to maintain engagement

he title of this chapter is very important, as the words performance, innovation, 
and culture are connected. To achieve high performance in an organization, it 
must be driven by a constant focus on accountability, with a culture that focuses on 
delivering results to the various stakeholders, including customers and investors. To 
sustain this over a period of time often requires constant review and improvement 
of products and services. Innovation is a constant in the process. Innovation can 
come from several sources, but most of it has to come from within, and this is where 
the focus on human capital strategy is so critical.
Figure 7.1 shows the intersection of having a focus on high performance, a cul-
ture of accountability, and a successful approach to innovation. Where they inter-
sect, a very high-­performing, sustainable organization is created. This chapter 
describes culture in terms of how it can help drive performance and accountability, 
and how a performance management system is needed as well. Let’s face it, most 
performance management systems have failed to live up to expectations, and part 
of every human capital strategy should be to revitalize and improve those systems.
Opening Story: The Royal Bank of Canada
The Boston Consulting Group recently reported an excellent example of the impact 
of a performance management system.1 The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)—­Canada’s 
largest bank—­had experienced a significant drop in financial performance. After 
Force 5: Performance and Innovation. Creating and sustain-
ing a high-­performance organization that focuses on innova-
tion is the desire of most organizations. Unfortunately, many 
of them do not actualize it. Achieving a high performance level 
often requires constant reinvention, adaptation, and improve-
ment. It requires serious innovation. This issue is facing every 
organization, and the human capital strategy is the best vehicle 
to address it.

ten years of top-­quartile performance, shareholder returns had fallen to the fourth 
quartile. Through careful analysis and by talking with employees from the front line 
through senior management, CEO Gordon Nixon recognized that fixing organiza-
tional and people issues would be critical for improving financial performance and 
competitive advantage.
Collaboration was poor across businesses. The executive team’s decision-­making 
discipline had slackened—­decisions were made slowly and without consistent anal-
ysis and transparency. And the organization structure, which was costly, was also 
leading to low levels of employee engagement.
The senior leadership team created a comprehensive transformation program that 
addressed operations, culture, and structure. The bank’s management ranks were 
restructured, and initiatives that focused on revenue growth and cost reduction were 
put in place. To ensure the success of these initiatives, each leadership layer created its 
own role charts, so performance expectations and accountabilities were clearly laid out.
The senior team clarified its expectations for leadership behaviors and revised 
the performance management system to reward achievement of financial targets 
and agreed-­on behaviors (such as welcoming challenge, being solution oriented, 
and taking an enterprise-­wide rather than siloed perspective). To keep the effort on 
track, the bank rigorously managed the three-­year transformation by establishing 
clear targets and accountabilities.
The plan worked. Three years after the completion of the transformation, RBC’s 
stock price had doubled, far outstripping the gains of its peers. In subsequent sur-
veys, most employees agreed that the daily activities of the bank and its employ-
ees reflected the vision of the transformation and that leaders were behaving in 
Figure 7.1.  Relationship of performance, innovation, and culture.

accordance with the new values. RBC continues to monitor its performance across 
five organization and people dimensions, and it takes action when performance 
drops or the competitive environment changes.
High-­Performance Organizations
Before discussing ways to improve performance, let’s define a high-­performance 
organization (HPO). Logically, most organizations want to become high perform-
ing, as HPOs create high-­performance work teams, groups, and functions. But 
just what is meant by high performance? The Institute for Corporate Productiv-
ity (http://www.i4cp.com) describes high performance in the context of a market 
performance index (MPI). This measure is a self-­reported rating encompassing 
an organization’s performance in four key areas—­market share, revenue growth, 
profitability, and customer satisfaction—­as compared to the levels achieved five 
years previously. The average of the four ratings determines the MPI score. The 
institute regularly produces documents that compare low-­ and high-­performing 
organizations and the various characteristics that define the two groups. Sometimes 
organizations are identified as being in the top 20 percent, a level desired by HPOs. 
Another organization, the HPO Center, defines a high performance organization 
as one that achieves financial and nonfinancial results that are exceedingly better 
than those of its peer group over a period of five years or more. The specific mea-
sures examined are detailed in Table 7.1. This is more comprehensive and precise, as 
seven financial measures and five important nonfinancial measures are compared. 
What is often missing, however, is the target level that must be achieved on each 
measure to be labeled high performing. Although some ranges are provided by the 
HPO Center for the financial measures, they are quite broad.
Culture
A clearly defined, strong culture of accountability can drive high performance in 
the organization and lead to its sustainability. While there are different definitions 
of culture, one of the best is offered by Edgar Schein in his classic work, as shown 
Table 7.1.  The high performance organization.
A high-­performance organization achieves financial and nonfinancial results that are 
exceedingly better than those of its peer group over a period of five years or more.

in Figure 7.2.2 The first level of culture, at the bottom, comprises the underlying 
assumptions, perceptions, thoughts, and beliefs in an organization. These are 
formed and developed over a period of time and are often very difficult to change. 
Sometimes they are set in place by the original founders of the organization. It is the 
most difficult area for change. The next level comprises the values in an organization, 
which are often defined and documented. Some are very specific; others are vague. 
Usually a strong-­culture firm really lives up to its values. Two examples of written 
values are shown in Tables 7.2 and 7.3. The Coca-­Cola Company is a little vague but 
attempts to set the tone for how the organization should function. Wal-­Mart gets 
more specific, as its values are explained. Wal-­Mart has a history of delivering low 
prices, and they go to extremes to achieve that goal in working with suppliers and 
employees. It all starts with a value system that is fully communicated throughout 
the organization and often becomes integrated into the daily work of employees.
The top cultural level comprises artifacts—­the visible structures and processes. 
This includes the language used, dress codes followed, jokes that are prohibited,

trophies that are admired, special greetings that are provided, and even the arrange-
ment of the offices, furniture, and other visible displays. For example, the offices at 
the headquarters of Wal-­Mart, one of the largest and most profitable companies 
in the world, are very small and modest. Even the CEO’s office is very small with 
very inexpensive furnishings.
While every firm has a culture, a strong culture is desired. If an organization 
has inconsistent assumptions, value systems, and artifacts, then the culture is 
Table 7.3.  The Wal-­Mart values.
Open door
Our management believes open communication is critical to understanding and meeting our associ-
ates’ and our customers’ needs. Associates can trust and rely on the open door; it’s one of the most 
important parts of our culture.
Sundown rule
Observing the sundown rule means we do our best to answer requests by the close of business on 
the day we receive them. Whether it’s a request from a store across the country or a call from down 
the hall, we do our very best to give each other and our customers same-­day service. We do this by 
combining our efforts and depending on each other to get things done.
Grassroots process
Sam Walton’s philosophy lives on today in Wal-­Mart’s grassroots process, our formal way of capturing 
associates’ ideas, suggestions, and concerns.
Three basic beliefs and values
Since the first Wal-­Mart opened in 1962, our culture has thrived by operating with three core beliefs: 
Service to our customers, respect for the individual, and striving for excellence.
Ten-­foot rule
The ten-­foot rule is one of our secrets to customer service. During his many store visits, Sam Walton 
encouraged associates to take this pledge with him: “I promise that whenever I come within ten feet of 
a customer, I will look him in the eye, greet him, and ask if I can help him.”
Servant leadership
Sam Walton believed that effective leaders do not lead from behind their desks: “It’s more important 
than ever that we develop leaders who are servants, who listen to their partners—­their associates—­in 
a way that creates wonderful morale to help the whole team accomplish an overall goal.”
Teamwork
Sam Walton, our founder, believed in the power of teamwork. As our stores grow and the pace of 
modern life quickens, that philosophy of teamwork has only become more important over the years.
Wal-­Mart cheer
Don’t be surprised if you hear our associates shouting this enthusiastically at your local Wal-­Mart store. 
It’s our cheer, and while it might not sound serious, we take it seriously. It’s one way we show pride in 
our company.

irrelevant. For example, if the dress code varies dramatically from department to 
department, then effectively there is no dress code. So the key is to have a strong-­
culture organization. In most organizations, this starts with the founding leaders. 
Because they believe in the organization so much, the founders often communicate, 
reinforce, and reward individuals who adhere to their distinctive culture.
The challenge is that it becomes difficult to change this culture, often taking 
much time, as Figure 7.3 shows.3 The underlying foundation (the beliefs, norms, 
and assumptions) is the most difficult to change. Change requires consistent core 
values and constant reference to them, role models from the top down reinforcing 
the values, and storytelling to explain culture in the organization. Strong-­culture 
firms often have a vibrant storytelling tradition. For example, FedEx is extremely 
proud of some of the stories that have been generated over the years as individuals 
have made extraordinary efforts to deliver packages.
Behaviors, which become a visible part of a culture when people are actually 
practicing it, are easier to change, but still difficult. Selection and promotion sys-
tems must be aligned with desired behaviors. In some organizations, a culture-­value 
instrument is used at the selection stage to determine if an individual’s value sys-
tems are aligned with the organization. This is useful for selecting the right employee 
because it has been shown to be a very good predictor of success. Low scores mean 
individuals may leave soon because they don’t like the culture. High scores mean that 
they will more likely stay with the firm because they find the culture to be a good 
fit. The performance review, evaluation, and management systems described later 
in this chapter should align with the culture that is desired and the behaviors that 
are reflective of this culture. Corporate communications should routinely refer to 
the culture.
At the top level of culture, executives can set strategy to make adjustments to the 
culture. Leaders can be trained to communicate the culture, support the culture,

and reinforce the culture. Even structures in the organization can be modified to fit 
the desired culture. For example, Google redesigned their offices to encourage col-
laboration because it is an important part of their culture. They purposely encour-
age chance meetings between engineering and sales staff, for instance. Cultural 
change can occur at a much faster pace, with quick results, at this level.
In summary, culture is often ingrained in the organization from its beginnings. 
Changing culture requires a determined effort. Some things are very difficult to 
change, some are easier, but either way, it will take determination and consistency 
to make it work. In the context of this chapter, the issue is to integrate high perfor-
mance into the culture, so that individuals can see the need for the performance 
and understand the expectations and rewards for them.
Performance Basics
As a beginning point, it is helpful to understand some of the fundamental issues 
around employee performance: the measures of performance that really matter and 
the ways performance is actually delivered in work settings.
Fundamental Metrics
When determining the type of measures to use, reviewing metric fundamentals can 
be helpful. The first important issue is identifying what makes a measure effective; 
Figure 7.4 shows some of the criteria. Use these criteria as a checklist when consid-
ering which measures should be developed and added to the list of possibilities. 
Also stress the factual basis of the measure and distinguish between the various 
types of facts that go into it, such as anecdotal evidence from employees or empiri-
cal statistics. The basis for facts range from common sense, to what employees “say,” 
to factual data.
•	 No facts. “Common sense tells us that employees will be more satisfied with 
their employer if they are allowed to have a flexible work arrangement.”
•	 Unreliable facts. “Sales professionals say they are more likely to stay with the 
company if they are offered a pay-­for-­performance plan.”
•	 Irrelevant facts. “We have benchmarked three world-­class companies using 
cloud computing: a bank, a hotel chain, and a defense contractor. All reported 
good results.”
•	 Credible facts. “A new procedure in the intensive care unit is reducing infections 
and operational costs.”4
Performance Chain of Impact
How does high performance evolve at the individual level? Figure 7.5 describes the 
types and levels of performance data generated in the process.
Level 0 is inputs into the work environment. These are the tools, the resources, 
and the time needed to do the job—­the necessary prerequisites for a person to be 
able to perform the work. The next four levels are outcomes that result from the 
individual.
Level 1 is reaction. Employees must see that their work is important, relevant, nec-
essary, and maybe even exciting, motivational, or inspiring. This is essential because 

132	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
adverse reaction spells unsatisfactory performance. All those involved must make sure 
that the work is designed and communicated properly to obtain the correct reaction.
Level 2 is learning to do the work, which can occur primarily on the job, through 
the experience itself. It can occur through planned training, rotational assignments, 
or coaching, and it can also occur in a classroom or online. One way or another, the 
employee must learn to do the job properly. If there is no learning, or if the learning 
is inadequate, performance will be unsatisfactory.
Level 3 is application, where actual actions are being taken, projects are under 
way, technology is being used, and procedures are being followed. This is what is 
visible—­what others see when people are working. Table 7.4 shows the types of 
action words that often describe the activity of doing the work, applying what is 
needed on the job. Although executives clearly see that this is a necessary step to 
achieve results, it can go astray through misguided actions or activities.

The key is Level 4: impact. Managers may say they are busy, but are they actually 
getting results? The impact of each individual’s work comprises personal productiv-
ity (output), the mistakes made along the way (quality), the time it takes to do the 
work (time), and the costs accumulated in the process (costs). Output, quality, time, 
and costs are the four major categories of impact. Although these data items roll up 
to the measures at the top—­organizational production, sales, market share, and 
profits—­it all begins at the individual level, driven by the chain of impact detailed in 
Figure 7.5. These levels of data are helpful because they show us the different points 
where things can break down. Part of the purpose of a performance management 
system is to understand what is working and what is not working. This leads us to a 
discussion of how performance management systems themselves are working.
Performance Management Systems
Performance management systems exist in every organization, ranging from 
loosely organized approaches in smaller firms to very detailed, documented, and

bureaucratic functions in many large companies. Of all the human resources 
programs that are designed to improve performance, performance measurement 
systems probably stand out as the most disappointing processes. In far too many 
organizations, the process is not working, and it is disliked by the employees, who 
perceive themselves as victims of the process; the first-level managers, who see 
themselves doing something that is not necessary; and the executives, who are dis-
appointed with the outcomes. It is rare to find an organization that is pleased with 
its performance management system, and such systems often go through periodic 
revisions, updates, and changes. Unfortunately, these changes are made by exam-
ining the old system and making minor, incremental adjustments. What is truly 
needed is to make a complete change in the system.
Things are improving in this area, and Figure 7.6 shows how performance man-
agement systems are shifting. This figure shows the previous approach and the 
approach that needs to be taken in the future. This shift has occurred in some 
organizations, but unfortunately, most have yet to achieve success in this area.
The first category is executive view. Too often, executives see this as something 
that is necessary—­that must be done because everyone else does it. Executives often 
do not see this as a business driver. However, if the performance management sys-
tem works, it should be driving the performance of the organization, and to achieve 
high performance, the system must work at its best.
The purpose of the system has been diluted and misguided, morphing it into a 
documentation process for defending the organization in case there is a challenge. 
It is perceived as a process for managing poor performance, and it is also perceived 
as a tool for documenting the rationale for pay decisions. It has rarely been per-
ceived as a way to actually build the performance of the organization, taking average 
performers and moving them up to above average. Instead, performance systems 
often require managers to spend more time with the high performers (documenting

why they are high performers) and the low performers (documenting why they are 
low performers and the actions planned). This does not leave much time for the 
average performers, where most of the improvement can occur.
The traditional way is to set goals and review them quarterly, or sometimes only 
once a year, with little formal feedback in between. The best approach is to have 
formal review sessions along with more frequent brief sessions about progress and 
feedback, so that it is not merely a once-­a-­year review.
The rewards and pay increases that come through the system are often closely 
guarded and rarely communicated within the organization. In more clever systems, 
rewards and pay increases are more transparent, and the pay-­for-­performance 
focus of the system is clearly described and reflected in the way it is managed and 
administered.
The design focus for many systems has been top-­down, stemming from the 
executives who want to see it implemented. However, the design of the system 
should come from the bottom-­up, with employees deciding what is feasible, what 
will work, and what is fair—­understanding of these issues makes a system much 
more effective.
In traditional systems, the goals were quite rigid. When they were set for the 
year, employees and managers stuck with them. Sometimes they were nonspecific 
or vague. The new approach is to make sure goals are very precise, even in terms of 
application and impact. It is easy to see this precision in Tables 7.5 and 7.6. In addi-
tion to being precise, however, goals should also be flexible. As situations change, 
opportunities to improve may multiply or diminish. The key is to be flexible, smart, 
and clear.

The documentation of the performance management system needs to be as 
simple as possible. In far too many systems, it became complex, sometime with a 
complete book describing the process. Documentation should be informative for 
individuals and also amendable, if it is determined that it is not working well.
Alignment to key business measures has not been clear in many systems, 
prompting a common complaint, “How does this connect to the business of this 
organization?” A more effective way is to make sure that there is explicit alignment. 
As shown in Figure 7.5, connections can be shown to important business measures 
that roll up to critical measures in the organization. Alignment allows people to see 
how they fit in the organization, the difference that they make, and the contribution 
they can provide if they are successful with their goals.
The evaluation focus of the traditional system is to make sure that each employee 
follows the process, ensuring that all forms are completed in a timely manner, are 
accurate, and are properly stored in the system. A better focus is illustrating the con-
tribution of the performance measurement system, showing top executives that there 
is a positive ROI on the implementation or revision of the system.
Finally, the preparation for the traditional system involves training only the man-
agers. In better systems, the preparation involves training the managers, employees,

and teams. Though managers still have the key role in the process and make the 
difference between success and failure, employees need to understand their role 
as well. Figure 7.7 shows the manager’s role at Google. In this case, eight habits of 
highly effective Google managers are communicated throughout the organization 
and serve as a catalyst for many discussions. At the same time, Google presents 
three pitfalls of managers—­things that get in the way of making the process work.
The legal issue is intentionally left out of Figure 7.6 because it is constant. It is 
important for the system to be defensible. Table 7.7 shows the various legal issues 
that must be addressed, based on actual case law.5 Avoiding liability should not be 
the principle reason for meeting these basic requirements, however, as they are very 
logical and fair to all parties. Being able to defend the system is not the primary 
purpose of its design; it is just a secondary issue that is taken care of.
Take a fresh look at your performance management system as you develop 
your human capital strategy. Figure 7.8 provides sixteen steps to follow as the

performance management system is redesigned and revitalized. Following these 
steps will ensure a system that is workable and appropriate for your organization.
Variable Pay Systems
Pay for performance is always an important topic. Actual pay level is not necessarily 
a motivator, but when a bonus is distributed based on performance, it becomes 
recognition, a powerful motivator. To achieve a high-­performance organization, it 
is helpful to pay people for that performance.
The status of pay systems is outlined in Table 7.8, taken from the 2014–­2015 
salary-­increase survey by Aon Hewitt.6 Business incentives are the most common 
method. These are bonus plans that reflect all levels, from individual performance 
to top executives. Second are special recognition plans. These build on the impor-
tance of recognition as a motivator, and many such plans are designed to reward or 
recognize behaviors connected to business performance. Individual performance 
plans are third, still a very dominate method. An example would be a sales bonus 
for a sales person. Team awards, cash profit-­sharing plans, and gainsharing/produc-
tivity plans are less often used but still important.
Variable pay plans have great promise, because if they are designed properly, 
they can deliver high levels of performance. If you really want to recognize perfor-
mance, provide additional pay to reflect that. However, there are some very critical 
issues. The first one is defining the measures of performance, which need to be very 
precise. Alignment is critical, as the measures selected should be clearly connected 
to business goals, maybe directly to strategy. It should be possible to see the line of 
sight from a particular measure connected to the plan to the overall business goals 
in the organization. The next issue is determining who is eligible for the process. 
This must be very clear, as it could create confusion and upset some individuals if 
	 1.	 Identify reasons for previous failures.
	 2.	 Start over with a blank page.
	 3.	 Explain importance of performance management.
	 4.	 Align performance to the business.

	 6.	 Define roles of managers and employees.
	 7.	 Secure executive commitment and support.
	 8.	 Secure support and involvement from managers.
	 9.	 Define/describe performance.
	10.	 Define measures and precision.

	13.	 Document with simplicity in mind.
	14.	 Train managers, teams, and employees.
	15.	 Ensure legal defensibility.

they think they are eligible when they are not. Probably the most critical issue is 
funding—­determining the maximum possible payout and making sure it is set aside 
and available for the individual payouts.
The plan features need to be clearly defined and followed. Targets should be 
realistic and achievable. Communication should be timely, routine, clear, and pre-
cise. Administration of the plan must be flawless.
Innovation
Innovation is critical for sustaining high performance—­not just a matter of chang-
ing, but actually getting better. “Reinvent or die” does have meaning. If organi-
zations do not adapt, they can easily fade away. Innovation means having more 
creative processes, solutions, and products, as well as more creative ways to deliver, 
service, and maintain them.
Innovation comes from many sources, as shown in Figure 7.9. The two most 
important sources are within the organization: the employees, purposely drawn to 
show their larger significance, and the top leadership, which provides the guidance 
for the innovation inside the organization. The collective energy, creative spirit, 
determination, and drive of the employees will make the difference. It is also help-
ful to work with the customers, to find out what they need or want. But sometimes

that is not enough. For example, many of Apple’s products were not built on what 
customers needed or wanted, because Steve Jobs was interested in showing them 
a product that they had not even imagined, describing a need that they did not 
know they had.
Competitors are another source of innovation. It is always helpful to, as the old 
saying goes, “keep your friends (clients) close and your enemies (competitors) closer.” 
Find out what they are doing and learn from them. Maybe your organization can do it 
better or build on what they have accomplished. If an organization doesn’t do this, it 
may be accused of having its head in the sand. A creative spirit also comes from many 
suppliers. Honda, for example, requires that its suppliers be very creative in their work, 
changing and improving as they provide better quality products, with more features 
and innovations, as well as lower costs in some cases. In today’s environment, good 
creative experiences are coming from crowd-­sourcing opportunities, which let the 
public, or some segment of the public, offer suggestions and ideas on how things can 
and should be improved. Additionally, there is basic research developed by different 
organizations designed to help businesses improve. Many universities and research 
think tanks exist for this purpose. Incubators are designed to develop new products 
and services. Collectively, there are many ways in which innovation can occur, but for 
the most part, it is probably going to rest internally with employees.
The heart of innovation is capturing the creative spirit of employees. Employee pro-
grams range from classic suggestion systems to design thinking. In a suggestion sys-
tem, employees are encouraged to provide suggestions for improvement and then are 
rewarded if their suggestion is accepted and implemented. Sometimes these cash awards

can be very lucrative. This might also just involve a suggestion box, where employees 
make suggestions to management regarding how to change and improve things.
Sometimes, sessions are conducted to encourage brainstorming and other idea-­
generating processes. Some companies offer cash prizes for inventive concepts. 
Others source creativity and innovation through a pulse survey of all employees, 
who collectively, usually via a five-­question process, provide input on ideas. These 
ideas are refined back through the employees, and actions are taken by different 
groups, where appropriate, to bring these ideas to fruition.
A more formal approach is a process called “design thinking,” which is illustrated 
in detail in Table 7.9. This process involves groups and a lot of support, and it is 
designed to get people to radically improve the organization with a tremendous 
focus on innovation. Still others are using task-­force approaches to bring groups 
together to develop particular projects. An interesting example of this is a process 
recently presented in Harvard Business Review. This process showed how a min-
imum viable innovation system (MVIS) can be developed in ninety days, when 
groups of people are assembled, possibilities are examined, and processes are devel-
oped. It becomes similar to an internal incubator for new product development, but 
it is quick, and that is key because development normally takes far too much time.7
In conclusion, it is helpful to put in context how an organization can turn 
employees into innovators using any type of process. Table 7.10 shows how it all

works, from defining innovation to celebrating milestones. The challenge is to cap-
ture the creative spirit of employees, providing any needed resources or processes 
necessary to achieve this goal, giving feedback along the way, celebrating success at 
particular milestones, and rewarding employees when success is achieved.
Human Capital Strategy Implications
This important area of performance and innovation, achieved through shifting cul-
ture, sets several imperatives for human capital strategy:
•	 Define the goals of being a high-­performance organization, and set target dates 
to achieve them.
•	 Redesign the performance management system.
•	 Adjust the culture to achieve the level of performance needed.
•	 Clarify the role of pay for performance in the organization.
•	 Implement a variety of creativity and innovation programs, and measure suc-
cess along the way.

his chapter focuses on how employers can reduce the costs of healthcare and 
make employees healthier. Reducing costs is absolutely essential for the finan-
cial sustainability of many organizations. At the same time, the human resources 
function is in the best position to influence the behavior of employees who have 
developed unhealthy habits. For a necessary and dramatic shift in healthcare spend-
ing to be realized, employees must change their habits in terms of diet, exercise, and 
preventative healthcare. This chapter explores the current status and cost of health-
care, how it has affected employers, the deteriorating health status of employees, 
and some solutions that can make a big difference.
Opening Stories
The connection between health and job performance is widely known, and many 
companies are now realizing that success can only be achieved with a healthy 
Force 6: Employee Health. With the dramatically increasing 
cost of healthcare and the fact that in the United States, more 
than 40 percent of healthcare costs are paid by employers, a 
serious problem is developing. Companies can no longer sus-
tain the projected increase in healthcare costs. At the same 
time, employees globally are increasingly unhealthy, creating 
problems with productivity, absenteeism, and accidents. Reduc-
ing or eliminating employee healthcare is not a viable option. 
New and creative solutions are developing that can help enable 
employers to control employee healthcare costs by shifting to 
employer-­funded individual healthcare and taking dramatic and 
comprehensive steps to make employees more healthy. This is 
a critical part of human capital strategy, considering that health-
care is soon projected to cost $4 trillion in the United States, 
representing 17 percent of gross domestic product.

workforce. The implementation of healthy-­living initiatives benefit both employ-
ers and employees. A healthy workforce results in reduced downtime due to ill-
ness, improved morale, increased productivity, and higher employee retention, and 
employees get the benefits of increased job satisfaction and an improved ability to 
handle stress. Plus, getting a workout while getting some work done sounds good, too. 
Here’s a look at three companies that are taking steps to improve employee health.1
Progressive Insurance
Headquartered in Cleveland, this national insurance company helps their twenty-­
five thousand employees stay healthy with an onsite fitness center, Weight Watchers 
reimbursement program, yoga and boot-­camp classes, personal training, and smok-
ing cessation program. Customer representative Carla Minichello lost 150 pounds 
after eighteen months using Progressive’s fitness center.
“These amenities show Progressive’s commitment to employees and their daily 
desire to be productive both in work and life,” says Pamela Sraeel, senior manager of 
benefit services. Sraeel says making a healthy lifestyle more convenient and afford-
able for employees has resulted in a more motivated and less stressed staff. “When 
employees are healthy, they feel good. They innovate, solve problems, and take 
initiative, which is imperative in a tough global marketplace.”
Twitter
This social media giant encourages the thousand employees at its San Francisco 
headquarters to stay healthy by offering onsite yoga, Pilates, Wing Chun Kung Fu, 
and CrossFit classes. Onsite massages and acupuncture sessions are also available 
for a fee.
“The attitude and energy we all bring to work is so important to our culture,” 
says Amy Obana, HR and wellness program manager. “But such energy can make 
us susceptible to fatigue and burnout. Twitter aims to avoid this by offering diverse 
fitness and wellness programs to encourage renewal so that as employees we can 
manage our energy better and get more done in a sustainable way.”
TELUS
This Canadian phone company has approximately twenty-­six thousand employees 
in thirteen locations across the country and offers internal fitness facilities with car-
dio equipment, weight rooms, and group fitness classes, as well as on-­site massage 
and reflexology practitioners, active living challenges, and mental health support.
Janet Crowe, director of wellness and work–­life solutions, says encouraging 
employees to adopt healthy lifestyle habits is part of the culture of TELUS. “It’s the 
overall strategy of TELUS to have a healthy work environment,” she says.
Don’t worry if these kinds of programs seem out of reach for your business. You 
don’t have to build a gymnasium to encourage a healthy workforce. Crowe says well-
ness initiatives are possible no matter how big or small a company is, and having a 
healthy workforce begins with making health a priority in the workplace.
She encourages small businesses to begin by asking employees what initiatives 
would help them. “Don’t assume what your team wants, ask them what they need 
to reach their goals,” she says. Sraeel says reaching out to local gyms to negotiate 
a discount rate or hosting group lunch-­hour walks is something every company

can do no matter the size. Celebrate business goals with a healthy-­cooking class or 
another activity staff identify as something they’d like to try. “Group activities can 
be empowering and team-­building,” says Sraeel.
The New Era in Healthcare
Healthcare reform is front and center in American society, the economy, and the 
political arena. Costs have grown annually, outpacing general inflation for decades, 
compounding the healthcare concern. The weight of this cost trend on Medicare 
has led Congress to pass landmark legislation that is the legacy of the Obama 
administration. The legislation addressed coverage for the uninsured, affordable 
health insurance for small businesses, and coverage for minors and those with pre-­
existing conditions. This legislation was sweeping in nature and has far-­reaching 
implications. In other countries, where a larger share of healthcare costs are usually 
absorbed by the government, the healthcare systems face the same challenge: pro-
vide better patient outcomes, reduce costs, improve patient satisfaction, and serve 
more people.
Substantial Cost Impact
To pay for expanded coverage for the millions of uninsured Americans, a series of 
cuts in Medicare reimbursements to hospitals, physicians, and other providers from 
current levels were used as “prepayment.” The expanded coverage and payments for 
the uninsured were designed to forestall the current practice of cost shifting by hos-
pitals to commercial carriers to cover the uninsured. Hospitals have shifted the cost 
of providing uninsured care to commercially insured payers via increased pricing.
Healthcare reform also allows employers and individuals to purchase coverage 
through state-­run insurance exchanges that bid competitively at lower prices to 
offer coverage. These declining Medicare reimbursement rates, which generally do 
not cover costs in most hospitals, are having a devastating impact on the viability of 
healthcare operations. Consequently, hospitals of all sizes will need to reduce costs 
by as much as 17 percent to break even on Medicare reimbursement.
Changing the Rules of the Game
Payment for services has traditionally been based on a fee-­for-­service model in 
healthcare. Healthcare reform includes modification to the model by shifting to a 
pay-­for-­value-­added model via value-­based purchasing, penalties for readmissions, 
and prices that do not cover excessive utilization but instead reward providers for 
managing population health. The overall concept of the “triple aim” focuses on the 
following:
	 1.	 Decreased costs
	 2.	 Higher value through improved outcomes and services
	 3.	 Expanded coverage to care for a population or community’s health2
The “triple aim” approach is a radical modification of the current model for the 
healthcare enterprise. The healthcare system will shift accordingly with emphasis 
on accountable care.

Rethinking Organization of Care
Currently, analysts claim $365 billion of waste occurs in the healthcare system.3 This 
waste is difficult to avoid in the current fragmented system, which is characterized 
by payers that cover the cost of care for users (patients) provided by an independent, 
fragmented market of providers (physicians and hospitals) that are not integrated 
with care models, information, or costs. The system is full of redundancies and 
inefficiencies of over-­ and undertreatment due to excessive, overlapping, and non-
integrated processes, tests, and treatments. In the current environment, decisions 
for improvement are made incrementally by fragmented groups (physicians, hospi-
tals, insurers, ambulatory centers, etc.), each maximizing returns at the expense of 
the others and at the expense of the patients in the system. Each exploits the other 
at the expense of the whole to maximize individual gains. This action drives costs 
of care up in a never-­ending spiral. Each group also seeks larger scale to leverage 
negotiations, again at the expense of the others and the patients.
Generally, the system comprises tax-­exempt organizations complemented by 
public institutions and independent physicians. Physicians are, however, rapidly 
moving away from independent practice and joining larger groups. These larger 
groups focus on the patient with a “do no harm” perspective with little or no busi-
ness acumen in decision making. This process, therefore, makes limited use of 
financial or mathematical models to determine value added, even when invest-
ments are made with financial objectives.
In essence, the industry will not survive in its current form and must reinvent 
itself with new business models, systems of care, and processes. The system will 
evolve from care per incident, or pay for procedure, to care for a population and pay 
for value.4 This evolution will require a model with lower-­cost structures, medical 
management of care, intelligent information systems, and integrated networks of 
care and physicians, all accountable for population health. Employers are in the 
position to have an important role in this development.
The Challenges
Marshall Goldsmith’s book What Got You Here Won’t Get You There: How Success-
ful People Become Even More Successful is especially appropriate for the healthcare 
industry.5 This industry must transform fundamentally during a time when demand 
will increase significantly due to aging baby boomers, who are turning sixty-­five 
in unprecedented numbers each year. This aging population puts enormous pres-
sures on federal Medicare programs and radically shifts the mix of payers in the 
healthcare industry. As the baby boomers age, they enter the phase of life when the 
average individual consumes the majority of the medical resources a person uses in 
a lifetime. They also demand high quality of care.
More demand, lower prices, and higher expected outcomes and experiences 
require new skills in leadership and tools to permit the industry to determine added 
value of initiatives, interventions, and new methods. The American Hospital Asso-
ciation, among others, has highlighted topics and key skills for success, including 
physician relations, community health, critical thinking, financial and quality inte-
gration, and risk assumption. At the organizational level, boards of directors and 
trustees must apply knowledge and skills in healthcare delivery and performance,

business and finance, and human resources. After all, success is achieved through 
people, and the cost of employees is the largest healthcare expenditure. To misjudge 
the impact and importance of these critical skills will negatively affect an organiza-
tion’s ability to survive during this time of accelerated transition.
The Cost of the U.S. Healthcare System Compared to Other Countries
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) tracks and 
reports on more than 1,200 health system measures across thirty-­four industrialized 
countries.6 In a recent analysis, concentrated on OECD health data for Australia, 
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Swe-
den, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, healthcare spending 
in the United States towers over that of the other countries. The per capita spending 
of about $8,000 per year is about 60 percent more than the next country, Norway. 
Expenditures as a percent of GDP is at 17 percent, with France second at about 
12 percent. Yet, the United States has fewer hospital beds and physicians and its 
citizens make fewer hospital and physician visits than in most other countries. 
Prescription drug utilization, prices, and spending all appear to be highest in the 
United States, as does the supply, utilization, and price of diagnostic imagining. 
U.S. performance on a limited set of quality measures is variable, ranking highly 
on five-­year cancer survival, middling on in-­hospital case-­specific mortality, and 
poorly on hospital admissions for chronic conditions and amputations due to dia-
betes. These findings suggest opportunities for cross-­national learning to improve 
health system performance.
How This Affects Employers
The total cost of healthcare was estimated to be $4 trillion in the United States in 
2014, and 41 percent of this cost was borne by employers as they provided employee 
healthcare as part of their benefits structures.7 Because of this financial burden 
on companies, many of them are declining coverage. From 1999 to 2013, the aver-
age annual premium healthcare companies charged for employee healthcare plans 
increased by approximately 182 percent to roughly $16,350 per family. For single 
coverage, the cost has increased about 168 percent to $5,884 per single.
During this period, many employers stopped providing health benefits entirely. 
U.S. jobs offering health benefits fell to 57 percent of all jobs in 2013, down from 
66 percent in 1999. The future is not bright—­the average cost of employer-­provided 
health insurance is expected to reach approximately $20,000 per family and $8,000 
per single employee in 2016. On average, employees will be paying more and get-
ting less in terms of higher deductibles, higher copays, and higher out-­of-­pocket 
maximums.8
The trend of declining employer-­provided coverage will continue, primarily 
because of the problems generated by employer-­provided healthcare. Table 8.1 indi-
cates the ten reasons employer-­funded healthcare isn’t working.9 In essence, having 
employer-­provided healthcare has caused many of the problems in the healthcare 
system overall, and it is not difficult to see why it works in an adverse way. For exam-
ple, when employers pay for healthcare, insurance companies want to charge more, 
employees want to use the healthcare system more, and hospitals tend to do more 
testing, because, after all, the employer is paying for it. This has sparked excessive

costs through extra caution—­or as some people refer to it, abuse by physicians, 
hospitals, clinics, and employees. More on this shift is covered later.
The Health Status of Employees
You don’t have to look far in the United States, and even in some other countries, to 
see that the health of the population, and employees in particular, has decreased. 
Statistics are presented routinely about this trend. For example, these figures on 
obesity come from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases (NIDDK):
•	 More than two in three adults are considered to be overweight or obese.
•	 More than one in three adults are considered to be obese.
•	 More than one in twenty adults are considered to have extreme obesity.
•	 About one-­third of children and adolescents ages six to nineteen are considered 
to be overweight or obese.
•	 More than one in six children and adolescents ages six to nineteen are consid-
ered to be obese.10
Other statistics detail the increased prevalence of illness and injury:
•	 Diabetes. Obesity has contributed to more than eighteen million Americans 
having diabetes and another forty-­one million over age forty having predia-
betes. Most people with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within ten years. 
Diabetes virtually guarantees that you will have health issues requiring time 
away from work at some point in your life, and 65 percent of people with dia-
betes die from heart disease or stroke.
•	 High blood pressure. About sixty-­five million Americans over age twenty have 
high blood pressure, a chronic disease requiring medication and one that 
Table 8.1.  Ten reasons employer-­funded healthcare isn’t working.
	 1.	 It’s temporary. You lose your health insurance if you or your loved one gets sick.
	 2.	 It’s overpriced. You pay $4,000 to $12,000 more than individual health insurance for the same 
coverage.
	 3.	 It’s risky. Your coverage may be cancelled at any time without notice.
	 4.	 It’s limited. You don’t get to pick your doctors and hospitals.
	 5.	 It’s one-­size-­fits-­all. You don’t get to choose your deductible or copays.
	 6.	 It’s unfair. You are disqualified from receiving your $2,000 to $12,000 per year share of the trillion-­
dollar federal subsidy.
	 7.	 It’s unstable. Your cost could double due to one employee with a million-­dollar claim.
	 8.	 It’s bad for your career. You may stay in a job that doesn’t let you realize your full potential.
	 9.	 It’s bad for your business. You spend time managing health insurance that should be spent on cus-
tomers and products.
	10.	 It’s bad for America. Employer-­provided health insurance is the top reason U.S. healthcare costs are 
almost $4 trillion, approaching one-­fifth the size of the U.S. economy.

dramatically increases the chances of having heart disease during your work-
ing lifetime.
•	 Cancer, heart attack, or stroke. One in four men and one in five women will 
suffer one of these debilitating events before age sixty-­five.
•	 Car accidents. More than three million people are hurt each year in auto acci-
dents. Common injuries include fractures, broken bones, and spinal damage 
resulting in short-­ and long-­term disability.
•	 Other conditions. Most Americans will develop some type of major medical con-
dition at least once during a forty-­five-­year working life—­a condition that could 
likely lead to job termination and loss of employer-­provided health insurance.11
With this deteriorating health status and rapidly increasing healthcare costs, 
solutions that have been developed must become more common, intensive, and 
comprehensive.
Health Status Solution: Health and Wellness Programs
There is no doubt that health and wellness programs are positive for health and 
well-­being. The question may be, “What is the right type of program for my organi-
zation?” This is what the organization must evaluate, and the choices are endless. 
Many company campuses are equipped with weight rooms, tennis courts, and jog-
ging trails. Some companies offer free gym memberships or encourage and spon-
sor competitive events. As with many of the newer health and wellness programs, 
isolating the value of a specific program becomes difficult. With current spending 
on wellness programs equaling approximately 2 percent of an average corporation’s 
total insurance claims, defining that value becomes more important.
Health Screenings
One element of an overall health and wellness program is a health-­screening plan. 
These are designed to provide baseline information about both new and existing 
employees’ physical health. These programs supplement existing programs that 
ensure employees are physically capable of performing their jobs. For example, to 
operate an overhead crane, an employee has to meet certain correctable vision stan-
dards. Employees likely know if they have monocular vision. On the other hand, 
if employees are long-­term smokers and have trouble getting up stairs, there is an 
opportunity to improve their health by encouraging a smoking-­cessation program, 
additional medical treatment, and a very limited exercise program. Presented in a 
positive way, employees are encouraged to improve their heath, resulting in gains 
associated with healthy and productive employees.
Healthy Eating and Nutrition
As with exercise, the connection between good health and nutrition is well estab-
lished. Companies are developing programs to encourage healthy eating both at 
home and in the workplace. Campuses with in-­house dining services are offering 
healthier products. Some companies are simply buying healthy breakfasts and 
lunches for their employees. Another option is swapping out the traditional snacks 
in vending machines for healthier alternatives.

150	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
While promoting healthy eating is not an overly expensive proposition, it is 
still a program that someone in the organization must design, implement, and 
manage.
Smoking-­Cessation Programs
The connection between smoking and poor long-­term health is also well estab-
lished. Most experts agree that smoking takes about a decade off a person’s life. In 
addition, the habit is very expensive for employers. In some cases, smoking cessa-
tion in the work environment is fairly easy to implement: simply prohibit smoking 
anywhere in or around the facility. While there may be some pushback from a group 
that has been going to a smoking pit for the last few years, overall a nonsmoking 
facility is well received by staff and employees. For those with difficulties quitting, 
at least while at work, there are intervention options.
In addition to eliminating smoking from the workplace, companies are looking 
to provide financial incentives for employees to completely quit. While there are a 
few compliance hurdles, companies are establishing two-­tiered health insurance 
programs. Smokers pay a substantially heftier premium than nonsmokers.
In addition to addressing smoking among existing employees, some employ-
ers today are refusing to hire people if they are smokers. Being a smoker is not a 
protected status, and companies that are serious about these issues are not hiring 
those who currently smoke. According to the CDC, smoking accounts for $96 billion 
in direct medical costs and another $97 billion in lost productivity and premature 
death.12 Therefore business takes smoking seriously.
Obesity Programs
Foremost among the health issues plaguing this country and its workforce is the 
obesity problem. The health effects of obesity are well known. Obesity can lead to 
a number of conditions:
•	 Type 2 diabetes
•	 Heart-­related illnesses such as high blood pressure and stroke
•	 High cholesterol
•	 Osteoarthritis
•	 Gall bladder disease
•	 Liver disease and other illnesses
Obese workers are less healthy, miss more work, and drive up insurance 
costs. Companies are implementing programs to combat obesity. One place to 
start is with an employee health-­screening program. As a part of that program, 
encouragement to lose weight and to improve health can be initiated in a positive 
way with the privacy of medical staff. Other obesity program efforts include the 
following:
•	 Educational programs
•	 Fitness activities
•	 Individual treatment
•	 Moral support groups

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
All these programs are being used as obesity-­reduction initiatives in the busi-
ness community.
Industrial Hygiene
While the role of the industrial hygienist remains devoted to the anticipation, rec-
ognition, evaluation, prevention, and control of stressors arising from the work-
place, a considerable amount of industrial hygiene work has moved from the shop 
floor to the main office. Today’s industrial hygienist spends a great deal of time 
working on programs to prevent poor indoor air quality (sick building syndrome, 
second hand smoke), exposure to diseases such as AIDS and other blood-­borne 
pathogens, and cumulative trauma disorders.
In addition to these newer programs, industrial hygienists continue to develop 
and initiate programs that include the following:
•	 Managing chemical exposures
•	 Detecting and controlling exposures in the areas of radiation (ionizing and 
non-ionizing), noise, and illumination
•	 Emergency response and hazard awareness
More than ever, the programs within the industrial hygiene field impact all 
employees.
Ergonomics
With the rising cost of healthcare and the increase in musculoskeletal disorders 
(MSDs) as a portion of workplace injuries, much focus has been placed on the 
field of ergonomics in the workplace. In fact, MSDs are the most common form of 
workplace illness in industrialized nations. MSDs include carpal tunnel syndrome, 
repetitive strain injuries, and cumulative trauma disorders.
Comprehensive ergonomic programs are being developed. These programs 
include extensive training for employees and management, surveillance of data to 
spot trends early, case management of all MSD illnesses, job analyses, and design 
to address ergonomic risk factors (force, repetition, awkward postures, static pos-
tures, vibration). While these programs address the multidisciplinary sciences 
addressing the interface between the employee and the work performed, the value 
of these programs is often unclear. Productivity improvements are hard to isolate. 
MSDs may also be caused or aggravated by activities outside the work area, and 
the treatment of these illnesses is different for each individual. While it is widely 
believed that a sound ergonomics program brings value to the business, determin-
ing that value is a difficult task.
Stress Management
According to the Institute of Stress, employers lose $300 billion annually due to 
excessive worker stress. This is before the impact of healthcare costs, which are nearly 
50 percent higher for workers reporting high levels of stress. Given these numbers, 
stress management/reduction programs are getting ample attention in the business 
community. Companies are making various efforts to reduce stress in the workplace. 
Some of these programs include the following:

152	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Bringing pets to work
•	 Assistance with time management
•	 Classes on financial wellness
•	 Time off for exercise
•	 Time for meditation
•	 Mutual support pairings
While the value of some of these programs may remain questionable, employers 
have recognized that stress arising from the workplace impacts the bottom line and 
are taking action.
The Payoff of Investing in Employee Health
The landscape is covered with all types of healthy-­living initiatives and projects. 
Health, wellness, and fitness programs are everywhere. They touch every part of a 
business’s operations and each employee within the business. These programs must 
be integrated, managed, and properly implemented to reap the greatest rewards. 
There are several factors that help drive the changes that are taking place in the 
health and safety profession.
The most important point is that these programs work, but only if they are 
implemented properly. For example, Johnson & Johnson has reported dramatic 
results with their wellness program. Since 1995, the percentage of Johnson & John-
son employees who smoke has dropped by more than two-­thirds. The number who 
have high blood pressure or who are physically inactive has also declined—­by more 
than half. That’s great, obviously, but should it matter to managers? Well, it turns 
out that a comprehensive, strategically designed investment in employees’ social, 
mental, and physical health pays off. J&J’s leaders estimate that wellness programs 
have cumulatively saved the company $250 million on healthcare costs over the 
past decade; from 2002 to 2008, the return was $2.71 for every dollar spent. Similar 
savings are reported in other companies such as Chevron, HEB, Lowe’s, Nelnet, and 
SAS Institute.13
Investing in healthy living is not new. It has been practiced for many years, and it 
has developed in phases, as shown in Table 8.2. The initial investment was based on 
image, recognizing that it is good to be taking care of employees. The focus was the 
job satisfaction of the employees involved. Then it became a benefit, implemented to 
attract and retain employees. The measurement focus was job satisfaction, participa-
tion, and recruiting image. With healthcare costs increasing, these programs became 
focused on cost control. Healthy living is a way to control healthcare costs, improve 
productivity, reduce absenteeism, and prevent accidents. Health insurance plans pro-
vide coverage for preventive programs in the healthcare plan, and health and wellness 
programs are offered in the organization. The measurement focus was participation, 
healthcare costs, productivity, absenteeism, and accidents. In today’s climate, healthy 
living has moved to more of a business focus, recognizing that improving employee 
health is a great investment when the economic benefits of these programs are com-
pared to their cost. However, these improvements will not occur unless the programs 
are implemented with proper planning, leadership, and execution.
Table 8.3 shows the key ingredients for the success of health and wellness 
programs. Leadership is necessary at all levels, from those at the top throughout

the management ranks. The program must be aligned to the business, with clear 
business goals. The programs must be designed and executed focusing on what is 
necessary, convenient, and important for employees. The programs must be suc-
cessful in terms of participation rates and ultimate outcomes. But most of all, the 
programs should be accessible to all—­at least in some capacity. Some programs are 
more accessible than others, obviously, but ideally they should be available to all 
employees when possible. Low-­cost or no-­cost programs are preferred, and having 
them integrated on site is a plus. Partnerships should be established with a variety 
of groups that are available to help, either internally to promote the group process, 
or externally with all kinds of organizations in the healthcare improvement field.
Communication with all stakeholders is critical, letting them know why the pro-
grams are being implemented, the importance of these programs to employees, and 
why the company is pursuing them in such an aggressive way. At the same time, the

successes along the way have to be detailed. The outcomes must be developed at the 
business level, and the lower part of Table 8.3 shows an impressive list of possible out-
comes. These are reported in a variety of documents. It is easy to find these kinds of 
programs available, and when implemented, they can have a tremendous impact on not 
only the health status of employees but ultimately the bottom line of the organization.
Wellness programs must withstand criticism. For example, in the carrot-­and-­
stick approach, programs have “carrots” to entice people to join and also have 
“sticks” that force them to do so.14 This is supported by the Affordable Care Act in 
the United States. For example, the state of Maryland said its wellness program, 
required as part of insurance coverage, could bring penalties of as much as $450 
per person by 2017 for those who fail to undergo certain screening and fail to fol-
low treatment plans for chronic conditions. The state said the program could save  
$4 billion over the next ten years, according to news reports.15
The “sticks” sometimes create problems, because some groups suggest that they 
may violate other laws that protect people with disabilities. In places where obesity 
is defined as a disability, it may be difficult to force people with obesity into this 
process. Nevertheless, these issues must be addressed in a very aggressive way by 
employers to reduce healthcare costs and improve the health status of employees.
Healthcare Cost Solution: Shift to  
Employer-­Funded Individual Healthcare
A huge change is evolving in healthcare in the United States, as employees are 
shifting to defined-­contribution health benefits. Instead of providing a healthcare 
plan that continues to increase in cost and be abused, an employer with a defined-­
contribution health benefit essentially provides money to employees, either taxable 
or tax free, for them to purchase individual healthcare coverage. This is consistent 
with the Affordable Care Act and seems to have great potential. Table 8.4 shows ten 
reasons to have individual health coverage.
Table 8.4.  Ten advantages of individual health coverage.
	 1.	 It’s portable. You keep your health insurance if you or your loved one gets sick.
	 2.	 It’s 20 to 60 percent less expensive. You and your employer pay $4,000 to $12,000 less for the same 
coverage.
	 3.	 It’s permanent. Your coverage cannot be canceled as long as your pay your premium.
	 4.	 It’s not limited. You get to pick your doctors and hospitals.
	 5.	 It’s customizable. You choose your deductible and copays.
	 6.	 It’s subsidized. You may be eligible for a $2,000 to $12,000 per year share of the trillion-­dollar 
federal subsidy.
	 7.	 It’s stable. You’re in a large group, and your after-­subsidy cost can only increase with your income.
	 8.	 It’s good for careers. You are free to change jobs based on what’s best for your career rather than 
what’s best for your healthcare.
	 9.	 It’s good for business. You spend more time focusing on customers and products.
	10.	 It’s good for America. It empowers Americans to manage their own healthcare, and it makes Ameri-
can businesses more competitive.

With these many benefits for the employee and cost advantages for the 
employer, this inevitably will be a huge trend. For example, Table 8.5 shows that 
the percentage of employers offering healthcare benefits has been changing.16 This 
will continue, and it is estimated that 60 percent of small businesses will switch to 
defined-­contribution plans by the year 2018.17
This trend will evolve by necessity, but it is also a creative way of handling the 
problems of rising healthcare costs and declining employee health status. This is 
similar to the huge adjustment that was made in retirement plans in the 1970s and 
1980s as employers switched from defined-­benefits plans to defined-­contribution 
plans. This follows the same concept and shifts the burden of healthcare evenly 
between employees, the government, and employers.
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
Several recommendations for human capital strategy emerge from the discussion in 
this chapter. As a preliminary step, you should have a full accounting of the current 
cost of healthcare and how it has changed in recent years. With that backdrop, it 
will be clear that individual strategies should do the following:
•	 Include more preventive coverage within the current healthcare plan until 
major adjustments can be made.
•	 Shift the coverage from employer-­provided health insurance to employer-­
funded individual health coverage. Serious communications are needed for 
this shift, and sometimes negotiations with unions may even be necessary.
•	 Develop and implement comprehensive and sustainable health and wellness 
programs for all employees, and ensure that the programs are fully functioning 
in the organization.
•	 Promote healthy living routinely with reportable results.

Force 7: Demographics and Societal Changes. One of the 
most important forces that is affecting all workplaces is how 
the workforce has changed—­how the lives of people making 
up the workforce have shifted. The principal drivers are the 
pronounced changes in the age, gender, race, and ethnic back-
ground of employees. The challenge of having five generations 
at work, the rising role of females in organizations, the migra-
tion of employees across cities and countries, the shifts in the 
makeup of families, various causes of distrust in institutions, and 
declining happiness dramatically affect the quantity and quality 
of members of the workforce. The way in which these factors 
are managed can make a major difference in the success or 
failure of an organization, and the human capital strategy is the 
starting point in addressing these major changes.

Opening Story: Dropbox
Dropbox is a free service that lets you upload and store your photos, documents, and 
videos, access your files easily from anywhere and share them with just a few clicks. 
Dropbox was founded in 2007 by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, two MIT 
students who were tired of emailing files to themselves to work on across multiple 
devices.1 Today, more than 300 million people across the globe use Dropbox to share 
files with family, friends, and work teams.A recent article in USA Today highlighted 
the struggle at Dropbox to confront diversity.2
Employees in the company’s San Francisco headquarters have enjoyed many 
perks such as: a Michelin-­rated chef, a music lounge for late-­night jam sessions, and 
major-­league views of the San Francisco Giants’ ball park and the San Francisco Bay. 
Yet beneath the gleaming surface, the promising young start-­up was wrestling with 
a serious problem. Like other major technology companies, Dropbox employed 
mostly white and Asian men.
“Press on the issue wasn’t good, which further impacted morale on the topic 
internally,” said Blaire Mattson, head of engagement and monetization at Dropbox. 
“There were a lot of people working on increasing diversity within Dropbox, and 
the efforts were showing results. So, for all the people who had worked really hard, 
the press was distressing.”
Because of this, Dropbox’s CEO, Drew Houston, resolved to change the culture 
of his own company much in the same way he changed the way to transport files 
seven years ago.
The founders had always envisioned Dropbox as a place where everyone would 
feel welcome, and with more than two-­thirds of Dropbox users hailing from out-
side the United States, they knew they had to build a diverse workforce to design 
products and services that appeal to a global marketplace.
The CEO thought that Dropbox is still young and agile enough to make pro-
found changes to how it recruits and treats employees, including building an inclu-
sive community and culture. Dropbox is also determined to increase the number of 
women and underrepresented minorities going into technology.
For years, Silicon Valley companies have downplayed the racial and gender 
imbalance in the technology industry. But now they are serious about making their 
workforces more diverse. Silicon Valley has good reason to care about bringing 
more women and minorities into the fold: Studies show that companies with gender 
and ethnic diversity are more creative and more profitable. Yet reports from major 
technology companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google paint a sobering portrait 
of an industry with too few women and even fewer blacks and Hispanics in all roles 
and at all levels.
On November 5, 2014, Dropbox became the latest high-­tech company to release 
its diversity numbers. The report shows that Dropbox looks much like other tech 
companies:
•	 More than half of the Dropbox workforce (nearly 56 percent) is white, and 
nearly a third (30 percent) is Asian.
•	 Women account for about a third (33.9 percent) of the Dropbox workforce but 
nearly 50 percent of staff in nontechnical positions.

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Women account for just 12.8 percent of staff in technical positions and about a 
third of staff in management (32.7 percent).
•	 The percentage of blacks is low even compared to other tech companies. Blacks 
account for 1 percent of the Dropbox workforce, Hispanics for 3.7 percent. In 
technical positions, 0.3 percent of the staff are black and 2.3 percent are Hispanic.
Company executives consulted leading experts in diversity, including Joan Wil-
liams from the Clayman Institute. They also spoke with prominent women in the 
technology industry who are passionate about the issue, notably Facebook’s chief 
operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, and Megan Smith, a former Google executive 
who is now the chief technology officer of the United States. In fewer than ten 
months, Dropbox doubled the percentage of women working in engineering and 
tripled the percentage of women working in design, according to Dropbox general 
counsel Ramsey Homsany, who also oversees public policy and people operations.
Today, diversity is part of everyday business at Dropbox, from all-­hands meet-
ings to hackathons. Dropbox has overhauled recruiting, promotion, compensation, 
engagement, and retention, said Mattson. From changing the questions it asks job 
applicants to training moderators to detect bias in the recruiting process, Dropbox 
is going for “an objective lens” when making hiring decisions, she said. Dropbox has 
also identified areas where bias may creep into performance evaluations and stymie 
career advancement. A new program called “Matchbox” pairs employees with men-
tors. “Droptalks” feature women and people of color, including Task-­Rabbit Chief 
Operating Officer Stacey Brown-­Philpot and Hewlett-­Packard CEO Meg Whitman. 
Justin Bethune, an account manager who is African American, came up with the 
idea for a “Dropbox Dreamcode Tour” during hack week in the summer of 2014. 
Bethune is visiting high school kids in the Bay Area to share what it’s like to work 
inside a tech company and to encourage them to explore tech as a career. He also led 
Dropbox’s first tour of historically black colleges and universities. This brief story 
highlights the problems facing organizations that ignore diversity and inclusion. 
It also highlights the challenges they face to bring about the changes needed as 
described in this chapter.
Increasing Longevity
The average lifespan of people has changed dramatically in the past century. For 
example, in Western Europe in 1800, less than 25 percent of males survived to age 
sixty, while by 2010, that figure was up to more than 90 percent. A sixty-­year-­old 
man in Western Europe today has the same life expectancy as a forty-­three-­year-­
old man in 1800. In the United States, the portion of the population over the age of 
sixty in 2000 was 16.5 percent. In 2025, it will be 25 percent.3 This collective aging has 
become a disruptive force in many countries and economies. For example, Japan’s 
population by midcentury may reduce by half, and nearly a third will be over age 
sixty-­five. Seventy-­seven million American baby boomers born between 1946 and 
1964 are now passing age sixty-­five—­nearly one every seven seconds. The expec-
tations, experience, and value systems of these older people have changed. They 
usually have better health, more education, and more income than previous gen-
erations, and they expect improved quality of life from having access to healthcare,

connecting to love ones, and remaining engaged in rather than retired from society. 
These dramatic shifts raise important issues for organizations.
Longer Careers
The trends are showing that more people want to work longer. Figure 9.1 shows 
how workforce participation is changing and has shifted dramatically. In 1992,  
11.5 percent of the workforce was sixty-­five and older. This will be doubled by 2022, 
when 23 percent will be sixty-­five and older. This is being driven by several forces. 
First, there are now fewer restrictions on people working into old age. In the United 
States, for example, in most occupations, it is illegal to force a person to retire based 
on age; it has to be based on job performance and other objective issues. Second, 
it is well-­known that a person who is active and continues to work will live longer. 
Retirement spells death for many individuals; working longer means a longer life. 
Third, the need for more money has prompted some individuals to continue to 
work. Retirement financial planning has not worked for many, as the lifestyles they 
enjoyed while working require an income stream. And finally, some people just 
enjoy their work. If you have enjoyable work and you want to stay involved, then 
why should you retire? This is a question faced by many knowledge workers and 
professionals who really enjoy the type and nature of the work they do.
Retirement Income
Longer lifespans mean that people need more retirement funds to survive. Unfor-
tunately, not every individual has properly planned for this, and company pensions

are less than what they used to be. This often leaves huge gaps. Compounding this 
is the inability of many governments to continue to fund retirement benefits or 
increase retirement benefits to keep up with the rising cost of living. This means 
that many retirees are poor, and more of them will be poor in the future. This cre-
ates a huge burden for society and sometimes also for employers who provide fixed 
retirement benefits. In some extreme cases, bulging retirement costs have caused 
organizations to go into bankruptcy. Cities and counties in the United States have 
had to declare bankruptcy or default on bonds for the same reason. This generates 
a serious crisis for funding the lifestyles of people who are growing older.
The increase in longevity is driven in part by advances in healthcare technology, 
medicines, and new procedures. Increasing the average lifespan comes at a very high 
cost. The budgets of countries, organizations, and individuals are being strained 
to cover these increases in healthcare costs. This issue was explored in previous 
chapters.
Creative Solutions
With this myriad of retirement cost and income issues, many organizations are 
seeking creative solutions. It may indeed help to encourage the older members 
of the workforce (traditionalists and baby boomers) to work more years and to 
tap into their expertise and knowledge. They can serve as subject-­matter experts. 
Traditionalists can work fewer hours on a part-­time basis in lieu of full-­time work. 
Employers can take advantage of their expertise and knowledge by assigning them 
to special projects in the organization. These could involve tackling a pesky prob-
lem, developing a new product, or implementing a new system. These employees 
can work on social-­service projects while they are actually on the payroll instead 
of giving money to charitable trusts. This provides employment, either full time or 
part time, to this segment of the community and perhaps adds more value than a 
donation in money would.
These are only a few of the possible solutions that need to be explored as organi-
zations try to maximize the contribution of the aging population as efficiently and 
effectively as possible. This all has to be accomplished with an eye on the unem-
ployment issue. After all, millennials will quickly suggest that one way to improve 
the unemployment rate of millennials is to force baby boomers to retire. Both view-
points have to be taken into account.
The Emergence of Gen Y
It is now possible for organizations to have five generations of employees at work at 
the same time. Figure 9.2 shows the breakdown of these different groups, ranging 
from the traditionalists to Generation Z. In 2005, the boomers were obviously a big 
part of the workforce, while Gen Z had not made it to employment age yet. In 2010, 
shifts started to occur. In 2015, Gen Z is included, and then the projections are that 
the millennials, Gen Y, will make up 75 percent of the workforce by 2020.
The millennials have been perhaps the most talked about group in organiza-
tions. They grew up in an environment connected to technology, are communicat-
ing in different ways, and have different value systems than previous generations. 
They have evolved with some very pronounced changes in the way they perceive 

162	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy

work and the kind of work that they want to do.4,5 Although some would argue 
that millennials want the same qualities in a job as others do, the difference is that 
millennials put a much higher priority on these desired qualities than previous 
generations. Having a high salary and a prestigious title is of less interest to millen-
nials. However, a work–­life balance is very critical, and an opportunity to learn and 
develop one’s own competencies is very critical as well. This means that millennials 
want to constantly learn from others. They also want to serve a greater good, and 
this often brings them into concerns about the environment and sustainability. 
Sometimes, this motivates them to work for nonprofits. Millennials also want to

engage with the latest technology and devices. They grew up this way, and they 
want to continue to connect with others this way. They want to use text messages 
and social networks to communicate with others. They want a respectful workplace 
that will give them the autonomy and freedom to do their work without close super-
vision or micromanaging. They want a chance to be creative and challenge their 
intellectual capabilities.
The reality is that an employer must be willing to meet these requirements or 
risk having millennials leave an organization. After all, by the year 2020, these value 
systems will be held by 75 percent of employees.
Millennials also bring some new behaviors. While some of the classic behav-
iors are still very important, there are new behaviors particularly appropriate for 
millennials. As shown in Figure 9.3, these individuals want to be proactive and 
self-­directed on their projects. Employers have to foster, reward, and encourage 
these behaviors. This generation needs to work independently, and this will need 
to be supported by the organization. Millennials need to filter information, because 
they are bombarded with so many different kinds of information. The ability to put 
filters on different information systems and processes will be an important skill 
set. Because there are so many possibilities, and so many things that would take 
their time, they have to constantly focus on what must be done. Some argue that 
millennials have a way of not following through with things, so this particular skill 
set helps them determine priorities. Since the workforce, the workplace, and the 
work itself are constantly changing, the ability to embrace change is critical, and it 
has to be supported and developed.
Finally, enhancing communication skills will be critical, as well as learning to 
learn. Although millennials communicate in different ways than other generations, 
they must have an outstanding communication skill set. They are often criticized as 
not communicating properly and sometimes not closing the loop in follow-­up, so 
the critical issue is to make sure that these skills are properly in place.
There is no doubt that the millennials will create some challenges, but for some, 
these are necessary challenges. When managed and supported properly, millennials 
can add much value to organizations.

Shifting Roles of Women and Men
The progress of women and their changing leadership roles are evident in all types 
of organizations. The German chancellor, the head of the International Monetary 
Fund, and the chair of the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States are all women. 
In Fortune 500 companies, the CEOs of General Motors, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Pep-
siCo, Lockheed Martin, DuPont, Oracle, General Dynamics, Duke Energy, and Xerox 
Corporation, among others, are all women. Today, 60 percent of the world’s uni-
versity graduates are women, and women control the majority of consumer-­goods 
buying decisions. In the United States, women under thirty out-­earn their male 
peers, and 40 percent of American households have women as their breadwinners.
With this tremendous progress comes some concerns. Women make up 51 per-
cent of the U.S. population and 47 percent of the workforce, yet only 4 percent 
of CEOs and 17 percent of board members are women, according to Catalyst, a 
nonprofit market researcher. Women also earn, on average, 78 cents for every $1 
men earn, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.6 “Almost no one 
understands that women have made no progress at the top in 10 years—­that is true 
of any industry and government,” Sheryl Sandburg says. Sandburg is the chief oper-
ating officer of Facebook and author of the bestselling book Lean In: Women, Work, 
and the Will to Lead.7 “I want to change the conversation from what we can’t do to 
what we can do.”8 If nothing else, Sandburg wants to erase workplace stereotypes 
and dispel the perception that a woman can’t have it all. One common theme in her 
book is the observation that as men advance, they are more liked, but as women 
make such strides, they are less liked.
While Sandburg’s personal crusade has earned her much admiration, it has 
detractors. They reject what they deem the “Superwoman ideal,” especially one that 
comes from an executive-­suite mom who has the finances to afford child care and 
other amenities.9
Trends
Labor-­force participation has changed. As Figure 9.4 shows, the labor-­force partic-
ipation of men has declined since 1992, and this decline is projected to continue

through 2022. For women, the participation rate is about the same, which means 
the proportion of female employees has grown. There are still challenges. While 
57.7 percent of women participated in the labor force overall in 2012, in some com-
panies, their participation was still very low, when it should have been much higher. 
For example, in 2014, when Goggle released its diversity report, 30 percent of its 
workforce was female, while 70 percent was male.
In terms of ascending to leadership roles, however, the progress has been very 
impressive. According to 2020 Women on Boards, the percentage of women on 
boards has steadily increased, as shown in Figure 9.5. For the Fortune 100, 500, and 
1000 companies, there have been increases each year in the last four years where 
they have been reported. In 2015, twenty-­five of the Fortune 100 CEOs are female, 
as well as twenty-­eight of the Fortune 500 to 1000 CEOs, for a total of fifty-­three 
women CEOs in the top 1000. Although this is progress, this is woefully inadequate 
when considering the number of women in the workforce.
Current female CEOs are making important strides to try to help with this situ-
ation. For example, Karen Abramson of Wolters Kluwer, a company with nineteen 
thousand employees in information software and services, indicates that their prog-
ress is very important:
At Wolters Kluwer, we’re very fortunate that, as a result of our efforts to 
bolster the senior team with women, today 50 percent of our senior team 
is female, and we really try to promote and foster female leadership. In 
accounting, 40 percent of the people coming into the field are women, but 
they account for only 14 percent of the people who have partnership and exec-
utive positions in the industry. The question is why. I think what we do dif-
ferently at Wolters Kluwer is we foster general management skills by giving 
women P&L [profit and loss] responsibility. It’s really important that women 
take the jobs that are going to get them noticed. Those are always the jobs that 
have clear P&L responsibility.10

Regarding some specific occupations, there is some good news as well. Since 1970, 
some dramatic changes have been made in female participation in certain jobs. For 
example, in accounting, the percentage of women in the profession moved from 24.6 
percent to the current rate of 60 percent; for pharmacists, it moved from 12 percent 
to almost 53 percent; for physicians and surgeons, it moved from 9.7 percent to 32.4 
percent; while for lawyers and judges, it moved from 4.9 percent to 32.4 percent. For 
positions that were predominately filled by women for many years, such as cashiers, 
registered nurses, and elementary and middle school teachers, female participation has 
declined, which is good news. This means that more men are moving into those jobs.11
Skills and Competencies
Do females have much better leadership skills than males? An article in the Harvard 
Business Review featured a study of 7,300 leaders and yielded interesting results.12 
According to the findings, women are rated higher than men in leadership effec-
tiveness in every single stage of company growth, whether they are individual con-
tributors, middle managers, or executives.
The article also went on to reveal that out of the top sixteen competencies that 
leaders exemplify most, women rank higher than men in fifteen of them, often by 
a considerable margin. These include things such as taking initiative, developing 
others, building relationships, innovating, developing technical and professional 
expertise, collaborating, and championing change. The only area where men nar-
rowly edged ahead was “developing strategic perspective,” where men scored a 51 
and women a 49—­but in every other area, women ranked higher.
The aim here isn’t to say that women are better than men or vice versa. Instead, 
it is to point out that women are actually very valuable to the future of organizations 
and possess many of the desired skills and attributes needed to lead organizations. 
Men do as well, which is why it is important to have an equal balance.
The management consulting firm McKinsey has a group called “Women Mat-
ter.” When this group asked business executives around the world what the most 
important leadership characteristics are, the top four attributes were intellectual 
stimulation, inspiration, participatory decision making, and setting expectations 
and rewards. According to Women Matter, all four of these qualities are more com-
monly found among women leaders.13
Dr. Alice Eagly, a professor at Northwestern University who specializes in gender 
differences and leadership styles, writes that there are several unique differences 
between men and women in terms of leadership.
Men’s styles are characterized as the following:
•	 Task oriented
•	 Autocratic
•	 Command-­and-­control oriented
•	 Punishment oriented
Women’s styles are characterized as the following:
•	 Collaborative
•	 Democratic

Embrace Demographics and Societal Changes
167
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Transformational
•	 Reward oriented
Clearly, this isn’t to say that all men lean more toward leadership focused on 
punishment and all women toward leadership focused on rewards. However, this 
does provide some interesting things to think about and observe in the workforce. 
The future organization simply cannot be as competitive without having more 
women in senior leadership roles.14
Issues
This development of females and the need for more females to be in powerful roles 
has created some issues for organizations as well as family units.
The first is the role of the “balance male.” It is estimated that 20 to 30 percent of 
households have females as breadwinners and males assisting in the classic, tradi-
tional roles of females. The stay-­at-­home “Mr. Mom” is not an unusual occurrence 
in many families. The stigma of this role reversal is being removed, and it is now 
often applauded instead of ridiculed.
Career development is another issue. As Sheryl Sandburg has highlighted, it is 
possible to be able to progress in a career and have a good family life as well. The 
CEO of Yahoo demonstrated that even childbirth is possible while you are a CEO. 
Career development policies need to be adjusted or modified to support some of 
the issues faced by females as they try to progress.
Another issue is changing the mindsets of individuals. Previously, men were 
taught to realize the differences between men and women and then ignore them or 
learn to work with them. The more proactive mindset is to understand and manage 
these differences in a way that helps all parties. Finally, showing the business value 
of women in the workplace is critical.
Shifting Families
The structure of families has shifted dramatically in the last two decades. The classic 
nuclear family (a married couple with a small number of children) now represents 
less than 25 percent of families. In 1970, it was at 40 percent.15 Figure 9.6 lists the 
variations of the family and includes all kinds of arrangements, with or without 
children, with or without marriage, and including marriages of the same sex.
Although it may come in different variations, the family is still important, as 
illustrated in a study from the Harvard Medical School. This study, based on the 
lifetime health and happiness of thousands of people, revealed that those who are 
happiest in their lives are not the richest or the most accomplished. Research has 
found consistently that the greatest predictor of lifetime happiness is the extent to 
which people have close friends in their lives, while loneliness is associated with ill 
health. That is why easy, close, relaxed friendships have been described as such a 
key part of human mental health and happiness.16
Also, a study from the Pew Research Center showed that three-­quarters of 
adults (76 percent) say their families are the most important element of their lives. 
Seventy-­five percent say they are very satisfied with their family life, and more than 
eight out of ten say the family they live in now is as close or closer than the family 

168	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
in which they grew up. Interestingly, in this same research, 39 percent said that 
marriage is becoming obsolete.17
The changes in families will mean that organizations will have to provide differ-
ent kinds of support processes and networks for these evolving lifestyles. Work–­life 
balance becomes a critical issue for employees in these family arrangements, and 
considering many of the options that were covered in Chapter 6 may be helpful or 
needed here. Also, the health benefits that are provided can change dramatically 
because the makeup of the family has shifted.
Racial and Ethnic Diversity
The racial and ethnic makeup of organizations has changed dramatically, not only 
in the United States, but in other countries as well. Consider this statistic: the U.S. 
Census Bureau reported that 50.4 percent of children born in a twelve-­month 
period that ended July 2011 were Hispanic, African American, Asian American, or 
from other groups, while non-­Hispanic whites accounted for 49.6 percent of births 
during that period.18
Currently, 30 percent of the U.S. workforce comprises racial or ethnic minori-
ties. It is projected that by 2050 about 50 percent of the workforce will be non-
white. Hispanics have become the largest growing segment of American society. It 
is estimated that there are fifty-­two million Latinos/Hispanics in the United States, 
including Puerto Rico, and that by 2017 Latinos will make up the largest bulk of 
entrants into the workplace. It is also estimated that by 2050 the Latino/Hispanic 
population will represent more than half of the U.S. workforce.
With 50 million, the United States has the second-­largest population of Latinos/
Hispanics in the world, after Mexico’s 108 million. There are more Latinos/Hispanics 
in the United States than there are Canadians in Canada or Spaniards in Spain.19
Rates of migration across countries have also changed dramatically. In 1965, for 
example, 2.5 percent of the world population migrated across borders, representing

about 75 million people. In 2010, the figure was 3 percent, representing about 214 
million people, a much greater percentage of population becoming migrants. Figure 
9.7 shows the racial and ethnic status of the U.S. workforce in 2012 according to the 
U.S. Census Bureau. When compared to the diversity makeup Google released in 
2014, it is easy to see the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics.
While much has been gained in racial and ethnic progress, primarily because 
it has been such an important political and societal issue for many years, there is 
still room for improvement. This is particularly true for business, as people of color 
are underrepresented in many professional and managerial occupations. At the 
same time, people of color also are underrepresented in certain industries, such 
as the high-­tech industry. One approach to correcting this is to constantly remind 
organizations of the business value of a diverse workforce. This is underscored by 
the Center for American Progress, which lists the top ten economic benefits of 
workplace diversity,20 presented in Figure 9.8.

Trust, Happiness, and Work–­Life Balance
The final area to examine involves some interesting and perhaps disturbing trends 
that are evolving with the workforce. First, there is declining trust in institutions of 
all types. For example, we have been bombarded with data on the distrust of poli-
ticians. While this is a problem in almost every country, politicians currently have 
some of the lowest approval ratings in history in the United States. This distrust also 
moves to the leaders in companies. A study by the Davos World Economic Forum 
found that trust in leaders across all organizations is low and declining.21
There is also distrust in news sources and news reporting agencies, as well as 
banks, financial institutions, and stock-­trading firms. There is a particular distrust 
in hospitals, as hospitals have the reputation of being one of the most dangerous 
places to be. This distrust will have to be addressed by organizations, particularly 
when they are working directly in that area.
Another trend is the decline in happiness. As far back as the 1990s, political 
scientist Robert Lane found that happiness had declined in many developing 
countries over the previous decade. Lane and others are trying to understand what 
defines happiness, and it is becoming clear that money or achievements are not 
necessarily what generates happiness. There has been a movement to actually rede-
fine happiness on a national basis.22 This effort is attempting to place more value 
on measures that relate to human development rather than just economic out-
comes. For example, the United Nations measures three basic aspects of quality of 
life to develop a human development index: health and longevity, knowledge, and 
income. When these are adjusted for inequality, they show that the top countries 
in terms of human development are Norway, Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, 
Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, and Slovenia. This is a dramatic 
shift in the idea of what makes a country truly outstanding.
A final issue is the increasing need for work–­life balance. This was mentioned 
previously in this chapter, and Chapter 6 devoted much effort to this topic as well. 
In general, more efforts are needed to address issues around families, work arrange-
ments, commute times, work places, and working hours. These issues have a signif-
icant effect on the happiness and well-­being of employees.
Managing Diversity
This chapter has presented several issues about the diversity of the workforce, and 
this final section brings it all together in terms of how organizations must manage 
them. First, diversity must be defined to reflect all the issues in this chapter.
Global Diversity Definition
Diversity can be defined as a collective mixture characterized by differences and 
similarities that are applied in pursuit of organizational objectives.23 Diversity man-
agement is the process of planning for, organizing, directing, and supporting this 
collective mixture in a way that measurably adds to organizational performance.
Diversity can be organized into four interdependent and sometimes overlapping 
aspects: workforce diversity, behavioral diversity, structural diversity, and business 
and global diversity.

Embrace Demographics and Societal Changes
171
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Workforce diversity encompasses the group and situational identities of the 
organization’s employees (i.e., their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orien-
tation, physical ability, age, family status, economic background and status, and 
geographic background and status). It also deals with changes in the labor-­market 
demographics.
Behavioral diversity encompasses work styles, thinking styles, learning styles, 
communication styles, aspirations, belief/value systems, as well as changes in 
employees’ attitudes and expectations.
Structural diversity encompasses interactions across functions, across organiza-
tional levels in the hierarchy, across divisions and between parent companies and 
subsidiaries, and across organizations engaged in strategic alliances and coopera-
tive ventures. As organizations attempt to become more flexible, less layered, more 
team-­based, and more multi-­ and cross-­functional, measuring this type of diversity 
will require more attention.
Business and global diversity encompasses the expansion and segmentation of 
customer markets, the diversification of products and services offered, and the vari-
ety of operating environments in which organizations work and compete (i.e., legal 
and regulatory contexts, labor-­market realities, community and societal expecta-
tions/relationships, and business cultures and norms). Increasing competitive 
pressures, globalization, rapid advances in product technologies, changing demo-
graphics in the customer bases both within domestic markets and across borders, 
and shifts in business–­government relationships all signal a need to measure an 
organization’s response to and impact on business diversity.
Lawrence Baytos suggested that three Ds have generated widespread corporate 
concern and interest in addressing diversity management issues, whether an orga-
nization has 100 or 100,000 employees. The three Ds are as follows:
•	 Demographics. Females, minorities, and foreign-­born personnel are projected 
to produce 85 percent of the net new growth in the U.S. workforce, while white 
males are fast becoming a minority in the workforce. In 1960, nine out of ten 
U.S. consumers were white. Currently, it is estimated that only six out of ten are 
white. The changing demographics of the workplace are also the changing 
demographics of the marketplace. Organizations are looking at ways to align 
themselves to the new realities of their customer bases.
•	 Disappointment. The traditional U.S. method for handling diversity was to 
bring women and people of color into the workforce under the banner of 
affirmative action. In doing so, it was often assumed that those individuals 
possessed some deficiencies and may not have been hired if not for affirma-
tive action. It was also assumed that they should be willing to minimize their 
differences to better fit the norms of the majority group (usually white males) 
and thereby enhance their opportunities for recognition and advancement. In 
other words, to “make it,” females and people of color would have to leave their 
needs and differences at the organization’s front door. After a little more than 
two decades of affirmative action, it seems clear that this model has resulted in 
females and people of color being trapped in lower levels of the organizational 
pyramid. Turnover, discontent, and underutilization of talent are by-­products 
of using this approach for more than two decades.

172	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Demands. The demands for new approaches to diversity come from employees, 
who have become less willing than their predecessors to minimize their points 
of difference in hopes of gaining the elusive acceptance into the club. Further-
more, the intense pressure of industry and global competition to reengineer 
the organization requires that organizations tap the full potential of all their 
human assets.24
The Phases of Managing Diversity
Figure 9.9 shows the different phases of diversity management and how it has evolved, 
particularly in the United States. As this figure shows, the early efforts in diversity 
were basic experiments of organizations trying to bring in females and people of color. 
Sometimes it was out of necessity, as when a company needed employees, but only 
black employees would take the job. The rationale for inclusion was, “Let’s give this 
a try, and maybe the employees and customers will be satisfied.” The measures were 
simply the number of people in the jobs and the success of those individuals. This was 
the early version of diversity management, before it became a political and legal issue.
When politics got involved and began to force organizations to prevent discrimi-
nation and to take affirmative action to make their workforce mirror the population 
in their particular area, this led to compliance: The point of diversity management 
was to comply with regulations and laws. The measures were the number of people 
in the jobs, recruiting efforts, retention, and complaints. The complaints were all 
varieties from internal complaints to charges, grievances, and even lawsuits. This 
approach worked for some, but it still did not lead to progress for most organiza-
tions, which lead to public pressure to bring attention to these issues. The major 
focus was employing more people of color and females in certain job categories 
and industries, though sometimes these efforts involved physically and mentally 
disadvantaged individuals as well. Companies and organizations often yielded to 
pressure tactics with exposure, and they began to measure diversity management 
in terms of people in jobs, progress made, their image, programs initiated, and 
even the job satisfaction of those in the organization, who often wanted to see an 
employee base more reflective of the general population.

Finally, the most recent phase, which has been evolving for some time, is to 
show the business value of having a diverse workforce—­how diversity improves 
the organization’s effectiveness and efficiency. In this phase, measures of success 
include not only job satisfaction, complaints, absences, and turnover but also pro-
ductivity, quality, and innovation. This is an important milestone, because moving 
in this direction can capture the attention of the executive group. When the issue 
of diversity is presented in terms of business value, most executives will under-
stand that it is important and that they must take action to make it work. They 
see that in addition to it being a legal, ethical, and moral requirement, having a 
diverse and inclusive workforce actually leads to more productivity, better-­quality 
products and services, and more innovation. When this occurs, you really have 
the hearts and souls of the top executives, and this is where diversity management 
has now come.
Building Centers of Diversity Excellence
Diversity management is a critical support to organizations. Learning to serve as a 
strategic partner within the organizational structure is not just a way for diversity 
practitioners to justify their existence or defend their turf. It has implications for 
the very survival of the diversity function and of the organization a whole. If the 
diversity function cannot show that it adds value, it risks being on the table for 
reduction—­or worse, dismantling. With the right diversity mindset and measure-
ment tools, implementing strategic business objectives for diversity can make the 
difference between being an organization that is just keeping pace with the compe-
tition or being one that is making major strides ahead. In essence, it requires cre-
ating centers of diversity excellence, using behavioral and technical measurement 
capability, demonstrating commitment, and building communities of practice to 
sustain it over time.25
In order for an organization to take full advantage of the potential wealth in its 
diversity mixtures, it must completely embrace the level of diversity required to 
meet critical organizational challenges head on. This occurs when organizations 
foster a climate and culture that values differences and maximizes the potential 
of employees through utilization—­in other words, when the organization and the 
individuals within it operate in a mature fashion.
According to Dr. R. Roosevelt Thomas, diversity maturity requires both an 
individual and an organizational set of behaviors that drive success. He states that 
diversity-­mature individuals do the following:
•	 Accept personal responsibility for enhancing their own and their organization’s 
effectiveness.
•	 Demonstrate contextual knowledge (i.e., they know themselves and their orga-
nizations, and they understand key diversity concepts and definitions).
•	 Are clear about requirements and base inclusion/exclusion decisions on how 
differences impact an individual’s ability to meet these requirements.
•	 Understand that diversity is accompanied by complexity and tension and are 
prepared to cope with these in pursuit of greater diversity effectiveness.
•	 Are willing to challenge conventional wisdom.
•	 Engage in continuous learning.

174	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Diversity-­mature individuals see themselves, not others, as responsible for 
addressing diversity effectively. They understand the impact of organizational cul-
ture on diversity-­related practices, but they do not use it as an excuse for inaction 
and indifference.26
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
The material in this chapter clearly points out some great opportunities to improve 
the organization. The human capital strategy should involve several elements. 
These are consistent, for the most part, with what Jean Martin of the Corporate 
Executive Board recommends.27 Develop a global approach to diversity, so that all 
business units are involved, but have local ownership within each unit.
•	 Reward progress made incrementally, and do not base judgment on the final 
outcomes that are desired.
•	 Expand the pool of diverse talent to include sources that are underrepresented 
and most trusted.
•	 Recruit aggressively with the diversity and inclusion targets in mind.
•	 Emphasize the importance of diversity with all of the employee database and 
at different timeframes.
•	 Make sure that diversity programs are aligned to the business needs.
•	 Ensure that high-­performing employees from underrepresented groups are 
placed in leadership roles and are properly supported in those roles.
•	 Minimize, confront, and change the biases in talent management decision 
making.

verywhere we look, technology has rapidly changed and improved in so many dif-
ferent ways. New devices, software, and applications are literally being created daily, 
and their use radically changes organizations, the work that employees do, and the way 
in which employees communicate. This chapter explores the effects of technology in 
terms of learning and other HR functions in the organization. It also addresses many 
of the issues that arise with the proliferation of so many devices and possibilities.
Opening Story: NBC
Employees in many organizations are connected, wired, and tuned with all types of 
devices, apps, and favorite websites. Here is an account of a popular news anchor, 
Brian Williams, of NBC.1 This story was written before he was forced to take a leave of 
absence for changing the facts about an incident in the Iraq War. We think it is still a 
great example of how technology is changing the workplace. Ironically, it was tech-
nology that exposed the contradictions of the incident. Brian Williams was the news 
anchor for the digital age, always plugged in and aware the latest apps and gadgets.
Williams was anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News, television’s 
highest-­rated newscast. With smartphone and table apps for both shows and a big 
Force 8: Technology. One of the most visible forces affecting 
organizations is the changing role of technology. Essentially, tech-
nology doubles its capability and power each year, following a 
concept called Moore’s Law. Advances in technology bring sig-
nificant improvements for organizations in terms of productiv-
ity, quality, time, convenience, and communication, among other 
things. At the same time, some concerns about technology and its 
proper use have evolved, including the critical issue of distracted 
employees. How technology is utilized is an important human 
capital issue, and the chief human resources officer must address 
it in concert with the chief information officer in an organization.

social media presence, Williams was charged with bringing the television news 
audience into the digital age. “It’s a Web-­based job,” different from the days of 
anchors Chet Huntley, David Brinkley, and Tom Brokaw. In those days, if some-
body wrote a letter, there was a two-­ to three-­day delay time. Now, the conversation 
starts after the newscast. The Twitter deck is monitored in the control room as a 
constant conversation. Williams has 160,00 twitter followers but has never tweeted. 
Williams said he doesn’t do Twitter or Facebook because he hasn’t found the time. 
He skips reading social media about himself because he would have no self-­esteem 
and never leave the house.
He is a night owl, cruising various websites, looking for stories for the next day. 
He loves to be challenged by the staff and hates being the only one who brings a find 
to the afternoon story meeting. He follows his favorite websites—­Buzz Feed, Daily 
Mail, and Gawker. Daily Mail is the No. 1 news site in the world, although most of 
it is fluff, once in a while they’ll do a deep dive or gorgeous photos from the Smith-
sonian that will take your breath away. He starts his day with the big aggregators, 
New York Times, the Washington Post, and Politico. He is a nonfiction guy living in 
a nonfiction world.
At the time of the story, viewership was up over the previous year. People know 
they’ll get a thirty-­minute synopsis. The broadcast is old, turning sixty-­five last year; 
however, it’s every bit as vital today as in the past. It provides familiarity and quality, 
a sorting mechanism, a coffee filter to shake everything through.
Brian loves apps such as theBravest (a NYC fire department scanner feed) and 
SkyView (free), which is basically an app that explains the constellations and tracks 
the International Space Station and Hubble Telescope. He receives alerts from a 
great site (and app) called Satellite Flybys ($2.99) when the International Space 
Station is going fly by his ZIP code. He also likes Height Finder (free) to tell you 
what your height is above sea level wherever you are, Google Earth and photo apps 
Color Splash (99 cents) and Snapseed (free).
Most people in TV have twin devices, BlackBerry and iPhone. So many compa-
nies support the BlackBerry, and as many professionals  need the keyboard for the 
constant emailing.
His other devices include a MacBook Pro and a “steam-­powered” Dell both at 
home in the newsroom, wireless Beats by Dr. Dre headphones (“a game changer”) 
and Bose in-­ear headphones. He has an iPad but still is a paper book reader. He 
uses Shazam to find music “constantly” for his iPhone, which has 8,000 songs. His 
all-­time favorite: Bruce Springsteen.
From his view, televisions are getting pretty great and they keep getting greater. 
Give him a NASCAR race on a Sunday afternoon on a fifty-­five-­inch screen and he’s 
happy. The bigger the screen, the better the movie. He won’t watch Raiders of the 
Lost Ark on his iPhone.
Trends in Technology
The use of all types of technology—­devices, software, tools, processes, and 
applications—­has increased at an amazing rate. In 2014, 45 percent of Ameri-
cans had smartphones,2 and there were 1.75 billion smartphone users worldwide. 
Globally, about 4.55 billion people were using mobile phones during the same

year. Between 2013 and 2017, mobile-­phone penetration will rise from 61 percent 
to 64 percent of the global population, according to emarketer.com.3 By 2020, it is 
estimated that there will be 50 billion devices around the globe connected to the 
Internet. A third of them will be computers, smartphones, tablets, and televisions. 
The remaining two-­thirds will be other kinds of things such as sensors, actuators, 
and newly invented intelligent devices that monitor, control, analyze, and optimize 
our world—­the Internet of Things.4 This trend has been decades in the making, but 
it has just now hit a tipping point. Figure 10.1 shows the top ten technology trends 
according to Gartner Research.5 With these trends come some very interesting chal-
lenges and impacts in the organization.
Technology’s Impact on Organizations
We can witness the tremendous impact that technology has had on organizations 
in our daily lives. For example, think about the gas stations where people purchase 
fuel for their cars. One of those chains, called Circle K, has five or six bays available 
for self-­fueling of cars, where probably 95 percent of customers pay electronically. 
One employee manages the quick-­stop store, which has groceries, supplies, and 
various items that automobile passengers may want. In the 1960s, a staff of five or 
six people would service the cars and run the store. Today it is one person.
Sometimes even one individual is not needed. At a fitness chain called Snap Fit-
ness, when customers come to a location to participate in a fitness program, there is 
no one there. The customer uses a card to enter the door, and security cameras mon-
itor everything that takes place. Some call centers are also completely automated, 
with few or no employees. Indeed, we have seen technology completely destroy some 
industries, like the video rental stores such as Blockbuster. Movie theatres may not 
be very far behind.
Productivity
Technology is a boon to many organizations. Improvements are made, tasks are 
much easier and faster to do, and productivity increases. The change can be dra-
matic in terms of how many employees are required to do the work. For example, the 
original Eastman Kodak Company employed forty thousand people at the height of 
its popularity and had a market value of $3 billion. This photograph company had 
existed since 1880. But when a new start up, Instagram, was sold to Facebook for 
about $1 billion in 2012, it had thirty million customers and employed only thirteen 
people. Although the companies are very different, they are both in the business of 
photography. A technology-­based organization will naturally have dramatically less 
employees throughout the process. This dramatic shift has had a profound effect on 
employment levels in the United States.
Figure 10.2 shows what is happening to productivity and employment. In about 
the year 2000, productivity remained robust and growing, while employment basi-
cally tapered off and has continued to decline since. So what we have witnessed in 
the United States is technology rapidly displacing employees in large numbers. In 
a recent study, academics at Oxford University suggest that 47 percent of today’s 
jobs can be automated within the next two decades. Consider the robot created 
by Kiva Systems, a startup that was founded in 2002 and bought by Amazon for 

178	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
$775 million in 2012. A warehouse equipped with Kiva robots can handle up to four 
times as many orders as a similar automated warehouse where human workers may 
spend as much as 70 percent of their time walking around to retrieve goods.6
Other Impacts
In addition to dramatic productivity gains, technology has had an important 
influence on quality. Electronic transactions are much more accurate than human 
Computing Everywhere
As mobile devices continue to proliferate, Gartner predicts an increased emphasis on serving 
the needs of the mobile user in diverse contexts and environments, as opposed to focusing on 
devices alone. The combination of data streams and services created by digitizing everything 
creates four basic usage models—­manage, monetize, operate, and extend.
The Internet of Things
The combination of data streams and services created by digitizing everything creates four basic 
usage models—Manage, Monetize, Operate, and Extend.
3D Printing
3D printing will reach a tipping point over the next three years as the market for relatively 
low-­cost 3D printing devices continues to grow rapidly and industrial use expands significantly.
Context-­Rich Systems
Ubiquitous embedded intelligence combined with pervasive analytics will drive the development 
of systems that are alert to their surroundings and able to respond appropriately.
Smart Machines
Prototype autonomous vehicles, advanced robots, virtual personal assistants, and smart advisors 
already exist and will evolve rapidly, ushering in a new age of machine helpers. The smart machine 
era will be the most disruptive in the history of IT.
Cloud/Client Computing
The convergence of cloud and mobile computing will continue to promote the growth of cen-
trally coordinated applications that can be delivered to any device.
Software-­Defined Applications and Infrastructure
Agile programming of everything from applications to basic infrastructure is essential to enable 
organizations to deliver the flexibility required to make the digital business work.
Web-­Scale IT
Most organizations will begin thinking, acting, and building applications and infrastructure like 
web giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook.
Risk-­Based Security and Self-­Protection
All roads to the digital future lead through security. However, in a digital business world, security 
cannot be a roadblock that stops all progress. Organizations will increasingly recognize that it is 
not possible to provide a 100-­percent-­secured environment.

transactions, and this is why technology has rapidly improved the quality of ser-
vices. When combined with concepts like Six Sigma, large organizations can reduce 
transaction errors to one in nine million transactions, something that would be 
unheard of with human interactions. In addition, the time required to accomplish, 
process, or produce is greatly enhanced. For example, transactions involving the 
creation of one billion gigabytes of data would have taken over a thousand years to 
do using the technology of 2003. But by 2013, this same transaction took only ten 
minutes. This speed translates into all types of services in organizations throughout 
the economy. Because of the gains in productivity and time, technology has also led 
to a direct reduction in the cost of completing tasks.
Impact on Communication and Work Flow
The daily routine of a person in a tech-­savvy world is wired and connected. The day 
may begin with a good-­morning message on a social networking site and end with 
a good night on the same website. Emails, texting, video conferencing, tweeting, 
and other tools and processes may affect every aspect of the day’s work. With the 
use of mobile devices and the Internet for communication, data and conversations 
flow quickly and easy. This connected type of workforce is alive and well in many 
organizations and is a rapidly growing trend in others.7 These devices and pro-
cesses also make it much easier for employees to work from home. As explained 
in Chapter 6, this is an important trend that will continue, thanks to technology.

communicated all over the world at the same time. Employees are sharing their 
screens and chatting online in virtual teams. Good platforms enable employees to 
find the information they need and use it at work quickly, eliminating much of the 
time that was often spent trying to find information and send it to others. When 
using all these tools, however, it is important to take a balanced perspective. In 
Figure 10.3, Google’s human resources director, Dr. Todd Carlisle, describes how 
Google is integrating technology and humanizing it in the workplace.8
• Google employees who rely on one kind of communica	on—for example, tex	ng 
or e-mailing—for everything and never meet with people in person tend to receive 
low engagement scores from their direct reports. Consequently, managers should 
be very thoughul in determining the best way to communicate in every situa	on.
Thoughully mix it up.
• With global organiza	ons, there is o en a need to be online with the individuals 
who are in diﬀerent 	me zones. Technology supports them to make these calls in 
the evenings or early morning to make it convenient for both groups.   It also lets 
them take care of business in conjunc	on with something that is urgent and 
personal.
Let technology support employees in their personal lives.
• Tradi	onally in business, an organiza	on’s policies and procedures were cra ed 
and communicated by people in a Human Resources department, a process that 
excluded much, if any, involvement with line employees. Google sees its workers 
as the true subject maer experts, and purposely makes great use of its shared 
document technology to eliminate all “top-downness from decision making.”
Leverage technologies to give employees a greater voice.
• Almost every mee	ng held today at Google makes use of the Hangout program 
to accommodate employees unable to aend, or who work in other loca	ons.  
Wherever they are, mee	ng aendees are able to use the camera on their phone or 
computer and talk face-to-face with every person par	cipa	ng.
Go high-tech and low-tech.
• If you’ve ever checked email a er waking up at 3 a.m. to go to the bathroom, or felt 
compelled to respond to a boss’s inquiry on a Saturday a ernoon, it’s consoling to 
know that, at least at Google, people are giving thought to whether “always being 
on” is good for us or our organiza	ons.
Encourage people to disconnect.

Social Media
Social media represents an important opportunity and challenge for an organi-
zation. It is an opportunity to make the work much better, smoother, and more 
effective, and it is a great tool for connecting with customers, suppliers, and others 
external to the organization. According to a report in the Harvard Business Review, 
the strategies that are taken with social media often fall into one of four different 
categories, as shown in Figure 10.4.9
The “predictive practitioner” implements social media projects just for specific 
departments or groups, not company-wide or spread over large areas, and only in 
connection to existing business metrics. The “creative experimenter” works with 
social media on a similarly small scale but places less emphasis on predefined out-
comes. The “social media champion” centralizes social media expertise and coordi-
nates social media projects across the whole organization. Finally, the “social media 
transformer” integrates social media into all levels of business strategy and involves 
all stakeholders in the process, both internal and external.
One example of the applications of social media for business is the release of 
the Ford Fiesta automobile, detailed in the same Harvard Business Review report. 
In this release, Ford decided to lend a hundred Fiestas for six months to recipi-
ents who would use social media to discuss their experiences with the cars in an 
authentic, direct way. The company held online contests to select candidates with 
large social media followings. By the end of the six-­month campaign, the drivers 
had posted more than sixty thousand items, which garnered millions of clicks, 
including more than 4.1 million YouTube views. The $5 million campaign created a 
prelaunch brand awareness of 37 percent among millennials, generated fifty thou-
sand sales leads, and prompted thirty-­five thousand test drives. To use traditional 
methods to achieve this success would have cost tens of millions of dollars.
Work Flow
In addition to making sure that people are connected and communicating properly 
using all the networks, devices, and tools, it is helpful to explore how the technology 
actually fits into the flow of the work. Figure 10.5 shows the approach suggested by 
Jacob Morgan in The Future of Work. Morgan’s approach starts with thinking about 
individual values before corporate ones and always putting strategy before the tech-
nology. Too often it goes the other way. The remaining steps ensure that a technology 
is properly organized, executed, and measured as it is integrated in the flow of work.
Impact on Learning
Technology has dramatically changed how we learn at work. Much early training 
followed the traditional “knowledge broadcast” model, with the expert on the stage 
presenting what he knows. Early learning technologies such as projectors, digital 
presentations, and training videos fit this model well.
In the late 1990s, the rise of the Internet gave a huge boost to “digital content.” 
Suddenly, it was much easier to create and share content around the world. This 
led to the growth of two very different types of stakeholders: content special-
ists, who developed and sold learning content in their areas of expertise (e.g.,

Predictive practitioner
Each of our social media projects is owned by a specific functional group or department.
There is little or no cross-­functional coordination among projects.
Each project has a clear business objective.
We can measure each project’s impact with existing metrics.
Creative experimenter
Our overall objective is to learn from our social media projects.
In particular, we aim to enable engagement and to listen and learn from resulting conversations.
We positon our projects as experiments within discrete functions or departments.
We are not overly concerned with predefining outcomes.
Social media champion
We have a centralized group and specific leaders dedicated to coordinating and managing 
social medial projects across departments and functions.
This centralized group develops policies and guidelines for social media use.
We enlist executive champions and other evangelists, including external influencers, to pro-
mote and participate in our projects.
We share best practices and lessons learned from various projects throughout the 
organization.
Social media transformer
Our portfolio of social media projects involves both internal employees and external stake-
holders, such as customers and business partners.
Our social media technologies are tightly integrated with how we learn and work.
Our projects typically encompass multiple functions and departments.
We have centralized groups tasked with thinking about how social media can inform our 
business strategy and culture in light of surprises and emerging trends.

financial management), and systems specialists, who developed learning plat-
forms or learning management systems (LMSs), which allowed companies to 
deliver online learning to employees around the world at any time.
Broadly, this was a success. Companies were putting more and more of their 
training online and were able to reach an increasingly diverse group of learners. 
The next ten years were vibrant days for learning technologists, with companies 
investing heavily in e-­learning, excited by the potential cost savings of no more face-­
to-­face training. During this time, hundreds of new e-­learning companies formed, 
merged, and were acquired. Digital content became commoditized and was increas-
ingly bought in segments, either by the hour or by the amount of content. However, 
there was little regard for the quality of the learning itself. Unfortunately, as with 
many new technologies, a large number of overly enthusiastic training departments 
forged ahead with this technology trend and mistakenly thought that some badly 
developed e-­learning courses would somehow be as effective as expert face-­to-­face 
training sessions—­they were not!

From the mid-­2000s, the e-­learning market started to mature with the addi-
tion of three new ideas and associated technologies: talent management systems; 
increased use of blended learning; and virtual classrooms, video streaming, and 
collaboration tools. Figure 10.6 shows the various innovations in e-­learning.
Most would agree that any large expenditure in an organization should in some 
way be connected to business success. Even in nonbusiness settings, large invest-
ments should connect to organizational measures of output, quality, cost, and 
time—­classic measure categories of hard data that exist in any type of organization. 
In a review of articles, reports, books, and blogs about learning through technology, 
the emphasis is on making a business connection.10 For example, in the book Learn-
ing Everywhere: How Mobile Content Strategies Are Transforming Training (2012), 
Chad Udell makes the case for connecting mobile learning to businesses measures. 
He starts by listing the important measures that are connected to the business. A 
sampling is shown in Figure 10.7.
Udell goes on to say that mobile learning should connect to any of these, and he 
takes several measures step by step to show how, in practical and logical thinking, 
a mobile-­learning solution can drive any or all these measures. He concludes by 
suggesting that if an organization is investing in mobile learning or any other type 
of learning, it needs to connect the investment to these business measures. Other-
wise, it shouldn’t be pursued. This dramatic call for accountability is not unusual.
Impact on HR
The technology that has been integrated into HR has evolved over several decades. 
When considering how deeply technology has impacted the HR process, it is help-
ful to think of HR as being composed of two broad types of work: The first type is 
transactional work, and the second type is advice and execution work. Obviously, 
the transaction work has great potential for automation, but even the advice and 
execution work can be enhanced and augmented by technology.
	 1.	 Focus on individual values before corporate values.
	 2.	 Strategy always comes before technology.
	 3.	 Learn to get out of the way.
	 4.	 Lead by example.
	 5.	 Listen to the voice of the employee.
	 6.	 Integrate technology into the flow of work.
	 7.	 Create a supportive environment.
	 8.	 Measure what matters.
	 9.	 Be persistent.
	10.	 Adapt and evolve.
	11.	 Understand that employee collaboration also benefits the customer.
	12.	 Accept that collaboration makes the world a better place.

Better Leaders, and Create a Competitive Organization. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2014.

Mobile Learning
Much hyped but only moderately understood, mobile learning involves mobile devices woven 
into a learning or training scenario. Often, but not always, the learners themselves are mobile.
Game-­Based Learning
Game-­based learning has been described as the next big thing for the past ten years. Two inter-
esting and more successful models of this have emerged:
•	
Playing a real game, designed for entertainment, but setting challenges within it that build on 
learning.
•	
Doing real learning tasks, but using a badge system to show progress and gains. Mozilla’s 
Open Badges framework offers good tools for this.
Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD)
BYOD refers to initiatives that allow employees to use their own personal mobile technology 
devices at work as part of their day.
Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)
A MOOC is a web-­based course, often free, designed to offer learning to many thousands of stu-
dents at the same time. Although they have been around since 2008, they have received a lot of 
attention since 2012, thanks to recent backing from some notable schools (Stanford, Princeton, 
and MIT, for example) and high-­profile start-­ups.
Flipped Classroom
If so much information is available online, and quality time with an expert facilitator is hard to 
find, why waste the time you have together by sitting quietly in your chair and listening to a lec-
ture? It is far better, perhaps, to watch the recorded lecture before you come into class and then 
spend the face-­to-­face time discussing it, asking questions, and doing activities.

Prior to 1990, automation was very small scale, limited by the computer power 
that was available at the time. Much of the work was, essentially, done in a word-­
processing format. Many organizations around this time began to change their label 
from personnel to human resources. From 1990 to 2000, human resources evolved 
and the personal computer made processing much easier, and automation became a 
big part of employee records, benefits administration, and so forth. This decade also 
brought saw enterprise-­wide human resources information systems for the HR staff.
From 2001 to 2010, talent management evolved and a variety of platforms and 
tools were created to help the organizations recruit, develop, track, and monitor 
talent. Many tools and processes were automated and connected to focus on the 
critical part of the organization. From 2011 on, the focus has been using the latest 
tools to not only facilitate the administrative transactional processes but help show 
the value of the human resources function using big data, predictive analytics for 
forecasting, and prescriptive statistics—­all aimed at making the HR function more 
efficient and effective.11
Technology has radically changed all the classic functions of HR, from recruit-
ing, which is now highly automated through e-­recruiting, to benefits and compen-
sation processing. Transactional processes have been automated, outsourced, or 
moved to other parts of the organization. Much of on-­boarding and learning and 
development have been shifted to blended learning, e-­learning, or mobile learning, 
as described earlier.
Issues with Technology
Technology can create problems if not properly addressed. There are many well-­
known examples of such issues, and they are often collectively referred to as the 
dark side of technology, which creates problems on the day-­to-­day scale of the work-
place and the broader strategic scale of the organization.
Workplace
The first workplace issue is the concept of being always connected. Sometimes 
employees are expected to be on call at all times, constantly plugged into their 
devices. They are now on the job twenty-­four hours a day, seven days a week. The 
stress from these extended hours might cancel out the benefits of the technology. 
Many organizations are establishing policies to discourage or prevent this situation. 
Some countries, such as Brazil and the Netherlands, have laws prohibiting sending 
business emails at night unless the employees are being paid for it. Indeed, part of 
the problem with emails is often the overwhelming number of them, with many 
employees receiving two to three hundred emails a day. The issue here is having an 
effective email policy and preparing individuals to manage their email.
Another issue is privacy, a concern for all employees, particularly with so many 
devices at work. A survey conducted by Harris Interactive involving 2,100 adults 
showed that 99 percent of users are now concerned about their online privacy.12 Fig-
ure 10.8 shows their various levels of concern for particular online platforms. Privacy 
will continue to be a huge issue as employee’s emails, personal material, informa-
tion, and ID numbers such as social security numbers may be obtained by others.

186	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Another challenge is using all the devices properly and efficiently. With so many 
new devices available, with so many apps, significant portions of time may be lost 
exploring new possibilities, trying to get current devices to work, trying to decide 
what was needed, or trying to locate the information that was desired. This problem 
is amplified by the need to stay abreast of what is available.
The issue that causes the most concern is the loss of focus and attention in an 
ever-­connected environment. The constant connection to technology causes people 
to lose social interaction, and it requires multitasking. Many studies have shown 
that multitasking increases the occurrence of errors, which can be disastrous. This 
is particularly critical when there is a need for individuals to put down their mobile 
devices and have a face-­to-­face discussion. In some cases, people have become 
addicted to technology, which can give way to many personal and social problems.
Finally, there is the issues of technology abuse, as employees use their tools and 
devices for personal activities, lowering their contribution and productivity for the 
organization. All these issues will have to be managed properly through the human 
capital strategy to ensure success.
Organization
As mentioned earlier, job losses from productivity improvements represent a prob-
lem for organizations. Many organizations take pride in being labeled a great place 
to work, and they work hard to try to avoid having to lay off their employees when 
there is a needed reduction because of productivity improvement. For example, 
when a warehouse switches from people to robots, what are the implications for the 
employees that are being displaced? Although sometimes technology is integrated 
slowly and normal attrition can take care of it, there are times when many employ-
ees are suddenly no longer needed.

From a social perspective, an outstanding employer is one that is not only prof-
itable and sustainable over a period of time but also a company that actually creates 
jobs. When companies have that goal, they can use displaced employees in very cre-
ative ways. They can be redirected to take care of growth, involved in other projects, 
or trained for other occupations that are needed. A variety of possibilities exist, and 
this perhaps is the biggest challenge that arises from the impact of technology—­
how to deal with zero or even negative job growth. This becomes quite noticeable 
when companies go through mergers. The total employment, for example, in the 
pharmaceutical industry has been declining because of mergers and consolidations 
of the different pharmaceutical companies. While this is helpful for the balance 
sheet, it is not good for growing economies.
Another issue is intrusion into systems and databases. Cybersecurity is one of 
the most talked-­about areas in technology, and if not properly addressed, the results 
can be devastating to an organization. For example, the hacking of Target’s database 
of customers and credit card numbers had a very negative effect on the company.13 
Not only did some executives lose jobs, but the brand and image of the company 
declined. Share prices declined, and revenue declined as well. Ultimately, this led 
to fewer employees, at least for the short term. This is only one of many examples 
that are routinely occurring. The challenge is to not only prevent the attacks but 
also have mechanisms in place to properly deal with them.
The velocity of change is another issue that affects organizations, as there are so 
many different technology options. Among the top challenges for chief information 
officers is simply trying to understand what is available, what is necessary, and what 
will work.
Finally, the last issue is the need to show the business value of technology. Many 
technology implementations go astray and do not add the value that was antici-
pated. Overall, the IT function has not stepped up to the issue of showing the value 
of technology investments, particularly before they invest. This is a huge problem 
for many.
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
The human capital strategy needs to address the technology issues covered in this 
chapter. It needs to be developed in concert with the chief information officer, chief 
technology officer, or another appropriate head of technology in the organization. 
Ideally, the strategy should address these six areas:
•	 The use of technology in terms of the systems, processes, tools, and platforms 
at the worksite along with ways to ensure that they are used properly and 
protected.
•	 The use of social media and how it should be protected. Some organizations do 
not allow employees to have access to Facebook at work, while others use it in 
their work. The strategy may be controversial either way, but the issue must be 
addressed to take into consideration productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness, 
while also making the organization a great place to work at the same time.
•	 The consequences of productivity improvements caused by technology 
enhancement. Although these improvements are needed and desired to have 

188	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy

an efficient and effective organization, there is also a need to ensure that 
employees are not always dismissed when they become redundant. Employ-
ees may be trained for other assignments, helped through the transition, or 
assigned to other projects—­all to make sure that the total employment doesn’t 
necessarily decline. This is approached in the spirit of having a company that 
is not only profitable and sustainable but one that generates job growth.
•	 A cybersecurity policy that not only protects databases and the privacy of data 
from employees, customers, and suppliers but includes a mechanism to control 
and minimize the impact of cyberattacks.
•	 The alignment of technology to business needs before adoption. If a clear line 
of sight to business measures cannot be determined, then perhaps the tech-
nology is not needed.
•	 The evaluation of major projects all the way to impact and ROI level, showing 
that the technology is working and is adding business value.

his chapter describes the phenomenon known as globalization, which has had 
both positive and negative impacts on most organizations around the world. 
Globalization affects organizations directly in terms of selling goods and services 
to international markets, outsourcing work to other countries, or insourcing work 
from other countries. It has an effect on the pricing of products, the flow of capital 
and investments, and more important, it has an important impact on employment, 
job creation, inequality, and environment degradation, among other things. This 
chapter defines globalization, how it affects countries around the world, and how 
it affects organizations. Next, it describes how multinational companies become 
global in the first place. Most start off very small and eventually evolve into global 
powerhouses by passing through phases described in this chapter. The chapter ends 
with how globalization has affected the human resources function and the implica-
tions for human capital strategy.
Opening Stories
K’Nex
As every American child knows, toys come from the North Pole—­or more likely, 
China. But K’Nex Brands LP, a family-­owned company in this Philadelphia suburb, 
is trying to prove they can still be made in America.1
Force 9: Globalization. The international integration of 
goods, technology, labor, and capital is everywhere to be seen. 
Globalization has had tremendous impacts on countries and 
organizations. No medium-­ to large-­size organization has 
escaped the effect, either positive or negative, of globalization. 
The challenge is for organizations to take advantage of the 
positive aspects of globalization and prepare for the negative 
consequences of globalization. This is best achieved through 
the development of human capital strategy.

Over the past few years, K’Nex has brought most of the production of its plastic 
building toys back to its factory in Hatfield from subcontractors in China. To make 
that possible, the company has redesigned some of the toys and even handed over 
to kids a bit of the assembly formerly performed by hand in China.
“In the long term, it’s much better for us to manufacture here,” says Joel Glickman, 
chairman of K’Nex and its manufacturing affiliate, Rodon Group. The two companies 
have combined sales of more than $100 million, making them small players compared 
with American rivals Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc., neither of which has announced 
plans to shift production to the U.S. By moving production closer to U.S. retailers, 
K’Nex said it can react faster to the fickle shifts in toy demand and deliver hot-­selling 
items to stores faster. It also has greater control over quality and materials, often a 
crucial safety issue for toys. And as wages and transport costs rise in China, the 
advantages of producing there for the U.S. market are waning.
But K’Nex has found it impossible so far to produce 100 percent U.S.-­made toys, 
the firm’s goal. The K’Nex experience shows both the attractions of “reshoring” 
production and the difficulties of making that happen.
Lining up suppliers has been a complicated chore in the U.S. where toy-­making 
skills have faded. China, by contrast, has a vast, efficient network of suppliers and 
skilled labor. “In China, you can go over with just a drawing and say, ‘I need a mil-
lion of these,’” says Michael Araten, chief executive of K’Nex. That helps account 
for a huge U.S. deficit in the toy trade. In 2012, U.S. imports of toys, games, and 
sporting goods, mostly from China, totaled $33.5 billion, or about three times U.S. 
exports of such items. The roots of K’Nex go back to 1956, when Irving Glickman 
set up a small factory to make plastic items, such as protective caps for chair legs. 
In the early 1990s, his son, Joel, invented K’Nex toys to diversify the product line. 
By the late 1990s, K’Nex was following the fashion among U.S. companies of mov-
ing production to China. The affiliated Rodon Company continued to make such 
items as plastic window parts and coffee filters, requiring little manual labor at 
the Hatfield factory.
When the U.S. economy slumped in 2008, demand for products made by Rodon 
fell so sharply that the company couldn’t keep all its workers busy. To avoid major 
layoffs, the Glickman family decided to begin moving production of the K’Nex toys 
back to Hatfield.
The Glickmans were confident that Rodon, whose slogan is “Cheaper Than 
China,” could use its highly automated processes to mold plastic parts at a com-
petitive cost. The challenge was that making K’Nex toys also involves manual labor, 
which is still much more costly in the U.S.
Toys had to be reimagined in some cases. K’Nex roller-­coaster tracks were held 
together with metal pins, inserted by hand in China. The company redesigned the 
tracks so they could snap together. A tiny hubcap for K’Nex car wheels used to be 
attached by workers in a Chinese factory. Now it is included as a separate part in 
K’Nex kits, and children who get the toy have one more piece to snap into place.
Last year, K’Nex took over production and sales of Tinkertoys under license from 
Hasbro, which used to make them in China. Tinkertoys, a century-­old product, were 
originally made of wood and later included both wood and plastic parts. To reduce 
costs and make U.S. production economical. K’Nex last year switched to plastic for 
the remaining wooden spokes.

K’Nex also makes Lincoln Logs, likewise under license from Hasbro. It considered 
transforming them to plastic, but research showed the public wasn’t ready for plastic 
log cabins. So K’Nex continues to have the logs made in china, though Mr. Araten 
hopes to find a U.S. furniture company to produce the tiny logs in America.
K’Nex still imports small battery-­powered motors for its toys from China because 
it hasn’t found a competitive U.S. supplier. Also still imported from China is the head 
of the Angry Bird toy that requires a rubberized coating that would be expensive 
to replicate in the U.S.
To increase U.S. content, K’Nex has had to make compromises. Joseph Smith, 
the chief development officer at K’Nex, points to a little car with a shiny metallic fin-
ish that zips around on one of the company’s roller coasters. The car’s silvery finish is 
“a neat look,” Mr. Smith says, but the process used to apply the coating is “expensive, 
it’s dirty, and we can’t do it here, so we designed it out of the product.” Instead of the 
shiny coating, K’Nex may supply decals, to be applied by the cars’ owners.
K’Nex is getting kudos for its made-­in-­U.S.A. efforts. President Obama paid a 
visit to the Hatfield plan in November 2012. Total employment at K’Nex and Rodon 
has grown to about 200 people from 150 four years ago. Wages at the nonunion 
plant range from about $12 an hour for the least skilled machine operators to more 
than twice that.
K’Nex recently bought a $30,000 Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics Inc., Bos-
ton. For now, Baxter is performing simple packaging tasks. Eventually, Mr. Araten 
hopes that more sophisticated versions of the robot will help K’Nex move more 
assembly work back to the U.S.
ROI Institute
The ROI Institute, founded in 1993, is a global leader in measurement and evalua-
tion with the emphasis on measuring the return on investment in noncapital invest-
ments. Based in the United States, this small organization has grown incrementally 
to the point where most of its revenues are now derived from partners located 
abroad. The company has employees and independent contractors in the United 
States as well as international partners. The company delivers consulting services, 
showing the impact and ROI of many types of projects and programs. Workshops 
and ROI certification are also offered to build capability inside organizations. The 
target audiences are human resources, technology, marketing, and quality assur-
ance functions. The types of organizations vary considerably, with about half of 
the market made up of businesses and the other half comprising governments, 
nongovernmental organizations, universities, and nonprofits. The ROI institute 
delivers services and products around five competencies:
	 1.	 Consulting directly with organizations in the form of impact/ROI studies
	 2.	 Teaching individuals to evaluate their own projects and programs
	 3.	 Documenting successes of ROI analysis through books, articles, case studies, 
and blog posts
	 4.	 Conducting research to understand the successes and the opportunities 
available
	 5.	 Speaking to groups to explain the need for this level of accountability and how 
the process works

192	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
From the very beginning, the ROI Institute wanted to operate globally, perceiv-
ing that the need for these products and services exist in every country and culture. 
The first assignment was in South Africa, the second in Malaysia, and the third in 
Canada. Since then, the company has placed a premium on working across borders, 
initially through offices in Europe and Asia but now through partners situated in 
thirty-­five countries and serving a total of sixty countries. These partners operate 
much like franchisees and offer the same products and services to their countries.
When considering the issues of globalization, it is helpful to assess the impact of 
the ROI Institute along several dimensions. Although it is a small enterprise, when 
this impact is multiplied by the literally millions of other small enterprises, it is easy 
to see how even small organizations can drive globalization.
Regarding trade, the ROI Institute began by selling its services outside the United 
States, and it migrated to selling them through partners, so that the transactions flow 
from the home headquarters to different countries. Now there is even more trading 
across borders as a partner in one country applies the same process in another.
Regarding global consciousness, the ROI Institute attempts to customize its 
services based on the context, culture, and language of the customers. Instead of 
merely translating books (although the books have been translated into thirty-­eight 
languages), the institute prefers to coauthor a book with a partner, bringing the 
culture, context, and examples from that country into the marketplace.
The ROI Institute’s employment has grown each year of its existence. Although 
the number of employees and contractors in the United States is still around fifty, 
external growth has been more impressive. In the last ten years, the partnerships have 
grown from twenty to thirty-­five, collectively employing seventy full-time individuals. 
Jobs were created in all involved countries, and no jobs were lost in the process.
Regarding financial flows, revenue flows into the United States from different part-
ners, and various procurements are made abroad, causing revenue to flow from the 
United States to the different countries as well. Travel, scheduled routinely with the exec-
utives of the ROI Institute, is adding to the revenues of different hotels and airlines 
outside the United States. A software company based in Amsterdam has developed 
software for this process, so there is also a flow of investment into the Netherlands.
In terms of prosperity, the jobs created are high-­wage jobs, and in most countries 
they are in the upper tier of the wage scale. In addition, the business model of the ROI 
Institute is to provide a process through which organizations can become more effec-
tive and efficient, which contributes to the economies of their respective countries.
Regarding mobility, some partners have moved across borders to work with the 
ROI methodology, and two people have transferred to the United States to work at 
the ROI Institute headquarters.
These two examples of K’Nex and the ROI Institute show how globalization is 
working. In the first example, a medium-­size manufacturing organization is strug-
gling with globalization and reversing previous moves of outsourcing to relocate 
production back to the United States. This is in response to a problem that has 
occurred with globalization as more jobs have been outsourced from the United 
States than have been created through this process. The second example shows how 
a small business can be a global organization as well and benefit from global trade. 
The success of the ROI Institute is, for the most part, based on its work outside the 
United States, although it has a large domestic presence.

While we could have featured large multinational organizations in the opening 
stories, such as Nike, McDonalds, or Coca-­Cola, it is helpful to see how globaliza-
tion is affecting the majority of organizations, which are small to medium in size.
Defining Globalization
Globalization has different meanings depending on who you ask, but its presence 
is very obvious. In any large city, in any country, Japanese and German cars are in 
the streets. An email or text message can arrange a purchase of products on another 
continent. Most local businesses around the world could not function without com-
puters assembled in other countries or the Internet that connects them. In many 
countries, foreign nationals have taken over a large segment of service industries. 
Over the past twenty years, foreign trade and cross-­border movement of technology, 
labor, and capital have been massive and irresistible. During the same period, in 
the advanced industrial countries, the demand for skilled workers has increased 
at the expense of less skilled workers, and the income gap between the groups has 
grown. Globalization is a force that commands much attention, and it is in the news 
almost every day.
One definition of globalization comes from Wikipedia: “Globalization is the 
process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, 
products, ideas, and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and tele-
communications infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and its posterity 
and the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdepen-
dence of economic and cultural activities.”2
Other examples are also available:
•	 “Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide social 
relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are 
shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa.” (Anthony Glid-
dens, former director of the London School of Economics)
•	 “Globalization may be thought of as a process (or set of processes) which embodies 
a transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—­
assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity, and impact—­generating 
transcontinental or interregional flows and networks of activity, interaction, and 
the exercise of power.” (David Held, professor of politics and international rela-
tions, Durham University)
•	 “Globalization as a concept refers both to the compression of the world and the 
intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole.” (Roland Robertson, 
emeritus professor of sociology, University of Aberdeen, Scotland)3
Along with the different twists in the definitions, there are both supporters 
and critics. In almost any dimension, there are proponents of globalization who 
see the positive aspects and ignore the downsides. Then there are critics that focus 
on the downsides and miss much of the positive aspects of globalization. The reality 
is that globalization has both positive and negative outcomes. Globalization is not 
a new phenomenon. It started with the very beginning of civilization as the first 
humans migrated from the African continent to all the other continents in the 

194

world. Even after most human settlements became fixed, trade between territories 
began and people continued to migrate from one continent to another. The process 
has evolved over time; some would argue that it is inevitable. The first major push 
for globalization in the modern era occurred with the easing of tariffs and the 
promotion of trade at a conference organized by the United States near the end of 
World War II in the New England town of Bretton Woods. Under the leadership 
of the United States and Great Britain, the major allied economic powers agreed 
to make some changes in their protectionist policies. This ultimately led to a treaty 
called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947. In 1995, the 
World Trade Organization was founded to continue to address trade issues. All 
types of organizations have continued to work at making globalization a reality.
Table 11.1 shows the various elements of the globalization process with both the 
supporters’ view and the critics’ view. For each dimension, it is probably easy for you to 
see the importance of the issue. Indeed, the critics’ view is sometimes a painful reality 
that most can relate to. In almost every study, there are inconclusive or conflicting 
results. It is a fact that there is more trade thanks to globalization, and that more 
people have access to products and services. Some wages have increased, and many 
jobs have been created. On the downside, things have not always worked to benefit 
everyone involved, and the remainder of this chapter examines some of the key issues 
involved in the formal globalization process since its beginnings in the 1940s.
Table 11.1.  The globalization debate.
Issue
Supporters’ view
Critics’ view
Social inter-
dependence
Growing economic interdependence 
leads to social interdependence. Social 
processes are leading to more global 
integration.
There is no empirical data that confirms 
this. People do not feel a part of a global 
family.
Poverty
More people will move out of poverty 
in the least-­developed countries. Free 
markets lead to jobs, more wages, and 
lower consumer prices.
The reduction of poverty has largely 
occurred in China and India, through 
their economic policies and growth 
and by shifting production and service 
facilities out of developed countries.
Employment Employment in the least-­developed 
countries will increase and the 
employment in developed countries 
will also increase as the demand for 
goods and services increase.
There is little evidence that employment 
has increased in the least-­developed 
countries because of globalization. In 
the developed countries, employment 
growth is stagnant.
Prosperity
Globalization makes the world’s people 
more prosperous. The purchasing 
power for the least-­developed 
countries will improve. Household 
incomes will improve.
The least-­developed countries have 
become poorer. The bottom billion are 
losing ground and are highly unstable.
Inequality
Globalization should reduce the gap 
between the rich and poor.
Since 2010, household income in the poorest 
half of the world has decreased. The top 
eighty billionaires have more wealth than 
the bottom half of the world’s population 
combined (3.5 billion people).

Issue
Supporters’ view
Critics’ view
Global 
integration
More people are integrated into the 
global capitalist economy—­more than 
90 percent of the world’s population 
since the 1990s.
The global capitalist economy is dominated 
by the rich members of the Organisa-
tion for Economic Co-­operation and 
Development (OECD).
Global trade More global trade than ever before is 
occurring. Reduction in air travel 
and shipping costs has facilitated a 
significant expansion of cross-­border 
trade.
Most trade is not global but takes place 
regionally. International trade has not 
increased dramatically since the twen-
tieth century. In the least-­developed 
countries, the share of world trade 
decreased by 50 percent.
Global 
financial 
markets
Growth in global financial markets and 
the global circulation of currency 
will boost the economies of the 
least-­developed countries
Capital outflows are mainly short-­term 
speculative investments, not productive 
investments. The increasing volatility 
of financial flows helped to create the 
global financial crisis in 2008.
Mobility
Increased mobility of people creates a 
more migrant labor force around the 
globe.
Most people stay home, and most labor is 
not mobile.
Environment Globalization will create new sustainable 
energy innovations and foster a 
willingness to comply with planetary 
sustainability goals.
The earth’s environmental decline has been 
unprecedented. The effects of overcon-
sumption and population growth have been 
disastrous, with food shortages, extinction 
of species, and excessive pollution.
Global 
companies
A new type of global company has been 
created with products, employees, 
R&D, and shareholders all over the 
world.
Most multinational companies retain 
national management, R&D, and 
investments. They are more imperialistic 
than truly global.
Global 
conscious
There has been an intensification of 
global consciousness. People are 
becoming global thinkers.
Although there is more global awareness, 
there is no shared cosmopolitan 
consciousness.
Nation 
states
A “borderless” world will be created 
where political power is located 
in global formations and global 
networks—­not in territorially based 
states. Nation states will lose their 
dominant role in the global economy.
Territory still matters. Conventional 
political units are still relevant. Local 
political decisions control global 
economic activities and policies.
Control
No one is in charge of globalization. It 
cannot be dominated by only one 
nation.
The United States is the strongest 
economic and military power, and the 
largest global organizations are based in 
America. The substance and direction 
of globalization are shaped by American 
domestic and foreign policy.

The Impact of Globalization on Countries
Referring to Table 11.1, it is helpful to understand some of the issues in a little more 
detail to see how they affect countries and organizations. It is easy to see why trade 
is a critical beginning point. Prior to the efforts in the 1940s, international trade was 
very difficult and expensive. The bureaucracy, documentation, and tariffs involved 
made trade almost impossible in some countries, but with the treaty developments 
of the last century, trade has become much easier. Tariffs have been reduced and 
sometimes completely removed for some items. However, because of the recent 
global financial crisis, some tariffs have been reinforced or reinstated, reversing 
some of the earlier trends.
Global financial markets were created to make it easy for money to flow across 
borders into all types of organizations. The International Monetary Fund was created 
to ease some of the issues on money flows and investments and provide assistance and 
support where necessary. In addition, the World Bank was created to help the least-­
developed countries. Foreign investment into countries was promoted and increased 
to the point where it became a critical issue with many organizations. Almost every 
country wants foreign investment, not just for job creation, but also for gains in pro-
ductivity, advanced manufacturing techniques, research and development—­and con-
sequently, higher wages. Even the highly industrialized and developed nations are 
very eager to capture foreign direct investment.
For example, in 2014, for the first time, foreign investment in China exceeded 
foreign investment in the United States. In fact, the investment in the United States 
was only slightly more than the investment in Singapore. Table 11.2 shows the top 
destinations for foreign investment in 2014. The problem is that direct investment is 
not occurring in the least-­developed countries, at least not enough to create enough 
jobs to bring them out of poverty. An obvious reason is that these countries are often 
unstable and deteriorating, making them unattractive targets for investors.

Employment is the term that is most often used in connection with globalization. 
There has been tremendous job growth in India and China, as many manufactur-
ing and service industries have outsourced an enormous amount of work, creating 
jobs and raising the wages in those countries. For the same reason, job creation 
has been relatively flat in the United States and the European Union. This creates 
issues for politicians and policy makers. Table 11.3 shows the effect of globalization 
on unemployment trends and projections. Total unemployment is increasing, as the 
unemployment rate is projected to be fairly stable through 2018. This means that 
not enough jobs are being created to keep up with population growth.
The environment is an area where globalization was once thought to have a pos-
itive impact. The assumption was that having products and services cross borders 
could help organizations in the least-­developed countries become more efficient, 
reduce their pollution, and moderate their effects on the environment. It was also 
thought that through a global community, there would be pressure on the primary 
culprits who are destroying the environment to actually improve their practices. 
This has not happened as expected. Figure 11.1 shows the consequences of global 
environmental degradation caused in part by the globalization effort.4 More specif-
ically, in terms of the total emissions of carbon dioxide, China remains the biggest 
culprit, followed closely by the United States, India, and the Russian Federation. 
However, on a per capita basis, the United States is much worse than China. Glo-
balization’s effect on the environment is a serious problem, as we have consistently 
seen the destruction of biodiversity, food shortages, unusual weather patterns, and 
the general warming of the climate. This is perhaps one of the most serious issues 
that we have to address as a global community.
Finally, regarding poverty and inequality, globalization is not working as it 
should be. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. A recent 
Table 11.3.  Global unemployment trends and projections, 2003–20­18.

report from Oxfam shows that the richest 1 percent is likely to control half of all 
global wealth by the end of 2015.5 In 2014, the eighty wealthiest billionaires in the 
world all together had $1.9 trillion in wealth, nearly the same amount shared by 
the 3.5 billion people who occupy the bottom half. The year before, it had taken 
eighty-­five billionaires to equal that figure. The same report indicates that there are 
more than 1 billion people who live on less than $1.25 per day. The reality is that the 
bottom billion people are getting poorer, while the upper 1 percent is getting richer. 
These serious issues show the downside of globalization.
The Impact of Globalization on Organizations
Just as globalization affects countries and the global community as a whole, it also 
affects individual organizations as they participate in globalization. There are five 
important issues beyond the impacts described in the previous section.

Confront Globalization

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
The first issue is pricing strategies. When work from highly developed coun-
tries is outsourced to less-­developed countries, it can be performed much cheaper. 
For the most part, this is passed onto the consumer with lower prices. To remain 
competitive, organizations have to meet those low prices, which means either find-
ing efficiencies to lower costs or participating in the same type of outsourcing. In 
addition, consumers can easily compare prices using the Internet—­in some cases, 
instantaneously on their mobile devices. Globalization has a tendency to take pric-
ing out of the mix, constantly driving prices down or at least keeping them under 
control and very near to the competition. This makes more products and services 
available to consumers, including in some of the least-­developed countries. At the 
same time, it places pressure on companies to increase efficiency and effectiveness. 
Only the strong and determined survive in this kind of environment.
The second issue is trade. Imports and exports are always critical for a country. 
In an ideal situation, a country exports more than it imports. But many countries 
are out of balance, and it becomes a major problem when trade is severely out of 
balance. The goal for all is to develop more goods and services and trade them all 
over the world. The challenge is to make sure they flow in the right direction for a 
given country.
The third issue is foreign direct investment, which is important as companies 
seek assistance to invest in another country. For example, incentives are often pro-
vided to attract investments. In a highly developed country like the United States, 
lucrative incentives are provided to foreign companies to build plants and service 
facilities—­sometimes excessive enticements. To try to balance this and encourage 
foreign direct investment into the least-­developed countries, assistance and support 
is provided through organizations such as the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund.
The fourth issue is employment, the globalization issue affecting organizations 
the most. The definition of a good employer is one that not only keeps jobs but 
creates jobs, while becoming more efficient and profitable so that they can be sus-
tained over a period of time. To increase efficiency and profitability while creating 
jobs is difficult, but some of the best are doing it. The challenge is to ensure that 
globalization does not have an adverse impact on the right kind of job growth.
In theory, when a massive number of jobs are relocated to another country, 
new jobs will be created in the outsourcing country that will be higher skilled and 
higher paid. For example, in the United States, the textile industry has mostly been 
relocated to Asia, displacing millions of Americans from textile employment. It 
was assumed that these people would move into other jobs or be trained for higher 
paying jobs. This has not happened in many cases, creating real problems for unem-
ployment. As of 2015, the U.S. unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, but some argue 
that the real employment rate is more than 12 percent because so many people are 
underemployed. There are many stories about waiters with bachelor’s degrees, taxi 
drivers with PhDs, and landscapers with engineering degrees. These individuals do 
not appear in the official unemployment rolls because they are not drawing unem-
ployment benefits. Nevertheless, they are victims of a massive but hidden problem 
called underemployment.
The fifth issue is inequality—­an issue for countries, but also an issue for compa-
nies. For the United States as a whole, Figure 11.2 shows the lowest income of the top 

200	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
5 percent compared to the highest income of the bottom 20 percent, as well as the 
mean household income. This shows a tremendous gap between the rich and poor.
Figure 11.3 shows the growth of gross domestic product per capita compared to 
the growth of household income. In the last twenty-­five years, household income 
has been stagnant, whereas GDP has grown significantly.
For companies, this is connected to the salary gap, the difference in the pay 
between top executives and low-­level employees, which has been widening rapidly. 
Some organizations have set ratios that they try to maintain between the higher 
paid and the lower paid. To keep demand for goods and services growing, household 
incomes must increase. Individual organizations must do their part by taking action 
to correct inequality.
How Organizations Become Global
Most global organizations started out as home-­based organizations in one country 
that then grew to another country and another until they become global power-
houses. McDonalds started with one restaurant in California, and Coca-­Cola started 
with a few customers in Atlanta. Now both of these companies dominate the global 
landscape. Yet, they started slowly and grew incrementally over a period of time into 
the global powerhouses that they have become.

Table 11.4 shows the typical phases of a firm’s evolution in globalization. This 
chart shows how globalization affects several dimensions of business, such as 
expanding sales and locating manufacturing or support facilities in other countries. 
It also shows how procurement flows are gradually shifted, research and develop-
ment moves to other countries, and management becomes permeated with indi-
viduals from all over the world. The company’s national identity is sometimes even 
lost purposely. While stakeholders are initially based in the home country, global 
organizations have a global shareholder base.
Almost any firm in the international context is positioned at some point on this 
process with the goal of being a truly global organization. We are not suggesting 
that it is best to be a truly global organization, but some firms want to become so 
much a part of local communities that even the local communities identify with 
them. A good example is trying to understand where a company is based. In some 
companies, this is not a secret, and it is actually part of the market strategy. For 
example, Volkswagen will always remind its audience that German engineering is a 
part of their company. An Italian fashion designer will always remind you that it is 
an Italian company. A French wine estate will remind you that it’s French. However, 
to truly get the local acceptance of a product or service, some companies prefer 
not to be identified with a particular country. For example, it is difficult to figure 
out exactly where many pharmaceutical companies are based. The same is true for 
the “Big Four” global consulting and accounting firms: PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, and KPMG. In our own work with those organi-
zations, we have found that even many of their own consultants are not sure where 
their company is based. Different employees give different responses. Can you guess 
where they are based? PwC and EY each have dual headquarters in London and

New York. Deloitte is based in New York, and KPMG is based in Amsterdam. But 
because consultants operate in their particular countries, they each feel part of 
that country and may not realize their company is based elsewhere. It is important 
for some companies to have an image that is not attached to a particular country 
or culture but becomes a part of each local context to the greatest extent possible.
HR in a Global Company
It is one thing to sell products and services to a global market base when the need is 
there and the consumers want the product, but it is another thing entirely to employ 
a foreign workforce to make that happen in each country. From the very first time 
that a company has employees in another country, it faces many issues. There are 
ten very important challenges that are faced by most multinational companies:
	 1.	 Compliance with labor laws. Every company finds a challenge in working with 
laws, regulations, and rules in another country. These vary dramatically from 
one country to another, and companies often need the help of good advisors to 
unravel and comply with the different rules and policies.
	 2.	 Talent acquisition. It is critical to acquire the right people at the right time, 
but finding the right talent for a “foreign company” is sometimes a difficult 
task. Even simply identifying and recruiting individuals can be a challenge in 
another country.
	 3.	 Developing agile leaders. An organization needs flexible leaders who can adapt 
to the changes and challenges of operating in a global environment. They must 
be able to bring the local context and culture into their decisions and relation-
ships within each country.
	 4.	 Balancing local and home issues. Deciding which decisions must be made 
locally and which must be made at the headquarters is critical. For example, 
financial accounting may be kept at headquarters, while succession planning 
may need to be more at the local level.
	 5.	 Building capability. Employees must understand the products and services 
and how to produce or sell them. They must understand how to communicate 
and integrate with others across borders in the cultural context. Learning and 
development can be different from one country to another. For sustainability, 
capability must be enhanced routinely in the organization.
	 6.	 Efficient coordination and collaboration. A global company must be connected 
and orchestrated in its work. Employees must be synchronized in their proj-
ects and efforts, and they must collaborate on a routine basis. This gets more 
difficult when different languages and long distances are involved.
	 7.	 Retaining critical talent. Some individuals in the organization are considered 
critical talent, and these are the people who make the most difference. It is 
not always an executive or a manager. It might be the IT team, the direct sales 
force, the store managers, or the research and development professionals. The 
challenge is to retain this critical talent in the organization. High turnover can 
be disastrous.
	 8.	 Sharing knowledge across borders. Knowledge management and knowledge 
sharing are important, particularly in a knowledge-­based company. Using all 

204	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
the tools for collaboration and sharing is essential. Building databases that 
easily integrate with each other is also important.
	 9.	 Operating efficiently. The products and services delivered must be produced at 
a low cost to the organization; otherwise, competition will have an advantage. 
Efficiency is king, and delays and bottlenecks have to be removed to make a 
smooth work machine.
	10.	 Improving productivity. In addition to lowering production costs, there must be 
more output. The gross productivity of a firm, revenue divided by employees, 
must be continuously improved as technology is used, capability is enhanced, 
and engagement and motivation kick in to deliver a very powerful workforce.
These challenges are consistent with those found in many studies. For example, 
IBM’s most recent “Global Chief Human Resources Officer Study” identified devel-
oping agile leaders, retaining critical talent, improving productivity, and sharing 
knowledge as very important challenges for today’s environment.6
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
The human capital strategy should direct some very important, and sometimes 
sensitive, issues:
•	 Determine the policy and philosophy for outsourcing. It is obvious that too 
many outsourcing decisions have been made based on short-­term cost savings 
alone. Sometimes a longer-­term view is needed, and often a consideration of 
the human capital aspect needs to be a part of this decision.
•	 Focus on employment and job creation. To be a good citizen, the firm should 
aim to keep jobs as much as possible, redirecting people to other work as 
efficiencies are gained. But firms also need to look at job-­creation efforts, so 
that higher-­paying jobs are created to add value to the country as well as the 
company.
•	 Pursue innovation. As described in Chapter 7, innovation is the best way to 
make sure that new jobs can be created and that new products and services 
can be developed. Innovation also helps deliver a lower price with top quality 
so that a competitive edge can be gained.
•	 Address inequality at the firm level. This issue can be addressed in two ways. 
First, make sure that the firm moves beyond the minimum wage, if employees 
are at that level. If organizations boost their low-­level employees, the increased 
household income of that group will drive demand for goods and services. At 
the same time, it is important to be mindful of the differences between exec-
utive pay and regular employee wages, perhaps setting a particular ratio that 
makes sense to the organization and the shareholders.
•	 A communication strategy should be developed for globalization issues. When 
the organization is drastically impacted by events outside the home country, 
employees must understand why. For example, if the employees’ 401(k) plans 
have been reduced because of the debt default of Greece or falling oil prices, 
the organization needs to be proactive in explaining this. This requires very 
important communication efforts.

his chapter shows the importance of protecting the environment with a variety 
of green sustainable projects. The sheer number of potential green projects and 
initiatives, and the fact that not everyone is buying into the issues, brings into focus 
the need for this chapter. Many individuals do not see the need for action because 
they do not understand the issues or know what they can do to help. Some people 
do not understand green projects and sustainability efforts, feel inconvenienced 
Force 10: Environmentalism. This important force involves 
protecting the environment. When the issue of global warming 
first surfaced in the 1980s, it stirred up much public debate 
and concern throughout the world. However, business leaders 
resisted the issue of global warming, expecting they would have 
to pay a lot of money to address the problems causing it. While 
most agreed that climate change was occurring, views differed 
regarding its origins, and finding solutions was not a priority to 
the business world at large.
Today, most (if not all) businesses recognize that climate 
change is a problem, and some businesses are making attempts 
to solve it, resulting in a wave of sustainability and environ-
mental projects. However, too many organizations are cur-
rently caught in what may be called a green slump, struggling 
to engage in green projects and making far less progress than 
is actually required.
From an organizational perspective, going green offers 
employees, contractors, volunteers, and members the opportu-
nity to influence the green movement through involvement and 
contribution. The challenge is to create the correct approach 
to involve these people—­one that includes teaching, convinc-
ing, communicating, enabling, supporting, and encouraging par-
ticipation in the green process. The best way to accomplish this 
is through the human capital strategy.

by them, believe they are negatively affected in one way or another by project out-
comes, or perceive projects to require unrealistic investment.
This chapter presents the many facets of the green revolution and how organi-
zations are managing to go green. It explores the value of green projects and what 
must be accomplished by the CHRO to deliver results to protect the environment.
Opening Story: Interface
Interface Inc. began in 1973 when founder and chairman Ray C. Anderson rec-
ognized the need for flexible floorcoverings that would facilitate the emerging 
technologies of the modern office. Over the years, Interface grew its core business 
and expanded through more than fifty acquisitions to become the world’s largest 
producer of modular carpet, with manufacturing on four continents and sales in 
more than 110 countries. Today, Interface is a billion-­dollar corporation, named by 
Fortune magazine as one of the “Most Admired Companies in America” and “100 
Best Companies to Work For.”
In 1994, while preparing remarks on Interface’s environmental vision for a com-
pany task-­force meeting, Ray Anderson experienced a fundamental perspective 
change. Seeking inspiration for his speech, Ray read Paul Hawken’s “The Ecology 
of Commerce” and was deeply moved—­an experience he described as an epiph-
any. It awakened Ray to the urgent need to set a new course for Interface toward 
sustainability.
In that year, Anderson set a daring goal for his commercial carpet company: 
to take nothing from the earth that cannot be replaced by the earth. At the time, 
carpet manufacturing was a toxic petroleum-­based process that released immense 
amounts of air and water pollution and created tons of waste. In the fifteen years 
since Anderson’s call for change, Interface has accomplished the following:
•	 Cut greenhouse gas emissions by 82 percent
•	 Cut fossil fuel consumption by 60 percent
•	 Cut waste by 66 percent
•	 Cut water use by 75 percent
•	 Invented and patented new machines, materials, and manufacturing processes
•	 Increased sales by 66 percent, doubled earnings, and raised profit margins
The journey to a fully sustainable Interface is like climbing “a mountain higher than 
Everest”—­difficult, yes, but with a careful and attentive plan, not impossible. Interface 
created a framework for the climb called “Seven Fronts on Mount Sustainability”:
Front #1—­Eliminate Waste: Eliminate all forms of waste in every area of the business.
Front #2—­Benign Emissions: Eliminate toxic substances from products, vehicles, 
and facilities.
Front #3—­Renewable Energy: Operate facilities with 100 percent renewable energy.
Front #4—­Closing the Loop: Redesign processes and products to close the technical 
loop using recycled and bio-­based materials.
Front #5—­Efficient Transportation: Transport people and products efficiently to 
eliminate waste and emissions.

Front #6—­Sensitizing Stakeholders: Create a culture that uses sustainability prin-
ciples to improve the lives and livelihoods of all our stakeholders.
Front #7—­Redesign Commerce: Create a new business model that demonstrates 
and supports the value of sustainability-­based commerce.
As part of its Mission Zero commitment, Interface has set a goal to source 100 per-
cent of energy needs from renewable sources by 2020. To achieve this, Interface has 
a simple strategy—­improve energy efficiency and increase use of renewable energy. 
They have taken an aggressive approach to reach this goal, installing renewable 
energy systems at factories and purchasing renewable energy for facilities around 
the world. By 2013, five of its seven factories operated with 100 percent renewable 
electricity, and 35 percent of its total energy use was from renewable sources.
The vision and mission of Interface focuses on sustainability.

the power of our influence in the world.
Ray Anderson and Interface have been featured in three documentary films, 
including The Corporation and So Right, So Smart. In 1997, Anderson was named 
cochair of the President’s Council on Sustainable Development, and in 2006, he 
served on the national advisory committee that helped guide the Presidential Cli-
mate Action Project, a two-­year, $2 million project administered by the Wirth Chair 
School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado. He and Interface have been 
featured in the New York Times, Fortune, Fast Company, and other publications.

Anderson died on August 8, 2011, twenty months after being diagnosed with 
cancer. On July 28, 2012, Anderson’s family relaunched the Ray C. Anderson Foun-
dation with a new purpose. Originally created to fund Ray Anderson’s personal 
philanthropic giving, family members announced the rebirth and refocus of the foun-
dation on Anderson’s birthday, nearly one year after his 2011 death. The purpose of 
the Ray C. Anderson Foundation is to perpetuate shared values and continue the 
legacy that Anderson left behind. The Ray C. Anderson Foundation is a not-­for-­
profit 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to create a brighter, sustainable world 
through the funding of innovative projects that promote and advance the concepts 
of sustainable production and consumption. The world needs more leaders like Ray 
C. Anderson and organizations like Interface.
The Green Revolution
A green revolution is occurring throughout the world, and this effort toward funda-
mental change is particularly pervasive in the United States. Perhaps Thomas Fried-
man captures this revolution best in his bestselling book Hot, Flat, and Crowded, 
in which he makes the case for a green revolution that should sweep through orga-
nizations, cities, communities, and governments to create what he describes as the 
Energy Climate Era.1 Here are a few examples of green initiatives.
Green Cities
Discussions about environmental issues often dwell on cities, focusing on their con-
gestion, inefficiencies, and unmanageable challenges. Tall buildings, consuming 
enormous amounts of energy, and heavy traffic, inundating the environment with 
carbon emissions, are obvious environmental hazards. The cities themselves have 
taken the brunt of many of the social ills that stem from poverty, illness, crime, pol-
lution, open sewers, and exhaust fumes. Despite these burdens, however, cities—­
with their great density—­offer perhaps the best opportunities for environmentally 
friendly places to live and work. For example, the population density in Manhattan 
is sixty-­seven thousand people per square mile, more than eight hundred times the 
nation as a whole and roughly thirty times the city of Los Angeles. In dense cities, 
residents can often live without the convenience of an automobile. Working near 
home allows people to live without the ecological disasters of cars, in contrast to 
workers who live in rural or suburban areas and have to use an automobile for every 
trip. In cities, people can engage in environmentally friendly habits such as bicy-
cling, using mass transit, and walking while supporting each other as a community. 
Some cities are working hard to increase their residential appeal, which reduces the 
environmental burden caused by the mass exodus of the workforce commuting 
home at the end of the day. Some cities, airports, and ports are striving to be the 
greenest in the world, with much progress.
Green Organizations
The starting point for most organizations is to organize properly for green initia-
tives. This process begins with a mission statement, a vision statement, and a value 
statement that all incorporate green issues and sustainability efforts. This also 
involves the assignment of specific responsibilities to individuals involved in green

projects. Role definition for all organizational stakeholders is a must if involvement, 
support, encouragement, and accomplishment of green objectives is the goal. An 
executive should be assigned the responsibility of environmental and sustainability 
efforts. Ideally this should be the CHRO. Figure 12.1 highlights the seven actions that 
must be taken to create a green organization.
Employees must understand the necessity for green projects and be aware of 
important environmental issues. Formal and informal meetings and communica-
tions using the plethora of social media tools can help. Learning programs make 
employees aware of the issues and the necessity to make improvements and adjust-
ments. Brochures, guides, fact sheets, program descriptions, and progress reports 
help promote and encourage green project participation.
Organizational leaders must “practice what they preach” through visible and 
substantial green projects. These projects should be communicated to the organi-
zation, and their successes should be clearly documented. An example of a highly 
visible project is one that has been undertaken by Hewlett-­Packard. A problem exists 
with the mountains of consumer electronics being disposed of in landfills. To set an 
example in this important area, HP has collected more than three billion pounds of 
e-­waste (the weight of three thousand jumbo jets) since 1987. More than 75 percent 
of ink cartridges and 24 percent of HP LaserJet toner cartridges are now manufac-
tured with “closed loop” recycled plastic. HP remanufacturing programs give IT 
hardware, such as servers, storage, and networking products, a new lease on life, 
reducing environmental impacts from disposal.2

Organizations are enabling stakeholders to be involved in green projects in 
their communities and in their personal lives. Organizations assist employees with 
recycling programs and support employees in a variety of ways to understand, pro-
mote, and be involved in green initiatives. For example, eight communities across 
the United States joined to create Climate Prosperity Project Inc., a nonprofit 
organization to address climate change and pursue economic development. The 
communities—­Silicon Valley / San Jose, CA; Portland, OR; St. Louise, MO/IL; Den-
ver, CO; Seattle, WA; Southwest, FL; Montgomery County, MD; and the State of 
Delaware—­are convinced that climate change presents not only an environmental 
imperative but also an extraordinary economic opportunity.
Progressive companies are rewarding stakeholders for being involved in green 
efforts. For example, Southern Company has launched EarthCents programs, which 
include new and existing programs and educational efforts to help reduce residen-
tial and commercial energy consumption. The benefits of EarthCents include not 
only wise use of energy but also reduction of costs that hit the pockets of their cus-
tomers. In addition, shareholders are rewarded because corporate costs are reduced 
and capital expenditures are avoided.3 Through EarthCents education programs, 
employees have an opportunity to engage in stewardship that is highly valued and 
recognized by the organization. Some organizations provide quarterly or annual 
awards for green efforts by employees or groups of employees. Others provide 
bonuses for green ideas.
It is important for green-­project success to be monitored and adjustments to 
be made along the way. Results must be communicated to stakeholders even if 
they show processes are not working well. The lobby of the International Fund for 
Agriculture Development (IFAD) boasts a large chart showing the progress of green 
projects. Measurement is a critical part of accountability, and making adjustments 
as measures are taken is a great way to keep projects on track.
Green organizations purchase green materials and supplies through their 
procurement functions by specifying and requiring green products. This is 
important with cleaning materials, for example, which can be toxic and hazard-
ous to the environment. Purchasing green paper products is a highly visible way 
to contribute to the green movement, because it touches so many employees and 
stakeholders.
Progressive green organizations ensure that their products and services are sen-
sitive to environmental issues and support sustainability efforts. This may mean 
that new products are developed to support the green movement. For example, 
Office Depot/OfficeMax researched how to transform its market based on creat-
ing a green office. These offerings include a green book catalog as well as a green 
office website. This site provides customers with definitions of terms and certifi-
cations, such as postconsumer recycled content. Through its effort, Office Depot/ 
OfficeMax reinforces to businesses that there are real cost-­saving opportunities 
with green products.
Collectively, these efforts are being taken up by thousands of organizations. 
If implemented properly, they can make significant progress with sustainability 
efforts. The important point is to make sure the value and success of these projects 
are known to stakeholders responsible for the design, implementation, and funding 
of projects.4

Green Buildings
Green organizations should be housed in green buildings, which represent another 
important opportunity and challenge. The opportunity exists because there are more 
than thirty million buildings in the United States, most of which are anything but 
green. These buildings consume about one-­quarter of the global wood harvest, one-­
sixth of its fresh water, and two-­fifths of the material and energy flows. They account 
for about 40 percent of primary energy use.5 A typical house in the United States 
produces twenty-­six thousand pounds of greenhouse gases each year, enough to fill 
up a Goodyear blimp. The challenge is that becoming a green building is not easy.
The good news is that major building projects across the country are now largely 
adhering to new benchmarks with environmentally sustainable construction stan-
dards, focusing not only on recycled building materials but energy efficiency as 
well. At the center of this movement is a certification program offered by the U.S. 
Green Building Council (USGBC). This program, known as Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, is a third-­party verification system 
to show that a building was designed and built using true environmental standards, 
including energy savings, water efficiency, and CO2 emissions reduction. Almost all 
the large-­scale commercial projects in the United States are now LEED projects, and 
given that more than half of greenhouse gases come from buildings (compared to 9 
percent for passenger vehicles), this is huge step in the right direction.
Green Workplaces
When people are not at home, they are usually at work, so the workplace represents 
another important area of focus for green initiatives. The workplace provides an 
opportunity for people to function in a green environment, learn about green issues, 
experiment with green projects, and observe cost savings at the same time. Figure 12.2 
shows opportunities to make a workplace green.
Figure 12.2.  Making a green workplace.

Perhaps the greatest opportunity to save money and have a positive impact on 
the environment is to take advantage of the many possible options to let people work 
at home. Some organizations allow two or more employees to use a single assigned 
workplace and rotate schedules. Sometimes several people share office space close to 
their home at a reduced cost. Of course, the greatest environmental benefit comes 
from working at home full-­time. One study revealed that 1,478 tons of carbon 
dioxide was prevented from being released into the environment each year when  
350 employees were allowed to work at home.6 Many organizations have been using 
telecommuting practices for years. Not only does the practice contribute to the 
environmental good, but many find that allowing employees to work at home cre-
ates a significant savings in real estate costs, as they are able to give up office space 
when the leases expire. Companies also find that productivity increases, because 
employees working at home are able to maintain larger workloads. Other benefits 
include gains in retention, job satisfaction, and talent recruitment, as described in 
Chapter 6.
Another important savings at the workplace can come from the reduced use of 
water, electricity, and natural gas. Although technology, design, and control mecha-
nisms can make a difference, behavior change by the workforce can have the greatest 
impact. Many cost-­saving processes can lower utility bills and help the environ-
ment. Simply shutting down computers at the end of the day and using motion-­
detection lighting can have a big impact on energy usage and operating costs.
Since the 1980s, businesses have been exploring ways to maintain a green work-
place, from paper and toner cartridges to almost every office product category. 
Unfortunately, the traditional perception of making an office green is that costs 
will increase. This is not necessarily true. Even when items cost more initially, there 
is often a payback in the long run. Improvements have been made in the production 
of green office products. Businesses need to recognize that there is a green cost 
continuum. Some products, such as remanufactured ink or toner cartridges, are 
greener and less expensive. Also, investments in durable items rather than dispos-
able ones, as well as in reusable and energy efficient items for the office, can mean 
dollars added to the company’s bottom line due to decreased operating costs and 
repurchase costs.
Maintaining a green work environment creates an important image for con-
sumers, employees, and others who care about the green movement. Consumers 
are attracted to companies that are environmentally responsible, and employees 
often want to work for companies that put the environment first. This can be an 
attractive recruiting tool, particularly for younger employees who want to work in 
this type of environment.
Indoor air quality is also a critical issue for employee health and well-­being. 
Mold in the workplace—­along with exposure to laser toner, cleaning agents, car-
bon monoxide, aerosols, and other items—­can lead to a variety of ailments for 
employees, such as asthma and nasal irritations. The proper use of cleaning prod-
ucts and regular heating, ventilation, and air conditioning maintenance will make 
a difference.
The workplace is a fertile ground for green initiatives. It represents a major 
opportunity to shape employees’ behavior. To do so will require a systematic 
approach to show the value, importance, and success of a variety of green initiatives.

Green Meetings
One of the top offenders to the environment is the meetings and events industry, 
rated only second to the construction industry. Each year, tens of thousands of meet-
ings are organized globally where people convene to discuss all types of issues. Long-­
distance travel, large meeting places, and constant hotel stays have a huge impact 
on the environment. For example, the annual conference of the Society for Human 
Resource Management (SHRM)—­the world’s largest association of human resources 
professionals with about 275,000 members—­attracts HR specialists, managers, and 
executives from around the world. A recent meeting in Las Vegas drew approximately 
12,000 participants, about one-­fourth of them from outside the United States. Every-
one travels to the meeting; most of the travel is by air, and many flights involve long 
distances. The conference accommodates nearly 2,000 exhibitors, and some exhibits 
are so large that they need to be trucked in prior to the conference. Attendees take 
up thousands of hotel rooms, consume a tremendous amount of local transporta-
tion, and then travel back to their original destination. The effect this one meeting 
has on the environment is significant. Multiply this by all types of private company 
meetings, professional associations, trade shows, and special events, and it becomes 
clear why this industry is destroying the environment.
A few experts in the green and environmental movements suggest that, for the 
most part, these large-­scale meetings should go away. In this era, such conferences 
add little to knowledge and understanding, they damage the environment, and 
much of what they do can be accomplished in other ways. While this is a harsh 
position, the industry is facing challenges on several fronts. Technology has enabled 
people to meet more conveniently and without the cost of the travel. Many execu-
tives are questioning the value of this expenditure. The recent global recession has 
put many of these events in the crosshairs of cost-­cutting CEOs.
Green Energy
Many observers see green energy as the key to solving the climate-­change problem. 
They posit that clean energy is the solution to all environmental ills. The topic of 
clean energy garners much attention, focus, and money, although some projections 
are bleak as energy demand increases. There are many projects and programs in 
place to tackle the issue.
Suppliers of energy realize that the best way to address the crisis is simply to 
save energy. This is why electrical power companies and other energy providers are 
advising consumers on ways to save electricity. Indeed, this may be the only way for 
them to meet the demand. This involves saving energy through efficient light bulbs, 
pumps, and motors; good building design; and refined processes.
A variety of new green power sources are being developed from solar, wind, 
small hydro, biomass, and geothermal sources. These are being funded in part by 
business energy users as they purchase renewable energy certificates (REC). With 
the RECs, businesses are buying power that is purchased from the new power 
sources and placed on the grid. It is impossible to hook a business up directly to a 
wind farm, but the business can purchase the equivalent of the power they need to 
be generated by the wind farm. It is like trading in the commodity market. This is 
providing significant funding for new sources of green power.

Green Technology
A bright spot in the green revolution is that the development of new technolo-
gies are, in some cases, central to green projects and sustainability efforts. Some 
advocates describe green technology as a huge growth opportunity for the next 
decade. Just as information technology exploded in the 1990s, green technology is 
set to be the next major growth sector. Renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, 
green-­building design, environmentally friendly construction and retrofits, greater 
efficiencies in lighting and appliances, smart grids, clean-­energy transportation—­
all are markets of promise to generate jobs and profits globally.
Green technology does not have to represent huge projects; small devices can 
make a difference. Consider, for example, power adaptors—­the boxes on charging 
cords that that either sit between the plug and the mobile phone or are integrated 
with the plug. There are about five billion power adaptor devices in use worldwide. 
The function of the power adapter is to convert high-­voltage alternating current 
into the low-­voltage direct current that is used for charging mobile phones, tablets, 
and other electronic devices. Until recently, the conversion was made using copper 
wire, and as much as 80 percent of the power was lost in the conversion as waste 
heat. Now conversion can be made more efficiently with an integrated circuit, with 
as little as 20 percent of the power being lost. It took some time for manufacturers, 
utilities, and state and federal authorities to work together to adopt the new tech-
nology, but for consumers, the switches mean lower power bills and smaller and 
lighter power adapters. Although they cost a little more to produce, the savings are 
tremendous. For the world as whole, this has meant a drop in global power con-
sumption that is worth about $2 billion per year and saves thirteen million tons of 
carbon emissions annually.
Technology projects are fast growing and almost limitless. Green technology 
patents are on a growth path, and the U.S. government is expediting the patent 
process, reducing the traditional time it takes for a patent to be processed from forty 
months to one year. Faster patent reviews mean that firms can arrange financing 
more easily. This action should generate additional research and development from 
private firms (large and small) and universities as well. New products will likely 
emerge, including patents for hardware, software, and communication devices 
to monitor commercial and home energy use. All types of technologies are being 
developed to cut carbon emissions.
Managing the Change to Green
The landscape is covered with all types of green initiatives and projects, and the 
CHRO should have the responsibility for these projects. Sustainability must be inte-
grated, managed, and properly implemented to reap the greatest rewards. There 
are several factors that help drive the changes that are taking place in the green 
revolution.
The number one driver for implementing green projects is the image it presents 
of an organization. Green is in vogue in all types of organizations. Organizations 
recognize that it is in their best interests for their constituents, consumers, employ-
ees, stakeholders, and the general public to view them as environmentally friendly.

In 2009, when Mike Duke took over as CEO of Wal-­Mart, the world’s largest 
retailer, which uses more electricity than any other private organization in the world 
and has the second-­largest trucking company, his message to employees in a time of 
recession covered the expected topics about providing good service, keeping costs 
low, and beating the competition.7 However, he also talked about sustainability. 
Specifically, he described many of the environmental projects that Wal-­Mart had 
undertaken to reduce transportation and energy costs. He emphasized that these 
sustainability efforts must be accelerated and broadened in the future, regardless 
of the recession.
Why would the world’s largest retailer, with approximately $500 billion in net 
sales and eleven thousand stores in twenty-­seven countries, focus so much on the 
green issue?8 Wal-­Mart sees this as a way to provide low prices as they manage and 
control costs, which enables them to stay profitable, drive innovation, and help 
many of their customers through difficult times.
Sustainability, which includes sustaining the life of an organization, the profits 
of the organization, and society at large, is a part of Wal-­Mart’s strategy. A green 
strategy often focuses on protecting and restoring the ecosystem, and it involves 
actions and conditions that affect the earth’s ecology, including reduction of climate 
change, preservation of natural resources, and prevention of toxic waste hazards.
During the last two decades, organizations have begun to incorporate strate-
gies for sustainability with tremendous focus on green elements. Like all strategies, 
these plans must evolve from a clear understanding of where the organization is 
and where it can go, and they require the input and buy-­in of all stakeholders. Plans 
should show how the strategies can be implemented and achieved with effort, deter-
mination, and deliberation. Organizations must review these strategies occasion-
ally to see how they are working and apply great leadership throughout the process 
to make sure that each strategy is challenging, feasible, workable, and successful.
There is often a perception that a clean environment is going to cost everyone—­
that green initiatives come with a premium. This is not always the case. In fact, there 
are more opportunities for positive ROI values with green projects than negative 
ROI values.9 Smart, progressive companies use their environmental strategies to 
innovate, create value, and build competitive advantage, and the opportunities are 
endless. To convince a group of money-­conscious executives to undertake green 
projects, a method must exist that shows there is value in these projects that will 
ensure continued funding and growth.
According to Andrew Winston, green projects may represent the best way to 
stimulate the economy and keep companies prosperous. He suggests four strategies 
to turn green into gold:
•	 Get lean. Generate immediate bottom-­line savings by reducing energy use and 
waste.
•	 Get smart. Use value-­chain data to cut costs, reduce risks, and focus innovation 
efforts.
•	 Get creative. Pose theoretical questions that force you to find solutions to 
tomorrow’s challenges today.
•	 Get engaged. Give employees ownership of environmental goals and the tools 
to act on them.10

As we continue to work to manage the change to green, one of the main chal-
lenges is to convince a variety of stakeholders about the value that green projects 
deliver, up to and including the financial ROI.
Another important element of managing change involves taking advantage of 
the “green-­collar” economy. This concept essentially addresses two of the biggest 
problems facing most countries: the economy and the environment. A green job is 
defined as one with “decent wages and benefits that can support a family. It has to 
be part of a real career path, with upward mobility. And it needs to reduce waste 
and pollution and benefit the environment.”11
Development of new green products and services, such as new sources of 
energy and new technologies, leads to new jobs. These jobs are significant in 
number, and the investments are large enough to drive the economy. In addition 
to the bottom-­line contribution, both to those who obtain the new jobs and the 
economy at large, green jobs ultimately have a positive environmental impact. In 
the United States, the best example of perpetuating a green-­collar economy is the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included more than $60 billion 
in clean-­energy investment intended to help jumpstart the economy and build 
clean energy jobs for tomorrow. This investment is expected to easily generate 
a more than $500 billion return in new jobs, business startups, expansion, and 
energy savings.12
The fifty interviews conducted by MIT in its Business of Sustainability Initiative 
revealed significant behavior changes that have taken place and must continue to 
take place. As organizations work to address environmental sustainability projects, 
there are eight management behaviors for leaders to keep in mind:
	 1.	 Sustainability projects will find you; it is hard to escape it. It is best to plan for 
it now.
	 2.	 Do not be surprised if you see unexpected productivity gains from green 
projects.
	 3.	 Your reputation is at stake; not addressing the green issues could seriously 
tarnish your efforts.
	 4.	 Strategy is needed and must be executed to see the system as a whole and to 
connect the dots.
	 5.	 Sustainability challenges demand innovation that is more iterative, more 
patient, and more diverse.
	 6.	 There must be collaboration across all boundaries to be successful.
	 7.	 The fear of risks has skyrocketed, creating a need for any practice or behavior 
that would access risk and reduce it.
	 8.	 The first adaptors with particular processes will be the winners.13
With this push and need for sustainability, there must be a focus on changing 
the behavior of people involved in this process. Attitudes, perceptions, awareness, 
and the barriers to actions must be addressed. As illustrated in the next chapter, 
there are many obstacles that can kill a project before it has a chance to add value. 
The measurement process described in this book can be used to assess a project’s 
success and allow leaders to make adjustments to drive results.

The Value of Green Projects
“Is it worth it?” When asked this question about new or proposed green projects 
and sustainability initiatives, many executives, government officials, community 
leaders, and others involved with the environmental movement will answer with a 
resounding “Yes!” Others, however, respond with hesitancy. Some need convincing 
that there is value in going green.
The ultimate payoff of green projects and sustainability efforts is addressing 
climate change, deforestation, famine, and many other issues we face. Unfortu-
nately, progress is lacking. Even at the microlevel, as hundreds of green projects are 
initiated every day, progress is minimal.
The Green Killers
When we consider the problems facing the planet and its future state, the need for 
healing is evident. Unfortunately, there are some people who do not support sus-
tainability efforts. While many individuals stand in the way of progress, much of 
their inertia is based on misunderstandings of the need to make improvements. The 
sad truth is that people struggle to change. Elected officials and business leaders are 
not highly respected these days, and so when they tell us, “Trust me, this is good for 
all of us, just go and do it,” people tend to tune them out.
Defining Value
Figure 12.3 shows some of the questions and issues that often arise when people are 
first introduced to green projects and sustainability efforts. They represent less-­
than-­supportive attitudes toward green initiatives. These “green killers” inhibit 
progress and success.
The killers are categorized along a five-­level results framework that is funda-
mental to the ROI Methodology, which is described in more detail in Chapter 14. 
The levels of data follow a chain of impact that must be in place for a green project 
to add business value.
The first level of value is reaction and perceived value. As the “Reaction/Per-
ceived Value” section of Figure 12.3 shows, many people are still apathetic or believe 
their actions can make no real difference. They seem to think that sustainability is 
someone else’s problem or that the only way to change it is through regulations and 
laws tackling the energy companies and the big polluters. Because of these initial 
reactions to green projects, CHROs must position the projects so employees, cus-
tomers, and suppliers can perceive them as relevant and valuable.
The second level of value is learning. Try this experiment. Take five of the 
important elements that describe climate change, such as change in average 
weather over time, increase in CO2 in atmosphere, local species extinction due to 
global loss of biodiversity, variations in solar radiation, or abrupt climate change, 
and ask your friends if they understand their meaning. Chances are, out of ten 
people, only one will be able to describe all five. There has not been enough spe-
cific information offered about climate change, particularly for the population 
born prior to 1970. Sustainability issues are now a part of most academic course 
curricula, but for the majority of the world’s population, there has been limited 
education.

Consider the simple issue of changing to an alternative type of light bulb. In 
the United States, lighting represents about 20 percent of all electricity usage. A 
standard incandescent light bulb costs around $2 and uses about $20 of electricity 
per year. In contrast, a low-­energy bulb costs about $8–­$10 but only uses about $4 of 
electricity per year. With a cost reduction of $16 per year and an investment of $10, 
the benefits clearly exceed the costs.
While it makes sense financially, as well as environmentally, for people to change 
their bulbs, changing to energy-­efficient lighting is a behavior many consumers 
cannot conceive. Manufacturers of energy efficient bulbs blame this on public apa-
thy or lack of awareness. In this case, the public needs to be aware not only of how 
a particular green project can work but also of its benefits to the climate as well as 
the pocketbook. The learning that must take place is substantial. The more peo-
ple know, the less resistant they will become. Even with government interventions 
phasing out the less efficient incandescent bulbs and offering only energy efficient 
bulbs, educating the public is essential.
The third level of value is application and implementation. Perhaps the greatest 
problem with green projects is people’s inability to change current habits. Essen-
tially, there is often limited application or implementation of processes focusing on 
 Reaction/Perceived Value 
I cannot make a difference. 
This is not a critical issue.

It is up to the government. 
It is not important to me.

This will be a negative ROI.  
This is not worth it.

green outcomes, at least at the level that may be needed to achieve desired results. 
Sometimes people do not do what is needed because it is inconvenient, it requires 
a change of habit, or they think they cannot do it. Others think that it may take too 
much time and see many barriers to the actual success of the project. Still others 
see that they can do it but need support. Consider this story:
After much political wrangling, you manage to install energy-­efficient lighting 
in a high-­end hotel restaurant. The project will save thousands of dollars in 
electricity costs while preventing tons of carbon emissions from entering the 
atmosphere. It is the “rubber meets the road” of the sustainability movement, 
the blue-­collar work of the climate battle. The restaurant opens, and the man-
ager is put off by the sight of compact fluorescent bulbs. He removes the bulbs, 
throws them out, and replaces them with inefficient halogens. Not because he 
is ignorant or because he does not care, but because he has a business to run, 
and he is doing it the best way he knows how. His perspective is: you do not 
put energy-­efficient fluorescent bulbs in a fancy restaurant any more than you 
would put Cool Whip on an éclair.
Nonetheless, this is what your sustainability efforts have brought you: a 
wasted design and installation fee; inefficient lighting; the manager’s loss of 
faith in green technology; hundreds of expensive compact fluorescent bulbs 
that, instead of being reused (at the very least), are now leeching costs for 
new bulbs and installation.14
There must be bottom-­line consequences for many people to change their 
behaviors, particularly toward an outcome they believe is still somewhat elusive.
The fourth level of value is impact. Most individuals sponsoring green projects 
want to know the impact a project is going to have and the specific measures it will 
drive. Those involved want to know how it will affect them personally. Employees 
want to know how it will affect their work or maybe even their employer. Others want 
to know the impact on a community group or the city where they live. Some want to 
know what affect it has on the environment or how it helps the sustainability effort. 
Unfortunately, this evidence is often needed before the decision to begin is made. 
If the project involves savings in electricity usage, for example, some want to know 
before investing how much savings will occur. While there may be enough credible 
data to make a reliable forecast, the convincing needs to be strong. Some of the 
important impacts are energy use, carbon emissions, recycle volume, fuel costs, 
supplies costs, and landfill costs.
From our work at the ROI Institute, we recognize that impact data are the most 
critical data executives want to see. Executives are often willing to invest in green 
projects if there are intangible benefits that do not figure into the ROI calculation. 
So it is the impact data that are critical, and this must be developed for many exec-
utives to invest.
The fifth level of value is return on investment (ROI). Some people believe that 
green projects will result in a negative payoff. There is often an impression that a 
premium price is paid for anything that is green in nature. Perhaps this is based on 
a memory of when, years ago, recycled paper was expensive. In reality, most green 
products can actually save money in the long term, but the perception still exists 

220	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
that the cost of green outweighs the benefits, resulting in a negative ROI. As such, 
people conclude that green is not worth it. More examples are needed to show the 
costs versus benefits for a variety of projects.15
Change Toward Green
The green killers lead to inaction or inappropriate action affecting outcomes associ-
ated with green projects. While it is disappointing that attitudes, perceptions, lack 
of interest, and purposeful (or not) green washing seem to get in the way of making 
progress with sustainability efforts, these barriers exist with almost any type of 
change. For change to occur, employees must have a favorable reaction, understand 
the issues, and take appropriate action. The good news is that most people have 
a genuine interest in sustaining and developing our world. Research conducted 
at Wal-­Mart and reported in the book Strategy for Sustainability describes some 
interesting findings.16 The author interviewed Wal-­Mart associates, exploring the 
basic concepts of sustainability and discussing what mattered to most of them. 
Here are some of the findings:
	 1.	 They believe the environment is in crisis. Once you removed the politics from 
the equation, people were ready to believe in global warming.
	 2.	 They want to learn more about it. Wal-­Mart associates value learning, and any 
time they had the chance to learn something new that they could share, they 
were excited.
	 3.	 They want to do something about it. They lead busy lives with complex demands 
from family, work, religion, and hobbies. But if they could do something to help 
the environment that would also help them achieve their other goals, they were 
all for it.
	 4.	 They have not made sustainability their top priority. Sustainability does not 
work as another “thing” to care or worry about. But when the author presented 
sustainability as a framework that could help manage the other priorities in 
their lives, from personal health to finances, they were able to conceive of it as 
a matter of common sense.
Just as sustainability does not work for businesses unless it serves business needs 
first, sustainability does not engage individuals unless it first and foremost solves 
problems they experience in their lives.
The Chain of Impact for Green Projects
Sometimes it is helpful to think about the success of a green project in terms of a chain 
of impact that must occur if the project is going to be successful in terms of its business 
contribution. After all, if there is no business contribution, it is unlikely the project will 
be implemented. The chain of impact includes the five categories of data discussed in 
general terms previously. Together, these five levels form a chain of impact that occurs 
as projects are implemented.17 But this chain of impact begins with the inputs to the 
process. Inputs, referred to as “Level 0,” include the people involved in the project, 
how long it will take it to work, cost, resources, and efficiencies.
Obviously, these data are essential to move forward with a project, but they 
do not speak to the success of the project. It is through reaction, learning, and 

Protect the Environment
221
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
application of knowledge, skill, and information that a positive impact is made on 
business measures. Stakeholders realize how much impact is due to the project 
because a step occurs that will isolate the effects of the project from other influences. 
Impact measures are converted to money and compared to the cost to determine the 
ROI. In addition to these outcomes, intangible benefits are reported. Though they 
are not a new level of data, intangibles represent impact measures purposefully not 
converted to money and are always reported in addition to the monetary contribu-
tion of a project. Figure 12.4 represents this chain of impact that occurs through the 
implementation of green projects and key questions asked at each level.

Implications for Human Capital Strategy
Strong leadership is necessary for projects to work. Leaders must ensure that green 
projects and sustainability efforts are designed to achieve results rather than just to 
improve image. These projects and efforts must deliver the value that is needed by 
all stakeholders. Several actions must be taken to provide effective, results-­based 
green leadership:
•	 Allocate appropriate resources for green projects and sustainability efforts.
•	 Assign responsibilities for green projects and programs, perhaps under the 
CHRO.
•	 Link green projects and programs to specific business needs.
•	 Create expectations for the projects’ success with all stakeholders involved, 
detailing their roles and responsibilities.
•	 Address the barriers to the successful project early on so that the barriers can 
be removed, minimized, or circumvented.
•	 Develop partnerships with key administrators, managers, and other principle 
participants who can make the project successful.
•	 Communicate project results to the appropriate stakeholders as often as nec-
essary to focus on process improvement.

This chapter discusses the importance of developing global leaders and the 
human resources role in that challenge. Few things are more important to an 
organization than having great leadership, as leaders make the difference in the 
organization’s success, sustainability, and impact on shareholders, customers, 
employees, and the community. 
Opening Stories
Investment in leadership development is at a all time high. Here are three exam-
ples of leadership development approaches.1
Agilent Technologies
This manufacturer of instruments and equipment for life sciences, healthcare, 
and the chemical industry has introduced a leadership effectiveness analysis pro-
gram, which has led to improvements across a number of key business outcomes. 
Introduced by incoming chief executive Bill Sullivan, the program has changed the 
Force 11: Global Leadership. Highly effective leadership is 
needed throughout every organization, from the first-­level 
managers to the CEO. For international firms, a global per-
spective is critical, as leaders operate in a volatile, uncertain, 
complex, and ambiguous world. Even if an organization does 
not have a presence outside its initial borders, the global land-
scape will affect it in many ways. Understanding global dynam-
ics and translating the information into excellent decisions and 
actions will determine the survival of the organization. The 
chief human resources officer must take the lead in developing 
leadership programs, processes, and events to ensure that lead-
ers are ready and effective. This chapter takes a fresh a look at 
leadership and leadership development, detailing what has been 
achieved, what needs to be accomplished, and the next steps.

strategic intent of the company through leadership excellence and created a set of 
expectations for leaders to fulfill.
The analysis takes the form of a leadership audit, with the questions adjusted 
over time to reflect not only changes in the business but also changes in leadership 
measurements. The results of the surveys are measured against external norms 
rather than against previous survey results. Once scores for particular traits have 
reached a level that is considered top quartile and it is clear that a particular leader-
ship quality has become embedded in the company, new questions are introduced.
This leadership effectiveness analysis has enabled Agilent to develop different 
expectations of leaders at different levels, based on a “core” of expectations running 
all the way through the business. The analysis has become part of the DNA of the 
company and has a participation rate of 89 percent.
The program was implemented from the C-­suite downward in order to ensure 
that when leaders began participating in the program, their own managers were 
already fully supportive of it. The analysis provides Agilent’s twelve thousand 
employees with a reliable, consistent understanding of what leadership is and 
ensures that every business leader is following the same path. This has helped Agi-
lent, which operates across many sites and has made a number of acquisitions in the 
past six years, ensure that its leadership is aligned across the company.
In addition to surveying its employees, Agilent also surveys its customers, and 
it has found that customers and employees give similar feedback, underlining 
the value of the program. It should come as no surprise that Agilent’s customer 
loyalty and customer satisfaction ratings are better than those of its best-­in-­class 
competitors.
In addition, the program has helped to create a company-­wide understanding of 
the direction of the company, as set out by the chief executive, and employee reten-
tion is better than the market average. The program has also helped Agilent attract 
new talent, with acceptance rates now above 90 percent. Ultimately, Agilent has 
seen a marked improvement in the leadership of the company, as the analysis has 
helped identify managers who are struggling to lead their teams effectively and the 
specific areas in which they are struggling. This has enabled HR to provide targeted 
support for these leaders, pairing them with mentors, teaching best practices, and 
working closely with them to improve their leadership skills.
PepsiCo
This food and beverage company based in New York is focusing heavily on leader-
ship development programs to support its managers. While the company generally 
takes a top-­down approach to training, the company found that new managers 
have a high risk of failure without the right support. This led PepsiCo to begin its 
leadership program with individuals assuming a management role for the first time.
The First Time Manager program was implemented because new managers ben-
efit from greater support following their promotion. The program is a global one, 
and as the company works on a governance model, all the company’s sector chief 
HR officers were in favor of initiating the leadership transition suite of programs by 
first focusing on the transition from individual contributor to manager. In addition, 
a global task force was set up to assist with the design of the program. It takes the 
form of a two-­day residential course, followed by eighteen months of continuous 

Build Global Leaders

learning, with participants undertaking regular tasks, readings, and so on to provide 
a combination of both active and passive learning.
The course focuses on teaching newly promoted managers the value of the role 
of a manager and adapting to a “manager mindset,” and it provides guidance on how 
managers should adjust their time usage to ensure that they are properly delegating 
while at the same time building on the talent within their team.
PepsiCo has also introduced a Leaders of Managers program, as the second 
offering in its leadership-­transition suite of programs, for the managers of manag-
ers. It covers a number of core skills, including business acumen, strategy, collabo-
ration, talent management, and global mindset, and the course is a combination of 
leader-­led learning and business simulation.
As a highly diverse company, both geographically and sectorally, with twenty-­
two billion-­dollar brands, PepsiCo believes that the biggest impact of its leadership 
programs has been in helping managers to take a more global and cross-­functional 
approach—­giving them a greater understanding of the impact of decisions made at 
the local level on the rest of the company. The program has also assisted managers 
in building networks throughout the company outside of their own region and line 
of business.
IAMGOLD
IAMGOLD Corporation is a midtier Canadian gold mining company engaged inter-
nationally in mining and the exploration of gold. IAMGOLD has operations in 
North America, South America, and West Africa. The foundation of the company’s 
culture is a belief in engaging, empowering, and supporting employees to build a 
company where the pursuit of excellence and an industry-­leading vision of account-
able mining exist in harmony. IAMGOLD was facing a typical challenge. Survey 
data taken from its employee engagement survey was much lower than expected, 
indicating that the first level of management needed leadership help and pointed 
to a need for formal leadership development.2
In response to this, IAMGOLD Corporation designed and implemented its com-
prehensive Supervisory Leadership Development Program (SLDP). The objective was 
to build a leadership pipeline while developing supervisory capabilities to engage, 
empower, and support employees. The program was highly visible, linked to key busi-
ness objectives, and required substantial resources for the design and implementa-
tion, which covered a three-­year timeframe. The project involved fourteens days of 
leadership development coupled with 360-­degree feedback processes and a team of 
individuals to make it successful. In all, nearly 1,000 managers would be trained at a 
cost of more than $6 million. These factors and a need to measure program success and 
improvement opportunities led to an evaluation study using the ROI Methodology.
It is important to note that many of the supervisors in West Africa and South 
America lack formal education and many even have literacy problems. Consequently, 
SLDP was experiential in nature and offered creative, engaging activities for learners 
to explore and arrive at new meanings. Transfer of learning was built into the program, 
and each activity seamlessly linked to the next segment of learning. The program was 
delivered in three languages to meet the specific linguistic needs of each site.
The evaluation study found that the SLDP favorably impacted several of IAM-
GOLD’s key business measures, and a positive ROI of 46% was realized. Other 

226

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
intangible benefits not converted to monetary value included improving super-
visory effectiveness, which ultimately impacted employee engagement. From a 
program perspective, this evaluation highlighted the importance of top-­down lead-
ership development. With all of this in mind, IAMGOLD is now pursuing the devel-
opment of a Manager Leadership Development Program (MLDP). As the MLDP 
is implemented, pieces of SLDP will also be redesigned for use with the general 
employee population, ensuring effective sustainability of the program.
Global Leadership Is Crucial
In a world of strident shareholder demand, shifting business priorities, disrup-
tive innovation, rapidly changing demographic and geopolitical forces, regulatory 
changes, and increasingly competitive business environments, leaders who envi-
sion and execute today’s strategy as well as anticipate and prepare for tomorrow’s 
challenges are more critical than ever. Leaders are expected to demonstrate a 
deep understanding of their organization’s business as well as its products and 
services, master the nuances of global markets, and conduct themselves in ethical 
ways. They must respond quickly to competitive maneuvers, foster innovation, 
communicate a compelling vision, and develop not only their globally distrib-
uted teams but also the next generation of leaders, all while delivering long-­term 
value measured by short-­term results. Becoming such a leader is like reaching the 
Mt. Everest of leadership development—­and attainment is elusive. The results of 
failure to produce such leaders are often public, usually pronounced, and always 
profound.
Yet strong leaders can be developed if organizations, business leaders, and those 
who head leadership development functions create the systems, processes, involve-
ment, and accountability that are crucial to success. Some organizations seem to 
have reached the summit. Others struggle against the vertical climb. Still others 
remain unable to gain a foothold. It’s not going to get any easier.
Global Leadership Defined
What makes an effective, successful global leader? What does it take to be success-
ful, and how is that success determined? Is the success to be evaluated quarterly 
and based on results delivered to the satisfaction of analysts and shareholders? Is it 
to be judged by results delivered during the tenure in the role, over the course of a 
lifetime of leadership, or ultimately by the future success of the company, business 
unit, or team after the leader has departed? What role does character play in this 
examination of business impact? What characteristics and competencies of a leader 
distinguish the “best” from the merely “very good”?
As a core criterion, the expectation of leaders has always been to “get the job 
done” by managing assets and people in a complex global environment. Often miss-
ing has been a more holistic view of the process in terms of how to motivate, engage, 
reward, and lead employees.
Twentieth-­century research began to crystallize the way effective organizational 
leaders are viewed and subsequently developed. Few depictions of effective leader-
ship have withstood the test of time as well as that of Peter Drucker, who articulated 

Build Global Leaders
227
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
the eight core practices of the effective leaders he worked with over his sixty-­year 
career. According to Drucker, effective leaders do the following:
	 1.	 Ask, “What needs to be done?”
	 2.	 Ask, “What is right for the enterprise?”
	 3.	 Develop action plans.
	 4.	 Take responsibility for decisions.
	 5.	 Take responsibility for communicating.
	 6.	 Are focused on opportunities rather than on problems.
	 7.	 Run productive meetings.
	 8.	 Think and say “we” rather than “I.”
As he saw it, these questions “gave them the knowledge they needed . . .  helped 
them convert this knowledge into action . . . [and] ensured that the whole organi-
zation felt responsible and accountable.”3
Jim Collins offered that in addition to IQ and technical skills, these five emo-
tional intelligence attributes characterize the true leader:
	 1.	 Self-­awareness
	 2.	 Self-­regulation
	 3.	 Motivation
	 4.	 Empathy
	 5.	 Social skill4
“Level 5 leaders,” as he described them, credit others with success yet assume 
personal responsibility for failure. These leaders are characterized by humility and 
a will to succeed that does not tolerate mediocrity; they are quietly and calmly 
determined to succeed.
Over the years, we’ve seen the “one-­minute manager” joined by the “situational 
leader” and the “servant leader” and by those leaders who are “values driven,” “prin-
ciple centered,” and searching for “true north” or “multipliers.” While definitions 
will undoubtedly continue to evolve, the fundamental description of a leader as one 
who delivers results in a way that affirms, engages, inspires, and respects others is 
unlikely to fade from view.
The Forces for Effective Global Leadership
Effective global leadership is critical to the success, and often the survival, of cor-
porations. In recent years, we have witnessed the demise or serious crippling of 
companies because of the inability of leaders to competently and ethically lead, 
creating a breach of trust with the public as well as with employees. Newspaper 
headlines and, in some cases, high-­profile trials remind us of the failures of leader-
ship. They are not confined to a particular region or industry, as scandals surround-
ing such companies as WorldCom, Satyam Computer Services, Adelphia, Parmalat, 
Tyco International, Clearstream, Enron, Global Crossing, and Arthur Anderson can 
attest. While most companies do not make the headlines for their leadership fail-
ures, they are all accountable for business results.

CEOs Care About Leadership
In the years since the global financial crisis, companies and their leaders have been 
shifting from survival mode to a business growth approach. It is no wonder that 
leadership development was on the minds of CEOs around the world when they 
responded to The Conference Board’s annual CEO Challenge survey.5 When asked 
to rank their top challenges for the coming year, they ranked business growth first. 
The surprise was that, after an absence from the 2009 and 2010 “top ten” findings, 
talent emerged as the second-­most important global challenge; Asian CEOs ranked 
it number one, ahead of business growth. CEOs thought talent, innovation, and 
cost optimization would fuel business growth. When asked about the strategies 
CEOs would implement to address the talent challenge, these were the top ten:
	 1.	 Improve leadership development programs; grow talent internally.
	 2.	 Enhance the effectiveness of the senior management team.
	 3.	 Provide employee training and development.
	 4.	 Improve leadership succession planning.
	 5.	 Hire more talent in the open market.
	 6.	 Promote and reward entrepreneurship and risk taking.
	 7.	 Raise employee engagement.
	 8.	 Increase diversity and cross-­cultural competencies.
	 9.	 Flatten the organization, and empower leadership from the bottom up.
	10.	 Redesign financial rewards and incentives.
Even a cursory read of the top strategies indicates a focus on internal leadership 
(improving the existing internal leadership base, especially at the top of the house; 
up-­skilling all employees; improving leadership succession) before fighting for tal-
ent in the open market. In Asia, where talent was scarce before the global financial 
crisis, “hiring more talent in the open market” was ranked eleventh, with an internal 
development and retention focus being preferred, as qualified talent is both scarce 
and expensive. Asian leaders understand that they must build leaders faster than 
the global competition. Two things distinguish the approach of Asian companies: 
(1) attention to the specific developmental needs of the individual leader and (2) the 
speed with which they accelerate the development of key talent through experience, 
exposure, and customized training programs.6
Customers and Consumers Care About Leadership
We live in an age when maintaining an organization’s reputation and brand man-
agement is a constant challenge. Of the many ways corporate reputations are made 
and lost, few factors are more important than the quality of their leaders. Consumers 
are negatively influenced by headlines of errant and unethical behavior and pos-
itively influenced by lists of most-­admired companies, especially those touted for 
their strong managerial practices. Consumers and customers have strong brand 
affiliations, product dependencies (e.g., prescriptions or replacement parts), and 
business affiliations that would be difficult to replace, and they take note of leader-
ship behaviors. Knowing that raw materials are harvested in a sustainable way, that 
clothing is not manufactured by the use of child labor, that executives are not “tone

deaf” to the average citizen, and that the stock market is still a fair and level playing 
field is important to consumers. In a world of choices, they will provide feedback by 
remaining loyal to a brand or by choosing a competitor for essentially the same prod-
uct. They often share their thoughts and feelings among the members of their social 
networks with messages and postings that seem to never fade from the Internet.
Shareholders Care About Leadership
Those shareholders whose investment dollars and pension funds balance on the edge 
and are subject to mismanagement, lost revenue, and missed opportunity costs pay 
close attention. They are looking for superior returns and believe that those returns 
are the result of well-­run companies led by ethical leaders. Analysts agree. There is 
mounting evidence of a direct correlation between effective leadership and business 
results. In their examination of CEO performance at publicly traded companies, 
researchers found that the “best-­performing CEOs in the world” came from many 
countries and industries, and on average, those CEOs delivered a total shareholder 
return of 997 percent (adjusted for exchange-­rate effects) during their tenure. On 
average, these top fifty CEOs increased the wealth of their companies’ sharehold-
ers by $48.2 billion (adjusted for inflation, dividends, share repurchases, and share 
issues). Compare that to the fifty CEOs at the bottom of the list, who delivered a 
total shareholder return of −70 percent during their tenure and presided over a loss 
of $18.3 billion in shareholder value. Industry, country, and economic factors were 
accounted for, and each CEO’s background and the situation he or she inherited were 
certainly factors in judging success. Many on the list of successes are familiar names; 
numerous others are relatively unknown but tend to have been selected internally 
and have served longer in the role than the current average tenure of CEOs.7
Internal Stakeholders Care About Leadership
In an era of increased scrutiny of virtually all expenditures, accountability for 
the development of leaders, particularly at the top, will only increase. Significant 
resources continue to be devoted to developing leaders. The Association for Talent 
Development (ATD) estimates that, even in the midst of the global financial crisis, 
U.S. companies alone spent just under $126 billion per year on employee learning 
and development; slightly more than 10 percent of that expenditure was devoted 
to developing leaders and managers, and an additional 4 percent was expended on 
executive development.8 The inability to determine whether or not resources have 
been expended wisely cannot be sustained in most corporate environments, even 
when we intuitively believe that leadership development (along with all employee 
development) is a noble pursuit.
Current and Prospective Employees Care About Leadership
Effective leaders create a culture that serves as a magnet for attracting top talent. With 
each generation entering the workplace, a greater emphasis is placed on continual 
development, as these new employees know that they are unlikely to stay more than 
a few years; it’s about what they can develop, acquire, and take with them to the 
next stop in their career journey. We know that effective leaders are one of the most 
important influences on levels of engagement. Recent research reaffirms the correla-
tion between engagement and leaders’ ability to do the following:

230	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Develop a positive and significant relationship with each employee.
•	 Provide constructive performance feedback often.
•	 Coach employees.
•	 Provide opportunities to grow and develop.
•	 Set a clear direction—­at whatever level is appropriate.
•	 Communicate not only corporate strategy goals but also progress toward those 
goals.
•	 Act in ways that are consistent with words.
Higher rates of engagement translate into higher rates of retention, an import-
ant factor in retaining talent in an increasingly competitive job market.9 In a world 
in which fewer than one in three employees are engaged, trust in executives can have 
a significant impact on engagement.10
Other Stakeholders Care About Leadership
In an increasingly interconnected world, there are many stakeholders whose for-
tunes and fates are inextricably linked to successful leaders and the leadership 
development (LD) programs that create and support them:
•	 The families of employees who have offered their talents and energy in return 
for current compensation and, in many cases, future retirement and security
•	 Taxpayers called upon to “bail out” specific companies or even entire industries 
when economic stability hangs in the balance
•	 Industries that are enhanced by the reputation for good stewardship of out-
standing executives or forever tarnished by the actions of a few highly visible 
transgressors
•	 Communities that stand to benefit from business profits that are poured back 
into the community in the form of goods and services purchased from local 
companies, as well as scholarships, endowments, and sponsorships
•	 National governments whose ability to gather tax revenue from profitable, 
well-­run companies can mean the difference between national solvency and 
national bailouts
Current Status of Leadership Development
There is no doubt that leadership development is important, and it has changed 
dramatically in the past decade. Starting many years ago as typical classroom train-
ing on the principles of leadership, it has evolved into a critical part of organiza-
tional growth and development. How leaders are selected for programs and the 
specific ways in which programs are offered and structured are significant issues 
that define the current status.
How Leaders Are Selected for Development
Because leadership development can be one of the most expensive types of devel-
opment (it is not uncommon for it to be four or five times the expenditure made for 
other employees), selection is usually a thoughtful process.

Build Global Leaders
231
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
At higher levels in the organization, participants in LD programs are often 
selected by one or a combination of the following methods:
•	 Nomination by a manager
•	 Cumulative data from performance management systems and/or past talent 
review discussions
•	 Assessment results
•	 Individual assessment (including a 360-­degree instrument and/or psycholog-
ical profiles) and custom developmental plans based on the outcomes of that 
assessment
•	 Participation in an “assessment center” exercise
•	 Testing (the test needs to be subjected to validity and reliability checks to deter-
mine the value of administration)
•	 Behavioral or structured interviews
At lower levels, participants are often “selected in” versus “screened out” and 
enter into an LD program by virtue of a promotion or a change in job title. For 
example, all new supervisors may be automatically enrolled in a particular program.
How Leaders Are Developed
Lewis Carroll, in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, wrote, “If you don’t know where 
you are going, any road will get you there.” This is also true with leadership develop-
ment. Unless there is a clear road map, it is indeed a lovely journey but one without 
a destination or committed travelers. The methods for development are varied, and 
many are combined into programs and initiatives of infinite variety:
•	 Formal training, usually in a classroom (a virtual or “brick and mortar” one)
•	 Informal learning including self-­guided or structured content (books, online 
learning, audio/video podcasts, etc.)
•	 Action learning (with a focus on strategic planning or innovation)
•	 Job shadowing
•	 Coaching (either internal or external)
•	 Mentoring
•	 Experiential learning
•	 Stretch assignments
•	 Simulations
•	 Community involvement
•	 “Community of practice” or network involvement
•	 Short-­term rotational assignments
•	 Long-­term international assignments
Years ago, researchers created assignmentology, a way of mapping standard lead-
ership competencies to specific opportunities for development, such as serving on 
a task force, chairing a major initiative, or assuming a role with a greatly expanded 
scope. The science of knowing what developmental experiences will result in specific 
competency improvements (and, by extension, what will not) is an extraordinary 
global positioning system in a world of increasingly fewer marked paths.11

The Myth of 70–­20–­10
The time devoted to learning about leadership is a critical issue. For decades, there 
has been an assumption that 70 percent of the time should be spent on the job 
with actual experiences, 20 percent learning from others (usually through coaching, 
mentoring, shadowing, and role modeling), and 10 percent in formal leadership 
development programs (in the classroom, e-­learning, or blended learning). This 
ratio comes from leaders who were asked to reflect on how they learned effective 
leadership. As you can imagine, there has always been a small amount of time in 
classroom leadership development, so their input naturally reflected a small amount 
in the formal learning category. The rest of it was their best guess of what has hap-
pened—­it was never meant to be a prescription of what should be done! It’s safe to 
assume that there is not enough formal learning provided during a person’s career, 
at least in most organizations. A better approach is to ask leaders how they want 
to learn—­what their preference is. A recent study by The Conference Board and 
Development Dimensions International (DDI) involved more than 13,000 leaders, 
1,500 global human resources executives, and 2,000 participating organizations.12 
Figure 13.1 shows the results of this study. The 70–­20–­10 ratio is the perception, 
but the reality in terms of time spent for this group in learning about leadership is 
closer to 55–­25–­20. When this data was sorted for those individuals who have the 
highest-­quality leadership, the ratio is 52–­27–­21. While this reflects the reality 
of what is happening in organizations, the important issue is what is preferred. 
This same group was asked to indicate how much additional time they would 
like to spend on leadership development per month. The average response was 
that they spent 5.4 hours per month now, and they desired 8.1 hours, with a differ-
ence of 2.7 hours, almost an additional week for a year. When asked how they would 
prefer to spend their time, 76 percent of them said on formal learning, whereas 71 
percent said learning from others. Only 26 percent said they wanted to spend it on 
the job. These data clearly show what many have experienced: that the 70–­20–­10 rule 
does not reflect reality, and it should not be used to prescribe a process; it is merely 
a reflection on what has occurred in the past. It is much better to plan the proper 
mix around the needs of the organization and the needs of the leaders.
How Leadership Development Programs Are Structured
There will always be a need for a structured process of developing leaders. Simply 
dropping talented and successful individual contributors into the “manager’s chair” 
robs them of the opportunity to continue to be successful in a completely new sit-
uation. It also runs the risk of doing not only professional harm to the individual 
but also organizational harm to those he or she impacts. This critical juncture in 
a career should be carefully managed, and all stakeholders need to be involved for 
mutual success to occur. Deploying new leaders to different environments or chal-
lenging situations without careful planning and support is not a recipe for success. 
Simply hiring a new CEO from the outside without considering the cultural assim-
ilation challenges, as well as the internal communications and talent implications, 
is terribly shortsighted.
Most programs have one or more of these goals in mind for their leadership 
development programs and initiatives:

Build Global Leaders
233
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Assess the bench strength of the current leadership, and develop targeted plans 
to address deficiencies or placement issues for individuals as well as organiza-
tional talent gaps that could impact the execution of the strategy.
•	 Identify possible successors for critical roles.
•	 Enhance the effectiveness of current leaders by building specific competencies 
and/or reducing the potential for “derailers.”
•	 Accelerate the development of high-­potential and emerging leaders.
•	 Develop a strong leadership bench.
•	 Set standards of behavior and cultural norms.
•	 Leverage leaders’ ability to develop and engage their employees, leading to 
increased levels of productivity, engagement, and retention.
The structure and effectiveness of LD programs is highly variable and, on the 
whole, disappointingly ineffective. Research indicates that these programs are 
“immature,” according to a leadership development maturity model:

•	 “Inconsistent management training” is the lowest level of maturity, reflective of 
a program that lacks development process and has no involvement of business 
leaders but where content is available and viewed as a “benefit” to employees 
(47 percent).
•	 “Structured leadership training” is characterized by the development of com-
petencies and a clearly defined curriculum, where management begins to 
embrace and support initiatives and programs (27 percent).
•	 “Focused leadership development” is culture-­setting and future-­focused, 
where individuals are assessed and thought of as corporate assets and where 
the organization’s leadership needs are factored into the process (16 percent).
•	 “Strategic leadership development” is where development is championed by 
executives who take their own development seriously and all aspects of talent 
management are integrated (11 percent).13
So is anyone implementing leadership development well? Research by the Hay 
Group highlights many companies and their “best practices” approaches to leader-
ship development, characterized by the following:
•	 Strong executive involvement
•	 Use of tailored leadership competencies
•	 Alignment with the business strategy
•	 A “leaders at all levels” approach
•	 An integrated talent management strategy in which leadership development 
plays an integral role14
These findings are echoed in Fortune magazine’s list of the world’s most 
admired companies, which provides insight into the choices these companies 
make about leadership development. The Hay Group’s research also reveals the 
following about successful organizations:
•	 Ninety percent expect employees to lead, whether or not they have a formal 
position of authority.
•	 One hundred percent manage a pool of successors for mission-­critical roles.
•	 Ninety percent collect leadership development best practices from subsidiaries 
and share them across the organization.
•	 One hundred percent give all employees the opportunity to develop and prac-
tice the capabilities needed to lead.15
The structure of leadership development will naturally shift to reflect the orga-
nizational models it supports. As command-­and-­control hierarchies intersect with 
social networks and team organizational structures, so will formal, rigid develop-
ment programs morph into more flexible, customizable solutions for developing 
leaders. Rick Lash, director of the Hay Group’s Leadership and Talent Practice and 
coauthor of the “Best Companies for Leadership” study, notes the “significant shift 
away from hierarchical organizational operating models. . . .  Leadership in the 
twenty-­first century is about leading at all levels, not restricting it to title. As orga-
nizations become flatter, the best leaders are learning they must check their egos 

Build Global Leaders

at the door and become increasingly sensitive to diversity, generational, and geo-
graphical issues.”16
One such customized approach can be seen at Bristol-­Myers Squibb, which has 
found ways to customize leadership development through the use of blended learn-
ing, coaching, mentoring, and social networking.17
Managing Versus Leading
An important challenge in organizations is to increase the amount of time leaders 
actually spend on leading instead of managing. Leaders spend much of their time 
on classic management activities of planning, organization, and control. For exam-
ple, developing plans, controlling the budget, and handling administrative work 
are all more managerial activities. Leading involves skill sets that include interac-
tion with employees. Figure 13.2 shows a list of the critical skills identified in The 
Conference Board/DDI study mentioned earlier.18 These are very powerful skill sets 
that can make a huge difference in organizations. The study found that leaders who 
spent more time interacting are more effective at these skills:
•	 Coaching and developing others
•	 Communicating and interacting with others
•	 Developing strong networks/partnerships
•	 Fostering employee creativity and innovation
•	 Identifying and developing future talent
This has been a classic issue with organizations that value spending more time 
on managing and less time on leading. In this particular study, 41 percent of leaders’ 
time spent was spent on managing versus 25 percent on leading. However, lead-
ers preferred to spend 22 percent on managing and 40 percent on leading. The

challenge for organizations, therefore, is to encourage, and build environments to 
support, spending more time on leading, which is where most of the payoff will be.
Global Versus Local Leadership Programs
For global organizations, an important challenge is to determine who controls the lead-
ership development and talent development programs. In some organizations, the pro-
grams are dictated by the corporate headquarters to ensure consistency with the mission, 
vision, and values of the organization. At the opposite extreme, programs all are locally 
owned, developed in the countries where their leaders reside to address the needs and 
cultural issues in that area. Both of these extremes are not ideal. The better approach is 
to have a good balance of both corporate and local control. Certainly, corporate should 
be more involved in mid-­ to high-­level leadership development, whereas frontline 
leadership development should typically be a balance between local and corporate 
control. Succession planning, on the other hand, is a local issue, involving candidates 
in specific areas, and local leaders often know their areas best. Balancing leadership 
development is an important consideration in the human capital strategy.
Common Challenges in Implementing Leadership Development
For those of us who have labored in the leadership development field for years, 
the challenges of getting it “right” at any company are at once unique and yet quite 
common. The details may be different at each organization, but these common 
challenges are ubiquitous:
•	 No clear vision of what individual leadership looks like at the organization now
•	 No clear vision of what organizational capacity looks like now
•	 No clear vision of what leadership should look like in the future
•	 Failure to gain consensus and commitment from senior leadership about the 
leadership model, behaviors, and pertinent corporate policies
•	 Absence of accountability of leaders to develop others and lead by example
•	 Lack of specific, descriptive behavioral anchors that help leaders clearly under-
stand what is expected and accepted
•	 A patchwork of leadership development programs that do not link to each 
other or to other talent management practices
•	 Lack of clear definition of success for a program or initiative
•	 Absence of executive sponsorship, particularly by the CEO
•	 The perception that this is an “HR thing”
•	 Disconnection of leadership development from conversations and presenta-
tions about strategic direction and/or key performance indicators
•	 Lack of adequate resources to fully execute programs and initiatives
•	 An inability to articulate the impact of LD programs, initiatives, and resource 
deployments in business terms
The Success and Failure of Leadership Development
The success factors for leadership development are identified from the barriers 
and enablers of successful leadership development. When leadership development 

Build Global Leaders
237
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
is successful, the enablers to that success are identified and isolated. When lead-
ership development fails, the barriers that caused the failure are isolated as well. 
A failure does not necessarily mean that the program did not deliver a positive 
return on investment or even influence significant business impact measures. A 
failure is described as a program not living up to its expectations—­not achieving 
the established impact or ROI objectives. It could have been more successful if 
adjustments or changes had been made; it will achieve success if changes are made 
going forward.
The data for the success factors are identified in a variety of sources. The most 
important sources are the ROI studies conducted by the officers, consultants, 
associates, and partners of the ROI Institute. Each year, this team is involved in 
approximately 100 to 150 leadership development studies, and each study reveals 
important issues about failure and success factors. In the case of disappointments, 
the data show the cause of the disappointment (i.e., barriers that must change in the 
program to generate more success). From time to time, the ROI Institute conducts 
reviews of these studies to determine the general barriers and enablers to success. 
Failure is divided into three categories. In the worst-­case scenario, the studies are 
negative, delivering less value than the cost of the program. These are failures that 
present serious disappointments, and the lessons learned are very clear. The second 
category is when success has not been achieved at the minimal targets defined by 
the impact and ROI objectives. While these programs have positive results, they 
do not meet expectations; there are opportunities for improvement that will drive 
more success. A third category consists of programs that exceed the objectives and 
show additional potential. While these programs are successful, if adjustments are 
made, they can be more so. These adjustments are vital because maximization of 
the value delivered is always a goal of success.
These distinctions are made because the impact of leadership development, 
when properly designed and implemented, can be considerable, sometimes ranging 
from 300 to 1,000 percent return on investment. Consider the impact created when 
a leader changes his or her behavior and it affects the entire team. For example, 
for a first-­level team leader in a call center with twenty direct reports, the impact 
would be the improvement of the team. If productivity (e.g., call volume) improves 
because of the leadership development, the team’s productivity is measured. When 
the monetary value from the team’s improvement is compared to the cost of the 
formal learning for the team leader, the ROI value can be significant. In our experi-
ence at the ROI Institute, when this leverage or multiplicative effect is explained to 
chief financial officers, they understand the value of leadership development. Con-
sequently, we should expect high returns on investment from leadership develop-
ment; if they are not there, we should determine what can be done to improve them.
In addition to examination of ROI studies, research began with an examination 
of the literature, probing into both the failures and the success factors of leader-
ship development. Next, a survey was conducted with LD organizers: those who 
organize, coordinate, or facilitate leadership development and are often aware of the 
causes of failure. The survey data from 232 respondents are presented in Table 13.1. 
Barriers are ranked from most significant to least significant. For the most part, 
these results parallel what the ROI Institute team has uncovered in the analysis of 
its studies.

238

American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Table 13.2 presents the success factors for leadership development in check-
list form, in the order in which they normally occur in the LD process. Leader-
ship development facilitators, developers, organizers, and supporters can use this 
checklist to ensure that the proper processes are in place for success. These factors 
are developed from literally hundreds of studies on leadership development and 
through other research. Usually, three to six items are missing for any given program 
design, and these are often critical enough to inhibit the results.
What Does the Future Hold for Leadership Development?
The ability to develop leaders more quickly and efficiently will become a competi-
tive advantage for those companies who do this successfully. This concept of flexi-
ble and adaptive leadership is well suited for our turbulent times. One of the best 
crucibles for developing adaptive leaders is the military. Four principles have served 
military leaders well:
	 1.	 Create a personal link, which is crucial to leading people through challenging 
times.
	 2.	 Make good and timely calls, which is the crux of responsibility in a leadership 
position.
	 3.	 Establish a common purpose, buttress those who will help you achieve it, and 
eschew personal gain.
	 4.	 Make the objectives clear, but avoid micromanaging those who will execute 
them.19

Another core skill for future leaders will be the ability to thrive (not simply 
survive) in a permanent crisis; this VUCA world (VUCA is a term that originated in 
military circles, which means volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) means 
a never-­ending series of strategy refreshes, setbacks, and unexpected opportuni-
ties. Many believe that effective leaders in this environment will need to foster 
adaptation, embrace disequilibrium, and generate leadership at all levels of the 
organization.20
Where will we find such leaders? Some suggest that we expand our search to 
include different markets, emerging economies, and differing cultural values—­
finding leaders who have forged their leadership skills in the crucible of resistance 
to apartheid, the growth trajectory of emerging markets, or during stints with 
mission-­driven entities addressing humanitarian crises around the world.21 The 
models are there; the largest India-­based companies provide leadership lessons in 
terms of where and how they focus their energy and their emphasis on being trans-
formational leaders.22 So many types of experiential learning are finding their way 
into corporate leadership development programs at industry-­leading companies 
such as UBS and IBM.
Leadership development will morph and adapt, just as the leaders it attempts 
to create must do. But one thing will remain constant: the need to articulate the 
impact of such a major investment. The journey is always the same for leadership 
development; at the end of the day, learning to effectively lead people remains a 
transformational process. It is always about how willing someone is to make himself 
or herself the lesser so that someone else can be the greater.
Many approaches can be successful, given the right support, the right timing, and 
the right alignment with corporate imperatives. While setting the course is difficult, 
attaining the results is even more challenging. One study of leadership competencies 
that matter most for growth (which, according to the authors, constitute “the Holy 
Grail of corporate strategy”) reveals that great leaders are very rare indeed.23
Some companies have found a way. There is no one path; there is no one correct 
answer. There are, however, correct questions:

Measuring the Impact and ROI of Leadership Development
In a survey of leadership development practitioners, 368 surveys were sent out 
and 232 were received, for a response rate of 63 percent.24 Several lists of current 
practitioners were used to choose recipients who were actively involved in leader-
ship development. In every case, the job title included leadership development or 
reflected a manager or director responsible for leadership development. Most of the 
organizations were global, representing both public and private sectors.
Table 13.3 shows where leadership development is being evaluated, using the 
levels of evaluation as a reference. These levels are described in more detail in 
Chapter 14. As this table shows, a surprising number of these evaluations are at 
the business impact and ROI levels, exceeding expectations. Part of this could be a 
function of the global recession. The recession has led some organizations to step 
up their evaluation efforts, pushing evaluation up the chain of impact to the impact 
and ROI levels.
Figure 13.3 shows today’s ROI reality, as recipients responded to the question, 
“Is there an emphasis on ROI?” Surprisingly, 88 percent said yes. This dramatically 
underscores the concern about ROI during a global recession.

Figure 13.4 shows the drivers for ROI evaluation and represents data only from 
those who indicated there is a current emphasis on return on investment. Perhaps 
as anticipated, increased pressures for cost efficiencies dominated the rationale for 
ROI evaluation, which for the most part is a function of the current global compet-
itive situation and the remnants of the economic recession. The cost of the program 
is the second driver, which is consistent with the work at the ROI Institute. An 
impressive 29 percent indicated that top executives are requiring this now, which is 
also consistent with ROI Institute data. This survey clearly shows that the need for 
ROI evaluation is here, and many organizations are stepping up to the challenge of 
showing the value of their programs up to the impact and ROI levels.
Can the Impact of Leadership Development Initiatives Be Measured?
We believe the impact of LD initiatives can and should be measured. What counts, how-
ever, are not our opinions but those of the business leaders who support all the human

particularly the most expensive and higher profile LD programs. In a recent survey of 
Fortune 500 CEOs, 92 of 96 said that they wanted to see the business impact of learn-
ing programs, but only 8 percent see that happening at their companies now.25 In the 
same survey 71 of 96 (74%) wanted to see the ROI, but only 4% see it now.26 Other busi-
ness leaders are increasingly interested in “people metrics” and the alignment between 
people-­related data and business priorities, sales performance data, and revenue.27
Early research in human capital analytics paved the way for its application in 
the workplace. Some studied the impact of the consulting psychologist as a path to 
developing leaders who impact business results.28 Others found that without the 
ability to articulate the business impacts of programs and initiatives, the human 
resources function would have a very difficult time playing a strategic role.29 One 
study conducted research for The Conference Board with leading multinational 
firms, including BP, Colgate-­Palmolive, Bayer, Unilever, AstraZeneca, and UBS, to 
determine the ways in which the profession could articulate the business value of 
leadership development. Two others state that even intangibles can be measured 
and used to support the impact discussion.30 Research supports the critical need to 
demonstrate the return on investment of LD initiatives.31
This shift to analytics is well under way. At UPS, the use of metrics and data have 
driven decision making about programs and their effectiveness, as well as busi-
ness impact.32 Google’s metrics-­driven approach and analysis have helped create 
the culture-­specific leadership model that is now the foundation for leadership 
development.33 Companies as varied as Harrah’s Entertainment, Starbucks, Procter 
& Gamble, Limited Brands, and Best Buy have determined that they can compete 
on talent analytics and win.
Measuring Progress
An important step is to assess where the organization is now regarding the mea-
surement of leadership development and where it needs to be. Figure 13.5 shows the 
maturity stages for measuring the success of leadership development. Stage 1 focuses 
on measuring internal processes to make the leadership development more effective 
from the perspective of the designers, developers, or participants. The focus is on 
measuring who is attending, what topics are explored, and the time that they are allo-
cating to the process (Level 0). This also includes measuring reaction to leadership 
development, ensuring that it is relevant, needed, and necessary (Level 1). It also 
measures the extent of learning of new skills and new approaches (Level 2). Most 
organizations are moving beyond stage 1 and are at stage 2.
Stage 2 is where the focus is on measuring behavior change. Typically, the approach 
is to use 360-­degree feedback, where the current levels of behavior are measured 
going into a particular program and the changes are measured at some point later. 
This can also involve an organization-­wide measurement, where the 360-­degree 
assessments provide a profile of how others are perceiving the leadership behavior 
of managers and executives.
Some organizations have moved into stage 3, which connects leadership devel-
opment to important intangible measures such as teamwork, communication, coop-
eration, and decision making. These are not necessarily business measures in the 
organization, but they are actual concepts. These perceptions can be very important. 
However, for most executives, this is not enough to see the value from their perspective.

Build Global Leaders
243
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Many organizations have migrated to stage 4, where leadership development is 
connected to standard HR metrics of retention, absenteeism, job satisfaction, job 
engagement, complaints, grievances, accidents, and other HR-­related measures. 
This is pursued under the assumption that leadership development is more likely 
to translate directly into these “people-­related” measures.
The ultimate approach, taken by a few organizations, is to connect leadership 
development to business unit measures. This measurement is based on the assump-
tion that if leadership capability is enhanced, the team performance measures will 
improve. In essence, the programs start with the end in mind with clearly defined 
business needs. In the beginning of major leadership development programs, key 
business measures are identified that need to improve or change, using the leader-
ship competencies with the team. Then it is the new leader behavior that drives up 
performance. This is a very powerful process and will be a major trend in the future. 
More detail on measurements are provided in Chapter 14.
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
This chapter identified issues that are critical for developing global leaders. Every 
human capital strategy should have a major component addressing the need for 
global leaders. This strategy should develop these key issues:
•	 Investment in leadership development
•	 Types of programs involved
•	 Target groups
•	 Succession planning
•	 High potentials
•	 Leadership culture
•	 Global perspective

his chapter addresses the issues of analytics and big data in organizations. It 
begins with a brief history of analytics and how it evolved in the human cap-
ital area. The good news is that this is not new to the human resources function, 
but previous applications have been narrowly focused in a few progressive orga-
nizations. The chapter describes the fundamentals and types of data, a maturity 
model, and an analytics model that is systematic and replicable. The chapter also 
discusses the various challenges and issues of working with big data and analytics, 
and it offers a prescription for how to make it work in an organization. This is an 
important but challenging issue that can have tremendous payoffs.
Opening Stories
Analytics is a hot topic for any function in any organization. This is especially true 
for the human resources function. Here are two examples of how HR is addressing 
the use analytics and big data.
Force 12: Analytics and Big Data. The evolution of comput-
ing power with rapidly growing sets of data has created a need 
and an opportunity to use analytics and big data to help guide 
organizational decision making. Although most of the work in 
analytics was initiated in the marketing and technology areas, it 
has now moved in a big way to the human capital area because 
of the cost of human capital. With large numbers of employees 
and applicants, there are many big data applications. The chal-
lenge for organizations is to develop a human capital analytics 
practice that exploits these opportunities and solves the vari-
ous problems using a standardized, consistent methodology to 
drive decisions that affect the business. This is much easier said 
than done, and it starts with having a strategy connected to the 
issue of how to use analytics and big data.

Scripps Health
Scripps Health is a not-­for-­profit San Diego–­based healthcare system that is suc-
cessful on any dimension. The system, which includes five hospitals and 26 out-
patient facilities, treats almost 2 million patients annually. Scripps employs more 
than 13,500 employees and has been named one of “America’s 100 Best Companies 
to Work For” every year since 2008. The system also includes clinical research and 
medical education programs.1
Having enjoyed success over the past eighty years, Scripps is a financially sound 
and stable organization with AA-­rated bonds, one of only four healthcare organi-
zations in California to hold this distinction. The “people” part of their process is 
managed extremely well, enabling Scripps to provide efficient, quality healthcare. 
Scripps regularly appears on lists of admired organizations, the best places to work, 
and the best employer for certain groups. Executives place specific emphasis on 
corporate social responsibility with more than $370 million contributed to com-
munity service and charity care. Scripps is considered among the top providers of 
healthcare. For example, Scripps was named by Thomson Reuters2 as one of the 
Top 10 health systems in the nation for providing high-quality, safe, and efficient 
patient care.
The success of Scripps rests on the quality of its leadership and the systems 
and processes in place to make it an outstanding healthcare delivery organization. 
Scripps focuses significant efforts on sound financial processes, process improve-
ment projects, and a variety of initiatives to improve the quality of healthcare. 
Among the processes used by Scripps is the ROI Methodology, a process that shows 
the success of healthcare improvement projects using six types of data with stan-
dards and a process model. At least 20 of Scripps HR professional team members 
have achieved the designation of Certified ROI Professional as they continue to 
conduct ROI studies on a variety of HR processes to ensure that they are delivering 
value and quality healthcare and achieving a positive financial outcome.
Google
Google’s HR function has established credibility by having a clear understanding 
of the company’s functional, strategic, and analytic HR needs and by ensuring 
that the department is staffed accordingly, says Laszlo Bock, vice president of peo-
ple operations.3 When HR is compared to supply chain management, marketing, 
sales, and operations, there has not been as much rigor historically. In part, that is 
why the HR function has had a hard time getting a seat at the table.
Bock deliberately set out to hire staff with the skills that would allow the depart-
ment to play both operational and strategic roles. One-­third of the people come 
from traditional HR backgrounds. They’re outstanding HR generalists and an out-
standing compensation-­and-­benefits team.
The second third comes from strategy consulting firms. HR is seeking two 
things: great problem-­solving skills—­the ability to take a really messy problem, 
disaggregate it, and drive to data-­driven answers—­and really deep business sense, 
a deep understanding of how business actually works in the different functions.
This blend of specialists and generalists helps create powerful cross-­pollination. 
The HR team learns a tremendous amount about business and problem solving

from the consultants, and the consultants get very quickly up to speed on the pat-
tern recognition you need to be successful on the people side.
The final third, according to Bock, are people with advanced degrees in various 
analytics fields—­PhDs and master’s degrees in operations, physics, statistics, and 
psychology. They let HR run all kinds of interesting experiments and raise the bar 
on everything HR does.4
A History of Human Capital Analytics
HR’s need for data to influence decision making dates back to the 1920s, when per-
sonnel research set the stage for the development of measures of HR’s activities and 
performance. In the 1940s and 1950s, about the time HR became a legitimate and 
essential part of organizations, practitioners and researchers began to explore ways 
of measuring its contribution. In the years that followed, HR practitioners wrestled 
with measuring contribution and using data as a strategic lever. By the late 1970s, 
data collection and analysis became a routine part of some HR departments. Con-
siderable advancements in measurement and evaluation took place in the 1980s, and 
the 1990s saw more growth in this area. Since 2000, much progress has been made 
with HR relationship studies (macro), ROI analysis (micro), and predictive analytics.
Without question, the HR function, which includes a variety of activities, 
does contribute to organization success; the difficulty lies in selecting the right 
combination of measures and the best approach to develop an adequate analytics 
practice. When examining the history of ways in which organizations address this 
issue, the approaches vary, with some clearly more effective than others. Figure 14.1  
shows the progression of approaches used to demonstrate HR’s influence on

organizational success. Each one adds to the body of work, although overlap is pres-
ent in the techniques, processes, and focus of some approaches. A detailed compar-
ison of these approaches is available in numerous other publications, including the 
ROI Institute’s website (http://www.roiinstitute.net).
The starting point in human capital analytics practice is to determine the specific 
human capital measures to monitor. These measures provide insight into the status 
and health of the human resources function. They signal when additional HR pro-
grams are needed, and they serve as the baseline for measuring the progress and pay-
off of investing in a specific program or project. The most common set of measures 
monitored by leading organizations is presented in Table 14.1. This list represents 
measures cited in over a dozen current studies on human capital measurement.
Some of the measures presented in this table evolved from the beginnings of 
“personnel administration” to what is today known as human resources or human 
capital management. They represent measures that were tracked during the field’s 
infancy and are still tracked today. Although these measures have existed for some 
time, they are still important measures for understanding the nature, scope, and 
progress of human capital. The measures represent a balance of old-­economy and 
new-­economy organizations. Several measures are industry specific. For exam-
ple, safety and health measures may be an important issue where employees are 
routinely at risk for accidents, injuries, and illnesses. Service and knowledge busi-
nesses, such as financial services and software companies, would not necessarily list

these measures as a priority. Other measures, however, are critical to developing 
and emerging industries, such as innovation, leadership, and competencies.
Other references explore each measure category in terms of how it is developed 
and a few of the issues surrounding it.5 This discussion is based on the assumption 
that anything can be measured, regardless of how subjective or soft it may be. The 
challenge is to increase the accuracy of the measurement, ensuring validity and 
reliability of the measurement process.
Human Capital Analytics Maturity
As reported in a state of human capital report titled “False Summit: Why the Human 
Capital Function Still Has Far to Go,” human capital analytics is the linchpin of 
human capital investments.6 While organizations are embracing some of the tried-­
and-­true approaches described in the previous section, others have matured to a 
higher level of analytics by investing in capacity-­building through hiring and devel-
oping skills as well as taking advantage of technology. Also, the business questions 
driving the need for HR to advance with analytics are changing.
The Conference Board’s Human Capital Analytics (HCA) Research Working 
Group researched how organizations progress along the analytics continuum.7 
Using MIT Sloan Management Review / IBM Institute for Business Value research 
as the foundation for their own, the HCA Research Working Group developed a 
maturity model that reflects how HR functions advance in their human capital 
analytics practice.8 The HCA Research Working Group found that maturity occurs 
as organizations identify challenges and opportunities, apply various frameworks 
and techniques, and ultimately align key measures to business outcomes. Success-
ful maturity requires that HR professionals have a clear strategic context and engage 
with their key stakeholders. Even though an organization may reach the highest 
level of analytics maturity, it will always experience a need for the less mature 
practices. Organizations can identify with any position on a maturity model, with 
the true measure of progress defined by the human capital professional’s ability 
to traverse the ever-­changing analytics terrain. Human capital analytics maturity 
includes three types of analytics: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. Each type 
of analytics answers different business questions.
Descriptive Analytics
Descriptive analytics is the most fundamental level of analytics. It answers ques-
tions such as “What happened, and what is happening now?” Data from this type 
of analysis describe the conditions, people, and events as they were in the past or as 
they exist today. Descriptive analytics provides information useful in assessing the 
extent to which an organization is meeting its goals, as well as the extent to which 
employers are attracting the right candidates. An example of the use of descrip-
tive analytics is the application of comprehensive talent assessments describing 
job requirements, preassessments, and postassessments that give organizations 
information on their workforce, which they can then benchmark against others.
At a solution level, descriptive analytics help determine the value of programs 
as well as provide suggestions on how to improve programs so that they can provide 
greater value. Descriptive data are often captured on scorecards and dashboards so 

250	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
that HR leaders and professionals can easily describe to stakeholders essential HR 
measures as well as connections to business measures that reflect the investment 
in human capital.
Predictive Analytics
As mentioned earlier, over the past decades, efforts have been made to develop 
statistical relationships between key HR measures and organizational performance 
measures. Using historical or existing data as the basis, predictive analytics moves 
the human capital practice further so that HR leaders can answer questions such as 
“What could happen, and when could it happen?” Data from predictive analytics 
describe conditions, people, and events as they could be in the future and when they 
are likely to be that way. It is useful in helping organizations determine possible 
outcomes of particular HR activities and influences the decisions of stakeholders.
Jac Fitz-­enz’s research places predictive analytics in the forefront of the human 
capital conversation. Since 2008, his HCM:21 model has evolved into a six-­step 
approach that refines analysis and suggests effective actions:9
	 1.	 Assess the situation, external and internal.
	 2.	 Identify a key business opportunity.
	 3.	 Find the factors or forces that drive it.
	 4.	 Determine the scope: local or organization-­wide.
	 5.	 Design an intervention or invest.
	 6.	 Evaluate, recycle, or move on.
Prescriptive Analytics
The ultimate level of maturity with human capital analytics is prescriptive analytics. 
This form of analytics helps organizations answer questions such as “What is the 
best course of action?” Prescriptive analytics makes predictions in decision making 
while taking into account the impact of those decisions. It describes what is possible 
given particular factors and what courses of action would be optimal given all the 
potential combinations of options and outcomes. An example of prescriptive ana-
lytics can be found in the literature on workforce optimization. In The Conference 
Board’s research report, Human Capital Analytics @ Work, Volume 1, ABM, with 
the help of Mercer, developed a workforce-­optimization model that describes the 
optimum number of employees and activities a manager can handle and still drive 
profitability for ABM.10
Figure 14.2 depicts The Conference Board’s Human Capital Analytics Maturity 
Model as developed by the HCA Research Working Group. This model does not 
suggest that one level of maturity is better or worse than another. It simply demon-
strates the continuum along which organizations are moving as they advance their 
human capital analytics practice. This chapter is an effort to help organizations 
develop along this progression.
Types of Data
Although most organizations use some approach to placing similar types of mea-
sures together, a logical data categorization framework is needed that uses levels 

Use Analytics and Big Data
251
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
of data, recognizing that the next level is usually more valuable than the previous 
level from the perspective of the senior executive group. These levels are depicted 
in Figure 14.3.
Level 0 is inputs, which details the numbers of people and hours, the focus, and 
the cost of a solution. These data represent the activity around a human capital 
investment rather than the contribution of the solution. Level 0 data indicate the 
scope of the effort, the degree of commitment, and the support for a particular solu-
tion. For some, this information equates to value. However, commitment as defined 
by expenditures is not evidence that the organization is reaping value.
Reaction
Level 1 is reaction, which details how employees, associates, members, and other 
individuals connected to the organization react to a particular solution or project. 
These data, such as relevance, importance to success, appropriateness, usefulness, 
and intent to use, are important. They represent perceived value of a solution from 
the perspective of those involved in it in some way. Adverse reaction is often a clear 
indication that nothing will come of the solution—­that it will serve merely as an 
expense rather than an investment. For example, an employee referral program 
as a recruiting source can be successful or unsuccessful, based on the reaction of 
employees to that solution. If they think it is valuable and important, and it is 
rewarding for them to make the referral, they will do it. Otherwise, they will not. 
Another example is the reaction employees have to a new diversity and inclusion 
effort. Positive reaction that reflects commitment to it is a good indication the pro-
cess will be embraced as important to organizational strategy.

Learning
Level 2 is learning. Measures of learning ensure that the individuals involved in 
a solution have the knowledge they need to make a solution, system, initiative, 
or project successful. These data may represent knowledge, information, aware-
ness, and critical skill sets necessary for work to be done, programs to be implemented, 
and processes to be completed. Without the requisite knowledge, things can go 
awry. For example, almost 70 percent of employees in one of the largest healthcare 
organizations in Canada did not receive flu shots, although senior executives had 
requested flu shots for all employees. For a healthcare provider, it is important for 
employees to avoid the flu because they could be absent more frequently and may 
pass the flu along to their patients. At the same time, they may be exposed to the flu 
more than employees in any other occupation. Some analysis revealed that they did

not pursue the flu shots because of some misunderstandings and misinformation 
about the shots and their effectiveness. When employees became more enlightened 
and the misinformation was clarified, the percentage of employees receiving flu 
shots increased significantly.
Application
Level 3 is application and implementation, also referred to as behavior and imple-
mentation, which measures people’s actions, activities, and behaviors. Measures 
at this level are critical. Sometimes solutions break down or do not work because 
people do not do what they should to implement a solution successfully. Sometimes 
executives think that when something is not working, they want new behavior in 
place, suggesting that the new behavior will correct things, and often it does. An 
example is one describing Harrah’s use of smile frequency as a predictor of customer 
satisfaction. This simple behavior led Harrah to implement a program and thereby 
drive a key organization outcome measure.11 Behavior, action, and implementation 
represent critical measures that lead toward organizational performance.
Impact
Level 4 is impact. This category includes measures that are in the system and rep-
resent all types of business data. In most organizations, these measures exist by 
the hundreds, if not thousands, and they reflect the conditions of output, quality, 
cost, and time, which are major categories of any work in an organization. These 
measures usually define the problem or opportunity that initiates an analytics proj-
ect. For example, an excessive number of patient accidents may be the driver for an 
analytics project at a healthcare firm. Reduction in customer satisfaction and new 
customer accounts may be the drivers for an analytics project for a large financial 
institution.
ROI
Level 5 is ROI, the measure that reflects ultimate accountability. It can be expressed 
as the benefit–­cost ratio (BCR), the financial ROI expressed as a percentage, or the 
payback period (PP) that indicates how long it will take for the investment to pay 
for itself. Although other measures of financial return exist (e.g., return on equity, 
return on assets), BCR, ROI, and PP seem to be the most common measures and 
are most appropriate for measuring financial output of human capital investments. 
These data are the output of the process and represent an important part of ana-
lytics. Ultimately, many analytics projects lead to ROI and require a comparison of 
the benefits to costs.
Types of Analytics Projects
The variety of tasks, processes, and procedures involved in analytics is vast. Some 
analysts suggest that any type of analysis to understand, support, or improve human 
capital programs is an analytics project. However, it is helpful to think of projects as 
falling into five different but related categories. These categories are helpful because 
they represent typical existing studies that can easily be located, analyzed, and 
compared. Each category is described in detail in the following sections.

254	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Sometimes only one of these analytics processes is used. For example, an organi-
zation may recognize a need to understand the financial value of a measure before 
investing in a solution or initiative. On the other hand, it may be important to show 
the ROI for a particular solution. This analysis includes demonstrating causation, 
converting data to money, and comparing the output to the cost of the solution. 
Regardless of the analytics project, these five categories should encompass whatever 
type of analysis is required.
Converting Data to Money (Type 1)
A tremendous push to understand the value of measures is evident in most organi-
zations, and one of the best ways to understand value is to convert it to money. If it 
is something that needs to increase, such as engagement, executives want to know 
the monetary value of it. If it is something that needs to be eliminated or prevented, 
such as accidents or incidents, executives want to know the cost of each occurrence 
to understand the magnitude of the problem. One type of analytics project is to 
convert data to money. Some measures are easily converted, but others are “soft,” 
which means they are more difficult to value and require a more advanced analytics 
process. Soft data items include the following:
•	 Job engagement
•	 Job satisfaction
•	 Stress
•	 Employee complaints
•	 Health status
•	 Ethics
•	 Teamwork
•	 Networking
•	 Customer satisfaction
•	 Reputation
For example, an electric utility company wanted to know the monetary value of 
the stress created as the industry became deregulated. Utility teams had to be more 
productive and efficient. This push for productivity caused excessive stress among 
team members, and the executives were interested in having a better understanding 
of the monetary value of the problem.12
The good news is that work has been done by organizations to convert some 
common soft data measures into money. A classic example is that of Sears, where 
an HCA project connected employee attitude to customer perception and then to 
revenue.13
Showing Relationships and Causation (Type 2)
This type of analysis involves understanding the relationship (or lack thereof) 
between variables and involves correlation and regression analysis. For example, 
a question of interest may be “Does increasing employee engagement increase the 
likelihood that employees will work more safely, be more productive, or reduce 
errors?” Analysis for these types of questions attempts to see not only whether a 
correlation exists but whether correlation indicates a causal relationship. Typical 
correlations that are being pursued through the use of analytics are as follows:
•	 Job satisfaction versus retention
•	 Job satisfaction versus attraction
•	 Job satisfaction versus customer satisfaction

•	 Engagement versus productivity
•	 Engagement versus safety
•	 Engagement versus sales
•	 Engagement versus quality
•	 Organizational commitment versus productivity
•	 Stress versus productivity
•	 Conflict versus productivity
•	 Culture versus productivity
•	 Ethics versus profit
The opportunities are limitless in terms of exploring relationships inside an 
organization. In addition, this step looks for causation that might not be based 
on mathematical relationships. Sometimes other methods can be used to explore 
the cause of a problem or determine what will influence an opportunity. These 
different techniques are listed in Table 14.2. An important point of this step is 
that the cause of the problem reveals the solution—­the opportunity that needs 
to be developed.
Applying Predictive Models (Type 3)
Predictive models for projects are an extension of the relationship category. When 
relationships or connections are made, can they be used in a predictive way? The 
independent variable predicts the dependent variables. Here are some typical pre-
dictive relationships that have been established in organizations:
•	 Recruiting source predicts retention
•	 Selection test predicts safety performance
•	 Interviews predict absenteeism
•	 Values survey predicts early turnover
•	 Health-­risk status predicts absenteeism

•	 Absenteeism predicts productivity
•	 Benefits participation predicts retention
•	 Compensation predicts retention
Again, the opportunities are limitless in terms of developing these models. 
Sometimes the model involves a chain of measures so that one measure predicts 
another, and then that variable predicts another. The predictive model from Sears 
mentioned earlier connects job satisfaction to revenue growth. In this example, 
an increase in job satisfaction will predict improvement in customer satisfaction, 
which will predict a growth in revenue for the store. Results from the project show 
that a 5-­point improvement in the total job satisfaction drives a 1.3-­point improve-
ment on a customer satisfaction survey, which drives a 1.5 percent improvement 
in revenue growth. The profit margin is applied to the sales growth to develop a 
value-­added dollar figure. By way of this model, improvements in job satisfaction 
become a predictor of profit in stores.
Conducting Impact and ROI Analysis (Type 4)
A dominant type of analytics project involves showing the impact and ROI of a spe-
cific human capital program. These types of studies describe the reaction, learning, 
application, impact, and ROI for a particular solution. Executives find it helpful to 
understand the value of particular solutions. Most analytics projects lead to solu-
tions. Impact and ROI studies are usually reserved for those programs and projects 
that are expensive, important, and command executive attention. They can cover 
a variety of areas:
•	 Recruiting/selection
•	 Training/learning/development
•	 Leadership/coaching/mentoring
•	 Knowledge management
•	 Organizational consulting/development
•	 Policies/procedures/processes
•	 Recognition/incentives/engagement
•	 Change management / culture
•	 Technology/systems/IT
•	 Green/sustainability projects
•	 Safety/health programs
•	 Talent retention solutions
•	 Project management solutions
•	 Quality / Six Sigma / Lean Engineering
•	 Meetings/events
•	 Marketing/advertising
•	 Communications / public relations
•	 Public policy / social programs
•	 Risk management / ethics / compliance
•	 Flexible work systems
•	 Wellness and fitness programs

Forecasting ROI (Type 5)
Sometimes when major projects or programs are implemented, it is helpful to 
understand the potential payoff for the program before it is implemented. This 
assessment involves forecasting the impact that will be driven by the program, con-
verting it to monetary value, and comparing it to the proposed cost of the solution. 
A challenge with forecasting is to be as accurate as possible so that the forecast can 
be realistic and used for decisions. Of course, if a forecast is conducted as a require-
ment, follow up and make sure that the forecast has been achieved. Many major 
programs are now regularly subjected to forecasting:
•	 Wellness and fitness programs
•	 Flexible work systems
All Roads Lead to ROI
It is helpful to understand the importance of impact and ROI in the minds of the exec-
utives who fund a variety of human capital projects and programs. In discussions with 
these executives, the focus often shifts or evolves to the ROI issue. For example, an 
organization has invested a tremendous amount of money on employee engagement. 
Engagement is being measured with an employee engagement survey. Executives may 
ask, “What is the value of having more engaged employees?” or “If engagement scores 
increase, what outcomes can we expect?” These questions suggest that executives are 
interested in the monetary value. This is a Type 1 analytics project.
In order to answer the question, engagement program owners would have 
to connect engagement to money—­typically through an easy-­to-­value, hard data 
measure. The data may show that engagement is connected to gross productivity, 
which can be defined as revenue per employee. If engagement has been moved from 
a lower level to a higher level, the gross productivity movement can be pinpointed. 
These data are easily converted to money. Adding the profit margin shows the 
actual monetary contribution of the improvement in job engagement. This is a 
Type 2 analytics project. If the relationship is operationalized, after testing and vali-
dation, this is now a Type 3 project.
After showing the productivity improvement connection, the next question is, 
“So what is the ROI?” Answering this question requires comparing the monetary ben-
efits of improvements in gross productivity connected to engagement with the fully 
loaded cost of the engagement solution. This ROI analysis is a Type 4 human capital 
analytics project. Quickly, a request for Type 1 leads to Type 2, which leads to Type 3, 
and finally Type 4, the ROI. Sometimes executives, when reviewing a potential program 
for improving job engagement based on the initial assessment of the score, may ask for 
a value of forecasted ROI before they get started. This more detailed project would 
be a Type 5 human capital analytics project, a ROI forecast. Obviously, after the project 
is implemented, this would also require a Type 4 analysis, which shows ROI on a fol-
low-­up basis. When discussing almost any solution or human capital analytics project 
with executives, they often ask, “So what happens if we do it? What is the impact? 
What is the monetary value? What is the ROI?” All roads lead to ROI.

Big Data
The last decade has seen a tremendous number of discussions, articles, books, and 
speeches about “big data.” What is big data? Big data does not have an absolute, pre-
cise definition, but it has some common characteristics. One definition is offered as 
follows: Big data defines a situation in which data sets have grown to such enormous 
sizes that conventional information technologies can no longer effectively handle 
either the size of the data set or the scale and growth of the data set. The primary 
difficulties are the acquisition, storage, searching, sharing, analysis, and visualiza-
tion of the data.14 IBM, for example, suggests that the data generated by people and 
organizations within two years generates an amount equivalent to the data gener-
ated in all the previous years combined. This is exponential growth, and it can bring 
tremendous challenges in analyzing the data. Fortunately, computing power is now 
available to handle these large quantities of data systematically and efficiently.
What are the characteristics of big data? The first characteristic is size. Cer-
tainly large data sets—­with records in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, or 
millions—­fall into the big data category. Small data sets, involving a few hundred 
data points, would be considered in a smaller category. Big data also reflects the 
types of data. Some data are qualitative and others quantitative. Another issue is 
the fact that the data are often messy because they are not entered properly. With 
the various types of data, there are accuracy issues, accessibility issues, and clean-­up 
issues that must be addressed in order to turn messy data into usable data sets for 
analysis. Finally, there is the speed of the data generation. The data set changes 
rapidly, and incoming data are often more useful than old data in analysis.
Big and Not-­So-­Big Data Items
Huge data sets are common. For example, close to fifty billion pieces of content 
are added to Facebook each month, YouTube users watch more than two billion 
videos per day, Twitter users perform thirty-­two billion searches a month, more 
than 2.5 billion text messages are sent each day, five billion mobile phones are in 
use around the world, and Google processes close to ten billion searches a year. 
Obviously, these are big data items.15 Within most organizations, data sets are not 
at that scale—­but they are still large. Every organization has data about employees, 
transactions, customers, and external data sets that effect the organization. For 
example, Wal-­Mart has almost two million employees in the United States. Even 
in human capital, big data projects are beginning to become commonplace. Lowes 
Home Improvement stores developed a correlation between employee engagement 
and store sales.16 Nationwide Building Society in the United Kingdom took on a 

Use Analytics and Big Data
259
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
project to demonstrate a link between employee commitment, customer satisfac-
tion, and business performance by correlating data collected from employee sur-
veys, customer feedback, and sales figures.17
However, not all projects fall into the big data category—­in fact, most analytics 
projects will probably not involve big data. For example, when an insurance com-
pany explored the possibility of employees working at home, 350 employees vol-
unteered for the project. The company set up home offices with all the technology, 
data access, and data security that would replicate what was currently in the com-
pany’s offices. This relieved the company from requiring more office space, and the 
payoff of this project was not only a reduction in office expenses but improvements 
in productivity and retention. Because this project involved collecting data from 
only 350 people, though, it is not considered a big data project.18 Another project 
involved a large fashion retailer implementing a leadership development program 
for four thousand store managers. The analysis was to determine the success of a 
program with a sample of one hundred managers. These managers were involved 
in a program that required prework through e-­learning, live classroom modules, 
coaching, and virtual tools in the follow-­up process. The evaluation, all the way to 
ROI, represents a significant analytics project, but is not considered to be big data.19
Issues
Big data presents many opportunities but also many challenges. One of the chal-
lenges is that it requires more sophisticated technology, special platforms to handle 
big data options, and the computing power to go along with it. Big data also requires 
expertise that is often beyond the capabilities of the human resources function. 
Specialists are essential to make it work. Because big data is messy, it requires much 
clean-­up. Sometimes, the amount of time it takes to clean up big data to make it 
usable is not worth it. Big data also often ignores the causation between connecting 
variables. For example, the two projects described previously involved relation-
ships between variables. What is needed is not only significant correlation but also 
causation, and these two projects addressed the causation issue. Big data advocates, 
however, suggest that causation is not a major issue; they claim that if you run 
enough big data analytics with all the variables, the strongest correlations will often 
suggest causation. This may or may not be the case. Because big data sets require so 
much work to analyze, it might be wiser to address the issue of causation directly.20 
Finally, the use of big data often ignores the whole issue of sampling. Sampling is a 
critical part of viable fiscal analysis, and much of the human capital analytics will 
involve working with small samples.
Even with these challenges, big data is an important part of the process. Having 
made the distinction between big data and not-­so-­big data, we will now discuss the 
analysis that is used with both.
The Development of the Human Capital Analytics Model
Although much progress has been made, human capital analytics is not without its 
share of problems. The mere presence of the process creates a dilemma for many 
organizations. When an organization embraces the concept and implements a 
human capital analytics practice, the management team usually anxiously awaits 

260	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
results, only to be disappointed when they are not readily available. For the process 
to be useful, it must balance many issues, such as feasibility, simplicity, credibility, 
and soundness. More specifically, three major audiences must be pleased with the 
practice to accept and use it:
•	 Team members who design, develop, and conduct the projects need a simple, 
user-­friendly process.
•	 Senior managers, sponsors, and clients who fund, initiate, and support projects 
need a credible outcome based on a conservative process.
•	 Researchers, professors, and critics who must support the analysis need a 
proven process that is logical, reliable, and valid.
To satisfy the needs of these three critical groups, the process must meet ten 
essential criteria for an effective human capital analytics model:
	 1.	 The process must be simple—­devoid of complex formulas, lengthy equations, 
and complicated methodologies.
	 2.	 The process must be economical and must be implemented easily.
	 3.	 The assumptions, methodology, and techniques must be credible.
	 4.	 From a research perspective, the process must be theoretically sound and based 
on generally accepted practices.
	 5.	 The process must account for other factors that have influenced output 
variables.
	 6.	 The process must have the flexibility to be applied to a wide range of situations.
	 7.	 The process must be applicable with all types of data, including hard data (out-
put, quality, costs, and time) and soft data (job satisfaction, engagement, and 
customer satisfaction).
	 8.	 The process must include the costs of the solution, when costs are needed.
	 9.	 The actual calculation must use an acceptable ROI formula.
	10.	 Finally, the human capital analytics process must have a successful track record 
in a variety of applications. In far too many situations, models are created but 
never successfully applied. An effective HCA process should withstand the wear 
and tear of implementation and should get the results expected.
Because these criteria are considered essential, a human capital analytics pro-
cess should at least meet the vast majority of them, if not all. The bad news is that 
many processes do not meet these criteria. The good news is that the human capital 
analytics model and process presented in Figure 14.4 meets all the criteria.21
Define the Problem/Opportunity
The first step is to define the problem, making sure that the business measure or 
measures linked to the project are clearly defined or the phenomenon is clearly 
described. The issue here is to clearly describe a problem or opportunity that must 
be addressed to make the project successful. Sometimes, initial problems or oppor-
tunities are presented to the human capital analytics team in vague terms. The 
challenge of this step is to make sure that it is a problem worth solving or an oppor-
tunity worth pursuing.

Review Research and Set the Hypothesis
When the problem is clearly defined, the question is, What do we expect to occur? 
For example, is job satisfaction related to attraction? Does job engagement relate 
to an increase in sales? These expectations are established as a hypothesis or, some-
times, multiple hypotheses. A hypothesis can be written mathematically, but it is 
often stated in simple terms to executives. The key is to anticipate expectations 
early in the process.
Address the Alignment Issue
Alignment ensures that the project is connected to important business measures 
throughout its implementation. Chapter 4 introduces the alignment of needs with 
objectives and evaluation. A human capital analytics project fits into the model at 
some point, as alignment can occur in several levels. Although this issue is addressed 
in step one, the alignment process keeps the focus. It may require detailed analysis, 
whereas other times it may be a quick conclusion based on the data. Alignment is 
critical at the business level, where specific business measures are identified in the 
beginning.
Plan the Project
Any analytics project will need a plan, maybe several of them. Planning is critical to 
ensure all key issues in the study are addressed, including making initial assump-
tions of how the project will unfold. Of the four types of plans, the first is the data 
collection plan, describing methods of data collection, sources of data, and timing 
of data collection. The second plan, the analysis plan, indicates what particular 
types of analyses are planned and how they will be used in the project. The third 
plan is the communication plan, detailing how the results will be reported to a 
variety of audiences and important topics with HCA projects. The fourth plan is 
the classic project plan that indicates the timing of the project from the beginning 
until the results are communicated and actions are taken. Proper investment in 
these four plans will make the entire project much easier.
Collect Data
Every human capital analytics study will involve collecting data. Data collection 
ranges from monitoring the data in the system to using questionnaires, interviews, 
focus groups, and observation. This step involves all the methods from the plan, 
which are now fully initiated.
Analyze Relationships, Causation, and Attribution
When trying to understand a problem, it is necessary to isolate the true cause from 
all the other factors, which moves beyond correlation. This step involves quantitative 
methods such as hypothesis testing and experimental design or qualitative meth-
ods such as problem solving or brainstorming. When a solution is implemented 
and improvement in a business impact measure has occurred, the question is how 
much of the improvement is actually connected to the solution. This critical step of 
attribution isolates the effects of different processes from the solution. It is necessary 
for accuracy and credibility. Several methods are available to accomplish this step.

Use Analytics and Big Data
263
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
Select the Solution and Set the Objectives
This analysis can come at different times, but at some point, a solution is needed. 
It could come early, after using descriptive statistics, or it can come after detailed 
analysis points to what exactly caused the problem. The solution is implemented to 
improve one or more impact measures. A variety of tools and processes will be used 
to ensure that this is the proper solution to address the problem or opportunity in 
the most economical way. An important part of this step is to set the objectives at 
different levels.
Calculate Monetary Benefits, Costs, and ROI
Sometimes a project involves converting data to monetary value. From a client per-
spective, the best way to understand a problem or an opportunity is to convert it 
to money, based on additional profits, reduced costs, or avoided costs. There are a 
variety of techniques available for converting data to money. This step is necessary 
if the project includes ROI analysis. When a solution is implemented, it is helpful to 
understand the impact of the solution in monetary terms, converting data to money 
at a later step in the process through a variety of techniques.
Sometimes it is necessary to develop the full cost of a particular human capital 
solution. For example, executives may ask for the total cost of wellness and fitness 
in terms of coordination, administration, equipment, facilities, programs, and even 
time for those who are involved in this process. These costs are necessary for a ROI 
calculation, in which the monetary benefits of the program are compared to all 
the costs. In either case, all costs must be included, both direct and indirect costs.
Forecast, Test, Predict, and Optimize
Sometimes the ROI forecast for a particular solution or the forecast of success from 
a predictive model may be needed. In today’s climate, executives want to know 
whether a solution will work before it is implemented. This step also involves a 
predictive model at the impact level, testing the model for feasibility and accuracy, 
optimizing it, and exploring what can be done to maximize the impact and ROI.
Report Results and Drive Improvement
Any human capital analytics project involves many stakeholders. The challenge is to 
make sure that all stakeholders have the data and results, understand their role in 
achieving them, and know how to make improvements or adjustments. Some audi-
ences need detailed information; others need brief snapshots. The key is to identify 
the appropriate audience, select the appropriate methods, and deliver a message 
that helps them achieve and understand the results. This final step includes driv-
ing improvements using results from the analytics project. These results are used 
to make adjustments. The key is to use the data to drive the improvement or the 
change desired and follow through to make sure that has happened.
Manage and Sustain the Analytics Practice
A variety of issues and events will influence the successful implementation of 
human capital analytics. Because this is such an important topic, specific topics or 
actions are presented later in this chapter:

264	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
•	 Meetings and formal sessions to develop staff skills with human capital 
analytics
•	 Strategies to improve management commitment and support for human cap-
ital analytics
•	 Mechanisms to provide technical support
•	 Specific techniques to place more attention on results
Human capital analytics can fail or succeed based on these implementation issues.
Human Capital Analytics Standards
Standards serve as the foundation for implementing the human capital analytics 
model. To ensure consistency across studies, the operating standards have been 
developed and tested in practice. The results of a human capital analytics project 
must stand alone and should not vary based on the individual who is conducting 
the study. The operating standards detail how each major step and issue of the pro-
cess should be addressed. To date, sixteen standards have been developed:
	 1.	 Align projects to business measures.
	 2.	 Use the simplest statistics in the human capital analytics project.
	 3.	 When collecting and analyzing data, use only the most credible sources.
	 4.	 When analyzing data, select the most conservative alternative for calculations.
	 5.	 If no improvement data are available for a population or from a specific source, 
assume that little or no improvement has occurred.
	 6.	 Omit extreme data items and unsupported claims from the analysis.
	 7.	 Address causation in problem-­solving analysis.
	 8.	 Use at least one method to isolate the effects of the solution.
	 9.	 Adjust estimates of improvement for the potential error of the estimate.
	10.	 When a higher-­level evaluation is conducted, collect data at lower levels.
	 11.	 When an evaluation is planned for a higher level, refrain from being too com-
prehensive at the lower levels.
	12.	 Use only the first year of benefits (annual) in the ROI analysis for short-­term 
solutions.
	13.	 Use fully loaded costs for human capital analytics projects.
	14.	 Define intangible measures as measures that are not converted to monetary 
values.
	15.	 Communicate results of human capital analytics projects to all key stakeholders.
	16.	 Use results of human capital projects to drive improvements.
These specific standards not only serve as a way to consistently address each step 
but also provide a much-­needed conservative approach to the analysis. A conserva-
tive approach will build credibility with the executive audience.
Challenges and Opportunities
When human capital analytics practice is working, there are some potential 
challenges that can be quickly turned into very profitable opportunities. These 

Use Analytics and Big Data
265
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
challenges are also an important part of maximizing the value of the human capi-
tal analytics practice.
Culture and Analytics
Ideally, a human capital analytics practice is created because of a culture of ana-
lytics among the leadership of the organization. In most cases, it is the interest 
of the leadership of the organization, as they see the power of analytics in other 
functions, which has led to the creation of the human capital analytics practice. 
But this is not always the case. In some cases, it is the chief human resources officer 
who has convinced executives to fund the analytics practice. Either way, it needs to 
be supported by executives who see the value of having and using analytics. This 
leadership role is developed in many organizations and can be developed over a 
period of time.22
Analytical leaders are those who get involved in data and analytics in a big way. 
They often push for more data in analysis. They lead from the front, trying to role 
model the best practice. They recruit the smartest people and believe in account-
ability. They never give up. They set strategy targets, and they use analytics wisely. 
If this type of leadership is not already in place, the leader of the HCA practice must 
help develop that leadership. This will be accomplished by ensuring that the human 
capital analytics practice is fully functioning.
Intuition Versus Data-­Based Decision Making
There has been much discussion about the value of intuition (sometimes referred 
to as “gut feelings”) versus decision making based on data. Human capital analytics 
may push decision making entirely on the basis of data and not bring in intuition or 
gut feelings. This should not be the case. Both data and intuition are needed. In a 
recent study by the Corporate Executive Board that assessed five thousand employ-
ees according to their ability to balance judgment and analysis, 19 percent were 
found to rely on intuition, seldom trust analysis, and make decisions unilaterally. At 
the other extreme, almost 43 percent relied on value consensus from analysis over 
judgment. In the middle, 38 percent apply judgment to analysis, listen to others, 
and invite a variety of opinions.23 The conclusion is that there is room for both. Data 
are an important part of the process and an important part of decision making, but 
they do not supplant or replace good judgment.
Optimization and Allocation
The goal of many human capital solutions is to optimize the effects on outcomes. 
As the ROI calculation is developed, these questions should be asked: What adjust-
ments, changes, or other assumptions could be made so that the outcomes are 
enhanced? What levels of optimization can be achieved? The answers involve three 
different scenarios:
	 1.	 Adjust the guiding principles. The guiding principles, presented earlier, are con-
servative. Sometimes critics will argue that they are too conservative. Different 
assumptions can be made, without changing the standards, to see the effects of 
other scenarios. For example, for a short-­term solution, one-­year impact data 
are used. Sometimes, however, it is debatable whether a solution is long term or 

266	
	High-­Impact Human Capital Strategy 
American Management Association • www.amanet.org
short term. Multiple years may be entered to show how the ROI changes. This 
approach helps in understanding what may eventually occur as these standards 
are adjusted. It is important to report value using the standards and then report 
other scenarios, if different assumptions are made.
	 2.	 Consider changing the benefits side. In a ROI calculation, the impact measure 
is converted to money to produce the benefits for the numerator. Although 
in a predictive model or estimated forecast, the impact measures are specific, 
every model has room for improvement. It may be helpful to make adjust-
ments to improve outcome measures to see the different effects they may have 
on ROI.
	 3.	 Consider changing the cost side. The denominator of the ROI calculation is the 
cost of the solution. The standard is that all costs are included, both direct and 
indirect. Although some of the indirect costs may be subject to debate, they 
should be included. One way to optimize the process is to examine ways to 
lower cost. If costs are lowered, obviously the ROI goes up, so adjusting these 
cost values shows different variations of the outcome.
Optimization can occur on a forecast to show what may be possible as different 
assumptions and changes are applied and the ROI is developed. On a postsolu-
tion ROI, changes in the inputs can be made. For example, changes in the design, 
development, and implementation of the solution can drive improvements. These 
changes show what can be done (and should be done) to make the results better, 
particularly when the initial results are disappointing. On a positive note, most 
solutions deliver positive ROI values, sometimes even high values. Optimization 
lets us examine what we must change to make ROI even more valuable.
With optimization comes the next stage: allocation. Optimization may tell you 
which programs add the most value, and it may mean that more resources need 
to be allocated to those programs. It may indicate the way in which programs are 
delivered to add the most value, and this may mean that allocations are more con-
nected to that delivery system. Optimization is a natural driver to allocating the 
proper resources to optimize the output. When this is achieved, the human capital 
analytics practice is adding tremendous value to the organization and helping to 
drive some of the key business decisions.
How to Develop the Practice
Now comes the big question: “How do we actually develop the practice?” Although 
many human resources functions are well into this process, it is helpful to reflect 
on how the practice is developed. For those organizations already in the process, 
readjustment and review may be needed. The reality is that every human resources 
function will have part of this in development now, typically under the heading of 
research, evaluation, measurement, metrics, or another term. Reporting is taking 
place now, and technology is being deployed. But the push is for the human capital 
analytics function to make this a more powerful part of the process, and it is help-
ful to think of this evolution as preparing for the launch of the practice and then 
sustaining it after the launch. Here are eight things that must be done before the 
practice is launched and eight things that must be done after it is launched.

Use Analytics and Big Data

Before the Launch
Funding is usually provided to develop the practice before it is actually launched. 
The launch occurs when the notice is sent to executives that the capability and 
processes are in place to tackle critical issues in the HR area—­that it is now open 
for business. But before that, eight steps must be taken:
	 1.	 Build the team. The human capital analytics team must be developed or 
acquired to provide the expertise necessary to make it work. The team often 
has four important skill sets:
•	 Human resources
•	 IT data systems
•	 Operations and support
•	 Statistics, math, and operations research
The key is to have a good cross-­section or balance of these skills. There 
can be too many analysts or not enough. Usually, the missing pieces are IT data 
systems experience and statistics, math, and operations research experience. 
A recent survey conducted by the ROI Institute and Vestrics showed that in 
current human capital analytics practices, 53 percent have HR staff in statistics, 
math, and operations research, and 58 percent have staff in IT.24 The number of 
staff will vary with the organization and what is intended. The average staff is 
approximately three, with much variation depending on the size of the organi-
zation. The budget also varies, and it is often helpful to fix the budget as a per-
centage of the total human resources budget. The current average is between 2 
and 3 percent, but it should be closer to 5 percent of the budget.
	 2.	 Address the technology issues. The first issue is selecting the platform to use 
to make the practice work. It could be a dedicated process available from SAP, 
SAS, SPSS, or Cognos, or it may be a standby process that has been around for 
some time, like Excel or Minitab. In the recent study from the ROI Institute 
and Vestrics, Excel was the number-­one platform. The advantage of Excel is 
that you can build on current processes that are already in place and not have 
to invest a tremendous amount of money in a new platform. This step will 
also involve making sure that the systems and databases are accessible and 
can relate to each other properly. Unfortunately, with different legacy systems 
in use, data collection and integration may be a problem. This step is a huge 
challenge and often baffles teams as they start. With the help of IT, it must be 
tackled quickly so that work on HCA projects can get started.
	 3.	 Review data issues. This involves a quick review of the availability, accessibility, 
and integrity of the data. Sometimes, the HR team may not understand the 
data sets. This is where other functional areas, such as operations support, 
quality, and IT, can help ensure the data are accessible to the HR function. The 
quality of data may be out of their control, and HR may have to live with the 
data available to them, even if it is inadequate or incomplete.
	 4.	 Review and adjust reporting. Current reporting practices may need to be updated.
	 5.	 Secure funding. Some initial funding will need to be provided based on an 
estimate of what will be accomplished and the resources needed. That will be 
adjusted as the group delivers value.

	 6.	 Select or develop an analytics model. The model presented in this chapter is a 
systematic, conservative approach based on a logical framework, and it is used 
by hundreds of organizations.
	 7.	 Create simple project-­selection rules. It is important to decide which projects 
to undertake. Dividing the projects into the five types detailed in this chapter 
is a helpful way to categorize projects and to see the value of them.
	 8.	 Plan the process. The process must have a project plan or a timeline of expecta-
tions and resources needed. The key is to not wait for perfection—­waiting until 
all data are accurate or all technology speaks to each other—­but to get things 
moving quickly.
After the Launch
The team must move quickly to deliver successes. The important issue is to be 
professional, engaged, capable, timely, efficient, and effective. This translates into 
eight important steps:
	 1.	 Respond to the executives. After all, the executives provided the funding, and 
they want to see results. If projects appear to take too many resources, they may 
be put off until later. The resources needed to make projects work need to be 
addressed, and it may be that the request is something that cannot be accom-
plished in a reasonable time frame. The key issue is to develop basic criteria 
around requests at this time.
	 2.	 Look for high-­value opportunities. Some projects can deliver great value, and 
others cannot. Simple forecasting can often help reveal the value. If there is 
a huge retention issue for critical talent, you can bet that it is a high-­value 
project.
	 3.	 Start with business needs. Every project should be related to a business need. 
These are impact measures usually involving key measures of output, quality, 
cost, and time. They are the important measures that will attract the attention 
of the executive group.
	 4.	 Stay on track. Although this is obvious, it often causes problems with teams. As 
they get started, they see other possibilities for other projects, one thing leads to 
another, and things can easily go astray down a bunny trail. The key is to stay on 
time and within cost, perhaps using project management tools to make it work.
	 5.	 Position projects for action. All this work is being done to deliver results and 
take action, and it should be positioned that way. A decision needs to result 
from each project.
	 6.	 Focus on presenting results. The presentation of the results is often underval-
ued and underdelivered. A compelling case for action needs to be made, and it 
may require a live briefing with the executive team. Beyond that, quick, easy-­to-­
understand presentation techniques are useful, such as dashboard scorecards 
and one-­page summaries with visualizations. The key is to not get bogged down 
in analysis that executives will not understand.
	 7.	 Strive for quick successes. Quick means that the team can do it in a reasonable 
time frame—­certainly within the first year of the launch, though a few months 
would be better. Successes lead to actions that please the executives. The results 
from those actions are also important.

Use Analytics and Big Data
269

	 8.	 Manage and sustain the practice. As a summary, Figure 14.5 contrasts the dif-
ferences between a practice that is doomed to failure and another destined for 
success. The key is to work on the right of the chart.
Implications for Human Capital Strategy
This force, the last of the twelve forces, is fitting to conclude with because it provides 
a vehicle for showing the value of addressing the other eleven forces. Using analyt-
ics and big data possibilities can make a huge difference. The team must develop 
a human capital analytics practice that is designed to deliver results and position 
itself for success quickly and consistently. To achieve this, these issues should be 
addressed in the human capital strategy:
•	 The creation and support of the HCA practice
•	 The development or adoption of an HCA model with standards
•	 The process for selecting HCA projects
•	 The funding formula for the practice
•	 How to build on successes with optimization and allocation
Unsuccessful human  
capital analytics practice
Successful human  
capital analytics practice
	 1.	 Sparse resources and inadequate funding
	 1.	 Fully funded with ample resources
	 2.	 Skill gaps exist among the team members
	 2.	 Highly skilled team with complementary 
skill sets
	 3.	 No model or systematic process
	 3.	 Proven approach and process
	 4.	 No clear way for selecting projects for 
analysis
	 4.	 A systematic way for selecting critical 
projects for analysis
	 5.	 Disorganized project teams
	 5.	 Great project management skills
	 6.	 Inefficient project teams
	 6.	 Efficient teams with on-­time project 
completion
	 7.	 No consistent way of presenting results 
to executive team
	 7.	 Great presentations to executives, includ-
ing live briefings
	 8.	 Projects not always positioned for action
	 8.	 Projects positioned for immediate actions 
and/or decisions
	 9.	 Few successes
	 9.	 Several major successes each year
	10.	 Weak and uncertain manager support
	10.	 Strong support from the management 
team
	11.	 Weak and inconsistent executive 
commitment
	11.	 Strong and consistent executive 
commitment
	12.	 Weak credibility, influence, and respect
	12.	 Strong credibility, influence, and respect

About the Authors
Jack and Patti Phillips bring significant experience to this book. Together they have 
more than forty years of actual business experience, with much of that in the human 
resources area. For example, Jack spent fifteen years as head of HR in organiza-
tions, including a Fortune 500 firm. Patti headed up HR in a smaller firm. Together 
Jack and Patti have won several awards for their work, particularly in the human 
resources area. Jack has appeared on the cover of Human Resource Executive Mag-
azine, highlighting his work while he was the head of HR for one organization. The 
Society for Human Resource Management gave Jack its highest award for creativity, 
recognizing his work in bringing accountability to human resources. The American 
Society for Training and Development has recognized Jack’s work with its highest 
award of “Distinguished Contribution to Workplace Learning and Development.” 
The International Society for Performance Improvement has recognized Jack by 
electing him president of the organization.
Jack and Patti have written more than twenty-­five books in the HR area, includ-
ing books that focus on investing in human capital, proving the value of human 
capital, and human capital analytics, among others. Together they routinely make 
presentations at international conferences around the world, speaking on the top-
ics of human resources and human capital, especially accountability in human 
resources and the importance of investing in human capital.
With the ROI Institute, consulting often takes them directly to top executives, 
including chief human resources officers. Collectively, Jack and Patti have taught 
more than twenty thousand managers and executives about the importance of 
human capital and accountability in the human capital investment.
Finally, they have conducted research into understanding the different human 
capital issues. Both of their PhD dissertations (and master’s theses) have focused 
directly on this issue, and their research work extends through the ROI Institute. 
Their combination of practical experience, insightful research, extensive writing, 
and consulting practices create an ideal background and experience for this new 
publication.

INTRODUCTION TO  
TALENT LEADERSHIP
In today’s challenging economy, leaders at all levels are facing enormous chal-
lenges when it comes to achieving and sustaining breakthrough operating re-
sults. Globalization, economic change, more stringent regulation, and tougher 
governance make realizing shareholder value increasingly difficult. But there 
is another challenge: In a breakthrough executive trends global research study 
I conducted with my colleague, Bonnie Hagemann, which was published by 
Pearson in 2011, we clearly confirmed that identifying and developing high-po-
tential and emerging leaders is and will continue to be one of the top business 
issues facing CEOs; 40 to 70 percent of all executives in most organizations will 
become eligible for retirement in the next five years.
In our increasingly knowledge-driven world economy, organizations are 
right to fear this imminent brain drain, suspecting that, when executives leave 
the firm, business may follow. Yet high-potentials and emerging leaders—those 
most likely to rise to fill those highest positions—account for less than 8 to 10 
percent of the talent pool. That’s in the United States. In other countries, like 
Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, and China, and in just about 
every country except India and various countries in Africa and South America, 
this issue is as pronounced as it is in the United States, if not more so. Therefore, 
identifying, developing, and retaining such rare talent truly is a mission-critical 
global challenge for CEOs, senior executives, managers, and HR directors.

Talent Leadership: A Proven Method for Assessing and Developing High-
Potential Employees is written for leaders of HR, talent management, OD/MD 
professionals, and the vast population of operating managers who are charged 
with identifying, managing, and developing high-potential and emerging lead-
ers. Talent Leadership is a research- and empirically based book that uses my 
Stealth Fighter Model as the foundation for explaining the predictive relation-
ships that exist between an organization’s leadership assessment and develop-
ment practices and their achieving ultimate operating success.
As you read this book, you will learn about organizations that excel in:
1. Using assessments to benchmark current and future executive talent.
2. Leveraging accurate assessment data in the form of targeted devel-
opment through the use of coaching and other means.
3. Understanding the difference between performance and potential, 
accurately differentiating talent on both, and achieving significantly 
greater operating results as measured by EBITDA, net profit, and 
other critical operating metrics.
This book contains the best of what I have learned in my 30 years as a 
human capital and leadership consultant, executive coach, and industrial psy-
chologist. I have included a number of best practices, case study examples, au-
thoritative research, practical assessments, as well as a variety of practical tools 
and models to equip you, the reader, with the knowledge, skills, and passion 
to become superior HR leaders who are acknowledged and respected by their 
operating peers as critical drivers of operating excellence.
the essenCe Of tALent LeAdership
Organizations that excel in leadership assessment and development create a 
culture in which current and future leaders continuously develop:
 • Capability: The competencies and skills to execute—the can-do
 • Commitment: The passion, drive, and motivation to execute—the 
will-do
 • Alignment: The degree of “connectedness” a leader has to the strate-
gic mission and vision of the organization—the must-do
Great leaders, by virtue of their Capability, create, in turn, a culture for 
their employees and teams in which they become more Capable, Committed,

and Aligned. These three magical elements are called Leading Indicators: They 
predict operating results. Therefore, it is vital that organizations measure, cali-
brate, and recalibrate their current and future leaders on these Leading Indica-
tors and leverage this calibrated data and information using executive coaching 
and development. 
In reading this book, you will learn to:
 • Understand and articulate the numerous internal and external talent 
management challenges your organization encounters.
 • Understand and articulate the relationship between the relative 
strength of your leadership assessment and development practic-
es and your ability to successfully combat any internal or external 
challenge.
 • Understand and articulate the predictive relationships that exist 
between leadership assessment and development systems and prac-
tices; key leadership Leading Indicators; individual and team perfor-
mance; and ultimate operating metrics.
 • Establish a common language, vocabulary, and set of principles for 
establishing a powerful talent management mindset and culture in 
your own organization.
 • Understand and apply the skills and techniques that will enable each 
HR and operations leader to excel in the execution of superior leader-
ship assessment, coaching and development practices, and systems.
 • Understand and apply the skills that will enable each HR and opera-
tions leader to better calibrate leadership performance and potential.
 • Understand and apply the Psychodynamic Model of Executive Ma-
turity (the Enneagram) as an important foundation step for identi-
fying a leader’s predominant leadership style and level of executive 
maturity (the key to engaging in powerful coaching conversations).
 • Understand and apply the principles of assessment data integration—
connecting the dots and aggregating compelling assessment data.
 • Understand and apply the principle of coaching from the inside out, 
that is, coaching leaders to understand their inner core values, ref-
erences, self-concept, and essential “character” as a foundation for 
driving empowering thoughts, behavior, and winning results.
 • Develop and commit to a personal action plan designed to increase 
each HR and operations leader’s success as a Talent Leader.

This book originated from four sources: 
1. Experiences from traveling all over the globe for the last 30 years
2. Research I have conducted and continue to conduct on Trends in 
Talent Management & Executive Development
3. Consulting with over 250 organizations
4. Coaching over 200 executives
My speaking, consulting, and executive coaching work has put me in con-
tact with many types of organizations and people all over the world. I listened, 
observed, and gave assistance when and where needed. This book reflects the 
essence of what I learned about how organizations can strengthen their lead-
ership assessment and development practices and realize impressive operat-
ing results. As an industrial psychologist, I have long respected assessment 
and measurement. From a pure measurement standpoint, I have learned that 
strong predictive relationships exist between the strength of an organization’s 
leadership assessment and coaching practices and such operating metrics like 
EBITDA and net income. As an executive coach and consultant, I also have 
enormous respect for the qualitative aspects of helping leaders and organiza-
tions achieve breakthrough performance. I have learned that many organiza-
tions are neither prepared nor equipped to leverage calibrated assessment data 
to drive better development and succession decisions.
Unfortunately, the proliferation of coach training and certification programs 
out there often fail to meet either the organizations’ or the coaches’ expectations. 
Based on my experience, here are some of the reasons why this occurs: 
1. They don’t emphasize the proper use of a variety of diagnostic assess-
ments to calibrate performance, potential, and readiness.
2. They don’t provide sufficient depth regarding the proper interpreta-
tion of individual assessments.
3. They don’t emphasize the critical “art and science” of properly inte-
grating and interpreting perception and objective assessments.
4. They don’t teach the how-to’s of integrating assessment results into a 
simple, practical Individual Development Plan. 
5. Most importantly, they don’t teach how leaders and coaches can lit-
erally “unlock and unleash” executives’ potential by assessing and 
developing both their inner-core attributes and outer-core leader-
ship competencies (more on this in Chapters 4 and 11).

Given these reasons, my objective in writing this book is to help you be-
come a stronger HR representative in the boardroom, a stronger assessment 
guru, and a stronger executive coach. I want you to practice as a professional 
in this arena with a healthy respect for the predictive nature of what we do and 
the pure quantitative value we can bring to organizations. But also, I want you 
to practice with a healthy respect for the qualitative, “softer” nature of what we 
do and the value we can bring through personal touch, respect for others, and 
character. For the operational leaders who read this book, my objective is to 
equip you with sound ideas and practical tools that enable you to accurately 
identify and develop your current and emerging leaders. As a CEO or any oper-
ating leader, you can have no more noble or worthy a pursuit, given the opera-
tional and demographic challenges you encounter, than deploying the strategy 
of identifying and developing your current and emerging leaders as a means to 
mitigating your operating risk now and in the future.
