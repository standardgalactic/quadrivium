About the Author
“Life is full of ups and downs, good and bad, but it wouldn’t be fun
any other way.” Living by this optimistic philosophy, Gary McCord
persisted through years of mediocrity before finding success. An
outstanding player, television announcer, instructor, author,
speaker, and even movie actor, he has become a golf celebrity.
McCord is well known for enduring 23 years and 422 tournaments
on the PGA Tour without nabbing a single victory. A man of good
humor, he sported a “NO WINS” license plate for years to poke fun at
his less-than-glamorous work as a professional golfer.
“Trapped in the headlights of bankruptcy,” as he liked to put it, McCord pur-
sued other avenues in golf, and found himself launching a broadcasting career.
He scored big when a CBS Sports executive tossed him a headset and asked
him to do golf commentary — giving him only 15 minutes to prepare. A friend
of failure, McCord jumped in with no fear and impressed CBS with his perfor-
mance. Twenty years later, he is still providing color commentary for CBS golf
events. Fans and critics alike praise him for his knowledgeable perspective,
refreshing humor, and sometimes irreverent wit toward a game known for
taking itself too seriously.
Broadcasting changed his perspective on golf. Realizing that a better under-
standing of the golf swing would help his TV work, McCord studied under
Mac O’Grady, a legendary guru of the game. After two years of study he
emerged with knowledge, confidence, and an improved golf game.
Gary’s own golf really came together just as he began his career on the
Champions Tour after his 50th birthday. In 1999, his first full season on that
tour, he won two events — the Toshiba Senior Classic and the Ingersoll-Rand
Senior Tour Championship — to finish 17th on the official money list with
nearly $1,000,000 in prize money. Since then, he has continued to play well,
usually finishing in the top 30 on the money list while playing a limited sched-
ule of 10 to15 events per year.
When he isn’t broadcasting or playing golf, McCord keeps busy with myriad
other projects. He portrayed himself in and served as technical director for
the golf movie Tin Cup, starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo, and Don Johnson.
He is also a writer. In addition to writing Golf For Dummies, he is the author of
a collection of essays about his life on tour, Just a Range Ball in a Box of Titleists.
His bestselling Golf For Dummies was released in DVD form in 2004.

McCord and his friend and CBS Sports colleague David Feherty are known
to millions of golf fans and gamers as the voices of EA Sports’ Tiger Woods
PGA Tour video games. McCord also instructs and consults with more than
20 PGA Tour players. Along with another friend and fellow CBS commentator,
Peter Kostis, he co-founded the Kostis/McCord Learning Center at Grayhawk
Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Gary brings a sense of fun to everything he does and never takes himself too
seriously. He and his wife, Diane, share the “ups and downs” of a busy life
together at their homes in Scottsdale and Denver.

Dedication
I dedicate this book to my mom, Ruth, and to David Feherty’s make-believe
best friend, Flossy — his pet goat. They light up our lives.
Author’s Acknowledgments
It is a smart dummy who surrounds himself with good people. This book was
taken to the next level by Kevin Cook. Very good people. Here’s hoping we’ll
keep up with our readers’ ascent to the top of golf’s food chain. Grip it and
read it!
My wife, Diane, is simply the best. Her patience with my work and understand-
ing with my schedule I am unable to comprehend. She is my life’s caddie, and
a better one I could not have. To my mom, Ruth, my daughter, Krista, and
my four granddaughters, Breanne, Kayla, Jenae, and Terra: You will all get
still more free books. Thanks for thinking about me when I’ve been away
my whole life.

Foreword
P
ossibly the only saving grace for this publication is the fact that I’m writ-
ing the foreword, and I’m only doing it because the nimrod who wrote it
has threatened to publish pictures of Peter Kostis shaving my back in the
shower. Bearing in mind that this book was written by a man whose advice
helped me off the PGA Tour in both Europe and the United States and into a
TV booth, if I were you I wouldn’t set my hopes too high. To be honest, I’d trust
an Octoberfest-addled polka fiend with my beer before trusting McCord with
any kind of instructional manual, but this thing is a For Dummies book, so it
might just work.
To be serious for a nanosecond, I must say this book is the best guide for new
golfers that the world has ever known. I hope reading the following pages will
at least help you correct the most common error in golf, which is taking the
game — and more importantly yourself — too seriously. Just remember, you
are meant to suck at golf. Anyone who doesn’t is a freak of nature.
Yours with deep reluctance,
David Feherty

Introduction
W
elcome to Golf For Dummies, 3rd Edition. If this is the first golf book
you’ve ever read, don’t worry. I’ve read more of them than I can
count. Plus, I’ve had a chance to go back over everything I wrote in the first
two editions and make it even clearer and funnier.
My first thoughts about writing Golf For Dummies were no doubt similar to
your present feelings about golf. I knew that I wanted to do it, but I also knew
that it would take a lot of my time and attention. Did I want to devote most of
my spare time to an endeavor that was so hard? Why not? I haven’t given any-
thing back to society in a while!
Besides, the whole thing sounded like fun. So is golf.
About This Book
I want this book to appeal to players at every level. Although my buddies on
the PGA Tour will probably read it just to see if I can construct a sentence, I
like to think that I have something to offer even the best golfers. The guys I
grew up with at San Luis Rey golf course in Southern California will check out
Golf For Dummies to see whether I’ve used any of their funniest lines. And I
hope that the title will pique the interest of many people who have never
played the game.
In any case, you have in your hands a sometimes-funny, instruction-packed,
wide-eyed look at a game full of fascination that will serve you for the rest of
your days on the links.
This, then, is no ordinary golf-instruction book. Most of the volumes you can
find in your local bookstore are written by professional players or teachers.
As such, these books focus solely on the golf swing. Golf For Dummies covers
a lot more than the swing. This book ought to be the only book you need
before you develop a golf dependency. (Please contact a physician when you
feel the first symptoms coming on — frustration, talking to yourself after
missing a shot, that kind of thing. These are the warning signs. Remember:
From a medical standpoint, this book is cheaper than a visit to the doctor.)

Having said all that, I’m assuming that you have dabbled with golf, have
found that you like it, and would like to get better. In my experience, most
people give golf a try before they pick up the instructions. It must be an ego
thing, kind of like those people who don’t like to ask for directions when they
get lost because they feel that it’s an admission of failure. Most people want
to see what they can achieve on their own before they call in the cavalry.
Then if they still can’t find their way, they get frustrated.
My aim is to get you beyond whatever stage your golf game is at without your
having to resort to other texts. Golf For Dummies will build for you the solid
foundation needed to become not just someone who can hit a golf ball, but a
real golfer. There’s a big difference between the two, as you’ll soon discover.
Conventions Used in This Book
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in
any extra characters (like hyphens) to indicate the break. When using one of
these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, pretend-
ing that the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
The publishers and I have put this book together with your convenience in
mind. Nice, huh? What that means is simple:
 When you see the Technical Stuff icon (shown later in this Introduction),
you can skip that text if you want. It’s not essential to understanding the
rest of the book.
 The same goes for sidebars, which are scattered through the book,
printed on gray backgrounds. Sidebars are extra added attractions. I’ve
tried to make them fun and informative, but they aren’t crucial to the rest
of the book. Feel free to skip over them — you won’t hurt my feelings.
Foolish Assumptions
Because you picked up this book, I assume that you’re interested in golf. I
also assume that you’re not already a great golfer, or else you’d be out there
making millions on the PGA Tour. Beyond that, I’m going to figure that you’re
a little like I was when I became a professional golfer.
2
Golf For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

When I started out on the PGA Tour in 1974, I was full of fight and enthusiasm
but lacked a basic knowledge of golf-swing mechanics. A warm panic would
start to rise in me about ten minutes before I was due to tee off. Doubt and
dread would accompany me to the first tee. My brain would be racing, trying
to figure out what swing thought (that one aspect of the swing that you medi-
tate on to keep focused) to use that day. Most of the time, I’d be left with a
thought like, “Keep the left elbow toward magnetic north on the downswing.”
Usually, that action resulted in a silly-looking slice into a parking lot. I swung
the club that way for most of my career. So I know what it’s like to play with-
out knowledge or a solid foundation. Believe me, I’m a lot happier — and
having a lot more fun — now that I know what I’m doing.
The reason I’m qualified to help you now is that I have made a serious effort
to become a student of the game. When I started working on golf telecasts for
CBS, I didn’t know much about the inner workings of the swing. But my new
job forced me to learn. My odyssey led me to seek advice from some of the
world’s greatest teachers.
One of them was Mac O’Grady, a golfer I grew up with in Southern California.
He has developed a knowledge of the golf swing that, in my opinion, is
unequaled. O’Grady has researched his method with passion since 1983. The
result is a swing model that has been tested and never found wanting. I have
been lucky to study under O’Grady, and I can’t thank him enough. But I do
not cover Mac’s model in this book; his knowledge is for advanced golfers. No
one has ever called me advanced, so I’m gonna stick to basics in this book.
How This Book Is Organized
Golf For Dummies will lead you through the process of becoming a golfer.
Beginners need many questions answered as they take on the game. I’ve orga-
nized this book so that you take those steps one at a time and can return any-
time for a quick reference. May this walk be a pleasant one!
Part I: Getting Started: No, 
You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet
Where do I play, and what’s the course record? Wait a minute! First you need
to know what this game is about. You need clubs. You need to know how to
swing the clubs. You may want to take a lesson to see whether you like the
game, and then find golf clubs that fit you. In this part, I show you where to
shop for clubs and give you some tips on the questions to ask before you
make your purchase. Then I give you some ideas about what kind of golf
courses to play. Picking up golf is a never-ending process of discovery, and it
starts right here.

Introduction

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing 
If You Ain’t Got That Swing
This part gets right to the point. I give you a close look at the workings of the
golf swing and help with your mental preparation. You also get a good look at
the short game, where most scoring takes place. I show you how to blast
your way out of bunkers and make those 4-foot putts.
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes
In this part, I tackle the tough shots and help you deal with bad luck and bad
weather. You’ll develop many faults during your golfing life, and this part
addresses a majority of them. (You bought this book, so I won’t fault you for
that.)
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public
In this part, you get the final touches of your education as a golfer. You see
how the rules were established, how to conduct yourself on the golf course,
and the fine art of betting. You even get the do’s and don’ts of golf-course 
etiquette. After you read this part, you’ll be able to walk onto any golf course
and look like you know what you’re doing.
Part V: Golf: It’s Electric!
A sad fact of life is that you can’t always be out on the course. In this part, I
show you how to tap into the best of golf on television and online. Turn on
the TV to see tournaments to fantasize about and, of course, my smiling face.
Boot up your computer, and I’ll introduce you to a world of information, golf
forums, and more.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part contains the best of, the worst of — and some things that don’t
mean anything to anybody except me. I just thought you might enjoy knowing
about them.

Golf For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Part VII: Appendixes
Golfers have a language all their own. Appendix A lists all the terms you’ll
need to add to your vocabulary. Appendix B lists some of the more popular
golf organizations, products, and resources, along with a select list of schools
around the country.
Icons Used in This Book
I guide you through this maze of golf wit and wisdom with some handy road
signs. Look for these friendly icons; they point you toward valuable advice
and hazards to watch out for.
Duck! This is an awareness alert. Pay attention.
This icon marks golf hazards to avoid. Be careful!
This icon flags information that shows you easy ways to improve your game.
Do this or I will never speak to you again.
Talk like this, and golfers will understand you.
This might make your head spin; take two aspirin and get plenty of rest.
This icon flags information that’s important enough to repeat.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Go ahead, pick your spots. This book isn’t designed to be read like a novel
from cover to cover. If you’re a complete novice, read Appendix A first — get
comfortable with the language. If you’re a little more advanced and need help
with some specific aspect of your game or swing, you can find that informa-
tion in Chapters 6 through 10. The rest of the book will help you make that
vital jump from “golf novice” to “real golfer.”
As my former boss at CBS, Frank Chirkinian, said, “Golf is not a game; it’s a
way of life. If it was a game, someone would have figured it out by now.”
I hope this book helps you “figure it out.”

In this part . . .
T
his part explores the Zenlike qualities of golf: Why is
golf here? Who in the world would think of something
this hard to do for fun? This game must have been invented
by someone who guards the netherworld!
In this part of the book, I describe a typical golf course. I
also show you how to buy clubs and accessories that will
make you look like a pro. I show you how to learn this game.
I discuss where to take lessons and how best to survive
the lesson tee. In this part, you get a whirlwind tour, from
the driving range all the way up to a full 18-hole course —
including the penthouse of golf, the private country club.
Get ready; it’s time to play golf!

What Is This Thing Called Golf?
In This Chapter
 Knowing the goals of the game
 Answering the question: Why play golf?

 Becoming a “real” golfer
G
olf is a simple game. You’ve got clubs and a ball. You have to hit the ball
into a series of holes laid out in the middle of a large, grassy field. After
you reach the 18th hole, you may want to go to a bar and tell lies about your
on-course feats to anyone you didn’t play with that day. If you’re like most
people, you play golf for relaxation and a chance to see the great outdoors. If
you’re like Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, and Tiger Woods, you
make a bazillion dollars on top of seeing the great outdoors.
Of course, there are some obstacles. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, who
called golf “a silly game played with implements ill-suited for the purpose,”
the game isn’t always straightforward.
The Goals of the Game
Simply stated, the goal of golf is to get the ball into each of 18 holes in succes-
sion with the fewest number of shots, using no more 14 clubs. After you hit
the ball into all the holes, you add up your scores from all the holes. The
lower your total score, the better. That is golf. That is the goal.
The game lies in the journey. As you play, you devise ways to get the ball into
the hole in as few strokes as possible. Many outside stimuli — and many
more inside you — make this endeavor very interesting.
The best advice I can give you is to take the game slowly, make prudent deci-
sions, and never hit a shot while contemplating other matters. Golf should be
played with total concentration and a complete disregard for your ego. Try a
monastic existence, at least for the duration of the round. Golf tempts you to
try feats of derring-do. You must judge your talents and abilities. You alone

10
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 
determine your success or failure: Should you try to make it over the water
and go for the green that’s 240 yards away?
Figure 1-1 shows how to plan your course of action. You start at the tee and
move to Position A. If the ball goes 240 yards and a watery grave is lurking to
the left, don’t try the improbable and go for it. Lay up to Position B, and go
from there to the green via C. Take the talents that you have and explore this
ever-fascinating game of maneuvering a ball through the hazards of your
mind. Welcome to my nightmare.

ious —

Score is everything. As you see in Chapters 8, 9, and 10, most scoring occurs
within 100 yards of the hole. If you can save strokes here, your score will be
lower than that of the player whose sole purpose in life is to crush the ball as
far as possible. So practice your putting, sand play, and short shots twice as
much as your driving. Your hard work will pay off, and your friends will be
the ones dipping into their wallets.
Why Play Golf?
You’ve probably heard that business leaders are constantly making huge
deals on the course, advancing their careers. Well, “constantly” may be an
overstatement — business leaders, like other players, spend much of their
time on the course looking for wayward golf balls. But it’s true that golf may
help you climb the corporate ladder. That’s one reason to play.
And it’s about the 167th-most-important reason. More-important reasons
include spending time with friends, staying in shape, and enjoying some of
the most beautiful scenery you’ll ever see. (All tennis courts are pretty much
the same, but each golf course is different from every other, and many are
designed to show off their gorgeous settings.) Golf is a physical and mental
challenge — it tests your skill and your will.
It’s also a game for a lifetime. Your friends may play football and basketball in
high school, but how many are still returning kickoffs or grabbing rebounds
when they’re 30 or 40 or 60 years old?
11
Chapter 1: What Is This Thing Called Golf?
Why it’s the hardest game of all
As I see it, golf is the world’s hardest game for
two reasons:
 The ball doesn’t move on its own.
 You have, on average, about three minutes
between shots.
In other words, you don’t react to the ball as you
do in most sports. A baseball is thrown, hit, and
spit on. A football is passed, tossed, kicked, 
and run up and down the field. A basketball is
shot, rebounded, and dribbled all over the place. 
A golf ball just sits there and defies you not to
lose it.
In most sports, you have but an instant to react
to the action. Your natural athleticism takes
over, and you play to the whim of the ball. In golf,
you get to think about what you’re doing for
much too long. Thinking too much strangles the
soul and suffocates the mind.
Golf would be easier if the ball moved a little and
you were on skates.

The most important reason to play, though, is that golf is magic. It’s madden-
ing, frustrating, crazy — and totally addictive. When it becomes part of your
life, you can barely imagine life without it.
What You’ll Find on a Typical Course
Most golf courses have 18 holes, although a few, usually because of a lack of
money or land, have only 9. Courses beside the sea are called links, in honor
of the parts of Scotland where the game began. (They were the link between
beach and farmland.) The 19th hole is golfspeak for the clubhouse bar — the
place where you can reflect on your game over a refreshing beverage of your
choice. (See Appendix A for the lowdown on golf jargon.)
How long is a typical golf course? Most are between 5,500 and 7,000 yards. A
few monsters are longer, but leave those courses to the pros you see on TV.
Start at the low end of that scale and work your way up.
Every hole you play will be a par-3, a par-4, or a par-5. (Par-2s are for minigolf
courses; the exceedingly rare par-6s tend to be gimmicks.) Par is the number
of strokes a reasonably competent player should take to play a particular
hole. For example, on a par-5 hole, a regulation par might consist of a drive,
two more full swings, and two putts. Two putts is the standard on every
green.
Three putts isn’t good. One putt is a bonus. The bottom line is that in a per-
fect round of par golf, half the allocated strokes should be taken on the
greens. That premise makes putting important. (I talk about how to putt in
Chapter 8.)
Obviously, a par-5 is longer than a par-4 (two full swings, two putts), which in
turn is longer than a par-3 (one full swing, two putts). With rare exceptions,
par-3s are from 100 to 250 yards in length; par-4s are between 251 and 475
yards long, barring severe topography; and par-5s are anything longer than
that.
Many courses in the United States have a total par of 72, consisting of ten
par-4s (40), four par-3s (12), and four par-5s (20). But you can find golf
courses with total pars of anywhere from 62 to 74. Almost anything goes.
Table 1-1 lists the yardages that determine par on a hole, for men and women.
It’s worth noting that these guidelines don’t always refer to precise yardages,
but to what the United States Golf Association calls a hole’s “effective playing
length.” A 460-yard hole that went straight uphill, for example, could be a par-
5 for men.

That’s the big picture. You often find several different teeing areas on each
hole so that you can play the hole from different lengths. The vast majority of
holes have more than one teeing area — usually four. I’ve seen courses with
as many as six different tees on one hole. Deciding which tee area to use can
make you silly. So the tee areas are marked with color-coded tees that indi-
cate ability:
 The gold tees are invariably the back tees and are for blessed strikers
only.
 The blue tees are usually slightly ahead of the gold and make the holes
shorter, but still plenty hard. Club competitions are played from these
tees.
 The white tees are for everyday, casual play, and are the right choice for
beginning golfers. Stray from the white tees at your peril.
 The red tees are traditionally used by women, although many women I
play with use the same tees I play.
How You Can Become a “Real” Golfer
What’s a “real” golfer? There are three essentials:
 You understand the game.
 You can play it a little.
 You never dishonor its spirit.
Anyone can smack a ball aimlessly around a course. (I can already hear my
fellow professionals saying, “Yeah — like you, McCord!”) But that doesn’t
make you a real golfer. There’s much more to this game than hitting a ball
with a stick.
13
Chapter 1: What Is This Thing Called Golf?

How can you start becoming a “real” golfer? It’s easy: Read this book. You’ll
find everything you need to get started, from equipment to instruction to
common problems, etiquette, betting, and more. I tell you about the pitfalls
that beginners face (and I’m not just talking bunkers), and how to avoid
them.
You need to start by buying golf clubs and balls. You don’t have to shell out
thousands of dollars to get started. You can start simple — use cheap equip-
ment at first, and spend more if you enjoy the game. (Check out Chapter 2 for
tips on what you need to get started.)
After you have golf clubs, you need to know how to grip the club: The V
between the thumb and forefinger of your top hand should point to your
right shoulder. That seems simple, but you wouldn’t believe how many begin-
ners get it wrong — and complicate their voyage to the promised land of
“real” golfers. (Chapter 6 has more information on this gripping — pardon the
pun — topic.)
When you’ve got the grip down pat, you’re ready to swing. Believe me, the
swing is not as easy as it looks. That’s why I devote an entire chapter —
Chapter 7 — to developing your own swing. That’s where you can determine
what type of golfer you are. You can also find out about swing plane, various
checkpoints during the swing, and what amateurs can glean from the swings
of such great players as Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Annika Sorenstam, and
Tiger Woods.
You’ve probably heard about golf etiquette, handicaps, and one- and two-
stroke penalties — and maybe even such goofy-sounding things as nassaus,
skins, and barkies. If not, don’t worry. You’ll soon be tossing such terms
around like a pro. (Chapters 13, 14, and 15 give you the fine points of playing
with experienced golfers on public and private courses.) Knowing when to hit
(and when not to), how to keep score, and how to bet are integral parts of the
game.
Living the Golf Life
As any true golf nut will tell you, there’s more to the game than playing it.
There’s the fun of feeding your addiction by watching the sport on TV, follow-
ing it on the Internet, and playing golf video games when there’s a foot of
snow outside. (See Chapters 16, 17, and 18 for my guide to televised golf, the
game’s best Web sites, and other outlets.)
If the golf bug bites you, as it has bitten millions of others, that little sucker
will have you living and breathing birdies, bogeys, barkies, and digital dim-
ples — all the stuff that keeps golf nuts going when they’re not actually out
on the course, slapping balls who knows where.

Chapter 1: What Is This Thing Called Golf?
Cool historical things to know about golf
 The first reference to golf dates back to the
reign of King James II of Scotland. In 1457,
King James decreed that “futeball” and
“gowf” were forbidden so that Scottish 
men could concentrate on their archery
practice — the better to beat their enemies,
the English, on the battlefield. Golf remained
outlawed until 1501.
 Dutch historians including Steven von
Hengel have argued that golf originated in
Holland around 1297. A form of the game,
called spel metten kolve and also called
colf (which means club), was popular in the
late 13th century. Colf, it is believed, was
played mostly on ice.
 The first instruction book, written by
Thomas Kincaid, appeared in 1687. Among
his tips: “Maintain the same posture of the
body throughout (the swing) . . . and the ball
must be straight before your breast, a little
towards the left foot.” How did he know?
 In 1743, a shipment of 96 golf clubs and 432
golf balls made its way from Scotland to
Charleston, South Carolina. Such a big
order suggests it was intended for a group
of golfers. Another golf club or society may
have been organized in Savannah, Georgia,
in 1796, only to be disbanded later. It would
be another century before American golf
got going for good.
 America’s first permanent golf club was
formed in 1888 in Yonkers, New York. The St.
Andrews golf club played on a three-hole
layout that ended near a large apple tree.
The club’s golfers became known as the
Apple Tree Gang. They hung their coats on
the tree before they teed off. According to
legend, they finished play one day to find
their coats stolen by a rival gang known for
its disdain of fruit.
 In 1890, the term bogey was coined by Hugh
Rotherham — only back then it referred to
playing a hole in the perfect number of
strokes, or a ground score, which we today
call par. Shortly after the invention of the
Haskell ball, which made reaching a hole in
fewer strokes possible, bogey came to rep-
resent a score of one over par for a hole.
 The term birdie wasn’t coined until 1898,
emanating from Atlantic Country Club out of
the phrase “a bird of a hole.” This gap in ter-
minology is no doubt attributed to the diffi-
culty in attaining a bird, a fact that endures
to this day.
 A match-play exhibition was held in 1926,
pitting Professional Golfers Association
members from Britain and America. Played
in England, the home team dominated 131⁄2
to 11⁄2. The next year, at Worcester Country
Club, the teams met again, only this time
possession of a solid gold trophy was at
stake, donated by a wealthy British seed
merchant named Samuel A. Ryder. Thus
were born the Ryder Cup Matches.
 The Hershey Chocolate Company, in spon-
soring the 1933 Hershey Open, became the
first corporate title sponsor of a profes-
sional tournament. So blame the cocoa
guys.
 A local telecast of the 1947 U.S. Open in 
St. Louis marked the advent of televised
golf, a red-letter day in golf history if ever
there was one. Now I could finally have 
a job.

n the last 100 years, golf has changed enormously, but the most noticeable
difference is in equipment. The game may be inherently the same, but the
implements used to get from tee to green and into the hole are unrecogniz-
able compared to the rather primitive implements used by Young Tom Morris
(one of the great, early pioneers of golf) and his Scottish buddies in the late
19th century. Okay, so early golf equipment had more romantic names:
Niblick, brassie, spoon, driving-iron, mashie, and mashie-niblick are more fun
than 9-iron, 3-wood, 1-iron, 5-iron, and 7-iron. But golf equipment today is
much better.
The old Scottish worthies (a great name for players) used clubs whose shafts
were wooden — hickory, to be exact. Individually, these clubs may have been
fine, but what were the chances of finding a dozen or so identical pieces of
wood? Slim to none.
Nowadays, you have no excuse for playing with equipment ill suited to your
swing, body, and game. There’s too much information out there to help you.
And that’s the purpose of this chapter — to help you find your way through
what can be a confusing maze of statistics and terminology.
Golf Balls: The Dimple Derby
Many technological advances have occurred in the game of golf over the
years, but perhaps nothing has changed more than the golf ball. It’s no coinci-
dence that the United States Golf Association (USGA) and Royal and Ancient
Golf Club (R&A) keep a tight rein on just how far a ball can go nowadays. If

18
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 
the associations didn’t provide regulations, almost every golf course on the
planet would be reduced to a pitch and putt. We’d all be putting through
windmills just to keep the scores up in the 50s.
For the record, here are the specifications the USGA imposes on Titleist,
Maxfli, and the rest of the ball manufacturers:
 Size: A golf ball may not be smaller than 1.68 inches in diameter. The ball
can be as big as you want, however. Just don’t expect a bigger ball to go
farther — it won’t. I’ve never seen anyone use a ball bigger than 1.68
inches in diameter.
 Weight: The golf ball may not be heavier than 1.62 ounces.
 Velocity: The USGA has a machine for measuring how fast a ball comes
off the face of a club. That’s not easy, because impact lasts only 450 mil-
lionths of a second, and a good ball can zoom off at more than 170 miles
an hour.
No legal ball may exceed an initial velocity of 250 feet per second at a
temperature between 73 and 77 degrees. A tolerance of no more than 2
percent is allowed, which means an absolute max of 255 feet per second.
This rule ensures that golf balls don’t go too far. (In addition to balls, the
USGA now tests bouncy-faced drivers to keep a lid on distance.)
 Distance: Distance is the most important factor. For years the standard
was the USGA’s “Iron Byron” robot (named for sweet-swingin’ Byron
Nelson). No ball struck by Iron Byron could go farther than 280 yards. A
tolerance of 6 percent was allowed, making 296.8 yards the absolute far-
thest the ball could go. Today the robot has some help from high-tech
ball launchers in the USGA labs, and the upper limit has risen to 317
yards.
Yeah, right. Iron Byron, meet the PGA Tour! Guys like Tiger Woods, Ernie
Els, and their buddies just aren’t normal — they regularly blast drives
way past 350 yards!
 Shape: A golf ball must be round. An anti-slice ball on the market a few
years ago was weighted on one side and failed this test. Nice try, though!
Even with these regulations, take a look around any golf professional’s shop
and you’ll see many different brands. And upon closer inspection, you’ll find
that every type of ball falls into one of two categories: Either the manufac-
turer is claiming that this ball goes farther and straighter than any other ball
in the cosmos, or it’s telling you that this ball gives you more control.
Try not to get overwhelmed. Keep in mind that golf balls come in only three
basic types: one-piece, two-piece, and three-piece. You can forget one-piece
balls — they tend to be cheap and nasty and found only on driving ranges. So
that leaves two-piece and three-piece balls.

Don’t worry; deciding on a type of ball is still easy. You don’t even have to
know what a two-piece or three-piece ball contains or why it has that many
“pieces.” Leave all that to the scientists. And don’t worry too much about
launch angle or spin rate, either. Today’s balls are technological marvels,
designed to take off high and spin just enough to go as straight as possible.

Chapter 2: Gearing Up
When golf was a (lopsided) ball
Early golf was played with a feathery golf 
ball — a stitched leather ball stuffed with boiled
goose feathers. A feather ball cost three times
as much as a club, and because feathery balls
were delicate, players had to carry three to six
balls at a time. The balls flew poorly in wet
weather (a problem in Scotland), and were hard
to putt, because they weren’t round. They were
closer to egg shaped, in fact.
Although the feathery ball was a vast improve-
ment over the wooden balls that preceded it, the
gutta percha was an extraordinary break-
through. In 1848, the Reverend Adam Paterson
of St. Andrews introduced the gutta percha ball,
or gutty, which was made from the sap of the
gutta tree found in the tropics. When heated,
the rubberlike sap could easily be fashioned
into a golf ball. This invention, not to mention the
spread of the railways, contributed to the
expansion of golf. The gutty was considerably
more durable than the feathery and much more
affordable. After golfers discovered that bram-
ble patterns and other markings on the gutty
enhanced its aerodynamics, this ball swiftly
achieved dominance in the marketplace.
After 1900, the Haskell rubber-cored ball quickly
replaced the gutta percha as the ball of choice.
Invented two years earlier by Cleveland resi-
dent Coburn Haskell and manufactured by the
B. F. Goodrich Rubber Company of Akron, Ohio,
the Haskell ball, featuring a gutty cover and a
wound rubber core, traveled farther (up to 20
yards more on average) and delivered greater
durability.
It didn’t take much time for this new ball to gain
acceptance, 
especially 
after 
Alexander
“Sandy” Herd defeated renowned Harry Vardon
and James Braid in the 1902 British Open at
Hoylake, England, using the same Haskell ball
for 72 holes. Most golfers today, on the other
hand, use six to eight golf balls during a single
round of a tour event.
The rest of the 20th century was spent refining
the Haskell. In 1905, William Taylor invented the
first dimpled ball, improving flight because the
dimple pattern maximized lift and minimized
drag. Around the time Taylor was playing with
his dimples, Elazer Kempshall of the United
States and Frank Mingay of Scotland were inde-
pendently experimenting with liquid-core balls.
In 1920, gutta percha began to fade entirely from
use, replaced by a soft rubber called balata.
It was another 50 years before a popular alter-
native to the Haskell came along. In 1972,
Spalding introduced the first two-piece ball, the
Executive.
Today, two-, three-, and even four-piece balls
dominate the market. (A three-piece ball has a
thin extra layer between the cover and the core;
a four-piece ball has a core within a core.)
Many pros use three- or four-piece balls whose
cover hardness, launch angle, and spin rate are
perfectly tuned to their games.

Go with a two-piece ball. I wouldn’t recommend a three-piece ball to a begin-
ning golfer. Tour pros and expert players use such balls to maximize control.
For many years, the best players used balls with covers made of balata, a soft,
rubbery substance. Today, many high-performance three-piece balls have
covers of something even better — high-performance urethane elastomer,
which is a fancy way of saying “expensive superplastic.” But you don’t need
that stuff. As a beginner, you need a reliable, durable ball. Unless you have very
deep pockets and more cash than Bill Gates, go the surlyn, two-piece route.
(Surlyn is a type of plastic first developed by the Dupont Corporation.) Most
amateurs with double-digit handicaps use this type of ball. A surlyn-covered
ball’s harder cover and lower spin rate give you less feel — which is why better
players tend not to use them — but, assuming that you don’t whack them off
the premises, they last longer. They just might roll farther, too.
Golf balls used to come in three compressions: 80, 90, or 100. The 80-
compression ball was the softest, and the 100 the hardest. When I was grow-
ing up, I thought that the harder the ball (100 compression), the farther it
would go. Not the case. All balls go far when hit properly, but each one feels a
little different. How hard or soft you want the ball to feel has to do with your
personal preference. These days, you needn’t worry about compression. It’s
no longer such a big deal. Just determine whether you like a harder or softer
feel, and swing away.
Take all the commercial hype with a grain of salt. Make that a handful. The
most important things you need to know when buying golf balls are your own
game, your own tendencies, and your own needs. Your local PGA professional
can help you choose the golf ball best suited to you.
How to Choose Your Weapons
Deciding on a set of clubs to use can be as simple or as complicated as you
want to make it. You can go to any store that doesn’t have a golf pro, pick a
set of clubs off the shelf, and then take them to the tee. You can go to garage
sales. You can check with the pro at your local municipal course. Any or all of
these methods can work. But your chances of choosing a set with the correct
loft, lie, size of grip, and all the other stuff involved in club fitting are worse
than my chances of winning on American Idol.
Having said that, I must add that it wasn’t so long ago that unsophisticated
was a fair description of every golf-club buyer. Yeah, the better player might
waggle a new club a few times and “know” that it wasn’t for him — hardly the
most scientific approach!
If you’re just beginning to play golf, keep in mind that you may discover that this
game is not for you. So you should start out with rental clubs at a driving range.
Most driving ranges have rental clubs. Go out and hit balls with these clubs. If
you still want to play golf after hitting a few balls, then buy your own clubs.
20
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Find an interim set of clubs
If you’re just starting out (and you’ve played with rental clubs for a while),
find cheap clubs to use as an interim set during your adjustment period.
You’re learning the game, so you don’t want to make big decisions on what
type of clubs to buy yet. If you keep your ears open around the golf course or
driving range, you may hear of someone who has a set that he or she is will-
ing to sell. You can also ask whether the person has any information on clubs
that could be sold cheaply. Go take a look at garage sales that have golf clubs
for sale, or try the classified ads of your weekend newspaper. And, of course,
you can check the Internet — the fastest-growing marketplace in golf. (In
Chapter 17, I describe some of my favorite Internet golf sites.) You can
become your own private investigator and hunt down the best buy you can
find. Buy cheap for now — you’ve got plenty of time for the big purchase.
Try all sorts of clubs — ones with steel shafts, graphite shafts (which are
lighter and, therefore, easier to swing), big-headed clubs, investment-cast
clubs (made by pouring hot metal into a mold), forged clubs (made from a
single piece of metal), cavity-backed clubs (ones that are hollowed out in the
back of the iron). You have more choices than your neighborhood Baskin-
Robbins. Remember: You’re in your experimental stage.
Don’t be afraid to ask your friends if you can try their clubs on the range. I do
this all the time on the tour when a new product comes out. Try out these
clubs, and you can judge for yourself whether they feel good. But if you don’t
like the club that you just tried, don’t tell the person who loaned it to you
that the club stinks — that’s not good golf etiquette. Simply hand the club
back and say thanks.
Try this on for size
Today, club fitting is big business. Tour pros and average amateur golfers
have access to the same club fitting technology and information. It’s impor-
tant for all golfers — male and female — to use the right equipment for their
body types and physical conditions. For instance, many manufacturers of golf
clubs specialize in creating clubs for women that have softer shafts, which
are lighter and more flexible.
Here are some factors every golfer should consider:
 The grip: Determine how thick the grip on your clubs should be. Grips
that are too thin encourage too much hand action in your swing; grips
that are too thick restrict your hands too much. Generally, the proper-
sized grip should allow the middle and ring fingers on your left hand to
barely touch the pad of your thumb when you hold the club. If your fin-
gers don’t touch your thumb, the grip is too big; if your fingers dig into
the pad, the grip is too thin.
21
Chapter 2: Gearing Up

 The shaft: Consider your height, build, and strength when you choose a
club. If you’re really tall, you need longer (and probably stiffer) shafts.
What does your swing sound like? If your swing makes a loud swish
noise and the shaft is bending like a long cast from a fly-fishing rod at
the top of your swing, you need a very strong shaft. If your swing makes
no noise and you could hang laundry on your shaft at the top of your
swing, you need a regular shaft. Anybody in between needs a medium-
stiff to stiff shaft.
 Loft: Then there’s your typical ball flight. If you slice, for example, you can
get clubs with less loft — or perhaps offset heads — to help alleviate that
common problem. For more information about slicing, see Chapter 11.
 The clubhead: Consider the size of the clubhead. Today, you can get
standard, midsize, and oversize heads on your clubs. I recommend you
use bigger clubheads for your early days of playing golf. Bigger club-
heads are more forgiving and can help psychologically, too. With some
of today’s jumbo clubheads, your swing thought may well be, “With this
thing, how could I miss?”
 The iron: Advanced players choose irons that are perfectly suited to
their swings. Forged, muscle-backed irons are for good players who hit
the ball on the clubface precisely. Cavity-backed irons are for players
who hit the ball all over the clubface.
The bigger the clubface, the more room for error — hence the bigger-
headed metal woods that are popular today for all you wild swingers out
there.
Because of all the technology that is available, purchasing golf clubs nowa-
days is like buying a computer: Whatever you buy may be outdated in six
months. So be frugal and shop for your best buy. When you get a set that fits
you and you’re hitting the ball with consistency, stick with that set. Finding a
whole set of clubs that matches the temperament of your golf swing is hard.
Find the ones that have your fingerprints on them and stick with ’em.
22
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 
Ten questions to ask before you buy
 Do you have a club fitting program? Check
with your local PGA golf professional and
see whether he has a club fitting program.
If he doesn’t, he’ll be able to direct you to
someone in the area who does. After you’ve
started this game and found you like it
enough to continue playing, choosing the
right equipment is the biggest decision
you’ll have to make. So talk to a PGA golf
professional.
 What’s the price of club fitting? Don’t be too
shy to ask this question. Club fitting can be
expensive. You should be the judge of how
much you can afford.

Build your own clubs
You can get quite sophisticated when choosing a club. Club-component com-
panies specialize in selling clubs piece by piece. You can literally build your
own set of clubs to your own specifications; you just have to do some research
23
Chapter 2: Gearing Up
 What shaft length do I need for my clubs?
Golfers come in different heights and builds.
Some people are tall with short arms, and
some are short with long arms. People have
different postures when they bend over to
address the golf ball, and they need differ-
ent shaft lengths to match that posture. This
is where PGA golf professionals can really
help; they’re trained to answer questions
like these and can make club fitting very
easy.
 What lie-angle do I need on my clubs?
Here’s the general rule: The closer you
stand to the ball, the more upright your club
needs to be. As you get farther away from
the ball, the lie-angle of your clubs should
be flatter.
 What grip size do I need? The bigger your
hands are, the bigger grip you need. If you
have a tendency to slice the ball, you can
try smaller grips that help your hands work
faster. If you have a tendency to hook the
ball, you can use bigger grips that will slow
down your hands and help you beat that
hook.
 What material — leather, cord, all-rubber,
half-rubber — do you recommend for my
grips? Many different materials can make
up a golf grip. Leather is the most expensive
and the hardest to maintain. It’s for accom-
plished players; I don’t recommend leather
for beginners. Stick to an all-rubber grip —
and change your grips every year if you play
at least once a week. I use a combination of
rubber and cord — and it has nothing to do
with my name. These grips help me hold on
to the club in hot weather. My hands are
callused, though, so they don’t hurt from the
rubbing of the cord.
 What kind of irons should I buy — invest-
ment-cast, forged, oversized, or cavity-
back? The best advice I can give is to look
for an investment-cast, cavity-backed,
oversized golf club. For beginners, this is the
best choice. Just take my word for it — I
haven’t got enough paper to explain all the
reasons.
 Should I use space-age materials like
boron, titanium, or graphite in my shafts? Or
should I go with steel? Steel shafts are the
cheapest; all the others are quite a bit more
expensive, so keep your budget in mind.
See if you can test some of these other
shafts to see how they compare with steel,
which is still very good and used by most of
the players on tour.
 What type of putter should I use: center-
shafted or end-shafted? Do I want a mallet
putter, a belly putter, or a long putter?
There’s been an explosion of putter tech-
nology in the past few years. You can try out
the result at the golf course where you play.
Just ask the pro if you can test one of the
putters on the rack. If you have a friend or
playing partner who has a putter you think
you may like, ask to try it. For more on put-
ters and putting, see Chapter 8.
 If you’re going to buy new clubs, ask the
pro if you can test them for a day. Most of
the time, someone who’s trying to make a
sale will give you every opportunity to try
the clubs. Golf pros are just like car dealers;
they’ll let you test-drive before you buy.

first. A lot of people are building their own clubs, judging by the success of
firms like Golfsmith. For one thing, these clubs are cheaper than the clubs
you can buy off the shelf.
Although building your clubs does require time and effort, the end result is
the same. Component companies can sell you everything you need. You can
get catalogs, call their toll-free numbers, or visit their Web sites (see Appendix
B). Component companies offer grip tape, solvents, clamps, epoxy, shaft-
cutting tools, shaft extensions, grip knives, and every kind of shaft, head, and
grip imaginable. You name it, they’ve got it. You just have to know what you
want. If you’re not sure, order a club-making video or book first. You never
know — you may end up an expert in the field.
When You Know Your Game
Before 1938, the Rules of Golf allowed players to carry as many clubs as they
wanted. Since then, however, golfers have been restricted to a maximum of 14
clubs in their bags at any one time. But no rule tells you which 14 clubs to
use, so you have leeway. You can match the composition of your set to your
strengths and weaknesses.
I’m assuming that you’re going to carry a driver, a 3-wood, a putter, and irons
4 through 9. Nearly everyone does. So you have five clubs left to select. The
first thing you need to know, of course, is how far you’re likely to hit each
club. (That’s golfspeak for hitting the ball with the club. Don’t go smashing
your equipment!) After you know that, you can look into plugging the gaps.
Those gaps are most important at the short end of your set.
I recommend that you carry three wedges, each with a different loft. I do. I
use a 48-degree pitching wedge, a 54-degree sand wedge, and a 59-degree lob
wedge. I hit them 125 yards (pitching wedge), 105 yards (sand wedge), and 85
yards (lob wedge). That way, the yardage gap between them is not signifi-
cant. If I carried only the 125-yard wedge and the 85-yard wedge, that would
leave a gap of 40 yards — too much. If I leave myself with a shot of about 105
yards, right in the middle of my gap, I’ve got problems. Carrying the 105-yard
wedge plugs that gap. If I didn’t have it, I’d be forced to manufacture a shot
with a less-than-full swing. And that’s too hard, especially under pressure.
Full swings, please!
Okay, that’s 12 clubs taken care of. You have two left. I recommend carrying
at least one lofted wood. Make that two. Low-numbered irons are too unfor-
giving. So give yourself a break. Carry a 5-wood and even a 7-wood. These
clubs are designed to make it easy for you to get the ball up in the air. They
certainly achieve that more quickly than a 2-iron.
24
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Another option is the hybrid club. Sometimes called a utility club, the hybrid
is sort of an iron, and sort of a fairway wood. It’s a fairly recent entry — a for-
giving club that gets the ball airborne in a hurry. You can even use it for chip-
ping, as Todd Hamilton did on a shot that clinched the 2004 British Open.
Hybrid clubs, which come in different lofts, are getting more and more popu-
lar. You should swing a few, and consider carrying a hybrid instead of that 
7-wood, 5-wood, or maybe even your 4-iron.
Figure 2-1 shows the clubs that I have in my bag.
When to Use Each Club
Table 2-1 shows how far the average golfer generally hits with each club when
he makes solid contact. When you start to play this game, you probably won’t
attain these yardages. As you practice, you’ll get closer to these numbers.

You should know your average. The best way to find out is to hit, oh, 50 balls
with each club. Eliminate the longest five and the shortest five and then pace
off to the middle of the remaining group. That’s your average yardage. Use
your average yardage to help you gauge which club to use on each shot.

Tradition versus Technology: 
Keep Tinkering with Success
Technology is the guiding light of fundamental change that is inherent to a
capitalistic society in search of a more expensive way to hit the #$&*!?*@
ball farther.
—Quote on the bathroom wall of the Wayward Soul Driving Range

Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Technology and all its implications is a conversation topic that PGA Tour
players visit quite often. Is the ball too hot? Are the big-headed titanium dri-
vers giving the golf ball too much rebound? Is Tiger getting rich? I think that
most players would answer these questions in the affirmative. Should golfers
take a stance on the tenuous line between the balance of tradition and tech-
nology? “Probably not” would be the answer if all were polled.
To see where golf is today, you have to examine its past; then you can try to
predict golf’s future. This section helps you gaze into the crystal ball to focus
on what the future has to offer.
Whoever said that golf is played with weapons ill suited for their intended
purpose probably hadn’t played with clubs made of titanium and other com-
posite metals. These clubs allegedly act like a spring that segments of the
golfing populace believe propels the golf ball — also enhanced by state-of-
the-art materials and designs — distances it was not meant to travel. This
phenomenon is called the trampoline effect, which some folks may mistake
for a post-round activity for reducing stress. In fact, this effect is the product
of modern, thin-faced metal clubs.
This phenomenon has fueled a debate pitting the forces of technology (the
evil swine) against those of tradition (those languorous leeches who never
see special-effects movies). Equipment that makes the game easier for the
masses helps the game grow, the techno-wizards say. Traditionalists fret that
classic courses are becoming obsolete, the need for new super-long courses
may make the game cost more in both time and money, and golf may become
too easy for elite players. Regardless of which side you agree with (you may,
indeed, back both camps), one fact is undeniable: Improving golf equipment
has been an unceasing process throughout the game’s history.
People have been developing the golf ball and clubs for many years. In the
last 100 years, however, science has played an increasing role in golf-club
development, with a strong influence coming from research into new metals,
synthetic materials, and composites. Other developments worth noting:
 The introduction of the casting method of manufacturing clubheads in
1963.
 The introduction of graphite for use in shafts in 1973.
 The manufacture of metal woods in 1979 (first undertaken by
TaylorMade). This last creation rendered persimmon woods obsolete,
although a small number are still crafted.
The application of titanium to clubheads raised the bar in technological
development (yet again) just a few years ago. Lighter than previous materials
yet stronger than steel, titanium allows club makers to create larger club-
heads with bigger sweet spots that push the legal limit of 470 cubic centime-
ters. Such clubs provide high-handicap golfers a huge margin for error —
there’s nothing quite like the feel of a mishit ball traveling 200 yards! But it’s
27
Chapter 2: Gearing Up

golf balls flying in excess of 300 yards that raise suspicions that these new
clubs are making the ball too “excitable.”
Golf balls have been under scrutiny for much longer, probably because each
new generation of ball has had an ever greater impact on the game. Ball
development makes golf easier and more enjoyable for the average person
and, thus, cultivates more interest.
Modern balls tout varied dimple patterns, multiple layers, and other features
that attempt to impart a certain trajectory, spin, greater accuracy, and better
feel, as well as the ever-popular maximum distance allowed under the Rules
of Golf established by the USGA. A recent change in the Rules added more
than 20 yards to the old maximum of 296.8 yards. But even way back in 1998,
John Daly averaged 299.4 yards on his measured drives on the PGA Tour. By
2004 the leader, Hank Kuehne, averaged 314, and the trend is upward. Uh-oh.
In the coming years, golf stands to become increasingly popular, and if his-
tory tells us anything, it’s that technology is apt to contribute to the game’s
popularity. However, advances in golf equipment may occur at a relatively
glacial pace. The early 21st century likely won’t come close to rivaling the
first ten years of the 20th for technological impact or dramatic innovation.
Why? For one thing, scientists are running out of new stuff they can use to
make clubheads — at least stuff that isn’t edible. An expedition to Saturn may
yield possibilities. Metallurgists are going to be challenged, although so far
they’re staying ahead of the game. New entries in the substance category
include beta titanium, maraging steel, graphite (yes, in clubheads), and liquid
metal, all purportedly better than current club materials.
Dick Rugge, Senior Technical Director for the USGA, is one of the prominent
folks standing in the way of radical equipment enhancement. His job is to reg-
ulate the distance a golf ball should travel, yet he doesn’t want to stifle tech-
nology altogether. The goal is to give the average golfer an advantage
(whether it comes from the equipment itself or the joy of having better equip-
ment) while keeping the game a challenge for the top players.
But someone is always trying to build a better mousetrap. And although
everyone wants more distance, most performance-enhancing innovations are
likely to come in putter designs. On average, the USGA approves more than
one new putter every day, and many of the new ones look like something out
of Star Wars. Still, no one has yet invented a yip-proof blade. When somebody
does, that genius is going to make a fortune.
We may also see more changes in the ball — although, again, dramatic alter-
ations in ball design are unlikely. Customizing may become more common-
place. You may also see more layering of golf-ball materials to help
performance.
28
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Not to be discounted are improvements in turf technology — an overlooked
area boasting significant breakthroughs in the last 20 years. For example, in
1977, the average Stimpmeter reading for greens around the country (the
Stimpmeter measures the speed of a putting surface — or any surface on a
course) was 6.6. This means that a ball rolled from a set slope traveled 61⁄2
feet. Today, the average is closer to 9 feet. The biggest future breakthroughs
will probably come from humans. Physiological improvement and psycholog-
ical refinement may be the surest paths to more distance and lower scoring.
So hit the gym, take up Pilates, hit your psychologist’s couch, get in touch
with your inner self, eat bran and all the protein bars you can stand, drink 20
glasses of water a day, and take a stab at self-hypnotism if you have to. And if
all that fails to add 10 yards off the tee, then you can try a different ball. Ain’t
innovation grand?
29
Chapter 2: Gearing Up
Weapons of our fore! fathers
The earliest players carved their own clubs 
and balls from wood. Later, skilled craftsmen
assumed the task. Long-nosed wooden clubs
are the oldest-known designed clubs — and the
most enduring equipment ever conceived,
remaining in use from the 15th century until the
late 19th century. Long-noses were made from
pear, apple, beech, or holly trees and were used
to help achieve maximum distance with the
feathery golf ball, which dates all the way back
to 1618.
Later, other parts of the golf set developed: play
clubs, which included a range of spoons with
varying lofts; niblicks, a kin of the modern 9-iron
or wedge that was ideal for short shots; and a
putting cleek — a club that has undergone (and
is still undergoing) perhaps the most rigorous
experimentation. I know that my putters have
undergone severe tests of stamina and stress.
You’re probably familiar with the I’m-going-
to-throw-this-thing-into-orbit-and-let-Zeus-see-
if-he-can-putt-with-it test, as well as the 
ever-popular break-it-over-my-knee-so-it-can’t-
harm-anyone-again test. These tests should be
conducted only by professionals.
The development of the gutta percha ball, much
harder than a feathery, forced club makers to
become truly revolutionary. Some club makers
tried using leather, among other materials, in
their clubs in an attempt to increase compres-
sion and, therefore, distance (obviously, a
recurring theme throughout the ages). Others
implanted metal and bone fragments in the
clubface. In 1826, Scottish club makers began
using hickory imported from the United States
to manufacture shafts, and hickory was quickly
adopted as the wood of choice.
It’s probably a good thing that the fore! fathers
never saw what may have been the goofiest
innovation of all: the orange ball Jerry Pate used
to win the 1982 Players Championship.

Clothes: How to Dress Like a Pro
The easiest way to date an old picture of a golfer, at least approximately, is by
the clothes he or she is wearing. Sartorially, the game has changed enormously
since the Scots tottered ’round the old links wearing a jacket, shirt, and tie.
Back at St. Andrews, the restraint of the clothing affected the golf swing.
Those jackets were tight! In fact, I believe that was the single biggest influence
on the early golf swings. A golfer had to sway off the ball and then let his left
arm bend on the backswing to get full motion. Also, he had to let go with the
last three fingers of his left hand at the top of the swing. It was the only way a
golfer could get the shaft behind his head. Put on a tweed jacket that’s a little
too small and try to swing. You’ll see what the early golfers had to go through.
Fabrics have changed from those days of heavy wool and restricted swings.
Light cotton is what the splendidly smart golfer wears today — if he or she
hasn’t switched to one of the new, high-tech fabrics that wick perspiration
away from the body. (I always said golf was no sweat.) Styles have changed,
too. When I came on tour in the early 1970s, polyester was the fabric of
choice. Bell-bottoms and bright plaids filled golf courses with ghastly
ridicule. We’ve evolved to better fabrics — and a softer, more humane exis-
tence on the course. Some guys on tour now wear expensive pants with
more-expensive belts. And a few, like Jesper Parnevik, are known for the retro
look — plaids and pastels like we wore back in the ’70s! But most players
wear off-the-rack clothes provided by clothing manufacturers.
Women have undergone an enormous fashion transformation on the course,
too. Years ago, they played in full-length skirts, hats, and blouses buttoned
up to the neck. All very restricting, I imagine. Now, of course, they’re out
there in shorts and pants.
First of all, dress within your budget. This game can get expensive enough;
there’s no need to outdress your playing partners. My general rule is to aim
to dress better than the starter at the course. (The starter is the person in
charge of getting everyone off the first tee.) The starter’s style is usually a
reflection of the dress standards at that particular golf course. If you’re
unsure about the style at a particular course, give the pro shop a call to find
out the dress code.
The bottom line is to dress comfortably and look good. If you dress well, you
may appear as if you can actually play this game with a certain amount of dis-
tinction. People can be fooled. You never know!
Golf shoes are the final aspect of a golfer’s ensemble. Shoes can be a fashion
statement — alligator or ostrich. They can be comfortable — tennis shoes or
sandals with spikes. They can take on the lore of the Wild West in the form of
cowboy boots with spikes or, as my mentor Fairway Louie used to highlight
his golfing attire, they can even be military combat boots.
30
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

What’s on the bottom of the shoe is all the rage now. The traditional metal
spikes have been replaced with all sorts of soft spikes. Soft spikes reduce
spike marks and wear and tear on the greens. They’re also easier on the feet.
If the style of shoes is worthy, you can even go directly from the golf course
to the nearest restaurant without having to change shoes. The golf world is
becoming a simpler place to live.
Accessories: The Stuff You Need
When it comes to accessories, there’s a whole golfing subculture out there.
By accessories, I mean things like
 Covers for your irons
 Plastic tubes that you put in your bag to keep your shafts from clanging
together
 Tripod tees to use when the ground is hard
 Golf watches that keep your score
 Rubber suction cups that allow you to lift your ball from the hole with-
out bending down
I’ve even seen a plastic clip that fits to the side of your bag so that you can
“find” your putter quickly. You know the sort of things. Most accessories
appear to be good ideas, but then you often use them only once.
The place to find all this sort of stuff is in the classified advertising sections
of golf magazines. But take my advice: Don’t bother. Real golfers — and you
want to look and behave like one — don’t go in for that stuff. Accessories are
very uncool. The best golf bags are spartan affairs and contain only the bare
essentials:
 About six balls
 A few wooden tees
 A couple of gloves
 A rain suit
 A pitch-mark repair tool
 A few small coins (preferably foreign) for markers
 Two or three pencils
 A little bag (leather is cool) for your wallet, money clip, loose change,
car keys, rings, and so on
31
Chapter 2: Gearing Up

Your bag should also have a towel (a real, full-size one) hanging from the
strap. Use your towel to dry off and clean your clubheads. Keep a spare towel
in your bag. If it rains, you can’t have too many towels.
I mentioned headcovers. Keep them only on your woods or metal woods.
Golfers have a wide range to choose from. You have your cuddly animal devo-
tees. Other players like to be identified with a particular golf club, university,
or sports team. Some players are content merely to advertise the manufac-
turer of the club they’re using.
Bottom line? I recommend that you get headcovers with which you readily
identify. Create your own persona. For example, tour player Craig “The
Walrus” Stadler has walrus headcovers. Esteban Toledo, a former boxer, uses
little boxing gloves. Australian Steve Elkington doesn’t use headcovers.
As for your golf bag, you don’t need a large tour-sized monstrosity with your
name on the side. I’ve got one because I play professionally and someone
pays me to use their equipment. But you should go the understated route.
Especially if you’re going to be carrying your bag, go small and get the kind
with legs that fold down automatically to support the bag. First, you don’t
want to be loaded down on a hot day. And second, the last thing you want to
do is draw attention to yourself. Blend in. Be one with the environment.

 Finding information from other sources
S
uppose you just started to play golf by hitting some balls at the driving
range. Your friends took you over to the range at lunch, and you
launched a couple of balls into the sunshine and thought you might want to
learn the game. Where do you go?
 You can learn from friends. Most of us start out this way, which is why
we develop so many swing faults. Friends’ intentions are good, but their
teaching abilities may not be.
 You can learn by hitting balls. I learned to play the game this way. The
flight of the ball told me everything. I would go to the driving range and
hit balls day and night. The pure act of swinging a golf club in a certain
way made the ball fly in different trajectories and curves. This learn-
ing process is a very slow one because you have to learn through 
experimentation.
 You can learn from books. There are many books written on golf
instruction that can lead you through the fundamentals of the game. But
you can go only so far by teaching yourself from a book.
 You can take lessons from a PGA professional. This is the most expen-
sive and most efficient way to learn the game. Lessons can cost as little
as $8 an hour and as much as $300 or more. The expensive guys are the
ones you read about in Golf Digest and Golf Magazine and the ones you
watch on TV. All golf professionals can help you with the basics of the
game.

34
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 
Finding Out What You Need to Work On
Keeping a record of how you’ve played for a few weeks before taking a lesson
is a good idea. This information is invaluable for your pro. And don’t track
just your scores. Keep track of
 How many fairways you hit
 How many greens you hit
 How many putts you average
 How many strokes it usually takes you to get the ball into the hole from
a greenside bunker
Tracking all these things may seem like overkill, but doing so helps the pro
quickly detect tendencies or weaknesses in your game. Then the pro knows
where to look for your problems. If nothing else, tracking your play saves
time — time you’re paying for! Figure 3-1 shows how to keep track of all those
numbers on your score card.
Ten things a good instructor should have
 Lots of golf balls
 Patience
 A sense of humor
 Enthusiasm
 An ability to teach players at all levels
 An ability to explain the same thing in ten
different ways
 An encouraging manner
 A method that he or she believes in
 An ability to adapt that method to your
needs
 More golf balls

Chapter 3: Do I Need Lessons?

Where to Go for Lessons
Golf lessons are usually available wherever balls are hit and golf is played:
driving ranges, public courses, resorts, private clubs. The price usually
increases in that same order — driving-range pros usually charge the least.
As for quality, if the pro is PGA-qualified — look for the term PGA professional
posted in the pro shop or on his or her business card — you can be reason-
ably sure you’ll get top-notch instruction.
A qualified PGA teaching professional may charge between $25 and $50 per
session, which can range from 30 minutes to an hour. A professional has a
good sense of how much to tell you and at what rate of speed; not all lessons
require a specific amount of time.
When checking out places that offer golf lessons, ask whether they have
video-analysis capabilities. When you’re able to watch yourself on video, you
and your instructor can pinpoint problem areas for improvement. If nothing
else, a video record is a great way to track and monitor your progress as you
build your fundamental skills.
Golf schools
No matter where you live in the United States, a golf school should be fairly
close by. Golf schools are set up for all levels of players — and many of them
are aimed at those just learning the game. (Appendix B contains a list of rec-
ommended golf schools.)
Golf schools are great for beginners. You’ll find yourself in a group — any-
thing from 3 to 20 strong, which is perfect for you. There’s safety in numbers,
and it’s reassuring. You’ll find that you’re not the only beginner. And you
never know: Watching others struggle with their own problems may help you
with your game.
Most of the better golf schools advertise in golf magazines. Be warned,
though. These schools tend to be relatively expensive. They did very well in
the 1980s when the economy was perceived to be strong and people had
more disposable income. Since then, however, golf schools haven’t been so
successful. Golf-school lessons are big-ticket items, which makes them among
the first things people omit from their yearly budgets.
Having said that, many people are still going to golf schools. Why? Because
they work. You get, on average, three days of intensive coaching on all
aspects of the game from a good teacher. Because the groups are usually
small, you get lots of one-on-one attention, too. Then you have the experi-
ences of others. You can learn a lot by paying attention to what your fellow
students are being told.
36
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Don’t feel that you have to be hitting shots all the time. Take regular breaks —
especially if you’re not used to hitting a lot of balls — and use the time to
learn. Soak up all the information you can. Besides, regular breaks are the 
best way I know to avoid those blisters you see on the hands of golf-school
students!
Driving ranges
I used to work at a driving range in Riverside, California. I spent hours picking
up golf balls on the range and hitting those same balls when I was off work.
The range was bare dirt, the balls were old, and the floodlights had lost their
luminescence. But it was a great spot to learn the travails of the game.
Driving ranges have changed a lot since then. Many are very sophisticated,
with two or three tiers and putting greens, and some have miniature golf
courses attached to them. Some very good (and some not-so-good) instruc-
tors work at these facilities. Most of them can show you the basic mechanics
of the swing and get you off on the right foot.
Be sure to ask whether the pro at your local driving range is a PGA golf pro-
fessional. If so, you can be assured that he or she is fully qualified to guide
you through golf’s lesson book. If not, the person still may know a lot about
the game, but proceed with caution.
Local clubs
Even if you’re not a member, getting a lesson from the local club pro is usu-
ally possible. He or she will probably charge a little more than a driving-range
pro, but the facilities will likely be a lot better. Certainly, the golf balls will be.
And chances are, you’ll have access to a putting green and a practice bunker,
so you can get short-game help, too.
What’s a playing lesson?
A playing lesson is just what it sounds like. You hire a professional to play any
number of holes with you. This theme has three main variations, all of which
can help you become a better golfer:
 You can do all the playing. The professional walks with you, observing
your strategy, swing, and style, and makes suggestions as you go. I rec-
ommend this sort of lesson if you’re the type of person who likes one-on-
one direction.
37
Chapter 3: Do I Need Lessons?

 You can both play. That way, you get the chance to receive instruction
and the opportunity to observe an expert player in action. If you typi-
cally learn more by watching and copying what you see, this type of
lesson is effective. Pay particular attention to the rhythm of the pro’s
swing, the way he manages his game, and how you can incorporate both
into your own game.
 The pro can manufacture typical on-course situations for you to deal
with. For example, the pro may place your ball behind a tree, point out
your options, and then ask you to choose one and explain your choice.
Your answer and the subsequent advice from the pro help make you a
better player. Imagine that you have two escape routes — one easy, one
hard. All the easy one involves is a simple little chip shot back to the
fairway. Trouble is, because you won’t be gaining any distance, you may
feel like you wasted a shot. The difficult shot — through a narrow gap in
the branches — is tempting because the reward will be so much greater.
But failure will be disastrous. Hit the tree, and you could take nine or ten
shots on the hole. Decisions, decisions! Remember: There’s more to golf
than just hitting the ball.

Getting the Most from Your Lessons
Much has been written about the relationship between Nick Faldo and his
former teacher, David Leadbetter. Under Leadbetter’s guidance, Faldo 
turned himself from a pretty good player into a great player. In the process,
Leadbetter — quite rightly — received a lot of praise and attention. More
recently, Tiger Woods switched teachers and retooled his game. After Woods
won the 2005 Masters and British Open, his teacher Hank Haney got some of
the credit.
Ultimately, however, the teacher is only as good as the pupil. Faldo, with his
extraordinary dedication and total belief in what he was told, may have been
the best pupil in the history of golf. And Tiger is nothing less than the best —
and most focused — golfer of our time.
When you take lessons, you need to keep the faith. There’s no point in going
to someone you don’t believe in. If you find yourself doubting what you’re
being told, you’re wasting everybody’s time. Change instructors if that 
happens — that is, if your instructor doesn’t tell you to go elsewhere first.
Be honest
Okay, so you’re on the lesson tee with your pro. What’s the drill? The first
thing you need to be is completely honest. Tell your instructor your prob-
lems (your golf problems, that is), your goals, the shots you find difficult. Tell
him or her what style of learning — visual, auditory, or kinesthetic — you
find easiest. For example, do you like to be shown how to do something and
then copy it (which would make you a visual learner)? Do you prefer to have
that same something explained in detail (making you an auditory learner)? Or
do you prefer to repeat the motion until it feels natural (which would make
you a kinesthetic learner)?

Gratuitous solicitation: At the Kostis/McCord Learning Center at Grayhawk
Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, our sports psychologist, Dr. Don Greene, has
each student take a personality test of about 100 questions. He compiles the
information on a computer and then personalizes a lesson plan for each stu-
dent. Our instructors save valuable time because they know which teaching
technique is best for each golfer. By using this type of information, they
develop a much better teacher-student relationship.
No matter which technique you prefer, the instructor needs to know what it
is. How else can the instructor be effective in teaching you something new?
The bottom line is that the pro needs to know anything that helps create an
accurate picture of you and your game. Don’t be shy or embarrassed. Believe
me, there’s nothing you can say that your instructor hasn’t heard before!
Listen up
Now that you’ve done some talking, make sure that you let the pro recipro-
cate. Listen to what the pro has to say. After the pro has evaluated both you
and your swing, he or she will be able to give you feedback on where you
should go from there. Feedback is part of every good lesson. So keep listen-
ing. Take notes if you have to.
Don’t rate the success or failure of a session on how many balls you hit. You
can hit very few shots and have a very productive lesson. It depends on what
you need to work on. An instructor may have you repeat a certain swing in an
attempt to develop a swing thought, or feel. You’ll notice when the suggested
change is becoming more effective.
Don’t do what a lot of people do — don’t swing or hit while the pro is talking.
Imagine that you’re a smart chicken crossing the road: Stop, look, and listen!
Drop your doubts
Take it from me: Five minutes into every lesson, you’re going to have doubts.
The pro will change something in your swing, grip, or stance, and you’ll feel
weird. Well, think about this: You should feel weird. What you’ve been doing
wrong has become ingrained into your method so that it feels comfortable.
Change what’s wrong for the better and, of course, it’ll feel strange at first.
That’s normal.
Don’t panic. You’ll probably get worse before you get better. You’re changing
things to improve them, not just for the heck of it. So give what you’re told to
do a proper chance. Changes rarely work in five short minutes. Give them at
least a couple of weeks to take effect. More than two weeks is too long; go
back for another lesson.
40
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Ask questions
The pro is an expert, and you’re paying good money, so take advantage of the
pro’s knowledge while he or she belongs to you. Don’t be afraid of sounding
stupid. Again, your question won’t be anything the pro hasn’t heard a million
times before. Besides, what’s the point of spending good money on some-
thing you don’t understand?
The professional is trained to teach, so he or she will know any number of
ways to say the same thing. One of those ways will push your particular
button. But if you don’t tell the pro that you don’t get it, the pro won’t know.
Speak up!
Be cool
Finally, stay calm. Anxious people make lousy pupils. Look on the lesson as
the learning experience it is, and don’t get too wrapped up in where the balls
are going. Again, the pro will be aware of your nervousness. Ask him or her
for tips on swinging smoothly. Nervous golfers tend to swing too quickly, so
keep your swing smooth. Give yourself time during your swing to make the
changes. What’s important at this stage is that you make the proper moves in
the correct sequence. Get those moves right and understand the order, and
good shots are a given.

Chapter 3: Do I Need Lessons?
Ten rules to follow while learning
 Find a good teacher and stick with that
person.
 Follow a timetable. Discipline yourself to
work on what you’ve been told.
 Concentrate.
 Learn from your mistakes. You’ll make them,
so you may as well make them work for you.
 Relax. Take your time, and you’ll learn and
play better.
 Practice the shots you find most difficult.
 Have goals. Remember: Golf is a target
game.
 Stay positive. Golf is hard enough. A bad
attitude only hurts you.
 Stop practicing when you get tired. That’s
when sloppy habits begin.
 Evaluate yourself after each lesson: Are you
making progress?

Other Sources of Golf Info
There’s little doubt that the golf swing is the most analyzed move in all of
sports. As such, more has been written — and continues to be written —
about the golf swing than just about any other athletic move. Take a look in
any bookstore under “Golf,” and you’ll see what I mean. Maybe you have,
because you’re reading this book. (You made a great choice!)
Golf books that are almost 
as good as this one
So where should you go for written advice? Lots more books are out there,
and some are quite good. But most books, sad to say, are the same old stuff
regurgitated over and over. Remember: There hasn’t been any original
thought since the 15th century!
Here’s another secret: Stay away from many of the books “written” by the top
players. There’s nothing inherently wrong with the information they impart,
but if you think you’re going to get some stunning insight into how your
favorite plays, think again. In all likelihood, the author has had little to do
with the text. Exceptions exist, of course, but the input of the “name” player
is often minimal.
Monthly magazine fixes
The best instructional magazines are Golf Digest, Golf Magazine, and Golf
Tips. They’re published monthly and owe most of their popularity to their
expertise in the instructional field. Indeed, most people buy these magazines
because they think that the articles will help them play better. They all do a
good job of covering each aspect of the game every month. If you’re putting
badly, for example, every month you’ll find a new tip that you can try. Best of
all, these magazines use only the best players and teachers to author their
stories. So the information you receive is second to none.
But is the information in golf magazines the best? Sometimes. The key is to be
careful of what you read and subsequently take to the course. Top teacher Bob
Toski once said, “You cannot learn how to play golf from the pages of a maga-
zine.” And he’s right. Use these publications as backups to your lessons —
nothing more. Don’t try everything in every issue, or you’ll finish up hopelessly
confused. Be selective.
42
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Don’t get the idea that I don’t like these magazines. I’ve authored a few
instruction pieces for Golf Digest over the years myself. But, by definition,
these articles are general in nature. They aren’t aimed specifically at your
game. Of course, some of them may happen to work for you. But most won’t.
You have to be able to filter out those that don’t.
Videos and DVDs: Feel the rhythm
Instructional videos and DVDs seem to get more popular every day. Because
they can convey movement and rhythm so much better than their print coun-
terparts, they’re perfect for visual learners. Indeed, watching a video of a top
professional hitting balls before you leave for the course isn’t a bad idea. The
smoothness and timing in an expert’s swing has a way of rubbing off on you.

Gary’s favorite golf-instruction books
An amazing number of books have been written
on golf. Historians have tried to track every hook
and slice throughout golf’s existence. Many
have documented the footsteps of the great
players throughout their careers.
But instruction is the main vein of golf books
nowadays. There are books on every method of
golf instruction, from household tools used as
teaching aids to scientific data compiled by
aliens used on the planet Blothar. (Okay, so the
data compiled by aliens is a stretch.)
Anyhow, here are my favorite golf-instruction
books, listed alphabetically by author. I’ve tried
to help by reducing the list to my ten favorites,
but I know that there are many more that should
be included. The material is inexhaustible, so
take your time and peruse this golf library with
an open mind.

Both hands on the club, my body tense in anticipation of flush contact.
Eyes preoccupied with a distant stare of the uncertainty of the golf ball’s
destination. I realize that the swing sequence has begun, and I put all
available resources into sending the ball on a wanton mission of distance
collection. I sense the fluid nature of Fred Couples’s swing, the mass chaos of
Tiger Woods’s hips as they rotate through the hitting area, the silent stare of
John Daly’s gallery as they try to interpret what they just saw. I’m awakened
from my trance by the dull thud of contact: It hurts, it’s sickly, and I hear voices
from nearby, questioning my masculinity. Impact has all the compression of a
gnat flying into a wall of warm butter. My body is vibrating like a marked-
down, used Ford Escort, and I nearly pass out from the physical exertion.
Once I get back on my feet to review the moment and wait for the laughter
to die down, I realize that the instrument swinging this club has been totally
neglected and is in a state of sad disrepair. My “exercise regimen” up to this
point has been to get in a bathtub filled with lukewarm water, pull the drain
cord, and then fight the current. It’s time to end this madness. I’m going to
exercise!

M
y expertise in regard to exercise is minimal at best, and the area of
physical therapy is beyond my scope of knowledge. Therefore, I would
like to introduce you to a friend of mine: Paul Callaway, a licensed physical
therapist. I met Paul in 1984 when he was the first Director of Physical
Therapy we had for the PGA Tour. On the PGA Tour and senior tour, we have
large vans that accommodate physical conditioning apparatuses supervised
by physical therapists. This program was started for the betterment of physi-
cal conditioning on the tour. Paul is a guy I go to frequently when my senior-
tour body heads out of bounds.

Paul created Body Balance for Performance, a complete golf health and fitness-
training program. The Illinois Section of the PGA has endorsed his program 
and techniques. If you’d like more information about this subject, have other
questions related to golf health and fitness training, or are interested in locat-
ing anofficially licensed Body Balance for Performance center near you, call
ProDynamics, Inc. (a division of Callaway Physical Therapy, Ltd., in Oak Brook,
Illinois) at 888-348-4653, or refer to the Body Balance for Performance Web page

Why So Many New Golfers Give Up
Golf is a trendy thing to do. More than 26 million Americans are now screwing
up their lives by playing this game. There will be no sanity left for them after
they start playing golf. But then again, for bowling you have to rent shoes,
tennis is good if you’re 17 years old, and I still don’t understand squash, so
golf seems like the right thing to do if I’ve got the rest of my life in which to
do it.
This game is very hard, and if you take it too seriously, it frustrates you
enough that you’ll start wearing your shoes backward. Believe me, I know. . . .
Also, any lingering pain you have while playing discounts your ability to play
well and sends you to the snack bar to pick up an adult beverage more often
than you should. A lot of attrition is going on in golf, for two main reasons, as
I see it:
 Frustration from lack of improvement
 Injury
If you’re going to have fun playing this game, you have to get your body ready
to play golf for a lifetime. So let’s get physical.
The purpose of this chapter is to embarrass you into getting into shape so
that you can hit a little white ball around 150 acres of green grass without
falling down. How tough can that be? I identify five essential elements of golf
performance and elaborate on the physical requirements for performing at
your best while reducing your risk of getting hurt. The motivation here is to
get you out of the chair where you watch the Golf Channel and into a pro-
gram that helps you feel better, hit the ball farther, and run circles around
your kids in front of their friends. Well, the last one may be a stretch, but the
other ones are a go.
48
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Five Secrets to Success
Here’s a list of five things that you should utilize for good performance in 
anything you do (yes, anything!):
 A customized and sport-specific physical training program: Note:
Beer curls are not considered specific.
 Professional instruction in your chosen sport: I personally have an
après-ski instructor.
 Proper mental skills: Enough said.
 Training equipment: Please, no Speedos.
 Talent to enjoy the sport
All of these have to be blended into reaching your goal of playing your best.
When this process is learned and practiced, it is called integrated performance
enhancement, or “you da man,” as I call it.
If you’re going to play on the highest level, you have to have some balance
between talent, physical conditioning, mental awareness, instruction, and
good ol’ perseverance. Simply going out and buying new drivers that are
touted to hit the ball 50 yards farther is not going to cut it. Remember: You
have to have proper mental skills; use them in this case. Promise me.
Today’s golfers are getting into great physical shape. Gary Player was the first
guy on the tour who I saw preaching the benefits of being in good shape.
Even as he approached 70 years old, a milestone he reached in November
2005, he could do most things the kids on the regular tour can do, except per-
haps catching some big air on a snowboard.
Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh, and other top pros are into rigorous physical-
exercise programs that will keep them strong into the later stages of the year,
when a lot of players tire from so much wear and tear on the body. Both Tiger
and Vijay can hit the ball into the next zip code, and that’s not bad for incen-
tive either.
The Keys to Golf Fitness
Now that I’ve defined the elements of integrated performance enhancement
(you da man), take a look at three concepts that are crucial to a good training
program.
49
Chapter 4: Getting Fit for Golf

Structure governs function
This heading, simply put, translates to: Your physical structure affects the
way you play this game. If your range of motion is like the Tin Man’s, your
golf swing will not look very athletic and could actually rust. You need to
address problem areas with physical conditioning. It’s that simple, so get off
your wallet and do something, now!
Here are five areas you can address to help your golf game:
 Balance
 Control
 Flexibility
 Posture
 Strength
If you’re deficient in one of these areas, you may develop some bad habits in
your golf swing to compensate. Not only will your golf game suffer, but also
your body may break down from bad swing mechanics. Fix it now or fix it
later; it’s your choice.
Several things can cause structural imbalances. Typical factors include inher-
ited body characteristics and the natural aging process. Imbalance can occur
over a long period of time from consistent thumping of the golf ball.
Regardless of the causes of your body’s structural imbalances, the connective-
tissue system in your body, called the fascial system, can develop restrictions
that compress and/or pull on muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, bones,
everything. Left uncorrected, these imbalances in your fascial system will
leave you in a mangled mess and adversely affect your performance.
You’ll start to compensate for these restrictions in your golf swing, and pretty
soon your golf game will stink. So go see a health and performance expert
who is specifically trained to work with golfers, and cut out the middleman:
bad golf.
Physical training improves structure
How can you improve your structure to play better and safer golf? A quick
physiology lesson is at hand.
Earlier, I talk about fascia. More specifically, your body’s fascial system con-
tributes to your flexibility, mobility, posture, and function. Fascia, or connec-
tive tissue, is everywhere; it is the net that holds your body together.
50
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Fascia’s main job is to retain your body’s normal shape, providing resistance
to various stresses. In order to change your body structure and improve your
ability to play golf, you benefit most by following a specific sequence of phys-
ical training, called “Release, Reeducate, and Rebuild,” or, “The Story of Gary
McCord’s Career”:
 Release: First, you must release your connective-tissue restrictions.
Specially designed flexibility exercises help reduce tension in the inelas-
tic portion of the fascial system that resists lengthening. You must per-
form these stretching exercises at low intensity but for a prolonged
duration. Many people with significant fascial tightness need to sustain a
single flexibility exercise for a minimum of three to five minutes before
the layers of fascia begin to relax. A gentle, sustained stretching tech-
nique is far more effective than a short-duration, intense stretch because
it more effectively and permanently lengthens the tough connective
tissue of the body.
 Reeducate: As the fascial restrictions are being reduced, you need to
reeducate your structure by doing specialized exercises aimed at
improving posture, balance, stability, and control. These reeducation
exercises help you capitalize on your improved flexibility by teaching
you how to feel the positions in which your body is most functional. The
goal for each golfer is to develop a new postural identity that produces a
posture at address and swing mechanics that are safe, efficient, repro-
ducible, and highly effective.
 Rebuild: Last, you undergo a program of rebuilding exercises, or
strengthening exercises designed to solidify and then reinforce your
physical structure and dynamic swing motion. These exercises can also
improve your swing speed for added distance and improve muscular
endurance for better swing control and performance toward the end of a
round and/or during longer practice sessions.
This is a must for you prospective golfers: Enhance your structure and
improve your game!
Exercise programs must be golf-specific
and, ideally, customized
In order for an exercise program to be most helpful, it must be golf-specific.
Warming up by throwing a shot put is not going to help your golf game.
Fitness programs for other sports aren’t designed around the specific mus-
cles, movement patterns, and physical-performance factors that support the
golf swing.
51
Chapter 4: Getting Fit for Golf

Of equal importance to golf-specific training is customized fitness training. If
you start an exercise program that isn’t designed around your personal phys-
ical weaknesses, isn’t tailored to the special demands of golf, and isn’t
designed to accomplish your personal performance goals, then the chance
that the exercise program will help is nil.
Go out and find a specialist to work with and then ask what sort of initial
physical performance evaluation will be performed. The specialist will design
your program from his or her findings. The elements of the evaluation should
include at least the following:
 Health history of past medical problems, pain problems, injuries related
to golf, and so on
 Tests to identify postural, structural, or biomechanical imbalances that
may interfere with your ability to swing
 Balance assessment
 Muscle and joint flexibility testing
 Muscle strength, endurance, and control testing
 Biomechanical video analysis of the golf swing
 Golf skills evaluation (measurement of current swing and scoring perfor-
mance potential, including elements of the swing such as clubhead
speed and swing path, as well as driving distance, greens and fairways in
regulation, handicap, and so on)
 Goals assessment (evaluation of performance goals, purpose for playing
golf, and deadlines for reaching goals)
I’m proud of you. Following these steps helps you and your specific golf mus-
cles perform better, and it beats watching Judge Judy during the day. Your
physical abilities and conditioning will merge, and you’ll become a force to be
reckoned with out on the links. Enjoy your new outlook on golf!
Tests and Exercises
I’m going to give you the sample “laboratory white mice” tests before the ini-
tial performance tests you’ll be consulting a specialist for. From these tests,
you’ll be able to tell how much serious conditioning you need.
Please remember, if you are unable to perform any portion of these simple
tests or recommended corrective exercises easily and comfortably, you’re
not alone. I seized up during most of them! Go about it slowly, and if you can’t
perform one or the other, stop and turn on Judge Judy.
52
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Test 1: Club behind the spine
The club-behind-the-spine test is a very helpful evaluation tool because it can
identify several areas of physical weakness and/or imbalance. First, you know
that having adequate rotation flexibility in the spine is one of the most essen-
tial requirements to performing a good golf swing. The area of the spine from
which most rotation should come is the middle section known as the thoracic
spine. To have maximal flexibility to turn during the swing, you must also
have the physical potential to achieve a straighter thoracic spine at address,
which is the way you set up to the ball (see Figure 4-1). In contrast, a bent
thoracic spine at address blocks your ability to turn (see Figure 4-2).
Therefore, one important purpose of this test is to determine your ability to
achieve and maintain the ideal, straighter thoracic spine angle at address
through adequate chest and middle-spine flexibility.
Figure 4-1:
A straight
thoracic
spine gives
you
flexibility to
turn during
your swing.
53
Chapter 4: Getting Fit for Golf

In addition, this test measures (to a degree) the muscle strength of your lower
abdominals, hips, thighs, middle and upper back, and shoulder blades — all
essential to achieving and maintaining proper posture at address. Further-
more, this test can identify tightness in your hamstring muscles (the muscles 
in the backs of your legs).
Perform the club-behind-the-spine test as follows:
1. Stand upright while holding a golf club behind your back.
2. In one hand, hold the head of the club flat against your tailbone. In
your other hand, hold the grip of the club against the back of your
head. (See Figure 4-3.)
3. Bend your hips and knees slightly (10 to 15 degrees) and contract
your lower abdominal muscles, as needed, to press the small of your
back into the shaft of the club.
4. While keeping your lower back in complete contact with the clubshaft,
straighten the middle and upper portions of your spine and neck.
The goal is to make as much complete contact between the shaft and
the entire length of your spine and back of your head as possible. (See
Figure 4-4.)

5. Try to bend forward from your hips and proportionately from your
knees while maintaining club contact with your spine and head. Keep
bending forward until you’re able to comfortably see a spot on the
ground in front of you where the golf ball would normally be at
address. (See Figure 4-5.)
6. Remove the club from behind your back and grip it with both hands
in your normal address position while trying to maintain all the spine,
hip, and knee angles that you just created. (See Figure 4-6.)
If properly executed, the club-behind-the-spine test positions you so that you
feel comfortably balanced over the ball with muscle activity appropriately
felt in your lower abdominals, thighs, hips, upper back, and shoulder blades.
You achieve a straighter, more efficient thoracic-spine angle and a neutral,
more powerful pelvic position for the golf address position with proper
degrees of hip and knee bend. In other words, you achieve a posture at
address with the most potential for producing a safe, highly effective golf
swing.

If you’re unable to achieve the positions of this test easily and comfortably,
you may find the next three simple exercises helpful. Nevertheless, please
consult your physician before attempting to perform these or any of the other
exercises suggested in this chapter. Although these exercises are generally
safe for most individuals, if you notice any discomfort while performing them,
you should stop and consult your physician immediately before continuing.
Exercise 1: Recumbent chest-and-spine stretch
The recumbent chest-and-spine stretch can help golfers perform a vital func-
tion within the initial phase of any proper exercise progression, called the
releasing phase. This exercise specifically releases the tightness in your
chest, in the front of your shoulders, and in your lower back. After you’ve
mastered this exercise, you should have flexibility to perform the club-
behind-the-spine test and, therefore, much better posture at address.
Figure 4-6:
The ideal
address
position.
57
Chapter 4: Getting Fit for Golf

Perform this releasing exercise as follows:
1. Lie on a firm, flat surface with your hips and knees bent at a 90-
degree angle. Rest your lower legs on a chair, couch, or bed, as shown
in Figure 4-7.
Depending on the degree of tightness in your chest, spine, and shoul-
ders, you may need to begin this exercise on a softer surface (an exer-
cise mat, blankets on the floor, or your bed), and place a small pillow or
rolled-up towel under your head and neck to support them in a comfort-
able, neutral position. You may also need to place a small towel roll
under the small of your back to support its arch.
2. As shown in Figure 4-8, bend your elbows to approximately 90
degrees and position your arms 60 to 80 degrees away from the sides
of your body so that you begin to feel a comfortable stretch in the
front of your chest and shoulders.
This arm position looks a lot like a waiter’s arms do when he carries a
tray in each hand.
If you feel any pinching pain in your shoulders, try elevating your arms
and resting them on a stack of towels or a small pillow so that your
elbows are higher above the floor than your shoulders.
Figure 4-7:
The
beginning
position 
for the
recumbent
chest-and-
spine
stretch.
58
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

3. Relax into this comfortable stretch position for at least three to five
minutes or until you experience a complete release of the tightness in
your chest, front of your shoulders, and lower back.
You’re trying to get your back, spine, and shoulders completely flat on
the floor.
Repeat this exercise daily for five to ten days until you can perform the exer-
cise easily, feeling no lingering tightness in your body.
You may want to increase the degree of stretch in your body by removing any
support or padding from under your body and/or arms — or even by adding
a small towel roll under the middle portion of your spine (at shoulder-blade
level) in a position perpendicular to your spine (see Figure 4-9). Remember
always to keep the degree of stretch comfortable and to support your head,
neck, spine, and arms so that you don’t put excessive stress on those struc-
tures while you perform this exercise.

Chapter 4: Getting Fit for Golf

Exercise 2: Recumbent abdominal-and-shoulder-blade squeeze
The recumbent abdominal-and-shoulder-blade squeeze is designed to help
reeducate your golf posture and begin rebuilding two key areas of muscle
strength necessary for great posture at address: your lower abdominals and
your shoulder-blade muscles.
Perform this reeducation and rebuilding exercise as follows:
1. Assume the same starting position as for the recumbent chest and
spine stretch (refer to Figure 4-8).
2. Contract the muscles of your lower abdominals and middle and lower
shoulder-blade regions so that you can feel the entire length of your
spine, neck, and shoulders flattening firmly to the floor.
If you’re performing this exercise properly, you should feel a comfort-
able degree of muscle contraction while you maintain a normal, relaxed
breathing pattern (see Figure 4-10).
3. Hold this contraction for three to five breaths, relax, and then repeat
the exercise.
Perform this exercise at least once every other day for 2 to 3 weeks, starting
with one set of 10 repetitions and building up gradually to one set of 50 repe-
titions as needed.

Make sure

Exercise 3: Prone torso lift
To advance the recumbent abdominal-and-shoulder-blade squeeze exercise,
you can further challenge your abdominal, spine, and shoulder-blade muscles
by trying the prone torso lift. This exercise provides the same golf-specific
benefits as the preceding exercise but to a more advanced degree.
Perform this exercise as follows:
1. Turn over on your stomach, place several large pillows under your
body, and place your arms in the double “tray position” with your
forehead resting on a towel roll, as shown in Figure 4-11.
2. Perform a pelvic tilt by squeezing your lower abdominal muscles, and
rotate your pelvis forward.
3. Place your arms in the double “tray position,” keeping your neck long
and your chin tucked, and lift just your upper torso comfortably off
the pillows until you have achieved a straight spine (see Figure 4-12).
Be sure to keep your neck tucked in and your lower back flat by con-
tracting your lower abdominal muscles. Also remember to breathe com-
fortably throughout the exercise. If you perform it properly, you should
be able to achieve a lift position such that someone could place a golf
club flat along your spine and have virtually no space between your
spine and the clubshaft.
4. Hold the lift for three to five breaths, and then slowly relax and
repeat.
Do this exercise at least every other day for 1 to 2 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions,
and for about 2 to 3 weeks or until the exercise becomes very easy.

Test 2: Standing balance sway
After posture, the next most important physical characteristic required to
make an optimal and consistent golf swing is balance. The purpose of the
standing balance-sway test is to help you identify muscle and connective
tissue tightness that may be pulling you out of ideal standing posture and bal-
ance, thus interfering with your posture and balance at address and during
your full swing.
Perform the standing balance-sway test as follows:
1. Remove your shoes and stand on a level surface with your arms hang-
ing relaxed by your sides.
If you’ve been prescribed customized orthotics (arch supports) for your
shoes, repeat this test with your orthotics in place and your shoes on.
2. Close your eyes and gently relax your body so that you can attempt to
feel which direction your body would tend to drift, tip, or sway if you
let it.
3. After 5 to 10 seconds, open your eyes and identify the predominant
direction of sway.
4. Repeat the test several times to determine whether you have a consis-
tent direction of sway.
Much like a tent’s center pole leaning toward a support wire that has been
staked into the ground too tightly, the direction that you consistently feel is
the first and/or strongest direction of sway is probably caused by connective
tissue and muscle tightness pulling your body in that direction. If left uncor-
rected, this tightness will also pull you out of posture and balance at address
as well as during your swing. Any attempts to correct your swing motion
without first reducing the physical causes of your posture and balance dys-
function can lead to inconsistent performance and/or injury.

Exercise 4: Single-leg balance drill
Many exercises can improve your standing balance as a golfer. One simple
balance reeducation exercise is called the single-leg balance drill.
Perform this balance reeducation exercise as follows:
1. Stand on a firm, flat surface in your bare or stocking feet.
If you have been prescribed customized orthotics (arch supports) for
your shoes, repeat this exercise with your orthotics in place and your
shoes on.
2. Place a club behind your spine as though you were trying to perform
the club-behind-the-spine test (refer to Figure 4-4).
3. With your eyes open, try to stand and balance on your right leg by lift-
ing your left knee to approximately 90 degrees so that your left thigh
is parallel to the floor (see Figure 4-13). In this position, do your best
to maintain your balance for 10 to 15 seconds.
4. Repeat the exercise with your left leg down, lifting your right knee to
90 degrees.
Figure 4-13:
Try to
balance in
this position
for 10 to 15
seconds.
63
Chapter 4: Getting Fit for Golf

Do this exercise 10 to 20 times with each leg at least once each day for 2 to 
3 weeks or until you can easily perform the exercise without losing your bal-
ance on one foot for 15 seconds.
To increase the difficulty of this exercise and improve your golf balance even
more, try the exercise with your eyes closed! You can imagine how much
more balanced you’ll feel over the ball at address and during your full swing
when you can master this exercise with your eyes open and then with your
eyes closed.
Test 3: Seated trunk rotation
Rotation flexibility in the spine and hips is essential for optimal and safe golf.
Without it, you can’t make a complete, well-balanced backswing and follow-
through. Furthermore, compensations that you’ll most certainly make as a
result will force biomechanical swing flaws such as reverse pivots, lateral
sways, and coming over the top. Compensations from a lack of spine and hip-
rotation flexibility can also create stress in other body areas that aren’t
designed to rotate. If left uncorrected, this physical limitation will eventually
spell disaster by causing an injury.
The next two tests can help you evaluate your rotation flexibility in the spine
and hips.
The first test is called the seated trunk-rotation test. Perform this test as 
follows:
1. Sit forward in a chair so that your spine is not resting against the back
of the chair.
2. Place a golf club across the front of your chest and shoulders (at the
collarbone level) and hold the club securely by crossing both hands
in front of you (see Figure 4-14).
3. Sit as tall as possible in the chair, with your feet flat on the floor, both
knees pointing straight ahead, and turn your upper torso as far as
comfortably possible to the right (see Figure 4-15).
4. When you’ve turned completely, look over your right shoulder and
see where the end of the club is pointing behind you. Mentally mark
the spot on the wall and estimate the number of degrees of rotation
that you’ve turned to the right.
5. Slowly return to the neutral starting position and then repeat the
trunk-rotation test to the left.
Repeat this test in both directions three to five times to get a good estimate
of the amount of trunk rotation in each direction and which direction you can
rotate farther and/or easier.

Exercise 5: Supine trunk-rotation stretch
The supine trunk rotation stretch is a good releasing exercise to help
improve your ability to complete a stress-free backswing and follow-through.
If the seated trunk-rotation test (Test #3) identified limitations in one or both
directions, this exercise can help you gain flexibility in the proper region of
your spine and enable a better turn.
Perform this releasing exercise as follows:
1. Lie on your back with your hips and knees bent so that your feet are
flat on the floor and your arms rest comfortably away from your sides
in the double “tray position” (see Figure 4-16).
2. Gently squeeze your shoulder blades and flatten your neck to the
floor while you slowly and gently rotate your legs to the left.
3. Continue to slowly twist your body, keeping your right shoulder blade
and forearm flat to the floor until you begin to feel a comfortable
stretch in your spine and possibly in your right hip and the front of
your right shoulder (see Figure 4-17).
4. Hold this position for three to five minutes or until you feel a com-
plete release of the gentle stretch in your body.
You can enhance the stretch in this position by bringing your left hand
down from the “tray position” and gently pressing down on your right
thigh, as shown in Figure 4-17.
5. Slowly return to the neutral starting position and then repeat the
stretch, this time rotating your legs to the right.

back with
your knees

position.”
66
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Practice this releasing exercise at least once a day for two to three weeks
until you can stretch equally well in both directions. If your spine was more
stiff or limited in rotation when turning to your right during the seated trunk-
rotation test, you should spend more time initially rotating your legs to the
left. Likewise, if your trunk-rotation flexibility was more limited when turning
to your left, then initially rotate your legs to the right in this exercise. Your
ultimate goal is balanced rotation in both directions.
Test 4: Seated hip rotation
The seated hip-rotation test is designed to measure the relative degree of
rotation flexibility in your hips. This test can identify whether you have signif-
icant tightness in one or both hips that may be interfering with your ability to
rotate your hips during your golf swing. Poor hip rotation is one of the major
causes of low back pain for golfers and can cause poor full-swing perfor-
mance and inconsistency.
Perform the seated hip-rotation test as follows:
1. Sit forward in a chair so that your spine is not resting against the back
of the chair.
2. Sit as tall as possible with your spine straight. Cross your right leg
over your left knee so that the outer part of your right ankle rests on
the top of your left knee (see Figure 4-18).
3. Without losing your sitting posture, take both hands and gently apply
downward pressure to the top of your right knee until you cannot
comfortably push your shin any closer to a position parallel to the
floor (see Figure 4-19).

4. When you’ve reached the limit of stretch for your right hip, observe
your relative difficulty in achieving this position, the specific location
and degree of tightness in your body, and the relative angle of your
right shin in relation to the floor.
5. Slowly release your right knee and repeat the test with your left ankle
resting on your right knee.
6. Compare the results of testing both hips and determine whether one
or both hips have rotation-flexibility limitations.
Exercise 6: Supine hip-rotation stretch
The supine hip-rotation stretch is a safe and effective exercise to help you
reduce hip-rotation tightness and, therefore, improve your ability to make a
full turn around your hips during a full golf swing.
Perform this releasing exercise as follows:
1. Lie on your back close to a wall. Place both feet on the wall so that
your hips and knees are bent about 90 degrees. (See Figure 4-20.)
2. Cross your right foot over your left knee and rest both hands on your
right knee.
Figure 4-20:
Put your
feet against
a wall with
your knees

angle.
69
Chapter 4: Getting Fit for Golf

3. Gently apply pressure to your right knee with your hands in a direc-
tion down and away from your right shoulder (see Figure 4-21) until
you feel a light, comfortable stretch in the outer portion of your right
hip and/or groin.
4. Hold this stretch for three to five minutes or until you feel a complete
release of the original stretch in your right hip.
5. After the stretch is complete, slowly release the pressure on your
right knee and repeat the stretch on your left hip.
Practice this releasing exercise at least once a day for two to three weeks or
until you can stretch equally well in both hips. If you found one hip to be
tighter than the other during the seated hip-rotation stretch, then initially
spend more time stretching the tighter hip. Your ultimate goal is balanced
rotation for both hips. Only by achieving complete and balanced hip-rotation
flexibility can you accomplish a full backswing and follow-through with each
and every swing.
After you’re balanced, you can advance this stretch simply by moving your
body closer to the wall at the start. This allows your hips and knees to bend
at an angle greater than 90 degrees, for a greater degree of stretch in your
hips.

Who to Play With
In This Chapter
 Practicing at driving ranges
 Reserving tee times on public courses
 Fitting in at country clubs and golf resorts
 Blending into a golf foursome
 Surviving a round with a jerk
G
olf is played in three places: at public facilities, at private clubs, and on 
resort courses. In this chapter, I tell you the basics about all three, from
the scuzziest range to the fanciest country club. I also share tips on how to fit
in wherever you play — how to walk, talk, tip, practice and accessorize like a
real golfer. I even tell you how to make the best of a round with a jerk. There
aren’t many jerks in golf, but you’ve gotta be ready for anything.
Let’s start with the basics: Where in the world can you play this game?
Some courses have only 9 holes, while a few resorts offer half a dozen 18-hole
courses, or even more. At the famous Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina,
you’ll find eight great 18-hole layouts — that’s 144 chances to drive yourself
nuts!
You can also hit balls at driving ranges, which is where you should start. If
you rush to the nearest course for your first try at golf, tee off, and then
spend most of the next few hours missing the ball, you won’t be very popular
with your fellow golfers. Believe me, instead of watching you move large
clumps of earth with every swing, they’d prefer to enjoy a cool beverage in
the clubhouse.

72
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 
Driving Ranges
Driving ranges are fun. You can make all the mistakes you want. You can miss
the ball, slice it, duff it, top it — do anything. The only people who’ll know are
the ones next to you, and they’re probably making the same mistakes.
Driving ranges are basically large fields, stretching as far as 500 yards in
length — which means, of course, that even long hitters like Tiger Woods and
John Daly can “let the shaft out” and swing for the fences. But you don’t have
to hit your driver. Any good driving range will have signs marking off 50
yards, 100 yards, 150 yards, and so on. You can practice hitting to these tar-
gets with any club.
Some driving ranges will lend or rent you clubs, but most expect you to bring
your own. As for balls, you purchase bucketsful for a few dollars — how
many dollars depends on where you are. In some parts of the United States,
you can still hit a nice big bucket of balls for a dollar. But on weekends at
Chelsea Piers Golf Club in New York City, it’s a lot more: up to 20 times as
much. (At least you get a great view of New Jersey. . . .)
Public Courses
As you’d expect from their name, public courses are open to anyone who can
afford the greens fee. They tend to be busy, especially on weekends and holi-
days. At premier public courses like Bethpage Black, the site of the 2002 U.S.
Open, some golfers sleep in their cars overnight so they’ll be first in line for a
tee time the next morning. Sleeping in a car may not sound like much fun, but
I’m told it’s a great bonding experience.
Tee-time policies
Each course has its own tee-time policy. Many let you book a time up to a
week in advance. Others follow a strange rule: You must show up at a desig-
nated time midweek to sign up for weekend play. And some courses you can’t
book at all. You just show up and take your chance (hence, the overnight
gang sleeping in their cars). My advice is simple: Phone ahead and find out
the policy at the course you want to play.
Okay, I’ll assume that you’ve jumped through whatever hoops are necessary
and you know when you’re supposed to play. So you pull into the parking lot
about an hour before your tee time. What next? Most courses have a club-
house. You may want to stop inside to change clothes, and maybe buy some-
thing to eat or drink.

By all means, make use of the clubhouse, but don’t change your shoes in
there. If you’re already dressed to hit the greens, put on your golf shoes in
the parking lot. Then throw your street shoes into the trunk. Don’t worry
about looking goofy as you lace those spikes with your foot on the car
bumper. Everyone does it!
I’m here! Now what?
The first thing to do at the clubhouse is to confirm your time with the pro or
starter, and then pay for your round. The pro is sure to be in one of two
places: teaching on the practice range or hanging out in the pro shop. If the
pro doesn’t take the money, the starter adjacent to the first tee usually will.
As for cost, the price depends on the course and its location. You can pay
anything from $10 to more than $150. At gorgeous Pebble Beach Golf Links in
California, the greens fee is more than $400!
After the financial formalities are out of the way, hit some balls on the driving
range to warm up those creaky joints of yours.
Your practice sessions may not be as long as mine, but then you’re not trying
to figure out how to beat Hale Irwin on the Champions Tour!
Here’s what I do when I’m playing in a pro event: I get to the course one hour
before my starting time. I go to the putting green and practice short shots —
chip shots and short pitches. (Chapter 9 covers these shots in detail.) This
gives me an idea how fast the greens are and slowly loosens me up for full-
swing shots.
Make sure that you’re allowed to pitch to the practice green on your course —
some courses prohibit it.
Then I wander over to the practice tee and loosen up with some of the exer-
cises that I describe in Part II. Start with the wedges and work your way up to
the driver.
Next, I hit my 3-wood (some players call this titanium club the 3-metal — a
more accurate term, but it clangs in my ears). Then I proceed to bomb the
driver. (If John Daly is next to me, I quietly wait for him to finish, and then I hit
my driver.) Immediately after hitting practice drives — ten balls at most — I
hit some short sand-wedge shots to slow down my metabolism.
I visit the putting green next, usually 15 minutes before I tee off. (See Chapter 8
for more about putting.) I start with simple 2- to 3-foot putts straight up a hill,
to build my confidence. Then I proceed to very long putts — aiming not for
the hole, but for the far fringe of the green. I do this because I don’t want to
become target-conscious on long putts. Putting the ball to the fringe lets me
work on speed. It’s the last thing I do before going to the tee. (Well, if it’s a big
tournament and my knees are shaking, I’ll make a detour to the restroom.)
73
Chapter 5: Where to Play and Who to Play With

Country Clubs
In your early days as a golfer, you probably won’t play much at country
clubs. But if you do play at a country club, don’t panic. You’re still playing
golf; it’s just that the “goal posts” have been shifted slightly.
To avoid committing any social faux pas, remember a few formalities:
 Before you leave home, make sure you’re wearing the right clothes.
A sweat shirt announcing you as an avid follower of the Chicago Bulls or
those cool (in your mind, anyway) cutoff jeans won’t work in this envi-
ronment. Wear a shirt with a collar and, if shorts are allowed, go for the
tailored variety that stops just short of your knees. Short shorts are a
no-no at most country clubs. In the fall and winter, slacks are acceptable
for women. In the summer, shorts cut just above the knees are fine.
 Get good directions to your destination. It won’t do your heart rate or
your golf game any good to have a stressful journey full of wrong turns.
 Time your arrival so that you have just an hour to spare before you
tee off. When you drive your car up the road toward the clubhouse,
don’t make the simple mistake of turning sharply into the parking lot. Go
right up to the clubhouse. Look for a sign that reads “BAG DROP.” A
person will no doubt be waiting to greet you. Acknowledge his cheery
hello as if this is something you do every day. Tell him who you’re play-
ing with — your host. Then get out of your car, pop the trunk, remove
your spikes and hand him your keys. Tip him a few bucks (or a $5 bill at
a fancy club like Trump International), and stroll into the clubhouse.
Don’t worry about your car or your clubs. The car will be parked for
you, and the clubs will either be loaded onto a cart or handed to a
caddie.
 When you’re inside the clubhouse, head for the locker room. Drop
your street shoes off next to your host’s locker and then ask for direc-
tions to the bar, or to wherever your host is waiting. Don’t offer to buy
your host a drink. First, he or she is the host. And second, you probably
won’t be able to buy anything anyway. Your host will most likely sign the
tab and be billed at the end of the month. (The only place where your
cash/plastic will be accepted is the pro shop. The pro will sell you any-
thing, but take my advice: Skip the purchase of that neat-looking shirt
with the club logo on it. Every time you wear it, people will assume
you’re a member there. The questions will soon get old.)
 If you have a caddie, remember that he or she is there to help you.
Trust your caddie’s advice — he or she knows the course better than
you do. Caddie fees at fancy clubs average about $50, which is added to
your greens fee. You should tip your caddie half the caddie fee at the
end of the round, so that’s another $25. (Savvy golfers sometimes tip the
caddie master before a round — slipping him a $10 bill can get you the
best caddie he’s got.)
74
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

 On the course, be yourself. And don’t worry about shooting the best
round of golf you’ve ever played. Your host won’t expect that. Even if
you happen to play badly, he won’t be too bothered as long as you look
as if you’re having fun and keep trying. Just don’t complain or make
excuses. Nobody likes a whiner.
 After your round, your clubs will probably disappear again — but
don’t worry: They’ll be waiting at the bag drop when you finish your
refreshing post-round beverage. Don’t forget to tip the bag handlers.
Again, a few bucks is usually fine, but be generous if your clubs have
been cleaned.
 When you change back into your street shoes, you’ll often find them
newly polished — that means another few dollars to tip the locker-
room attendant. And when you leave, your golf shoes will have been
done, too. Aren’t country clubs grand?
 One more tip to go: Give a few bucks to the person who delivers your
car back to you and loads your clubs into the trunk.
Resort Courses
You’re on vacation, and you’re dying to play golf. Where to go? To a resort
course, of course. Some of my favorites are Kapalua Resort (Maui, Hawaii),
Doral Golf Resort & Spa (Miami, Florida), and Sea Pines Resort (Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina).
The great thing about resort courses is that you don’t have to be a member
or even have one in tow. The only problem arises when you aren’t staying in
the right place. Some courses are for certain hotel guests only. And again,
prices vary, depending on the course and its location. Generally, though,
resort courses cost a good deal more than public courses.
Phone ahead of time to find out when you can play.
Resort courses are a lot like public courses, but some have bag handlers and
other employees who expect you to tip them. Tip as you would at a private
club.
You’ll probably have to rent a cart, too. Carts are mandatory at almost every
resort golf course in the world. So enjoy the ride! You’ll drive to your drive,
then hop back behind the wheel and putt-putt to your putt.
75
Chapter 5: Where to Play and Who to Play With

How to Fit in on the Course
It starts at the first tee. I cover the gambling aspect of this initial get-together
in Chapter 15, but you should know some other things as well.
If you’re playing with friends, you don’t need any help from me. You know
them, and they know you. You should be able to come up with a game by
yourselves. And you’ll be able to say anything to them, with no risk of offend-
ing anyone.
That’s not the case if you show up looking for a game. Say you’re at a public
course and you’ve asked the starter to squeeze you in (a few bucks will usu-
ally get you going sooner rather than later). Tell the starter your skill level,
and be honest. If you’re a beginner, you don’t want to be teaming up with
three low-handicap players. Forget all that stuff about how the handicap
system allows anyone to play with anyone. That propaganda doesn’t take
human nature into account.
Golf, like life, has its share of snobs. And some of the worst are single-digit
handicappers. Most of them have no interest in playing with you, a mere
beginner. They might say they do, but they’re lying. They see 18 holes with
someone who can’t break 100 as four to five hours of torture. The same is
true on the PGA Tour. Some pros genuinely enjoy the Wednesday Pro-Ams —
Mark O’Meara comes to mind — but many would gladly skip them if they
could. (They can’t, because the tour requires pros to show up for pro-ams.)
The only upside from their point of view is that it represents a practice round
of sorts. Now that may seem like a rotten attitude, but it’s a fact of golfing life.
No one will actually say anything to you (golf pros are generally much too
polite), but the attitude is there. Get used to it.
Maybe I’m being a little harsh, but it’s a fact that golfers are more comfort-
able playing with their “own kind.” Watch a few groups play off the first tee,
and you’ll soon spot a trend. Almost every foursome consists of four players
of relatively equal ability. There’s a reason for that. Make that two reasons:
No one wants to be the weak link in the chain. And no one wants to play with
“those hackers who can’t keep up.”
So let’s say you’re paired with Gary, Jack, and Arnold. Introduce yourself
calmly but quickly. Tell them what you normally shoot, if and when they ask,
and make it clear that you’re a relatively new golfer. This fact is impossible to
conceal, so don’t try. They’ll know within a couple of holes anyway. But don’t
volunteer any further information. Save that for during the round. Besides,
you’ll find that most golfers are selfish — they really don’t care about your
game. They’ll make polite noises after your shots, but that’s the extent of their
interest. You’ll soon be that way, too. There is nothing — nothing — more
76
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

boring than listening to tales about someone else’s round or game. Of course,
boring your buddies that way is part of the social order of this game. Golf sto-
ries are endless, and most are embellished, but they promote the bonding
done over beers in the clubhouse bar, which is also called the 19th hole.
Beginners sometimes do things that mark them as misfits on the course.
Avoid these blunders at all costs:
 Don’t carry one of those telescoping ball retrievers in your bag. It sug-
gests that you’re planning to hit balls in the water.
 Don’t wear your golf cap backward. Ever. No exceptions.
 Don’t do stretching exercises on the first tee. Find a place a few yards
away, where it won’t look like you’re auditioning for Richard Simmons.
 Don’t dawdle when it’s your turn to hit!
When You’re the Worst in Your Group
Early in your golfing existence, almost everyone is better than you. So,
chances are, you’re going to be in a foursome in which you’re the worst
player. What do you do? This section gives you some tips for getting from the
first hole to that cool beverage at the 19th.
Pick it up!
The worst thing you can do is delay play. After you’ve hit the ball, oh, ten
times on a given hole, pick it up and quit that hole as a courtesy to your play-
ing partners. There’s always the next hole.
When you’re actually scoring a game, you’re required to finish out every 
hole — that is, you must post a score for each hole. But beginners should feel
free to skip that technicality. While you’re learning, don’t worry about scores.
Find your own ball
This comes under the “don’t delay” heading. If you happen to hit a shot into
the highest spinach patch on the course, don’t let your companions help you
look for it. Tell them to play on, and you’ll catch up after a “quick look.”
They’ll see you as someone who, though having a bad day, would be worth
playing with again. (If you don’t find the ball within a couple of minutes,
declare it lost and don’t score that hole.)
77
Chapter 5: Where to Play and Who to Play With

Never moan
Don’t be a pain in the you-know-what. Most golfers gripe and moan when
they’re playing poorly. That’s bad — and boring for the other players, who
don’t want to hear about your woes. All they care about is the fact that you’re
slowing things up. So grit your teeth and keep moving.
Never analyze your swing
Here’s another common trap: You hit a few bad shots — okay, more than a
few. Then you start analyzing what you’re doing wrong. Stuff like, “Maybe if I
just turn a little more through the ball. . . .” This is the last thing your playing
partners want to hear. I repeat: They don’t care about your game. So don’t ana-
lyze, and don’t ask them for swing tips. If one is offered, try it, but keep it
quiet.
When You’re Not the Worst
Then there’s the other side of the coin. How do you behave when another
golfer in your group can’t get the ball above shin height? Here are some
pointers:
 Zip that lip. Whatever you do, don’t try to encourage your pal as his or
her game implodes. After a while, you’ll run out of things to say. And
your friend will be annoyed with you.
 Never give advice or swing tips to the other player. You’ll only be
blamed for the next bad shot he or she hits.
 Talk about other stuff. The last thing you should discuss is your pal’s
awful game. Find some common interest and chat about that. Try foot-
ball, movies, or the stock market. Even politics and religion are safer
topics than that 20-yard drive your friend just dribbled off the tee.
Jerk Management
Most golfers are princes — tall, smart and handsome (with or without han-
dlebar mustaches). The game not only tests character, it builds character. I’m
willing to bet there are fewer louts and scoundrels in golf than in any other
major sport. But with more than 25 million American golfers out there, you’re
bound to encounter a few bad apples. Here’s how to have a good day anyway.
78
Part I: Getting Started: No, You Can’t Hit the Ball Yet 

Who not to play with
As I mention earlier, most foursomes are made up of players of roughly equal
ability. That’s what you want. In fact, the best possible scenario is to find
three golfers who are just a little bit better than you. By trying to keep up
with them, you’ll probably improve your usual game.
Those are the sorts of people you should be playing with. The people you
shouldn’t be playing with are those who play a “different game.” That means
anyone who shoots more than 20 shots less than you on an average day. All
someone like that will do is depress you, and your slower, less-expert play
may irritate him or her. Such a situation can bring out the jerk in both of you.
So stay away from the best golfers at your course — at least for now. When
you get better, playing with them will help you improve.
How to survive
Sometimes you can’t help it — you’re stuck with a loud, cursing lunkhead
who talks during your swing, jabbers on his or her cell phone, and gives
everyone unsolicited advice. How to deal?
 At first, ignore the jerk. It’s a beautiful day, and you’re out on the course
playing the best game in the world. Play your game and be glad you’ll
only be spending a few hours with Golfzilla. If the jerk’s behavior annoys
the other members of your group, let them be first to call him or her 
on it.
 If the jerk keeps it up, speak up. Say, “You walked on my putting line —
please don’t.” Or, “You’re distracting me by talking on your cell phone.”
Being firm but polite often works with jerks.
 Treat the jerk as a hazard. If all else fails, think of Golfzilla the way you
think of a strong wind or a lousy lie in a bunker. Golf is all about dealing
with adversity. If you can keep your head and make a good swing despite
the jerk, you’ll be a tougher, better golfer tomorrow.

W
hat is a golf swing? That’s a very good question, one that has different
answers for different people. For most people, a golf swing means
“nonsequential body parts moving in an undignified manner.”
In simple terms, though, a golf swing is a (hopefully) coordinated, balanced
movement of the whole body around a fixed pivot point. If done correctly, this
motion swings an implement of destruction (the club) up, around, and down
so that it hits a ball with an accelerating blow on the center of the clubface.
I’m starting to feel dizzy. How about you?
It All Starts with Balance
Balance is the key to this whole swinging process. You cannot hit the ball
with consistency if at any time during your swing, you fall over. In contrast,
when your swing consists of a simple pivot around a fixed point, the club-
head strikes the ball on the same downward path and somewhere near the
center of the clubface every time. Bingo!
You’re probably wondering where this fixed point in your body is. Well, it
isn’t your head. One great golf myth is that you must keep your head per-
fectly still throughout the swing, which is very hard to do. I don’t advise
keeping your head still . . . unless your hat doesn’t fit.
The fixed point in your golf swing should be between your collarbones and
about 3 inches below them, as shown in Figure 6-1. You should turn and swing
around that point. If you get that pivot point correct, your head will swivel a

little bit as you turn back and then through on your shots. If your head
appears to move like Linda Blair’s did in The Exorcist, you’ve got it wrong.
Your “fixed point”
is 3 inches
below the middle
of your
collarbones.
Your head swivels
to the right as
you swing back . . .

to the finish.

Different Strokes for Different Folks
You can swing the golf club effectively in many ways. For example, there are
long swings and short swings. Imagine that you backed into a giant clock.
Your head is just below the center of the clock. If at the top of your swing
your hands are at 9 o’clock and the clubhead is at 3 o’clock, you’re in the
standard position for the top of your backswing. The shaft is parallel to the
ground.
At the top of John Daly’s swing, which is a long swing, his hands are at 12
o’clock, and the clubhead is approaching 5 o’clock. (Does your chiropractor
have a toll-free number?) Other swings have a shorter arc. John Cook suc-
ceeded on the PGA Tour with a short swing. His hands only go to 8 o’clock,
and the clubhead goes to 1 o’clock. Adam Scott stops short of parallel
because he feels that his swing gets too loose if he goes farther. Physical con-
straints dictate the fullness and length of your swing; the distance the club
travels is unimportant.
Golf swings differ in other ways, too.
 Some players swing the club more around their bodies — the way you’d
swing a baseball bat.
 Others place more emphasis on the role of their hands and arms in the
generation of clubhead speed.
 Still others place that same emphasis on turning the body.
Physique and flexibility play a major role in how you swing a golf club. If
you’re short, you’ll have a flatter swing — more around your body —
because your back is closer to perpendicular at address (the motionless 
position as you stand ready to hit the ball). If you’re tall, you must either use
longer clubs or bend more from the waist at address so that your swing is
more upright. Most tall players develop upright swings.
The left arm always swings about 90 degrees to the angle of the spine. Stand
straight up and put your left arm straight out, away from your body. Now
start bending at the waist. See how your arm lowers? It’s staying 90 degrees
to your back as you bend down. I wish I’d taken more geometry in school!
Flight School
Although you can swing a golf club in many ways, all good swings have a few
common denominators. But before I get to that, I want to break down the fac-
tors of flight:
85
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

 First, you want to hit the ball.
 Second, you want to get the ball up in the air and moving forward.
 Third, you want to hit the ball a long way.
 Fourth, you want to hit the ball a long way while your friends are 
watching.
 And last, you become obsessed, just like the rest of us.
Hitting the ball
You would think hitting the ball would be easy. But golf isn’t tennis or base-
ball, where you can react to a moving ball. In golf, the ball just sits there and
stares at you, beckoning you to make it go somewhere.
Here’s your first thought: “I won’t turn my body too much; I’ll just hit the
thing with my hands.” That’s natural — and wrong. You’re worried about
losing sight of the ball in your backswing and hitting nothing but air. You’re
not alone. We’ve all been through this sweat-drenched nightmare of flailing
failure. But don’t worry. You will evolve! You will make contact!
Getting the ball airborne
Okay, after a few fairly fruitless attempts, you’re finally hitting more ball than
air in your search for flight. Now you need a lesson in the aerodynamics of
the game. The only time you want the golf ball to be on the ground is when
you’re close to the hole. To have any kind of fun the rest of the time, you
want air under the ball; you need the ball to fly! Then you can stare with hor-
rified fascination at the ridiculous places the ball ends up, which is the
essence of the game.
One of my Golf For Dummies secrets is that the only time you should lift
something is when you rearrange your living-room furniture. Never try to lift
a golf ball with your club. You should hit down with every club except the
driver and the putter, as shown in Figure 6-2. And when you do hit down,
don’t duck or lunge at the ball; hit down but keep your head up.
When you use your driver, the ball is set on a tee about an inch above the
ground; if you hit down, the ball will fly off the top edge of the club and the
shot will be high and short — not my favorite combination! With the driver,
you want the clubhead coming into the ball from a horizontal path, moving
slightly up at impact.
When you putt, you don’t want the ball airborne. A putter is designed to roll
the ball along the ground, not produce a high shot. So you need to foster more
of a horizontal hit with that club. (See Chapter 8 for information on putting.)
86
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

If the club in your hands is a fairway wood or an iron, hit down.
Generating power
As soon as the ball is in the air, your ego kicks in. Power with a capital P
becomes your concern. Power intoxicates your mind. Power makes legends
out of mere mortals. Power makes you want to get a tattoo. Power also sends
the ball to the far corners of your little green world if you don’t harness it.
Some professional golfers can create as much as 41⁄2 horsepower in their
swings. That’s some kind of giddy-up. The ball leaves their drivers at speeds
of more than 150 mph. This power comes from a blending of the body twist-
ing around a slightly moving pivot point with a swinging of the arms and
hands up and around on the backswing, and then down and around in the for-
ward swing. All of which occurs in the space of about a second!
The key to optimum power is to try to turn your back to the target on your
backswing (see Figure 6-3), which involves another Golf For Dummies must-
do: On the backswing, turn your left shoulder under your chin until your
shoulder is over your right foot. Make sure that you turn your shoulders far
enough. Don’t just raise your arms. Turning your shoulders ensures that you
have power for the forward move. Turn for power. The unwinding of the hips
and the shoulders on the downswing creates the power surge.

More power for women!
I’ve seen plenty of female golfers with tremen-
dous power — women from Mickey Wright to
Laura Davies to Michelle Wie. But for the most
part, female golfers struggle to generate power.
The average woman simply doesn’t have the
same upper-body, forearm, and wrist strength
as a man. Much to her dismay, she finds it phys-
ically impossible to drive the ball 300 yards.
By doing a few simple strengthening and con-
ditioning exercises (see Chapter 4), female
golfers — or golfers at any level — can
strengthen their upper bodies, wrists, and fore-
arms enough to boost the power in their swings.
Here’s one simple exercise that improves wrist
strength — and you can do it almost anywhere.
Take a tennis ball in your hand and squeeze until
it hurts. Then switch hands and do the same
thing. You don’t have to give yourself carpal
tunnel syndrome — just repeat this exercise for
at least five minutes with each hand. You’ll
notice gradual improvement in your wrist and
forearm strength, which will help you avoid
wrist injury and arm fatigue — and will add
yards to your drives.

The same swing principles apply for women. However, to build momentum
and swing speed, ladies generally rely less on muscle and more on a longer
backswing. A long backswing allows complete rotation in the left shoulder,
which enables the left arm to extend fully and cocks the wrist to help release
power.
Building Your Swing
To become a golfer, you must master the building blocks of your swing. How
do you hold on to the club so that you can give the ball a good whack? After
you have a good grip, how do you align yourself to the target so that the ball
goes somewhere near where you aimed? What should your posture look like?
How much knee flex should you have, and where in the world should the ball
be placed in your stance? Should you look at the ball or somewhere near the
sun? This section has the answers.
For natural left-handers, perfecting the golf swing can be tricky. In the past,
not many clubs were designed for the lefty, and most course designs put left-
handed golfers at a disadvantage. As a result, many lefties were taught to
play right-handed. Today, however, technology has advanced to the point
where lefties have little trouble finding clubs.
Whether you swing left-handed or right-handed, it basically all comes down
to which side has the stronger, most natural-feeling swing. To find out what
works best for you, try swinging the club like a baseball bat from each side
(keeping a safe distance from all breakable objects and small children). The
muscles used in swinging a bat are similar to those used in a golf swing.
Which reminds me of what Sam Snead said when a baseball slugger told him
that hitting a baseball was harder than playing golf. “Maybe,” said Sam, “but I
have to play my foul balls.”
Of course, you may have trouble hitting straight shots on the golf course. If
so, you can always blame the equipment. That’s what I do.
The grip
Although the grip is one of the most important parts of the game, it’s also one
of the most boring. Few golfers who’ve played for any length of time pay
much attention to hand placement. For one thing, your grip is hard to change
after you get used to the way your hands feel on the club. For another, hand
placement simply doesn’t seem as important as the swing itself. That kind of
neglect and laziness is why you see so many bad grips — particularly among
bad players.
89
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Get your grip correct and close to orthodox at the beginning of your golfing
career. You can fake just about anything, but a bad grip follows you to the
grave.
Women tend to have smaller hands than men, so for them, it’s important to
have the right grip size on the club. Another tip for ladies is to use the closed-
face grip position, which can help square the clubface during the swing.
Here’s how to sleep well in eternity with the correct grip. Standing upright,
let your arms hang naturally by your side. Get someone to place a club in
your left hand. All you do now is grab the club and — voilà! — you’ve got
your left-hand grip. Well, almost. The grip has three checkpoints:
1. Place your left thumb and left index finger on the shaft.
I like to see a gap of about 3⁄4 inch between the thumb and index finger.
To get that gap, extend your thumb down the shaft a little. If extending
your thumb proves too uncomfortable, pull your thumb in toward your
hand. Three-quarters of an inch is only a guide, so you have some
leeway. But remember: The farther your thumb extends down the shaft,
the longer your swing. And the opposite is also true. Short thumb means
short swing. (See Figure 6-4.)
2. Make sure the grip crosses the base of your last three fingers and the
middle of your index finger, as shown in Figure 6-5.
This is important. If you grip the club too much in the palm, you hinder
your ability to hinge your wrist and use your hands effectively in the
swing. More of a finger grip makes it easy to cock the wrist on the back-
swing, hit the ball, and then recock the wrist on the follow-through. Just
be sure that the V formed between your thumb and forefinger points
toward your right ear.
Long thumb – long swing
Short thumb – short swing

3. Complete your grip by placing your right hand on the club.
You can fit the right hand to the left in one of three ways: the overlap-
ping (or Vardon) grip, the interlocking grip, or the ten-finger grip. I cover
each of these grips in the following sections.
Vardon grip
The Vardon grip is the most popular grip, certainly among better players. The
great British player Harry Vardon, who still holds the record for British Open
wins — six — popularized the grip around the turn of the century. Old Harry
was the first to place the little finger of his right hand over the gap between
the index and next finger of the left as a prelude to completing his grip, as
shown in Figure 6-6. Harry was also the first to put his left thumb on top of
the shaft. Previously, players kept their left thumbs wrapped around the grip
as if they were holding a baseball bat.
Shaft runs from base
of left pinkie through
middle of index finger.
Make sure
“V” points
at right ear.
Figure 6-5:
Grip more in
the fingers
of the left
hand than in
the palm.
91
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Try the Vardon grip. Close your right hand over the front of the shaft so that
the V formed between your thumb and forefinger points to your right ear. The
fleshy pad at the base of your right thumb should fit snugly over your left
thumb. The result should be a feeling of togetherness, your hands working as
one, single unit.
This grip is very cool — probably 90 percent of tour players use the Vardon
grip.
Interlocking grip
The interlocking grip is really a variation on the Vardon grip. The difference is
that the little finger of your left hand and the index finger of the right actually
hook together (see Figure 6-7). Everything else is the same. You may find this
grip more comfortable if you have small hands. Jack Nicklaus, possibly the
game’s greatest player ever, uses this grip for that reason. Many top women
players use this grip, too.
Figure 6-6:

Vardon grip,

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Ten-finger grip
The ten-finger grip used to be more common, and you still see it occasionally.
Bob Estes has used it on the PGA Tour. Dave Barr — one of the best players
ever from Canada — also uses this grip. The ten-finger grip is what the name
tells you it is. You have all ten fingers on the club, like a baseball player grip-
ping a bat. No overlapping or interlocking occurs; the little finger of the left
hand and the index finger of the right barely touch (see Figure 6-8). If you
have trouble generating enough clubhead speed to hit the ball as far as you
want, or if you’re fighting a slice, give this grip a try. Keep in mind that con-
trolling the clubhead is more difficult with this grip because more “cocking”
of the hands occurs.
Figure 6-7:
An
alternative
is to
interlock the

and left

93
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Completing your grip
Put your right hand on the club, with the palm directly opposite your left
hand. Slide your right hand down the shaft until you can complete whatever
grip you find most comfortable. Your right shoulder, right hip, and head lean
to the right to accommodate the lowering of the right hand. Your right ear-
lobe moves closer to your right shoulder.

You can
place all ten
fingers on

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Your grip pressure should never be tight. Your grip should be light. You
should exert only as much pressure as you would when picking up an egg
from a spotted owl. Lightly now! Spotted owls are becoming extinct!
Aiming
I’ve played pro golf for more than 25 years, which means taking part in a lot
of pro-ams. (In a pro-am, each professional is teamed with three or four ama-
teurs.) And in every single one of those rounds, I saw someone misaligned at
address. Sometimes that someone was me! Aiming properly is that difficult.
Generally speaking, right-handed golfers tend to aim too far right of the
target. I don’t see many of them aiming left — even slicers, whose shots com-
monly start left and finish right. Invariably, people tend to aim right and
swing over the top on the way down to get the ball started left. (For informa-
tion on fixing common faults, see Chapter 11.)
What makes aiming so difficult? Human nature is part of it. Getting sloppy
with your aim is easy when your mind is on other things. That’s why disci-
pline is important. Taking the time and trouble to get comfortable and confi-
dent in his alignment is one reason Jack Nicklaus was as great as he was.
Watch him even now. He still works his way through the same aiming routine
before every shot. And I emphasize routine. First, he looks at the target from
behind the ball. Then he picks out a spot a few feet ahead of his ball on a line
with that target. That spot is his intermediate target. Then he walks to the
ball and sets the clubface behind it so that he’s aiming at the intermediate
point. Aligning the club with something that is 2 feet away is much easier
than aiming at something 150 yards away.
How Nicklaus aims is exactly how you should work on your aim. Think of a rail-
road track. On one rail is the ball and in the distance, the target. On the other
rail are your toes. Thus, your body is aligned parallel with — but left of — the
target line. If you take nothing else away from this section on aiming, remember
that phrase. Cut out Figure 6-9 and tape it onto the ceiling over your bed. Stare
at it before you go to sleep.
Don’t make the mistake that I see countless golfers making: aiming their feet
at the target. If you aim your feet at the target, where is the clubface aligned?
Well to the right of where you want the ball to go. This type of alignment will
usually sabotage the flight of your ball.
95
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

The stance
Okay, you’re aimed at the target. But you’re not finished with your feet yet.
Right now, your feet are not pointing in any direction; you’re just standing
there. All the books tell you to turn your left toe out about 30 degrees. But
what’s 30 degrees? If you’re like me, you have no clue what 30 degrees looks
like or — more important — feels like, so think of 30 degrees this way:
You know what a clock looks like, and you know what the big hand is and
what the little hand does. If you can read a clock, you can build a stance.
Your left foot should be pointed to 10 o’clock, and your right foot should be
at 1 o’clock. However, this does not work during daylight saving time. You’re
on your own then.
Figure 6-10 demonstrates this stance. Keep it simple and always be on time.
Width of stance is easy, too. Your heels should be shoulder-width apart, as
shown in Figure 6-11. Not 14 inches, or 18 inches. Shoulder-width. Let the
shape of your body dictate what’s right for you.
Far too many golfers align their feet
to the right of the target.
Aim the clubface where you want the ball
to go. Your toe line should be parallel to
your target line. 
Figure 6-9:

Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Knee flex
Moving on up, our next stop is at your knees. Again, you can read all sorts of
books that tell you the precise angle at which your knees should be flexed at
address. But that knowledge won’t do you much good when you’re standing
on the range without a protractor. What you need is a feel.
Think of your knee flex as a “ready” position. You’ve got to set yourself so
that movement is easy. So, from an upright start, flex your knees and bend
forward until your arms are hanging vertically, as shown in Figure 6-12. That’s
where you want to be. Just like a quarterback waiting for a snap. Or a soccer
goalkeeper facing a shot. Or a shortstop ready for a ground ball. You’re ready
to move. Left. Right. Back. Forward. Whatever. You’re ready. And remember,
maintaining balance is the key.
Ball position
Where is the ball positioned between your feet? It should be opposite your
left armpit with a driver, which also should be opposite your left heel. For
other clubs, the ball should be steadily moved back with each club until you
get to the middle of your stance with a wedge (see Figure 6-13).
Flex knees and bend forward until arms
hang vertically.
Figure 6-12:
Get “ready.”
98
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

You’re trying to hit up on the ball with your driver — that’s why the ball is
forward in your stance (toward the target). You want to hit down with all
other clubs, which is why you move the ball back in your stance (away from
the target) as the loft of your clubs increases. When the ball is played back in
your stance, hitting down is much easier.
The bottom of the swing
The bottom of the swing is an important, frequently neglected aspect of golf.
After all, that’s usually where the ball is! The arc of the swing has to have a
low point; hopefully, that low point is precisely where your golf ball will be as
you swing an iron. (Remember: The driver must be hit on the upswing.) If
you don’t know where the bottom of your swing is, how do you know where
to put the ball in your stance? You can make the best swing in the world, but
if the ball is too far back, you’ll hit the top half of it. Too far forward is just as
bad — you’ll hit the ground before the ball.
Fear not; such shots are not going to be part of your repertoire. Why?
Because you’re always going to know where the bottom of your swing is:
directly below your head.
For a driver, place the ball opposite your
left armpit.
Figure 6-13:
Ball
position.
99
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Think about it. I’ve already discussed how the ball is positioned opposite the
left armpit for the driver. That position automatically puts your head
“behind” the ball whenever you swing your driver. In other words, the ball is
nearer the target than your head is. Which means that you’ll strike the ball on
a slightly upward blow. The bottom of the swing is behind the ball, so the
clubhead will be moving up as it hits the ball, as shown in Figure 6-14. That’s
all right because the ball is perched on a tee. The only way to make solid con-
tact (and maximize your distance) is to hit drives “on the up.”
The situation for an iron shot from the fairway differs from that of driver from
the tee. Now the ball is sitting on the ground. Plus, the club you’re using has
more loft and is designed to give best results when the ball is struck just
before the ground. So now your head should be over the ball at address and
impact. In other words, something has to move.
That something is the ball. Start from the middle of your stance, which is
where the ball should be when you’re hitting a wedge, one of the shortest
and most lofted clubs in your bag. Move the ball steadily forward — all the
way to opposite your left armpit for the driver — as the club in your hands
gets longer. (See Figure 6-15.)
Figure 6-14:
Hit up.
100
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

For me, the distance between my left armpit and chin is about 6 inches. With
the driver, the ball is opposite my left armpit, and with the shorter irons, it’s
opposite my chin (that is, where my head is). In my case, the ball moves about
6 inches. Most golf courses are about 7,000 yards, so 6 inches shouldn’t have
much significance. Practice this part early in your development and you’ll
have more success with the other 7,000 yards.
You may be a little confused by all of that. It may sound weird that the more
lofted clubs (which hit the highest shots) are back in your stance so that you
can hit down on the ball more. But the explanation is a simple one: The more
the clubface is angled back from vertical, the higher the shot will fly. Thus,
the only way to move a ball from the ground into the air is by exerting down-
ward pressure.
The eyes have it
I see too many players address the ball with their chins on their chests. Or, if
they’ve been told not to do that, they hold their heads so high they can
barely see the ball. Neither, of course, is exactly conducive to good play.
When you use a wedge, place the ball in
the middle of your stance.
As the club gets longer, the ball moves
targetward.
Figure 6-15:
The ball
moves!
101
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

So how should you be holding your head? The answer is in your eyes. Look
down at the ball, which is in what optometrists call your gaze center. Your
gaze center is about the size of a Frisbee. Everything outside your gaze
center is in your peripheral vision. Now lift or drop your head slightly. As
your head moves, so do your eyes, and so does the ball — into your periph-
eral vision. Suddenly you can’t see the ball so well. But if you hold your head
steady enough to keep the ball inside that Frisbee-shaped circle, you can’t go
too far wrong (see Figure 6-16).
One hand away
One last thing about your address position: Let your arms hang so that the
butt end of the club is one hand from the inside of your left thigh, as shown
in Figure 6-17. You should use this position for every club in the bag except
for your putter.
The butt end of the club is a useful guide to check the relationship between
your hands and the clubhead. With a wedge, for example, the butt end of 
the club should be in line with the middle of your left thigh. For a driver, it
should be opposite your zipper. As before, every other club is between those
parameters.
Well, I’ve covered a lot of stuff, and I haven’t even taken a cut at the ball yet.
Work hard on these pre-swing routines. After you get yourself in position to
move the club away from the ball, forget your address position and concen-
trate on your swing. It’s now time to do what you were sent here to do: Create
some turbulence. Now I’ll get on with the swing.
That dictates the
position of your head.

The club should be one hand from your body.
The shaft of a wedge should point at the
crease in your left pant leg (or the middle of
your thigh).
A driver should point at your zipper.

Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Starting the Swing: First, Break It Down
Many people think that the most effective way to develop a consistent golf
swing is to stand on the range whacking balls until you get it right. But the
best way to develop a consistent golf swing is to break the swing down into
pieces. Only after you have the first piece mastered should you move on to
the next one. I start with what I call miniswings.
Miniswings: Hands and arms
Position yourself in front of the ball as I describe earlier in this chapter. Now,
without moving anything except your hands, wrists, and forearms, rotate the
club back until the shaft is horizontal to the ground and the toe of the club is
pointing up. The key to this movement is the left hand, which must stay in
the space that it’s now occupying, in its address position (see Figure 6-18).
The left hand is the fulcrum around which the “swing” rotates. The feeling
you should have is of the butt of the club staying in about the same position
while your hands lift the clubhead.
From address, push down with your left
hand as you pull up with your right.
Rotate the club back until the shaft is
horizontal, the toe pointing up.
Figure 6-18:
Push down,
pull up.
104
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

After you get the hang of that little drill, try hitting shots with your min-
iswing. Let the club travel through 180 degrees, with the shaft parallel to the
ground on the backswing and then back to parallel on the through-swing;
your follow-through should be a mirror image of the backswing. The ball
obviously doesn’t go far with this drill, but your hands and arms are doing
exactly what you want them to do on a full swing: Cock the wrists, hit the
ball, recock the wrists.
After you have this move down, it’s time to turn on the horsepower and get
your body involved in the action.
Test your rhythm
One of the most effective ways for your brain to master something like the
golf swing is to set the motion to music. We all learned our ABCs by putting
the letters to song. I’ve played some of my best golf while humming a Hootie
and the Blowfish tune. Music plays a valuable role in the learning process.
When you start to move the club and your body into the swing, think of a
melody. Make the song real music. Rap, with its staccato rhythm, is no good.
To me, that suggests too much independent movement. The golf swing
should be a smooth motion, so your song should reflect that smoothness.
Think of Tony Bennett, not Eminem.
Anyway, here’s the first step toward adding body movement to the hands-
and-arms motion described in the preceding section. Stand as if at address,
with your arms crossed over your chest so that your right hand is on your
left shoulder and your left hand is on your right shoulder. Hold a club against
your chest with both hands, as shown in Figure 6-19.
Now turn as if you’re making a backswing. Turn so that the shaft turns
through 90 degrees, to the point where the shaft is perpendicular to a line
formed by the tips of your toes. As you do so, let your left knee move inward
so that it points to the golf ball. The real key here is keeping your right leg
flexed as it was at address. Retain that flex, and the only way to get the shaft
into position is by turning your body. You can’t sway or slide to the right and
still create that 90-degree angle.
Your backswing should feel as if you’re turning around the inside of your
right leg until your back is facing the target. That’s the perfect top-of-the-
backswing position.
105
Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Unwinding
From the top, you must let your body unwind back to the ball in the proper
sequence. (Note that your spine angle must stay the same from address to
the top of the backswing.)
Uncoiling starts from the ground up. The first thing to move is your left knee.
That knee must shift toward the target until your kneecap is over the middle
of your left foot, where it stops. Any more shifting of the knee and your legs
will start to slide past the ball. A shaft stuck in the ground just outside your
left foot is a good check that your knee shift hasn’t gone too far. If your left
knee touches the shaft, stop and try again.
Next, your left hip slides targetward until it is over your knee and foot. Again,
a shaft in the ground provides a good test — a deterrent to keep your hip
from going too far.
Pay special attention to the shaft across your chest in this phase of the swing
(work in front of a mirror if you can). The shaft should always parallel the
slope of your shoulders as you work your body back to the ball.
Left hand on right shoulder, right hand on
left shoulder, place a club across your chest.
Then turn the club with your shoulders
through 90 degress.
Figure 6-19:
Turn your
body.
106
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Finishing: Go ahead and pose
“Swing” through the impact area all the way to the finish. Keep your left leg
straight and let your right knee touch your left knee, as shown in Figure 6-20.
Hold this position until the ball hits the ground — that way, you’ll prove
beyond doubt that you’ve swung in balance.
Get yourself together
Practice each of these exercises for as long as you need to. After you put
them together, you’ll have the basis of a pretty good golf swing, one that com-
bines hands/arms and body motion.
 Practice your miniswing.
 Hum a mellow tune.
 Turn your shoulders so that your back is toward the target.
 Put a shaft in the ground — don’t slide.
 At the finish, keep your left leg straight, with your right knee touching
your left knee.
Don't slide
into the shaft

left leg.
Instead, turn
your left hip
inside the shaft.

Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Coordinating all these parts into a golf swing takes time. The action of the parts
will soon become the whole, and you’ll develop a feel for your swing. But
knowledge, in this case, does not come from reading a book. Only repetition —
hitting enough balls to turn this information into muscle memory — will help
you go from novice to real golfer. So get out there and start taking some turf!
Key on the rhythm of your swing. There comes a point in every golfer’s life
when he or she just has to “let it go.” You can work on your mechanics as
much as you want, but then the moment to actually hit a ball comes. And
when that moment comes, you can’t be thinking about anything except, per-
haps, one simple swing key, or swing thought. That’s why top golfers spend
most of their time trying to get into that focused, wordless mental space they
call the zone.
The zone is a state of uncluttered thought, where good things happen with-
out any conscious effort from you. You know the kind of thing: The rolled-up
ball of paper you throw at the trash can goes in if you just toss it without
thinking. The car rounds the corner perfectly if you’re lost in your thoughts.
In golfing terms, getting into the zone means clearing your mind so that your
body can do its job. The mind is a powerful asset, but it can hurt you, too.
Negative thoughts about where your ball might go are not going to help you
make your best swing.
Of course, getting into the zone is easier said than done.
So how do you get there? Perhaps the best way is to focus on the rhythm of
your swing as opposed to mechanics or possible screw-ups. By rhythm, I don’t
mean speed. We’ve seen fast swings and slow swings and a lot in between, and
all can have good rhythm. For example, three-time major winner Nick Price
has a fast swing. Blink and you miss it. In contrast, 1987 Masters winner Larry
Mize has an extremely slow motion. Congress works faster. Yet Price and Mize
both have perfect rhythm. And that perfect rhythm is the key. The rhythm of
your swing should fit your personality. If you’re a fairly high-strung, nervous
individual, your swing is probably faster than most. If your swing is slower,
then you’re probably more laid back and easygoing. The common factor is
that the potential for great rhythm is within every golfer.
Swing triggers: What’s a waggle?
Good rhythm doesn’t just happen. Only on those days when you’re in the
zone can you swing on autopilot. The rest of the time, you’ll need to set the
tone for your swing with your waggle. A waggle is a motion with the wrists in
which the hands stay pretty much steady over the ball and the clubhead
moves back a foot or two, as if starting the swing (see Figure 6-21). In fact, a
waggle is a bit like the miniswing drill I describe in the section “Miniswings:
Hands and arms,” earlier in this chapter.
108
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Waggling the club serves two main purposes.
 Waggling is a rehearsal of the crucial opening segment of the back-
swing.
 Waggling can set the tone for the pace of the swing. In other words, if
you have a short, fast swing, make short, fast waggles. If your swing is of
the long and slow variety, make long, slow waggles. Be true to your
species.
 Make that three main purposes: In golf, you don’t want to start from a
static position. You need a running start to build up momentum and to
keep your swing from getting off to an abrupt, jerky beginning. Waggling
the clubhead eases tension and introduces movement into your setup.
But the waggle is only the second-to-last thing you do before the backswing
begins. The last thing is your swing trigger. A swing trigger can be any kind of
move. For example, 1989 British Open champion Mark Calcavecchia shuffles
his feet. Gary Player, winner of nine major championships, kicks his right
knee in toward the ball. A slight turning of the head to the right is Jack
Nicklaus’s cue to start his swing. Your swing trigger is up to you. Do whatever
frees you up to get the club away from the ball. Create the flow!

Get in
motion.

Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Visualizing shots
As you practice your swing and hit more and more shots, patterns — good
and bad — emerge. The natural shape of your shots becomes apparent. Few
people hit the ball dead-straight; you’ll either fade most of your shots (the
ball flies from left to right, as shown in Figure 6-22) or draw them (the ball
moves from right to left in the air).
If either tendency gets too severe and develops into a full-blooded slice or
hook (a slice is a worse fade, and a hook is a worse draw), you should stop
playing. Go get a lesson. Such severe faults tend to be obvious to the trained
eye. One session with your local pro should get you back on track.
Lessons are important. Faults left to fester and boil soon become ingrained
into your method. When that happens, curing them becomes a lengthy, expen-
sive process. The old adage comes to mind: “Pay me now, or pay me later.”
Pay your pro early, when your woes are easier to fix. (Chapter 3 offers valu-
able information on golf lessons. For a list of golf schools, see Appendix B.)

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 
Kevin Costner’s pre-shot routine
When I started working with Kevin Costner on
his golf game for the movie Tin Cup, one of the
first things we talked about was a pre-shot rou-
tine. Teaching Kevin about the pre-shot routine
this early in his golfing education got him to do
the same thing every time he approached the
ball. We had to get him to look like a real touring
pro, and every pro has his own routine.
Kevin picked up the pre-shot routine really fast.
He would get about 6 feet behind the ball and
look first at the ball, and then at the target
(seeing the target line in his mind’s eye). He
would then walk up and put his clubface right
behind the ball and put his feet on a parallel line
to his target line, which is the best way to estab-
lish the correct alignment. He would then look
at the target once, give the club a little waggle,
and then — whack! — off the ball went. I made
him repeat this routine from the first day we
started working on his swing.
By the time the golf sequences were shot 
for the movie, Kevin had the look of a well-
seasoned touring pro. In fact, as we were walk-
ing down the second hole together in the Bob
Hope Chrysler Classic, I asked Kevin where he
got all his mannerisms — tugging on his shirt,
always stretching his glove by pulling on it, and
pulling his pants by the right-front pocket. He
looked at me and said, “I’ve been watching you
for the past three months.” I had no idea I was
doing all those things in my pre-shot routine! So
I’m living proof that your mannerisms become
automatic if you do them enough.
By the way, my pre-shot routine looks a lot
better when Kevin Costner does it!

Chapter 6: Getting into the Swing of Things

Anyway, after you’ve developed a consistent shape of shot, you can start to
visualize how that shape fits the hole you’re playing. Then, of course, you’ll
know exactly where to aim whether the hole is a dogleg right (turns right),
dogleg left (turns left), or straightaway. You’re a real golfer.
A near-perfect swing — Hey, that’s me!
When you put together all the connected parts I discuss in this chapter, they
should flow into a swing. The first time you see yourself swinging in a series
of photos, a video, or a DVD, you’ll swear that that person is not you. What
your swing feels like versus what really occurs can be deceiving.
The golf swing is nothing more than a bunch of little motions that are
learned, becoming a total motion that is remembered. It’s tempo and rhythm
filtered through your personality. People who rush through life swing fast;
those who go slowly swing like molasses. Remember: Your swing should suit
your personality.
If you can master the basic mechanics described in this book and then apply
them to your own personality, your swing should bloom into something
unique. Work hard to understand your swing and watch how other people
swing at the ball. The great Ben Hogan told me about how he watched other
golfers: If he liked something they did, he would go to the practice tee and
incorporate that particular move into his swing to see if it worked. What
finally came out was a mix of many swings blended to his needs and person-
ality. A champion works very hard.
My golf swing is not the one that got me to the PGA Tour. In 1986, at the age
of 38, I started working with Mac O’Grady to revamp my entire swing. Mac
gave me a model that I used and blended with my existing swing, shown in
the nine photos of Figure 6-23. What came out is a pretty good-looking golf
swing, if I do say so myself. Thanks, Mac, for at least making me look good!

In This Chapter
 Defining your golf personality

 Learning from the greats
T
his chapter comes with the golfing equivalent of a government health warn-
ing: The information on the next few pages isn’t for everyone. That’s not to
say that anything in this chapter is incorrect; it isn’t. But for many people —
especially those at an early stage of development as golfers — it may be too
much to assimilate. Little puffs of smoke will be coming from your ears.
So you need to know yourself psychologically. Say you ordered a computer
and it’s just arrived on your doorstep. You bring the boxes inside and start
tearing them to pieces. You hook this cable to that port and put this on top of
that. You’re flying by the seat of your pants and have no idea what you’re
doing, but you do it anyway. Gone is the idea of looking at the instructions or
reading any print data on how to assemble this new computer. If this scenario
sounds like you, skip this chapter. You already know all you need to know
about the golf swing — at least for now.
If, however, you’re the type who takes a computer home, reads everything in
the box, and goes from page 1 to the end of the instruction manual as you
piece the components together, you’re going to want to know more about the
golf swing before you can play with confidence. Read on to better understand
the complexities of the swing.
What Type of Golfer Are You?
My friend, renowned teacher Peter Kostis, breaks golfers into four types:
 Analytics are organized types. You can always spot their desks — the
neat ones — in the office.
 Drivers, as you’d expect, like to work. They do whatever it takes to get
something done.

 Amiables are easy to deal with. They accept whatever advice you offer
without asking too many questions.
 Expressives don’t mind any environment they happen to find them-
selves in; they adjust to whatever comes their way.
In recent golf history, an analytic is someone like Nick Faldo or Bernhard
Langer. Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, and Annika Sorenstam are drivers. Nancy
Lopez, Fred Couples, and Ben Crenshaw are amiables. And Fuzzy Zoeller and
Lee Trevino are classic expressives.
Drivers and analytics don’t play like amiables and expressives. For a driver or
analytic to score well, he needs confidence in his mechanics. An amiable or
expressive doesn’t — if he feels like he’s playing okay, then his swing must be
okay, too.
The following situation clarifies these differences. Four of the greatest golfers
of our era are playing an exhibition. Lee Trevino, Ben Crenshaw, Jack
Nicklaus, and Nick Faldo are scheduled to tee off at Running Rut Golf Course
precisely at 11 a.m. Because of a mix-up with the courtesy cars that pick up
the players and deliver them to the golf course (Jack and Nick don’t like the
color of their car; Freddy and Ben couldn’t care less), the players are late get-
ting to Running Rut.
When they arrive, with only ten minutes to tee off, the analytic (Faldo) and the
driver (Nicklaus) run out to hit balls before playing. Faldo has to swing to gain
confidence, and Nicklaus has to hit balls because he likes to work at his game.
The other two guys are in the locker room putting on their golf shoes.
Trevino is in deep conversation with the locker-room attendant about the
virtues of not having to tune up his Cadillac for 100,000 miles due to the tech-
nologies of the Northstar system. Crenshaw is puffing on a cigarette, telling a
club member that he was totally flabbergasted yesterday when three 40-foot
putts lipped out and just about cost him his sanity. The expressive (Trevino)
and the amiable (Crenshaw) don’t have to hit balls to get ready. They just go
about their business and don’t worry about a thing.
By the way, the match is called off when Faldo and Nicklaus refuse to come to
the tee because Nick finds something on the practice tee that he wants to
work on and Jack ends up redesigning the practice range. I was told later that
the locker-room attendant bought Trevino’s old Cadillac.
At this stage of your development, being an amiable or an expressive is to
your advantage. Because of the enormous amount of new information that
you have to absorb, anything that prevents confusion is good.
Having said that, this chapter is for all you analytics and drivers out there.
Amiables and expressives — I’ll see you in Chapter 8.
116
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Establishing Your Swing Plane
The swing plane, at its most basic, is the path the club’s shaft follows when
you swing. Unfortunately, many factors affect your swing plane, including
your height, your weight, your posture, your flexibility, the thickness of your
torso, and maybe even the dew point. Swing plane can get complicated —
especially if you want to cover all the possible variations in the plane from
address to the end of the follow-through.
At this point, for all you amiables and expressives, let me expound on the
idea of thinking less about the plane of your swing than about the shape of
your swing. Two of the best players in the game when I was on tour — Greg
Norman and Bruce Lietzke — had totally different planes to their swings. The
golf swing consists of different planes that shift during the course of the
swing. For example, Greg shifted the plane of his swing a little to the outside
on the backswing, and then shifted to the inside on the downswing to achieve
his particular curve of the ball, a draw. Bruce shifted the plane of his swing a
little to the inside on the backswing, and then shifted to the outside on the
downswing to get his particular curve of the ball, a fade.
The plane of your swing is dictated to a large extent by the shaft’s angle at
address. The swing you make with a wedge in your hands is naturally more
upright — or should be — than the swing you make with a driver. The driver
has a longer shaft than the wedge and a flatter lie (the angle at which the
shaft emerges from the clubhead), so you have to stand farther away from
the ball.
For this book, I’m assuming that you maintain the plane you establish at
address throughout the swing. For most players, this isn’t always the case.
If a player’s favored shot is one that bends a great deal in the air, the swing
plane is tilted either to the right or to the left to compensate for the ball’s
flight. But if you’re trying to hit straight shots, one consistent plane is the
way for you.
Mastering the checkpoints
The easiest way to keep your swing on plane is to have a series of check-
points, as shown in Figure 7-1. By the way, I’m assuming that you’re swinging
a driver and that you’re right-handed. Here are the checkpoints:
117
Chapter 7: Refining Your Swing

Start with the shaft
at 45 degrees
to the ground.
Impact should look
a lot like address,
except that the hips
are opening to
the target.
45
At the top, the shaft
should be parallel
with a line along
your heels.
Figure 7-1:
The swing
plane.
118
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

 Checkpoint #1: The first checkpoint is at address. The shaft starts at a
45-degree angle to the ground.
 Checkpoint #2: Now swing the club back until your left arm is horizontal.
At that point, the club’s butt end (the end of the grip) points directly
along the target line. (The target line is the line between the target and
the ball. That line also continues forward past the target in a straight line
and beyond the ball going in the opposite direction in a straight line.
What I’m talking about in this case is one long, straight line.) If the end of
the grip is pointing along the target line, you’re on plane. If the end of the
grip points above the target line, your swing is too flat, or horizontal; if
the grip end is below the target line, your swing is too upright, or vertical.
 Checkpoint #3: At the top of your backswing, the club should be parallel
with a line drawn along your heels. That’s on plane. If the club points to
the right of that line, you’ve crossed the line and will probably hook the
shot. A club pointing to the left of that line is said to be laid off. In that
case, expect a slice.
 Checkpoint #4: Halfway down, at the point where your left arm is again
horizontal, the shaft’s butt end should again point at the target line. This
position and the one described in the second checkpoint on this list are,
in effect, identical in swing-plane terms.
 Checkpoint #5: Impact is the most important point in the golf swing. If
the clubface is square when it strikes the ball, what you do anywhere
else doesn’t really matter. But if you want to be consistent, try to visual-
ize impact as being about the same as your address position, except
your hips are aimed more to the left of the target than at the address
position, and your weight is shifting to the left side.
To analyze your swing, use a video, a series of still photos, or a mirror — or
have someone watch you.
Now remember, this method of mastering your checkpoints is a perfect-world
situation. Your size, flexibility, and swing shape will probably produce differ-
ent results. Don’t be alarmed if you don’t fit this model perfectly; no more
than a dozen players on the PGA Tour do. As with anything else, there’s room
for deviation.
At the top
Take a closer look at the top of the backswing. If you can get the club on
plane at the top, you’ll probably hit a good shot.
119
Chapter 7: Refining Your Swing

Look for four things in your backswing:
 Your left arm and your shoulders must be on the same slope. In other
words, your arm and shoulders are parallel.
 The top of your swing is basically controlled by your right arm, which
forms a right angle at the top of the swing (see Figure 7-2). Your elbow
is about a dollar bill’s length away from your rib cage.
 Your shoulders turn so that they’re at 90 degrees to the target line.
 The clubface is angled parallel to your left arm and your shoulders.
Your left wrist controls this position. Ideally, your wrist angle remains
unchanged from address to the top. That way, the relationship between
the clubface and your left arm is constant. If your wrist angle does
change, the clubface and your left arm will be on different planes — and
that’s a problem.
If your wrist angle changes, it’s either bowed or cupped (see Figure 7-3). A
bowed (bent-forward) left wrist at the top makes the clubface “look” skyward
in what is called a closed position. From that position, a hook is likely. A
cupped (bent-backward) wrist makes the clubface more visible to someone
looking you in the face. A cupped wrist leads to an open position, which
probably results in a slice.
Of course, playing good golf from an open or closed position at the top of the
backswing is possible. It’s just more difficult. To do well, your swing has to
have some kind of built-in compensation that will square the clubface at
impact. And compensations take a lot of practice. Only if you have the time
to hit hundreds of balls a week can you ever hope to play well with an inher-
ently flawed swing. Even then, that compensated swing is going to be tough
to reproduce under pressure. For famous examples, watch Corey Pavin
(open) and Lee Trevino (closed).
Your right arm
should form a right
angle at the elbow.
Figure 7-2:
Check-
point — get
this angle
right.
120
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Anyway, swing sequences tend to show three very different methods. The
legendary Sam Snead crossed the line at the top and came over every shot to
get the ball to go straight. Annika Sorenstam is the opposite: She lays the
club off at the top. And 1995 PGA Champion Steve Elkington stays on plane.
Make a swing like his your model, and you can’t go too far wrong.
Going Where Others Have Gone Before
No matter what your skill level, a great way to improve is to watch other play-
ers, particularly those with some of the same characteristics that you have.
Watch for similarities in body size, pace, and shape of swing — even the
kinds of mistakes they make under pressure.
Start by identifying your goals. Do you want to emulate the masters of the
long game, guys like John Daly, Ernie Els, and Davis Love III, who regularly
blast drives beyond 300 yards? Or do you want to concentrate on following
the short-game experts, such as all-time great Walter Hagen and tour veteran
Brad Faxon? Phil Mickelson is long off the tee and has a great lob wedge.
Tiger Woods, of course, does everything well.
When your left wrist is “bowed,”
watch out for a hook.
When your left wrist is “cupped,”
watch out for a slice.
Figure 7-3:

business.

Chapter 7: Refining Your Swing

If you want to follow some really fine putting, keep your eyes peeled for my
Champions Tour colleague Isao Aoki of Japan, who has a unique putting
stroke acutely tailored to Japanese grass. Some of the best putters in the
world today are Faxon, Mickelson, and Jim Furyk. Nancy Lopez was another
great putter in her heyday.
Maybe swing speed is your demon. Are you trying too hard to copy someone
you admire, or are you making sure that the pace you use is as natural for
you as tour golfers’ swings are for them? Down through the years, Ben
Crenshaw, Nancy Lopez, and Jay Haas have displayed slow-paced swings.
Larry Mize’s swing was always extremely slow. Davis Love III, Jack Nicklaus,
Sam Snead, and Annika Sorenstam have all won with medium-paced swings.
Ben Hogan, Lanny Wadkins, and Tom Watson all swung fast. One of the quick-
est swingers of all is Nick Price. And all those players have had great careers.
Hand size can affect grip; grip can affect your swing. Billy Casper was an all-
time great putter who used his wrists to create momentum in the clubhead
during his putting stroke. Fred Couples uses the cross-handed grip for
putting. Jack Nicklaus uses the interlocking grip for his golf swing. Tom Kite
uses the interlocking grip for full swings and the cross-handed grip for
putting. Chris DiMarco, who was once such a poor putter he almost quit the
tour, made it big with a grip called “the claw.”
Maybe you want to keep tabs on golfers who have modified their games to
see how a pro adapts his or her game, either to combat the yips, as did
Bernhard Langer, who invented his own grip, and Sam Snead, who putted
sidesaddle, or to accommodate a new tool, like the long putter Tom Lehman
switched to. Vijay Singh used a belly putter — longer than a standard flatstick,
shorter than a long putter — until he switched back to a standard model and
played better than ever!
Notice how the attitudes of famous players affect not only how they play but
also how much they enjoy the game. Arnold Palmer was a master of special
shots, a bold golfer. Other daring players include Mickelson and John Daly,
who are as fun and exciting to watch as expressive golfers Lee Trevino and
Fuzzy Zoeller. Fred Funk is another fan favorite whose pleasure in playing is
infectious. On the other end of the attitude spectrum, you’ll find Hall of
Famer Jackie Burke, who created intense drills for himself so that he knew all
about pressure: His motivation was to win. Ben Hogan was another steely
competitor, a perfectionist who surrendered finally not to any other player
but to the yips. (See Chapter 8 for more on the yips.) Other hard-working per-
fectionists include Jack Nicklaus, Annika Sorenstam, and Tom Watson.
Whoever you choose to emulate, remember that golf is an individualist’s
game. You can mix and match facets of great players’ styles, or develop your
own — whatever works for you.

T
his chapter is one of the most important in the book. Statistically, putting
is 68 percent of the game of golf, so you may want to take notes. You’d be
smart to keep a “reminder book” full of putting tips from this chapter, because
you can’t score well if you can’t putt — it’s that simple. If you want proof, 
look at the top professionals on tour who average about 29 putts per round. 
In other words, these professionals are one-putting at least 7 of the 18 greens
in a round of golf. The average score on tour isn’t 7 under par, so even these
folks are missing their fair share of greens. And where are they retrieving their
mistakes? That’s right: with their short games and putting.
Golfers often say they’re rolling the rock on the green, rather than rolling the
ball. Don’t ask me why. I suspect it has to do with the difficulty of rolling a
hard, irregular object that can hurt you. Or maybe rock and roll just go
together.
No other part of golf induces as much heartache and conversation as putting.
Many fine strikers of the ball have literally been driven from the sport because
they couldn’t finish holes as well as they started them. Why? Because putting
messes with your internal organs. Every putt has only two possibilities: You
either miss it or hole it. Accept that and you won’t have nightmares about the
ones that “should” have gone in.

You Gotta Be You
Putting is the most individual part of this individual game. You can putt —
and putt successfully — in myriad ways. You can break all the rules with a
putter in your hands as long as the ball goes in the hole. Believe me, you can
get the job done by using any number of methods. You can make long, flow-
ing strokes like Phil Mickelson and Ben Crenshaw. Or shorter, firmer, “pop”
strokes like Corey Pavin and Gary Player. Or you can create the necessary
momentum in the clubhead with your wrists — the great Billy Casper proved
how well that can work. Or if none of these styles appeals to you, you can
switch to a “belly putter” — Vijay Singh tried that — or go to a long, “witch’s
broom-handle” putter. Golfers from PGA Tour star Tom Lehman to former
president George H. Bush have had success with long putters.
Putting is more about those ghostly intangibles — feel, touch, and nerve —
than about mechanics. My feeling is that getting too involved with putting
mechanics is a mistake. You can have the most technically perfect stroke in
the world and still be like an orangutan kicking a football on the greens — if
you don’t have the touch, that is.
Even more than the rhythm and tempo of your full swing, your putting stroke
should reflect your own personality. Your hands probably shouldn’t be
“behind” the ball at impact, but other than that, your style is up to you.
Be aware that if any aspect of this often-infuriating game were ever designed
to drive you to distraction, it’s putting. Putting may look simple — and some-
times it is — but on some days you just know that little ball at your feet will
never make its way into that hole. You know it, your playing partners know it,
your financial consultant knows it, everyone knows it. Putting is mystical; it
comes and goes like the tide.
Because most women can’t physically drive the ball hundreds of yards, they
should focus on refining their short-game skills, such as chipping, pitching,
and putting. Remember: A solid putt counts the same on the score card as a
200-yard drive.
Mind Games
In putting, visualization is everything. You can visualize in two ways: Either
you see the hole as very small, or so big that any fool can drop the ball in. 
The former, of course, is infinitely more damaging to your psyche. When 
you imagine that the hole shrinks, the ball doesn’t seem to fit. You can keep
124
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

telling yourself that the ball is 1.68 inches in diameter and the hole 4.25 inches
across, but the fact remains that the ball is too big. I know; I’ve been there. It
just won’t fit. It won’t fit no matter what I do. When I start thinking that way, I
usually seek psychiatric care and surround myself with pastel colors.
And on other days, happily, the hole is so big that putting is like stroking a
marble into the Grand Canyon. Simply hit the ball, and boom, it goes in.
When this happens to you, savor every moment. Drink in the feeling and
bathe in it so that you don’t forget it — because you may not take another
bath like that for a long time.
The crazy thing is that these two scenarios can occur on consecutive days,
sometimes even in consecutive rounds. I’ve even experienced both feelings
on consecutive holes! Why? I have no idea. The answer is way beyond my
feeble intellect. Try not to think too deeply about putting.
The Most Important Club in the Bag
Because putting is such a crucial part of the game, it follows that your putter
is the most important weapon you’ve got. Club makers seem to have noticed:
In recent years they’ve brought out a dizzying array of high-tech putters.
Some are as sleek as a sports car, while others look more like anvils or space-
ships. One new model has been likened to “a fire hydrant on a stick.” How
can you choose the putter that’s best for your game? It’s probably not as
tricky as you think.
Your stroke shape tells you 
which putter you need
Although you have a lot of putters to choose from, you can eliminate many
by knowing the type of putter you are. In other words, the shape of your
stroke is the main factor in choosing a putter. Figure 8-1 shows two types 
of putters.
My good friend and noted teaching professional Peter Kostis explains that
almost all putting strokes fall into one of two shapes. They either move
“straight back and straight through” with the blade staying square, or “inside
to inside,” the blade doing a miniversion of the rotation found in a full swing.
Conveniently, most putters are designed to suit a specific stroke shape. There
are two main types: (1) face-balanced, center-shafted putters and (2) those
that are not face-balanced, such as heel-shafted blades.
125
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

The key to success is matching your putter to your stroke. If keeping the
blade square throughout the putting stroke is your style, get a face-balanced,
center-shafted model. You can test to see if a putter is face-balanced by rest-
ing the shaft on your finger. If the putterface stays parallel to the ground, it’s
face-balanced.
The inside-to-inside stroke is easier to make on a consistent basis with a 
heel-shafted putter. It will hang toe-down while resting on your finger.
Be warned, though. Some putters hang at an angle of 45 degrees. They’re
equally good — or bad! — for either stroke.
High-tech putters: From MOI to you
Don’t be confused by all the high-tech (and high-priced) new putters on the
market. Figure 8-2 shows several popular ones. Although they appear as col-
orful and as different as new cars, most offer only one or two features that
may even make them worth the price.
Figure 8-1:
Which kind
of putter?
126
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

One term that puzzles most beginners is MOI, which is short for moment of
inertia. It sounds scientific, and in fact there’s a lot of science behind the new
MOI putters, but you don’t have to bother with that. All you need to know is
that MOI putters resist twisting on off-center hits. That means that your bad
putts turn out better than they would otherwise. How much better? That’s
hard to say, but a 2005 study cited in Golf Digest suggested that an MOI putter
might make a 4-foot difference on a 22-foot putt. That’s a massive difference —
almost as massive as some of these putters.
Many modern putters also feature alignment aids, like the pair of white cir-
cles behind the face of Odyssey’s popular 2-Ball putters. Other manufacturers
put bold lines or arrows on their putters to help golfers start the ball on the
target line. (For more on alignment, see “The Art of Aiming the Ball,” later in
this chapter.) Another new wrinkle is adding an insert to the face of the
putter — often a panel of urethane, the same stuff golf balls are made of —
for a softer feel when the putter strikes the ball.
As with other technological advances, from titanium drivers to graphite
shafts to super-comfy golf shoes, such features have their benefits — espe-
cially if you believe they’ll help your game. Because, as you know by now, this
game is as mental as anything.
Still, the best feature of all is sound fundamentals. Without them, all the tech
support in the world won’t do you much good.

Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

Long putters and belly putters — 
it’s a long story
Some golfers swear by extra-long putters. Others swear at them, saying the
long putter is bizarre and ought to be illegal. There is even talk of banning
long putters. But if you’re struggling to make putts, you may want give one 
of them a try.
The terminology can be confusing: What’s the difference between a long
putter and a belly putter? But it’s simple if you know the crucial difference:
Both are longer than a standard model, but a long putter is lo-o-onnnger. Its
handle goes under the golfer’s chin, while the handle of a belly putter is
anchored to the belly. Both are used almost exclusively by players who’ve
struggled to make putts the usual way.
Long putters
The long putter is the final refuge of the neurologically impaired. If you watch
any Champions Tour event on TV, you’ll see more than a few long putters.
There are even a few on the PGA Tour.
Long putters range from 46 inches in length to 50 and up. They remove all
wrist action from your putting stroke because your left hand anchors the
club to your chest. Your left hand holds the club at the end of the shaft, and
your fingers wrap around the grip so that the back of that hand faces the ball.
The grip is the fulcrum around which the club swings. Your right hand is basi-
cally along for the ride. In fact, your right hand should barely touch the club.
Its only role is to pull the club back and follow the club through.
Long putters are easy on the nerves, which is why these clubs enjoy such
popularity on the Champions Tour. But to be fair, senior players are not
alone. No fewer than three members of the European Ryder Cup team in 1995
used long putters. And all three members won their singles matches on the
final afternoon, perhaps the most pressure-packed day in all of golf. So long
putters definitely have something going for them. You’ve got nothing to lose
by trying one.
Belly putters
A recent variation on the long putter is the midlength belly putter. You anchor
it to your midsection, so that it looks like the club is stabbing you in the navel.
Belly putters are 40 to 45 inches long. Like long putters, they’re designed to
minimize wrist action in the stroke. Vijay Singh, Fred Couples, and other pros
have fought putting woes with these midlength mallets, though Singh putted
better when he went back to a standard model.
128
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

If you’re struggling with jumpy wrists on the greens, you may want to try the
belly method. (Keep in mind that it takes patience.) But remember: Like the
long putter, the belly putter is generally seen as a last resort. If you can make
putts with a standard-length putter, that’s what you should use.
Building Your Stroke
As I’ve already said, you can putt well by using any number of methods or
clubs. But I’m going to ignore that for now. At this stage, you should putt in 
as orthodox a manner as possible. That way, when something goes wrong —
which it will — the fault is easier to fix. The trouble with being unorthodox is
that it’s hard to find order in chaos.
The putting grip
The putting grip isn’t like the full-swing grip. The full-swing grip is more 
in the fingers, which encourages your wrists to hinge and unhinge. Your 
putting grip’s purpose is exactly the opposite. You grip the putter more in 
the palm of your hands to reduce the amount of movement your hands make.
Although you may putt well with a lot of wrist action in your stroke, I prefer
that you take the wrists out of play as much as possible. Unless you have
incredible touch, your wrists are not very reliable when you need to hit the
ball short distances. You’re far better off relying on the rocking of your shoul-
ders to create momentum in the putterhead.
Not all putting grips are the same — not even those grips where you place
your right hand below the left in conventional fashion. But what all putting
grips have in common is that the palms of both hands face each other so
your hands can work together. The last thing you want is your hands fighting
one another. Too much of either hand, and your ball has a bad experience. If
your left hand dominates, your right hand sues for nonsupport. Both hands
need to work together for a good experience with no legal hassles.
Your hands can work together in one of two ways, as shown in Figure 8-3. Start
by placing the palms of your hands on either side of the club’s grip. Slide your
right hand down a little so that you can place both hands on the club. You
should feel like you’re going to adopt the ten-finger grip (see Chapter 6). Then
do one of the following, depending on which grip you prefer:
 Place your left index finger over the little finger of your right hand.
Known as the reverse overlap, this is probably the most popular putting
grip on the PGA and LPGA tours.
129
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

 Extend your left index finger past the fingers of your right hand until the
tip touches your right index finger. I call this grip the extended reverse
overlap. The left index finger, when extended, provides stability to the
putting stroke.

130
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Go with the grip that you find most comfortable. I describe other methods of
gripping the putter in the following sections.
Left hand low
This method is commonly referred to as cross-handed. The left hand hangs
below the right with the putter (or vice versa if you’re a lefty). Many players
use this method today because it helps keep the lead hand (the left, in this
case) from bending at the wrist as you hit the ball. (See Figure 8-4.)
One of the biggest causes of missed putts is the breakdown of the left wrist
through impact. When the left wrist bends through impact, the putter blade
twists. This twisting causes the ball to wobble off-line, even if you’ve got an
MOI putter. That’s why you should maintain the bend of your left wrist from
the address position all the way through the stroke.
A left-hand-below-right putting grip
helps stop left-wrist breakdown.
Figure 8-4:
Keep that
left wrist
firm.
131
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

The cross-handed grip can make it easier to maintain that wrist position.
Great players — including Fred Couples and Tom Kite — have gone to this
type of grip.
The few times I’ve tried the cross-handed grip, pulling with the left wrist
seemed to be easier. It seems that pulling with the lead hand makes it harder
to break down with the wrist.
Another reason you see many of today’s pros using a cross-handed grip is
that, with the left arm lower on the shaft, you pull the left shoulder more
square to your target line. Pulling your left shoulder happens automatically
with this grip. I tend to open my shoulders (aim to the left) with my putter. As
soon as I tried a cross-handed grip, my left shoulder moved toward the target
line, and I was more square to my line.
I think the best asset that this stroke has to offer is that you swing the left
arm back and forth during the stroke. The trailing hand (right) goes along for
the ride, which is a very good way to stroke your golf ball. I suggest that you
try putting with your left hand low. You might stick with this method forever.
The “claw”
This weird-looking grip got a huge boost at the 2005 Masters, where claw-
gripper Chris DiMarco took eventual winner Tiger Woods into a thrilling 
playoff. To try the claw, start with a standard putting grip. Turn your right
palm toward you and bring it to the putter’s handle so that the handle
touches the spot between your thumb and index finger. Now bring your 
index and middle fingers to the shaft, leaving your ring finger and pinkie 
off, as shown in Figure 8-5.
DiMarco had gone through a spell of such terrible putting that he nearly 
gave up hope; with this grip he rejuvenated his career and clawed his way 
to the top.
Putting posture: Stand and deliver
As you crouch over the ball to putt, you need to be in the correct position.
You should have a slight knee flex in your putting stance. If your knees are
locked, you’re straining your back too much. Don’t bend your knees too
much, though, because you may start to look like a golf geek!
Bend from your waist so that your arms hang straight down. This allows 
your arms to swing in a pendulum motion, back and forth from a fixed point.
Hold your arms straight out from your body. Bend down with those arms 
outstretched from the waist until your arms are pointing to the ground. 
Now flex your knees a little bit, and you’re in the correct putting posture.
132
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

You can break a lot of rules in how you stand to hit a putt (see Figure 8-6).
Ben Crenshaw stands open to the target line, his left foot drawn back. Gary
Player always did the opposite: He set up closed, his right foot farther from
the target line than his left. But that’s their style; I keep things simple with a
square stance so that I don’t need to make many in-stroke adjustments to
compensate.
Toeing the line
As in a full swing, the line of your toes is the key. Regardless of which stance
you choose, your toe line should always be parallel to your target line. Be
aware that the target line isn’t always a straight line from the ball to the hole —
if only putting were that simple. Unfortunately, greens are rarely flat, so putts
break or bend from right to left or from left to right. (See “Reading the break,”
later in this chapter.) So sometimes you’ll be aiming, say, 5 inches to the right
of the hole, and other times maybe a foot to the left (see Figure 8-7). Whatever
you decide, your toe line must be parallel to your target line.
Figure 8-5:
The claw

weird, but it
may work.
133
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

To putt, you can stand open.
Or closed.
Or square.
Figure 8-6:

134
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Being parallel to your target line is vital. In effect, you make every putt
straight. Applying a curve to your putts is way too complicated and affects
your stroke. Imagine how you’d have to adjust if you aimed at the hole and
then tried to push the ball out to the right because of a slope on the green.
You’d have no way to be consistent. So keep putting simple. On breaking
putts, aim your feet parallel to the line you’ve chosen, not toward the hole
(see Figure 8-8).

135
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

Standing just right
Okay, now what about width of stance? Again, you have margin for error, but
your heels need to be about shoulder-width apart at address, as shown in
Figure 8-9.
You have to bend over to place the putter behind the ball. How far should
you bend? Far enough to get your eye line (a much-neglected part of putting)
directly over the ball. To find out how that position feels, place a ball on your
forehead between your eyes, bend over, and let the ball drop, as shown in
Figure 8-10. Where does the ball hit the ground? That’s where the ball should
be in relation to your body. It shouldn’t be to the inside, the outside, behind,
or in front of that point. It should be right there, dead center. This alignment
places your eyes not just over the ball but also over the line that you want
the ball to travel.
Getting up to speed
In the two decades–plus that I played on the PGA Tour, I saw a lot of golfers
with a lot of different putting methods. The good putters came in all shapes
For putting, your heels should be
shoulder-width apart.
Figure 8-9:
Heels and
shoulders

same width.
136
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

and sizes, too. Some putted in what could be termed mysterious ways, and
others were totally conventional. So analyzing different putting methods is no
help. The best way to look at putting is to break it down to its simplest level.
The hole. The ball. The ball fits into the hole. Now get the ball into the hole in
the fewest possible strokes.
You want to get the ball rolling at the right speed. If you don’t have the speed,
you can’t know where to aim. The right speed means hitting a putt so that if
the ball misses the cup, it’ll finish 14 to 18 inches past the hole, as shown in
Figure 8-11. This distance is true no matter the length of the putt. Two feet or
40 feet, your aim must be to hit the ball at a pace that will see it finish 14 to
18 inches beyond the hole. If it doesn’t go in, that is.
You’re probably wondering why your ball needs the right speed. Well, the
right speed gives the ball the greatest chance of going into the hole. Think
about it: If the ball rolls toward the middle of the cup, you don’t want it
moving so fast that it rolls right over the hole. If it touches either side of the
cup, it may drop in. Your goal is to give the ball every chance to drop in, from
any angle — front, back, or side. I don’t know about you, but I want that hole
to seem as big as possible.
Drop the ball from a point
between your eyes.
Where the ball lands is where it should
be positioned in
your stance.
Figure 8-10:

137
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

The only putts I know that never drop are the ones you leave short of the
hole. If you’ve played golf for any length of time, you’ve heard the phrase
“never up, never in.” The cliché is annoying but true. As the Irish say, “Ninety-
nine percent of all putts that come up short don’t go in, and the other 1 per-
cent never get there.” Remember that saying! Also remember that you should
try to make every putt that stops 10 feet from the hole or closer. I hope to
make every putt from 10 to 20 feet, and I try to get every putt close from 20
feet and beyond.
Reading the break
After you have the distance control that a consistent pace brings, you can
work on the second half of the putting equation: reading the break. The break
is the amount a putt moves from right to left, or left to right, on a green. Slope,
topographical features such as water and mountains, the grain of the grass,
and, perhaps most important, how hard you hit the ball dictate the break. For
Figure 8-11:
Just past:
Here’s how
hard to hit
your putts.
138
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

example, if I am an aggressive player who routinely hits putts 5 feet past the
cup, I’m not going to play as much break as you do. (Remember: You should
hit your putts only 14 to 18 inches past the cup.)
The firmer you hit a putt, the less the ball breaks on even the steepest gradi-
ent. So don’t be fooled into thinking that there’s only one way a putt can be
holed. On, say, a 20-footer, you probably have about five possibilities. How
hard you hit the ball is one factor.
The key, of course, is consistency. Being a bold putter is not a bad thing (if
you’re willing to put up with the occasional return 5-footer), as long as you
putt that way all the time — and are still in your teens.
The first thing I do when I arrive at a golf course is to find the natural slope of
the terrain. If there are mountains nearby, finding the natural slope is easy.
Say the mountains are off to your right on the first hole. Any slope will run
from right to left on that hole. In fact, the slope on every green is going to be
“from” the mountain (unless, of course, a particularly humorless architect
has decided to bank some holes toward the mountain). So I take that into
account on every putt I hit.
If the course is relatively flat, go find the pro or course superintendent. Ask
about nearby reservoirs or, failing that, the area’s lowest point. This point
can be 5 miles away or 20 — it doesn’t matter. Find out where that point is
and take advantage of gravity. Gravity is a wonderful concept. Every putt
breaks down a hill — high point to low point — unless you’re in a zero-gravity
environment. But that’s another book.
After you know the lowest point, look at each green in detail. If you’re 
on an older course, the greens probably slope from back to front because of
drainage. Greens nowadays have more humps and undulations than ever and
are surrounded by more bunkers. And the sand tells a tale: Most courses are
designed so that water runs past a bunker and not into it. Take that insight
into account when you line up a putt.
And don’t forget the barometric pressure and dew point — just kidding! (For
fun and entertaining information about sand play, see Chapter 10.)
Reading the grain
Golf is played on different grasses (ideally, not on the same course). Climate
usually dictates the kind of grass you find on a course. Grasses in hot, tropical
areas have to be more resilient, so they typically have thick blades. Bermuda
grass is the most common. Its blades tend to follow the sun from morning to
139
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

afternoon — in other words, from east to west. Because the blade is so strong,
Bermuda grass can carry a golf ball according to the direction in which it is
lying. Putts “downgrain” go faster than putts “into” the grain. All that, of
course, has an effect on where you have to aim a putt.
Look at the cup to find out which way the grass is growing. Especially in the
afternoon, you may see a ragged half and a smooth, or sharp, half on the lip
of the cup — that shows the direction in which the grass is growing. The
ragged look is caused by the grass’s tendency to grow and fray. If you can’t
tell either way, go to the fringe (the edge of the green). The grass on the fringe
is longer, so you can usually see the direction of the grain right away.
Another common type of grass is bent grass. You see this strain of grass
mostly in the northern and northeastern United States. Bent grass has a 
thinner blade than Bermuda grass, but it doesn’t stand up to excessive 
heat as well.
Bent grass is used by many golf-course builders because it allows them to
make the greens fast, and the recent trend for greens is to combine slope
with speed. Try getting on the roof of your car, putting a ball down to the
hood ornament, and making it stop. That’s the speed of most of the greens 
on tour with bent grass.
I don’t concern myself much with grain on bent greens. I just worry about 
the slope and the 47 things on my checklist before I putt. Putting could be 
so much fun if I didn’t have a brain.
If you get the chance to play golf in Japan, you’ll play on grass called korai.
This wiry grass can be a menace on the greens because it’s stronger than
AstroTurf and can really affect the way the ball rolls on the green. If the blades
of grass are growing toward you, you have to hit the ball with a violent pop.
Isao Aoki, a great Japanese player, developed a unique putting stroke in
which he kept the toe of the putter way off the ground and then gave the ball
a pop with his wrist to get it going — an effective way of dealing with the
korai grass he grew up on.
When dealing with grasses, an architect tries to use the thinnest possible
blade, given the climate, and then tries to get that grass to grow straight up
to eliminate grain. Bent is better than Bermuda when it comes to growing
straight, so grain is rarely a factor on bent greens.

Bobbing for plumbs
Plumb-bobbing is all about determining where vertical is. It lets you see how
much break a putt will have. Plumb-bobbing is one reason — along with old-
fashioned polyester pants and electric carts — that nongolfers laugh at golfers.
When a plumb-bobbing golfer pops up on TV, all the nongolfer sees is a guy,
one eye closed, standing with a club dangling in front of his face. Actually, the
whole thing does look more than a little goofy. I can’t honestly say that I’m a
devotee of the method, although plumb-bobbing works for some people. I use
plumb-bobbing only when I’m totally bored on the green or if I think that one of
the condos on the course was built on a slant. But if Ben Crenshaw thinks that
plumb-bobbing helps, who am I to argue?
The first step in plumb-bobbing is to find your dominant eye. You close the
other eye when plumb-bobbing. Here’s how to find yours.
Make a circle with the thumb and index finger of your right hand a couple of
inches in front of your face, as shown in Figure 8-12. Look through the circle
at a distant object. Keep both eyes open at this stage. Now close your right
eye. Where is the object now? If the object is still in the circle, your left eye is
dominant. If, of course, you can still see the object in the circle with your left
eye closed, your right eye is dominant.
Figure 8-12:
Find your
dominant
eye.

Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

Okay, now you’re ready to plumb-bob. Put some dancing shoes on and stand
as close to the ball as possible. First, keeping your dominant eye open, hold
your putter in front of your face and perpendicular to the ground so that the
shaft appears to run through the ball. Now look to see where the hole is in
relation to the shaft. If the hole appears to the right of the club, the ball will
break from the shaft to the hole — from left to right. If the hole is on the left,
the opposite will be true. (See Figure 8-13.) What plumb-bobbing shows is the
general slope of the green from your ball to the hole.
Remember that this method is about as exact as weather forecasting, but it
gives you a general idea.
Plumb-bobbing is not an exact science. But it is very cool. People who see
you plumb-bobbing will think that you know something they don’t. So, if
nothing else, fake plumb-bobbing. People will be impressed.
Dominant eye open, hold the
shaft up perpendicular to the
ground and in front of your face.
Where the hole is in relation
to the shaft indicates how
much a putt will bend.

Short Putts: Knee-Knockers
One of the greatest short putters of all time was former PGA champion Jackie
Burke, who went on to help PGA Tour star Steve Elkington with his game. I
was talking to Jackie one day about putting and asked how he developed his
knack for making short putts. His reply seemed astonishingly simple. All
Jackie did was analyze his game to identify his strengths and weaknesses. 
He concluded that his short game — his pitching and chipping — was where
he could pick up strokes on his competitors. (See Chapter 9 for information
about the short game.) Jackie knew that to score really well, he had to make 
a lot of putts in the 3- to 4-foot range. He thought that most of his chips and
pitches would finish 3 to 4 feet from the cup.
So every day, Jackie went to the practice putting green with 100 balls. He
stuck his putterhead in the cup and let the club fall to the green. Where the
butt end of the putter hit the ground, he put a ball. Then he went over to the
caddie shed and grabbed a caddie. Jackie handed the guy a $100 bill and told
him to sit behind the cup. Jackie then putted 100 balls from that distance. If
he made all 100, Jackie kept the money. If he missed even one, the caddie
pocketed the cash.
Jackie followed this routine every day. All of a sudden, every short putt 
he hit meant something. All short putts counted. And when he got to the golf
course and was faced with a short putt, he knew that he had already made
100 of them under a lot of pressure. (A $100 bill in those days was backed by
real gold.)
The word pressure is the key. You must create a situation in which missing
hurts. It doesn’t have to hurt you financially. Any kind of suffering is fine. But
you have to care about the result of every putt. If all you have to do after
missing is pull another ball over and try again, you’re never going to get
better. You don’t care enough.
So put yourself under pressure, even if you only make yourself stay on the
green until you can make 25 putts in a row. You’ll be amazed at how difficult
the last putt is after you’ve made 24 in a row. It’s the same putt in physical
terms. But you’re feeling nervous, knowing that missing means that you’ve
wasted your time over the previous 24 shots. In other words, you’ll have cre-
ated tournament conditions on the practice green. Now that’s pressure. Suck
some air.
Because you don’t want the ball to travel far, the stroke should be equally
short, which doesn’t give the putterhead much of an arc to swing on. But the
lack of arc is okay. On a short putt, you don’t want the putterhead to move
inside or outside the target line (at least on the way back). So think “straight
back, straight through.” If you can keep the putterface directly toward the
hole throughout the stroke and you’re set up squarely, you’re sure to make
more knee-knockers than you miss.
143
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

My instructions sound easy, but as with everything else in golf, knowing how
short putting feels helps. Place a two-by-four on the ground. Put the toe of
your putter against the board. Hit some putts, keeping the toe against the
board until after impact, as shown in Figure 8-14. Keep the putterhead at 90
degrees to the board so that the putter moves on the straight-back-and-
straight-through path that you want. Practice this drill until you can repeat
the sensation on real putts. And remember one of my Golf For Dummies
secrets: Never allow the wrist on your lead hand to bend when putting. If you
do, you’ll end up in putting hell.

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Long Putts: Lags
If short putts are a test of precision and technique, long putts are a test of
your feel for pace. Nothing more. The last thing I want you thinking about
over, say, a 40-foot putt is how far back to take the putter or what path the
putter will follow. Instead, focus on smoothness, rhythm, and timing — all 
the things that foster control over the distance a ball travels. Or, as Chevy
Chase said in the cult golf movie Caddyshack, “Be the ball.”
Here’s how I practice my long putting: First, I don’t aim for a hole. I’m think-
ing distance, not direction. I figure that hitting a putt 10 feet short is a lot
more likely than hitting it 10 feet wide, so distance is the key. I throw a bunch
of balls down on the practice green and putt to the far fringe (see Figure
8-15). I want to see how close I can get to the edge without going over. I don’t
care about where I hit the putt, just how far. If you practice like this, you’ll 
be amazed at how adept you become, to the point where you can predict at
impact just how far the ball will roll.
One basic rule for a beginning golfer is to match the length of your golf swing
to your putting stroke. That is, if you have a short swing (your left arm, if
you’re right-handed, doesn’t get too far up in the air on your backswing),
make sure that your putting stroke is a short one, too. If your full swing is
long, make sure that your putting stroke is long also. This way, you’re not
contradicting yourself.
To get a feel for distance, putt a few balls
to the far side of the practice putting green.
Figure 8-15:
Find the
pace.
145
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

Look at two of the greatest putters in the world today, Ben Crenshaw and Phil
Mickelson. Both have long, slow swings, and their putting strokes are — you
guessed it — long and slow. On the other hand, you have Nick Price and
Lanny Wadkins, who have quick swings and quick putting strokes. They all
keep a balance between golf swing and putting stroke.
Your swing tells a lot about your personality. If your golf swing is long and
slow, you’re probably an easygoing person. If your swing is short and fast,
you’re probably the type who walks around with his hair on fire.
I believe that a putting stroke that contradicts your full swing leads to prob-
lems. Sam Snead had a great long putting stroke that went with his beautiful
swing, but as the years came on the golf course, the swing stayed long and the
stroke got much shorter. The yips took over (see “Shh! Nobody Mentions . . .
the Yips,” later in this chapter). Johnny Miller had a big swing with his golf
clubs and a putting stroke that was so fast you could hardly see it. There was
a contradiction, and he had to go to the TV tower because he couldn’t roll ’em
in anymore. The change wasn’t all bad; Johnny brings great insight to the
game from his seat in the announcing booth.
So keep your two swings — the golf swing and the putting stroke — the same.
Keep your mind quiet and create no contradictions between the two swings.
Another exercise to foster your feel for distance is what I call the ladder drill.
Place a ball on the green about 10 feet from the green’s edge. From at least 30
feet away, try to putt another ball between the first ball and the fringe. Then
try to get a third ball between the second ball and the fringe and so on. See
how many balls you can putt before you run out of room or putting gets too
difficult. Obviously, the closer you get each ball to the preceding one, the
more successful you are.
Shh! Nobody Mentions . . . the Yips
“I’ve got the yips” might be the most feared phrase in golf. Any professional
golfer with the yips may as well be setting fire to dollar bills. Make that $100
bills. Simply put, yips is a nervous condition that prevents the afflicted from
making a smooth putting stroke. Instead, the yipper makes jerky little
snatches at the ball, the putterhead seemingly possessing a mind all its own.
Some of the best players in history have had their careers — at least at the
top level — cut short by the yips. Ben Hogan, perhaps the steeliest competi-
tor ever, was one such player. His great rival, Sam Snead, was another. Arnold
Palmer has a mild case of the yips. Bobby Jones, winner of the Grand Slam in
1930, had the yips. So did Tommy Armour, a brave man who lost an eye fight-
ing in the trenches during World War I and then later won a British Open and
a PGA Championship, but whose playing career was finished by his inability
to hole short putts. Peter Alliss, a commentator on ABC, found that he couldn’t
even move the putter away from the ball toward the end of his career.
146
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Two-time Masters winner Bernhard Langer has had the yips not once, not
twice, but three times. To Langer’s eternal credit, he has overcome them each
time, hence his rather unique, homemade style where he seems to be taking
his own pulse while over a putt.
Langer, who beat the yips and is still considered one of the best putters in
Europe, is the exception rather than the rule. As Henry Longhurst, the late,
great writer and commentator, said about the yips, “Once you’ve had ’em,
you’ve got ’em.”
Longhurst, himself a yipper, once wrote a highly entertaining column on the
yips, which opened with the following sentence: “There can be no more ludi-
crous sight than that of a grown man, a captain of industry, perhaps, and a
pillar of his own community, convulsively jerking a piece of ironmongery to
and fro in his efforts to hole a 3-foot putt.” Longhurst is right, too. Pray that
you don’t get the yips.
So what causes this involuntary muscle-twitching over short putts? Mostly, I
think it’s fear of missing. Fear of embarrassment. Fear of who knows what.
Whatever, it starts in the head. It can’t be physical. After all, we’re only talk-
ing about hitting the ball a short distance. What could be easier?
The yips spread insidiously through your body, like a virus. When the yips
reach your hands and arms, you’re doomed. Your only recourse is a complete
revamping of your method. Sam Snead started putting sidesaddle, facing the
hole, holding his putter with a sort of split-handed grip, the ball to the right
of his feet. Other players have tried placing the left hand below the right on
the putter. Langer invented his own grip and tried a long putter. The long
putter (described earlier in this chapter) has saved several players.
When Mac O’Grady did his study on the yips, he mailed 1,500 questionnaires
to golfers everywhere. When the doctors at UCLA’s Department of Neurology
looked over the results, they told us that the only way to “fool” the yips is to
stay ahead of them. When you do something long enough, like bending over to
putt a certain way, your body is in what the doctors call a length tension curve.
The brain recognizes this posture, and after you’ve missed putts for a long
period of time, the subconscious takes over and starts directing muscles to
help get the ball into the hole. Your conscious and subconscious are fighting,
and you’re going to lose. Without your knowing it, your right hand twitches, or
your left forearm has spasms trying to help you get the ball into the hole.
You’re in full focal dystonia (involuntary spasms) now, and that’s no fun.
The remedy the scientists suggested was changing the length tension curve,
or simply changing the way a yipper stands over a putt. The long putter
surely makes you stand up to the ball differently, and maybe that’s why
golfers almost always putt better immediately after trying a long putter.
147
Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

So if you get the yips, which usually come with age, simply change something
drastic in the way you set up the ball, make your grip totally different, or go
bowling.
The real key, however, is getting over the notion that using any of those meth-
ods immediately identifies you as a yipper, someone who is psychologically
impaired. That, to my mind, is socially harsh. Don’t be afraid to look different
if you get the yips. Do whatever works.
The Art of Aiming the Ball
The golf swing is an assortment of trajectories flung around in time and
space, with the golf club as the servant of the brain ill-equipped to do the
directing in spatial darkness. Manifestations of your binocular acuity are 
the key to your pilgrimage. Are you in alignment with the parallel universe
of focal obedience?
—Gary McCord, circa 1998, just after eating a lungfish tart
Golf is played with an assortment of physical skills and techniques. It is also
played with the mind, which makes the final decisions and tells your motor
system where and when things will happen, hopefully in some sort of har-
mony. It all starts with alignment.
Some golfers aim at a spot a few feet in front of the ball. When they place
their putters down behind the ball, they aim the face of the putter or the lines
on the putter at that spot. Aligning to a spot a foot or so in front of the ball is
easier than aligning to the hole, which may be much farther away.
Bowlers use this same kind of alignment strategy. If you’ve ever bowled, you
know about the spots that are a few feet in front of you on the lane. You look
at the spots and then pick a line to roll the ball over. After I discovered this
technique in my bowling league, the Gutter Dwellers, my average rocketed to
87. (Check out my bowling technique in Figure 8-16.)
You can use a couple of other strategies to help with alignment problems.
The first is to take the logo of the golf ball and set it along the line that you
want the putt to follow. This can help you get a better visual reference to the
line. Some players, like Tiger Woods, take a Sharpie pen and make a line
about an inch in length on the ball (see Figure 8-16). You can use this method
in the same way as the logo tip — to achieve a better visual reference for
directing the ball down the intended path. When you stand over the putt, the
ball is already aimed. That easy.
148
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

The eyes like lines
Players say that they putt better when they “see the line” of the putt. Some
days when I play, the line seems so visible that I can’t miss. Unfortunately,
this happens about once every presidential-election year. Most of the time, 
I have to concentrate to “see” the line.
Another set of lines that can help your optics are the lines of your feet, knees,
and shoulders. By keeping them square (at a right angle) to the target line,
you help your eyes appreciate what is straight — and this helps keep your
stroke on line.
Or make a line on the ball with a Sharpie pen.

Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock
Using the mind’s eye
I remember one telecast when I commented on
a putt that was caught on camera: “That putt
must have taken 11 seconds.” It was a long putt
that went over a hill and then down a severe
slope to the hole. The player had to perceive the
roll in order to hit it with the proper speed; he
had to visually rehearse the roll of the ball over
all that terrain until it looked like an instant
replay of the putt he was about to roll.

To help you keep the clubface square to your target line, use tape or a yard-
stick on the floor. Aim the tape at a distant target, like a baby grand piano at
the far end of your ballroom. Now set up at the end of the tape as if you were
going to hit an imaginary ball straight down the tape line. You’re practicing
visual alignment (which is a lot easier than practicing a 3-wood out of a fair-
way bunker with a large lip for three hours in a hailstorm). Give this drill a
chance — it can really help your perception of straight lines.
When I’m having problems aligning my clubface, I take some of the gum that
I’ve been chewing for the last three days and attach a tee to the putter with
the fat end flush to the face, as shown in Figure 8-17. Then I aim that tee at
the hole from about 3 feet away. (It’s amazing how strong gum is after a three-
day chew; in fact, I used it as mortar on my new brick mobile home.)
Your job is to stand there and visually process what a square clubface looks
like as you look down the attached tee to the hole. Spend a couple of minutes
appreciating this perspective. If it looks okay to you on your first try, you’re
in line for your Bachelor of Alignment degree. If not, repeat this drill daily
until it looks okay the first time you place the club down. Use this drill to edu-
cate your eyes to a straight-line perspective and a square clubface.

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Speed kills
Almost every putt is what I call a “depth charge launch.” That means that it
should have the speed to lurk around the hole and just maybe hit the hole
and fall in. If you get it close, you might perform a burial with your ball. One
of the best ways to develop a touch for the speed at which a putt should roll
is to imagine things happening before they really do.
You must optically preview the putt’s roll from its stationary point to a rest-
ing place near the hole — a tap-in is really nice. This optical preview acti-
vates the motor system to respond with the right amount of energy to hit the
putt. You’d do the same thing if I told you to throw a ball over a bush and
make it land no more than 5 feet beyond the bush. You’d decide at what arc
and speed to toss the ball, and your mind’s eye would relay this information
to your muscles.
View a putt from a point off to the side of the target line, midway between 
the ball and the hole, as shown in Figure 8-18. This technique can give you a
better feel for the distance. Some professionals swear that they can visualize
the proper speed of a putt twice as well from the side.
A good rule of thumb: Don’t change your mind about your strategy while
you’re over a putt. For one thing, putts look different from above than from
the side! For another, the ground you stand on may not be sloped the same as
it is near the hole. And unless the putt is all downhill, the ball will do most of
its curving during the last third of the putt. (That’s another reason to stand
to the side of the putt — assessing the last third of the putt is easier from
there.)

Chapter 8: Putting: The Art of Rolling the Rock

Some quick tips you may want to write down in your reminder book:
 Fast greens break more, so don’t hit the ball too hard. But keep in
mind that hitting the ball softly means that the slope will affect it more.
 Downhill putts act like fast greens, because the slope affects the roll of
the ball for more than the last few feet.
 Slow greens break less, so you have to hit the ball harder. That initial
burst of speed will keep the ball from breaking as much.
 Uphill putts act like slow greens. Your challenge is to figure out how
much uphill slope you’re dealing with, and then adjust your putt accord-
ingly — the steeper the slope, the more power it takes. Imagining the
hole’s being farther away than it really is can help.
Points of the roll
I give you information on some complicated stuff, so here are some key
points:
 Keep your alignment parallel to the target line. All the following parts
of you stay parallel to that line:
• Feet
• Knees
• Shoulders
• Eye line
 Know what your putter blade looks like when it’s square to the line.
 Use the ball’s logo or a line you’ve marked on the ball to help you
align putts.
 Follow the line of your intended putt with your eyes at the speed that
you think the ball will roll.
 Stare at the line of your putt longer than you look at the golf ball.
To putt well, you have to train yourself. Putting takes practice. The boys at
the club practice putting less than anything else, but more than half the
strokes you play in this silly game may be putts. Create some games on the
putting green to enhance your desire to go there and practice. Your score
card will thank you.

Chipping and Pitching
In This Chapter
 Understanding the short game
 Noting the importance of the short game
 Chipping your way to success
 Pitching yourself out of tight spots
F
ive-time PGA champion Walter Hagen had the right approach. He stood on
the first tee knowing that he’d probably hit at least six terrible shots that
day. So when he did hit terrible shots, he didn’t get upset. Hagen simply relied
on his superior short game (every shot within 80 yards of the hole) to get him
out of trouble. That combination of attitude and dexterity made him a feared
match player. His apparent nonchalance — “Always take time to smell the flow-
ers,” he used to say — and his ability to get up and down “from the garbage”
put a lot of pressure on his opponents. Opponents became depressed or
annoyed and eventually downhearted. More often than not, Hagen won his
matches without having hit his full shots too solidly. He proved that golf is
more than hitting the ball well — golf is a game of managing your misses.
Golf Has Its Ups and Downs
As I mention earlier, the short game is every shot hit within 80 yards of the
hole. That includes sand play (Chapter 10) and putting (Chapter 8). So what’s
left? Chipping and pitching — two versions of short shots to the green. The
chip is a low shot, while the pitch is a higher flier.
Hang around golfers for only a short while, and you inevitably hear one say
something like, “I missed the third green to the right but got up and down for
my par.” At this stage, you’re probably wondering what in the world “up and
down” means. Well, the “up” part is the subject of this chapter — chipping or
pitching the ball to the hole. The “down” half of the equation, of course, is

holing the putt after your chip or pitch (see Chapter 8). Thus, a golfer with a
good short game is one who gets “up and down” a high percentage of the
time (anywhere above 50 percent).
Now here’s the weird thing: Although a good short game can erase your mis-
takes and keep a good round going, many amateurs tend to look down on
golfers blessed with a delicate touch around the greens. They hate to lose to
someone who beats them with good chipping and putting. Somehow a strong
short game isn’t perceived as “macho golf” — at least not in the same way as
smashing drives 300 yards and hitting low, raking, iron shots to greens is
macho. Good ball strikers tend to look down on players with better short
games. This attitude is more than a snobbery thing — it’s also a missing-the-
point thing.
In golf, you want to move the ball around the course while achieving the
lowest score you can. How you get that job done is up to you. No rule says
that you have to look pretty when you play golf. Your round isn’t going to be
hung in an art gallery. As someone once said, “Three of them and one of
those makes four.” Remember that saying. You can make up for a lot of bad
play with one good putt.
You don’t hear professionals downplaying the importance of a good short
game. We know that the short game is where we make our money. Here’s
proof: If you put a scratch (zero-handicap) amateur and a tournament pro on
the tee with drivers in their hands, the two shots don’t look that much differ-
ent. Sure, you can tell who is the better player, but the amateur at least looks
competitive.
The gap in quality grows on the approach shots, again on wedge play, and
then again on the short game. In fact, the closer the players get to the green,
the more obvious the difference in level of play. And the green is where a
mediocre score gets turned into a good score and where a good score gets
turned into a great score. (Take a look at the sample score card in Figure 9-1.
It wouldn’t hurt to keep that kind of record for yourself once in a while.)
Okay, I’ve convinced you of the importance of the short game in the overall
scheme of things. Before you go further, you need to know the difference
between a chip and a pitch. In the United States, this question is easy to
answer. A chip is a short shot that’s mostly on the ground. A pitch, in con-
trast, is generally a longer shot that’s mostly in the air.
154
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Chips Ahoy!
Chips are short shots played around the greens with anything from a 5-iron to
a sand wedge. The basic idea is to get the ball on the green and rolling as
soon as you can. If you get the ball running like a putt, you’ll have an easier
time judging how far it will go.

Chapter 9: Chipping and Pitching

Pick your spot
Your first point of reference is the spot where you want the ball to land. If at
all possible, you want that spot to be on the putting surface. The turf there is
generally flatter and better prepared, which makes the all-important first
bounce more predictable. You want to avoid landing chips on rough, uneven,
or sloping ground.
Pick a spot about 2 feet onto the green (see Figure 9-2). From that spot, I like to
visualize the ball running along the ground toward the hole. Visualization is a
big part of chipping. Try to see the shot in your mind’s eye before you hit the
ball. Then be as exact as you can with your target. You can’t be too precise.
Figure 9-2:
Pick your
spot.
156
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Choose the right club
Your choice of club depends on the amount of room you have between your
landing point and the hole. If you only have 15 feet, you need a more lofted
club (one with a face that is severely angled back from vertical), like a sand
wedge, so that the ball doesn’t run too far.
If you’ve ever watched golf on TV, you’ve probably seen Phil Mickelson or Tiger
Woods use a full swing to hit the ball straight up in the air and cover only a
short distance on the ground. Phil can do another thing that’s really astound-
ing: You stand about 6 feet away from Phil and turn your back to him. You then
cup your hands and hold them straight out from your chest. Phil takes a full
swing with his sand wedge and lofts the ball over your head and into your
sweaty, waiting hands — all from only 6 feet away. Now that’s a lob wedge!
If that gap is bigger — say, 60 feet — then a straighter-faced club, like a 7-iron,
is more practical. Figure 9-3 illustrates this concept.

Lies and instinct
Then you have the problem of how the ball is lying on the ground. When the
ball is in longer grass, you need to use a more lofted club and make a longer
swing, no matter where the hole is. (Remember: Longer grass means a longer
swing.) You need to get the ball high enough to escape the longer rough. If
the ball is lying “down” in a depression and you can’t get the ball out with the
straight-faced club, which the situation normally calls for, you have to go to
more loft and move the ball back a little in your stance — closer to your right
foot — to make the shot work (see Chapter 12 for more on low shots). So this
part of the game does require flexibility.
Use the philosophy that I’ve outlined as a starting point, not as holy writ that
must be followed to the letter. Let your own creativity take over. Go with your
instincts when you need to choose the right club or shot. The more you prac-
tice this part of your game, the better your instincts become.
Practice, and only practice, makes you better. Try all sorts of clubs for these
shots. Sooner or later, you’ll develop a feel for the short game. I stress that
you should use as many clubs as possible when practicing. Using different
clubs helps you work on the technique and not just a particular shot.
Now hit that chip
Short game guru Phil Rodgers taught me my chipping technique, which is
basically the same one that I employ for putting. I use a putting stroke, but
with a lofted club — and I want you to do the same. Take your putting grip
and stroke, and go hit chip shots.
The key to chipping is the setup. Creating the right positions at address is
essential.
You want your stance to be narrow, about 12 inches from heel to heel, and
open — pull your left foot back from the target line. Your shoulders should be
open to the target as well. Now place about 80 percent of your weight on your
left side. By moving your hands ahead of the ball, you encourage the down-
ward strike that you need to make solid contact with the ball. Place the ball on
a line about 2 inches to the left of your right big toe, as shown in Figure 9-4.
During your stroke, focus on the back of your left wrist. Your left wrist must
stay flat and firm, as in putting (see Figure 9-5). To keep your wrist flat, tape a
Popsicle stick to the back of that wrist (slipping the stick under your watch-
band works almost as well). You’ll feel any breakdowns right away. Now go
hit some putts and chips.

Chapter 9: Chipping and Pitching

When I play a tour event, one of the first things I do is go to the putting green,
where I hit putts and chips to get an idea of the speed of the greens. I find a
flat spot on the green and drop some golf balls about 5 feet off the putting
surface. Then I put a coin on the green 2 feet from the fringe (the collar of
grass around the green — it’s longer than the grass on the green but shorter
than the grass on the fairway). Then I take an 8-iron, 9-iron, and wedge to my
spot off the green and chip balls onto the green, trying to bounce each ball
off the coin and letting it then run to the hole. I get a really good idea of how
fast the greens are that week. You can also develop a touch for those shots —
and when you miss as many greens as I do, the practice comes in handy.
Make Your Pitch
Pitch shots, which you play with only your wedges and 9-iron, are generally
longer than chip shots, so, as you’d expect, you need to make a longer swing.
That introduces wrist action into the equation, which introduces the problem
of how long your swing should be and how fast. In other words, pitch shots
need some serious feel.
Put a pen inside
your watchband.
That‘ll firm up
your wrist.

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Even the best players try to avoid pitch shots. They’re “in-between” shots.
You can’t just make your normal, everyday, full swing — that would send the
ball way too far. You’re stuck making a half-type swing — which is never easy,
especially when you’re under pressure.
Anyway, here’s how to build your pitching swing.
First, adopt the same stance that you did for the chip shot: same width, same
posture, same ball position. The only difference is in the alignment of your
shoulders, which should be parallel to your toe line and open to the target
line, as shown in Figure 9-6.
Now make a miniswing (which I describe in Chapter 6). Without moving the
butt end of the club too far in your backswing, hinge your wrists so that the
shaft is horizontal. Then swing through the shot. Watch how far the ball goes.
That distance is your point of reference. Do you want to hit the next pitch 10
yards farther? Make your swing a little longer (see Figure 9-7). Shorter? Your
swing follows suit. That way, your rhythm never changes. You want the club-
head accelerating smoothly through the ball. And that acceleration is best
achieved if the momentum is built up gradually from address.
When you pitch, your shoulders and
feet must be aligned to the left of
where you want the ball to go.

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Poor pitchers of the ball do one of two things: Either they start their swings
way too slowly and then speed up too much at impact, or they jerk the club
away from the ball and have to decelerate later. Both swings lead to what golf
columnist Peter Dobereiner christened “sickening knee-high fizzers” — low,
thin shots that hurtle uncontrollably over the green, or complete duffs that
travel only a few feet. Not a pretty sight. The most common cause of both is
tension. So relax.
Imagine that you’re swinging with a potato chip between your teeth. Focus on
not biting down on it. That’ll keep you relaxed.
Here’s a game we play at the back of the range at our facility at Grayhawk
Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona. We get five empty buckets and place them in
a straight line at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 feet. We then have one hour to hit one
ball into each bucket, starting at 20 feet. The winner gets the title to the other
guy’s car. We’re still driving our own cars — we usually get frustrated and
quit before the one-hour time limit expires, or we go to lunch. But at least we
get some good pitching practice.
In golf, you get better by doing; you don’t get better by doing nothing.
Last pitching thought: Although pitch shots fly higher than chips, apply the
same philosophy to your pitching: Get the ball back to the ground as soon as
possible. Pick out your landing area and let the ball roll. See the shot in your
mind’s eye before you hit the ball, and remember your Golf For Dummies
secret: Hit down — don’t try to lift the ball.

It’s Your Sandbox: Bunker Play
In This Chapter
 What is a bunker?
 Understanding sand play
 Achieving a sound bunker technique
 Dealing with a less-than-perfect lie
I
have read countless articles and books on sand play, and they all say the
same thing: Because you don’t even have to hit the ball, playing from the
sand is the easiest part of golf. Bull trap! If sand play were the easiest aspect
of the game, all those articles and books would never be written in the first
place. Everyone would be blasting the ball onto the putting surface with nary
a care in the world. And that, take it from me, is certainly not the case.
In this chapter, I explain the equipment and techniques you need to get out of
the sand. I tell how and why your sand wedge is different from any other club
in your bag. At the end of the chapter, I even tell how you can hit a successful
bunker shot from a terrible lie. Do that your next time out and your friends
will be amazed.
Bunkers: Don’t Call ’Em Sand Traps!
Bunkers, or sand traps (as I’m told not to call them on TV), provoke an extra-
ordinary amount of “sand angst” among golfers. But sometimes, aiming for a
bunker actually makes sense — on a long, difficult approach shot, for exam-
ple. The pros know that the “up and down” from sand can actually be easier
than from the surrounding (usually long and thick) grass.
Bunkers began life as dips in the ground on the windswept Scottish linksland.
Because such areas were sheltered from cold breezes, sheep would take
refuge in them. Thus, the dips expanded and got deeper. When the land came
to be used for golf, the locals took advantage of what God and the sheep left
behind and fashioned sand-filled bunkers. (No word on what the sheep
thought of all this.)

On these old courses, the greens were sited so as to maximize the bunkers’
threat to golfers’ shots, which is why they came to be named hazards in the
rules of golf. Later, course architects placed these insidious “traps” so as to
penalize wayward shots. That’s why you generally don’t see bunkers in the
middle of fairways — they’re mostly to the sides.
As to how much sand you find in a typical bunker, that varies. I prefer a depth
of about 2 inches. That stops balls from burying too much on landing but still
provides a decent cushion for the escape shot.
I don’t know too many amateurs who have ever aimed at a bunker. Mired in a
bunker is the last place they want to be. Typifying the way in which amateur
golfers look at bunkers is the experience the late Tip O’Neill had years ago
during the first few days of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, a pro-am tourna-
ment. The former Speaker of the House, admittedly not the strongest golfer
(even among celebrities), found himself in a very deep bunker. He then spent
the next few hours (okay, it just seemed that long) trying to extricate first the
ball, and then himself, from the trap — all on national television. You could
almost hear millions of viewers saying to themselves, “Yeah, been there, done
that.”
Why is it that most amateurs are scared to death every time their shots end up
in a greenside bunker? Just what is it about sand play that they find so tough?
Well, after much research, some of it in a laboratory, I’ve come to the conclu-
sion the problem is simple. (If it weren’t simple, I would never have discovered
it.) It all comes down to lack of technique and/or a lack of understanding.
166
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 
Sorry, sand man
Getting the ball out of a bunker can be easy if
you practice enough and get a feel for it. I knew
at an early age that my scoring depended on
getting up and down out of bunkers with a cer-
tain regularity, so I practiced bunker shots with
a vengeance. As a result, I can get a ball out of
a bunker with everything from a sand wedge to
a putter.
One day I was playing in the Kemper Open in
Charlotte, North Carolina, when I saw a notori-
ously bad bunker player who was on the tour
practicing hard on his sand play. After a few
moments of idle conversation and general
harassing, a bet transpired. He would hit ten
balls with his sand wedge; I would hit five balls
with a putter. If I got my ball closer than his ball,
he would have to go in the locker room and
announce to everyone that I beat him with a
putter out of a bunker. If he won, I would take
him to dinner and then not bother him for the
rest of the year.
The laughter from the locker room echoed
throughout the clubhouse, and his reputation as
the worst bunker player on tour remained intact.
I cannot divulge his name because he is playing
the senior tour now and is doing very well. He
got much better getting out of the sand after
some much-needed practice.

Faced with a bunker shot, many golfers are beaten before they start. You can
tell by their constipated looks, sweaty foreheads, and hesitant body language.
Their reaction when they fail is also interesting. After a couple of shots finish
up back in the bunker, most people don’t focus on their technique. They
merely try to hit the shot harder, making more and more violent swings. Not
good. Hitting the ball harder only makes them angrier, and then the ball sure
isn’t going to come out. Still, they dig a nice big hole, which is perfect if they
want to bury a small pet but not much good for anything else.
Part of the reason for this all-too-human reaction is that long stretches of fail-
ure resign you to your fate. In your mind, you’ve tried everything, and you
still can’t get the damn thing out. So you trudge into the bunker expecting the
worst, and you usually get it.
The Problem with Sand Play
A huge majority of golfers address the ball in a way that makes it all but
impossible to create the correct angles in their golf swings. Golf, and espe-
cially bunker play, is only the creation of the proper angle that the clubhead
must take into the ball. (The clubhead is the part that, when you hold the
club in front of your face, hangs below the leading edge.) Sometimes, the root
of the duffs, hacks, slashes, and any other sort of poor shot is ball position. If
you have the ball positioned way back toward your right foot, as so many
people seem to do, you won’t ever get the ball out of the trap. You can’t hit
the ball high enough, for one thing. For another, the clubhead enters the sand
at too steep an angle. In other words, the clubhead digs into the sand instead
of sliding through it. When that happens, the ball usually stays in the bunker,
sucking sand.
Poor bunker players suffer from a lack of understanding. They get into the
sand and start “digging” as if they’re having a day out at a quarantined beach.
Sometimes I feel like throwing poor bunker players a bucket and shovel so
that they can dig for clams. Then at least they’d have something to show for
all their efforts.
To Be — Or Not to Be — 
Handy from Sand
To be a competent sand player, you must take advantage of the way your
sand wedge is designed. The bottom of the club is wider than the top (see
Figure 10-1). The bounce is the bottom of the clubhead. Believe me, if you can
make the best use of the bounce, bunker play will be off your endangered-
species list.
167
Chapter 10: It’s Your Sandbox: Bunker Play

The bounce is the part of the clubhead that should contact the sand first.
This encourages the sliding motion that’s so crucial to good bunker play.
Think about it: The sand is going to slow the club as you swing down and
through, which is okay. But you want to keep the slowdown to a minimum. If
the club digs in too much, the ball probably won’t get out of the bunker. So
slide the clubhead; don’t use it to dig. Take note, however, that not every
sand wedge has the same amount of bounce. The width of the sole and the
amount that it hangs below the leading edge varies. This, of course, begs
another question: How do you know how much bounce your sand wedge
needs? The determining factor is the type of sand you play from. The bigger
the bounce or the wider the sole on your sand wedge, the less it will dig into
the sand.
If the sand at your home club is typically pretty firm underfoot, you need a
sand wedge with very little bounce. A club with a lot of bounce does just 
that — bounce. And hard (or wet) sand only accentuates that tendency. So
using that club is only going to see you hitting a lot of shots thin, the club-
head skidding off the sand and contacting the ball’s equator. Either you hit
the ball into the face of the bunker and don’t get out at all, or the ball misses
the face and finishes way over the green. Neither result is socially acceptable.
At the other end of the scale is really soft, deep sand. For that sort of stuff,
you need a lot of bounce. In fact, because the clubhead digs so easily when
the sand is soft, you can’t have enough bounce.
But enough of this preamble. Take a look at how a sound sand technique is
properly — and easily — achieved.
The width of the
flange varies.

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

The Splash
Okay, you’re in a greenside bunker. You want to get the ball out and onto the
putting surface. Here’s what to do: Open your stance by pulling your left foot
back. Pull your foot back until you start to feel vaguely ridiculous. Your left
foot’s position must feel funny to you. If it doesn’t, pull your foot back more.
Next, open (turn to the right) your sand wedge to the point where the face is
almost looking straight up at the sky, as shown in Figure 10-2. The ball should
be positioned forward in your stance toward your left heel. (Do this even
more if you’re unlucky enough to be very close to the face of the bunker.) You
should feel like you’ll go right under the ball when you swing at it. This posi-
tion should feel just as weird as your stance. Again, if it doesn’t, turn your
sand wedge to the right even more.
169
Chapter 10: It’s Your Sandbox: Bunker Play
“Hoe-ly cow!”
Once, while in Vail, Colorado, I received an
urgent phone call from director Ron Shelton
while he was shooting the movie Tin Cup. He
said, “Gary, we forgot to ask you this, but how
do you hit a gardening hoe out of a bunker?”
“Gee, Ron,” I said, “I haven’t done that in a
while; let me think. What do you mean, how do
you hit a gardening hoe out of a bunker?!!” Ron
told me that a scene had to be shot the next day
with Kevin Costner hitting a ball out of a bunker,
with a hoe, and that the ball had to land no more
than 3 feet from the hole. Sure. Right.
I went to the practice green at Singletree Golf
Course with my shag bag full of balls and a hoe.
It was pouring down rain. It took me 40 minutes
to get a single ball out of the bunker, and I
bladed (hit the center of the ball with the lead-
ing edge) that one to get it out. I finally decided
that the bottom edge of the hoe was too sharp
and I needed some bounce to make it perform
better in the sand. So I bent the hoe on the
bottom and immediately started to get the ball
up and out.
I called the movie set and gave directions on the
technique of how to bend the hoe. They shot the
scene, and Kevin Costner hit the first ball out of
the bunker, with the hoe, 2 feet from the hole.
That’s a take; wrap it up, as they say.
So if the bounce can work to get a ball out of a
bunker with a hoe, think what it can do for your
sand wedge.

Most amateurs I play with don’t do either of those things. They stand too
square and don’t open the clubface nearly enough. In effect, they don’t take
advantage of their sand wedges. This club is most efficient when the face is
wide open (turned clockwise). Sand wedges are designed that way. The open
face sends the ball up when you hit the sand.
Your hands should be ìbehi nd” the ball.
Turn the clubface clockwise until it looks skyward.
At address, pull your left foot back.
Figure 10-2:

stance until

Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Here’s one other thing that you should know. When I go home to play, I notice
that nobody practices bunker shots, not even my pal Sand Wedge Sam. (He
got his nickname after demonstrating uncommon prowess in the much
underestimated and neglected art of sand-wedge tossing.) Don’t fall into that
trap (I love bad puns); get into a bunker and practice. Besides, you never
know, you may like bunkers.
Finally, remember that your club must not touch the sand before you hit the
ball. That’s grounding the club — illegal in a hazard.
Okay, you’re over the shot, now what? You want to know where to hit the
sand, right?
Aim about a credit-card length behind the ball. Swing at about 80 percent of
full speed. Think of it as a sliding motion. Don’t hit down. Let the clubhead
throw a “scoop” of sand onto the green, as shown in Figure 10-3. Focusing on
a full, uninhibited follow-through will help (see Figure 10-4). Forget the ball —
all you’re trying to do is throw sand out of the bunker. (The more sand you
throw, the shorter the shot will be. So if you need to hit the shot a fair dis-
tance, hit maybe only 2 inches behind the ball.) If you can throw sand, the
ball will be carried along for the ride. And that’s why better players say that
bunker play is easy — the clubhead never actually contacts the ball. Now go
get some sunblock and spend some time practicing in the sand.
Try to slide the clubhead under the ball…
throwing some sand and
the ball onto the green.

Chapter 10: It’s Your Sandbox: Bunker Play

Buried Alive!
Unfortunately, not every lie (where the ball is sitting) in a bunker is perfect.
Sometimes the ball plugs (embeds itself in the sand so that only part of it is
visible). You’ll hear other golfers call this sort of lie a fried egg. When that
happens to your ball, and after you’re through cursing your bad luck, you
need to employ a different technique.
Or at least a different alignment of the clubface. You still need your open
stance, but this time don’t open the clubface. Keep it a little hooded. In other
words, align the clubface to the left of your ultimate target. Now, shift nearly
all your weight to your left side, which puts you “ahead” of the shot (see
Figure 10-5). And play the ball back in your stance. This is the one time you
want the leading edge of the club to dig. The ball, after all, is below the 
surface.
Make a full follow-through. Recock
your wrist right after impact.
Figure 10-4:
Keep going!
172
Part II: You Ain’t Got a Thing If You Ain’t Got That Swing 

Okay, you’re ready. Swing the club up and down, and I mean up and down like
you’re chopping wood with a dull ax. Hit straight down on the sand a couple
of inches behind the ball (see Figure 10-6). A follow-through isn’t needed. Just
hit down. Hard. The ball should pop up and then run to the hole. With little
or no backspin, the ball will run like it just stole something. So allow for extra
roll.
Put the ball back in your stance…
but don‘t change your posture.
Close the clubface
at address.

dig it?
173
Chapter 10: It’s Your Sandbox: Bunker Play

Just how hard you should hit down is hard for me to say — it depends on the
texture and depth of the sand and on how deep the ball is buried. That old
standby, practice, tells you what you need to know.
Second-to-last point: Practice with clubs of various lofts, and then use what-
ever works. Many times I use my pitching wedge (which has little bounce and
a sharper leading edge and, therefore, digs more) with this technique.
Last point: Always smooth out your footprints when leaving a bunker. If there’s
no rake lying nearby, use your feet. Or if you’re like my buddy Steamroller Ron,
just roll around in the bunker until it’s real smooth. Golfers used to gather to
watch Ron smooth out the sand. We had very few rakes at the muni, and the
Steamroller was the nearest thing we had to one. I miss Steamroller; he sold his
gravel business and moved to Saudi Arabia.
“Bury” the club in the sand…
which shortens your follow-through.

I
f you’re like everyone else who has ever played the game, golf is a constant
battle against annoying faults in your full swing or putting stroke. Even the
best golfers have some little hitch in their methods that they have to watch
for, especially under pressure. Greg Norman once had a tendency to hit the
ball well to the right of the target on the closing holes of big tournaments. Phil
Mickelson and Tiger Woods went through periods when they drove the ball
crooked at the wrong times. Watch your playing companions when they get a
little nervous; you can see all sorts of unfortunate events. Putts are left short.
Even simple shots take longer to play. Conversation all but stops. And best of
all, from your point of view, any faults in their swings are cruelly exposed.
You’re going to develop faults in your swing and game. Faults are a given, no
matter how far you progress. The trick is catching your faults before they
spoil your outlook on your game. Faults left unattended often turn into major
problems and ruin your game.
The root cause of most faults is your head position. Your cranium’s position
relative to the ball as you strike it dictates where the bottom of your swing is.
The bottom of your swing is always a spot on the ground relative to where
your head is positioned. Test that assertion. Shift your weight and your head
toward the target onto your left side. Leave the ball in its regular position.
Now make your normal swing with, say, a 6-iron. The divot made by the club
will be more in front of the ball. The bottom of your swing moves toward the
target along with your head.

The opposite is also true. Shift your weight and head to the right, and the
bottom of your swing moves in the same direction.
The bottom line: If your head moves too much during the swing, you have
little chance to correct things before impact, and the result is usually some
form of poor shot.
Don’t get the idea that excessive head movement is responsible for
absolutely every bad shot. Other poor plays can stem from improper use of
your hands, arms, or body. But try to keep your head as steady as possible.
Anyway, that’s the big picture. Now I’ll get more specific. What follows is a
discussion of the most common faults you are likely to develop, with cures
for each fault. After you know what your tendencies are, you can refer to this
chapter regularly to work on fixing them.
Skying Your Tee Shots: The Fountain Ball
One of the most common sights I see on the first tee of a pro-am or member-
guest tournament is the skyed tee shot — the ball goes higher than it goes
forward. It’s usually hit on the top part of the driver, causing an ugly mark to
appear, which is one reason why a tour player never lets an amateur use his
driver. If the amateur hits a fountain ball (as my wife likes to call it, because
she says that a skyed tee shot has the same trajectory as one of those foun-
tains in Italy), he’ll have a lot of apologizing to do.
At the municipal course where I nurtured my game, we had few rules, but one
of them was that if you could catch your drive off the tee, you could play it
over again with no penalty. We had so many guys wearing tennis shoes for
speed that it looked like a track meet.
If you’re hitting the ball on the top side of your driver, you’re swinging the
club on too much of a downward arc. What’s that mean, you ask? It means
that your head is too far in front of the ball (toward the target side of the ball)
and your left shoulder is too low at impact — bad news for your driver.
Here’s what to do:
1. Go find an upslope.
2. Stand so that your left foot (if you’re right-handed) is higher than your
right.
3. Tee the ball up and hit drivers or 3-woods until you get the feeling of
staying back and under the shot.
The uphill lie promotes this feeling.
178
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

I’ll tell you a secret about this teaching trick: People who hit down on their
drivers want to kill the stupid ball in front of their buddies. These golfers
have a tremendous shift of their weight to the left side on the downswing. If
you hit balls from an upslope, you can’t get your weight to the left side as
quickly. Consequently, you keep your head behind the ball, and your left
shoulder goes up at impact. Practice on an upslope until you get a feel and
then proceed to level ground. The next time I see you in the sky, it will be on
Delta Airlines.
Slicing and Hooking
Most golfers slice, which means that the ball starts to the left of the target
and finishes well to the right. I think slicing stems from the fact that most
players tend to aim to the right of their target. When they do so, their swings
have to compensate so that the resulting shots can finish close to the target.
In most cases, that compensation starts when your brain realizes that if you
swing along your aim, the ball will fly way to the right. The resulting flurry of
arms and legs isn’t pretty — and invariably, neither is the shot. Soon this
weak, left-to-right ball flight makes your life a slicing hell. Slices don’t go very
far. They’re horrible, weak shots that affect your DNA for generations to come.
In general, slicers use too much body action and not enough hand action in
their swings. Golfers who hook have the opposite tendency — too much
hand action, not enough body.
Fear not, hapless hackers: Two variations of the same drill offer solutions.
If you’re a slicer, you need to get your hands working in the swing. Here’s how:
1. Address a ball as you normally do.
2. Turn your whole body until your butt is toward the target and your
feet are perpendicular to the target line.
3. Twist your upper body to the left so that you can again place the club-
head behind the ball.
Don’t move your feet, however. From this position, you have, in effect,
made it impossible for your body to turn to your left on the through-
swing (see Figure 11-1).
Try it. Should I call a chiropractor yet? The only way you can swing the
club through the ball is by using your hands and arms.

Chapter 11: Typical Problems and Simple Solutions

4. Hit a few balls.
Focus on letting the toe of the clubhead pass your heel through impact.
Quite a change in your ball flight, eh? Because your hands and arms are
doing so much of the rotating work in your new swing, the clubhead is
doing the same. The clubhead is now closing as it swings through the
impact area. The spin imparted on the ball now causes a slight right-to-
left flight — something I bet you thought you’d never see.
After you’ve hit about 20 shots by using this drill, switch to your normal
stance and try to reproduce the feel you had standing in that strange but cor-
rect way. You’ll soon be hitting hard, raking draws (slight hooks) far up the
fairway.
Golfers prone to hooks (shots that start right and finish left) have the oppo-
site problem — too much hand action and not enough body. Here’s a drill if
you tend to hook the ball:
If you slice, try this drill:
Stand with your back to
the target. Then turn your
whole body until your butt
is to the target and twist
your upper body to
address the ball.

right to left.

1. Adopt your regular stance.
2. Turn your whole body until you’re looking directly at the target.
3. Twist your upper body to the right — don’t move your feet — until
you can set the clubhead behind the ball (see Figure 11-2).
4. Hit some shots.
You’ll find solid contact easiest to achieve when you turn your body
hard to the left, which prevents your hands from becoming overactive.
Your ball flight will soon be a gentle fade (slight slice).
After about 20 shots, hit some balls from your normal stance, practicing the

Topping the Ball
Topping isn’t much fun. Plus, it’s a lot of effort for very little return. Topping
is when you make a full-blooded, nostrils-flaring swipe at the ball, only to tick
the top and send the ball a few feeble yards.
Topping occurs because your head is moving up and down during your
swing. A rising head during your downswing pulls your shoulders, arms,
hands, and the clubhead up with it. Whoops!
To whip topping, you have to keep your head from lifting. And the best way
to do that is to establish a reference for your eyes before you start the club
back. Stick an umbrella in the ground just beyond the golf ball, as shown in
Figure 11-3. Focus your eyes on the umbrella throughout your swing. As long
as you stay focused on the umbrella, your head and upper torso cannot lift,
which ends topped shots.
Duffing and Thinning Chip Shots
Duffing and thinning are exact opposites, yet, like the slice and the hook, they
have their roots in the same fault (see Figure 11-4).
Focus on the umbrella while you swing.

Chapter 11: Typical Problems and Simple Solutions

When you duff a chip (also called a chili-dip, or, as I like to say, Hormel), your
swing is bottoming out behind the ball. You’re hitting too much ground and
not enough ball (also called hitting it fat), which means that the shot falls
painfully short of the target and your playing partners laugh outrageously.
Duffing a chip is the one shot in golf that can get you so mad that you can’t
spell your mother’s name.
One shot that is rare to actually witness is the double chip, where you hit the
chip fat, causing the clubhead to hit the ball twice — once while it’s in the air.
You could never do this if you tried, but sometime, somewhere, you’ll see it
performed and will stand in amazement.
I was playing a tournament in Palm Springs, California, when one of the ama-
teurs, standing near the condos surrounding the course, hit a chip shot. He
had to loft the ball gently over a bunker and then have it land on the green like
a Nerf ball on a mattress. He hit the shot a little fat, the ball went up in the air
slowly, and his club accelerated and hit the ball again about eye level. The ball
went over his head, out of bounds, and into the swimming pool. The rule says
that you may have only four penalty strokes per swing maximum, but I think
he beat that by a bunch with that double-hit chip shot. When I saw him last,
he was still trying to retrieve his ball with the homeowner’s pool net.
Thinned chips (skulls, as they call it on tour, or Vin Scullys, as I call them, after
the famous Dodgers baseball announcer) are the opposite of the Hormels
(duffs). You aren’t hitting enough ground. In fact, you don’t hit the ground at
all. The club strikes the ball above the equator, sending the shot speeding on
its merry way, past the hole into all sorts of evil places. You need to hit the
ground slightly so that the ball hits the clubface and not the front end of the
club.
Again, start by sticking your club shaft in the ground beyond the ball.
If you continually hit Hormels (duffs), get your nose to the left of the shaft,
which moves the bottom of your swing forward. Doing so allows you to hit
down on the ball from the right position. Make sure that your head stays for-
ward in this shot. Most people who hit an occasional Hormel move their
heads backward as they start their downswings, which means that they hit
behind the ball.
If you’re prone to hit an occasional Vin Scully (a thin shot), set up with your
nose behind or to the right of the ball, which moves the bottom of your swing
back. When you find the right spot, you’ll hit the ball and the ground at the
same time, which is good. I’ve found that most people who hit their shots
thin have a tendency to raise their entire bodies up immediately before
impact. Concentrate on keeping your upper torso bent the same way
throughout the swing. Hopefully, the next time you hear the name Vin Scully,
it’ll be on TV.

Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

Can’t Make a Putt?
Some people argue that putting is more mental than physical. But before you
resort to séances with your local fortuneteller, check your alignment. You can
often trace missed putts to poor aim.
My colleague Peter Kostis recently invented a device called the Plane Truth
putting system to help straighten out troubled putters. It’s similar to an old,
tried-and-true putting aid, the string between two rods, which helped golfers
keep the putter going straight back and straight through impact toward the
hole. Straight as a string, get it?
But Peter had a better idea. The Plane Truth putting system features a
Plexiglas panel and a metal bar that attaches to your putter (see Figure 11-5).
Keep the bar in contact with the Plexiglas as you practice and you’ll groove a
smooth stroke that keeps the face of your putter square to the target. I’m
convinced that plenty of tour pros are going to be using Peter’s invention in
the next few years.
Of course, you can’t use such a device during a round of golf. But when you
develop the right stroke on the practice green, you can repeat it on the
course — and watch those putts roll straight and true.

Chapter 11: Typical Problems and Simple Solutions

An important lesson you can learn with devices like this is the crucial rela-
tionship between the putter’s face and the target line. Putting takes a lot of
imagination: If you can picture the line and keep the face of your putter
square to it, you’ll find it easier to stroke the ball along that line to the hole.
With practice, you start to “see” the line on the golf course as you lurk over
those 6-foot putts.
Shanking
Bet the man who has the shanks, and your plate will be full.
—Gary McCord
It must have started centuries ago. Alone with his sheep in a quiet moment of
reflection, a shepherd swung his carved crook at a rather round multicolored
rock, toward a distant half-dead, low-growing vine. The rock peeled off the
old crook, and instead of lurching forward toward the vine, it careened off at
an angle 90 degrees to the right of the target. “What was that?!” cried the sur-
prised shepherd. “That was a shank, you idiot!” cried one of the sheep. “Now
release the toe of that stick or this game will never get off the ground.”
This story has been fabricated to help with the tension of a despicable dis-
ease. The shanks are a virus that attacks the very soul of a golfer. They can
come unannounced and invade the decorum of a well-played round. They
leave with equal haste and lurk in the mind of the golfer, dwelling until the
brain reaches critical mass. Then you have meltdown. This sounds like one of
those diseases that they’re making movies about. And to a golfer, no other
word strikes terror and dread like shank.
As a junior golfer, I was visiting the Tournament of Champions in 1970 when a
bunch of the guys were watching the tournament winners hit balls on the dri-
ving range. I was completely mesmerized by Frank Beard as he hit shank after
shank on the practice tee. My buddies wanted to go watch Nicklaus, but
being somewhat of a masochist, I told them that I would follow Frank the
Shank around and meet them afterward. I witnessed one of the greatest
rounds I have ever seen. He shot a 64 and never missed a shot. How could a
man who was so severely stricken by this disease on the practice tee rally
and unleash a round of golf like he played? That is the mystery of this afflic-
tion. Can it be controlled? Yes!
Shanking occurs when the ball strikes the hosel of the club and goes 90
degrees to right of your intended target. (The hosel is the part of the club
that attaches to the clubhead.) Shankers almost always set up too close 
to the ball, with their weight back on their heels. As they shift forward during
the swing, their weight comes off their heels, moving the club even closer 
to the ball, so that the hosel hits the ball.
186
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

A shank is sometimes called a pitch out, a Chinese hook, El Hosel, a scud, or a
snake killer — you get the idea. When you shank, the heel of your club (the
heel is the closest part of the clubhead to you; the toe is the farthest) contin-
ues toward the target and then ends up right of the target. To eliminate
shanks, you need the toe of the club to go toward the target and then end up
left of the target.
Here’s an easy exercise that helps cure the shanks (see Figure 11-6):
1. Get a two-by-four board and align it along your target line.
2. Put the ball 2 inches from the near edge of the board, and try to hit
the ball.
If you have the shanks, your club will want to hit the board. If you swing
properly, the club will come from the inside and hit the ball. Then the
toe of the club will go left of the target, the ball will go straight, and your
woes will be over.
In a world full of new, emerging viruses, we have the technology to lash back
at this golfing disease and eliminate it altogether from our DNA. Stay calm
and get a two-by-four, practice the drill, and banish the shanks forever.
Release the toe and don’t hit the board.

Just say,
“No
shanks!”

Chapter 11: Typical Problems and Simple Solutions

The Push
The push is a shot that starts right of the target and just keeps going. It isn’t
like a slice, which starts left and then curves to the right; the push just goes
right. This shot happens when the body does not rotate through to the left on
the downswing, and the arms hopelessly swing to the right, “pushing” the
ball in that direction.
Hitting a push is like standing at home plate, aiming at the pitcher, and then
swinging your arms at the first baseman. If this sounds like you, listen up. I’ll
show you how to hit one up the middle: Place a wooden two-by-four parallel
to the target line and about 2 inches beyond the golf ball. You push the ball
because your body stops rotating left on the downswing, and your arms go
off to the right. If your arms go off to the right with that old two-by-four sit-
ting there, splinters are going to fly. Naturally, you don’t want to hit the
board, so you will — hopefully — swing your hips left on the downswing,
which will pull your arms left and stop the push.
The Pull
The pull is a shot that starts left and stays left, unlike a hook, which starts
right of the target and curves left. The pull is caused when the club comes
from outside the target line on the downswing and you pull across your body.
Hitting a pull is like standing at home plate and aiming at the pitcher, but
swinging the club toward the third baseman, which is where the ball would
go. This swing malady is a little more complicated, and it’s more difficult to
pick out one exercise to cure it, so bear with me.
Pulls are caused when your shoulders “open” too fast in the downswing. For the
proper sequence, your shoulders should remain as close to parallel to the target
line as possible at impact. Here’s a checklist that will help you cure your pull:
 Check your alignment. If you’re aimed too far to the right, your body
will slow down on the downswing and allow your shoulders to open at
impact to bring the club back to the target.
 Check your weight shift. If you don’t shift your weight to your left side
on the downswing, you’ll spin your hips out of the way too fast, causing
your shoulders to open up too quickly and hit a putrid pull. So shift
those hips toward the target on the downswing until your weight is on
your left side after impact.
 Check your grip pressure. Too tight a grip on the club will cause you to
tense up on the downswing and come over the top for a pull.
 Check your distance from the ball. Too close and you’ll instinctively
pull inward on your forward swing — which means pulling to the left.
188
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

Power Outage
Everyone in the world would like more distance. John Daly and Michelle Wie
would like more distance. I would like more distance, and I’m sure you would
too. Here are some simple thoughts to help you add yardage:
 Turn your shoulders on the backswing. The more you turn your shoul-
ders on the backswing, the better chance you have to hit the ball longer.
So stretch that torso on the backswing — try to put your left shoulder
over your right foot at the top of your swing.
If you’re having difficulty moving your shoulders enough on the back-
swing, try turning your left knee clockwise until it’s pointing behind the
ball during your backswing. This frees up your hips to turn, and subse-
quently your shoulders. A big turn starts from the ground up.
 Get the tension out of your grip. Hold the club loosely; you should grip
it with the pressure of holding a spotted owl’s egg. If there’s too much
tension in your hands, your forearms and chest will “tighten up,” and
you’ll lose that valuable flexibility that helps with the speed of your
arms and hands.
Turning your hips to the left on the downswing and extending your right arm
on the through-swing are trademarks of the longer hitters. Here’s a drill to
help you accomplish this feat of daring:
1. Tee up your driver in the normal position.
2. Place the ball off your left heel and/or opposite your left armpit.
3. Now reach down, not moving your stance, and move the ball toward
the target the length of the grip.
4. Tee the ball up right there; it should be about 1 foot closer to the hole.
5. Address the ball where the normal position was and swing at the ball
that is now teed up.
To hit that ball, you’ll have to move your hips to the left so that your
arms can “reach the ball,” thereby causing you to extend your right arm.
Practice this drill 20 times and then put the ball back in the normal position.
You should feel faster with the hips and feel a tremendous extension of your
right arm.
The “Worm Burner”
Does your ball look like a duck trying to take off with a bad wing? Do your
friends call you “Stealth”? Do worms fear your dreaded “worm-burner”
drives? If you’re having this problem with your driver, make sure that your
head stays behind the ball at address and at impact. Moving your head back
189
Chapter 11: Typical Problems and Simple Solutions

and forth along with your driver can cause too low a shot. Also, drivers come
in different lofts. If you’re hitting the ball too low, try a driver that has 11 to
12 degrees of loft.
If you’re having a problem with low iron shots, you’re probably trying to lift
those golf balls into the air instead of hitting down. Remember: With irons,
you have to hit down to get the ball up.
Spraying the Ball
If your golf ball takes off in more directions than the compass has to offer,
check your alignment and ball position. Choose the direction you’re going
and then put your feet, knees, and shoulders on a line parallel to the target
line. Be very specific with your alignment.
Ball position can play a major part in poor direction. If the ball is too far for-
ward, it’s easy to push it to the right. If the ball is too far back in your stance,
it’s easy to hit pushes and pulls. The driver is played opposite your left
armpit. (As the club gets shorter, the ball should move back toward the
middle of your stance.)
If nobody is around and you want to check your ball position, here’s what
you can do: Get into your stance — with the driver, for example — and then
undo your shoelaces. Step out of your shoes, leaving them right where they
were at address. Now take a look: Is the ball where it’s supposed to be in your
stance? Two suggestions: If it’s a wet day, don’t try this. And if your socks
have holes in them, make sure nobody is watching.
Hitting from the Top
When you start cocking the wrist in your golf swing, the thumb of your right
hand (if you’re a right-handed golfer) points at your right shoulder on the
backswing. That’s good! When you start the downswing, you should try to
keep that thumb pointing at your right shoulder for as long as you can, thus
maintaining the angle. That’s golfspeak for keeping the shaft of the club as
close to the left arm on the downswing as possible. If your right thumb starts
pointing away from your right shoulder on the downswing, not good! That is
known as hitting from the top. In essence, you’re uncocking the wrist on the
downswing.
To stop hitting from the top, you must reduce your grip pressure. Too much
tension in your hands will make you throw the clubhead toward the ball,
causing you to hit from the top. After you’ve relaxed your grip pressure, get
an old two-by-four and place it on the side of the ball away from you, parallel
to the target line. The ball should be about 2 inches from the board. You’ll
190
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

find that if you keep pointing your right thumb at your right shoulder on the
downswing, you won’t hit the board with your club. If you point your thumb
away from your shoulder on the downswing, your chances of chopping wood
are very good. (See Figure 11-7.)
On the downswing, try to point your right
thumb at your right shoulder (if you‘re
right-handed).
So this is how John Daly does it!
Keep trying!

the top.

Chapter 11: Typical Problems and Simple Solutions

The Reverse Pivot
A reverse pivot occurs when you put all your weight on your left foot on the
backswing (shown in Figure 11-8) and all your weight on your right foot
during the downswing. That is the opposite of what you want to do! Picture a
baseball pitcher. Pitchers have all their weight on the right foot at the top of
the windup, the left foot is in the air (for a right-hander), and on the follow-
through, all the weight goes to the left foot. (The right foot is now in the air.)
That’s the weight transfer you need. Here’s how you can achieve it:
1. Start your backswing, and when you get to the top of your swing, lift
your left foot off the ground.
Now you can’t put any weight on that foot! You’ll feel your whole body
resist placing your weight over your right foot.
2. Take your time and let your weight transfer to your right foot.
3. Start the downswing by placing your left foot back where it was and
then transfer all your weight over during the swing.
4. When you’ve made contact with the ball (hopefully), put all your
weight on your left foot and lift your right foot off the ground.
5. Stand there for a short time, feeling the balance.
Figure 11-8:
Reverse
pivots.

This rocking-chair transfer drill lets you feel the proper weight shift in the
golf swing. Take it easy at first. Practice short shots until you get the feel, and
then work your way up to your driver.
Swaying Off the Ball
In a sway, your hips and shoulders don’t turn on the backswing, but simply
slide back in a straight line, as shown in Figure 11-9. Here’s a good drill to
help you stop swaying:
1. Find a bare wall.
2. Using a 5-iron, place the club on the ground with the clubhead touch-
ing the wall and the shaft extending straight into the room.
3. Place your right foot against the end of the shaft with the little toe of
your right shoe hitting the end of the club.
Now you’re standing exactly one club length from the wall.
4. Put your left foot in the normal address position for the 5-iron and,
without moving your feet, bend over and pick up the club.
Figure 11-9:
Don’t sway
off the ball.
193
Chapter 11: Typical Problems and Simple Solutions

5. Take a backswing.
If you sway with your hips 1 inch to the right on your backswing, you’ll
notice that you hit the wall immediately with the club.
Practice this until you can do it without hitting the wall. I put so many marks
and holes in a motel room doing this drill, I could see the guy in the next room!
I suggest that you practice this drill in your garage at first to save the walls at
home. You may want to use an old club, too.
The Belly-Button Twist
Another common fault is doing the belly-button twist: sliding your hips too
far toward the target at the start of the downswing. How far should your hips
slide before they start turning left? They must slide until your left hip and left
knee are over your left foot. Then those hips turn left in a hurry!
Here’s the best way to improve your hip position at the downswing:
1. Get a broken club that has just a shaft and a grip on it.
You can find broken clubs in lost-and-found barrels, or just ask some-
body at a driving range. Your golf pro can also help you find one.
2. Stick the broken club into the ground just outside your left foot; the
top of the grip should be no higher than your hip.
3. Now hit a few shots.
When you swing, your left hip should not hit the club stuck in the
ground. It should turn to the left of the shaft. The key here is to
straighten the left leg in your follow-through.
A Swing That’s Too Long
If your swing is too long and sloppy (going beyond parallel to the ground at
the top of the swing), here are two positions to work on:
 The right arm in the backswing (for a right-handed golfer) must not bend
more than 90 degrees. It must stay at a right angle (refer to Figure 11-5).
 The right elbow must not get more than a dollar bill’s length (6 inches)
away from your rib cage at the top of the backswing (see Figure 11-10).
If you can maintain these two simple positions at the top of your swing, you
won’t overswing.
194
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

A Swing That’s Too Short
In most cases, a short swing comes from too little shoulder turn. Turn your
left shoulder over your right foot at the top of your backswing. If you can’t,
lift your left heel off the ground until you can. Many players I see with short
swings also keep their right elbows against their rib cages at the top of the
swing. The right elbow should be away from the rib cage (6 inches) to allow
some freedom in the swing and get the needed length to your swing arc.
Not Enough Backspin
How can you back up the ball like the pros on the tour? People ask me this
question all the time. The answer: The more steeply you hit down on the ball
and the faster you swing, the more spin you generate. People who play golf
for a living hit short irons with a very steep angle of descent into the ball,
which creates a lot of spin (along with the extra swing speed a pro gener-
ates). We also tend to play three-piece golf balls with relatively soft covers —
balls that spin more than the two-piece ball most people play. (Chapter 2
explains the different types of golf balls in detail.)
We also play on grass that’s manicured and very short so that we can get a
clean hit with the club off these fairways. All this helps a bunch when you’re
trying to spin the ball. The bottom line is that we’re trying to control the dis-
tance a ball goes. I don’t care if the ball backs up to get to that distance or
rolls forward to get there.
Consistency is knowing how far you can hit each club in your bag. Don’t
worry about how much spin you get; worry about how far each club travels.
Your right arm
should form a right
angle at the elbow.

f you break golf down into its primal form, the sport is simple. All you have
to do is hit a ball from a flat piece of ground (you even get to tee the ball
up) to, say, a 40-yard-wide fairway, find the ball, and then hit the ball onto a
prepared putting surface. Then the golf gods allow you to hit not one, but two
putts. And even after all that stuff, you still get to call your score par.
However — you knew there had to be a catch, didn’t you? — golf isn’t often
so straightforward. For one thing, you’re going to make mistakes. We all do.
Usually the same ones over and over. That won’t change, by the way. Even
the best players in the world have little glitches in their swings that give
them problems. Everyone has a bad shot that he or she tends to hit when
things go wrong. You may not hit that fairway with your drive or that green
with your approach shot, or you may miss both. You may take three putts to
get the ball into the hole now and again. And golf doesn’t often take place on
a level playing field. Not every shot is played from a perfectly flat piece of
ground. Very seldom is the ball lying enticingly atop the grass. (Unless you’re
the guy at our course that we call “The Foot.” He never has a bad lie.) Often
wind or rain is in your face or at your back.
No two shots are ever exactly the same, particularly when you stray from the
straight and narrow. When you start making friends with trees, rough, and all
the other flora and fauna out there, your ball is going to land in places a lawn
mower has never been. And you have to know how to escape from those and
many other awkward spots (see Figure 12-1).

Eat Your Roughage!
Well, Mom, if you knew that I was going to end up playing the PGA Tour and
Champions Tour with a crooked driver, you probably wouldn’t have left me
with those words of wisdom. I’ve eaten a lot of rough getting from tee to
green, but I think it’s made me a better person.
Rough is the grass on the golf course that looks like it should be mowed. It’s
usually 2 to 3 inches in length and lurks everywhere but the tees, fairways,
and greens. I grew up on a municipal golf course where the grass was short
everywhere because the only thing they watered down was the whiskey.
When you try to hit a ball out of long grass, the grass gets between the club-
face and the ball. The ball then has no backspin and goes off like a Scud mis-
sile, and direction can be a concern. But the real problem is that, with no
backspin, the ball can take a longer voyage than you expected. The lack of
backspin means less drag occurs while the ball is in the air. That’s never been
a problem with the driver off the tee, but it’s a concern when you’re trying to
hit the ball a certain distance.
If you get into trouble on the course,
you’ll often be faced
with a choice of
escape routes.
Figure 12-1:
Under or

198
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

My philosophy is that if the lie is bad enough, just get the ball back into the
fairway. If you can hit the ball, the technique for this shot is much the same
as the shot out of a divot: Play the ball back in your stance and put your
hands forward. A chopping-down motion allows the club to come up in the
backswing and avoid the long grass; then you can hit down on the ball. Swing
hard, because if you swing easily, the grass will wrap around the club and
twist it, giving the ball an unpredictable trajectory.
The more you play this game, the more you’ll hit these shots, and the more
you’ll understand how to play them. Keep your sense of humor and a firm
grip on the club, and enjoy your roughage — your mother was right!
Tree Trouble
A walk in the woods can be a serene, soul-enhancing, mystical journey, blend-
ing one’s spirit and body into nature and all her beauty. But when I’m walking
into the trees to find my golf ball, I feel like I’m in a house of mirrors with
branches and leaves. The trees seem to be laughing at my predicament, and I
end up talking to them in less-than-flattering dialogue. You’ve got the picture
by now.
The trees are playing games with me. And so, to extract my ball from this
boundless maze of bark, I play a game with the trees. Usually, one lone tree is
in my way as I try to exit this forest. All I do is take dead aim at that tree and
try to knock it over with the ball. The key here is to not be too close to the
tree in case you score a direct hit. You don’t want to wear that Titleist 3 as a
permanent smile.
My reasoning is that I got into these trees with something less than a straight
shot. So if I now try to hit something that is 30 yards away from me and only
12 inches in diameter, what’s the chance that I’ll hit it? If I do hit it, what a
great shot it was, and I turn a negative into a positive. I’m still in the trees,
but I’m happy about my shot. Now you probably know why I’m in television
and not on the regular tour anymore.
Special Shots
Because golf is a game of mistake management, you’re going to get into trou-
ble at least a few times in every round. How you cope with those moments
and shots determines your score for the day and, ultimately, your ability to
play well. Never forget that even the greatest rounds have moments of crisis.
Stay calm when your heart tries to eject through the top of your head.

Chapter 12: How to Beat Bad Luck and Bad Weather

Special shots have diversity, too. Trouble lurks everywhere on a golf course.
You have to know how to hit long shots, short shots, and, perhaps most
important, in-between shots. All sorts of shots exist. You may be faced with a
shot from 200 yards where a clump of trees blocks your path to the hole. Or
you may be only 50 yards from the hole and have to keep the ball under
branches and yet still get it over a bunker. Whatever the situation, the key is
applying the magic word — time out for a drum roll — imagination.
A vivid imagination is a great asset on the golf course. If you can picture the
way a shot has to curve in the air in order to land safely, you’re halfway to
success. All you have to do is hit the ball. And the best way to accomplish
both things is through practice — practice on the course, that is. You can’t
re-create on the range most shots that you encounter out on the course. The
range is flat; the course isn’t. The wind constantly blows the same way on the
range. On the course, the only constant about the wind is that it changes
direction. That’s golf — a wheel of bad fortune.
The best way to practice these weird and wonderful shots is to challenge
yourself. See how low you can hit a shot. Or how high. Practice hitting from
bad lies and see how the ball reacts. Play from slopes, long grass, and all the
rest. Or play games with your friends. The first player to hit over that tree,
for example, gets $5. The trick is to make practice competitive and fun — and
also beat your friends out of five bucks.
Wait a minute, though. Hang on. I’m getting a little ahead of myself. I have to
tell you that many of the trouble shots hit by the pros are not only very low-
percentage plays but also way, way out of most people’s reach. Even the pros
miss the tough shots now and again. And when they do miss, the conse-
quence means triple bogey (a score of 3 over par for one hole — for example,
a 7 on a par-4) or worse. So admire them. But never, ever try to copy them —
at least not yet.
The good news is that at this stage of your development, all you need is a
couple of basic shots. Leave the really fancy stuff for another time, another
book. All you need to know to score well is how to hit the ball low or high
back onto the fairway. That’s enough to cover 99 percent of the situations
that you’ll encounter. Better to give up one shot than risk three more on a
shot that you couldn’t pull off more than once in 20 tries.
Altitude adjustment
Because golf isn’t played in a controlled environment, you’re going to come
across situations where a higher or lower shot is required. For example, when
you have a strong wind in your face, a lower shot is going to go farther and
hold its line better. The great thing is that you make all your adjustments
before you begin. Then after you start your backswing, you can make your
regular swing. You don’t have to worry about adding anything else. Figure 12-2
illustrates the following shots.

Chapter 12: How to Beat Bad Luck and Bad Weather

Hitting the ball lower
Hitting the ball low is easy. All you have to do is subtract from the effective
loft of the club. And the best way to do that is to adjust your address posi-
tion. Play the ball back in your stance, toward your right foot. Move your
hands toward the target until they’re over your left leg.
Now you swing, focusing on re-creating the positional relationship between
your hands and the clubface as the ball is struck. In other words, your hands
should be “ahead” of the clubface at impact, thus ensuring that the ball flies
lower than normal.
This sort of technique is commonly employed when playing in Florida, Texas,
and Hawaii, where golf swings get a little shorter and the divots get a little
longer. When you play the ball back in your stance with your hands ahead, you
come down into the ground with a more abrupt angle that takes more turf.
I remember one good story about a low shot. It happened years ago during
the Bing Crosby tournament on the 7th hole at Pebble Beach (a downhill par-
3 of 110 yards). From an elevated tee, you can just about throw the ball to the
green. On this particular day, the wind was howling from the coast (the green
sits on the ocean), and the 7th hole was impossible. Water was erupting from
the rocks; wind was blowing water everywhere; seals were hiding; and seag-
ulls were walking. Definitely a bad day for windblown golf balls.
Billy Casper arrived on the tee and surveyed the situation. Many players were
using long irons (irons that go 200 yards) because the wind was so fierce. Billy
went to his bag and got his putter! He putted the ball down a cart path into the
front bunker. From there he got the ball down in two for his par-3. Now that’s
keeping it low into the wind and using your imagination!
Hitting the ball higher
As you’d expect, hitting the ball higher than normal involves making the
opposite adjustments at address. Adjust your stance so that the ball is for-
ward in your stance, toward your left foot. Then move your hands back, away
from the target. Again, hitting the ball is that simple. All you have to do is
reproduce that look at impact, and the ball takes off on a steeper trajectory.
Gyroscope golf: Sidehill lies
Not many golf courses are flat. Every now and again, you need to hit a shot
off a slope. The ball may be below or above your feet. Both positions are side-
hill lies. Or you may be halfway up or down a slope.
202
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

When you’re faced with any or all of these situations, you need to make an
adjustment. And again, if you can make most of your changes before starting
your swing, things are a lot easier. The common factor in all these shots is
the relationship between your shoulders and the slope. On a flat lie, you’re
bent over the ball in a certain posture. You should stand about 90 degrees to
the ground.
In other words, if the ball is above your feet, you have to lean a little into the
hill to keep your balance. If you stood at your normal posture to the upslope
of the hill, you would fall backward. You’re close to the ball because of the
lean, and you need to choke up on the club.
The reverse is also true. With the ball below your feet, lean back more to
retain your balance on the downslope. Because you’re leaning back, you’re a
little farther away from the ball; grip the club all the way to the end and use
the whole length of the shaft.
The main idea for sidehill lies is to stay balanced. I don’t want you falling
down the hills.
For uphill and downhill lies, it’s a little different. Imagine that your ball is
halfway up a staircase, and you have to hit the next shot to the top. Because
your left leg is higher than your right, your weight naturally shifts to your
right leg. Let that weight shift happen so that your shoulders are parallel to
the banister. On a downslope, your weight shifts in the opposite direction,
onto your left leg. Again, let that weight shift happen. Keep your shoulders
and the banister parallel, as shown in Figure 12-3.
Finally, follow these three rules:
 Adjust your aim when you’re on a slope. Off a downslope or when the
ball is below your feet, aim to the left of where you want the ball to
finish. Off an upslope or when the ball is above your feet, aim right.
 As far as ball position is concerned, play the ball back toward the
middle of your stance if you’re on a downhill lie, or forward, off your
left big toe, from an uphill lie.
 Take more club (a club that has less loft) if you’re on an uphill lie
because the ball tends to fly higher. Use less club (a club that has
more loft) from a downhill lie because the ball has a lower trajectory
in this situation. For example, if the shot calls for a 7-iron, take your 8-
iron instead. Remember: From these lies, swing about 75 percent of your
normal swing speed to keep your balance. Practice with different clubs
from different lies to get a feel for these shots.
203
Chapter 12: How to Beat Bad Luck and Bad Weather

You can dig it: Hitting out of divots
Unfortunately for your blood pressure, your ball occasionally finishes in a
hole made by someone who previously hit a shot from the same spot and
forgot to replace the grass. These holes are known as divots. Landing in a
divot may cause quiet muttering beneath your breath, but don’t panic. To get
the ball out, first set up with the ball farther back in your stance to encourage
a steeper attack at impact. Push your hands forward a little, too. You need to
feel as if you’re really hitting down on this shot. A quicker cocking of the
wrists on the backswing helps, too. I like to swing a little more upright on the
backswing with the club (take the arms away from the body going back). This
allows a steeper path down to the ball. (See Figure 12-4.)
Depending on the severity and depth of the divot, take a club with more loft
than you would normally use. You need extra loft to counteract the ball being
below ground level. Don’t worry — the ball comes out lower because your
hands are ahead of the ball. That makes up for the distance lost by using less
club.
When you’re feeling uncomfortable over the ball as it sits in that divot,
remember that the ball will come out a lot lower and run along the ground
more than a normal shot. So aim your shot accordingly.
On an upslope, leave your weight
on your right side.
On a downslope, shift your weight
to your left side.
Figure 12-3:
Keep
shoulders
and slope
parallel.
204

When ball is in a divot hole,
move your hands forward.
Cock your wrists more than usual…
and then hit down and through.
Figure 12-4:
Escaping a
divot.
205
Chapter 12: How to Beat Bad Luck and Bad Weather

On the downswing of your shot out of a divot, there will be little or no follow-
through. Because the ball is back in your stance and your hands are forward,
your blow should be a descending blow. (When is the last time you had a
follow-through when chopping wood?)
The one thought I’ve had in this situation is, Don’t swing too hard. When you
swing too hard, you move your head and don’t hit the ball squarely. And
when the ball is lying below the ground, you must hit it squarely.
Toupee Alert: Strong Winds Reported
When conditions are rough because of wind or rain, scores go up. You have
to be ready for that occurrence. Adjust your goals. Don’t panic if you start off
badly or have a couple of poor holes. Be patient and realize that sometimes
conditions make it difficult to play golf. And remember that bad weather con-
ditions are equally tough on all the other players.
I’ve played professional golf for some 25-odd years, and I’ve played in some
very bad conditions. Because I’m not a patient person, my scores in bad
weather have been high. If I got a few strokes over par early in my round, I
would take too many chances during the rest of the round trying to make
some birdies. I’d then boil as I watched my score rise with my blood pres-
sure. A calm head and good management skills are just as important as hit-
ting the ball solidly when you’re trying to get through tough days in the wind
and rain.
I remember playing the TPC Championship at Sawgrass in the late 1980s on
one of the windiest days we’d ever seen. J. C. Snead hit a beautiful downwind
approach to an elevated green. Somehow the ball stopped on the green with
the wind blowing upwards of 50 mph. J. C. started walking toward the green
when his Panama hat blew off and started to tumble toward the green. After
minutes of scurrying along the ground, the hat blew onto the green and hit
his golf ball! That’s a 2-shot penalty, and an incredibly bad case of luck.
If the wind is blowing hard enough to be a nuisance, the following may help
you deal with wind conditions:
 Widen your stance to lower your center of gravity. This automatically
makes your swing shorter (for control) because turning your body is
more difficult when your feet are set wider apart. (See Figure 12-5.)
 Swing easier. I always take a less-lofted club than normal and swing
easier. This way, I have a better chance of hitting the ball squarely. By
hitting the ball squarely, I can count on a consistent distance the ball
will travel with every club, even in bad conditions.
206
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

 Use the wind — don’t abuse the wind. Let the ball go where the wind
wants it to go. Don’t try to fight it, or it’ll be a long day. If the wind is
blowing left to right at 30 mph, aim your ball left and let the wind bring it
back. Don’t aim right and try to hook it back into the wind. Leave that up
to the airline pilots and the guys on the PGA Tour!
 Choke down on the club. Choking down means that you don’t have to
keep your left hand (for right-handed golfers) all the way at the end of
the grip. This gives you more control. I like to put my left hand about 1
inch from the top of the grip. I have more control over the club, but the
ball doesn’t go as far because I don’t use the full length of the shaft.
 Allow for more run downwind and for shorter flight against the wind.
This part of the game has to be experienced to be understood. The more
you play in windy conditions, the more comfortable you become in
them.
A wide stance helps you keep
your balance in a breeze.

Waterworld: Swingin’ in the Rain
I’m from Southern California. I never saw too much rain, let alone played in it
all the time. The rain that would make us Californians stay inside and play
Yahtzee would be nothing for my buddies from the Pacific Northwest. They
learned how to play in the rain and expected to play in the rain.
The right equipment: Smooth 
sailing or choppy seas
The best advice I can give you for playing in the rain is to be prepared to play
in it. Pack all the equipment you’ll need to handle the wetness:
 An umbrella: Pack one of those big golf umbrellas. And never open it
downwind, or you’ll end up like Mary Poppins, and the umbrella will end
up looking like modern art.
 Good rain gear: That means jackets, pants, and headwear designed to
be worn in the rain. You can spend as much as you want on these items.
If you play in wet weather all the time, get yourself some good stuff that
will last a long time. I don’t mean a garbage bag with holes cut out for
your head and arms. I mean the stuff that you buy from a pro shop or
see in a magazine ad. Good rain gear costs between $100 and $700. Gore-
Tex, a fabric that repels water, is a very popular fabric for rain gear.
 Dry gloves: If you wear gloves, keep a few in plastic bags in your golf
bag. They’ll stay dry if you leave a pocket open and the rain comes pour-
ing in.
 Dry towels: Keep several dry towels in your bag, because the one you
have outside will get wet sooner or later. On the Champions Tour, I keep
a dry towel hanging from the rib on the underside of my umbrella and
another dry one inside my side pocket. When it gets really wet, I wipe
my club off on the closest dry caddie.
 Dry grips: This is one of the most important things to have in wet-weather
golf. I once had a club slip out of my hands on the driving range and fly
through the snack-shop window. I blamed it on an alien spacecraft.
 Waterproof shoes: Keep an extra pair of socks in your bag, too, in case
the advertiser lied about those “waterproof” shoes.
Wet course conditions
A golf course changes significantly in the rain. You need to adjust your game
accordingly and keep the following in mind:
208
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

 On a rainy day, the greens will be slow. Hit your putts harder and remem-
ber that the ball won’t curve as much.
 If you hit a ball in the bunker, the sand will be firmer, and you won’t have
to swing as hard to get the ball out.
 The golf course will play longer because it’s so soft. The good news is
that the fairways and greens get softer and more receptive. The fairways
and greens become, in effect, wider and bigger, respectively, because
your shots don’t bounce into trouble as much.
 Try not to let the conditions affect your normal routines. The best rain
players always take their time and stay patient.
 Playing in the rain is one thing — playing in lightning is another thing
altogether. When lightning strikes, your metallic golf club (along with the
fact that you tend to be the highest point on the golf course, unless
there’s a tree around) can make you a target. Don’t take chances. Drop
your club and take cover.
A Game for All Seasons: Weathering 
the Elements
If you live in Florida, California, or Arizona, you only notice the change of sea-
sons when 40 bazillion golfers from colder climes flood the area trying to get
the seven starting times that are still available. If you live in an all-season cli-
mate and prefer to enjoy the changing weather without giving up your golf
game, this section offers some tips.
Swing into spring: Time to 
thaw out and get to work
The golfing populace anticipates spring like no other season. You’ve been
indoors for most of the winter, and you’ve read every book pertaining to your
golf game. You’ve watched endless hours of golf on TV and ingested every-
thing the announcers have told you not to do. It’s time to bloom!
One of the first things you need to do is decide your goals for the upcoming
year. Is your goal to be a better putter? Or do you want to become a longer
driver? Or do you simply want to get the ball off the ground with more 
regularity?
Establish what you want to do with your game, and then set out to accom-
plish that feat. Set simple and attainable goals and work to achieve them.
209
Chapter 12: How to Beat Bad Luck and Bad Weather

My other springtime advice:
 Practice all phases of your game. Don’t neglect weak areas of your
game, but stay on top of your strengths as well. Spring is a time of 
blossoming — let your game do the same.
 Map out an exercise program. You probably neglected exercise during
the winter. Spring is a good time to map out a game plan for your physi-
cal needs. Are you strong enough in your legs? Does your rotator cuff
need strength? Does your cardiovascular system short out later in the
round? Address these problems and get on a treadmill or hit the weight
room. Chapter 4 tells you how you can develop a golf-specific fitness
program.
 Dress for the weather. Spring is the hardest time of year to figure out
what to wear. It can be hot. It can be cold. It can rain. It can be blowing
40 mph. It can be doing all these things in the first three holes. If you’re
carrying your bag, it can get heavy with all the extra gear in it. Take
along your rain gear. Take along a light jacket. Bring hand warmers 
and your umbrella. Put an extra towel in your bag. Take along some 
antihistamines — it’s spring and the pollen is everywhere.
 Learn about yourself and your golf game. Remember: Spring is the
time of year to be enlightened.
To be surprised, to wonder, is to begin to understand.
—Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset
Summer golf: Fun in the sun
Summer is the time of year to go play the game. I hope that you’ve been prac-
ticing hard on your game, working toward those goals you set forth in the
spring. But there’s a big difference between practicing and playing. The more
you practice, the easier you should find it to play the game well. Summer is
the time to find out whether your game has improved.
The following suggestions will help you make the most of your days in the sun:
 Work on your course management. How can you best play this particu-
lar golf course? Sometimes, for one reason or another, you can’t play a
certain hole. Figure out how you can avoid the trouble you’re having on
that hole and devise a plan. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Do
you have the discipline to carry out your plan? That’s why summer is
great for playing the game and understanding yourself. You can go out
after work and play 18 holes before it gets dark. Summer is the time to
stop thinking about your golf swing and become the ball.
210
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

 Maintain your equipment. During the summer, I get new grips on my
clubs. The grips are called half cord because they have some cord
blended into the underside of the grip. The new grips give me a better
hold on the club during sweaty summers. I also use a driver with a little
more loft to take advantage of summer’s drier air (which causes the ball
to fly farther).
 Practice competing by playing in organized leagues. You play a differ-
ent game when your score counts and is published in the local paper.
 Dress for fun in the sun. Take along sunblock of at least SPF 15, and put
it on twice a day. Not everyone wants to look like George Hamilton. And
wear a hat that covers your ears. Mine burn off in the summer.
 Play in the mornings. The afternoons are often too darned hot.
 Drink plenty of fluids during those hot days. You don’t want to dehy-
drate and shrivel up like a prune, so keep your liquid intake constant. I
try to drink water on every tee during the heat of summer. One hint:
Alcoholic beverages will knock you on your rear end if you drink them
outdoors on a hot day. Stick with water and save the adult beverages for
the 19th hole.
Have a ball in the fall
Without a doubt, fall is the best time of year to play golf: The golf courses are
in good shape, the leaves are turning in much of the country, and the scenery
is amazing. The weather is delightful, and all sorts of sports are on TV. Both
you and your game should be in good shape.
If you have the time and the money, make travel plans to the Northeast and
play golf there. The colors are astounding. I live in Vail, Colorado, which is
also breathtaking in the fall. Many vacation plans can make the trip afford-
able. Get a bunch of friends you enjoy and start planning a trip now. My
house is out, though — it’s way too small.
Play as much golf as you can in the fall so that you’ll be really tired of the
game and won’t miss it so much going into the winter — then you can take a
legitimate golf break.
Here are three fall golf tips:
 Dress for the fall much like you do for the spring. Take a lot of stuff
with you because the weather can do anything.
 Assess everything you did with your game this year. Did your tech-
niques work? If not, were your goals unrealistic? Was your teacher help-
ful? Take a long, hard look and start to devise a game plan for next spring.
211
Chapter 12: How to Beat Bad Luck and Bad Weather

 Look at new equipment as your game progresses. Fall is a good time to
buy equipment, because all the new stuff comes out in the spring. By fall,
prices are lower for last year’s clubs. I love a good buy, though I haven’t
had to buy clubs since I bought a putter eight years ago in San Diego.
Winterize your game
If you choose to get away from the fireplace, golf in the winter can be tolera-
ble. For much of the country, anyone can play in the winter on a reasonable
day with a light wind — especially when you don’t have to mow the grass
until April.
Prepare yourself for brisk weather
If you’re brave enough to venture onto the frozen tundra, I have three musts
for you:
 Take a large Thermos with something warm to drink for the whole
day. You may think that bourbon chasers will make the day much more
fun, but the golf deteriorates and you’ll actually feel colder.
 Dress warmly. I’ve used silk long johns on cold days, and they work
well. Women’s seamless long johns work best, but if you’re a guy, the
salesperson looks at you funny when you ask for a women’s size 14. That
kind of request may lead to the wrong conclusions.
• Wear waterproof golf shoes and thick socks. Some hunting socks
have little heaters in them. I also wear wool pants over my silk long
johns and then use my rain pants as the top layer when it’s really
cold. A turtleneck with a light, tightly knit sweater does well under
a rain or wind jacket made of Gore-Tex or one of those other new
miracle-fiber, space-age fabrics. A knit ski cap tops off this cozy
ensemble.
• Among the great inventions of all time are those little hand
warmers that come in plastic pouches. You shake those things,
and they stay warm for eight hours. I put them everywhere on cold
days. Let your imagination run wild. Hand warmers can keep you
toasty on a cold winter’s day when you’re three down to your
worst enemy.
• Keep your hands warm by using cart gloves. These oversize fin-
gerless gloves have a soft, warm lining and fit right over your hand,
even if you’re already wearing a glove. I put a hand warmer in 
each one.
 Your attitude is the best weapon for a harsh winter day. Remember:
you’re out on the course for the exercise — walk instead of taking a cart.
Besides, you really feel cold when your fresh face collides with an arctic
blast of winter. If you must take a cart, make sure that it has a wind-
shield. Some clubs have enclosed carts with heaters in them.
212
Part III: Common Faults and Easy Fixes 

Adjust your swing for a cold day
When you swing a club with all these clothes on, you probably won’t have as
long a swing as normal. The clothes restrict your motion. I usually take my
jacket off to swing the club and then put it right back on. Because of the
restriction of the clothes, I make my swing a little slower than normal, which
helps put my swing into a slow rhythm on a cold day. Don’t get fast and furi-
ous to get done.
Keep in mind a couple of other points when you’re playing in cold weather:
 Lower your expectations as the weather worsens. When you’re dressed
for the Iditarod, don’t think that you can pull off the same shots that you
normally do. Good short game skills and game management are the most
important aspects of winter golf.
 Get counseling if you play much in these extreme conditions. Golf may
be too much of a priority in your life.
Indoor golf: What you can do at home
Winter is the time to practice fixing all those faults that you accumulated
during the preceding year. Here’s how:
1. Place a large mirror behind you.
2. Pretend that you’re hitting away from the mirror, and check your
swing when your shaft is parallel to the ground in your backswing.
Is your shaft on a line that’s parallel to the line made by your toes? If it
is, that’s good.
3. Continue to swing and go to the top.
Is your shaft on a line that’s parallel to the line made by your heels? If it
is, that’s good.
These two positions are important to the golf swing. Repeat this exercise
until you can do it in your sleep.
Winter is a good time to become one with your swing (say what?). Have
someone make a videotape of your golf swing. Play the tape over and over
until you have a really good picture of what it looks like. Feel your own swing.
Then work on those areas that you need to attend to — an instructor can
help determine those areas (see Chapter 3 for more on working with an
instructor). Make your changes and do another tape of your swing. Not only
should you be able to see the changes, but you should feel them as well.
Videotaping helps you understand your movements and helps the body and
brain get on the same page. Golf can be Zenlike.
If you really can’t get golf off your mind (and it’s too cold to go ice fishing!),
stay safe and warm indoors and check out the online golf options that I dis-
cuss in Chapter 17.

know how to access instruction from various sources, and you know
your way around different sorts of courses. You’ve developed a swing that
suits your body and soul. You’re armed with simple fixes for common prob-
lems, and you know how to play in all sorts of weather. At this point, you
could probably hit a terrific bunker shot from a buried lie during a tornado!
Well, maybe during a blustery day. I’ll save tornado play for a future edition
of this book. The point is, you’re ready to get out there and put all your learn-
ing to the test.
Warming Up Your Body
After you’ve warmed up your mind, you need to do the same for your body.
Warm-ups are important. Not only do a few simple exercises loosen your
muscles and help your swing, but they also help you psychologically as well.
I like to step onto the first tee knowing that I’m as ready as I can be. Feeling
loose rather than tight is reassuring. Besides, golfers, along with the rest of
the world, are a lot more aware of physical fitness and diet today than in days
gone by. Lee Trevino, a two-time U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA champion
and later one of the top players on the senior tour, calls the PGA Tour players
“flat-bellies.” Which they are, compared to some of the more rotund “round-
bellies” on the senior tour. I think this is called progress!

Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 
Staying positive: It’s never your fault
Okay, you’re ready to hit the links. The first thing
you need to be sure of is that you’re at the right
course. The second thing is that you know where
each hole goes. Both may seem obvious and
easy to achieve, but things can go wrong. I know.
I’ve been there. Listen to this tale of woe from a
few years ago.
I was trying to qualify for the U.S. Open. The sec-
tional qualifying course I was assigned to was
Carlton Oaks in Southern California. No problem.
I’d played there many times and knew the course
well. I’d have a good shot at qualifying on this
course. Or so I thought.
I got to the 13th hole and still had a chance of
making the U.S. Open. But I needed a good finish.
The 13th is a dogleg to the left, par-4, some 400-
plus yards: a good testing hole. But I needed a
birdie, so I decided to hit my drive down the 12th
fairway, the hole I had just played. That would
leave me a better angle for my second shot to
the 13th green and cut more than 50 yards from
the hole. The only slight snag was that my ball
would have to fly over some trees.
I drove the ball perfectly and then hit a long iron
to the green over the trees, a good one, too. The
only thing I recall thinking is that the hole was
longer than I remembered; I had to hit a 4-iron to
the green when I expected a 7-iron to be enough.
Still, I hit it solidly, so all was well.
When I got to the green, I was alone. So I waited
for the rest of my group. And waited. And waited.
Eventually I lost patience, putted out, and then
started to look for the others. I soon found them.
They were waving to me from a green about
100 yards away. I had played to the wrong green!
There was only one thing left to do. Two, actually.
I fired my caddie and walked to the clubhouse.
Luckily, I found the right clubhouse.
Firing my caddie may seem petty, but the caddie
is actually an important part of being a profes-
sional golfer. Even if you aren’t a pro, no matter
what goes wrong on the course, it is never — I
repeat, never — your fault. You must always find
someone or something else to blame for any mis-
fortune. In other words, you must be creative in
the excuse department.
There have been some great excuses over the
years. My own favorite came from Greg Norman.
A few years ago, he blamed a miscued shot on
a worm popping up out of the ground next to his
ball as he swung. Poor Greg was so distracted
that he couldn’t hit the shot properly! Then there
was Jack Nicklaus at the 1995 British Open at
St. Andrews. In the first round, Jack hit his
second shot on the 14th hole, a long par-5, into
what is known as Hell Bunker. It’s well named,
being basically a large, deep, sand-filled hole in
the ground. Anyway, seeing his ball down there
came as a bit of a surprise to Jack. He appar-
ently felt that his shot should have flown com-
fortably over said bunker. And his excuse? His
ball must have been deflected by seed heads!
These two examples are extreme, of course. But
you should apply the same principle to your game.
You can often tell a good player from his reaction
to misfortune. He’ll blame his equipment, the wind,
a bad yardage, whatever. On the other hand, less-
secure golfers take all responsibility for bad shots.
Whatever they do is awful. In fact, they really
stink at this stupid game. That’s what they tell
themselves — usually to the point that it ruins their
next shot. And the next. And the next. Whatever
they perceive themselves to be, they become.
Again, that’s the extreme example. Just be sure
that you err toward the former rather than the
latter. What the heck, be a little unrealistic. Try
to fool yourself!

Johnny Bench, the great Cincinnati Reds catcher, showed me the following
stretches. He used them when he played baseball, and he’s in the Hall of
Fame — so who am I to argue?
Holding a club by the head, place the grip end in your armpit so that the
shaft runs the length of your arm (use a club that is the same length as your
arm for this one, as shown in Figure 13-1). That action in itself stretches your
arm and shoulders. Now bend forward until your arm is horizontal. The for-
ward movement stretches your lower back, one of the most important areas
in your body when it comes to playing golf. If your back is stiff, making a full
turn on the backswing is tough. Hold this position for a few seconds; then
switch arms and repeat. Keep doing this stretch until you feel ready to swing.
Another method of loosening up is more traditional. Instead of practicing
your swing with one club in your hands, double the load (see Figure 13-2).
Swing two clubs. Go slowly, trying to make as full a back-and-through swing
as you can. The extra weight soon stretches away any tightness.
This next exercise is one that you’ll see many players use on the first tee.
Jack Nicklaus has always done it. All you have to do is place a club across
your back and hold it in place with your hands or elbows. Then turn back
and through as if making a golf swing, as shown in Figure 13-3. Again, this
action really stretches your back muscles.
Holding the club like this, bend forward.
Then switch arms and do it again.

Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

Warming Up Your Swing
If you go to any professional golf tournament, you’ll see that most players
show up on the practice range about an hour before they’re due to tee off.
Showing up early leaves them time to tune their swings and strokes before
the game starts for real.
I’m one of those players who like to schedule about an hour for pre-round
practice. But half that time is probably enough for you. You’re only going to
hit some balls so that you can build a feel and a rhythm for the upcoming
round. You shouldn’t make any last-minute changes to your swing.
Start your warm-up by hitting some short wedge shots (see Figure 13-4).
Don’t go straight to your driver and start blasting away. That’s asking for
trouble. You can easily pull a muscle if you swing too hard too soon. Plus, it’s
unlikely that you’ll immediately begin to hit long, straight drives if you don’t
warm up first. More than likely, you’ll hit short, crooked shots. And those
aren’t good for the psyche.

Before each round, hit a few wedge shots…
and then a few 6-irons…

and finish up with a few long putts.
Figure 13-4:

up.
221
Chapter 13: Ready, Set, Play!

1. Start with the wedge.
Focus on making contact with the ball. Nothing else. Try to turn your
shoulders a little more with each shot. Hit about 20 balls without worry-
ing about where they’re going. Just swing the club smoothly.
2. Move next to your midirons.
I like to hit my 6-iron at this point. I’m just about warmed up, and the 6-iron
has just enough loft that I don’t have to work too hard at getting the ball
flying forward. Again, hit about 20 balls.
3. Hit the big stick.
I recommend that you hit no more than a dozen drives. Getting carried
away with this club is easy. And when you go overboard, your swing can
get a little quick. Remember: You’re only warming up. Focus on your
rhythm and timing — not on the ball.
4. Before you leave the range, hit a few more balls with your wedge.
You’re not looking for distance with this club, only smoothness. That’s a
good thought to leave with.
5. Finally, spend about ten minutes on the practice putting green.
You need to get a feel for the pace of the greens. Start with short uphill
putts of 2 to 3 feet. Get your confidence and then proceed to longer
putts of 20 to 30 feet. After that, practice putting to opposite fringes to
get the feeling of speed. Focus on the pace rather than the direction.
You’re ready now — knock them all in!
First-Tee Strategies
The best players start every round with a plan for how they’re going to
approach the course. They know which holes they can attack and which
holes are best to play safely. So should you.
Many people say that golf is 90 percent mental and 10 percent physical. You’ll
find a lot of truth in that statement. The fewer mental errors you make, the
lower your score will be. And the great thing about bad thinking is that every-
one at every level of play can work on eliminating it.
Think of golf as a game of chess. You have to think two or three moves ahead.
Over every shot, you should be thinking, “Where do I need to put this ball in
order to make my next shot as easy as possible?”
I could write a whole book on the countless number of strategic situations
you can find yourself in on the course. Trouble is, I don’t have the space for
that in this book, and you don’t need all that information yet. So what follows
222
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

is a brief overview of “tactical golf.” I’ve selected three common situations;
you’ll come across each one at least once in almost every round you play.
You can apply the thinking and strategy behind each one to many other prob-
lems that you’ll encounter. So don’t get too wrapped up in the specifics of
each scenario — think “big picture.”
Strategy 1: Don’t be a sucker
You’re playing a 170-yard par-3 hole (see Figure 13-5). As you can see, the
hole is cut toward the left side of the green, behind a large bunker. If your
first inclination is to fire straight at the flag, think again. Ask yourself these
questions:
 What are your chances of pulling off such a difficult shot?
 What happens if you miss?
 Is the shot too risky?
If the answers are (a) less than 50 percent, (b) you take 5 to get down from
the bunker, or (c) yes, then play toward the safe part of the green.
Only if you happen to be an exceptional bunker player should you even try to
go for the flag.
Think of it this way: Golf is a game of numbers. If you shoot at the pin here,
you bring the number 2 into play. If you hit a great shot, you have a great
opportunity for a deuce. That’s the upside. The downside is that missing the
green makes the numbers 5, 6, and maybe even 7 possibilities, especially if
you aren’t too strong from sand or if you’re unlucky enough to find a really
bad lie.
If, on the other hand, you play for the middle of the green, your numbers are
reduced. Say you hit the putting surface with your first shot. In all likelihood,
the most you can take for the hole is 4, and you can take that only if you 3-putt.
You’ll get a lot of 3s from that position, and once in a while you’ll hole the long
putt — so a 2 isn’t impossible.
Even if you miss the green on that side, you’ll probably be left with a relatively
simple chip or pitch. So unless you mess up terribly, 4 is again your worst score
for the hole. I like those numbers better, don’t you?
Anyway, those are the specifics of this particular situation. In the broader
scheme of things, you should follow this policy more often than not. If you
decide to be a middle-of-the-green shooter, practice your long-putting a lot.
You’re going to have a lot of 30- to 40-foot putts, so be ready for them. In the
long run, you’ll come out ahead.

Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

Strategy 2: Think before you drive
You’re on a par-4 hole of just over 400 yards (see Figure 13-6). But the actual
yardage isn’t that important. The key to this hole is the narrowing of the fair-
way at the point where your drive is most likely to finish. When this situation
comes up, tee off with your 3-wood, 5-wood, or whatever club you can hit
safely into the wide part of the fairway. Even if you can’t quite reach the
green in two shots, that’s the best strategy. Again, it’s a question of numbers.
If you risk hitting your driver and miss the fairway, you’re going to waste at
least one shot getting the ball back into play — maybe more than one if you
get a bad lie. Then you still have a longish shot to the green. If you miss the
green, you’re going to take at least 6 shots. Not good.
Now follow a better scenario. You hit your 3-wood from the tee safely down
the fairway. Then you hit your 5-wood, leaving the ball about 25 yards from
the green. All you have left is a simple little chip or pitch. Most times, you’ll
make no more than 5 on the hole. Indeed, you’ll nearly always have a putt for
a 4. I know most of you won’t do this, but it makes sense, doesn’t it?
All you have to do is pay attention to the layout of the hole and plan 
accordingly.
Strategy 3: Play three easy shots
The par-5 hole is long, just over 500 yards (see Figure 13-7). Your first inclina-
tion is again to reach for your driver. Most of the time, that’s probably the
correct play — but not always. Look at this hole. You can break it down
into three relatively easy shots with the same club. Say you hit your 4-iron
170 yards. Three shots can put you on the green. To me, breaking down the
hole is easier for the beginning player than trying to squeeze every possible
yard out of the driver and getting into trouble. (I know you gorillas out there
won’t consider this. But I had to do this as a disclaimer.)
No law of golf says that you must use your driver from the tee. If you don’t feel
comfortable with your driver, go with your 3-wood. If your 3-wood doesn’t
feel right, go to the 5-wood. And if you still aren’t happy, try your 3-iron or a
hybrid club. Don’t hit until you’re confident that you can hit the ball into the
fairway with the club that’s in your hands. I’d rather be 200 yards from the
tee and in the fairway than 250 yards out in the rough. If you don’t believe me,
try this test. Every time you miss a fairway from the tee, pick your ball up and
drop it 15 yards farther back — but in the middle of the fairway. Then play
from there. Bet you’ll shoot anywhere from 5 to 10 shots fewer than normal
for 18 holes. In other words, it’s better to be in a spot where you can hit the
ball cleanly than in a tough spot — even if the clean shot is longer.

Know your strengths and weaknesses
To really employ good strategy on the golf course, you have to know your
strengths and weaknesses. For example, on the par-4 hole described earlier
in this chapter (see “Strategy 2: Think before you drive”), a really accurate
driver of the ball could take the chance and try to hit the ball into the narrow
gap. She’s playing to her strength.
But how do you find out where your pluses and minuses are? Simple. All you
have to do is keep a close record of your rounds over a period of time. By a
close record, I don’t simply mean your score on each hole. You have to break
down the numbers a bit more than that.
Look at the score card in Figure 13-8, where John has marked his score in
detail. You can see how many fairways he hit. How many times he hit the
green. And how many putts he took on each green.
If John tracks these things over, say, ten rounds, trends soon appear. Assume
that this round is typical for John. Clearly, John isn’t a very good putter. Forty-
two putts for 18 holes is poor by any standard, especially when he isn’t hitting
that many greens — only one in three. If John were hitting 12 or 13 greens,
you’d expect more putts because he’d often be near the edge of the green.
But this card tells another story. John’s missing a lot of greens and taking a
lot of putts. So either his chipping and pitching are very bad, or his putting is
letting him down. Probably the latter.
On the other hand, John isn’t a bad driver, at least in terms of accuracy. He’s
hitting more than half the fairways. So, at least in the short term, John needs
to work on his short game and putting.
Keep a record of your scores that details various aspects of your game. You’ll
soon know which part (or parts) of your game need some work.
Beat the first-tee jitters
The opening shot of any round is often the most stressful. You’re not into your
round yet. Even the practice shots that you may have hit aren’t the real thing.
And people are nearly always around when you hit that first shot. If you’re
like most golfers, you’ll be intimidated by even the thought of striking a ball
in full view of the public.
How a player reacts to first-tee jitters is an individual thing. You just have to
get out there and do it and see what happens. Common symptoms: Blurred
vision. A desire to get this over and done with as soon as possible. Loss of
reason.
228
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

The most common mistake, however, is doing everything twice as fast as you
normally would. By everything, I mean looking down the fairway, standing up
to the ball, swinging — the lot. Your increased pace is due to the misguided
notion that if you get this swing over with really quickly, no one will see it. It’s
the hit-it-and-go syndrome, and you should avoid it.
Figure 13-8:

record of
your rounds

and weak-
nesses.
229
Chapter 13: Ready, Set, Play!

I remember when my golf swing wasn’t where I wanted it to be. I had a bad
grip, a bad takeaway, a bad position at the top. I was never comfortable with
myself, so how could I be comfortable with others watching? I’d get up there,
hit the ball as soon as I could, and get out of the way. After I understood the
mechanics of my swing, I lost that dread. All of a sudden, I stood over the ball
as long as I wanted to. I thought about what I was doing, not about what others
were thinking. I wanted people to watch, to revel in the positions in my golf
swing, because they were good positions. I didn’t mind showing off.
Being overly concerned about your audience is really a social problem. Rather
than taking refuge in your pre-shot routine and whatever swing thought you
may be using, you’re thinking about what other people may be thinking. The
secret to overcoming this social problem is to immerse yourself in your rou-
tine. Forget all that outside stuff. Say, “Okay, I’m going to start behind the ball.
Then I’m going to look at my line, take five steps to the ball, swing the club
away to the inside and turn my shoulders.” Whatever you say to yourself, just
remember to focus internally, not externally.
230
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 
How to be cool on the course
When you show up at the course, it’s okay to be
a little late. If you’ve got a 9 a.m. tee time, get
there at about 8:30. Then your partners are start-
ing to panic a bit about where you are. Always
change your shoes while sitting on the trunk of
your car. That’s cool. Always have a carry bag,
never a pull cart. Pull carts aren’t cool. Get one
of those little bags with the prongs on to keep it
upright when you set it down. Very cool.
Never tie your shoelaces until you get to the tee.
On the tee, bend down to tie them while com-
plaining about all the things that hurt. Bursitis in
your right shoulder. That pesky tendonitis in your
left knee. The sore elbow you sustained while
carrying an old lady’s groceries. Whatever. Elicit
sympathy from your companions. Get up very
slowly. Adjust yourself. Grab your back. Then
get into stroke negotiations. . . .
What’s also very cool is having your own turn of
golfing phrase. Make up your own language.
Don’t say stuff like “wow” or “far out.” Keep your
talk underground. Use stuff that no one else can
understand. For example, Fairway Louie refers to
the local denizens of our golf course as “herds
of grazing hack,” because they’re always look-
ing for balls in the rough. If you come up with
some good stuff, everyone will start using your
language. It’s a domino effect.
At first, though, I’d recommend that you do more
listening than talking. It’s like when you go to a for-
eign country. You have to listen before you start
spouting off. Listen to how golfers express them-
selves during moments of elation, anger, and soli-
tude. After you pick up the lingo, you can add your
own touches to it. In golf terminology, there’s no
right or wrong as long as you don’t act like a geek.

Playing Games
The best format I know of for the beginning golfer is a scramble. In that format,
you’re usually part of a team of four. Everyone tees off. Then you pick the
best of the four shots. Then everyone plays another shot from where that
“best shot” lies. And so on. A scramble is great for beginners because you
have less pressure to hit every shot well. You can lean on your partners a bit.
Plus, you get to watch better players up close. And you get to experience some
of the game’s camaraderie. Scrambles are typically full of rooting, cheering,
and high-fives. In short, they’re a lot of fun.
You can also play in games where the format is stableford. In this game,
the scoring is by points rather than strokes. You get one point for a bogey
(score of one over par) on each hole; two points for a par; three for a birdie
(one under par); and four points for an eagle (two under par). Thus, a round
in which you par every hole reaps you 36 points. The great thing is that in a
stableford, you don’t have to complete every hole. You can take your 9s and
10s without irreparably damaging your score. You simply don’t get any points
for a hole in which you take more than a bogey. That’s with your handicap
strokes deducted, of course. (For more on golf handicapping, see the next
chapter.)
After you’ve played for a while, however, you may find that you play most of
your golf with three companions. That’s known as a foursome in the United
States (a four-ball elsewhere). The format is simple. You split into two teams
of two and play what is known as a best-ball game. That is, the best score on
each team on each hole counts as the score for that team. For example, if
we’re partners and you make a 5 on the first hole and I make a 4, then our
team scores a 4 for the hole.
Keeping Score
Don’t get too wrapped up in how many shots you’re taking to play a round,
at least at first. For many golfers, the score doesn’t mean that much anyway.
Most of the guys I grew up with never kept score. That’s because they were
always playing a match against another player or team. In a match like that,
all that matters is how you compare with your opponents. It’s never “me against
the course.” It’s always “me against you.” So if I’m having a really bad hole, I
simply concede it to you and then move on to the next one.
231
Chapter 13: Ready, Set, Play!

Believe me, that’s a totally different game from the one that you see the pros
playing on TV every week. For them, every shot is vital — the difference
between making the cut or not, or finishing in or out of the big money.
That’s why the pro game is better left to the pros.
Practicing
It’s amazing, but nearly half of high-handicap golfers don’t practice. Are you
one of them? You can’t expect to improve if you don’t put some time in. Now,
I can already hear you whining, “I don’t have the time!” Well, stop your grip-
ing, because I made it easy for you. I put together a sample practice schedule
that you can easily work into your weekly routine. You may want to tone it
down at the office — it looks bad if your boss walks in while you’re practicing
your putting — although you may be able to make use of all the time you
spend on those long conference calls.
Practice can be fun. You can modify the schedule to fit your goals and your
playing level. Now, if you don’t want to take strokes off your game, skip this
part, but if you’re a weekend warrior who wants to improve, follow this quick
road map to success:
 Practice your swing whenever possible. You can practice most of the
suggestions in Part II in your basement, living room, or backyard. Place
old clubs in various locations around your house so that it’s convenient
to swing when the spirit (or schedule) moves you.
 Make imaginary swings in front of a mirror or window with your arms
and hands in the proper position (see Part II). If you don’t have a club
handy, that’s okay. Visualize and feel the correct position.
 Grip a club when you watch television — you’re not doing anything
else! Try swinging a club during a commercial — unless it’s one of my
commercials. In that case, put your club down and turn up the volume.
 Build a practice area in your house or office where you can easily work
on your short game. Use those plastic practice balls. Set up a small obsta-
cle course in your yard. (Your kids can help you with this part.)
 Where and when possible, hit a bucket of balls during lunch. If it’s a
hot day in July, you may want to hit the showers before you head back
to the office.
Here’s a sample practice schedule:
 Monday: Health-club workout (1 hour); putt on rug (15 minutes)
 Tuesday: Swing a club at home in front of a mirror or window (30 minutes)
 Wednesday: Health-club workout (1 hour); read a golf magazine or golf
book or watch a golf video or DVD (30 minutes)

Tips for seniors
Now that I’m on the senior tour, I get a chance
to tee it up with some of the same guys who
used to beat the pants off me on the PGA Tour. I
still love to play, but I realize that, as I age, my
game will change. I can deal with it. We all have
to. If you’ve become a senior golfer since the
last edition of this book came out, or if you’re
taking up the game for the first time, you need
to know some things to keep your game young.
As you may be finding out already (or will find out
soon enough), you just don’t hit the ball as far as
you used to. There are four basic reasons for this:
 Poor posture: Bad posture — often from
wearing bifocals — stops you from turning
properly. Be careful how you hold your head,
and keep it off your chest. Maintain good
posture by standing in front of a full-length
mirror and holding a club out in front of you.
Continue looking in the mirror as you lower
the club into the hitting position. Don’t let
your head tilt or move forward. When you
master this technique, you’ll be able to make
that turn and swing your arms.
 Lack of rotation on your backswing: You
probably aren’t turning your hips and shoul-
ders enough on the backswing. You can
increase your range of motion by increasing
your flexibility. See Chapter 4 for stretching
exercises that can help. Then review the ele-
ments of the swing in Chapters 6 and 7, get
out to the range, and work out those kinks.
 Decrease in strength: As you grow older, you
lose strength in your hands and forearms,
which makes it harder to hold your wrists in
the proper position on the downswing. This
weakness reduces the speed at which the
club strikes the ball. Simple drills to combat
loss of strength include squeezing a tennis
ball, doing forearm curls with light barbells,
and Harvey Penick’s drill: Swing a club back
and forth like a scythe 20 or 30 times a day.
I don’t recommend doing this one anywhere
near the old Ming vase.
 Lack of rotation in the follow-through: You
may be so intent on hitting the ball that you’re
not swinging through to the other side. This
causes the club to stop 3 or 4 feet beyond the
ball and the arms to stop somewhere around
your chest, with your belt buckle pointing to
the right of your target. As you can imagine,
this type of swing will not result in a pretty
shot. The ball will fly to the right and be, well,
weak. To correct such a problem, repeat
this drill each day until it feels natural: While
looking in a full-length mirror, go to the top
of your backswing (see Chapter 6) and then
mirror-image that position on the follow-
through. Your belt buckle should always
face to the left of your target. To make this
happen, you must transfer 90 percent of your
weight from your right foot to your left foot.
I can’t stress this enough: If you’re not on some
kind of exercise program, get on one (see Chap-
ter 4). Consult your local golf pro for suggestions,
too. A good program coupled with a stretching
routine will improve your flexibility and strength —
and your golf game. It will benefit your life as well.

Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

G
olf is not a game lacking in structure. In fact, it is rife with rules of play,
rules of etiquette, and rules of scoring. You may never master all the
intricacies of these rules, but you should familiarize yourself with some of
the more important ones.
Blimey, It’s a Stymie: The 
Ancient Rules of Golf
The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers devised the original 13Rules
of Golf in 1744, over a wee dram (whisky) or 12, no doubt. Anyway, the Rules
are worth recounting in this chapter, to show you how little the Rules of Golf
have changed over the centuries.
1. You must tee your ball within a club’s length of the hole.
2. Your tee must be upon the ground.
3. You are not to change the ball which you strike off the tee.
4. You are not to remove any stones, bones, or any break club, for the sake
of playing your ball. Except upon the fair green, and that’s only within a
club’s length of your ball.
5. If your ball comes among watter, or any watery filth, you are at liberty to
take out your ball and bringing it behind the hazard and teeing it, you may
play it with any club and allow your adversary a stroke, for so getting out
your ball.

6. If your balls be found anywhere touching one another you are to lift the
first ball, till you play the last.
7. At holling, you are to play honestly for the hole, and not to play upon
your adversary’s ball, not lying in your way to the hole.
8. If you should lose your ball, by its being taken up, or any other way you
are to go back to the spot, where you struck last, and drop another ball,
and allow your adversary a stroke for the misfortune.
9. No man at holling his ball, is to be allowed, to mark his way to the hole
with his club or any thing else.
10. If a ball be stopp’d by any person, horse, dog, or any thing else, the ball
so stopp’d must be played where it lyes.
11. If you draw your club, in order to strike and proceed so far in the stroke,
as to be bringing down your club; if then, your club shall break, in any
way, it is to be counted a stroke.
12. He whose ball lyes farthest from the hole is obliged to play first.
13. Neither trench, ditch or dyke, made for the preservation of the links, nor
the scholar’s holes or the soldier’s lines, shall be counted a hazard. But
the ball is to be taken out, teed and play’d with any iron club.
As you can tell from the language and terms used in 1744, these rules were
designed for match play (see “Match play,” later in this chapter). My particu-
lar favorite is Rule 6. It wasn’t that long before the rule was redefined from
“touching” to “within 6 inches” — which in turn led to the stymie rule. The
stymie has long since passed into legend, but it was a lot of fun. Basically,
stymie meant that whenever your opponent’s ball lay between your ball and the
hole, you couldn’t ask him to mark his ball. You had to find some way around
it. Usually, that meant chipping over his ball, which is great fun, especially if
you’re close to the hole.
Another rule I particularly like is the one stating that you could leave your
opponent’s ball where it lay if it was near the edge of the hole. As of the late
1960s, you could use such a situation to your advantage, with the other ball
acting as a backstop of sorts. Nothing could hack off your opponent more
than your ball going into the hole off his! Happy days!
The Rules Today
The Rules since those far-off early days have been refined countless times.
Take a look at a rulebook today (you can pick one up from almost any profes-
sional’s shop, or order one directly from the United States Golf Association),
and you’ll find a seemingly endless list of clauses and subclauses — all of
which make the game sound very difficult and complicated.
236
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

In my opinion, the Rules are too complex. For a smart, enjoyable look at them,
pick up a copy of Golf Rules & Etiquette For Dummies, by John Steinbreder.
There’s also an excellent book by Jeffrey S. Kuhn and Bryan A. Garner, The
Rules of Golf in Plain English. And if you’re not ready to memorize those two
tomes, you can get by with about a dozen simple rules. In fact, common
sense can help, too. You won’t go too far wrong on the course if you:
 Play the course as you find it.
 Play the ball as it lies.
 If you can’t do either of those things, do what’s fair.
To demonstrate just how crazy the Rules of Golf can get and how easy it is to
commit an infraction, look at the cases of Craig Stadler and Paul Azinger.
You may remember the Stadler case. Craig was playing the 14th hole at
Torrey Pines in San Diego during a PGA Tour event. Because his ball was
under a tree, he used a towel to kneel down as he hit the ball out because
he didn’t want to get his pants dirty.
That sounds harmless enough, doesn’t it? Think again. Some smart guy out
there in TV land was watching all this (the next day, no less) and thought he
was part of a new game show: You Make the Ruling. He called the PGA Tour
and said that Stadler was guilty of “building a stance.” By kneeling on top of
something, even a towel, Stadler was technically changing his shot, breaking
Rule 13-3 (a player is entitled to place his feet firmly in taking his stance, but
he shall not build his stance).
The officials had no option but to agree, so Craig was disqualified for signing
the wrong score card — 24 hours after the fact. Technically, an event isn’t
over until the competitors have completed 72 holes. At the time that Craig’s
rules infraction came to light, he had played only 54 holes. Madness! Stadler
clearly had no intent to gain advantage. But it was adios, Craig.
The same sort of thing happened with Paul Azinger. At the Doral tournament
in Florida in 1996, Azinger played a shot from inside the edge of the lake on
the final hole. Just before he started his swing, he flicked a rock out of the
way while taking his stance. Cue the Rules police. Another phone call got
Azinger thrown out for “moving loose impediments in a hazard.” Common
sense and the Rules parted company again.
Another incident occurred at the LPGA’s Samsung World Championship in
2005, when Michelle Wie took a drop several inches closer to the hole than
allowed. A Sports Illustrated writer noticed the infraction, and Michelle was
disqualified — in her first event as a professional!
237
Chapter 14: Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

In all three cases, the Rules of Golf were violated. The players were not cheating,
however; they broke the Rules accidentally. And what got them thrown out
of those tournaments were not the original infractions, but signing incorrect
score cards.
Anyway, the point is that although the Rules of Golf are designed to help you,
they can be a minefield. Watch where you step!
Marking a score card
Score cards can be a little daunting when you first look at them (see Figure
14-1). All those numbers and little boxes. But fear not — first impressions
can be misleading. Keeping score is actually simpler than it looks.

Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 
Ten rules you need to know
By Mike Shea, PGA Tour Rules Official
Rule 1: You must play the same ball from the
teeing ground into the hole. Change only when
the rules allow.
Rule 3-2: You must hole out on each hole. If you
don’t, you don’t have a score and are thus dis-
qualified.
Rule 6-5: You are responsible for playing your
own ball. Put an identification mark on it.
Rule 13: You must play the ball as it lies.
Rule 13-4: When your ball is in a hazard, whether
a bunker or a water hazard, you cannot touch
the ground or water in the hazard with your club
before impact.
Rule 16: You cannot improve the line of a putt
before your stroke by repairing marks made by
the spikes on players’ shoes.
Rule 24: Obstructions are anything artificial.
Some are moveable. Others are not, so you
must drop your ball within one club length of
your nearest point of relief — no penalty.
Rule 26: If your ball is lost in a water hazard, you
can drop another behind the hazard, keeping
the point where the ball last crossed the hazard
between you and the hole — with a one-stroke
penalty.
Rule 27: If you lose your ball anywhere other
than in a hazard, return to where you hit your
previous shot and hit another — with a one-
stroke penalty.
Rule 28: If your ball is unplayable, you have three
options (each carries a one-stroke penalty):
 Play from where you hit your last shot.
 Drop within two club lengths of where your
ball is now, no closer to the hole.
 Keep the point where the ball is between
you and the hole and drop your ball on that
line. You can go back as far as you want.

Say your handicap is 9 and mine is 14. That means you’re going to give me
5 strokes over the course of the round. I get those strokes at the holes rated
the most difficult. That’s logical. And equally logical is the fact that these holes
are handicapped 1 through 5. So mark those stroke holes before you begin.
(I discuss scoring and handicaps later in this chapter.)
Figure 14-1:
Marking
your card.
239
Chapter 14: Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

After the match has begun, keep track of the score with simple pluses or
minuses in a spare row of boxes.
In stroke or medal play, you’re expected to keep and score your playing com-
panion’s card. His name will be at the top, his handicap in the box at the
bottom of the card. All you have to do is record his score for each hole in the
box provided. You don’t even have to add it up.
Teeing up
You must tee up between the markers, not in front of them, and no more than
two club lengths behind them (see Figure 14-2). If you tee off outside this
area, you get a two-shot penalty in stroke play, and in match play, you must
replay your shot from the teeing area. (See the “Stroke play” and “Match play”
sections, later in this chapter, for more differences between the two.)
You don’t have to stand within the teeing area; your feet can be outside it.
This is useful to know when the only piece of level ground is outside the
teeing area or if the hole is a sharp dogleg. You can give yourself a better
angle by teeing up wide (standing outside the teeing area).
You don’t have to tee up your ball
right between the markers; you can
go back as much as two club lengths.

you think.

Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

Finding a lost ball
At this stage of your life, you’re going to hit more than your fair share of errant
shots. Some of those are going to finish in spots where finding the ball is a
little tricky. And sometimes you won’t find the ball at all.
If you can’t find the ball in the five minutes you’re allowed, you have to return
to the tee or to the point where you last hit the ball and play another ball.
With penalty, stroke, and distance, you’ll be hitting 3 off the tee. One way to
avoid having to walk all the way back to the tee after failing to find your ball
is to hit a provisional ball as soon as you think that the first one may be lost.
Then if you can’t find the first ball, play the second ball. Be sure, however, to
announce to your playing partners that you’re playing a provisional ball. If
you don’t, you must play the second ball — with the penalty — even if you
find the first ball.
How can you keep lost balls to a minimum? First, when your wild shot is in
midair, watch it like a hawk. If you don’t, you won’t have any idea where it
went. Now you’re probably thinking that sounds pretty obvious, but not watch-
ing the shot is perhaps the number-one reason (after bad technique) why balls
get lost. Temper gets the better of too many players. They’re too busy slamming
the club into the ground to watch where the ball goes. Don’t make that mistake.
Pay attention when the ball lands, too. Give yourself a reference — like a
tree — near the landing area. You should also put an identifying mark on
your ball before you begin play so you can be sure that the ball you find is
the one you hit.
Looking for a ball is a much-neglected art form. I see people wandering aim-
lessly, going over the same spot time after time. Be systematic. Walk back and
forth without retracing your steps. Your chances of finding the ball are much
greater that way.
You have five minutes to look for a lost ball from the moment you start
to search. Time yourself. Even if you find the ball after five minutes have
elapsed, you still have to go back to the spot you played from to hit another
ball. Them’s the rules.
Dropping a ball
There will be times when you have to pick up your ball and drop it. Every golf
course has places that allow you to take a free drop. A cart path is one — you
241
Chapter 14: Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

can move your ball away from the path with no penalty. Casual water (such as
a puddle) is another. If you find yourself in this position, follow this routine:
1. Lift and clean your ball.
2. Find the nearest spot where you have complete relief from the prob-
lem and mark that spot with a tee.
You not only have to get the ball away from the obstruction, but your
feet as well. So find the spot where your feet are clear of the obstruction
and then determine where the clubhead would be if you hit from there.
This is the spot you want to mark. The spot you choose cannot be closer
to the hole.
3. Measure one club length from that mark.
4. Now drop the ball.
Stand tall, holding the ball at shoulder height and at arm’s length, as
shown in Figure 14-3. Let the ball drop vertically. You aren’t allowed to
“spin” the ball into a more favorable spot. Where you drop depends on
what rule applies — just be sure that the ball doesn’t end up nearer the
hole than it was when you picked it up. If it does, you have to pick up
the ball and drop it again.
How you drop the ball makes no difference; however, you always have to stand
upright when dropping. I once had to drop my ball in a bunker where the
sand was wet. The ball was obviously going to plug when it landed (that is,
get buried in the sand), so I asked whether I could lie down to drop it. The
answer was negative. Oh, well. . . .
Taking advice
Advice has two sides. First, you cannot either give advice to or receive advice
from anyone other than your caddie. That means you can’t ask your playing
companion what club he or she hit. Neither can you say anything that may
help in the playing of his or her next stroke.
This rule is a tough one, and even the best have been caught breaking it. In
the 1971 Ryder Cup matches in St. Louis, Arnold Palmer was playing Bernard
Gallacher of Scotland. Palmer hit a lovely shot onto a par-3, whereupon
Gallacher’s caddie said, “Great shot, Arnie. What club did you hit?” Arnold,
being Arnold, told him. Gallacher was unaware of the exchange, but the ref-
eree heard it. Palmer, despite his own protestations, was awarded the hole.
That was in match play; in stroke play, it’s a 2-shot penalty. So take care!
242

Second, you’re going to find yourself playing with people, lots of people, who
think of themselves as experts on every aspect of the golf swing. These know-
it-alls usually mean well, but they’re dangerous to your golfing health. Ignore
them. Or, if that proves too difficult, listen, smile politely, and then go about
your business as if they had never uttered a word.
First, find the spot where your
feet are clear of the obstruction.
You get one more club length from there.
Now drop your ball.

Etiquette: How to Play the Right Way
In golf, unlike almost any of the trash-talking sports you can watch on TV,
sportsmanship is paramount. Golf is an easy game to cheat at, so every
player is on his or her honor. But there’s more to it than that. Golf has its
own code of etiquette: semiofficial “rules” of courtesy that every player is
expected to follow. Here are the main things you need to know:
 Don’t talk while someone is playing a stroke. Give your partners time and
silence while they’re analyzing the situation, making their practice swings,
and actually making their swings for real. Don’t stand near them or move
about, either, especially when you’re on the greens. Stay out of their
peripheral vision while they’re putting. Don’t stand near the hole or walk
between your partner’s ball and the hole. Even be mindful of your shadow.
The line of a putt — the path it must follow to the hole — is holy ground.
The key is being aware of your companions’ — and their golf balls’ —
whereabouts and temperament. Easygoing types may not mind if you
gab away while they’re choosing a club, but that isn’t true for everyone.
If in doubt, stand still and shut up. If you’re a problem more than once,
you’ll be told about it.
 Be ready to play when it’s your turn — when your ball lies farthest
from the hole. Make your decisions while you’re walking to your ball or
while waiting for someone else to play. Be ready to play. And when it’s
your turn to hit, do so without delay. You don’t have to rush; just get on
with it.
 The honor (that is, the first shot) on a given tee goes to the player
with the lowest score on the previous hole. If that hole was tied, the
player with the lowest score on the hole before that is said to be up and
retains the honor. In other words, you have the honor until you lose it.
 Make sure everyone in your foursome is behind you when you hit.
You’re not going to hit every shot where you’re aiming it. If in doubt,
wait for your playing partners to get out of your line of play. The same is
true for the group in front; wait until they are well out of range before
you hit. Even if it would take a career shot for you to reach them, wait.
Lawyers love golfers who ignore this rule of thumb.
 Pay attention to the group behind you, too. Are they waiting for you on
every shot? Is there a gap between you and the group ahead of you? If the
answer to either or both is yes, step aside and invite the group behind
you to play through. This is no reflection on your ability. All it means is
that the group behind plays faster than you do.
The best and most timesaving place to let a group behind play through is
at a par-3 (it’s the shortest hole and, therefore, the quickest way of play-
ing through). After hitting your ball onto the green, mark it, and wave to
them to play. Stand off to the side of the green as they hit. After they’ve
all hit, replace your ball and putt out. Then let them go. Simple, isn’t it?
244
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

Sadly, you’re likely to see this piece of basic good manners abused time
and again by players who don’t know any better and have no place on a
golf course. Ignore them. Do what’s right. Stepping aside makes your round
more enjoyable. Think about it. Who likes to ruin someone else’s day?
Give your ego a rest and let them through.
 Help out the greenskeeper. A busy golf course takes a lot of a pounding
over a day’s play — all those balls landing on greens, feet walking through
bunkers, and divots of earth flying through the air. Do your bit for the
golf course. Repair any ball marks you see on the greens. (You can use
your tee or a special tool called a divot fixer, which costs about a dollar
in the pro shop.)
Here’s how to repair ball marks: Stick the repair tool in the green around
the perimeter of the indentation. Start at the rear. Gently lift the com-
pacted dirt. Replace any loose pieces of grass or turf in the center of the
hole. Then take your putter and tap down the raised turf until it’s level
again (see Figure 14-4). You can repair ball marks either before or after
you putt. It’s a good habit to have.
Finally, smooth out or rake any footprints in bunkers, as shown in Fig-
ure 14-5 (but only after you play out). And replace any divots you find
on the fairways and tees.
 If you must play in a golf cart (take my advice and walk if you can),
park it well away from greens, tees, and bunkers. To speed up play,
you should park on the side of the green nearest the next tee. The same
is true if you’re carrying your bag. Don’t set it down near any of the
aforementioned, but do leave it in a spot on the way to the next tee.
 Leave the green as soon as everyone has finished putting. You’ll see
this a lot, and after a while it’ll drive you crazy. You’re ready to play your
approach shot to the green, and the people in front are crowding around
the hole marking their cards. That’s poor etiquette on two counts: It delays
play, and the last thing the greenskeeper wants is a lot of footprints around
the cup. Mark your card on the way to the next tee.
245

Ten things to say when you hit a bad shot
 I wasn’t loose.
 I looked up.
 I just had a lesson, and the pro screwed
me up.
 I borrowed these clubs.
 These new shoes are hurting my feet.
 This new glove doesn’t fit.
 I had a bad lie.
 The club slipped.
 I can’t play well when the dew point is this
high.
 The sun was in my eyes.

The Handicap System
If you, as a beginner, are completing 18-hole rounds in less than 80 shots, you’re
either a cheat or the next Jack Nicklaus or Annika Sorenstam. In all probabil-
ity, you are neither, which makes it likely that your scores are considerably
higher than par. Enter the handicap system.

246
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

The United States Golf Association constructed the handicap system to level
the playing field for everyone. The association has an esoteric system of
“course rating” and something called “slope” to help them compute exactly
how many strokes everyone should get. In all my years in golf, I have yet to
meet anyone who either understands or can explain how the course rating
and slope are computed, so I’m not going to try. Be like everyone else —
accept both and go with the flow.
The handicap system is one reason I think that golf is the best of all games.
Handicapping allows any two players, whatever their level of play, to go out
and have an enjoyable — and competitive — game together. Try to compete
on, say, a tennis court. I can’t go out with Andre Agassi and have any fun at
all. Neither can he. The disparity in our ability levels makes competitive play
impossible. Not so with golf.
Getting a handicap
If you’ve never played golf before, you won’t have a handicap yet. Don’t
worry — you’ve got plenty of time. When you can consistently hit the ball at
least 150 yards with a driver, you’re ready to play a full 18-hole round of golf.
When you reach the stage where you can hit the ball a decent distance on the
range, you’re ready to do the same on a real golf course. You want to test your-
self and give your progress a number. Make that two numbers: your score and
your handicap.
The first thing you need to do is keep score. Get a golfer friend to accompany
you in a round of 18 holes. This person must keep score and sign your card at
the end of the round. To be valid, a card needs two signatures — your own
and that of the person you’re playing with. That way, all scores are clearly
valid, and corruption is kept to a minimum.
You need to play at least ten rounds before you’re eligible for a handicap. Don’t
ask why; those are the rules. Before you complete ten rounds, you’re in a kind
of cocoon from which you emerge as a beautiful, full-fledged, handicap golfer.
At first, your handicap will probably drop quite quickly. Most new golfers
improve by leaps and bounds at first. After that, improvement may continue,
but at a much slower pace.
Of course, the handicap system is easy to abuse, and some people do.
Interestingly, most abuse occurs when players want their handicaps to be
higher. They either fabricate high scores, or they don’t record their better
rounds so that their handicaps rise. Thus, they get more strokes from other
247
Chapter 14: Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

players in betting matches. A few golfers go the other way; they want a lower
handicap than they can realistically play to so that their scores look better.
Find these people with vanity handicaps and wager with them for everything
they own!
Don’t get too cynical, though. Any abuse of the system is thankfully confined
to a tiny minority of players, which is another reason why golf is such a great
game. Golfers can generally be trusted. The few cheats are soon identified
and ostracized.
Calculating your handicap
Okay, you’re wondering how you get a handicap, right? All you have to do is
hand in your scores at the course where you normally play. Then you’re off
and running. Your handicap at any one time is the average of the best 10 of
your previous 20 scores (see Figure 14-6). Technically it’s 96 percent of that
number, but let the math whizzes handle that wrinkle.
Your handicap fairly accurately reflects your current form because you must
record your score every time you go out. Most clubs and public facilities
make things easy for you. They have computers into which you feed your
scores. The program does all the work and updates your handicap.
Figure 14-6:
Your handi-
cap card.
248
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

You don’t have to be a member of a club to get a handicap. Many public facili-
ties have their own handicap computers. For a nominal fee, you can usually
get yourself an identification number and access to the software.
Suppose that your ten scores average out at exactly 100. In other words, for
your first ten rounds of golf, you hit 1,000 shots. If par for the 18-hole course
you played is 72, your average score is 28 over par. That figure, 28, is your
handicap.
Every time you play from then on, your handicap adjusts to account for your
most recent score. Suppose that your 11th round is a 96. That’s only 24 over
the par of 72. So your net score — your actual score minus your handicap —
is 68, 4 under that magic number of 72. That’s good.
Remember: The lower your score is, the better you’ve played. When you feed
that 96 into the handicap computer, you’ll probably find that your handicap
drops.
What your handicap means
In golf, the lower your handicap is, the better you are. Thus, if your handicap is
6 and mine is 10, you’re a better player than I. On average, four strokes better,
to be exact.
Assume that par for the 18-hole course we’re going to play is 72. You, as
someone with a handicap of 6, would be expected to play 18 holes in a total of
78 strokes, 6 more than par. I, on the other hand, being a 10-handicapper, would
on a normal day hit the ball 82 times, 10 more than par. Thus, your handicap
is the number of strokes over par you should take to play an 18-hole course.
When you’re just starting out, you don’t want to team up with three low-
handicap players. Play with golfers of your own ability at first. When you get
the hang of it, start playing with people who are better than you so that you
can learn from them.
How to Keep Score
Scoring is another great thing about golf. You can easily see how you’re doing
because your score is in black and white on the score card. Every course you
play has a score card. The score card tells you each hole’s length, its par, and
its rating relative to the other holes (see Figure 14-7).
249
Chapter 14: Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

The relationship of the holes is important when you’re playing a head-to-head
match. Say I have to give you 11 shots over 18 holes. In other words, on 11 holes
Figure 14-7:
Keeping
score.
250
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

during our round, you get to subtract one shot from your score. The obvious
question is, “Which holes?” The card answers that question. You get your shots
on the holes rated 1 through 11. These holes, in the opinion of the club com-
mittee, are the hardest 11 holes on the course. The number-one-rated hole is
the toughest, and the number 18–rated hole is the easiest.
Although you have to report your score every time you set foot on the golf
course (stroke play), most of your golf will typically be matches against others
(match play), which is why each hole’s rating is important.
Match play
Match play and stroke play have slightly different rules. In match play, you
don’t have to write down any score. The only thing that matters is the state
of the game between you and your opponent.
The score is recorded as holes up or holes down. For example, say my score
on the first hole was 4, and your score was 5 and you received no strokes on
that hole. I’m now one up. Because each hole is a separate entity, you don’t
need to write down your actual score; you simply count the number of holes
you’ve won or lost. In fact, if you’re having a particularly bad time on a given
hole, you can even pick up your ball and concede the hole. All you lose is
that hole. Everything starts fresh on the next tee. Such a head-to-head match
ends when one player is more holes up than the number of holes remaining.
Thus, matches can be won by scores of “four and three.” All that means is
that one player was four holes ahead with only three left, the match finishing
on the 15th green.
Stroke play
Stroke play is different. It’s strictly card-and-pencil stuff. Now you’re playing
against everyone else in the field — or against that elusive standard, par —
not just your playing companion. All you do is count one stroke each time
you swing at the ball. If it takes you five strokes to play the first hole, you
write 5 on your card for that hole. You don’t record your own score, though.
The card in your pocket has your playing companion’s name on it. You keep
his score, and he keeps yours. (You may keep your own score as well, but
your playing partner keeps your official score.) At the end of the round, he
signs his name to your card and gives it to you; you do the same with his
card. After you’ve checked your score for each hole, you also sign your card.
Then, if you’re in an official tournament, you hand your card to the scorers.
If you’re playing a casual round, you record your score on the computer.
251
Chapter 14: Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

Take care when checking your card. One Rules of Golf quirk is that you’re
responsible for the accuracy of the score recorded under your name for each
hole — your companion isn’t. Any mistakes are deemed to have been made
by you, not him. And you can’t change a mistake later, even if you have wit-
nesses. Take the case of Roberto DeVicenzo at the 1968 Masters. Millions of
spectators and TV viewers saw him make a birdie 3 on the 17th hole in the
final round. But the man marking his card, Tommy Aaron, mistakenly marked
a 4. Checking his score after the round, DeVicenzo failed to notice the error
and signed his card. The mistake cost him the chance of victory in a playoff
with Bob Goalby. DeVicenzo had to accept a score one higher than he actu-
ally shot and lost by that one stroke. Tragic.
DeVicenzo’s mistake illustrates what can happen when the score on your
card is higher than the one you actually made on the hole. You’re simply
stuck with that score. If the opposite is the case and the score on the card
is lower than it should be, the result is even worse: You’re disqualified.
One last thing: Don’t worry about the addition on your card. You aren’t respon-
sible for that part. As long as the numbers opposite each hole are correct,
you’re in the clear.
Penalty Shots
Penalty shots are an unfortunate part of every golfer’s life. Sooner or later,
you’re going to incur a penalty shot or shots. I can’t cover all the possible
penalty situations in this book, but in the following sections I run you
through the most common.
Out-of-bounds
Out-of-bounds is the term used when you hit your ball to a spot outside the
confines of the golf course — over a boundary fence, for example. Out-of-
bounds areas are usually marked with white stakes that are about 30 yards
apart. If you’re outside that line, you’re out-of-bounds (often abbreviated with
the dreaded initials “O.B.”).
Okay, so it’s happened; you’ve gone out-of-bounds. What are your options?
Limited, I’m afraid. First, you’re penalized stroke and distance. That means
you must drop another ball (or tee up if the shot you hit out-of-bounds was
from a tee) as near as possible to the spot you just played from. Say that shot
was your first on that hole. Your next shot will count as your third on that
hole. Count ’em:
252
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

 The shot you hit
 The stroke penalty
 The distance
So now you’re “playing three” from the same spot.
Unplayable lies
Inevitably, you’re going to hit a ball into a spot from which further progress is
impossible. In a bush. Against a wall. Even buried in a bunker.
When the unplayable lie happens (and you are the sole judge of whether you
can hit the ball), your situation dictates your options. In general, you have
three escape routes.
 You can pick up the ball and drop it — no nearer the hole — within two
club lengths (take your driver and place it end-to-end on the ground twice)
of the original spot under penalty of one shot.
 You can pick up the ball, walk back as far as you want, keeping that origi-
nal point between you and the hole, and then drop the ball. Again, it’s a
one-stroke penalty.
 You can return to the point where you hit the original shot. This option is
the last resort because you lose distance, as well as adding the penalty
shot. Believe me, there’s nothing worse than a long walk burdened with
a penalty stroke!
Water hazards
Water hazards are intimidating when you have to hit across one. You hear the
dreaded splash before too long. “Watery graves,” the English TV commentator
Henry Longhurst used to call these things.
Anyway, whenever you see yellow stakes, you know the pond/creek/lake in
question is a water hazard. If you hit into a water hazard, you may play the
ball as it lies (no penalty), or if the ball is unplayable, choose from these
options:
 Hit another ball from the spot you just hit from.
 Take the point where your ball crossed the water hazard and drop
another ball (you can go back as far as you want, keeping that point
between you and the hole).
You have a one-shot penalty in either case.
253
Chapter 14: Rules, Etiquette, and Scoring

Lateral water hazards
If you’re playing by the seaside, the beach is often termed a lateral water hazard.
Red stakes mean lateral. Your options are either to play the ball as it lies
(no penalty, but risky), or as follows, with a one-stroke penalty:
 Drop a ball at the point where the ball last crossed the boundary of the
hazard — within two club lengths, no nearer the hole.
 Drop a ball as near as possible to the spot on the opposite margin of the
water hazard, the same distance from the hole.
 Hit another ball from within two club lengths of the spot you just hit from.
 Take the point where the ball crossed the water hazard and drop another
ball as far back as you want, keeping that point between you and the hole.
Airballs: The dreaded whiff
Airballs happen early in the life of a beginner. You make a mighty swing and
miss the ball. The penalty? None, actually. But you must count that swing as
a stroke.
If you swing at a ball with intent to hit it, that’s a shot regardless of whether
you make contact. You can’t say, “That was a practice swing.” If you meant to
hit the ball, your swing counts as a stroke.
Airballs can be highly embarrassing, but they’re part of the journey of golf.

In This Chapter
 Avoiding hustles
 Doing the right thing on the course
 Playing with the pros
B
etting is a touchy subject. Being the type of game that it is, golf lends
itself to gambling. It probably won’t be long before you find yourself
playing for money. Oh, at first, the money won’t be much — if you have any
sense, that is. But after a while, the money games can get out of hand if you
let them.
Fortunately, there are rules of thumb for gambling on the course — and for
handling other tricky situations that every golfer is bound to face.
Wanna Bet?
In my experience, golfers come in two types: those who want a good, even
match and those who don’t. I recommend playing with the first group in your
early days. Those folks won’t take advantage of your inexperience. They want
a good, close match, so they’ll give you the shots you need to make a good
showing. The winner will be the one who plays better that day. Nothing
wrong with that, of course. If someone is to win, there has to be a loser —
and sometimes, that loser will be you.
Unfortunately, the nice people I just described can be hard to find. That
second group constitutes the vast majority of gambling golfers. They play
golf for one reason: to bet and win. They don’t play for the sunshine. They
don’t play for the exercise (unless getting in and out of a cart qualifies as
exercise). And they surely don’t play for relaxation. Most of them need clini-
cal psychologists and straitjackets. They play to gamble with their buddies
and beat them into bankruptcy.

The first tee
It’s often said in golf that most matches are won on the first tee — the arena
of negotiation, I call it. It’s here that bets are fought over and agreed upon.
The key is the number of strokes you’ll give or receive over the course of a
round.
Initially, you’ll be playing with people whose handicaps are lower than yours.
So you’re going to get strokes from them. Say your handicap is 30 and your
opponent’s is 18. That’s 12 strokes to you, right? Not if Mr. Cutthroat has his
way. He’ll argue that his wife just left him. Or that he hasn’t played in two
weeks because of his workload at the office. Or that his old football injury is
acting up again. In any case, he’ll try to cut your strokes down by at least
three. That, he figures, is the edge he needs to beat you.
It goes without saying that you either (a) nod sympathetically; or (b) spin
more tall tales than he just did. What you do not do is give up even a single
stroke. Not one.
If you must give strokes to a player with a higher handicap, never net the
strokes so that you’re playing with zero. For example, if your handicap is 12
and your opponent’s is 18, netting gives you 0 strokes and your opponent 6.
Take all your strokes, because they’ll be on the toughest holes.
Never play for more than you can afford to lose. Keep the bets small when
you’re a new golfer learning the gambling ropes in the big city. It’s a great
game to play and have fun with, but if you lose enough money that it starts to
hurt, the recreational aspects pale. Be careful and proceed at your own risk.
There’s a famous quote about pressure from Lee Trevino, in his early days
one of golf’s great hustlers. “Pressure,” he said, “is $5 on the front nine, $5 on
the back, and $5 for the 18 with $2 in your pocket.”
Nassaus, skins, junk, and other wagers
A nassau is a three-part bet (like the one Trevino was talking about): A given
amount is wagered on the front nine, the back nine and the total score. The
bet was named for New York’s Nassau Country Club, where it’s said to have
originated. It often leads to a press. That’s when you’re so far behind you con-
cede the bet and double it for the holes that remain. There’s even an aloha
press, in which you press everything on the last hole.
Another popular format is skins: Each golfer puts up a certain fee per hole 
($5 is common) that goes to the winner, but if two tie, all tie; the fee rolls over
until somebody wins a hole outright.
256
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

Many golfers add bets for greenies (anyone hitting the green in one shot wins a
predetermined sum from everyone else) or sandies (ditto for anyone who gets
from a bunker into the hole in two shots). Such wagers are called junk, but
everyone agrees they’re fun. You can add barkies — you win if you hit a tree
and still make par or better on a hole — or other bets of your own invention.
Giving putts
The green is one place where a little tactical planning can pay dividends. It’s
a fact of golf that no one, from a first-time beginner to the most famous pros,
likes short putts, especially when they mean something. For that reason
alone, you shouldn’t be too generous in conceding short putts to your oppo-
nents. Always ask yourself if you would fancy hitting the putt. If the answer is
“no” or even “not really,” say nothing and watch.
That’s the hard-nosed approach. If you’re playing a friendly round or you’re
with your boss, be a bit more generous. The demarcation line has long been
that anything “inside the leather” is “good.” That means any putt closer than
the length of the grip on your putter (or in some places, between the grip and
the clubhead) is deemed to be a “gimme” or unmissable. Such a policy is still
applicable today, although those long putters some players use have equally
long grips — so watch out!
I’ve looked at the two extremes in conceding — or not conceding — short
putts. But there’s a middle ground also. The great Walter Hagen was the
master of this, or so the story goes. “The Haig” was the best match player of
his day. In the 1920s, he won four PGA championships in succession at match
play. So he had to know a thing or two about psychology. One of his ploys
257
Chapter 15: Gamesmanship and Sportsmanship
Ten things to say when your partner or 
opponent hits a bad shot
 At least you’re dressing better.
 Never up, never in.
 You’ll get better on the back nine.
 At least we’re not playing for much money.
 Well, it’s a nice day, anyway.
 I never play well on the weekends, either.
 Does your spouse play?
 I have trouble with that shot, too.
 You should have warmed up more.
 That’s a hard shot with the dew point 
this low.

was to concede a few shortish putts early in the match. That way, two things
happened: His opponent got used to being given putts and, perhaps more
important, the opponent was deprived of the “practice” of knocking a few in.
Then, later in the round, old Walter wasn’t so generous. The opponent would
suddenly be faced with a knee-knocker, the sort of putt he hadn’t hit all day.
I don’t really recommend Walter’s strategy. You can lose friends in a hurry if
they miss that short one on the 17th. And your strategy may not work.
Remember: A short putt missed on the 3rd green counts the same as one on
the 17th or 18th.
Picking Partners
Again, you can make picking partners as cutthroat or as casual as you like. If
you’re just playing for fun or for a few dollars, who your partners are doesn’t
really matter. If you play with the same guys every time, everything will
pretty much even out in the end, anyway.
But if things are a little more serious, you need to put some thought into your
partners. Here are the rules I try to follow in “money” games:
 My partner always has a 1-iron in his bag.
 He has more than 37 tags hanging from his bag — preferably from
Pebble Beach, PGA West, Harbour Town, and other famous, difficult
courses.
 He has used the same putter since he was 5 years old.
 He’s gone if he tells me about his marital problems on the practice
range!
Match-Play Smarts
As you’ve probably guessed by now, match play generally involves a lot more
strategy than stroke play. Strict card-and-pencil golf has a simple premise:
Score the best you can. Match play is equally simple: Beat the other golfer.
But doing so requires more thought. Here are my match-play rules:
 Don’t go for too much early. Handing a couple of early holes to your
opponent only hurts your confidence and boosts the confidence of the
competition. So do risk it making a big number. Play conservatively at
first.
 Never lose your temper. Nothing gives your opponent more heart than
watching and listening as you lose your cool.
258
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

 Pay attention to where your opponent’s ball is at all times. Your oppo-
nent’s situation dictates your tactics on any given shot. For example, if
he’s deep in the woods, you may want to be less aggressive.
 Figure that your opponent will hole every putt he looks at. Then you
won’t be disappointed if he does make it. Of course, if he misses, you get
a boost.
 Watch your opponent. Watch how fast he walks, for example. If he’s
slow, go fast; if he’s fast, go slowly. Anything to break his natural rhythm.
 Try never to hit two bad shots in a row. Easier said than done, of
course!
 Never second-guess yourself. If you’re playing it safe, don’t suddenly get
aggressive halfway into your downswing. And if you’re going for it, really
do it. Even if you miss, you’ll feel better. Take it from me — someone
who has missed more than once!
 Only concede a hole when the situation is hopeless. Make your oppo-
nent win holes instead of losing them yourself. The more shots he has to
hit under pressure, the more likely he is to make a mistake.
Never Give Up
In the 1972 British Open at Muirfield, Lee Trevino and Tony Jacklin were tied
standing on the 17th tee in the final round. Distracted by a spectator, Trevino
hooked his drive on the par-5 into a deep bunker. Jacklin drove perfectly.
After splashing out only a few yards, Lee then hooked his third shot into
heavy rough to the left and short of the green. Jacklin hit his fairway wood
into the perfect spot, about 50 yards from the hole.
At that point, Trevino gave up. He quit. He told Jacklin that the championship
was all his and did everything but shake his hand right there. Trevino’s
fourth shot flew right over the green halfway up a grass bank. Jacklin hit a so-
so pitch to about 15 feet.
Barely glancing at the shot, Trevino then hit a lazy, give-up chip that rolled
right into the cup! Par! Jacklin then three-putted for a 6. Trevino won.
I relate this story to you because it is so unusual — quitters never win. Don’t
be a quitter. Be a grinder — that’s what golfers call a player who gives his all
on every shot.
259
Chapter 15: Gamesmanship and Sportsmanship

Playing with Your Boss
When playing with your boss (or with anybody), you want to do your best. If
you’re just starting to play this game, you don’t have to worry about beating
the boss and feeling bad. He or she has probably played golf a lot longer than
you have and just wants to get to know you on the course. The golf course is
a great place to find out a person’s true personality. The game leaves you psy-
chologically naked in front of your peers.
If your game develops and you become a very good player, you’re an asset to
your company, and your boss should recognize your potential as a represen-
tative of the company. Millions of dollars in business deals have been negoti-
ated on the golf course.
Play your best at all times and be helpful to people who don’t play as well as
you do. You’ll reap the benefits for many years to come.
260
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 
How to avoid a hustle
As a relatively new golfer, you’re going to be a
prime target for hustlers. They’ll figure you’re nei-
ther talented nor savvy enough to beat them. And
they’ll be right — at least until you’ve played a
while. So avoid them. Here’s what to look for:
 Does he have a 1-iron in his bag? If so, don’t
play him. Only good players can hit those
things. (And in these days when even good
players have traded long irons for hybrid
clubs, be suspicious of anyone with a 
2-iron, too.)
 Never bet with a stranger.
 If you do bet, make it a straightforward
nassau (front, back, 18 bet). Don’t get bam-
boozled with lots of side bets.
 If he uses a ball that isn’t new, say good-
bye. Bad players don’t have old balls; they
lose them too quickly.
 As legendary teacher Harvey Penick used
to say, “Beware of the golfer with a bad
grip.” Why? Because he’s found a way to
make it work.
 Another thing about the grip — look at your
opponent’s left hand. If he has calluses, he’s
either played or practiced a lot. Adios.
 If that left hand is less tan than the right, the
same applies. He’s spent a lot of time wear-
ing a golf glove.

261
Chapter 15: Gamesmanship and Sportsmanship
When golf is all business
Sure, golf is a game, but sometimes it’s also seri-
ous business. Corporate golf outings have
become an industry in themselves. And for every
official company event, countless informal four-
somes are getting together to schmooze outside
the office.
If you play golf, sooner or later a business round
is bound to happen to you. Maybe the chance to
do a little networking is why you took up golf in
the first place. So you need to know some basic
rules when you mix business banter with the
back nine; it’s not all fun and games. Protocol is
part of the puzzle.
 Don’t show off.Remember: Golf is business —
an extension of the workplace. You wouldn’t
yell and punch the air, showing up your boss
and co-workers in the office, so don’t do it on
the fairway either. By all means play your best,
but save the showboating for casual rounds
with your friends.
 Watch the raunchy humor. Sure, you want
everyone to have a good time. But unless
you know your partners’ attitudes and out-
looks well, you risk not only offending them
but losing their business, too.
 Don’t try to squeeze profit out of every
minute. At the very least, keep up the pre-
tense that you’re all out for good fun and
good company — even if your companions
couldn’t sink a putt to save their mother’s
mortgage.
 Let your group get settled into its game
before talking business. Never talk about
business before the 5th hole — or better
yet, the back nine.
 Be prepared to drop the topic or risk losing
the business. No matter how seriously busi-
nesspeople take their line of work, they may
be even more fanatical about their game of
golf — especially on that one difficult shot.
Let your feel of the individual dictate when
to lay off business conversation.
 Watch the wagers. You may choose to
accept bets in the interest of being a good
sport, but suggesting them is not wise. If you
lose the bet, be sure to do it gracefully —
and to pay up pronto. If you win, don’t gloat.
 Never, ever cheat or fudge your score in
any way. However tempting cheating may
be, it sends the wrong message. Do you
want potential business partners to see you
as dishonest — a corner-cutter or worse?
Hitting the links on a sunny day sure beats work-
ing in an office, and it’s a great way to get to
know the folks in your industry — and sometimes
that means some high-level folks, not just the
ones you run into at the water cooler. Believe me,
I’ve been to enough corporate outings to know
what a major business schmoozefest the links
can be. (Just to give you an idea, my smiling face
was at 41 business outings last year. Whew!) The
bottom line is, get out on the links and mingle
with the boss — it can do your career good. Just
remember what you’re there for. You’re not at
qualifying school for the PGA Tour.

Surviving a Pro-Am
I was sent off to war, a young man still slobbering from the fright. There
were going to be people wearing camouflaged plaid, shooting at me, toward
whom I had no ill will; would I be man enough to fight back? I was going to
learn a lesson about life; the cruel nature of this odyssey was upon me. I
was going to play in my first pro-am.
—Gary McCord, circa 1974, as he embarked without 
hesitation toward the first tee and certain death
There is a rite of passage in pro golf called a pro-am. This is the cornerstone
of our being. If you’re armed with a sizable amount of cash (around $5,000),
you can tee it up with Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, or Ernie Els and tell your
friends for the next 300 business lunches how you enthralled these guys with
your prowess on the links and your witty banter between shots. In no other
sport can a layman go on the playing field and get this close to the action —
except by streaking at a nationally televised game. The shortcomings of the
latter are obvious.
Pro-ams are played every Wednesday, or on the Champions Tour on
Wednesdays and Thursdays. Each team consists of four amateurs and a pro.
Corporations pay handsomely for the opportunity to put their names on tour-
naments and entertain their clients. This setup is unique in sports, and it’s
the pros’ duty to see that corporate clients have a good time and want to
come back for more.
Since 1998, there has been a pro-am for the budget-minded. Called the
Saturday Series, it pairs amateurs with pros who have missed the cut in the
current week’s PGA Tour event, on a course near that week’s tour venue.
Entry fees are often less than half that at traditional pro-ams. To find out
more about the Saturday Series, check out www.saturdayseries.com.
Much has been written about the attitudes of the tour players in these ubiqui-
tous Wednesday pro-ams. The difficulties in concentrating on the day before a
tournament while playing with nervous amateurs are many. However, no one
seems to offer the quivering victims any advice. I always try to imagine what it
would be like for me if I were plucked out of my comfort zone and thrust into
the spotlight — say, on the hardwood with Shaquille O’Neal or in the board-
room with Bill Gates — and told not to make an idiot of myself. The truth is
that neither Shaq nor Bill would expect me to be any good. I, on the other
hand, would still like to give a decent account of myself, or at least limit the
damage.
The first thing to keep in mind is that your pro requires one thing from you:
that you enjoy yourself. The reason we play for so much money these days is 
262
Part IV: Taking Your Game Public 

that you do enjoy the game, you do buy the equipment that you don’t need,
and you do love to watch us on television. So don’t be overawed: Chances are
you do something for a living that we would be completely useless at doing.
A good pro will always do his or her best to put you at ease on the 1st tee, so
when you make your first swing that makes contact with the planet 9 inches
behind the ball and induces significant seismographic readings, you can at
least have a laugh at it, too.
Here are my “Eight Steps to Pro-Am Heaven” — for pros and amateurs alike. 
A few do’s and don’ts of playing with a pro — a road map through the purga-
tory of the pro-am. I hope that these few guidelines help both you and your
pro enjoy the day.
Get a caddie
Having a caddie is the only way to play the pro-am game. You can walk free of
hindrance and have clubs handed to you clean and dry. If possible, get one 
of the tour caddies whose player isn’t in the pro-am. For $50 to $100, you can
have someone who is used to being screamed at and blamed for the weather,
the rate of inflation, and some of those hard-to-explain skin rashes.
Mind you, the caddie won’t be able to club you because you don’t know
which part of the club the ball is about to bounce off of. However, he or she
will be able to regale you with bizarre stories of “looper legends” in their
quest for immortality on the fairways of life. These tales are worth the price
of admission, and parental guidance is suggested.
Be ready to hit
You need to be ready to swing, even if it isn’t your turn. Discuss with your
partners the concept of ready golf before you tee off. This means forgetting
whose honor it is — if you’re ready, just go. Pro-am play is hideously slow at
the best of times, and your pro will really appreciate it if you make the effort
to keep things going.
Toss the cell phone
At the very least, turn it off. The surgical removal of a cellular phone from
certain regions of the anatomy is painful and, to the best of my knowledge, is
not covered under most health-insurance plans.
263
Chapter 15: Gamesmanship and Sportsmanship

Get a yardage book
And ask a tour caddie how to use a yardage book. Doing so will make the pro
very happy. Contribute to your pro’s mental health by being the first “ammy”
in the history of his or her pro-am career not to ask the question: “How far
have I got from here?” There are only a certain number of times in your adult
life that you can be asked this question before your spleen bursts. I am a
better person without mine.
If you’re out of the hole, pick up!
If you’re out of the hole, pick it up, ball in pocket. Rest the ammo. Holster the
bad boy. And be sure to tell your pro that you’ve done so. Not only will you
contribute to the pace of play, but you’ll also avoid the awkward situation of
having the pro wait, expecting you to hit, while you rummage around in your
bag looking for the source of that smell that has been emanating from there
since you let the kids play with your rain gear.
This tip doesn’t contradict the one earlier in this chapter, telling you to never
give up. You should not pick up your ball if there’s still a chance to help your
team. But the moment that chance disappears, pocket that ball. In a pro-am,
the only one thing worse than waiting around for no apparent reason is wait-
ing around for a very bad apparent reason — for example, somebody who’s
holing out for a 9, net 8.
Don’t sweat your score
And don’t be upset if your pro doesn’t know how your team stands.
Remember: It’s a Wednesday. He probably doesn’t even know his own score,
and, quite honestly, after the 26th pro-am of the year, he may not remember
what his gender is.
Watch your step
I know, you’re wearing soft spikes and it shouldn’t matter, but the tradition of
wandering on somebody’s line, regardless of what’s on the bottom of your
soles, is a slow dance with a hot temper. Be very, very mindful of the line of
your pro’s putt. Look at TV coverage of a golf tournament and see how
264

respectful the pros are of each other’s lines. Stepping on another pro’s line is
close to religious desecration in our sport. I’ve pulled a groin muscle trying
to mark my ball without stepping on the sacred line. But I think that, in my
career, I’ve excelled at acrobatic markings of the ball because I was excep-
tional at the game Twister during my formative years.
Simply ask the pro where his line is, and he’ll show you. If my ball is not in
another player’s line, I’ll leave it right next to the coin the entire time we’re
on the green so that my amateur partners know where my line is and (I hope)
avoid stepping on it.
Don’t coach the pro
Finally, if you’re still interested in playing this game with anybody ever again,
do not give the pro any advice on how to play the course, even if your family
has owned the property since the planet started to warm and you can
wander it in the dark without hitting anything. Trust me, he thinks he knows
more about it than you do just because he has his name on his bag.
It’s a question of knowing what to look for. Even giving the occasional line off
the tee can be dangerous because you don’t normally play two club lengths
from the back edge of the back tee. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard,
“Oops, I could have sworn you could carry that bunker!”

It is a medium that reaches the far corners of humanity; its video displays
teach and formulate a way of life. No singular invention has influenced our
lives and dictated our roles in society, whether good or bad, as much as
television. That is way too much pressure for me; please turn me off.

class at Lincoln Elementary School in 1959 after he was 
voted “Most Likely to Do the Weather Report Someday”
T
he year was 1986, and my professional goals and aspirations were in 
need of Dr. Kevorkian. “Limited success” was a nice way of describing my
playing career. The tour was a vast, empty wasteland of setbacks and spent
money. I was serving out the rest of my sentence with no chance of parole.
Golf sucks.
As I boarded my airplane for Columbus, Ohio, nothing really was on my mind
other than the two fat vacuum-cleaner salesmen I was going to be sitting
between in the coach section. I was in my customary hesitant gaze when I
was awakened by harsh criticism coming from the first-class section. It was
the CBS crew that does golf, already enjoying the amenities of first class
(although in a plastic cup) before takeoff.
Frank Chirkinian, the executive producer and director for CBS at the time, 
Pat Summerall, Ben Wright (the evil swine): All of them were basking in the
knowledge that I was to be forever lost in the coach section wedged between

two obese and slightly pungent salesmen who got their wardrobes from the
Salvation Army. They said I could come up and use their restroom if I could
peel myself from between the two guys. I hoped that the front of the airplane
would fall off.
We were all going to Jack Nicklaus’s golf tournament, the Memorial, in
Columbus. We had just left Fort Worth, Texas, where I had played and CBS
had televised the Colonial Invitational. I had just been elected to the policy
board of the PGA Tour — the players elect three members of the tour, and
along with three officers of the PGA of America and three independent busi-
ness leaders, we make up the tour policy board, which basically runs the PGA
Tour. It’s a very important job for an idiot like me to have, but the players
thought that my life wasn’t miserable enough, so they staked me to this tree.
I was going to Columbus not to play in Nicklaus’s tournament — it was an
invitational, and I wasn’t high enough on the money list to buy a Big Mac —
but to go to policy-board meetings for the first three days of the week. They
were closed-door meetings in which I could catch up on my sleep. The next
tournament, the Kemper, was in Washington, D.C., but I wouldn’t have to
leave until the end of the week.
I was fighting for position on the armrest of seat 28B when the flight atten-
dant came by and presented me with a bottle of champagne, compliments 
of the royal family in first class. These guys really know how to have a good
time when the bubbly is free.
I started hesitantly toward the front of the plane to thank my benefactors and
get away from the sumo-sized bookends I was seated between. As I scurried
to first class, I fell on an idea that could help solve my problem of having
nowhere to go after the policy-board meetings ended on Wednesday. I couldn’t
afford to go to Washington early, and I had no money to fly home for the four
days in between. I was a golfer caught in the headlights of bankruptcy.
After some quick banter, I told Frank that I had nothing to do from Thursday
to Sunday, and because I was on the policy board making decisions about 
TV contracts, I should watch how a televised event is produced. “Show up
Friday for rehearsal at 11 and check into the Stouffer’s on Thursday; we’ll
have a room for you,” Frank said. “Now get back to the screaming kids in
coach before I have you thrown off the plane for being up here.” He had the
bedside manner of Attila the Hun sporting a bad case of hemorrhoids, but 
at that moment I loved him.
I showed up promptly at 11, well fed from gorging on room service and
weary-eyed from the menu of movies that I signed to the room. I was a pig,
and I enjoyed the wallow.
270
Part V: Golf: It’s Electric! 

I opened the door to Frank’s office, and he bellowed from the confines of his
trailer for me to go out to the 16th hole. He didn’t sound like he wanted to
engage in light conversation, so I broke into a slight trot out toward the 16th.
I couldn’t help but wonder why I wasn’t going to sit in the trucks with Frank
while he did the telecast to gain some insight into how a telecast is produced,
every once in a while getting Frank some snacks or engaging him in casual
conversation. Why was I going to the 16th hole?
As I started to walk toward the tee, a voice came serenading down from high
atop the tower, beckoning me to come up. It was Verne Lundquist, the veteran
announcer. I managed to make my way up the tower and exchanged idle con-
versation with Verne’s spotter. Verne then handed me a headset and told me
to grab a chair. I asked what the headset was for, and he said, “Didn’t Frank tell
you that he wanted to try you as an announcer this week?” As I weighed the
decision between doing some spotting with caddies who missed the cut and
being on national television, the conversation with myself was, as usual, very
short.
“Where do I sit, Verne, and what do I do?” I said.
It looks like this in the tower: A little enclosure is surrounded with clear plastic,
much like the front seat of a car, with the windshield surrounding the front 
and you looking out at the green. Two monitors in front of the announcer show
the action taking place and a current leader board. The spotter is next to you,
giving you the scores and the clubs the players are hitting. In this case, spotter
Carl took up most of the room. Carl, who weighs 385 pounds, looks like he just
ate a sumo wrestler. There was not much room left in the front seat of this car.
My seat was outside this cubicle, next to the cameraman. Looking down at the
action for the first time was really interesting. Golf looks incredibly easy from
way up there. How can those guys screw up so many shots?!? I was above the
tension, up in the clouds. My, how this view changes your perspective on the
game.
But there were voices everywhere. The voice in my left ear was the director,
Frank, and the other voices were all the announcers from their towers.
Occasionally, I would hear a rogue voice, and I had no idea who it was. I
found out later that a guy operating a CB unit in the neighborhood had 
come through on our headsets. Welcome to network TV.
The rehearsal went pretty smoothly. I found out two things:
 Your conversation must be short. The action jumps all over the place,
and you can’t get stuck in the middle of a story.
 Never answer anything Frank says directly. The viewers can’t hear
Frank.
271
Chapter 16: Golf on TV

Those are the rules; obey at all costs.
The next day, my first on national television, was going smoothly. Verne 
and I were clicking like a car counter on a Los Angeles freeway. He would 
ask a question; I would answer. I never said, “What did you say, Frank?” I 
was rolling.
Due to a starter’s time that spreads the field, there was a large gap between
the group that had just walked off the 16th green and the next group that 
was approaching the 14th green. I had some free time, so I kicked back in the
chair and read some interesting tidbits on the personal lives of the golf pros.
I was awakened from my near-catatonic state by a combination of Frank throw-
ing the action to Verne and Verne asking me what this putt was going to do. I
looked down real fast and saw nobody on the 16th green. The next group walk-
ing up the 15th fairway. What was going on?
Verne had that Nordic look of desperation as he asked me again, and Frank
was starting to annoy me with, “Answer him, you culturally lost golf derelict.”
I looked down at the green again, and there still wasn’t anybody around. Were
they seeing ghosts, or was this just a ruse to excite the poor rookie caught
lost in thought? After several more verbal harassments from Frank and the
look of a desperate sheepdog on the face of Verne, I decided to play along
with their game. I said, “Verne, this putt should be fairly fast, because it’s
going down the hill toward the water.” Verne met my response by saying,
“Boy, you were right, Gary; that putt cruised by the hole and, if he’d hit it a
little harder, it would have gone down in the water.”
Wait a minute!
The 16th green at Muirfield Village golf course has no water anywhere near it,
except for the drinking fountain on the tee. I made the water stuff up because
the boys were trying to get the rookie and I was trying to throw them a curve.
It was a wild pitch.
I heard Frank say, “Throw it to 18, Verne.” Then Verne looked at me with
those screeching Scandinavian eyes and asked if I could respond a little
quicker next time. Frank hit his button and began to verbally blast me for my
“funereal response,” which I took as less than congratulatory.
At this point, I realized that they weren’t kidding, and we really were on the
air. Oh, no! “Verne,” I said, “Could you help me in my moment of conjecture
and look down on the 16th green and tell me if you see anybody, or do I have
to call a ghostbuster?
272
Part V: Golf: It’s Electric! 

“Of course there’s nobody there,” said Verne. Now I really was confused.
“Verne, if there’s nobody there, why did you say the ball rolled 7 feet by the
hole when I made up the thing about the water being there in the first place?”
I asked, dumbfounded.
“There is water there,” Verne said, with a stern look of what-in-the-heck-are-
you-talking-about? on his face.
“There’s no water on the 16th hole,” I said.
“I know that, you idiot, but we were doing the 12th hole!”
“Wait a minute, we’re doing the 12th hole also? I was told to go out to the
16th hole with you.”
What had happened was that, during rehearsal, we hadn’t used a camera 
for our other hole, the 12th, because the camera was broken. I had no way 
of knowing that I was supposed to be looking at the 12th hole as well as the
16th, unless I had called the Psychic Friends hotline. Confusing business,
huh?
As life weaves its reckless mysteries, the par-3 12th hole at Muirfield Village
has water surrounding the green. The putt had come from the top tier really
fast toward the water and had gone 7 feet past the hole. I totally made some-
thing up, and it just happened to be a perfect call in this less-than-perfect
business.
This is my legacy; I am bound by its structure. I cannot deny its existence. It
has made me rich. I hope that I can bring you insight on how this medium
works so that you can understand our chaos.
The growth in the popularity of golf over the last 40 years has been reflected
in the amount of coverage the game gets on television. Christmas week may
be the only time of year when you can’t watch the pros teeing it up in some
exotic locale. Television has embraced golf to the extent that the top players
today are as well known as their counterparts in baseball, basketball, and
football. In this chapter, I show you why.
Why Golf Is So Popular
Golf is a sport that’s played all year long, from the first week in January
through the second week in December. Golf on the tube has grown propor-
tionately, from a few shows in the 1950s to nonstop golf on TV today. We 
get that with the Golf Channel, which covers golf 24 hours a day.
273
Chapter 16: Golf on TV

The places that TV takes you during the golf year are a vacationer’s dream.
Every Saturday and Sunday, you can do the couch thing and watch the vari-
ous tours play from every corner of the globe. The golf is good, but the pic-
tures are stunning. The viewing audience and the PGA Tour start to prepare
themselves in the Florida swing for the first major tournament of the year in
early April, when Augusta and the Masters Tournament are in full bloom.
Then the PGA Tour settles into normalcy for a while, as players start to pre-
pare for the heat and the long rough of the U.S. Open in mid-June. The month
of July is for the British Open and its storied past; plenty of plaid and wind-
blown golf balls decorate the landscape. The last of the four majors, the PGA
Championship, is played in August. These are the tournaments that all pro-
fessional golfers gear up to play well in. They’re the measure of a player’s
worth and his quest — and they make for great viewing.
During the first part of the year, many celebrities play in the AT&T tourna-
ment at Pebble Beach and the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. If viewing the stars
is your thing, you can see these would-be golfers hacking away at all their
inhibitions during these pro-am tournaments.
If Hollywood stars are not your idea of role models, maybe professional
golfers can fill the void. You don’t see much trash talk or foul play on the golf
course. In fact, golf may be the only game in which the players police them-
selves. Almost weekly, there’s an example of a player on the PGA Tour penal-
izing himself for some inadvertent Rules transgression. Can you imagine a
basketball player turning down two points because he pushed someone out
of the way en route to the basket? Probably not!
Golf and Television
Sports and TV have become inextricably linked through the years. As
recently as 1946, fans were still providing their own images to the dramatic
radio broadcast of the 1946 World Series.
Baseball proved to be perfect for a new tube technology that beamed rays of
hypnotic light into everyone’s home. But golf presented many unique chal-
lenges to television coverage. Aside from playing on 150 acres as opposed to
being surrounded by fences at a distance of 400 feet from home plate, there
was constant, ongoing action with many athletes competing independently at
any given moment. What’s a broadcaster to do?
Keep it simple — and they did. The first broadcast of a golf event was the
renowned Tam O’Shanter Classic from Chicago on Sunday, August 22, 1953.
One camera fixed on the 18th hole. Perhaps as an indication of the excitement
that golf would eventually bring to the tube, the moment for this particular
274
Part V: Golf: It’s Electric! 

coverage was opportune. Lew Worsham, a modestly successful pro, approached
the 18th not unlike many finishing holes that year, but the difference this time
was that this shot would yield an often sought, but not often produced, result:
a hole-in-one. If you’re interested, the videotape of that monumental moment
is available in the game’s video archives.
It was the unbridled charisma of one man that turned the nation’s attention
to the sport of captains and kings. Arnold Palmer, of the hitch-and-smile, go-
for-broke style and unwavering charm, turned the viewing world on its ear
and kept viewers glued to their sets. In 1960, Palmer began carrying an indus-
try on his back as golf and television developed together to provide a founda-
tion for a sport that would ultimately reap immense rewards in the great
sports and television-rights derby.
Behind the scenes
Many people believe that golf is the most difficult sport to cover. Think about
it: The playing field is anything but standard. No precisely measured court 
or white lines of delineation. The playing field is a park, a wide-open expanse
covering acres of competitive challenges. There are no timeouts and no
clock. Play begins at ten-minute intervals, and players embark upon the play-
ing field for their bid at the color red. (For the uninitiated, scores below par
are noted on the scoreboard with red numbers.) At any one time, 100 or more
competitors may be playing on the same course, all on different holes. No
orchestrated playing time here. So how does it get covered?
First, golf courses have to be technically prepped. That’s just a fancy way of
saying that you must run cable, and lots of it, in order to broadcast signals
from the golf course to the television truck. A small army of engineers and
cable-pullers usually invades on the Sunday or Monday preceding broadcast
week. Tractor-trailers filled with several million dollars worth of cameras and
technical equipment are deployed. The average telecast requires miles of
cable, often two dozen or more cameras mobilized in a variety of ways, video-
tape machines, digital disc recorders, character generators, spotters, high-
tech graphics gizmos (for those great images of super-slo-mo swings and golf
balls squished against clubfaces at impact), and a control room staffed with
some of the best producers and directors in the industry.
The staff is divided into two groups, known as above the line and below the
line. Those with above-the-line duties are the folks who make the production
and story-line decisions. I’ll start at the top:
 Producer: The producer is responsible for creating the story line of the
event. Remember how different golf is from basketball, football, and
most other sports. It may be the only sport in which the participant hits
a stationary ball, but often at great distances. The better producers and
directors are able to provide a variety of replays and isolated coverage
275
Chapter 16: Golf on TV

of the action. It requires them to be intimately conversant with the game
itself and to know all the key players. Although the story line is dictated
by who is playing well, the viewer must be mindful that a dozen contes-
tants or more may be newsworthy. The producer’s task is to capture 
the players’ shot-making efforts and to make the drama coherent to the
viewer.
 Director: The director is responsible for placing cameras at strategic
spots around the course to capture the best possible angles of coverage.
The director communicates with the camera personnel, the audio crew,
and other technical people to provide insightful coverage of the action
on the course. While the producer may say, “Let’s go to Vijay Singh next
on the ninth green,” the director is responsible for readying those cam-
eras and operators and for framing the shots that will most dramatically
convey the action to viewers. The director also oversees the complex
array of audio tracks, graphics, and limitless special effects.
 Associate directors: One associate director supports the producer and
director. Although titles may change from network to network, standard
coverage usually involves an “iso” truck in which an associate director
records coverage of shots that are central to the story line but not
shown live. You might hear an announcer say, “Moments ago. . . .” Taped
coverage assures the viewer of seeing as many shots as possible in a
sensible sequence to show and tell the whole story. Some producers
favor using more taped shots than others.
A second associate director is known as the sundial, or timer. (Sundial is
an inside joke, a nickname for one A.D. whose countdowns in and out of
commercials were less than accurate.) Approximately 12 times in a tele-
cast, the network breaks for at least 2 minutes of commercials or promo-
tional announcements. Someone is responsible for giving a count out 
of the program action into the commercial time to make the transition
appear seamless to the viewer. The same is true coming out of a com-
mercial back to the center of activity, the remote truck.
 Talent: The remaining critical element of the above-the-line team is the
talent. That’s us, the talking heads you hear on the air. The producers
and directors provide the blueprint of the telecast, but the talent deliv-
ers it. We are the artisans who sell the vision. The National Football
League might employ as many as four announcers per broadcast, and
baseball maybe three, but the multiple broadcast booths in a golf tele-
cast necessitate a team of announcers in this decidedly individual sport.
Networks use up to eight on-air personalities to recite the golf action.
Chemistry is key. Do you love Johnny Miller and Roger Maltbie? Jim
Nantz? Mike Tirico? Lanny Wadkins? Paul Azinger? Maybe even me? Each
network’s team has a unique personality.
276
Part V: Golf: It’s Electric! 

The 18th tower is the focal point where the host and key analyst hold
forth. From there, networks differ. Some choose the analyst-per-green
format á la CBS, erecting towers adjacent to the final few greens on the
course. From these vantage points, the announcers have clear, above-
the-gallery views and can call the action of a particular hole or report 
on a neighboring hole within view of the tower. ABC uses a secondary
studio in which the talent view the monitor and report each shot played.
All networks employ on-course personnel who walk with designated
players and report on the action from the ground.
 Technical personnel: The below-the-line folks are the technical people —
camera and audio operators, engineers, and tech gurus. Of course, every-
one involved in this tightly knit, interlocking puzzle is important, but one
key individual brings it all together, being in charge of pressing the but-
tons that effectively determine which pictures and sounds go on the air.
That person is the technical director. The burden of the end product falls
to the technical director, who sits in the production truck next to the
director. If you ever notice a glitch in moving from one shot to another or
a graphic appearing and then disappearing hastily, chances are that the
technical director made a mistake or got some bad information from the
field.
All in all, when you add up all the above-the-line and below-the-line folks,
the spotters, the runners, and the craft-services personnel (which is a fancy,
entertainment-industry way of saying caterers), a network may roll into town
with a production crew of more than 100 people — not to mention the satel-
lite truck that beams signals from the remote broadcast site off a satellite, to
the studio, and eventually to your TV set.
Let’s make a deal
Of course, none of this would happen if there weren’t a demand for telecasts
of well over 1,000 hours of professional golf every year. Golf continues to
grow in popularity for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the sup-
port of corporate America. Why? Well, first by golf’s very position in the
world as a game played by the captains and kings of industry. It’s a game of
tradition, honor, and integrity. The image of the game presented by the play-
ers is essential to the sponsors and magnified in importance by what has
become an increasingly cluttered world of athletes whose mugs — and some-
times mug shots — are apt to be found on the front page of the newspaper
rather than in the back.
Golf forged its way to prominence as a major player in television sports in a
rather innovative fashion. It began meekly in an effort to gain exposure on TV.
Time buys, rights, and production deals are the principal forces that drive
network coverage.
277
Chapter 16: Golf on TV

Time buys
A network places an hourly value on its airtime — no different from a super-
market stocking shelves. Each hour of airtime represents a quantifiable asset
for the network. In this case, a program buyer negotiates a date and airtime
for a program. The program buyer purchases the time from the network,
arranges to sell the time to advertisers, and then receives all the revenue pro-
duced in the allotted airtime.
Here’s an example: The McCord Challenge buys two hours of time from GHI
Network. McCord pays the network, say around $1 million. Network rules
allow the producer to sell 18 commercial units within the hour. So, for its mil-
lion dollars, the McCord group receives 36 commercial units (18 × 2) to allo-
cate to its list of sponsors or to sell.
The formula is fairly basic, and not inexpensive because the packager bears
the production cost, and costs can easily top $500,000 for reasonable golf
coverage. With professional talent added, there’s well over a $1.5-million
investment from the outset. That’s before the cost of a tournament purse,
and on-site event amenities from range balls to security to cookies in the
players’ locker room.
Rights and production
Here’s where networks take a risk. The escalation in sports rights fees in
recent decades has resulted in billion-dollar TV contracts for the NFL, NBA,
Major League Baseball, and NASCAR as well as golf. Network executives
decide that they’re willing to pay an upfront fee to the rights holders and 
provide production in exchange for the opportunity to maximize their 
investment in the advertising marketplace.
278
Part V: Golf: It’s Electric! 
Ten things a golf announcer should never do
 Never talk to your director on the air. No
one else can hear the director, and people
will think you have an imaginary friend.
 Don’t get the sound guy mad at you. He’ll
cut you off when you’re making a witty com-
ment and keep you on the air while you’re
mumbling.
 Never tell the TV audience how good a
player you used to be.
 Never say that a shot is impossible. You’ll
quickly be proven wrong.
 Never talk down to the audience.
 Don’t get into long stories. You’ll be cut off
as the director switches to another hole.
 Never use clichés. It shows that you’re lazy.
 Never tell the audience what viewers can
clearly see on the TV screen.
 Never assume that the audience knows
anything about the game of golf.
 Never, ever assume that what you do for a
living has any role in the elevation of
humankind.

Golf, through its increasing popularity, its broadening appeal, and the valu-
able image it provides for sponsors — the quality and virtually unmatched
demographics delivered — has taken its place among the major TV sports.
The PGA Tour signed a contract worth nearly $1 billion with the three broad-
cast networks plus ESPN, USA, and the Golf Channel for 2003 to 2006, a pot of
gold that keeps on overflowing.
What to Watch for on TV
By all means, enjoy the physical beauty of golf on television. But pay attention
to the players, too. You can learn a lot from watching not only their swings but
also their whole demeanor on the course. Listen to the language, the jargon,
the parlance being used. If you read this book — or any golf book — I’m sure
that you’ll notice the complexity of the game’s terms. There’s a lot of room for
confusion. Watching the game on TV can help. This is especially true when a
commentator analyzes a player’s swing: He’ll use terminology that you need to
understand to become part of the golfing world. (See Appendix A for more
help with golf terminology.)
Watch the players carefully. Pay attention to the rhythm of their swings. Pay
attention to their mannerisms — the way they waggle the club, the triggers
that set their swings in motion, the way they putt, the way they set their feet
in the sand before they play from bunkers, the way they stand on uphill and
downhill lies. In other words, watch everything! Soak it all in. Immerse your-
self in the atmosphere and ambience of golf. You’ll soon be walking the walk
and talking the talk.
That’s the big picture. That’s what everyone should watch. But what about
you specifically?
Watching Ernie Els or Annika Sorenstam on television is a good idea for
everyone. But there’s a limit to what most people can learn from most play-
ers. Pay particular attention to someone like Ernie if you happen to be tall
and slim. But if you happen to be shorter and more heavyset, you need to
look elsewhere. Make Lee Trevino, Craig Stadler, or Karrie Webb your role
model. In other words, find someone whose body type approximates your
own.
Then watch how that person stands to the ball at address. See how his arms
hang. See how much she flexes her knees. Golfers who are taller have much
more flex in their knees than their shorter counterparts.
Watch how “your pro” swings the club. Do his arms move away from his body
as the club moves back? How much does she turn her shoulders? How good is
his balance? Does she have a lot of wrist action in her swing? Or does he use
his arms to create width? Watch the pros every chance you get. Emulating their
swings and the way they conduct themselves will help your game.
279
Chapter 16: Golf on TV

What to Look for in the Top Pros
The players who get the most airtime are, of course, the more successful
ones. No network is going to waste valuable minutes on someone who’s out
of contention. Viewers want to watch the tournament being won and lost, so
those players shooting the lowest scores are the ones you’ll see most on TV.
Here’s what to look for in some of the most prominent players.
 Tiger Woods: Look at his virtuosity in every aspect of the game. He has
left no stone unturned in his pursuit of perfection. His stalking of Jack
Nicklaus’s record of 18 major wins is his driving force, providing his will
to succeed.
 Phil Mickelson: With two major victories under his belt (as of this writ-
ing), look for Phil to take advantage of his precise short game and really
focus on the majors for the rest of his career. He gives golf fans all over
the country a role model they love to root for.
 Vijay Singh: The golf motor that never stops, his aggressive, tireless pur-
suit of a repeatable golf swing is legendary on the practice tee, and has
him playing better than ever in his 40s.
 Ernie Els: The Big Easy has a golf swing that brings glimpses of the leg-
endary Sam Snead, with a demeanor that is made for greatness in major
championships. He’ll be a great player for a long time.
 Annika Sorenstam: The lady supreme of the LPGA Tour, her record in
terms of victories and winning percentage is better than anyone else’s
on any tour, man or woman. She has set the standard that the new blood
of the next generation will aspire to.
 John Daly: The PGA Tour’s science project — always evolving. Sometimes
imagining what John is thinking on the golf course is hard. But John is still
one of the biggest draws in the game. Why? Because he hits the ball the
farthest. Deep down inside, that’s what everyone wants to do.
 Sergio Garcia: He has an electric golf game that should produce a step
up to the next level — victories in major championships. He drives the
ball long and straight and has a wonderful short game. If he putts better
when it counts, he’ll move up in class.
 Michelle Wie: This young lady has the potential to do what Tiger Woods
did on the PGA Tour. Michelle turned pro late in 2005. When her time
comes — as I think it will, sooner or later — she could dominate on the
LPGA Tour. She has more talent than anyone I’ve seen come up in a long
time. It should be fun to watch her find her way to the top.

Take Your Punishment
You can learn the most from the players on TV by watching how they handle
problems. Professional players make most of their decisions with their heads,
not their hearts. So pay close attention to rules, situations, and the times
when a player has to manufacture a weird and wonderful shot to extricate 
the ball from trouble. And don’t forget to watch the more-frequent occasions
when a player accepts that a mistake has been made, takes the punishment,
and moves on. That’s when you know you’ve been watching a real golfer, one
who understands that everyone makes mistakes, and that he or she just
made one.
281
Chapter 16: Golf on TV
Tigermania!
Millions of golfers and golf fans owe their alle-
giance to one player. Thanks in large part to Tiger
Woods, the game is now in its latest golden age.
A new phenomenon was born when Woods
arrived. In the 1990s, he slew courses with his
length, made every putt he needed to make,
trademarked a fist pump, and for several years
could do no wrong. His first three wins came
against Davis Love III, Payne Stewart, and Tom
Lehman — and he ran through those men as if
they were players in the U.S. Amateur. He turned
Augusta National into the proverbial pitch-and-
putt course, reaching the par-5s with wedges. He
was golf’s highlight tape. Newsweek put him on
the cover. Sports Illustrated made him its
Sportsman of the Year. Jack Nicklaus predicted
that Tiger would win as many Masters titles as
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer — combined.
Because he is of mixed heritage — his father is
black and his mother is Thai — Tiger was more
than just a golfer with the skills to excel. He was
also a golfer of the people, a young man who rep-
resented the breaking down of ethnic barriers.
People said that he transcended the game, that
he was a crossover star who brought people to
golf who had never considered golf a sport. Kids
began turning up at golf tournaments — in
droves. They were white and black, Asian and
Hispanic, boys and girls. Golf had a new crowd,
and it was hungry for this kid from Cypress,
California, who turned golf into a video game.
When Tiger smiles, it seems that the whole golf
world smiles with him. It is a powerful thing.
What we relearned as Tiger Woods “slumped”
in 2003 and 2004 is that golf is not like basket-
ball. One player cannot dominate it the way
Michael Jordan did in the NBA. Golf is a game
of cycles, and not even Tiger can dominate all
the time. For one thing, he has more great play-
ers to beat than Arnold Palmer did. He also has
to deal with more than Palmer did — pressures
that can turn a young man old in a hurry. Tiger
plays almost every tournament under a death
threat, surrounded by a phalanx of security per-
sonnel. He cannot go to dinner or a movie with-
out being mobbed.
Potentially, he still could be the greatest golfer
who ever lived. He has the talent and the will, as
he proved by retooling his swing and roaring
again in 2005, when he won his ninth and tenth
majors. Time is on his side, and he certainly has
all the tools. But there’s more to golf than warp
clubhead speed and a burning competitive
edge. Tiger must keep refining those tools as he
continues to live with the highest set of expec-
tations placed on any golfer who has put a peg
in the ground.

That last point reminds me of a time when I let my heart — or my ego — rule
my decision-making process. I was playing in Memphis, I think. Anyway, I had
to birdie the last three holes during my second round in order to make the cut.
After my drive at the 16th, I had 223 yards to the hole, which was cut danger-
ously close to a large lake. I chose a 4-iron, convinced that I had enough club. I
didn’t. Splash!
I turned to my caddie and told him to give me another ball. He did. I hit the
next shot perfectly. Splash!
“Give me another ball.” Splash!
“Give me another ball.” Splash!
“Give me another ball.” Splash!
By this time, I knew that I clearly was using the wrong club. I knew it. My
caddie knew it. The local police knew it. But I wasn’t going to give up. This
was my manhood we were testing here.
Eventually, my caddie handed me another ball with a 3-iron, one more club. I
said, “What’s this?” He told me that I had only one ball left. So I took the 3-
iron and hit my last ball onto the green. I holed the putt for, I think, a 15.
The moral of the story? If you do stuff this stupid, they might make a movie
of it. In this case they did — the movie was Tin Cup, and Kevin Costner was
my alter ego in my pursuit of disaster.
282
Part V: Golf: It’s Electric! 
The Masters and me
The entire CBS production crew, including Frank
Chirkinian (my producer at the time) and I, were
dining at the Tournament Players Championship
two weeks before the 1987 Masters. The con-
versation turned quickly to who would be
assigned to which holes during the telecast in
Augusta. Everyone had his assignments except
for me. I was left holding air.
I had been working with CBS on a part-time
basis for only a few months, but the announcing
crew was excited that I would be going to
Augusta. When Frank excluded me from the
fracas, anarchy prevailed. Pat Summerall led
the charge for my inclusion, and the others fol-
lowed, but to no avail. It was late in the day on
the Saturday telecast when Frank, between
commercial breaks, announced to everyone
that I was going to the hallowed grounds of
Augusta National after all.
I was told to be at Augusta by Tuesday for a
meeting with Hord Hardin, the tournament direc-
tor. Frank was waiting for me when I arrived. We
proceeded to Hardin’s office; I felt like I was
going to the principal’s office. There was a look of
concern on Frank’s face as we went into the cat-
acombs of the clubhouse at Augusta.

283
Chapter 16: Golf on TV
Jim Nantz joined us as we walked down the
narrow corridor toward the door at the end of
the hall. I was dressed rather spectacularly in
white Calvin Klein jeans and a bulky DKNY
sweater ablaze in yellow, the whole outfit
topped with a Panama straw hat. I was a walk-
ing rebuke to tradition.
As we approached the darkened door at the end
of the hall, it creaked open as if willed by a higher
power. A shadowy figure appeared backlit
against a ray of sun filtered through the lone
window. Hord Hardin greeted us like Lurch of
The Addams Family. Frank and Jim sat in the
corner, and I proceeded to take residence on the
big couch in front of Hardin’s desk. I was the plot.
After introductions and small talk about my work
on television, Hardin proceeded to make a pas-
sionate speech about the flavor of this tourna-
ment. “We must maintain tradition; it is the
cornerstone of the tournament,” he said with
conviction. The speech was beautiful and actu-
ally kept my attention, which is hard to do. But I
couldn’t help looking around and seeing the dimly
lit pictures of Bobby Jones and the 13th hole that
filled the room. It dawned on me that this was
Augusta National, home of the Masters, and that
this was a big deal. At moments like these, when
I’m truly moved, I do stupid things. I think I do
them because it relieves tension. I waited until
Hardin had made his closing remarks, and then
abruptly stood up and asked him if he thought the
clown outfit I had planned to wear on Saturday
was out of the question. Frank immediately put his
head in his hands, and Jim started to whistle.
Hardin looked at Frank, who was not about to
look up, and then addressed me. “Probably a
good idea,” he said.
“Darn, I’m gonna lose the deposit,” I said with
my Panama hat pulled down over my eyes. It
was a retort that would have made Bill Murray
proud.
As Hardin closed the aging oak door of his
office behind us, Frank reached up, grabbed the
back of my neck, and applied a pressure hold
that would have choked a Burmese python.
“Don’t you ever just shut up and listen, you
moron?” he asked. I couldn’t respond because
of the restriction of air in my esophagus, but Jim
was faintly heard to say, “Maybe this is a bad
idea bringing him here.” Frank affirmed the
notion with more pressure on my neck. But I
was on the broadcast.
The honeymoon didn’t last long. In 1994, while
trying to be articulate about a shot to the 17th
green, I explained that Jose Maria Olazabal had
better not hit it over the green because there
were “body bags” down there, and no one ever
recovers. That was the first strike. I paddled on
down this river of no return and decided to
describe the next putt by Tom Lehman, also on
the 17th green, as being so fast that I didn’t think
they mowed those greens, “I think they bikini
wax ’em.” Strike two, three, four — and don’t
come back again.
The rest is history, which is what my colorful
Masters commentary became: history!

In This Chapter
 Where to find the coolest golf Web sites
 How to “tour” great courses from your home or office
 How to buy golf gear online
You’ll be amazed at the world of golf you can explore without leaving your
desk. You can travel to exotic locales, visit great courses, and buy golf
clubs, golf balls, golf clothes, and golf books (including For Dummies books!).
These days, it’s all on the Internet.
Cool Cyber-Golf Sites
The Internet offers a nearly infinite array of golf stuff. Google the word golf and
you get 91,500,000 sites. But if you surf the Net aimlessly, you’ll only drown in a
digital deluge. So here’s a quick look at some of my favorite cyber-golf hangouts.
Together, these sites offer 99 percent of what you need on the information
superhighway. You can thank me later.
The PGA Tour
Millions of golf fans turn to the PGA Tour’s site for news, statistics, player
profiles, and, perhaps most important of all, up-to-the-minute tournament
coverage (see Figure 17-1). At www.pgatour.com, you can follow your favorite
players as they compete, drill down into their stats, and even look at their
score cards. You can check out audio and video clips, too. And to the delight
of hardcore fans, there’s now ShotLink, an interactive feature that allows users
to get an inside look at every shot by every player only nanoseconds after it
happens.

You can follow more than Tiger, Phil, and friends at this site. This is also
the home site of the Champions Tour — the one I play on — and the
Nationwide Tour, golf’s highest “minor league,” where you’ll find the stars
of tomorrow.
There’s fantasy here, too. PGATour.com is home to the Tour’s official fantasy
golf game, in which you get to spend a million virtual dollars to assemble a
dream team of five PGA Tour stars who’ll play for you every week. TOUR
Fantasy is free to play, and you can win golf goodies.
The LPGA
This site is similar to www.pgatour.com (see the preceding section), if
not nearly as lavish. Here’s where you’ll find stats, profiles, and live tourna-
ment updates from the Ladies Professional Golf Association (see Figure 17-2).
Want to follow Annika Sorenstam’s latest quest to make LPGA history?
Want to read a blog by one of the young stars who are making women’s golf
one of the fastest-growing attractions of all? Here’s your chance — just go to

GOLFonline
GOLFonline (www.golfonline.com) is an interactive magazine. This 
cyber-phenomenon combines the interactive nature of networking with
the informational content of a golf magazine (see Figure 17-3). GOLFonline
includes original, up-to-date contributions from well-known golf writers
and personalities, including columnist David Feherty, my fellow CBS golf 
commentator and one of the funniest writers around. It also offers plenty of
instruction. GOLFonline is all about insight and interactivity on subjects rang-
ing from tournaments and travel to equipment and swing tips, all presented
using some of the best text and multimedia capabilities available. It’s one of
the best resources I’ve seen at the intersection of two of society’s most popu-
lar bodies: golfers and online users.
GolfObserver.com
One of the sport’s best sites features an amazing amount of information every
day, updated faster than you can say “Fore!” (See Figure 17-4.) At GolfObserver.
com you’ll find headlines, stats, smart columnists, tournament previews and
reviews, and the invaluable Golf Notebook. I check this site all the time to
make sure I haven’t missed anything.

visit during the majors. There’s great coverage of the Masters every spring
at www.masters.org (see Figure 17-9), and wall-to-wall U.S. Open stuff at
the United States Golf Association’s Web site, www.usga.org. And you can
follow each year’s British Open at two related sites, www.opengolf.com and
www.randa.org. The latter is worth a visit any time of year — it’s the home
cyber-turf of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews (the mecca of

In collaboration with ESPN, America’s premier golf magazine has created
one of the best sites on the Web (www.golfdigest.com). GolfDigest.com
is chock-full of insightful commentary, interesting stories, and professional
instruction (see Figure 17-11). You’ll find inside stuff from the magazine, 
opinions from notable writers, and reports from the tours. You can also find
an equipment hotline, get info about Golf Digest golf schools, view swing
sequences of great players, search for specific tips, and browse through
back issues of the magazine.
World Golf
Whenever I feel like exploring the wide world of golf, I tootle on over to World
Golf (www.worldgolf.com). This site is an online international golf and travel
guide. It features numerous links that let you bounce easily from one area of
the golfing world to another. You can make reservations at St. Andrews in
Scotland and then view pictures of desert courses in Palm Springs. World
Golf is easy to navigate and offers dozens of departments (see Figure 17-12).

Online Course Guides
Are you having fun yet? Sure you are. As you can see, there’s a whole virtual
world out there, just waiting to be discovered. Don’t be shy. Now it’s time for
a virtual tour of about a zillion golf courses.
If you don’t have enough time or money to play all the world’s great courses,
don’t fret. The Net can take you to them for free. Web sites carry descriptions,
layouts, and score cards for countless golf courses around the world. From
the comfort of your own desk chair, you can explore championship layouts
from Alabama to Zimbabwe.
For example, Figure 17-13 shows the home page for golf’s oldest and greatest
course: the Old Course at St Andrews, Scotland (www.standrews.org.uk).
From this site, you can view historical information about the course, make hotel
and tee-time reservations, and even play a virtual round. Similar pages cover
other famous golf courses and resorts — often with gorgeous photos — from
Pebble Beach (www.pebble-beach.com) to PGA West (www.pgawest.com)
to Shadow Creek (www.shadowcreek.com).
Many of the sites I discuss earlier, in the “Cool Cyber-Golf Sites” section, feature

Virtual Pro Shops: Buying Golf Gear Online
I can’t let you get away from my tour of the Net without trying to sell you

ufacturer (and even some unusual minor ones) has a presence on the Web,
so don’t hesitate to check out such sites as CallawayGolf.com, NikeGolf.com,
Ping.com, TaylorMadeGolf.com, and Titleist.com. Many of the cyber hangouts
listed earlier in this chapter offer links to their own pro shops as well. The
sites mentioned in this section specialize in bringing you good prices on
brand-name new and used products.
eBay
The 500-pound gorilla of Web sales has become one of the hubs of the golf

not only tons of golf equipment but clothing, carts, games, and memorabilia,
not to mention golf-themed humidors, candles, hip flasks, and plenty of other

Tiger versus Golden Tee: 
The Best of Virtual Golf
In This Chapter
 Finding out why Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the top video game
 Looking at golf simulators: Almost the real thing?
 Understanding the Golden Tee phenomenon
I
t’s amazing but true: Video games are a bigger business than Hollywood.
All those beeps and boings coming out of arcades, PCs, and consoles like
PlayStation, Xbox, and GameCube rake in more money than all the movies
made in any given year. Millions of consumers are introduced to golf through
virtual versions of the game. That must be why so many teenagers think of
me as the guy from Tiger’s video game, not the guy on TV.
There’s one possible downside to all this: Electronic golf games tend to make
the game seem pretty easy. You press a button or roll a trackball and —
boom! — the ball flies 300 yards. As you probably know by now, real golf is
much harder. In real life, the ball has an annoying tendency to dribble side-
ways and stop.
But there’s an upside, too: Video golf is fun! And the competition can be fierce.
The Leader: Tiger Woods PGA Tour
Tiger Woods PGA Tour is the dominant game, an ever-evolving cornucopia of
wizardry from the folks at EA Sports. Since its debut almost ten years ago,
Tiger’s product has led the field, thanks to realistic action and more features
than you can shake a driver at.

Through the magic of mo-cappin’ (cybertalk for a process called motion cap-
ture), Woods’s real swing is replicated muscle-by-muscle in the video version,
which is played on countless Sony PlayStations, Microsoft Xboxes, and
Nintendo GameCubes worldwide.
In the newest edition, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006, tour pros Chris DiMarco,
Mike Weir, Luke Donald, and wacky dresser Ian Poulter join 17 other pros and
27 fictional players to challenge Tiger. You can use one of them or build your
own golfer, Frankenstein-style, by mixing and matching with EA Sports’s
Game Face technology. The action unfolds on dazzling digitized versions of
more than a dozen famous courses.
In the game’s Rivals Mode, you must beat great golfers of the past — using
old equipment and wearing vintage clothes — from Ben Hogan to Arnold
Palmer to Jack Nicklaus. Conquer them all and you go head-to-head against
Tiger for the all-time title.
I’m in there, too — not as a player, but as one of the announcers you hear
during play. My specialty is taunting players who hit bad shots. My announc-
ing partner is David Feherty, my CBS colleague. To record our commentary,
we had to hole up in a sound booth for three days, eight hours a day. Now,
being stuck in a room with Feherty all day is not unlike spending eight hours
in a phone booth with 30 adolescent baboons. But it was worth the ordeal —
I did the game to reach more young people, and it sure has worked. Now kids
come up to me and say, “Hey, you’re the dude who taunts me in the game!”
But the young get the last laugh. When the grandkids come over to my house,
my granddaughter Terra, who’s 10, beats the tar out of me and then she
taunts me.

Other golf video games
Although the Tiger Woods game has lapped
most of the field, there’s no shortage of video
diversions for you to try. Most of the others tend
to be more cartoonish than the EA Sports prod-
uct, but that can be a plus — particularly for
younger gamers.
Here’s a list of games you may want to have a
look at:
 Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour from Nintendo
stars the mustachioed character from
Donkey Kong and his friends. There are 
several courses, from an easy par-3 circuit to
some holes that could challenge any tour pro.
 Disney Golf brings Mickey Mouse, Goofy,
and other favorites from the Magic Kingdom
onto the links in various settings and formats.
Kids under 10 might like this one most of all.
 Hot Shots Golf FORE! from Sony can get too
off-the-wall for some folks, but others find
its irreverence refreshing. There’s minigolf
here, too.

Golf Simulators: Almost Reality?
Electronic golf simulators have gotten so good that they’re almost as much
fun as the real thing — and you can play Pebble Beach all by yourself in 45
minutes. The one thing that sets them apart from all other virtual versions of
the game is that you really get to swing a club. The graphics in such games
may not quite match those of PC and console entertainments, but it’s nice to
use more muscles than just the ones in your thumbs.
Many great golf simulators are available, from the huge (and hugely expensive)
to new, inexpensive models that would fit in a briefcase. Here’s a sampling:
 AboutGolf simulators (www.aboutgolf.com) feature excellent graph-
ics, great courses, and heavy-duty science to produce the next genera-
tion of indoor golf. Introduced in 2003, these machines are too expensive
for home use (unless you’re Bill Gates); you’ll find them in the growing
chain of PGA Tour Superstores.
 DeadSolid simulators (www.deadsolidgolf.com) let you swing full-
out at a screen. The company’s Ballflight Trajectory Sensor projects
where your shot will go, and you putt right into the screen. The
machines rent for $2,000 to $2,500 a day; you’ll see them at conventions
as well as at a few golf shops and sports bars. There are home models
available, too, though they can cost as much as a small car.
 High Definition Golf from Interactive Sports Technologies (www.
istgolf.com), another full-swing simulator, boasts photo-realistic
courses and optional swing analysis. Like the AboutGolf and DeadSolid
simulators, this one may be too expensive for most golfers to own, but
it’s great fun to play if you find one in your town.
 Launchpad from Electric~Spin Coporation (www.electricspin.com)
is a different story — a compact device that sells for a reasonable $249.
This is a cut-down version of the much larger full-swing simulators.
Using a short club and a ball on a tether, you can “play” Pebble Beach,
St. Andrews, Bethpage Black, and other courses. Launchpad can also
work in conjunction with Tiger Woods PGA Tour.
 PC Tour Personal Golf Simulator from Club Champ (www.thepctour.
com) is another small device that works with a laptop and sells for less
than $300. Hitting a ball on a stand over a strip of artificial turf, you can
play alone or in a foursome and use every club in your bag.
Some of these golf simulators are so good that you’ll never get any work
done. But that’s okay — after all, that’s what golf is for!

Chapter 18: Tiger versus Golden Tee: The Best of Virtual Golf

The Golden Tee Phenomenon
If you’ve been in a sports bar in the last few years, you’ve surely seen the
arcade-style game called Golden Tee Golf. Back in 1989, the game was devel-
oped by a couple of tech whizzes at Incredible Technologies, a small firm in
Arlington Heights, Illinois. They packed almost as much info into the pro-
gramming as NASA used to put a man on the moon, and paired it with a track-
ball that let players wham the pixilated ball vast distances, with hooks, slices,
and backspin. Veteran tour star Peter Jacobsen provided the voiceover —
“He’s on the dance floor!” — which soon sounded as familiar as “What’ll it
be?” in taverns everywhere.
Golden Tee was no overnight sensation, but over the next decade it surprised
everyone by becoming what the company calls “the most popular coin-op
video game in history.” Most of today’s play, however, is with five- and ten-
dollar bills, as well as with credit cards. There are more than 100,000 Golden
Tee machines in use around the world. Most may still be in bars and pool
halls, but some players put them in their homes. The last time I checked on
eBay, you could buy a full-size arcade-style console for anywhere from $700
up to $2,995, with a brand-new Home Edition selling for $3,975. You can buy
Golden Tee visors, shirts, and even golden golf tees — all for a game that
requires no tees!
Golden Tee is fun, addictive, and fairly realistic when you get used to the
trackball. My caddie, Matt Sanders, is terrific at it. To score well, you need to
play like Matt — hurl yourself at that trackball for 400-yard drives, and figure
out the shortcuts that are programmed into the game. Sometimes, for
instance, you can drive the green on a par-4 hole by slicing the ball around a
mountain. Get to where you can average 10 or more under par for an 18-hole
round and you might be ready for tournament play.
But beware: There are players out there who routinely break 50 for a par-72
round. Many have more than 1,000 virtual holes in one, and some earn more
than $75,000 a year playing Golden Tee tournaments. No matter how many
beers you’ve had, do not bet with one of those guys.

T
his is my favorite section of the book. I give you ten
timeless tips so that you can avoid the common faults
I see repeated on golf courses all over the world. I tell you
about some of my favorite golf courses, some of my favorite
public golf courses, and who I think are the best players of
all time. I even give you my top golf disaster stories.
This Part of Tens was my therapy. I needed to write this
stuff to keep my sanity. I hope you enjoy this section and
remember: In golf, we all speak the same language —
utterances of the insane!

Chapter 19
Golf’s Ten Commandments
In This Chapter
 Using the right club for the right shot
 Moving your head just a little
 Keeping your sense of humor
 Betting sensibly
 Adjusting your shot to deal with the wind
 Taking golf lessons
 Teeing the ball up
 Giving yourself a break when you mess up
H
aving been around golf for a while, I’ve noticed certain bad habits that
my friends constantly repeat on the course. Just knowing not to make
these mistakes will help you live a long and peaceful life on the links.
I’ve racked my feeble brain and jotted down ten tips so that you won’t suffer
the same cataclysms that I see on golf courses all over the world.
Take Enough Club to Get to Your Target
I’m constantly playing with amateurs who consistently come up short with
their approach shots to the green. For whatever reason, they always choose a
club that would get their shot only to the front of the green — even if they
were to hit the most solid shot of their lives. Instead, take a club that you can
swing at 80 percent and still get to the hole. Conserve your energy; you have
a long life ahead of you!

If You Can Putt the Ball, Do It
Don’t always use a lofted club around the greens. I have a friend at home
called “Flop-Shot Fred” who is always playing high sand-wedge shots around
the green, regardless of what the shot calls for. I think his idol is Phil
Mickelson, who can hit these shots straight up in the air. Leave this kind of
shot to guys like Phil, who can handle them. My best advice is to use a club
that can hit this shot with the lowest trajectory possible. If you can putt the
ball, do it.
Keep Your Head Fairly Steady
You’re going to move your head a little during the swing, especially with the
longer clubs. But try not to move it too much. Moving your head too much
leads to all sorts of serious swing flaws that make this game very difficult.
Have someone watch you to see whether you move your head, or watch
yourself in the mirror while you take practice swings.
Keep Your Sense of Humor
If everything else fails, you can keep your sense of humor and still survive, or
at least die laughing.
Bet Only What You Can Afford to Lose
You can cause some serious problems among friends by betting for more
money than you have. Never bet what you can’t afford to lose. My theory was
to bet everything in my pocket except for $10, and that was to pay for the gas
home.
Keep the Ball Low in the Wind
When the wind starts to kick up, I see golfers play their normal shots and fail
to hit the ball lower to allow for the conditions. Play the ball back in your
stance, put your hands ahead of the ball, and keep them ahead of the ball at
impact. Keep the ball as low as you can, and you can manage your game
much more efficiently. You probably won’t lose as many golf balls, either.
308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Take Some Golf Lessons
If you really want to have fun playing this game, start off with a few lessons to
get you on the right track. And, of course, read this book in its entirety. It’s
amazing what you can do with a clear concept in your mind of how to make a
golf swing.
Do Not Give Lessons to Your Spouse
Giving golf lessons to your spouse should be a federal offense. Don’t do it!
Doing so can only lead to disaster. Invest some money in lessons instead. 
Get good instruction and reap the benefit: peace of mind.
Always Tee It Up at the Tee Boxes
Whenever it’s legal (in the teeing area), tee the ball up. This game is more fun
when the ball’s in the air. As Jack Nicklaus once said, “Through years of expe-
rience I have learned that air offers less resistance than dirt.”
Never Blame Yourself for a Bad Shot
Give yourself a break. This game is hard enough without blaming everything
on yourself. Find creative ways to blame something else. I like to blame my
bad shots on magnetic force fields from alien spacecraft. Let your mind go,
and see how crazy your excuses can be. Save your sanity!

Chapter 20
Gary’s Ten Favorite Courses
In This Chapter
 Getting a feel for some of the best courses in the world
 Looking at the courses your favorite golfers play
T
he longer you play golf, the more courses you visit. Some courses are
along the ocean, and others are in the desert. Many have trees that frame
your every shot. Others are devoid of trees, with a horizon that seems to
stretch on forever.
Some golf courses are fastened onto flat land, and others are borne by the
hills and valleys of rural America. Limitless features attach themselves to
each golf course — that’s what makes each course a separate journey. One 
of the reasons this game is so much fun is that the playing field is always
changing.
Many golf architects have put their fingerprints on the map of American golf.
These architects employ different design philosophies, which keeps the look
of every golf course different. Robert Trent Jones incorporates large, undulat-
ing greens with enormous bunkers guarding the landing areas. Pete Dye uses
railroad ties to reinforce the greens, giving his courses the “Dye” look. Jack
Nicklaus uses wildly undulating greens and expansive fairways as his trade-
mark. Tom Fazio works wonders with all sorts of land — he’s a guy who could
build you a terrific course on the moon. And Tom Doak is a minimalist, using
natural terrain as much as he can. You’ll see a wide variety of golf courses in
your golfing life.
I based my choices for the all-time great courses on their challenge and
beauty. Royal Melbourne is one that I haven’t even played. Greg Norman 
told me that Royal Melbourne is in his top three, so who am I to argue?
These ten courses are my favorites. Half of them are private, and an act of
Congress would not get you through the gates. (I list my favorite public
courses in Chapter 21.) But half the courses on my list offer public access:
Pebble Beach, Pinehurst No. 2, Harbour Town, the Straits course at Whistling
Straits, and Bandon Dunes. They’re not cheap, but you don’t have to know
the right people to play there.

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Pebble Beach (Monterey, California)
Pebble Beach is an extraordinary place to do anything. Golf has made it pop-
ular, and the land has made it legendary. Robert Louis Stevenson called this
stretch of land “the greatest meeting of land and sea in the world.” Pebble
Beach is truly one of the most beautiful spots on earth, and it’s blessed with
two of my favorite courses in the world: Pebble Beach and Cypress Point.
I’ve been playing Pebble Beach Golf Links since I was 15 years old. We used 
to play the California state amateur on these storied links. We would round
up ten guys and rent a motel room together. We based the sleeping arrange-
ments on how well we’d played that day: Low round would get his pick of the
two beds. High round would get the other bed — we figured he needed some
sleep with all the swinging he did that day. Everybody else grabbed some
floor. Those were the fun days, when golf was a twinkle in your eye, and 
innocence made the game appear easy.
Pine Valley (Clementon, New Jersey)
Pine Valley is the greatest course without an ocean view. If you have a week
to hang with your friends and play golf, Pine Valley is the place. The grounds
are spectacular. Cottages house the overnight guests, and a great dining
room is full of golf memorabilia. The walls are saturated with tall tales of 
Pine Valley’s golf history. Best of all, most of the tall tales are true.
The course is one of the great designs in the world. Builder George Crump
bought this stretch of New Jersey land in 1912, and got input on the course
design from great architects including C. B. Macdonald, Harry Colt, Alister
Mackenzie, Donald Ross and A. W. Tillinghast. You measure a golf course by
how many holes you can remember after playing one round on it, and this
course is instantly etched in your mind — every hole, every tree, and every
bunker. I’m in total fascination when I walk through Pine Valley’s corridor 
of perfectly maintained grass. This course is a place that breathes with 
exuberance.
Cypress Point (Monterey, California)
Cypress Point is a golf course of such beauty and solitude you’d think that it
has holy qualities. From the quaint pro shop to the confining locker room and
dusty rooms that perch atop the clubhouse, Cypress Point is the place for
your final round.

The course winds from the pines into the sand dunes. Deer are everywhere,
often dodging your errant tee shots. You can see the turbulent Pacific on a
few holes going out and then again on most of the back nine, including the
famous 16th — a gorgeous and scary par-3 that must be seen to be believed.
I’ll never forget Cypress Point, which was the site of my first tour event in
1974. I birdied seven holes in a row (holes 7 through 13) and posted an 
opening round of 65. My career tapered off after that initial explosion.
Shinnecock Hills (Southampton, 
New York)
America’s premier Scottish-style links course, Shinnecock Hills is a treasure.
At this course, you play the game as it was designed to be played — along the
ground when the wind blows. The world’s best players saw how tough that
could be during the 2004 U.S. Open at Shinnecock.
From the porch of the nation’s oldest clubhouse all the way out to the Atlantic
Ocean, Shinnecock Hills is an American-bred beauty. Wind and golf course are
meshed into your being as you stroll through this artwork.
Pinehurst No. 2 (Pinehurst, 
North Carolina)
Pinehurst No. 2 is a masterpiece of design. Perhaps the most famous course
designed by the great Donald Ross, it hosted the U.S. Open in 1999 and 2005.
Hidden in the pines of Pinehurst, the course combines every facet of the
game and boasts some of the best-designed greens in the world.
This entire complex at Pinehurst takes you back half a century with its rustic,
Southern motif. Golf courses are everywhere — there are eight at the
Pinehurst Resort and many others nearby — and golf is the central theme of
the town.
We used to play a tour event at Pinehurst No. 2 every year, and we would get
into a golf frenzy weeks before our arrival. Pinehurst No. 2 is second to none
in the Southeast, a challenge to be revered and enjoyed.
313
Chapter 20: Gary’s Ten Favorite Courses

Whistling Straits — Straits Course
(Kohler, Wisconsin)
Whistling Straits opened in 1998 but really grabbed everyone’s attention
when it hosted the 2004 PGA Championship. Pete Dye took a flat wasteland
on Wisconsin’s lakefront and turned it into a rugged roller coaster of a course
that evoked Scotland at every turn. You’ll find grassy dunes and deep pot
bunkers on the Straits Course, as well as stone bridges and even Scottish
sheep standing almost sideways on hillsides.
When the wind whistles off Lake Michigan, this can be a terror track. But the
greens are large enough that if you play from the set of tees that matches
your skill level, you’ll have a chance to score. We’ll be playing the 2007 U.S.
Senior Open here, and in 2010 the PGA Championship returns to Whistling
Straits.
Bandon Dunes (Bandon, Oregon)
In 1999, an exciting new golf course opened on a remote stretch of Oregon
coastline. The architect was David McLay Kidd, a Scotsman who put a remark-
able, seemingly all-natural layout on a bluff above the Pacific. Kidd’s large
greens help give amateurs a chance, but the wind can play havoc with all kinds
of shots. Bandon Dunes is a purist’s delight — golf carts aren’t allowed, and
Kidd let this gorgeous stretch of land help dictate the routing of the course.
Bandon Dunes quickly became one of America’s premier golf resorts. In 2001, 
a new course designed by Tom Doak, Pacific Dunes, earned rave reviews, 
and 2005 brought a third natural beauty, Bandon Trails, designed by Ben
Crenshaw and Bill Coore. Mentioning them here is my way of applauding all
three courses. Still, it was Kidd’s creation that got the ball rolling. Bandon
Dunes is one of the best and most important new golf courses we’ve seen in 
a long time.
Royal Melbourne (Melbourne, Australia)
My information about Royal Melbourne comes from the Aussies I know on
tour. Greg Norman and Steve Elkington rave about the greens, which are said
to be some of the fastest in the world. The tournament course dates back to
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

1891, when the club hired Alister Mackenzie to sail down from Scotland to
oversee the design. The modern course is made up of 18 holes out of the 36
they have on site. I walked Royal Melbourne during the 2002 Presidents Cup
and found that the Aussies were right: The course is beautiful, with large
eucalyptus trees standing sentinel over the scene.
Harbour Town Links (Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina)
An intensely beautiful and intriguing golf course, Harbour Town is set in the
old oaks and then flirts with the Calibogue Sound for the finishing holes.
Harbour Town is a great spot to vacation and enjoy world-class golf.
The PGA Tour’s Heritage Classic — now called the MCI Heritage — was first
played on this golf course in 1969. Harbour Town meanders through the
pines, leaving tight alleys where there’s not much room to drive your golf
ball. This course has some of the smallest greens on tour, which drives the
pros mad trying to figure out which club to hit to these elusive surfaces.
My memories of this golf course are many. One of the funniest was back in
the ’80s, when Bill Mallon (who was on the tour then — he’s now a doctor)
and I were the first guys off the tee on Sunday’s round in the tournament. We
weren’t playing that well, so we decided we’d try to see how fast we could
play the round. I was the last to putt on the 18th and holed a 6-footer for 75,
which tied Bill, in the time of 1 hour, 37 minutes, and 15 seconds. We finished
the 18th hole when the group behind us was walking down the 9th fairway.
And they say PGA Tour players are slow. . . .
Long Cove Golf Club (Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina)
Long Cove is a great course that I get to play when we go to Hilton Head
Island to broadcast the MCI Heritage for CBS. A wonderful blend of water 
and trees that soothes and scares you at the same time, this venue will kick
your rear end if you’re not playing well — but it always does so in a dignified
manner.
315
Chapter 20: Gary’s Ten Favorite Courses

There’s something so relaxing about the place that I slow down when I pass
through the gates. Large yachts and alligators keep your interest as you
wander through this Pete Dye masterpiece.
If you’re ever lucky enough to be invited to this frolic in the forest, cast your
eyes toward the water off the 17th tee. If you squint hard enough, you may
see the iron that I threw in the lake one day — it’s sitting on the bottom along
with my golf ball. I never could hit the green with that 1-iron. Let it rest.

 Seeing some of the best public courses around
 Finding courses you may want to play someday
G
reat courses anyone can play? In addition to Pebble Beach, Pinehurst
No. 2, and the other public-access courses in Chapter 20, I’ve found
superb public golf all over the country — from north to south and coast to
coast, from tee to shining tee.
Alvamar Golf Course (Lawrence,
Kansas)
I won the Kansas Open at Alvamar Golf Course when I was a mere lad, and I
remember it as one of the finest-conditioned golf courses I had ever seen in
my life. Alvamar is set on rolling hills, and my putter was on fire. I really like
places where I’ve won, because they’re few and far between.
Go to Kansas and look up this course. Maybe they’ve got my name on a
plaque or something. Tell the employees that I sent you — I don’t believe
you’ll regret your trek.
Bethpage State Park, the Black Course
(Farmingdale, New York)
Bethpage State Park on Long Island, just east of New York City, has two of 
the best state-park courses in the United States. But the Black Course is the
crown jewel. The course is a treat to play — it’s a real challenge, and the
greens fees won’t bust your credit line. For decades there were rumblings

that this place could hold a golf event of major proportions one day. It finally
happened in 2002, when the U.S. Open came to the Black Course. That so-
called “People’s Open” was such a success that the Open will return to
Bethpage in 2009.
This municipal layout by A. W. Tillinghast, rejuvenated by Rees Jones before
the ’02 Open, is a grand design that catches the attention of well-seasoned
players and offers novices a place to grow and learn the game.
Cog Hill No. 4 (Lemont, Illinois)
Cog Hill is one of the great golf complexes in the United States. The Western
Open was held here for years. Now it’s the Cialis Western Open, but tour pros
still flock to this place with nothing but nice things to say about it. That’s a
rarity on the PGA Tour nowadays.
Cog Hill has a great layout and could host a major event without doing much
to the course. If you want to really find out how your game is, try Cog Hill No.
4 from the back trees. Bring along some provisions — you’re going to be out
there a while. They don’t call the course “Dub’s Dread” for nothing.
Grayhawk Golf Club, Talon and 
Raptor (Scottsdale, Arizona)
Grayhawk opened in 1995. Situated in the higher desert of north Scottsdale,
this beautiful public facility has it all: a great clubhouse, two championship
golf courses, a great practice facility, and me. That’s right: Peter Kostis and I
run a golf school at Grayhawk Golf Club. Phil Mickelson and Howard Twitty
also represent Grayhawk on tour. You can see why I’m a little prejudiced
about our place.
The service at this place has to be seen to be believed. You’ll be treated like
you just won the Masters. The golf courses are also superb, with Phoenix and
the McDowell Mountains making for a spectacular setting.
If you ever get out to Phoenix, come up the hill and join us at Grayhawk for
fun in the sun. You never know, Phil Mickelson may be around, and we can
get him to buy us a beer!
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The Homestead, Cascades Course 
(Hot Springs, Virginia)
The Homestead is one of the most peaceful settings you’ll ever experience.
This old golf facility — the first course was built in 1892 — has a certain civil-
ity about it. Grandeur is everywhere, and the course is fantastic. Settle in and
enjoy the lifestyle.
I recommend seeing this beauty in October or early November, when the
scenery is unbelievable. Take a few friends with you and spend at least 
three or four days at the Homestead.
Ocean Course (Kiawah Island, 
South Carolina)
This Pete Dye gem was the setting of the famed “War by the Shore” Ryder
Cup matches in 1991, and later provided scenes for the movie The Legend 
of Bagger Vance. The Ocean Course at Kiawah winds through dunes and
marshes, with views of the Atlantic from all 18 holes.
I’ll be testing my swing and my nerves here in 2007, when the Ocean Course
hosts the Senior PGA Championship. Five years later, the course gets a PGA
Tour major: the 2012 PGA Championship.
Pinon Hills Golf Course (Farmington,
New Mexico)
Finding Farmington, New Mexico, takes some doing, but once there, you’ll see
the outstanding Pinon Hills Golf Course laid out in the high mesas of New
Mexico. The views from anywhere on the course are spectacular.
Pinon Hills is probably the best bargain on earth. The last report we got of
the greens fee was $38 on the weekend, $33 on weekdays, and you can walk
anytime. For $445.50 — about what it costs to play Pebble Beach once — 
you can buy a pass and play all year! So grab a friend and get to Farmington;
they’re waiting for you, and you don’t need a lot of pesos to have fun.
319
Chapter 21: Gary’s Ten Favorite Public Courses

San Luis Rey Downs (Bonsall,
California)
San Luis Rey Downs is not the prettiest course in the world. It’s not the best
maintained either. But it is the place where I sharpened my clubs and my wit
for the PGA Tour. Just up the road from Hellhole Canyon (no kidding), San
Luis Rey Downs was full of scoundrels who would make any kind of bet, as
long as they had an edge. Jimmy the Greek would’ve loved the place.
San Luis Rey Downs sits in a river bottom that fills up whenever Southern
California has one of its rare wet spells. The bar is a melting pot of horse
owners, trainers, and jockeys from the thoroughbred training facility located
across the street. Mix them with public-fee golfers, and you get a rodeo of fun.
This course is the place where I plagiarized most of my weird TV lines.
Everybody had a nickname, and a few golfers had served time. San Luis Rey
Downs was the place where my friends hung out, and I enjoyed every minute
of their company. After you play this game long enough, you learn that you
can play the best-looking, most immaculately conditioned golf course in the
world, but if you don’t enjoy the company, the course’s condition doesn’t
matter. I enjoy San Luis Rey Downs.
Torrey Pines Golf Course, South 
Course (San Diego, California)
Torrey Pines is the site of the PGA Tour’s Buick Invitational. Since 2000, the
winners there include Phil Mickelson (twice), Tiger Woods (twice), and John
Daly. Nice pedigree, huh? A great public golf course, Torrey is well maintained
and offers a challenge for any golfer. The South Course serves up many long
and demanding holes that are tougher than the winds kicked up by the
Pacific Ocean.
You can see the ocean from all over the course, and you get a really good
look as you walk along the cliff on No. 4. Colorful hang gliders fill the sky.
During the fall, you may see whales migrating to Mexico. You have to do 
a lot to concentrate on the golf at Torrey.
The city of San Diego has a real gem in Torrey Pines. At almost any time of
year, you can enjoy the golf and sunshine.

Tournament Players Club (TPC) at
Sawgrass, Stadium Course (Ponte 
Vedra Beach, Florida)
Our flagship golf course — the most famous of the chain of fine Tournament
Players Clubs — is a beauty. Pete Dye conjured up this course from his caul-
dron. Carved out of the trees and swamps in north Florida, near Jacksonville,
this course plays host to one of the biggest PGA Tour events of the year —
the Players Championship. This event has the best field of any tournament
we play on tour, and the course provides a wonderful challenge.
321
Chapter 21: Gary’s Ten Favorite Public Courses
Public golf goes big-time
Good news: The largest area of growth in golf in
recent years has been in public, not private,
courses. Lots of those courses come to you cour-
tesy of your state, county, or city government —
proof that your tax dollars are hard at work.
Actually, golf courses can be a big source of rev-
enue, which is one reason governments build
them.
The courses are better built these days. Forget
the old image of worn and tattered municipal
links. Chances are, a quality public course offer-
ing bargain rates is within an easy drive from
your home. Fees are low, and most facilities offer
a range of amenities from clubhouses to carts
(not that you’d want to use a cart, would you?).
Public golf isn’t just for homebodies, either.  If
you’re interested in traveling, you can enjoy a
fun, inexpensive vacation by touring the courses
at America’s best open-to-everyone facilities.
One good example is the Robert Trent Jones Golf
Trail in Alabama. Built by — guess who? —
Robert Trent Jones, that grandmaster of greens
design, this string of courses offers the same bril-
liant planning and layout features of Jones’s
most famous sites. The idea was such a hit that
it was widely imitated. There’s now an Audubon
Golf Trail in Louisiana, a Magnolia Golf Trail in
Mississippi, and even a Lewis and Clark Golf Trail
in North Dakota.
The Trent Jones Trail in Alabama runs the length
of the state and offers classic 54-hole spreads
as well as a selection of par-3 courses for
golfers looking for the chance to develop their
skills on layouts that offer real character. Each
course is different and reflects the distinctive
topography of its location. And last I heard, each
course charges between $37 and $75. How’s
that for a deal too good for a cash-conscious
golf traveler to pass up?
Great-value public courses throughout the
country offer charm and challenge to spare —
and I’m not just talking about the golf trails or my
personal favorites. Maybe you’ll discover one or
two favorites of your own.

I remember that, when I first saw this place, I couldn’t believe the difficulty of
the golf course. I went home to San Luis Rey Downs and told the boys about
the fright that possessed me on every hole. Through the years, the staff has
made many refinements to the course, and in 1995, Greg Norman shot 24 under
par to clobber the field. So the course can be had, and if you get a chance to
play it, you’ll be had, too. The TPC at Sawgrass is a marvelous facility with one
of the most famous holes on earth — the par-3 17th with its island green. You
can watch for yourself when the best players in the world test their nerves
there every spring.

T
hese individuals play the game of golf at a different level. The course
turns into their canvas as they display a certain panache in going about
their work. To watch people of this caliber is to gaze upon the brightest of
stars. They play the game as it was meant to be played. I have played with
some of them and have heard stories about the others. They all wrote their
own scripts and have set themselves apart from the norm. They’ve got game.
Walter Hagen
“Sir Walter” won the PGA Championship five times, the British Open four
times, and the U.S. Open twice. While doing so, he redefined the role of the
professional golfer in society. Before Hagen, the golf pro was low on the food
chain. He was never allowed to walk through the front door of the clubhouse
and was certainly never seen socializing with members.

Hagen changed all that with his game and his flamboyant personality. The
public took him to heart. He would arrive at the course in a limousine, park
next to the clubhouse he was barred from entering, and then have his chauf-
feur serve lunch in the back of the car. Not just any lunch: Full complements
of wine and silver settings were the norm.
Hagen played golf with kings and queens, dukes and duchesses. On one
famous occasion, he asked King Edward VIII to tend the flag for him: “Hey,
Eddie, get the stick, will you?”
Hagen elevated himself to full celebrity, and the golfing world never looked
the same again. Sir Walter really could play the game, and he was the first to
make his living doing only that.
Fairway Louie
I went to school with this brilliant sage. He took seven years to get out of
Riverside City College, a two-year college, but he eventually got it right.
Fairway Louie got his master’s from some faraway college and is now manag-
ing an avocado orchard in the hills of Bonsall, California. He lives in a mobile
home and wears a lot of flannel, but he’s still my friend. He took me to my
first rock concert, showed me how to cheat on tests, and came to my first
wedding. I’ve known Fairway a long time.
He is the on-again, off-again president of a course where I grew up. That’s the
only way he can play for nothing. He advised me to quit the tour many years
ago — a wiser man I do not know. We see each other rarely nowadays, and I
miss his dialogue. He is a voice of reason in days of madness.
Phil Mickelson
For years, fans loved him for his go-for-broke style. They loved him even
more after he worked like crazy to improve, learning to play the percentages
under pressure, and won the 2004 Masters. That victory, Phil’s first in a
major, was one of the most popular in recent history. He grabbed another
major at the 2005 PGA Championship and looks poised to keep galleries root-
ing for him for years to come.
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Jack Nicklaus
He simply was the one I grew up watching as he won and won and won.
Mac O’Grady
A paragraph cannot do our relationship justice. Mac showed me how to
really understand this game. He knows more about the golf swing than
anyone else I have ever met. He is a man of many complexities and much con-
jecture. He has a passion for the game and for life. My own existence has
been immeasurably enhanced by his friendship.
Arnold Palmer
No one man has been more responsible for making golf the huge success that
it is today than Arnold Palmer. He came to the tour swinging hard at every
shot, never laying up, and always (it seemed) getting his golf ball out of trou-
ble when it appeared that he was doomed to fail. He was flamboyant and
charismatic, with a swagger that galleries flocked to see. And he happened
along in the early days of golf on television. The nation had a new hero.
Arnie was responsible for all the attention that golf got in those early cathode-
ray moments. He held our banner and set us on a new course for marketing.
Golf — or any sport, for that matter — could not have had a better
spokesman. He is, and always will be, the king.
Sam Snead
Sam started playing golf by carving up an old stick to resemble a club and
then whacking away at rocks on the West Virginia farm where he grew up.
What came of that youthful folly was the most natural-looking golf swing man
has ever devised. Sam’s swing is still the gold standard today.
Samuel Jackson Snead won 81 tournaments on the PGA Tour (though he told
everyone that he’d won more). His flair for telling jokes and leaping up to kick
the tops of doorjambs around the world’s clubhouses are legendary. I had the
opportunity to play and practice with Sam in his last years on tour. I will
never forget those moments.
325
Chapter 22: Gary’s Ten All-Time Favorite Male Players

Titanic Thompson
Golf has a way of attracting gamblers of all kinds. There’s none more leg-
endary than Titanic Thompson. I have encountered very few of my peers who
have not heard of or played a long-ago round of golf with this famous odds
maker. As I understand it, Titanic would make bets that he had no way of
losing, no matter how ridiculous they seemed. He roamed with the rich and
famous during the middle of the 20th century and supplied us with stories we
will tell deep into the 21st. He lived by his wits and imagination and added to
the lore of golf.
Lee Trevino
In 1967, a 27-year-old Mexican American came out of nowhere to finish fifth in
the U.S. Open. He didn’t go back to El Paso, where he lived, but stayed to play
a few more tournaments. He won enough money to stay on tour. “How long
has this been going on?” he asked in jest.
He has been on and around the tour ever since. Our lives have been richer
for Lee Trevino’s presence. A nonstop conversationalist, Lee talked his way
through 27 tour victories, stopped off at NBC for a while to do some announc-
ing, and then went on to the Champions Tour, where he still competes.
The man has an unequalled flair for words and shot making. He takes this
sometimes staid game and makes it fun. I hope we see another golfer like 
him in the future; he is a pleasure to watch and listen to.
Tiger Woods
Sure, he’s the game’s biggest star. But there’s more than star power behind
the phenomenon that is Tiger Woods. There’s the competitive fire that makes
him one of the hardest workers in the game, a golfer who never gives up.
There’s the brilliant short game that often escapes the notice of casual fans.
And there’s the will that makes him believe he can win every time out. Most
pro golfers are in their primes during their 30s — that’s almost scary, given
that Tiger, with 10 majors to his credit, turned 30 on December 30, 2005.

W
omen are embracing the sport of golf in growing numbers. In fact,
more than 20 percent of today’s golfers are women, and they play an
average of 16 rounds of golf a year.
The dominance of some of these fine athletes has secured women’s golf in
the pantheon of sports. Babe Zaharias is considered by some to be the great-
est athlete — male or female — who ever lived. Kathy Whitworth has won
more tournaments than anybody else who has ever picked up a golf club.
These women have shown the world that they can play this game, and they
have done it with dignity and élan. They’re the ones who blazed a trail for
Michelle Wie and millions of others to follow. Now millions of even younger
girls can follow Michelle into the game.

JoAnne Carner
This outgoing Hall of Famer is one of the reasons the LPGA became a popular
major sport. “Big Mama,” as she is called, is one of the greatest personalities
the women’s tour has ever known. She has won 42 events and was the tour’s
leading money winner 3 separate times. The LPGA has long been enriched by
her performance as one of the game’s true ambassadors.
Laura Davies
Laura was one of the dominant figures on the women’s tour for years. Her
enormous power reduced championship courses to mere pitch-and-putt
status. She has an engaging way about her and is still a blast to watch as she
destroys golf courses. She has won 20 times through 2005, including 4
majors, and she lights up the faces of galleries worldwide.
Juli Inkster
A Californian with an infectious smile, Juli was inducted into the LPGA Hall of
Fame in 1999. In 1982, she became the first golfer, male or female, to win three
consecutive U.S. amateur titles. The 1984 Rookie of the Year went on to win
30 times on tour, with 7 majors to her credit, including the U.S. Women’s
Open in 1999 and 2002 and back-to-back victories in the 1999–2000
McDonald’s LPGA Championships.
Nancy Lopez
Nancy constantly has a smile on her face and plays the game with youthful
zest. An outstanding representative of the LPGA, she is one of the great put-
ters in golf history. She won 48 times including 3 majors, and while she isn’t
playing as much these days, Nancy still adds life to everyone around her.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Meg Mallon
Meg joined the LPGA in 1987. She flirts with the golf course as she plays it,
always trying something new to see if it will help her play better. Viewers can
see the fun she has playing the game; that’s why I like to watch Meg. Her
most productive year was 1991, when she won two major titles. She has 18
wins in total, including the 2004 U.S. Women’s Open.
Annika Sorenstam
This highly disciplined individual is one of the hardest workers in our sport.
A native of Stockholm, Sweden, Annika has won 68 times with 9 majors — 
and counting — through 2005. In 2001, she shot a historic 59 in an LPGA
event. The perennial player of the year is a perfectionist whose work ethic 
is esteemed by her peers. She is the first woman to have an annual scoring
average under 70. She has inspired millions of girls to take up the game, and
is widely regarded as the finest female player of her time, if not all time.
Kathy Whitworth
Of all the people who have played this game — male or female — Kathy
Whitworth has won more times than anybody else. In her glorious career, she
won 88 times, including 6 major championships. She dominated the tour from
1965 to 1973, finishing first on the money list eight times and second once.
She was named player of the year seven times.
Michelle Wie
Like Tiger Woods, Michelle started playing at an early age — she was 4 years
old — and excelled in a hurry. The pride of Hawaiian golf shot a 64 at age 10
and grew into a slender 6-footer who can bomb a drive more than 300 yards
without visible effort. After turning pro just before her 16th birthday in
October 2005, she set her sights on the game’s highest level. If she continues
to hone her game, Michelle might well become one of golf’s biggest stars.

Mickey Wright
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Mickey Wright was responsible for raising
women’s professional golf to a new level and placing it in the public eye. I was
fortunate enough to see her play an exhibition match many years ago. I had
heard so much about her golf swing — and I was not disappointed. She may
have the best swing of anybody who’s ever played this game. An 82-time
winter, Mickey Wright ranks with Annika Sorenstam, Babe Zaharias, and a few
others as one of the greatest players the LPGA has ever known. In her prime,
she might have been the very best.
Babe Zaharias
Perhaps the most talented athlete of all time, Babe Didrikson Zaharias won
two gold medals and one silver medal in track and field in the 1932 Olympics.
Earlier that year, she won eight of ten events in the AAU’s National Women’s
Track and Field Championship and won the meet as a one-woman team for
Employer’s Casualty. She then decided to take up golf. Among her achieve-
ments was being one of 13 founders of the LPGA. In a very brief LPGA career—
lasting 8 years — she won 31 events and 10 major titles. She became a legend
beyond the sport of golf, but she died of cancer at the early age of 45.

The (More Than) Ten Worst 
Golf Disasters
In This Chapter
 From blown leads . . .
 . . . to missed putts
In golf, there’s no place to hide. And that’s the honor of it. The quarterback
who’s having a disgraceful day can retire to the bench. The batter who fears
Randy Johnson can fake an injury. But the golfer who’s brave enough to
reach the lead has an extra kind of courage; he knows that, having gotten to
center stage, there’s no limit to how much he can disgrace himself.
—Thomas Boswell
Oops!
—Jean Van de Velde
G
olf has to be the easiest sport in which to snatch defeat from the jaws
ofvictory. The game can be positively diabolical — the worst always
seems to happen, and complacency is severely punished. Ultimately, it’s not
whether the wheels come off, but when. Why do we delight in these deba-
cles? I think there’s a strong element of schadenfreude, a sort of perverse
consolation, when the greats occasionally suffer the humiliation and heart-
break that we regular mortals deal with every day. And that’s the key, I think:
Awful as they are, these meltdowns happen to the best players on the planet.
A word on terminology: I prefer disaster to collapse. A collapse is your fault,
but a disaster is something beyond your control, like a flood or an earth-
quake. Also, there’s a fine line between “choking” and being the victim of a
disaster. Choking is somehow culpable: Miss a 3-footer to win a major, and it’s
your fault. In any case, it’s devastating when disasters happen, and nobody is
immune — not even the best players in the world at the top of their game.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Jean Van de Velde, 1999 British Open 
at Carnoustie
France’s best golfer had it made. With a 3-stroke lead as he stood on the final
tee, Van de Velde knew that a double-bogey 6 was all he needed to win the
Claret Jug — and change his life forever. Instead, he would need to change his
pants. After his second shot bounced off a grandstand, he dunked a tricky
pitch shot into Barry Burn — the stream near the 18th green at Carnoustie.
Then the real comedy began.
Removing his shoes and socks, he waded into the water, planning to hit his
ball out (see Figure 24-1). But thought better of it. He took a penalty drop,
knocked his next shot into a greenside bunker, blasted out and finally made 
a tough putt for a 7. For a moment he was thrilled — at least he’d made a
playoff!
Of course he lost the playoff. Paul Lawrie won, and Van de Velde could only
shake his head. “Can I go out and play it again?” he asked.

Velde got

Carnoustie.

Greg Norman, 1996 Masters
The greatest disaster in golf history happened to the reigning number-one
player in the world. With more than 70 tournament victories worldwide, Greg
Norman is certainly the best player never to win a green jacket (the symbol
of a Masters victory), although he came close twice: In 1986, he bogied the
18th to lose by a stroke to Jack Nicklaus, and the following year he lost in a
playoff when Larry Mize chipped in from 50 yards. But his opening three
rounds at Augusta in 1996, including a record-tying 63 the first day, gave him
a seemingly invincible six-shot lead. (No one with such a lead going into the
final round had ever lost before.)
But on Sunday, he couldn’t do anything right. Norman bogied the 9th, 10th,
and 11th. He hit into the water on both 12 and 16 for double-bogey 5s. All
told, he missed 10 of 18 greens on his way to a 6-over-par 78. He lost to Nick
Faldo’s 5-under 67 by 5 shots, an incredible 11-shot turnaround.
Norman somehow managed to smile during the excruciating post-round
press conference. “God, I’d love to be up there putting that green jacket on,
but it’s not the end of the world,” he told reporters. “I’m disappointed, I’m
sad about it. I’m going to regret it, because I know I let it slip away. It’s not 
the end of my life.” He exhibited such dignity in the face of crushing disap-
pointment that he received thousands of cards and letters praising his
sportsmanship. He later described the outpouring of support as a transform-
ing experience, claiming that he took more from the loss than he would have
gained from a win.
Gil Morgan, 1992 U.S. Open 
at Pebble Beach
After opening rounds of 66 and 69, the 45-year-old former optometrist had a
seven-shot lead when the wind started to gust off the Pacific. He double-
bogied the 8th, bogied the 9th, double-bogied the 10th, bogied the 11th and
12th, and double-bogied the 14th. Though he managed to birdie 16 and 18, his
lead was reduced to one shot. He shot 81 on Sunday for a tie for 13th. He
never came as close to winning a PGA Tour major. “I kind of fell out of the
sky,” he said later. “It felt like my parachute had a hole in it.”

Chapter 24: The (More Than) Ten Worst Golf Disasters

Mark Calcavecchia, 1991 Ryder Cup 
at Kiawah Island
Calcavecchia was four up with four holes to play in his singles match against
Colin Montgomerie. He lost the 15th and 16th, and then, at the par-3 17th,
after Montgomerie hit his tee shot into the water and all he had to do was put
his ball somewhere on dry land, Calcavecchia topped his tee ball into the
water. He then missed a 2-foot putt, which would still have given him the win.
All told, he made two triples and two bogies to lose the final four holes and
halve (tie) the match, when a win would have clinched a victory for the
United States. Fortunately for Calcavecchia’s subsequent mental health, 
the United States won the Ryder Cup anyway.
Patty Sheehan, 1990 U.S. Women’s
Open at Atlanta Athletic Club
With the last two rounds being played on Sunday, Sheehan took a nine-shot
lead into the final 27 holes but lost to Betsy King by one stroke. Most col-
lapses are mental, but in Sheehan’s case, the breakdown was physical. “I had
no fuel on board when I went out [Sunday morning],” she said. “I started
losing it. I was dehydrated. My body couldn’t work. I couldn’t think properly
and I had no strength.”
Sheehan redeemed herself with victories in the 1993 and 1994 U.S. Opens. “It
doesn’t hurt anymore,” she said. “Thank God I was able to win and get rid of
all the demons.”
Scott Hoch, 1989 Masters
You’re never safe — certainly not when you’re nervous, and apparently not
even when you’re calm: On the 10th green of a playoff with Nick Faldo, Hoch
missed a 2-footer to win the Masters, and lost the playoff on the following
hole.
Later, Hoch expounded on the nightmare: “I was so at ease. I just knew the way
things had transpired all week, especially that day, that the tournament was
mine. I took it for granted. Standing over that putt, I didn’t feel a thing. Nothing.
It was like I was out there during a practice round. Why, I don’t know. And I’ve
never felt like that since. That’s why, when the putt missed, it was more like,
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

wait a minute — destiny doesn’t happen like this. . . . I wasn’t thinking. My
mind was doing things it shouldn’t have been. It should’ve been strictly on 
that putt, nothing else. Then it was like, ‘Who am I going to go on with, Bryant
Gumbel or the other guy tomorrow morning?’ That kind of stuff. Then it was
the biggest surprise in the world to me when it didn’t go in. I’d been saying to
myself, ‘This is what it all comes down to — all the hardship and heartache all
comes to this moment. Finally.’ Then it crashed down on me.”
Jeff Sluman, 1987 Tournament Players
Championship at Sawgrass
Sluman and Sandy Lyle were in a sudden-death playoff, with Sluman facing a
5-footer on the 17th to win. Just as he was about to strike the putt, a specta-
tor dove into the lake surrounding the island green, causing the gallery to
break into cheers and catcalls. Sluman stepped back to compose himself and
then stepped up . . . and missed the cup completely. He bogied the next hole
to lose the playoff.
T. C. Chen, 1985 U.S. Open 
at Oakland Hills
After shooting 65-69-69, Taiwan’s Tze-Chung Chen carried a two-stroke lead
into the final round and boosted it to four by the time he reached the par-4
No. 5. After a good drive, he pushed a 4-iron into the trees and then hit his
third shot into thick greenside rough. He took a sand wedge for the short
chip, but the ball popped straight up and the clubhead somehow hit it again
in midair, sending it sideways and costing him a penalty stroke. Unnerved by
the double hit, he chipped onto the green and then two-putted for a quadruple-
bogey 8. He bogied the next three holes, losing the title to Andy North by a
single stroke and earning the ignominious nickname “Two Chips” Chen.
Hale Irwin, 1983 British Open 
at Royal Birkdale
On Saturday, in contention for the lead during the third round, Irwin whiffed a
2-inch tap-in on the par-3 14th. On Sunday, he lost the championship to Tom
Watson by one stroke. “I guess I lifted my head,” he said afterward, “because
my club just bounced over the ball.”
335
Chapter 24: The (More Than) Ten Worst Golf Disasters

Jerry Pate, 1982 World Series 
of Golf at Firestone
The 1976 U.S. Open champion reached the fringe of the par-5 2nd hole in two
and had a 50-footer for eagle. His approach putt rolled 5 feet past the hole,
and his comebacker for birdie was also too strong, ending up 3 feet away.
Annoyed at himself, Pate carelessly hit the short par putt, and it lipped out.
Fuming, he then made a careless backhand stab at the bogey tap-in. Not only
did the ball miss the cup, but it also hit his foot for a two-stroke penalty. Now
lying 8, he managed to hole out for a quadruple-bogey 9. “That was the stu-
pidest hole I ever played,” he said afterward. “It just goes to show you that in
golf, it’s never over until the ball is in the hole.”
Tommy Nakajima, 1978 Masters
The Japanese professional tried to cut the dogleg of the par-5 No. 13 at
Augusta National, but his drive caught a tree and his ball ended up in Rae’s
Creek. He took a penalty drop and played a 5-iron down the fairway, leaving
himself 100 yards to the green. When his wedge found the creek in front of
the green, he tried to hit it out rather than take a drop, but the ball popped
straight up and landed on his foot for a two-stroke penalty. Then when he
handed the muddy club to his caddie, it slipped from his grasp and fell into
the water for another two-stroke penalty for “grounding” a club in a hazard.
Lying 9, he hit his next shot over the green and then chipped back on and
two-putted for a 13, tying the record for the highest one-hole score in the his-
tory of the Masters.
Asked about it later, Nakajima replied, “I don’t like to recall unpleasant 
occurrences.”
Billy Casper, 1968 Bob Hope 
Desert Classic
Casper was two shots off the lead in the final round when he came to the 
par-3 4th hole. Just as he reached the top of his backswing, a spectator
slipped on the rocky hill above him, causing a landslide that startled Casper
into a cold shank. The resulting double-bogey 5 dashed his chance to win the
tournament.
336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Roberto DeVicenzo, 1968 Masters
Widely regarded as one of the nicest guys in professional golf, the 45-year-old
Argentinean began the final round two shots behind the leader and shot a siz-
zling 65. His playing partner and marker, Tommy Aaron (in pro events your
playing partner keeps your score and you keep his), mistakenly gave him a
par 4 on the 17th rather than a birdie 3, and DeVicenzo hastily signed the
incorrect card and submitted it to the official scorer. Because the Rules of
Golf state that a score card may not be changed after it has been turned in,
the 4 counted. Bob Goalby finished tied with DeVicenzo’s actual score, but
because of the error, Goalby won the Masters by one shot.
This incident, a “rules disaster,” was perhaps even more tragic than a stan-
dard on-course collapse — claiming not one but three victims: DeVicenzo;
Aaron, who would donate a vital organ if it could undo his blunder; and
Goalby, whose victory is forever tarnished as resting on a technicality. For his
part, DeVicenzo accepted his fate with good humor. At the awards ceremony,
he said, “What a stupid I am!”
Marty Fleckman, 1967 U.S. Open 
at Baltusrol
Twenty-three-year-old Marty Fleckman shot 67-73-69 in a bid to become the
first amateur to win the U.S. Open since Johnny Goodman (in 1933), but he
ballooned to an 80 in the final round and finished 18th. Asked by reporters
what happened, Fleckman replied, “I finally got back on my game.”
Arnold Palmer, 1966 U.S. Open 
at the Olympic Club
With a seven-stroke lead over Billy Casper and only nine holes left to play,
Palmer, in typical style, went for the U.S. Open record instead of playing it
safe. But he scored five over par on holes 10 through 17 and barely managed
to par the 18th hole to tie Casper, who shot 32 on the back nine. Palmer lost
the Monday playoff with a 73 to Casper’s 69. He never won another major.
After the obligatory post-tournament press conference, an official asked
Palmer if he wanted to leave by a back door to avoid the crowd waiting out-
side. He declined. “The way I played,” he said, “I deserve whatever they do to
me.” He was pleasantly surprised to find that his fans — “Arnie’s Army” —
were even more adoring than they would have been had he won.
337
Chapter 24: The (More Than) Ten Worst Golf Disasters

Arnold Palmer, 1961 Los Angeles Open
at Rancho Park
Palmer needed a par 5 on the 18th for a 69 in the second round. After a good
drive, instead of laying up with an iron for the tight second shot, he went for a
birdie and pushed a 3-wood out-of-bounds onto the adjacent driving range. He
paused briefly to regroup and then hit another 3-wood. O.B. right again. He
gathered himself again and hit another 3-wood. This time, he hooked it onto
Patricia Avenue. Stubborn if not downright foolhardy, Palmer hit the 3-wood
yet again, and again hooked it out-of-bounds. On the fifth try, after four straight
penalties, he finally put his 3-wood on the green and went on to make a 12. A
long, sad story. Arnie’s description was more succinct. Asked by a reporter
how he managed to make a 12, he replied, “I missed my putt for an 11.”
Billy Joe Patton, 1954 Masters
The affable young amateur from South Carolina found himself in the lead on
Sunday after a 32 on the front nine, which included a hole-in-one on the 6th.
When he reached the par-5 No. 13, he was told that his closest competitor,
Ben Hogan, had just made a double bogey on 11. All Patton had to do was
play it safe to become the first amateur to win the Masters. But no. Instead of
laying up to avoid Rae’s Creek, he went for the green, and his ball found the
water. He removed his shoes and socks and waded into the stream but recon-
sidered and decided to take a drop for a one-stroke penalty. Still barefoot, he
pitched onto the green and two-putted for a bogey 6. Patton then parred in
for a 290, one shot behind Hogan and Sam Snead (who defeated Hogan in a
playoff).
In retrospect, Patton claimed that he wouldn’t have played it any differently.
“I was elated to play as well as I did,” he said. “I’m almost delighted I lost, in
fact. Otherwise, I might have turned pro.”
Byron Nelson, 1946 U.S. Open 
at Canterbury
After his caddie accidentally kicked his ball, costing him a penalty stroke,
Nelson ended up tied with Lloyd Mangrum and Vic Ghezzi. He then lost to
Mangrum in a 36-hole playoff.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Sam Snead, 1939 U.S. Open 
at Spring Mill
Snead, who has won more PGA events than anyone else in history, is
undoubtedly the best player never to win a U.S. Open. He came close several
times: He lost by one stroke in 1937; he lost in a playoff in 1947; and at the
Spring Mill course at Philadelphia Country Club in 1939, before the advent of
electronic leader boards, he mistakenly thought he needed a birdie on the
par-5 final hole to win and went for the green in two. He hit his second shot
into a bunker and eventually made a triple-bogey 8 to lose by two strokes,
when a par would have won.
Ray Ainsley, 1938 U.S. Open 
at Cherry Hills
Ainsley, a club pro from Ojai, California, hit his approach on the par-4 16th
into a stream fronting the green. Rather than take a penalty, he decided to
play the ball from the water. As the ball drifted with the current, he slashed at
it repeatedly, stubbornly refusing to take a drop. He finally carded a 19, which
is still the U.S. Open record for the highest score on a single hole.

Chapter 24: The (More Than) Ten Worst Golf Disasters
From the self-inflicted department
Bobby Cruickshank, 1934 U.S. Open at Merion:
On the 11th hole during the final round,
Cruickshank’s second shot over a stream
skipped off the water and ran onto the green.
Jubilant, he threw his club in the air in celebra-
tion. He was knocked unconscious when it
came down on his head.
Al Capone, 1928: The Chicago gangster loved to
play golf, although he never shot under 100. But
one day in 1928, at the Burnham Woods course
near Chicago, he managed to shoot himself —
when the loaded revolver he kept in his bag
went off and wounded him in the foot.
Mary, Queen of Scots, 1587: The most irrevoca-
ble golf disaster in history involved Mary, Queen
of Scots, who angered Parliament by playing
golf a few days after her husband’s death. Her
apparent lack of wifely grief was used against
her at her trial for plotting the murder of Queen
Elizabeth I, and Mary was beheaded.

Roland Hancock, 1928 U.S. Open 
at Olympia Fields
Hancock, an unknown 21-year-old club pro from Wilmington, North Carolina,
reached the final two holes with a seemingly insurmountable lead. As he
approached the 17th tee, one of the spectators shouted, “Make way for the
next U.S. Open champion!” Hancock promptly double-bogied the 17th and
18th, missing a playoff by a single stroke.

organizations, as well as selected golf schools and other
resources.

Appendix A
Golf Speak
F
ive minutes of listening to the conversation in any clubhouse in the
world will be enough for you to figure out that golf has a language all its
own. Here are the phrases, terms, and slang of that language. Hey, if you’re
going to be a real golfer, you need to sound like one.
These terms are written with right-handed golfers in mind. Lefties will have to
think in reverse!
A
ace: A hole-in-one. Buy a round of drinks
for the house.
address: The positioning of your body in
relation to the ball just before starting your
swing. And your last conscious thought
before the chaos begins.
airball: Your swing missed the ball! Blame
it on an alien’s spacecraft radar.
albatross: British term for double eagle,
or three under par on one hole. I’ve only
had one.
amateur: Someone who plays for fun, not
money. Playing golf for fun?
angle of approach: The degree at which
the clubhead moves either downward or
upward into the ball. A severe test of
agility.
approach: Your shot to the green made
from anywhere except the tee. Sounds 
dangerous; really isn’t.
apron: The grass around the edge of a
green, longer than the grass on the green
but shorter than the grass on the fairway.
Or what I wear to barbecue in.
attend: To hold and remove the flagstick as
another player putts, usually from some

away: Term used to describe the ball far-
thest from the hole and, thus, next to be
played.
B

back lip: The edge of a bunker that’s far-
thest from the green.

of golf; the first half is the front nine holes.
backspin: When the ball hits the green and
spins back toward the player. Galleries
love backspins.
backswing: The part of the swing from the
point where the clubhead moves away
from the ball to the point where it starts
back down again. I hope that your back-
swing is smooth and in balance.
baffy: Old name for a lofted wood; short
for “baffing spoon.”
bail out (hang ’em high): You hit the shot,
for example, well to the right to avoid trou-
ble on the left.
balata: Sap from a tropical tree; most popu-
lar cover for balls until urethane came along

in still life.
ball marker: Small, round object, such as a
coin, used to indicate the ball’s position on
the green.

the end used to collect balls from water
hazards and other undesirable spots. If the

costs.

player to another. Receiver may choose
which hole it is applied to.
bite (vampire, bicuspid, overbite): A spin
that makes the ball tend to stop rather
than roll when it lands.

iron. See thin or skull.
blast: Aggressive shot from a bunker that
displaces a lot of sand.
blind shot: You can’t see the spot where
you want the ball to land.
