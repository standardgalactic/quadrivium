The Python documentation
That should be your top bookmark for Python
https://docs.python.org
Don't forget to make sure you are looking at your version of Python. 
3.6 or above please!

PEP – Python Enhancement Proposals
These are a fantastic resource to understand how certain things work in Python,
and why they were implemented in a certain way.. 
Index page
Not all PEPs actually make it into Python. Some are rejected, deferred or even withdrawn.
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/
But sometimes a web search such as: Python PEP Style Guide is more practical
search on that page
Reading the PEPs that have not been accepted also provides a lot of insight!
A lot of thought by many people go into these PEPs, whether they make it or not.
Some PEPs are for language features
some are informational only

PEP 8 – Style Guide and Idiomatic Python
PEP 20 – Zen of Python
or just type import this in a Python console/Jupyter
PEP – Some Notable Ones
PEP 484 – Type Hints
PEP 537 – Python 3.7 Release Schedule
or whatever release your interested in at the time
PEP 468 – Python 3.6 Release Schedule
they provide links to other PEPs relevant to the release
And many many more, depending on what topic you’re interested in

#python tip: zip() with star-arguments is 
great for transposing 2-D data: 
m = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)] 
list(zip(*m)) 
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
example:
Lots of great videos on Python.
