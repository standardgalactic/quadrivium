About the Author
Brian Fairrington is a nationally syndicated, award-winning editorial cartoon-
ist and illustrator and one of the few U.S. cartoonists whose political leanings 
are conservative. Brian began his career in the mid-1990s while he was a 
student at Arizona State University, where he began drawing cartoons for the 
student newspaper, the State Press.
Arizona State University is home to the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, 
one of the more prestigious journalism programs in the country. The news-
paper is part of that program but is independently operated by the students. 
During his undergraduate years at the State Press, Brian won every major 
national award, making him one of the most decorated cartoonists to come 
out of college. His honors include the John Locher Memorial Award, given 
by the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, and the Charles Schulz 
Award, given by the Scripps Howard Foundation. Brian is also the two-time 
winner of the Society of Professional Journalists Mark of Excellence Award, 
as well as a ten-time winner of the Gold Circle Award, presented by Columbia 
University’s Journalism School.
While still in college, Brian’s cartoons were nationally syndicated by the 
Scripps Howard News Service. After graduating, he became a cartoonist for 
the Arizona Republic and the East Valley Tribune, both in the Phoenix area. He 
then moved from Scripps Howard to become nationally syndicated by Cagle 
Cartoons, and his work is currently distributed to more than 800 newspapers, 
magazines, and Web sites. His cartoons have appeared in The New York 
Times and USA Today as well as on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News. Additionally, 
his cartoons regularly appear on MSNBC’s Cagle Cartoon Index, the most 
popular cartoon Web site on the Internet.
The in-your-face approach and conservative fl avor of Brian’s editorial car-
toons have brought him notice from fans and critics alike. His work has been 
the subject of editorials in the Wall Street Journal and numerous other publi-
cations. He was featured on MSNBC’s Imus in the Morning show and was most 
recently profi led on CBS News Sunday Morning. Brian is a regular guest on the 
Phoenix-based TV show Horizon, where one of his appearances garnered an 
Emmy Award for news programming.

Along with Daryl Cagle, Brian is the author and editor of The Best Political 
Cartoons of the Year series of books by Que Publishing. To date, Brian has 
published seven annual “best of” cartoon books featuring the best cartoons 
from all the top editorial cartoonists in the country.
Brian has done numerous illustrations and full-color artwork for such maga-
zines as The New Republic and Time, among others. A collection of Brian’s 
original cartoons is on display at the Ostrovsky Fine Art Gallery in Scottsdale, 
Arizona. An Arizona native, Brian resides there with his wife Stacey and their 
four children. He can be reached at bfair97@aol.com.

Dedication
This book is dedicated to all those individuals who love to draw and have 
grown up (and are still growing up) with a passion for drawing cartoons. 
Thank you to all the cartoonists who inspired me as a kid with all the won-
derful and fantastic art that made me want to follow in their footsteps. 
A special dedication goes out to all the cartoon fans who, though they may 
not be able to draw a straight line themselves, still appreciate the funny, 
strange, wacky, and sometimes serious world of cartooning. Cave drawings 
were the first cartoons, and it’s safe to say in the end that someone will prob-
ably draw a cartoon on the outside of the big bomb that blows up the world. 
Until that day, this book is dedicated to everyone who reads it. As we say in 
the cartoon world, “Kaboom!”
Acknowledgments
I have to thank Mike Lewis, the acquisitions editor for this book; Chad 
Sievers, my project editor; and the entire Wiley team for their assistance and 
patience. I want to thank my literary agent Barb Doyen for all her wonderful 
motherly advice. A huge thanks to Sharon Perkins for all the tremendous help 
she provided me on this project. I’d love to work with her again in the future.
I have to thank my wife Stacey, who has put up with all the late nights needed 
to draw the art and write this book on time (okay . . . never on time). Thanks 
also go out to my wonderful children: Chase, Hayden, Blake, and Lauren, and 
the 435,567 times they asked me, “What are you drawing?” Thanks to all my 
friends and extended family who haven’t seen me over the last six months 
and are probably wondering what happened to me. 
Lastly, I want to thank anyone who has ever run for political office or who is 
thinking about running for office. As long as you feed your egos and relent-
less thirst for power by entering the crazy world of politics, I will always have 
material.

Introduction
Y
ou may think cartooning is just for kids, but that’s far from the truth! 
Cartooning is a highly lucrative enterprise. Cartoons influence the way 
people look at political and world events, they make people think, and they help 
people laugh at themselves. Cartooning is more than just funny characters telling 
jokes — it’s a snapshot of real-life situations where you, the cartoonist, can share 
your opinion about life and its endless interesting situations. Being able to draw 
is only one facet of being a good cartoonist. Being able to get across a compelling 
point with just a few pen strokes and to add the details that make your cartoons 
stand out from the pack is equally important. This book shows you how.
About This Book
This book is for people interested in drawing cartoons, whether they’re 
novices unsure where to start or pros who want to improve their art or find 
better ways to market themselves. Every top-selling cartoonist in the world 
started out as a beginner. It takes time, practice, and some talent to become 
a successful cartoonist, but it also takes determination and the desire to stick 
to it until you become good at it.
More important, this book can show you how to create your very own cartoon 
characters in a fun environment. I give you step-by-step instructions on how 
to create not just human cartoon characters, but others like cars, animals, and 
other creatures. You may even decide to make an unusual inanimate object your 
main character! And because cartooning is more than just drawing, I also give 
step-by-step instructions on how to come up with ideas and color your cartoons.
Conventions Used in This Book
Every For Dummies book has certain conventions to make it easier for you to get 
the information you need. Here are some of the conventions I use in this book:
 
✓ Whenever I introduce a new technical term, I italicize it and then define it.
 
✓ I use bold text to highlight keywords or the main parts of bulleted and 
numbered lists.
 
✓ The Internet is a wealth of information on everything from the history of 
cartooning to great sites to buy expensive supplies for less. Web sites 
appear in monofont to help them stand out.

Drawing Cartoons & Comics For Dummies 
What You’re Not to Read
In today’s busy world you may be juggling a full-time job, your better half, 
kids and pets, friends and family, and a wide assortment of other responsibili-
ties. You don’t have much free time. In aspiring to improve your cartooning 
abilities, you simply want the essential info to help you. If that’s the case, 
feel free to skip the sidebars — those boxes shaded in light gray. Sidebars 
present interesting (I hope!) supplemental info that helps you gain a better 
appreciation of the topic, but the info isn’t essential to understand the topic, 
so you won’t miss anything if you skip them.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I make a few assumptions about you:
 
✓ You want to know more about cartooning in general.
 
✓ You want to know how to draw some common cartoon characters and 
make them interesting.
 
✓ You want to know how to liven up your cartoon backgrounds and settings.
 
✓ You may be interested in a career as a cartoonist.
Note: If you’re looking for a complete art course, this book isn’t for you. 
Although I give specific, step-by-step examples of how to draw basic char-
acters and backgrounds, I assume you already know how to pick up a pencil 
and draw basic shapes. You also won’t find a complete art history here, 
although I do give quite a bit of cartoon history throughout the book.
How This Book Is Organized
For Dummies books are written in a modular fashion. This format gives 
you the option of reading the book from beginning to end, or alternatively, 
selecting certain parts or chapters that are relevant to your interests or 
experience. I organize this book to start with the basics and build up to the 
more advanced concepts. The following describe each part in more detail.
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting 
Started with Cartoons and Comics
Part I is all about getting familiar with the nuts and bolts of cartooning. What 
art supplies do you need to get started? How can you set up a workspace

 Introduction
that’s efficient without breaking the bank? Can you draw cartoons at the 
kitchen table with nothing more than a number 2 pencil? What’s the first 
thing you do when you sit in front of a blank piece of paper?
This part answers those questions and then leads you into the harder ques-
tions: What types of cartoons are you interested in drawing? How do you 
develop your characters? And the oft-asked and hard-to-answer question: 
Where do you get your ideas?
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters
Part II is all about drawing and developing characters. The chapters in this part 
teach you to draw your characters starting from their heads right down to their 
toes, whether your characters are people, animals, or inanimate objects. I also 
look at the fine art of satirizing the political landscape with editorial cartoons.
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: 
Assembling the Parts
Cartooning is much more than talking heads and word balloons. Creating a 
background perspective that adds detail and interest, deciding how to letter 
your cartoons, and setting a scene that enhances your cartoons without 
interfering with your main point are all part of what I cover in this part.
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking 
Your Cartoons to the Next Level
Part IV goes deeper into the cartooning world. I look at the impact comput-
ers have had on the cartooning world, and I describe tools and toys available 
today to help you fine-tune your work, like Photoshop. If you want to make 
this your life’s work, this part gives you the tools you need to evaluate your 
work and find out if you have what it takes to make it in the big time.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books contain the Part of Tens section, which gives you fun, 
helpful information in easily digestible chunks. In this part I review ten steps to 
creating a finished cartoon, from first pencil stroke to final product. I also help 
you launch your new career with ten steps to breaking into the cartooning world.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, I use icons in the margins to highlight valuable infor-
mation and advice. Here’s what each one means:
 
This icon points out something that’s important to remember, whether you’re 
a novice cartoonist or a more experienced one.
 
This icon indicates helpful hints, shortcuts, or ways to improve your 
cartooning.
 
I use this icon to alert you to information that can keep you from making big 
mistakes!
 
The text associated with this icon goes into technical details that aren’t neces-
sary to your understanding of the topic but that may appeal to those who 
want more in-depth information.
 
The info that this icon highlights isn’t essential, but I hope these anecdotes 
about the world of cartooning help you appreciate just how rich that world is.
Where to Go from Here
If you want to know every single thing about cartooning, start at the begin-
ning of the book and read straight through. However, you don’t need to read 
the book in sequence. You may be looking for specific info on certain aspects 
of cartooning, in which case you can refer to the table of contents or the 
index to find the subject you want. Each chapter is meant to stand alone, and 
the info each contains isn’t dependent on your reading previous chapters to 
understand it.
If you’re brand new to cartooning and aren’t sure where to start, Chapter 2 
helps you understand the different cartoon genres and choose the genre 
that best suits your interests. If you’re a beginning cartoonist and need some 
drawing pointers, jump into Chapter 4 and start with the drawing basics. 
If you’re already drawing but want to improve your characters, check out 
Chapters 6 and 7.

In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the various cartooning genres
▶ Understanding some drawing basics
▶ Considering the future of cartooning
S
o you want to be a cartoonist? Or maybe you already consider yourself 
a cartoonist — and a darn good one — but you don’t have the slightest 
idea how to market your work. Or perhaps you just enjoy drawing and you’d 
like to become better at it.
If you want to draw cartoons, you’re not alone. Right about now, thousands 
of budding cartoonists are doodling on any scrap of paper they can find, 
dreaming of breaking into the cartooning business someday. And who’s to 
say you won’t be the next Charles Schulz or create the next Garfield? One 
thing’s for certain: If you’re a cartoonist with something to say and you get 
your point across well, you can — thanks to the Internet — be published any-
time and anywhere, even if it’s just on your own Web site or blog.
Many people draw well, but they aren’t sure how to adapt their drawings for 
the cartoon or comics market. Others have new ideas, but they draw some-
what crudely and need help pulling a cartoon together. Whether you’re brand 
new to cartooning and want to experiment with different characters and set-
tings to create your first strip, or you’ve been drawing for quite a while and 
want some helpful advice to improve your characters, you’re probably look-
ing for someone to give you a few pointers. You’ve come to the right place.
This chapter serves as your jumping-off point into the world of cartooning. 
Here I give you an overview of cartooning and the different cartooning genres 
that I cover in this book, I show you how to master the drawing basics, and 
I discuss how cartoons are marketed and how those markets are evolving. If 
you’ve always wanted to be a cartoonist, this chapter gives you the skinny.

Understanding the Different Genres
To be a cartoonist, you need a firm grasp of the different types of cartoons 
and comics in today’s market. I discuss several in this book. Some categories 
that were once popular now face challenges with the ever-changing market, 
especially traditional comic strips and editorial cartoons that are married to 
newsprint.
However, other forms of cartooning that were once off the beaten track have 
exploded in popularity; they include webcomics, editorial cartoons on the 
Internet, graphic novels, and comic books. The traditional markets are chang-
ing, and the new markets provide an exciting opportunity for cartoonists to 
get in on the ground floor of cartooning’s future.
 
If you love to draw cartoons and are thinking about trying to become a profes-
sional cartoonist, study the categories in the sections that follow and the 
details about each. Do you have to stick to just one genre? No, but many car-
toonists do, which helps their work become identifiable. Check out Chapter 2 
for more on different genres and how to work within them. No matter what 
type of cartooning you may be interested in, it all begins with the basics of 
drawing and character development. Great ideas and great character develop-
ment are what make animation in all its forms continue to be popular (refer to 
Chapter 4 for drawing basics).
Following familiar characters: 
Comic strips
When you think of cartooning, comic strips may be the first thing that pops 
into your mind. Comic strips are basically a satirical look into the lives 
of the characters that inhabit them. Comic strips often reflect the subtle 
truths about our own lives in their observations and insights into the world 
around us. Comic strips have the longest continuing run of popularity among 
cartooning genres, largely because people like to follow their favorite char-
acters. This genre historically has been a staple and popular feature in news-
papers. As newspapers face market challenges and try to adapt and evolve, 
popular Web-based comic strips have popped up all over the Internet.
Modern comic strips were first created at the turn of the 20th century as a 
way to attract readers to newspapers. Comic strips appeared on the scene 
long before other forms of entertainment media — like radio, movies, and 
TV — became popular.

 Chapter 1: The Skinny on Cartoons and Comics
Expressing a viewpoint: Editorial cartoons
Editorial cartoons are a popular and sometimes very controversial form of 
cartooning. Editorial cartoons are simply cartoons written to express a politi-
cal or social viewpoint. They also first appeared on the scene about the same 
time as the modern newspaper gained widespread popularity.
Early newspaper publishers used editorial cartoons the same way they used 
comic strips — to attract readers. Editorial cartoonists in the early part of 
the 20th century were the media celebrities of their day. Their cartoons 
preceded TV by several decades and were a source of information and enter-
tainment for readers. Editorial cartoons of that era were very influential, 
even influencing political elections and reforms. From Thomas Nast and his 
exposure of corruption in the underbelly world of New York politics to the 
Washington Post’s Herbert Block (better known as Herblock) landing on 
Nixon’s enemies’ list during the Watergate scandal — and up to the scathing 
criticisms of the war in Iraq — editorial cartoons have played and continue to 
play an important role in the annals of political discourse.
Editorial cartoons have evolved over the last century and remain very popu-
lar today. However, market realities are challenging for new editorial cartoon-
ists. The profession has traditionally been tied to print journalism, and in the 
past few years, newspapers have had massive layoffs and cutbacks. But like 
comic strips, editorial cartoons are thriving on the Internet, and unlike their 
print counterparts, the Web versions are done in full color, and some are 
even animated. Check out Chapter 11 for more info on editorial cartoons.
Delivering the punch line: Gag cartoons
Gag cartoons are another popular category. Gag cartoons may look similar to 
comic strips, but in fact they’re quite different. Unlike comic strips, most gag 
strips don’t have a regular set of characters or story lines, and they’re usu-
ally single-paneled. Each new cartoon is a brand new gag or visual punch line 
delivered in a single frame or box.
Despite not having regular characters, gag cartoons do have advantages over 
comic strips. One main advantage is that they’re marketable to publications 
and Web sites that want a lighthearted, joke-of-the-day feature that a strip 
with characters may not fulfill. Gag cartoons tend to be more generic and 
better suited for these markets. One of the most well-known gag cartoons, 
The Far Side, set the bar high for the genre, and the next-generation succes-
sor to Far Side creator Gary Larson has yet to surface, so get busy, before 
someone else beats you to it!

Getting Started with Drawing
To begin drawing your cartoons, you need decent quality supplies and a des-
ignated workspace. Chapter 3 goes into the art of setting up an office, cubicle, 
or corner for your art and which supplies you need.
 
Before you go to the store and spend any money on supplies, keep in mind 
that although expensive drawing tools are great, they won’t help you at all if 
you don’t have a little talent and a strong commitment to practice. Your best 
bet is to try different drawing supplies to see what works best for you. And 
whatever supplies you end up getting, just be sure to draw, draw, draw!
The comic strip’s close cousin: Comic books
As the other cartooning genres face the chal-
lenges of a shrinking and evolving newsprint 
industry, one cartooning genre closely related 
to comic strips is becoming so big, so fast that it 
dominates not only the cartoonist business but 
the whole entertainment industry as well. Comic 
books have exploded in popularity in the last 
decade, and you have to look no further than 
the top movies in the last few years as proof.
The following is a list of movies based on comic 
books or graphic novels, along with each film’s 
worldwide box office sales numbers as of 2009:
You can see by the numbers that these movies 
grossed more than $8 billion. That kind of financial 
success guarantees that Hollywood will make 
many more movies based on comic books in the 
future.
The comic book/graphic novel industry contin-
ues to thrive. If you have the skills necessary 
to enter this popular market, go for it — it’s a 
worthwhile and potentially lucrative market to 
consider. Although comic books merit an entire 
book of their own, I focus this book more on 
cartooning and comic strips. But even if you’re 
more interested in creating comic books, you 
can still use many of the core pieces of advice 
that I offer about character development, 
humor, background, lettering, and so on.

Drawing a basic character’s head
Your character’s head is the focal point for the reader, so you need to under-
stand a few simple basics in the construction and design of the cartoon noggin:
 
✓ Start at the top with the head shape: Begin with a simple shape, usually 
an oval or small circle. In cartooning, almost every detail is exaggerated, 
particularly when drawing from the neck up. In real life the human head 
is disproportionally larger in kids than adults and gets smaller in propor-
tion to our bodies as we grow. In Chapter 6, I spell out the steps neces-
sary for the basics when drawing your character’s head, whether you’re 
drawing a child or a senior citizen.
 
✓ Fill in facial features and expressions: The face is the epicenter of 
all expression, and cartooning is all about exaggerating expressions 
for effect and drama. In Chapter 6, I show you numerous examples of 
expressions and their relationship to the different facial features. In 
addition, I explore the options you have regarding the size, shape, and 
position of the facial features, as well as the different types associated 
with male and female characters.
Sketching a character’s body
Designing a cartoon character’s body is always a challenge, and in many 
ways it’s not unlike building or designing anything else. You have many dif-
ferent parts, and as a designer you’re in charge of how they fit together to 
Reminiscing over the history of cartoons
Cartooning is far from a new art form. Cartoons 
go back a lot earlier than Charlie Brown, or even 
the earliest cartoon newspaper strips.
The word cartoon comes from the Italian word 
cartone, which means “large paper.” The earli-
est cartoons can be traced back to some very 
large canvases — prehistoric cave drawings 
discovered in the late 19th century. These 
images were painted on the side of a cave and 
reflected the daily life of early humans.
Centuries after people drew all over their cave 
walls to tell a story, cartoon-style drawing 
continued to evolve, and by the early 1300s, 
Egyptians were creating large murals with a 
series of images that told a story. These images 
were simple and easy for the observer to com-
prehend. This form of communication proved to 
be very popular and has continued in one form 
or another up to the present day.
However, it was the 20th century and the inven-
tion of the modern newspaper that brought most 
forms of modern cartooning into existence. 
Although newspapers today are struggling, 
the art of cartooning isn’t about to die with the 
death of newsprint; like the news media, car-
toonists have found a new outlet for their work 
on the Internet.

achieve the best design result. Cartoon characters can be created in an assort-
ment of different sizes and shapes. In Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10, I discuss the 
basics of character body types and overall construction and the options you 
have regarding male, female, and creature shapes and sizes.
Honing your skills
To get better at anything, especially a physical skill like drawing, you need to 
practice. And practice. And practice some more. Consider these basics when 
honing your skills:
 
✓ When first starting out, it doesn’t matter what you draw — just draw 
something. After you have the drawing basics down, you can concen-
trate on your content.
 
✓ Persistence is the key, and you’ll get better over time. Practice makes 
perfect.
 
✓ Copying the art of other cartoonists when you’re young and learning 
to draw is okay as long as you never claim it as your own. Make sure 
you develop your own style and ideas if you want to be a professional.
 
✓ Try and create something fresh while still being marketable. Your mind 
works in a way different from any other human being’s. Take advantage 
of your unique perspective on the world to find something different, but 
not so far out there that it’s unmarketable except to the very odd.
 
✓ Don’t be afraid to ask others for advice, especially if they’re cartoonists 
themselves. And remember, your mom isn’t the best person to critically 
judge your work, although she’s great for your ego.

specifics on drawing everything from parents and kids to the family pet and 
the family car.
Peering into the Future of Cartoons
For many years the syndicate model has been the primary way cartoons have 
been marketed. With this model, syndicates sell comic strips to newspapers 
to build readership for their features. However, this business model is chang-
ing, and quickly. This section takes a closer look at how things are changing 
and what the future holds.

13
 Chapter 1: The Skinny on Cartoons and Comics
Understanding the changes
Newspapers are going through an evolutionary period, and the end result 
may not be encouraging for newsprint. The Internet has become a more and 
more popular venue for aspiring cartoonists and even veteran cartoonists to 
upload their cartoons.
Two factors have hit newspapers hard in recent years:
 
✓ The economy and its effect on advertising. Advertising is one of the 
largest streams of income for newspapers, and without it they’re forced 
to make big cutbacks, layoffs, and in some cases fold altogether.
 
✓ The generational shift to getting news from the Internet. This has had 
a profound effect on newsprint, and not for the better. Although newspa-
pers have made the shift to the Internet, the operations are more scaled 
down and pale in comparison to the print editions.
One problem with marketing online is that the traditional syndicate model 
doesn’t work on the Internet like it does in newsprint. For example, newspa-
pers cater to and service individual markets, so a syndicate could take the 
same comic feature and sell it to multiple newspapers. This worked because 
the people in Denver weren’t reading the same newspaper that the people in 
New Jersey were reading, so it didn’t matter that the same cartoon content ran 
in each paper. The syndicate could essentially sell the same feature content 
over and over again.
The Internet basically destroys this model. Unlike newspapers, which rep-
resent many markets across the country and throughout the world, the 
Internet by comparison is one big market. Why would a newspaper’s Web 
site pay for content that can seen by the same set of eyes elsewhere just by 
clicking a button? The Internet puts access to almost every newspaper in the 
world right at your fingertips.
The answer to this changing market is exclusivity. One comic feature is put 
in one place and all readers must come to it, instead of the old syndicate way 
of the cartoon going out to readers via their local paper. This model changes 
the dynamic considerably and points to webcomics as an eventual successor 
to traditional comic strips.
What the Web offers that syndicates don’t
Many webcomics are similar to comic strips you read in the newspaper, 
except that they’re only available on the Web. They’re also only available on 
one Web site that the cartoonist creates. If people want to read the webcomic, 
they must go to that site.

14
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
Cartoonists can generate revenue from webcomics in a couple of ways:
 
✓ Advertising: The more people come to read the comic, the more traffic 
the Web site gets and the more likely it is to pick up a small amount of 
revenue from advertising.
 
✓ Merchandise and books sold on the Web site: Many online print-on-
demand (POD) companies cater to Web sites that can offer books for 
sale as well as other merchandise such as T-shirts.
The creator of a webcomic has more control over his feature than a 
traditional cartoonist does, but he also must bear more responsibility. 
Webcomic creators are like small businessmen. They’re responsible for not 
only writing and drawing the comic feature — just like if they partnered 
with a syndicate — but also the Web site design, advertising, marketing, 
and sales of related merchandise. The upside is the webcomic creator 
keeps 100 percent of the revenues instead of giving half to the syndicate.
The Internet has a vast sea of popular webcomics. They’re done by amateurs 
and professionals alike, who take advantage of the ability to publish anything 
on the Internet. The more advanced webcomic creators display their features 
in full color and even use some animation.
The future of cartooning has more to do with the public’s appetite than 
with newsprint. The future of comic strips is in transition. Many of the 
newsprint-based comics may die along with print. As long as the public 
loves to read comics in all their forms, cartooning will live on indefinitely. 
New strips will take their place on the Internet. There’s no indication that 
the public will stop reading or that those who have the cartooning bug will 
stop drawing. The future may seem uncertain on one hand, but on the other 
hand, an exciting new frontier is just waiting to be explored. The Internet is 
a vast, relatively new place where cartoons of all kinds will be born and will 
flourish.

artoons are as old as man. Just take a look at the walls of early cave 
dwellers. Although you don’t find any talking woolly mammoths, you do 
find something intrinsic to all cartooning — simplification. The very heart of 
cartooning is the simplification that allows an image to communicate across 
almost any barrier — race, gender, culture, and beyond. And therein lies the 
power of a cartoon — instant familiarity.
A cartoonist uses this kind of shorthand to achieve an entire spectrum of 
effects — from primitive doodles to detailed comic book art. It’s astounding 
when you think of all the permutations the simple cartoon has spawned. The 
major categories are single-panel cartoons, multipanel comic strips, editorial 
cartoons, humorous illustrations, and comic books. But with subcategories 
such as journal comics, webcomics, clip-art comics, graphic novels, manga, 
and photo comics, it’s clear that cartoons have dug deeply into how we 
communicate.
The world of cartooning is vast, so try to expose yourself to all the possibilities 
by working in all the genres. At the very least, you’ll pick up some tricks in one 
form that you can apply to another. More important, by experimenting with 
different genres, you may find out that you have an aptitude for a category that 
you hadn’t originally considered.

Getting Funny with the 
Standard: Comic Strips
Comic strips are a true American art form. The format is a short series of 
panels that communicate a brief story — usually ending with a punch line. 
Most strips have recurring characters, and some feature an underlying story 
line that continues from strip to strip.
The power of the American comic strip is most evident on the Web. In a 
medium whose craft has no limits whatsoever, it’s no coincidence that the 
simple, three-to-four-panel strip dominates the landscape. This section takes 
a closer look at comic strips, including what they are, where they come from, 
and why they’re so popular.
Eyeing a comic strip’s characteristics
The comic strip is the format that readers of newspaper comics are most 
familiar with. Garfield, Dilbert, and Peanuts are all comic strips. Comic strips 
have a deceptively potent ability to develop strong bonds between readers 
and recurring characters, as each new strip over the course of time adds 
layers of meaning to those characters — making them more real than per-
haps any other characters in fiction.
The following are the characteristics of a comic strip that make it easily 
identifiable:
 
✓ Consecutive panels: A comic strip uses consecutive panels to tell a 
short story. Usually, but not always, this story ends in a punch line.
 
✓ Iconography: A comic strip uses all the standard cartooning iconography — 
word balloons, narration boxes, movement lines, and so on — to convey its 
message.
 
✓ Recurring characters: Often, a comic strip’s characters return through-
out the strip’s life. Sometimes the strip has only three or four recurring 
characters, and sometimes — as in the case of Doonesbury — the cast is 
seemingly endless.
Watching the birth of an American art form
From the late 19th century on, newspaper publishers like William Randolph 
Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer understood that comics sell papers. The big 
papers of the day competed fiercely for the best comic strips. These strips 

17
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Cartooning Genres
quickly gained popularity, and newspapers added more as time went on. This 
tradition is what we call the “funny pages,” and you can find it in every large 
newspaper today.
Hearst realized that he could get more bang for his buck by distributing the 
comics he bought for one newspaper to all the newspapers in his chain. He 
started the Newspaper Feature Service in 1913 to do just that. Its success was 
monumental, and it was soon spun off into a separate entity, serving news-
papers beyond the Hearst chain. In 1915, it was renamed the King Features 
Syndicate.
The newspaper syndicates of today operate the very same way: They develop 
distinctive titles to offer to publications on a subscription basis. As a result, 
cartoonists can reap the rewards of having their comics printed in several 
papers across the country (after the syndicate takes its cut, of course). 
Unfortunately, because of the poor health of the American newspaper indus-
try, this has become an increasingly dim prospect. I discuss syndication 
more fully in Chapter 19.
Many comic strips have come and gone over the last century, but a few 
pioneers are worth discussing, because they contributed greatly to the art 
of cartooning as it exists today. The following are two early strips that have 
important lessons you can apply to your own cartooning.
Pogo by Walt Kelly
Pogo, perhaps the first comic strip to employ many of the traits of the best-
written editorial cartoons, was groundbreaking in many ways. Pogo stood out 
from other cartoons of the day for the following reasons:
 
✓ It had masterful art by Kelly. One of the primary reasons for the strip’s 
appeal was the special attention Kelly paid to the art. In comparison to the 
rigidly illustrated panels of other comic strips of the era, Pogo featured a 
loose, expressive line that belied the nonconformity of the strip’s content.
 
✓ It broke accepted conventions. In Pogo, characters might lean against the 
edge of a panel, allowing it to stretch, as if to convey flexibility or move-
ment. Albert the alligator would strike a match against the nearest panel 
edge to light his cigar. These characters were aware of their presence in a 
comic strip, and that added to the strip’s countercultural attitude.
 
✓ It used sharp political satire. Political commentary was virtually unheard 
of in the funny pages, but in Pogo, Kelly presented his stories from the 
viewpoint of his social and political beliefs. Politicians often walked into the 
strip disguised as fellow denizens of the famed Okefenokee Swamp. Perhaps 
most notably, Senator Joseph McCarthy was lampooned as a wildcat named 
Simple J. Malarkey during the height of his red-scare-era influence.
Although Pogo is more than 50 years old, you can discover an awful lot about 
modern cartooning by examining it. Studying Kelly’s work can help you

✓ Be a better caricaturist. With a few deft lines, Kelly was able to graft the 
features of a widely known politician onto the visage of an animal. It’s no 
small feat, but in isolating dominant facial characteristics, he conveyed 
the image gracefully.
 
✓ Become a better artist. Kelly’s attention to texture and perspective gave 
his art a keen realism, even as his expressive lines and playful composi-
tions pushed toward the surreal.
 
✓ Appreciate language more deeply. Sure, schoolteachers cringed, but 
Kelly’s dialogue read more like poetry than prose. His characters’ thick 
Southern accents were laid out phonetically for all the world to see. 
Kelly used the way his characters delivered their lines to convey as 
much expression as the words themselves.
 
✓ Appreciate social satire. Kelly wrote from a distinct political and social 
viewpoint. He used his targets’ own gestures and syntax against them 
as he lampooned them not only as politicians but also as archetypes. 
Rarely heavy-handed, Kelly typically delivered his thoughts quietly — 
he never shouted.
Peanuts by Charles Schulz
The most successful comic strip of all time centers around a boy and his dog. 
It may be called Peanuts, but its overall influence has been anything but! With 
this quiet comic strip, Charles Schulz dramatically changed the landscape of 
American comics. In large part, the Peanuts mystique can be distilled to the 
following:
 
✓ It had simple, accessible art. The entire Peanuts universe is drawn in 
an almost childish manner. As I discuss earlier in the chapter, simple 
images allow people from all walks of life to project their interpretations 
into the drawings. In other words, we see so much in Charlie Brown 
because we put so much there to begin with.
 
✓ It used philosophical humor. Although the drawings were simple, the 
writing was complex. The standard Peanuts gag is far from the slapstick 
frolic you’d expect about a group of children. Instead, the kids deal with 
angst and feelings of insecurity. They brood and they sigh. Schulz’s 
observations were powerful and provocative — making the reader laugh 
and then think.
As a beginning cartoonist, you can take away several lessons from a study of 
Schulz’s work. You can
 
✓ Gain a better understanding of the appeal of creating characters that 
readers can relate to. Schulz used the concept of archetypes in develop-
ing his characters. In other words, Linus represented the young, ques-
tioning philosopher, Charlie Brown was the lonesome loser, Lucy was 
a bully, and Snoopy was an embodiment of wild abandon. By providing 

19
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Cartooning Genres
his characters with such strong personality traits, Schulz made them 
instantly familiar to his readers — all of whom surely had met their 
share of philosophers, losers, bullies, and crazies.
 
✓ Understand the ways you can incorporate your own personality traits 
into your characters. Peanuts wasn’t an instant success. In fact, it took 
years for readers to appreciate the quiet philosophy present in Schulz’s 
humor. But instead of trying to change to please popular tastes, Schulz 
stayed true to his inner voice. In many ways, instead of adapting to his 
readers, Schulz was able to convince readers to adapt to him.
 
✓ Grasp an appreciation of the beauty in minimalist art. Schulz is a won-
derful counterpoint to the lush, textured illustration style of Walt Kelly. 
Schulz’s drawings are geometric and somewhat rough. He uses no per-
spective and little in the way of nuance. It’s a perfect counterpoint to the 
writing’s complexity — almost reassuring the reader that nothing is as 
bad as it may seem. After all, it’s hard to get too worked up about your 
own feelings of inadequacy when the issue is being raised by a kid with a 
round head sporting a single, curly strand of hair.
The Peanuts’ creator in a nutshell
Charles Schulz, the creator of Peanuts, was 
born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1922. Schulz 
loved to read the comics section of the newspa-
per so much that his father gave him the nick-
name Sparky after Sparkplug, the horse in a 
popular comic strip of the day, Barney Google.
Schulz was a gifted child who skipped two 
grades and copied pictures of his favor-
ite cartoon characters from the newspaper. 
Recognizing his passion for drawing, his mother 
enrolled him in a correspondence course from 
an art instruction school. Following a stint in the 
army, Schulz had his new comic strip picked up 
by United Features. He originally called his strip 
Li’l Folks, but the strip was renamed Peanuts 
without Schulz’s knowledge. The first strips 
focused on the iconic characters like Charlie 
Brown, Shermy, Patty, and Snoopy. Within the 
year, Peanuts was appearing in 35 papers, and 
by 1956, that number increased to well over 100.
By the 1960s, Peanuts was appearing in over 
2,300 newspapers, and Schulz was famous 
worldwide. The cartoon branched out into 
TV, and in 1965, the classic Christmas special 
“A Charlie Brown Christmas” premiered to an 
entire generation of young children, followed by 
several others. Many volumes of Schulz’s work 
were published over the years, and many made 
the New York Times Best Seller list.
In 1999, Schulz was diagnosed with cancer and 
subsequently announced that he would retire 
the following year. He died on February 12th, 
2000, the night before his farewell strip was set 
to run in newspapers.
The success of Peanuts has inspired the creation 
of clothes, stationery, toys, games, and other 
merchandise. The financial success of Peanuts 
and the wealth it brought Schulz was unprec-
edented in the comics world. At the peak of his 
earnings, Forbes magazine estimated his annual 
income at $30–$50 million a year. And Schulz 
would have made considerably more if it had not 
been the custom of the day to sell the rights to 
your feature as part of the syndicate contract.

The modern funny papers
Comic strips have been around for over 100 years since the first strip, Mutt 
and Jeff, appeared in print, and readers continue to revel in their favorites. 
Today, the comic strip landscape is populated with such luminaries as 
Garry Trudeau (Doonesbury), Berkeley Breathed (Bloom County), Bill Amend 
(FoxTrot), Lynn Johnston (For Better or For Worse), Bill Watterson (Calvin 
and Hobbes), and Scott Adams (Dilbert).
Cartoonists such as these stand above the rest in their ability to form strong 
bonds with their readers through their work. For Trudeau and Breathed, 
that bond is built on satire and political opinion. For cartoonists like Amend, 
Johnston, and Watterson, the connection comes from their ability to com-
municate a unique view of family life. And Adams lampoons the sometimes 
absurd inner workings of the modern workplace, which many readers can 
relate to.
The next sections take a closer look at the work of Watterson and Adams.
Bill Watterson’s Calvin and Hobbes
Calvin and Hobbes, by cartoonist Bill Watterson, was a comic strip about a 
young boy and the stuffed tiger that came to life in the boy’s imagination. 
Although there had been many previous strips about kids and family, Calvin 
and Hobbes was fundamentally different:
 
✓ Its art expressed as much as the writing. Watterson was an expert 
draftsman, capturing the frenetic energy of 6-year-old Calvin in his lines. 
His graceful touch with watercolors made its way into the Sunday fea-
tures, and they were beautifully and colorfully rendered, harking back to 
strips of another era. Watterson combined attention to illustrative detail 
with an appealing brush quality and fun character design.
 
✓ Its emphasis was on a child’s imagination. Watterson presented most 
of the strip from the viewpoint of Calvin’s overactive imagination. When 
Calvin was alone, his stuffed tiger Hobbes sprang to life as a rambunc-
tious — if not more thoughtful — playmate. In school, his teacher was 
often seen as a hideous monster whom Calvin — sometimes in the 
persona of Spaceman Spiff — was constantly trying to thwart. In a clear 
homage to Winsor McCay’s Little Nemo in Slumberland, daydreams and 
reality often collided — with hysterical results.
 
✓ It presented a decidedly postmodern view of family. Calvin’s dad often 
remarked that, if it were up to him, they would have had a puppy instead 
of a child! This strip didn’t present the shiny, happy, Family Circus 
family; rather, it showed a frustrated father, an overworked mother, and 
a hyperactive kid. In the heyday of the strip’s run — late 80s/early 90s — 
many parents could relate.

21
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Cartooning Genres
Studying the work of Watterson can help you
 
✓ Appreciate how pushing the limits of your creative imagination can 
benefit you as an artist. In Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson accepted the 
challenge of delivering the frantic imaginings of a 6-year-old boy seven 
days a week. To stay true to his character, he couldn’t rely on repetitive 
gags. Even when he returned to certain themes (Spaceman Spiff, Calvin 
as a dinosaur, Calvinball, and so on), Watterson avoided retreading old 
ground — challenging himself instead to push the ideas further.
 
✓ Build confidence in your own vision as an artist. Watterson was against 
any type of licensing or merchandizing of Calvin and Hobbes. He also 
fought for — and won — the right to stop his Sunday comic from being 
forced to follow a decades-old format that allowed newspaper editors to 
resize Sunday funnies several different ways. Despite the fact that these 
decisions made him unpopular with executives at newspapers and syndi-
cates alike, his strip was wildly successful — critically and financially.
 
✓ Appreciate the power of a simple concept executed well. Every bud-
ding cartoonist grapples with a new comic strip with: “Has this already 
been done?” Take a lesson from Watterson. Calvin and Hobbes was not a 
new concept. It had been done in popular culture dozens of times, from 
Winnie the Pooh to Little Nemo in Slumberland. But Watterson knew that 
it’s not the idea; it’s the delivery that truly makes a comic great. He took 
an old concept and brought to it something new and original.
Scott Adams and Dilbert
Scott Adams’s comic strip Dilbert originally revolved around Dilbert and his 
dog Dogbert in their home. However, Adams moved the primary location of 
most of the action to Dilbert’s workplace at a large technology company. It 
was only after this shift that the strip began to take off and gain a much larger 
readership.
The success of Dilbert comes from some of the following:
 
✓ It portrays corporate culture as a world filled with red tape and 
bureaucracy, lives consumed with office politics, and a place where 
employees’ skills and efforts are ignored and busywork is rewarded. 
Many American employees can relate to this!
 
✓ It accentuates the absurdity of the cubicle and corporate workplace. 
Much of the humor and insightfulness of the strip comes from the 
reader seeing characters making absurd, nonsensical decisions that are 
the result of directives given by misguided managers.

22
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
Studying the work of Scott Adams helps you
 
✓ Understand the priority and importance of strong writing over art. No 
one can accuse Adams of being a brilliant artist, but no one can deny 
that he’s a tremendously skillful humor writer. His fantastic abilities to 
write solid, consistent humor keep his readers returning, not his crude 
artistic style.
 
✓ Build the confidence to write what you know. Before becoming a 
cartoonist, Adams worked at Pacific Bell, occupying a cubicle that’s all-
too-familiar to the Dilbert landscape. His writing was always good, but 
it didn’t truly resonate with readers until he started sharing his experi-
ences as a white-collar office-dweller. After he started writing from per-
sonal history, his work reached an entirely different level.
 
✓ Appreciate the workings of the cartoonist/businessperson. Adams is a 
perfect antithesis to Bill Watterson. Where Watterson focused on the art 
of comics, Adams focused on comics as a business. The licensing and 
merchandizing of Dilbert has been breathtaking — from microwave bur-
ritos to a TV sitcom. Adams has been able to leverage his success as a 
cartoonist into countless lucrative opportunities for himself — without 
sacrificing the quality of his daily comic.
Grasping why comics are still popular
In this day of digital everything, hand-drawn (okay, possibly digitally 
enhanced!) cartoons are still the first thing that many people turn to when 
they open the daily news. So what makes comic strips so popular? Their lon-
gevity is based on the following reasons:
 
✓ Comic strips don’t change. Unlike live-action TV shows, where the char-
acters age and the kids grow up, comic strip characters can stay frozen 
in time (although some cartoonists do “age” their characters). Cartoon 
characters may stay the same, but the material is always new. You see 
this not only in comic strips but also in popular animated TV shows 
like The Simpsons, which is now more than 20 years old, making it the 
longest-running scripted comedy show in history.
 
✓ People don’t change. Although society has changed and communication 
methods have changed, people still find family, pets, and work amusing — 
at least part of the time. People relate to the familiar, and most cartoons 
are based on familiar situations.
 
✓ Comic strips have something for everyone. Whether you’re liberal or 
conservative, a family person or a single guy, an office drone or a con-
struction worker, you can find a cartoon to appeal to your tastes.

Making Readers Think: 
Editorial Cartoons
The primary intent of an editorial cartoon is to present an opinion. But more 
than simply present an opinion, an editorial cartoonist uses strong satire, 
caricature, and parody to drive home her point as strongly as possible. In 
short, editorial cartooning isn’t a game for the weak-willed, middle-of-the-
road thinker. This kind of cartooning takes sides and asks no forgiveness. 
Needless to say, America has a long, rich tradition of editorial cartooning.
The next sections look at the characteristics of editorial cartooning and how 
they’ve evolved over the last two centuries in the United States.
Eyeing an editorial cartoon’s traits
The editorial cartoon is a mainstay of a newspaper’s opinion pages. The 
reason for this is simple: People respond strongly to an editorial cartoon’s 
ability to present a complex argument using an image and a few short sen-
tences. In a way, this short, punchy delivery defines the art form itself.
Unlike comic strips, editorial cartoons don’t have recurring characters 
(unless you count politicians). Here are some other characteristics of edito-
rial cartoons:
Some still-popular cartoons are more than 50 years old, although most of 
their characters haven’t aged a day over that time period. Here are a few 
examples of long-running comic strips, along with the year that they began:

24
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
 
✓ They’re usually one-panel comics. Most editorial cartoons consist of a 
single panel presenting a solitary scene. A few practitioners (Tom Toles 
of The Washington Post, most notably) choose to divide the space into 
comic-strip-style panels, but overwhelmingly, an editorial cartoon relies 
on a single illustration of a key moment or scene.
 
✓ They make strong use of visual metaphor. Editorial cartoonists don’t 
say it, they show it. If a politician is accused of stealing money from a 
government fund, you can bet that a cartoonist will draw him with his 
hand in the proverbial cookie jar. Because editorial cartoonists convey 
so much information visually, their words can be short and direct. The 
combination of the two can pack a wallop.
 
✓ They draw from a long history of icons. Editorial cartoonists can 
deliver parts of their message by using an entire repository of icons that 
have been developed over decades of cartooning. Donkeys represent 
Democrats, and elephants are Republicans. The United States can be rep-
resented by Uncle Sam, the Statue of Liberty, or an eagle — depending 
on which is most appropriate. Sometimes cartoonists incorporate these 
icons into the visual metaphor to make the message even stronger.
 
✓ They use caricature to ridicule their targets. Editorial cartoonists aren’t 
polite. If a subject has somewhat large ears, their cartoon image may 
closely resemble Dumbo. Because their primary targets are people in 
authoritative positions, the use of harsh caricature may have the useful 
psychological benefit of making the subjects seem less powerful. Of 
course, psychology aside, such imagery also makes for prime comedy.
 
✓ They often rely heavily on satire to make their point. One good and 
well-known example of satire in a political cartoon is a cartoon acknowl-
edged to be the first political cartoon in America, written by Ben Franklin. 
His “Join or Die,” which depicts a snake whose severed parts represent 
the American colonies, is based on a common superstition of the day 
that stated that a dead snake would come back to life if the pieces were 
placed next to one another. Franklin’s main editorial point was that the 
new American colonies would always be one in spirit, despite attempts 
by the British to disrupt and break up the colonies’ quest for indepen-
dence as a new country. Franklin’s snake became an iconic image that 
ended up being used on the “Don’t Tread on Me” battle flag.
Editorial cartooning: An 
American tradition
The mid-to-late 20th century ushered in a new school of political cartooning. 
This approach moved away from the single panel/grease pencil style that had 
been in vogue for nearly 50 years and gave it more of a modern look and feel.

25
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Cartooning Genres
The new method was heavily influenced by the styles and tone of the British 
tradition of cartooning and focused more on vicious caricature, subtle humor, 
and sly wit while moving away from the iconic and sometimes patriotic or sen-
timental images seen in political cartoons in the earlier part of the century.
Two cartoonists were at the forefront of this new wave. They made a sig-
nificant impact on editorial cartooning and strongly influenced what it has 
become today. They are as follows:
 
✓ Pat Oliphant: Oliphant played an enormous role in reshaping the way edi-
torial cartoons look and feel today. His approach was new and fresh, and 
the young cartoonists of the day immediately began to emulate his brushy 
line quality. Oliphant’s cartoons were more derivative of the Mad maga-
zine school of satire than the more serious cartoons that appeared in the 
1950s and before. Check out the nearby sidebar for more on Oliphant.
 
 His style, like that found on the pages of Mad, was appealing to younger 
cartoonists just starting out, and it spurred a whole generation of 
Oliphant “clones.” Aspiring editorial cartoonists who follow Oliphant’s 
work can
 
• Understand great political caricature. Oliphant’s caricature is gro-
tesque to the point of being almost cruel. But that’s exactly what a 
caricature is supposed to be. Oliphant knows how to exploit domi-
nant physical characteristics to engender an emotional response in 
the reader.
 
• See how the cartoon’s art can communicate to the reader. The 
overwhelming strength of Oliphant’s work lies in its imagery. 
More often than not, he lets the tone, content, and implication of 
his illustrations carry his meaning, allowing the words to simply 
underscore the point. It’s not the “Follow me” punch line deliv-
ered as Oliphant’s childlike George W. Bush (sporting a 24-gallon 
cowboy hat) proudly marches off the edge of a cliff; it’s the head-
less, hulking juggernaut stomping dutifully in tow, representing 
Bush’s supporters, that carries Oliphant’s true message.
 
• Feel the ferocity of political and social satire. Oliphant’s work is 
indicative of the finest traditions of editorial cartooning — vicious 
satire. Even-handed reasoning is best left to columnists and essay-
ists who have time to weigh both sides of an issue. An editorial 
cartoonist like Oliphant comes down on one side — hard — and 
delivers his points with the power of a sledgehammer.
 
✓ Jeff MacNelly: MacNelly was a three-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, 
best known for his long-running comic strip Shoe. Aspiring editorial 
cartoonists who follow MacNelly’s work can
 
• Understand great character style. MacNelly’s illustrations are 
replete with detail. Each person in the scene, including any inno-
cent bystanders and onlookers, is a fully realized being with 

26
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
personality and character. MacNelly’s detailed character design 
speaks volumes about the people he draws — from pencil-necked 
geeks to denim-clad good-ol’-boys.
 
• See how whimsical art can be fun and appealing to the reader. 
Like his contemporary Pat Oliphant, MacNelly created imagery that 
evokes as much meaning as the words used in the cartoon. But 
where Oliphant favored heavy, dark, brooding scenes, MacNelly’s 
work emphasized the expressiveness of the brush strokes he used 
to build the scenes. The result is an almost buoyant lift to his 
illustrations — an emotion often belied by the cutting satire of 
the cartoon.
 
• Grasp the subtle aspects of political and social satire. MacNelly 
was more than capable of brutal satire, but often he favored a 
more subtle approach, allowing understatement to carry the day. 
For example, in a scene depicting a meeting of the “Evil Empires,” 
representatives of Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and China occupy 
a gigantic table with dozens of empty chairs. “Move that we dis-
pense with the calling of the roll,” deadpans the Chinese diplomat.
The influence of Oliphant and MacNelly has been so great that it has spurred 
critics to name this style the “Olinelly” style and to label those cartoonists 
who’ve followed them as “Olinelly clones.” Regardless, their work represents 
a vital, legitimate form of social commentary with a long, rich tradition that 
continues to thrive.
Sophisticated Humor: Gag Cartoons
Cartoons can be sophisticated; just peek at The New Yorker and other maga-
zines known for their urbane, highbrow humor. Although not as common as 
down-home, family-humor cartoons, comics that run in glossy magazines are 
often subtle and thought-provoking. This kind of cartoon, often called a gag 
cartoon, favors a quick punch line and a brief scene — rather than the multi-
panel, build-to-punch-line approach of a comic strip.
Defining gag cartoon traits
While comic strips and editorial cartoons rule the world of newspapers, gag 
cartoons dominate the landscape of magazines. They can be inserted on a 
page and stand on their own strengths, requiring no explanation or back 
story. For this reason, they’re perfect for monthly publications such as The 
New Yorker and Cosmopolitan, which use gags to enliven pages and under-
score the tone of the publication without expecting readers to remember 
installments of the cartoons delivered 30 days prior.

27
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Cartooning Genres
Gag cartoons are identified by the following:
 
✓ Single panel images: Gag cartoons aren’t divided into panels; rather, 
they rely on a single illustration to drive home the punch line.
 
✓ Captions: Unlike comic strips, in which the text is carried in word bal-
loons inside the panels, the pervading practice in gag cartoons is to 
present the text in a caption below the panel.
 
✓ Quick, concise humor: The content of a gag cartoon is always humor-
ous. Moreover, they cut directly to the punch line, with little or no time 
spent on building tension. More often than not, the caption is a single 
sentence that, along with the image, contains all the context needed to 
deliver the humor. The result is a lightning-fast joke — as the term “gag” 
implies.
 
✓ Stand-alone stories: Gag cartoons have no recurring characters and 
no previous story lines. They’re completely independent vignettes that 
don’t rely on previous episodes for readers to understand them. For this 
reason, gag cartoons have tremendous “refrigerator appeal” — they’re 
the kinds of comics you’re most likely to find affixed to your neighbor’s 
fridge or a coworker’s cubicle.
Identifying two influential gaggers
Gag cartoonists are among the most talented cartoonists in the spectrum of 
the art. They must deliver the humor with a single image and one sentence — 
maybe two. This is a staggering feat to achieve, but not surprisingly, gag car-
toonists who can hit the mark with consistency are among the best-loved 
comic creators in American pop culture.
 
✓ Charles Addams: Charles Addams was among the very finest of the pan-
theon of gag cartoonists whose work was featured in The New Yorker. 
His beautifully rendered panels and wicked sense of humor made his 
work some of the most pervasive humor of the 1950s. The TV sitcom 
The Addams Family was based on a series of his gag comics that por-
trayed a family of well-meaning, if not twisted, ghouls. Addams’s work 
holds plenty of lessons for a novice gag cartoonist:
 
• Use tone to carry a message. Addams’s images were rendered in 
an ink-wash style — painted in tones of grey created by diluting 
ink with different amounts of water. Under his brush, he used this 
method to create moody and evocative scenes. When the grisly 
family prepares to dump hot oil on a gathering of holiday carolers 
from the rooftop of their aging mansion, the ominous drawing of 
the building itself — with its classic haunted-house features — sets 
a perfect tone for the inevitable outcome.

28
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
 
• Learn comedy patterns. Obviously, no formula exists for writing 
good humor, but comedy does tend to follow certain patterns. One 
of these patterns is something bizarre carried out with the air of 
normalcy.
 
• Appreciate the power of composition. Many of Addams’s stron-
gest cartoons are scenes in which the punch line is carried by the 
image rather than the text. To accomplish this, you have to learn 
how a reader’s eyes follow the composition of a scene. The trick is 
to delay the reader from seeing the crucial bit of visual evidence 
until the last moment. Done right, the effects are sublime, such 
as the Addams cartoon featuring a crowded theater of guffawing 
patrons — among whom is hidden a Mona Lisa, her half-smile a 
perfect foil to the surrounding hysteria.
 
✓ Gary Larson: No gag cartoonist has come to define the genre the way 
Gary Larson has (see the sidebar, “Going far out and out on top” in this 
chapter). Although he hung up his pens way back in 1995, no subse-
quent newspaper gagger who has achieved a degree of quality in her 
work has been able to avoid the derisive tag of “Larson wannabe.” Ten 
years after his final, syndicated panel, Larson’s reprints still grace cal-
endars, coffee mugs, and books. Larson’s approach to gag cartooning is 
indicative of much of the best to be found in the genre:
 
• Write from your strength. From zoology to chemistry, Larson has 
an overriding love of and fascination for science. And he brought 
that passion to his work in a way that laypeople could enjoy, just 
for the sheer silliness of it.
 
• Great writing can support simplistic art. Larson falls squarely 
into the category of the cartoonist whose art is secondary to his 
humor. Although his drawings aren’t crude — like fellow gagger 
James Thurber — they certainly lack the detailed opulence of 
Addams. Regardless, his minimalist imagery is supported fully by a 
tremendous wit.
 
• When in doubt, get weirder. Larson’s work is defined by a daring 
weirdness. He rarely approaches standard topics like family life or 
office politics except through the lens of a family of cobras or an 
office inhabited by sheep and wolves. Many of the best gag cartoon-
ists take an idea and push it past odd, headlong into bizarre, and 
that hyperbole is what provides the energy behind the comedy.
New Yorker cartoons
Although it often focuses on the cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker 
magazine, which began life in the 1920s, has a wide audience outside of New 
York. The magazine has a long, rich tradition of publishing commentary, 
criticism, essays, fiction, satire, and poetry. But it’s perhaps most famous 
for its signature cartoons.

29
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Cartooning Genres
The magazine’s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in 
American humor, including Charles Addams, George Booth, Richard Decker, 
Ed Koren, George Price, Charles Saxon, William Steig, Saul Steinberg, James 
Thurber, and Gahan Wilson, just to name a few.
 
The New Yorker employs its own cartoon editor who oversees the selection of 
cartoons in each individual issue. Perhaps the first notable cartoon editor was 
Lee Lorenz, himself a cartoonist and contributor going back to 1956. Lorenz 
remained in the cartoon editor position until his retirement in 1998, after which 
it was assumed by Robert Mankoff, who continues as the cartoon editor today.
New Yorker-style cartoons are recognizable for the following characteristics:
 
✓ They focus more on the sophisticated nature of the subtle punch line 
and less on slapstick. Instead of Larsonesque hyperbole, New Yorker 
cartoons are defined by a much more cerebral, quieter wit. Often, the 
punch lines aren’t built around humorous concepts so much as on the 
nuances of words and attitudes. In a Thurber classic, a giant seal is 
perched above the headboard of a couple’s bed. The wife growls, “All 
right, have it your way — you heard a seal bark.”
 
✓ They generally eschew an overly cartoony style of art. The drawing 
style can range from minimalist line art to sophisticated and elaborate 
charcoal pencil drawings depicting Gothic architecture.
Going far out and out on top
Gary Larson grew up in the Seattle, Washington 
area. While he was a young man working in a 
music store he discovered he had surplus time 
to draw and doodle. He decided to try his hand 
at cartooning and drew several cartoons, sub-
mitting them to a Seattle-based magazine. He 
followed by contributing to a small local Seattle 
paper, and later to the Seattle Times. The paper 
liked his work and began publishing it on a 
weekly basis under the title Nature’s Way.
In an effort to make some extra money from 
cartooning, Larson pitched his work to the San 
Francisco Chronicle, which bought the strip and 
sponsored it for syndication through its own 
Chronicle Features syndicate. The syndicate 
also suggested he change the name to The Far 
Side.
The Far Side ran for 15 years, ending with 
the announcement of Larson’s retirement on 
January 1, 1995. Larson chose to end the car-
toon because he didn’t want to fall into predict-
ability. Larson went out on top, and as of 1995, 
The Far Side was carried by nearly 2,000 daily 
newspapers, had been collected into 22 books, 
and was reproduced extensively on greeting 
cards, which continue to be popular today. In 
addition, two animated specials were produced 
for TV. Most recently, Larson published a 2009 
calendar and is donating all his author royalties 
to conservational organizations.

Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
Getting a cartoon printed in The New Yorker is an especially prestigious 
honor for many cartoonists, and the competition is fierce. In addition to its 
regular magazine, The New Yorker has published numerous cartooning collec-
tions over the years, and each of these compilations has been ranked at the 
top of the New York Times Best Seller list.
The influence of Mad magazine
Perhaps no other single magazine has had 
so much influence on cartoonists (as well as 
comedy writers, stand-up comics, animators, 
gag writers, and the criminally insane) as Mad 
magazine. Mad first appeared on newsstands 
in October 1952. The first issue spoofed comics 
by genre: It featured mock stories about crime 
and horror. The stories poked fun at the stan-
dards of traditional comics. The artwork, by a 
variety of early Mad regulars, established the 
wild, satirical comic style that would dominate 
Mad; visual sight gags and wacky reinterpreta-
tions of conventional mainstream values played 
out on every page. 
The magazine originally went by the title of 
Tales Calculated to Drive You Mad. It wasn’t 
until after issue # 17 that those first five words 
would be dropped and the magazine would 
from there on out be known only as Mad. The 
first several issues didn’t sell particularly well. 
However, issue #4 in the spring of 1953 featured 
Mad’s first parody of a specific character, 
“Superduperman!” Teenagers loved the witty 
parody, and magazine sales started to pick up 
as Mad gained a loyal audience. 
This issue also marked the first time Mad ran 
into legal problems over its parodies and off-
the-wall humor. After Mad poked fun at DC 
Comics premiere superhero Superman, DC 
Comics threatened to sue. Mad argued that 
parody was protected by the U.S. Constitution. 
The case never came to court because DC 
never bothered to push the matter. As a result, 
Mad subsequently made its reputation by 
zeroing in on other iconic cartoon characters, 
celebrities, advertisers, name brands, and the 
movie business. 
What made Mad a hit and a symbol of its time? 
All the following, plus more:
 ✓ Mad connected with teenagers, in particu-
lar. The postwar culture of the 1950s tended 
to take itself very seriously, and Mad began 
skewering this father-knows-best world, in 
which citizens had become consumers and 
advertising dictated the public’s taste. 
 ✓ Mad hired incredibly talented people. The 
creative and inventive team of writers and 
cartoonists turned out high quality, innova-
tive work. 
Over the years Mad’s layout and look have been 
updated. Over time the once-subversive maga-
zine became an institution and, in a less hege-
monic and more Internet-obsessed culture, it 
seemed less culturally significant. Most of the 
“original gang of idiots” (as the original legend-
ary staff called themselves) are no longer with 
the magazine. In their place are a new, younger 
batch of cartoonists. Most people agree that 
the original lineup would be hard to duplicate.
Citing a challenging economy and falling sales, 
Mad’s parent company announced in the begin-
ning of 2009 that Mad would cease its monthly 
publication schedule and now only appear 
quarterly. Nevertheless, Mad has played a cru-
cial role in influencing an entire generation of 
young cartoonists working today. Without its 
contributions it’s safe to say that many of the 
great comic features we see today may never 
have been.

 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Cartooning Genres
Budding cartoonists can benefit from studying the work of New Yorker 
cartoonists by
 
✓ Understanding how intelligent writing can be funny, too. In some 
ways, hyperbole can become a crutch to a novice humorist. New Yorker 
cartoons show how a slight nuance — an appreciation for the subtle 
connotations of words and phrases — can lead to very satisfying writ-
ing. In one Gahan Wilson scene, a man comes home to see a “Happy 
Birthday” banner hanging above a table set for a party. His wife, seated, 
reading a newspaper, drones, “This was supposed to be a surprise party 
for you, but nobody showed up.”
 
✓ Seeing how the tone of the art can prepare the reader. New Yorker car-
toons are almost singularly identified by their light, airy images and graceful 
economy of line. This underscores the sophisticated tone of the comics — 
almost preparing the reader for a quiet quip rather than a powerful punch.
 
✓ Recognizing the importance of observational humor. So much of the 
New Yorker repertoire is based on observations of everyday life. This 
kind of humor is driven almost entirely by the excitement of the reader 
being presented something she commonly experiences that’s contex-
tualized in a unique way. For example, in a David Sipress vignette, as a 
couple greets another couple farther down the sidewalk, the panicked 
husband whispers to his wife: “Quick! Remind me — are they handshak-
ers, huggers, single kissers, or kissers on both cheeks?”
Web Cartooning
As the Internet continues to define the delivery of news and entertainment, it’s 
only fitting that a new breed of cartoonists has sprung up to take advantage 
of this exciting time. The Web allows cartoonists to self-publish their work to 
a worldwide audience with extremely meager means. On the Internet, a young 
cartoonist doesn’t answer to an editor, nor does she wait for the approval of a 
syndicate. If the work is good enough, it finds its own success on the Web.
Webcomics are defined more by their medium — and the effect that medium 
has on their work — than by the format or theme of the cartoons. Webcomics 
can take the form of any of the previously mentioned genres of cartooning — 
strips, gags, or editorials — and push beyond with such things as interactive 
features and animations.
Some of the significant characteristics of Web cartoonists include
 
✓ They build a community. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of a 
webcomic is the strong bonds between the creator and the readers. In 
addition to being able to e-mail their reaction directly to cartoonists, read-
ers of webcomics can become intimately involved in the world created 
by the cartoonist through blogs, message boards, and social networking 

32
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
media. As a result, readers not only form relationships with cartoonist but 
also build a community with the other readers of that comic.
 
✓ They make money by giving their work away for free. As strange as it 
sounds, that’s the driving force behind the webcomics business model. 
Most Web cartoonists offer the entire archive of their work on their site, 
free for anyone to peruse. Sites rarely, if ever, have subscription fees. 
Web cartoonists are able to generate an income through selling adver-
tising on their sites and selling books and other licensed merchandise 
based on their work.
 
✓ They’re largely do-it-yourselfers. Because webcomics don’t involve syn-
dicates or publishers — and because advances such as print-on-demand 
publishing have allowed the beginner to self-publish books without a 
huge outlay of money — Web cartoonists don’t need a large corporation 
to back their work. As a result, any money that cartoonists make can be 
kept in its entirety, without requiring a split between, say, syndicate and 
creator. With this expanded profit margin, Web cartoonists can make 
much more money by selling much less merchandise and advertising.
 
✓ They may appeal to a niche. Because Web cartoonists can make more 
money by selling less, it’s more possible for them to cast a smaller net 
in terms of their subject matter. In other words, although a comic strip 
about librarians written for librarians would never appeal to a newspa-
per syndicate, Unshelved by Bill Barnes and Gene Ambaum has found 
tremendous (and lucrative) success on the Web.
Two examples of successful webcomics include
 
✓ PvP: PvP (www.pvponline.com) is one of the oldest webcomics still in 
production, and certainly one of the more successful. Cartoonist Scott 
Kurtz has built it from a generic webcomic about video games into a five-
day-a-week office comedy that focuses on a small cast of beloved char-
acters. His work on PvP (an abbreviation for the video game term player 
versus player) has earned him significant crossover success in the world 
of print comics. Image Comics publishes a monthly PvP comic book, and 
Kurtz has earned the Will Eisner Award, the highest honor given in the 
comic book industry. Studying Kurtz’s PvP can shed light on the concept 
of webcomics.
 
✓ Penny Arcade: Penny Arcade (www.penny-arcade.com) is by far 
the most successful webcomic on the Internet. Writer Jerry Holkins 
and artist Mike Krahulik collaborate on a three-day-a-week comic that 
focuses on the video game industry. As with the vast majority of web-
comics, their site and access to their entire archive (it dates back to 
1998, which is akin to the early Jurassic period in Internet years) is 
free. Despite this unorthodox business model, Penny Arcade generates 
millions of dollars in annual revenue; operates a charity, Child’s Play, 
to fund worldwide toy drives for children’s hospitals; and organizes 
PAX, an annual convention for the video game industry. Penny Arcade 
presents a chance to understand webcomics more deeply.

Getting Your Workspace 
Ready to Go
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up your drawing area
▶ Choosing a worktable
▶ Purchasing the necessary supplies
▶ Deciding on a computer and other equipment
▶ Getting the right software
I
n order to be able to draw cartoons on a regular basis, you need a little 
area devoted to your craft. Although drawing cartoons at the kitchen table 
is perfectly okay, having a dedicated area set up for drawing is not only more 
efficient — it’s also more fun! The right lighting, a well-appointed drawing 
table, a comfortable chair, and the proper tools and supplies — which today 
include a good computer and artist-oriented software — make cartooning 
easier and the results more professional. This chapter helps you set up your 
workspace and helps you decide which tools to buy to make your cartooning 
simpler and more enjoyable.
Searching for a Workspace
Setting up an organized and well-equipped workspace is an important task for 
every artist. Locating the right workspace can go a long way toward increas-
ing your efficiency and creative output when it’s time to get down to work. 
But even more important, you want to create a location that’s a fun place to 
spend a lot of time doing what you love to do . . . draw!
So, where do you even begin your search for a workspace? A workspace 
should be a place in your home that allows you to escape the distractions 
and interruptions of daily life so that you can concentrate on getting down to 

34
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
work. This section walks you through the options available to you when set-
ting up a place to get creative, even if you don’t have a lot of space available. 
You don’t have to break the bank when setting up your workspace, either; the 
following sections tell you what you should spend big on, and when skimping 
is okay.
Looking at your options
When creating a designated work space, you’re limited only by the size of 
your house and the amount of empty space you have available. Of course, 
the best workspace is one where you can go in and shut the door. A spare 
bedroom or den makes a great office studio; utilizing these spaces, you’ll 
almost certainly have a way to shut out the outside world and may even have 
your own bathroom! 
If you aren’t fortunate enough to have an unused spare room, a corner of the 
basement or even a garage that doesn’t get used by cars can make a great 
workspace. You may need to do a little remodeling or updating in order to 
make these areas comfortable to work in, like improving the lighting, heating, 
or esthetics of the areas. No one wants to work in a space that’s physically 
depressing! If you’re also a good handyman type, putting in some simple 
creature comforts can give you a place to work at little cost.
Utilizing a small space
If you live in an apartment or dorm and designating a separate space for a 
studio isn’t an option, don’t despair — a workspace can fit into the small-
est of living situations! Setting up a studio in the corner of your bedroom is 
a great solution if you’re short on space. A walk-in closet may make a great 
small studio and may even have its own light fixture and door.
The fact of the matter is, any available corner or wall space in a small apart-
ment can be a good designated place to set up a small art table and file cabi-
net. You’re limited only by your imagination and ingenuity.
Setting Up Your Workspace
After you decide where you want your workspace, you need to set it up so 
that you can begin drawing. However, before you head out to the store, take 
some time and do some planning. Make a list of what you need for your work-
space. Although everyone’s list will be a little different, most artists’ work-
spaces include some of the basic equipment I discuss in this section.

35
 Chapter 3: Getting Your Workspace Ready to Go
Making your workspace ergonomic
When you’re setting up the actual layout and design of your office, think 
ergonomically. No, not economically — although that’s not a bad idea either. 
Ergonomics is the design process that involves arranging the environment 
to fit the individual using it. Ergonomics, also called human engineering, is 
essentially the science of creating an environment that makes work enjoy-
able by reducing stress and strain on your body. An ergonomic environment 
should increase output and decrease frustration.
 
To make your workspace ergonomic, try the following:
 
✓ Place your equipment, art supplies, and drawing area within easy 
reach and access. You don’t want to constantly have to reach, bend, or 
twist to reach your supplies.
 
✓ Buy the right chair. You can buy a chair made specifically for working at 
a desk or drawing table, and if you can afford one, go for it. The money 
spent is a good investment. Make sure you try out several chairs before 
choosing one, because what fits someone else may not fit you comfort-
ably at all. If you can’t afford a well-engineered but expensive chair, make 
sure the chair you’re using is comfortable for long time periods. (Check 
out the “Buying a chair that won’t break your back” section later in this 
chapter for more information.)
 
✓ Check your body position. The way you sit in the chair in relation to 
the angle of the table top and the access to the equipment you use often 
makes a big difference in your overall comfort. If your chair is comfort-
able but it sits at right angles to your workspace, you’re going to end up 
with a sore back and a stiff neck!
 
✓ Sit up at the table. Hunching over your workspace will have your back 
screaming for mercy in no time.
 
✓ Adjust the angle of your table. If you have a table that can be angled, 
adjust it so that you can place your paper on top and work comfort-
ably, but not on so much of an angle that your work constantly slides 
off onto the floor. Obviously, this won’t work if the kitchen table is 
your workspace!
Choosing a practical workspace surface
Selecting the right workspace surface is paramount. This surface is the 
heart and center of all the things you create, even in the digital age. If 
you have space in your home or apartment, the ideal way to go is a table 
devoted specifically to drawing.

36
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
You basically have two types of options when picking a worktable: an art 
table or a professional drafting table (see Figure 3-1). This section takes a 
closer look at these two types and touches on some pros and cons for each 
kind of table.
 
Figure 3-1: 
An art table 
(left) and a 
professional 
drafting 
table (right).
 
 
If you simply don’t have the space in your small living area for an art table, I 
suggest you use a portable drafting top that can be placed on any table top. 
These are available at bigger art supply stores, or you can order one online. If 
you’re handy, you can get creative and build your own. Use a smooth surface 
material that’s strong enough to support your working on it. Cut it down to 
about 2 x 2 feet and place some books behind it to prop it up so that it’s tilted 
at an angle.
Option No. 1: Smaller art table
Art tables tend to be compact, with small surfaces. You can usually find a 
smaller art table at most art supply stores for under $200.
If you’re contemplating purchasing an art table, consider these advantages:
 
✓ Affordability: They tend to be less expensive than professional drafting 
tables.
 
✓ Space saving: Because they tend to be smaller, they work well in the 
corner of a small room.
 
✓ Ability to tilt: They can be tilted to your convenience; some can tilt up 
to 90 degrees, allowing you more flexibility.
Some disadvantages to using an art table include:
 
✓ Small surface area: Their tops are small, which means a restricted work 
area.

37
 Chapter 3: Getting Your Workspace Ready to Go
 
✓ Lack of stability: Their construction can be flimsy, and they can move 
under hard erasing.
 
✓ No storage space: They typically have no drawer for storage.
Option No. 2: Professional drafting table
Professional drafting tables are larger and heavier and used in more commer-
cial applications. The larger drafting tables are available only in higher end 
art supply stores and design supply centers. They range in cost from a few 
hundred dollars up to several thousand dollars.
If you’re considering a professional drafting table, keep the following advan-
tages in mind:
 
✓ Large surface area: Their tops are large, which means a bigger area to 
draw.
 
✓ Stability: They’re sturdily constructed and usually made out of solid oak 
or steel.
 
✓ Storage: They usually have many options for storage, like built-in draw-
ers and/or shelves.
The cons of a professional drafting table include:
 
✓ Expense: They cost more than smaller art tables.
 
✓ Weight: They’re heavy and hard to move around.
 
✓ Bulkiness: They’re large and bulky and usually work best in a desig-
nated room or area.
 
If you’re serious about making cartooning a career or even a serious hobby, 
invest in the best table you can afford. If you want something that will last for 
years to come, I recommend buying a sturdy, commercial-type table. The long-
term benefits will outweigh any initial costs.
Buying a chair that won’t break your back
When you furnish your workspace with a chair, you want to make sure 
you find one that’s comfortable. The good news: Most drafting chairs are 
designed with ergonomics in mind. As you look for different chairs, make 
sure you sit in each and give it a whirl. Try it out and experiment with it. Ask 
yourself how you feel. Are you relaxed? Would you like sitting in this chair for 
long periods of time? 

38
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
If you’re comfortable sitting in the chair despite working for long hours, then 
the chair is probably right for you. However, after sitting for hours don’t forget 
to take a few breaks and stretch out your legs. This may even help your cre-
ativity so that when you come back you’re refreshed and ready to go. 
When shopping for a chair, keep the following characteristics in mind. A good 
work chair
 
✓ Provides ample support for the muscles of the back, the arms, and the 
legs. You’re going to be sitting in the chair sometimes for hours, so it’s 
important that it’s comfortable and doesn’t create any extra fatigue on 
your body. 
 
✓ Avoids restricting pressure points. Restricting pressure points can 
hamper blood circulation and cause cramps or nerve damage. For exam-
ple, avoid a chair that digs into your back or legs, or that has an armrest 
that leaves dents or creases on your arm when you rest on it. 
 
✓ Is well constructed. Look at how sturdy the weld is that holds the seat 
plate to the seat post. In the past, I’ve had chairs that break at the weld 
area and I’ve had to have them re-welded. This is partly because I spend 
a lot of time in the chair in different positions — sitting, leaning back, 
rolling around. The welds crack and I have to fix them — and I’m a 
skinny guy!
 
✓ Is movable. Get a chair with good wheels and one that rotates and spins 
effortlessly so that you can move around and reach other areas of your 
studio without much strain.
Lighting your way
Good lighting is important because you have to be able to see what you’re 
drawing and you don’t want to strain your eyes more than you have to. You 
also don’t want to cast shadows on your drawing. To ensure your work-
space has appropriate lighting to help you see, a good swivel arm lamp that 
attaches to your drafting table is the best way to go. In my workspace, I use 
two adjustable swing arm lamps that you can purchase at any art supply 
store.
 
Bulbs with 60 to 100 watts can provide you with plenty of light to suit your 
needs in your workspace. The best type and least expensive to use is a simple 
incandescent light bulb. Use a lower wattage bulb if your workspace is small 
to avoid too much heat, and stay away from halogen lights, because they get 
especially hot.

39
 Chapter 3: Getting Your Workspace Ready to Go
Organizing your space
Trying to keep your workspace neat and organized is important. Doing so 
is particularly important when drawing cartoons and comics, because you 
don’t want to waste time looking for things when you could be drawing, espe-
cially if you’re under a deadline. You’ll notice I said try, because the papers 
and clutter can get out of control rather quickly and build up around you 
before you know it. It was once said that a messy office is a sign of genius . . . 
in that case, I’m Albert Einstein!
Keep yourself organized by following these simple-sounding but not always 
easy-to-apply ideas:
 
✓ Have a place for everything. Visit a container store or the storage sec-
tion of any big box store and you’ll be amazed at the number of different 
storage containers available. Pens, pencils, brushes, and ink should have 
their own storage areas. These can be as simple or as elaborate as you 
want to make them. Label each container so you can easily determine 
the contents. You may also consider having a divider in each container 
so that you can separate things like brushes and pens from each other.
 
✓ Clean. Get out your cleaning supplies and go to it. Clean your monitor, 
keyboard, desk, and any other work areas.
 
✓ Clear away the clutter. Throw away any unnecessary papers or other 
mess from your desk. If some paperwork is important but you don’t 
need it right now, file it in well-marked folders.
 
✓ Use filing cabinets or storage drawers to keep your cartoons and other 
art organized. They’re a good idea because they can help you protect 
your original art.
 
✓ Use traditional, blueprint-style drafting cabinets with wide, shallow 
drawers to hold large sheets of paper. Often called flat files, they’re per-
fect for storing original art because the drawers aren’t deep and you can 
easily access the art you’re searching for.
Getting the Right Supplies
Having the necessary drawing supplies at hand is as important to a cartoon-
ist as having the right equipment in the operating room is to a surgeon. 
Various types of pens and pencils, art charcoal, pastels, art markers, and inks 
are available and cover a wide artistic range when it comes to drawing.
 
When you walk into an arts and crafts store, you’ll see tons of different 
options. You want to be versatile with the tools you practice and sketch with 
so that you continue experimenting and improving. However, you don’t want 

40
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
to overdo it and buy too much. Some supplies can be expensive, so when first 
starting out, purchase just what you need. As you get more experience, you 
can buy the supplies that you really want.
Not sure what basic supplies to purchase when setting up your workspace? 
No worries. This section walks you through the supplies you need to get your 
workspace up and running.
Picking pens and pencils
Start off with pens and pencils, the most basic drawing tools. Explore the 
numerous types on the market to see what you’re comfortable drawing with, 
starting with some of the following:
 
✓ Pencils: Pencils are great for sketching because they provide a nice 
soft line that you can easily go over with ink. Don’t use a pencil that’s 
too dark, because you want the pencil lines to be easy to erase and 
you don’t want them to be noticeable when the cartoon is reproduced, 
scanned, or copied. In fact, a simple, everyday pencil can do the job, 
though I prefer to use nonphoto blue pencils, because I don’t have to 
erase my lines after I ink them. 
 
 When choosing a pencil, keep in mind that the higher the B# of a pencil, 
the softer the graphite and the harder it is to erase. The higher H# of a 
pencil, the harder the graphite is.
 
 However, if your style is such that you want to just use a pencil and not 
ink over the lines, then the computer can come in handy. You can draw 
with a pencil, scan that drawing into the computer, and convert the 
lines to true black. This technique also allows your work to have a nice 
sketchy look as opposed to the smoother, cleaner look of inked lines. 
Take time to experiment.
 
✓ Dip pens: Dip pens have a metal nib and are usually mounted on a 
wooden handle. You dip the metal end nib into a bottle of ink. The dip 
pen has been a standard among cartoonists throughout history. This 
type of pen works well and produces nice dark lines, although you must 
be careful not to smear the lines before they dry.
 
✓ Pigma Micron pens: Most cartoonists use these pens in some capacity, 
for drawing or for lettering. They come in a variety of sizes and contain a 
long-lasting, nonfading archival ink.
 
Cartooning is a commercial style of art, and professionals must always con-
sider how their art will reproduce when choosing a drawing tool. For example, 
it’s probably not practical to use a charcoal pencil to draw cartoons with, as 
charcoal doesn’t reproduce as well as a sharp pen or a brush and ink does.

41
 Chapter 3: Getting Your Workspace Ready to Go
Other drawing supplies
Writing utensils aren’t the only thing on your shopping list when stocking 
your work station. You also need a few other supplies specific to drawing, 
such as the items in this section.
The right paper
Paper to use for drawing is imperative to have on hand, and different papers 
produce different results. Having good drawing paper is essential because its 
performance is crucial to the line art you end up producing.
The industry standard for drawing paper is Strathmore Bristol drawing 
paper. This paper is heavy and provides a strong surface to work on without 
the need for mounting. Bristol comes in a variety of finishes that are best 
suited for different types of media. Smooth finish is good for pen and ink and 
allows for the use of washes and even airburshing. The vellum is good for all 
pencil work as well as charcoal or pastels.
These come in pads of usually 20–25 sheets and range in sizes from 9 x 12 
up to over 22 x 28 inches. Generally, the smooth finish is best for drawing 
cartoons. The only drawback can be cost in relation to the number of actual 
sheets of paper you get.
 
If you’re just starting out, you may want to consider drawing on copy paper. 
You can get 500 sheets of copy paper for half the cost of 20 sheets of Bristol 
drawing paper, so if you make a mistake or change your mind, it won’t cost 
you much to throw the sheet away and start over (but do be good to Mother 
Nature and recycle). I used to use Bristol drawing paper but switched to using 
cheap copy paper. I made this decision several years ago when I realized that 
it really didn’t matter what kind of paper I drew on because I was going to 
scan it into the computer, and the computer file would ultimately be the final 
piece of art. 
Brushes
Most professional artists and cartoonists use a brush, although no brushes 
are made specifically for cartooning. Many cartoonists commonly use 
watercolor brushes. More specifically, the Winsor & Newton Sceptre Gold II 
brushes work best for inking and are relatively inexpensive. They’re made for 
watercolors but work great for use with ink.
 
When shopping for a brush, ask other cartoonists what they like to use. You 
can also ask the clerk in the arts and crafts store for a recommendation. 
Before you make a purchase, try out a couple of different brushes. Find a 
brush whose bristles don’t fray and that can hold a nice sharp point.

42
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
Ink
Inking, the term for going over a pencil sketch with black ink, is typically the 
final step in the drawing process. Inking gives that final spark of life to the 
drawing and makes the art crisp and tight. Inking over your work with a nice 
black line creates artwork that can be easily reproduced. Higgins waterproof 
black India ink is pretty much the standard ink used by most cartoonists. You 
can get it in small bottles or larger 32-ounce bottles that you can use to pour 
into a small bottle to dip your brush in. 
 
You may also want to take the cap off and let it set out for a while. Like a good 
wine, ink that’s allowed to breathe tends to perform better.
Visiting the Computer Store
When you think about cartooning, a computer may not be the first thing that 
comes to mind. But computers in today’s cartoon world are as important a 
tool as the pencil. Although you may still draw all your art on paper using the 
traditional pen and ink technique, a computer enables you to scan in your 
cartoons, e-mail art files, and color your comics.
Furthermore, many artists, cartoonists, and graphic designers don’t use 
paper at all anymore — they actually draw right in the computer! In this sec-
tion, I look at several hardware devices and software programs that cartoon-
ists and artists commonly use.
Selecting the right computer
Choosing the right computer is a crucial decision that’s based on many factors, 
including size, speed, power, and, of course, cost. When choosing a computer, 
you need to consider its reliability, memory and CPU speed, and storage.
Although personal computers (PCs) dominate the business world, Apple 
Macintosh computers dominate the creative art world, including the world 
of cartooning and comics. Macs tend to be a bit more user-friendly than PCs 
and geared toward a more creative user, with a more colorful and easy-to-
understand desktop. 
Macs also plug and play more easily than PCs. Plug and play basically means 
that you can just plug in an external device like a printer or scanner without 
having to do any extensive programming to get the device to work, other 
than loading the manufacturer’s software. Although you can plug and play 
using a PC, Mac’s plug and play capacities are more user-friendly.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Workspace Ready to Go
If you’re interested in buying a Mac computer, the best resource for more 
information or to place an order is the Apple Web site (www.apple.com). 
You can also visit any one of the numerous Apple stores to try out one of the 
computers in person.
Customizing your hardware
If you’re under 30, you were seemingly born hardwired to use computers. If 
you’re a little older, though, or if you really want to get the most out of your 
computer, you need to know some hardware fundamentals.
Hard drives
Computers hold a tremendous amount of information, which has to be stored 
someplace. That’s what hard drives are for — they permanently store your 
computer’s information — at least until you decide to delete it. Obviously, a 
larger hard drive can hold more information, including more high resolution 
cartoon files that, over time, can take up lots and lots of space. Hard drive 
space comes in what’s known as gigs, which is short for gigabyte (abbreviated 
GB). When you’re starting out, I suggest you get an 80GB hard drive; it should 
last you many years.
External hard drive
If you need additional storage space, an external hard drive for around $100 
can provide you with hundreds of GBs of storage. More important, you need 
to buy an external hard drive so that you can back up all your files. Backing 
up files means making a copy of them onto another hard drive. Doing so can 
save your life if you misplace a file or, heaven forbid, your main hard drive 
crashes and you can’t access it. If you have an external drive you have every-
thing saved, which gives you peace of mind.
RAM
Random access memory, or RAM for short, is like your computer’s short-term 
memory bank. Information stored as RAM includes application programs, oper-
ating systems, and current data. RAM is much faster to read from and write to 
than the other kinds of storage in a computer, like the hard disk or a CD-ROM, 
but when you turn your computer off, the data in RAM is lost and has to be 
reloaded from the hard drive by your computer when you turn it back on. 
The more RAM your computer has, the faster it can process things — like 
commands in Photoshop, for example. You should start out with at least 2GB 
of RAM; you can purchase additional RAM pretty cheap these days, so I’d 
recommend not skimping on it. If you want more memory than the computer 
comes with, you can get a GB of RAM for under $100 and install it yourself in 
most modern Macs. A good online resource for ordering additional RAM is a 
company called Crucial (www.crucial.com).

CPU speed
A Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is usually known simply as your computer’s 
processor. You can upload files, surf the Internet, and work in a program like 
Photoshop all at the same time if your computer has a fast CPU. CPU speed 
is generally measured in gigahertz, or GHz. The current crop of Macs range 
from 1.6 GHz all the way up to 3.2 GHz, which is pretty darn fast. This kind of 
speed can handle full video or animation without any problems. 
If you’re just starting out it’s best to begin with a computer that may have too 
much CPU speed and memory. You will eventually use it up, trust me!
CD/DVD drives
CD/DVD drives are devices used to store and back up your work, especially 
if you need to copy an image onto a disc and send it to a potential editor or 
freelance client. You can either order a CD/DVD drive at the time you order 
your computer or buy an aftermarket portable drive. Disc drives are indis-
pensible for burning files on a compact disc for storage or for sending art 
files to clients, for example. Blank CDs are cheap (as little as 15 cents apiece 
if you buy in bulk), so you can send them out to clients without worrying 
about getting them back. If your computer has a DVD drive, you can use 
DVDs to store backup files, as they have a lot more storage than CDs.
 
The best thing to do is get a combo drive, which can read and write CDs and 
read (and sometimes write) DVDs, because you get the best of both worlds in 
one drive. On all Macs except the entry-level Mac Mini, the SuperDrive, a CD/
DVD reader/writer, comes standard.
Modem or wireless Internet connection
You gotta stay connected in today’s global market. Fast, reliable Internet 
access is a must for staying in contact with clients and other contacts, 
uploading and downloading files, and research. Today, most computers come 
with built-in internal modems and wireless capability, so you can stay con-
nected wherever you are. Check with your local Internet service provider 
(ISP) to see what modem and access connection options are available in your 
area and for remote connections.
Scanners
As far as cartoonists are concerned, a scanner is an absolute must. A scanner 
is a handy computer peripheral designed to transform images from real-life 
photos, drawings, and text into a digitized document. A scanner reads an 
image and converts it into a collection of dots that can be stored as a file on a 
hard disk. With special software like Photoshop, you can edit and manipulate 
the image.

45
 Chapter 3: Getting Your Workspace Ready to Go
A scanner works on the principle of light reflection. Imagine, for instance, a 
light shining on a page of a magazine. The white background reflects light, 
the black text absorbs it, and the shades of gray (or colors) in a photograph 
reflect the light in varying degrees, depending on their densities. Think of 
a scanner as a digital copy machine that, instead of copying the image on a 
piece of paper that pops out of the slot on the side of the machine, copies the 
image and it pops up on the computer screen instead.
See Chapter 16 for more information about cartooning using scanners and 
computer equipment.
Printer
A printer is an incredibly important tool for your cartooning work station. 
After you finish scanning in your sketches and reworking them on your com-
puter, you need to have a hard copy. A printer allows you to print out your 
work that you may have colored using a computer program so that you can 
have something to show people. You can also print out samples to send to 
potential editors or freelance clients.
When choosing a printer, you basically have two choices:
 
✓ Color ink jet printer: This option remains the best all-around choice for 
many casual users. Ink jet printers are ideal for home users who need 
to print text pages, color graphics (such as greeting cards or flyers), 
and color photos. An ink jet printer is an especially good choice if you 
already own a flatbed color scanner. With a scanner, you suddenly have 
the equivalent of a multifunction printer — for a whole lot less.
 
✓ Laser printer: A laser printer is another option. Much like the ink jet 
printer, the laser printer is capable of printing out nice clean copies of 
your work. Choosing a printer also depends on the hardware you’re using 
and which printers are most compatible with your particular computer.
 
Rather than take up valuable office space with multiple individual pieces of 
equipment, consider saving both money and space by buying an all-in-one 
device that combines a printer, copier, scanner, and fax machine into one 
handy unit.
Monitor
A computer monitor can be expensive, but it’s well worth it to invest in a 
good one that offers the best resolution and is large enough to use as a work-
ing desktop. Computer monitors have evolved in recent years, and just like 
TVs, they come in a variety of formats.

46
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
You basically have two types of configurations to look for when purchasing a 
computer monitor:
 
✓ Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor: CRT monitors are an affordable 
solution; however, they’re bulky and very heavy.
 
✓ Flat panel/Liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor: These monitors are 
similar to what you’d find on a laptop computer. Bottom line: Go with 
the LCD because, overall, they generally display sharper images, are 
lighter, and are more space-efficient because they’re thin, like a plasma 
TV. Despite these advantages, they’re a little more expensive, although 
costs are coming down all the time.
Tablet
A tablet is a device that has a flat plastic surface which you draw on with a 
stylus. The stylus is an instrument that you hold in your hand, just like you 
would a pen. The stylus leaves no mark on the tablet, but the tablet is sensi-
tive to the position of the stylus and moves a cursor on the computer moni-
tor, which acts as a brush or pencil and can fill in areas of color on a page. 
Although tricky to get the hang of at first, the hand and eye quickly get used 
to this drawing method, and most cartoonists enjoy working this way (it’s 
far easier to draw this way than with a mouse). You can achieve very similar 
effects to traditional ways of drawing with a tablet. One of the most popular 
and common models of tablets is the Wacom Tablet, which costs between 
$300 to $5,000 depending on the model and options you choose.
Identifying the software you need
Computer programs are an important tool for cartooning in a digital age. 
It’s safe to say that in today’s world, most cartoonists — whether they draw 
comic strips, editorial cartoons, panel cartoons, comic books, greeting cards, 
webcomics, or animation — use computer programs in some fashion. The fol-
lowing sections focus on the three most commonly used software programs 
available.
Using Photoshop
Photoshop is the program most cartoonists use. It enables you to do all sorts 
of cool things to alter images like photos, downloaded icons, and scanned 
artwork. Altering an image includes changing its colors, modifying its size and 
scale, and putting one picture within another. Image alteration or modifica-
tion also includes technical adjustments such as changing the mode of image 
compression from one type to another, or changing the number of bits used 
per pixel.

47
 Chapter 3: Getting Your Workspace Ready to Go
In addition to altering images, Photoshop has a vast array of tools that help 
you create images from scratch. On the Web, you often need to make custom 
icons, buttons, lines, balls, or text art. Photoshop makes all this excessively 
easy and fun.
 
Photoshop is not a “classic” drawing or image creation program. Unlike a 
drawing program that stores information about images as mathematical 
expressions (called vectors), when Photoshop draws a line, the line is con-
verted into little dots, called pixels. (See the “Comprehending vectors” sidebar 
for an explanation of the difference between vectors and pixels.) When small 
enough, and with blended colors, these dots can come to look like lines. Of 
course, when magnified or reduced, the optical illusion is dispelled and you get 
ugly, choppy lines. Check out Chapter 16 for more info on using Photoshop.
Using Adobe Illustrator
Photoshop isn’t the only Adobe game in town. Illustrator, another Adobe 
product, is primarily used to create graphics and logos, but like Photoshop, 
it can also manipulate, color, or enhance existing images or artwork. The dif-
ference between how Illustrator and Photoshop create images has to do with 
what’s known as vectors.
The primary advantage in using a vector-based program like Illustrator is that 
the image you create can be blown up as big as you want and it won’t show 
any pixilation or distortion. This is especially helpful when you need to blow 
up an image or logo the size of a billboard, for example. 
Using Painter by Corel
Painter, a program produced by a company called Corel, is very much like 
Photoshop. And like Photoshop, it’s gaining popularity among cartoonists. 
Painter also uses the layering process and has similar tools and the same 
abilities to import images into the program and then change, copy, color, and 
manipulate them. The difference between the two comes down to personal 
preference. If you can afford it, buy them both!
Comprehending vectors
Computer displays are made up of small dots 
called pixels. The picture is built up from these 
dots. The smaller the dots are and the closer 
they are together, the better the quality of the 
image, but the bigger the file needed to store 
the data. If the image is magnified, the resolu-
tion deteriorates and it becomes grainy — our 
eyes are able to pick out individual pixels. 
In contrast, a vector graphics program uses 
a mathematical sequence to construct the 
screen image with graphics files that store 
the lines, shapes, and colors of the image. The 
mathematical data determines where the dots 
that make up the image should be placed for the 
best quality image possible.

Starting with the Drawing Basics
In This Chapter
▶ Practicing simple shapes and rough sketches
▶ Inking your cartoons
▶ Using shading and crosshatching to give your cartoons tone and texture
▶ Correcting your mistakes
F
or many artists, drawing is instinctive — they pick up a pencil and can 
easily draw impressive sketches. If you’re like that — if you already have 
a firm grasp on drawing basics — then this chapter is probably a tad simple 
for you. 
However, if you weren’t born with natural drawing ability but you’ve always 
liked to doodle or wanted to better develop your drawing skills, then this 
chapter is for you. Even if you don’t have an ounce of artistic talent, you can 
greatly improve your ability to draw cartoons and comics by trying your 
hand at these techniques. And even if you do have a firm foundation for 
drawing, you still may want to review some of these techniques before jump-
ing into sketching cartoons. However, always remember that cartooning is a 
creative undertaking with room for personal interpretation and experimenta-
tion. Make sure you have fun, or spending time drawing isn’t worth your time.
In this chapter, I show you how to start cartooning by drawing three-
dimensionally and then advance to techniques that enhance your cartoons, 
such as inking, shading, crosshatching, and fixing your inevitable mistakes 
without destroying your entire cartoon.

Putting Pencil to Paper
If you’re like many artists, you’ve probably been drawing since you could 
first hold a pencil. But even if you’ve been drawing for years, putting pencil 
to paper for the first time in a professional manner can be intimidating. Not 
to worry, though — I’m here to help. Your goal is to get to the point where 
drawing cartoons comes so naturally that you don’t have to think about what 
you draw. This section gives you tips on making cartooning as natural as 
writing your name.
On the other hand, you may be picking up a pencil to cartoon for the first 
time. Perhaps you’re just addressing an interest in drawing that you’ve 
ignored for quite some time, or maybe you want to take up a new hobby. This 
section provides you the basic tools to start cartooning and perfect your art 
over time. Figuring out how to draw is mostly a matter of practice, so start 
simple and advance your art using the information in this chapter to get a 
more professional look.
Knowing what pencil (and paper) to use
You may be ready to pick up a pencil but have questions about what type 
of pencil to use. Is any old pencil you pull out of the junk drawer okay? If 
you’re planning to get serious about drawing, choosing a pencil and paper 
is a matter of personal preference. Go to an art store, ask the sales associate 
for some assistance, buy a few types and experiment until you find what feels 
most comfortable to you. The best bet is to try out many different types to 
see what works.
You’ll probably be using a pencil to do light sketching and then inking over 
the light sketch with either a pen or brush and ink. With that in mind, I sug-
gest you use a pencil that isn’t too dark when applied to the paper and that 
you can easily erase after you’ve inked your line art.
Likewise, the paper you choose should feel good to you when you’re drawing 
on it. The paper should provide the right surface for the tools you’re using 
and help you achieve the type of line quality and performance you desire. 
Check out Chapter 3 for more discussion on the types of pencils, brushes, 
and paper available.

51
 Chapter 4: Starting with the Drawing Basics
Going from lines to making shapes
Drawing isn’t rocket science. You don’t need to have an advanced degree to 
be able to sketch interesting and compelling characters and drawings. You 
just need to know how to start with some simple shapes — circles, squares, 
triangles, and rectangles — and then build on them. These shapes translate 
into basic cartoon designs and forms — like heads, bodies, and buildings — 
when you put them together. Everything you draw is essentially based on 
simple shapes.
After you master simple shapes and the different ways they can be put 
together, you’ll be better able to understand more complex things like per-
spective. Get a feel for drawing shapes so you can draw and manipulate them 
easily and have fun doing it.
After you feel comfortable drawing basic shapes, you can start to turn them 
into more complex objects and give them dimension. In real life, when you 
look at an object, you see it in three dimensions, meaning you can see some 
part of the front, side, and top, all at the same time. (If you see more than 
three sides, you’re either looking in a mirror or you’re an alien with more 
than two eyes!)
For example, start with a square, or box. A simple square appears flat (as in 
Figure 4-1), which is okay for some objects you draw, but not for others. (Most 
of the time, you want your basic square to have a three-dimensional look.)
 
Figure 4-1: 
This square 
appears flat 
and one-
dimensional.
 

52
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
If you want to draw a television, for instance, drawing a flat square shape 
doesn’t give you a realistic look (see Figure 4-2).
 
Figure 4-2: 
The TV 
looks flat 
and one-
dimensional.
 
To draw a three-dimensional box shape, follow these steps:
 
1. Draw a box shape approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter (see 
Figure 4-3a).
 
2. Draw another box shape that overlaps the first box, as in Figure 4-3b.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Start your 
three-
dimensional 
box with 
two over-
lapping 
squares.

3. Connect each corner of the first box diagonally to each corresponding 
corner of the second box, like in Figure 4-4a.
 
  Now you have a three-dimensional box!

parent box

4. Erase all the inside lines on the front, top, and side of the box (refer to 
Figure 4-4b).
 
 Erase the inside lines and your framed cube suddenly becomes a solid 
object. This is necessary if the object you’re drawing is actually solid, 
like a TV for example. If you don’t erase the lines, the object appears like 
a frame you can see through, and it won’t be a solid object.
 
5. After you have a solid box to work with, you can make it into any 
number of objects.
 
 One classic boxed-shaped object is a TV. To turn your box into a TV, 
draw a smaller square shape inside the front of the box cube to create 
your TV screen.
 
6. Add the finishing details to make it look like a TV.
 
 Next to the TV screen, add a few knobs and a long rectangle to represent 
the speaker, as in Figure 4-5.

Your TV now 
has a three-

look.

Doing rough sketches
Rough sketches are the visual note-taking of the cartoon world. Just as a 
writer jots down many, many notes in preparation for writing the next great 
American novel, the cartoonist draws many, many rough sketches.
Rough sketches should be just what they say they are — rough. Don’t spend 
too much time on them, because they’re just meant to capture the basic idea 
and layout of your composition so you have it when you want to develop the 
idea further.
Making rough sketches doesn’t require you to follow any specific rules. 
Rough sketches may be little more than a series of stick figures or other 
loose scribbles quickly jotted down on a scrap piece of paper or on the back 
of an envelope, as in Figure 4-6. Do what works best for you.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Rough 
sketches 
are loose 
and simple.
 
 
Ideas may come to you at any time and any place, so make sure you’re pre-
pared to put them down on paper in the form of a rough sketch by always 
having paper and pencil with you. (Chapter 5 gives you some hands-on direc-
tion about the ins and outs of rough sketching.) Then later, when you’re in 
your workspace ready to draw your next creation, you can quickly refer to the 
rough sketches so that you don’t forget any of your ideas.
Tightening up your sketch
After you make a rough sketch and like the idea and are ready to move on, 
the next step is to tighten up your sketch. Tightening up a sketch means 
to define the lines so that the characters, word balloons, background, and 

55
 Chapter 4: Starting with the Drawing Basics
overall composition are clearer and more defined. This is the stage when 
the final composition comes into focus and you can see how the line art will 
look prior to beginning the inking process (see Figure 4-7).
When you tighten up your sketch, you simply go over your first loose sketch 
and darken it up while further defining the characters. This is the stage 
where your drawings become cleaner and come into focus.
 
Figure 4-7: 
As you 
tighten 
up the 
sketch, your 
cartoon

more

Grasping the Art of Inking
Inking is the final stage in the black-and-white drawing process. Inking is simply 
taking the pencil sketch and using it as a guide to complete the illustration, so 
that the finished product is a crisp, clean, black-and-white line art drawing. You 
can use a brush and ink or a pen to ink your work; which tools you choose is a 
matter of personal preference. Experiment to see what works best for you.
 
The purpose of inking in cartoons relates mainly to reproduction. Cartoons 
are generally reprinted in newspapers, magazines, and books. But art that’s 
done only in pencil doesn’t always reproduce well because the lines can drop 
out or get overexposed and look darker than they should. Inking allows for the 
best possible reproduced art, because black-and-white line art that’s inked 
usually comes out looking just as you created it. Inking with a brush allows 
you to achieve a line art quality that you simply can’t achieve using any other 
tool or medium.
Using a brush and ink is also fun! Most cartoonists view the inking stage as 
the most enjoyable because it’s when your art begins to come alive and jump 
off the page. This section helps you get a firm grasp of inking basics.

56
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
Understanding how using a brush 
differs from pens and pencils
The inking process is a bit different from other steps in the drawing process. 
Using a brush to ink is different from using other drawing tools like pens and 
pencils because you have to control the brush in a totally different manner.
Using pens and pencils is all about keeping constant contact between the 
end of the tool and the paper. When you draw with a pen or pencil, you typi-
cally apply a constant amount of pressure so that you’re always producing an 
unvaried, consistent line on the paper.
However, using a brush is quite different. If you apply the same amount of 
pressure to the brush as you do to a pen, you end up with a huge mess and 
a frayed brush. The key to using a brush is in the wrist; applying varying 
amounts of pressure to the brush produces light but varied lines — thin lines 
when desired and thicker ones when and where you choose.
Getting comfortable with using a brush
Before you can get a firm grasp on inking, I have one important piece of 
advice: Make the brush your friend and use it. To get better at inking, you 
need to practice and practice some more. It can be frustrating at first, but 
you’ll find that the rewards far outweigh the suffering you go through trying 
to master this tool.
 
A fairly inexpensive good brush to start with is a Winsor Newton Sceptre Gold 
II watercolor brush. This brush has a pretty standard bristle size and is good 
for detailing as well as achieving thick line variations.
Inking 101: The how-to
To actually use a brush to ink your sketches, follow these steps:
 
1. Before using your new brush, dip it in a brush cleaner and twirl the 
end so that it acquires a sharp pointed edge.
 
 Leave it out overnight. Doing so allows the individual bristles to form to 
a nice pointed shape and prevents any loose bristles from fraying.
 
2. After you’re satisfied that the brush tip is nice and sharp, dip about 
3/4 of the brush into an open ink bottle so that you pick up a sufficient 
amount of ink.

57
 Chapter 4: Starting with the Drawing Basics
 
 Don’t dip the brush all the way in because you’ll get ink up around the 
base, and when this dries it will cause the brush to fray. In between dips 
to load your brush with ink, dip your brush in a small container of water 
and shake it to clean out any excess ink before it has time to dry.
 
3. To draw a thin line, apply the brush to the paper using a light amount 
of pressure.
 
 This action feels much different than using a pencil. Glide the brush 
across the paper rather than pushing it. 
 
4. To make your line thicker, just add more pressure.
 
 However, don’t go too heavy or you’ll have a big mess on your hands. It 
takes lots of practice. The key to success is to combine thick and thin 
lines to produce a drawing composed of varied line thickness through-
out, as in Figure 4-8.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Varied line 
thickness 
adds inter-
est and 
appeal to 
your line art.
 
 
One way to begin to get the hang of inking is to simply get out a piece of scrap 
paper (I like using 11-x-17-inch copy paper) and repeatedly draw lines in a vari-
ety of lengths and thicknesses. This is a good way to master the relationship 
between the amount of pressure you apply and the kind of line thickness it 
will produce. The lines on the left in Figure 4-9 are the result of slight pressure, 
while the lines on the right are the result of a heavier amount of pressure.
If you study the works of Walt Kelly, Pat Oliphant, or Bill Watterson, you 
notice that they have a wonderful line quality that gives their art an ener-
getic, vibrant character. Many people find this part of their cartoons exciting, 
even if they don’t quite fathom how it’s done. But you can achieve the same 
results with your brush. Just experiment. Try different methods until one 
works best for you.

Erasing sketch lines
After you ink your drawing, you need to get rid of your original sketch lines 
for the following reasons:
 
✓ The ink lines don’t always cover them. The point of the pencil sketch 
was just to have a loose guide for you to use in the inking process. 
 
✓ If you scan your work into the computer, the scanner may pick up the 
pencil lines. The lines may appear as little dots or lines along your inked 
line art. It’s best to erase them, or do what I do and use a nonphoto blue 
pencil to sketch with that doesn’t reproduce.
To get rid of the sketch lines easily and effectively, try these ideas:
 
✓ Sketch your pencil lines lightly so you won’t have to work too hard to 
erase them later.
 
✓ Make sure you use a permanent, waterproof ink that doesn’t smear when 
dried so you avoid smears when erasing the pencil sketch underneath.
 
✓ Use a kneaded eraser, which is best suited for removing graphite pencil 
lines.
 
✓ Consider using a nonphoto blue pencil so you won’t have to erase the 
pencil lines at all. Nonphoto blue isn’t picked up by a scanner or camera.
Creating Tone and Texture
Tone and texture can add depth and help a flat drawing look more dimen-
sional. Because cartoons deal primarily with black-and-white line art, utiliz-
ing techniques such as shading and crosshatching creates tone and texture. 

59
 Chapter 4: Starting with the Drawing Basics
Tone and texture help define the shape you’re drawing and add depth to the 
art. Without tone and texture, the line art looks flat and bare and may not 
covey the right perspective, dimension, or relationship to the other elements 
drawn around it. This section shows you how to do both techniques.
Shading
You can use shading to add depth and dimension to your sketch. Shading 
is the process of darkening an area of your sketch to give the impression 
of depth. The specific shading technique you use depends on the type of 
medium you use to create your drawing.
Although the computer has become the device of choice to shade and color 
cartoons in the modern age (I discuss shading using a computer in Chapter 
16), you may want to be a bit more hands-on with your shading when you’re 
first starting to draw. If so, the following traditional methods and techniques 
are still in use and worth examining.
With a pencil
Shading with a pencil is pretty straightforward. If you draw a cube with a 
pencil, shading the cube on one side to add depth is easy because a pencil 
is a soft medium and is able to produce gray, shade-type tones (see Figure 
4-10). To shade with a pencil, use the side of the pencil lead. Doing so creates 
a softer line quality as you move it back and forth in the area you’re shading.

tones.
 
With ink
If you decide to shade with ink, you don’t get the same effect as with a pencil 
because ink isn’t transparent in its natural form. Ink is solid and reproduces 
as a dark solid value when it’s printed. To shade with ink, simply fill in the 

60
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
area you’re shading so that it’s totally black. This can create a dramatic light/
dark effect. Don’t do this, however, if you need some tonal gradation in the 
area you’re shading, because it will be uniformly dark.
 
Inking in one side of a square-shaped object works better (see Figure 4-11a) 
than inking in a side of a round-shaped object. On a round object, a solid 
black area can lack the gradient quality needed to convey an accurate three-
dimensional form (see Figure 4-11b). To address this problem, see the 
“Crosshatching” section later in this chapter.

With washes
Washes are methods that have been used for hundreds of years to create 
shade and tonal value in illustrations and other art destined for newsprint. 
Washes, which are gray in color, are used to shade an illustration.
Washes are generally ink that’s been watered down until it’s a much lighter, 
transparent consistency. To apply a wash, you use a watercolor brush to 
dip into the wash and cover over the areas you want to shade, usually on a 
watercolor-based paper. To achieve the right gray shade, mix water in with a 
small amount of ink until you get the shade you want (see Figure 4-12).
The results of washes are very similar to watercolor except that washes 
are always some shade of gray. The technique is still very much in use in 
cartoons that are regularly published in The New Yorker magazine, among 
others. The technique results in a toned-down, more sophisticated looking 
composition.
 
If you’re coloring your sketches in Photoshop, you can rely on several filters 
and brush options to achieve a similar effect digitally. Check out Chapter 16 
for more on shading with Photoshop.

With markers
If you want to shade your sketches with markers, you have a wide variety 
of design markers on the market to choose from to create bold lines that are 
perfect for shading. They come in a variety of colors as well as several differ-
ent shades of gray, which are great for shading.
To shade with design markers, you basically color in the areas designated 
to be shaded. The more you go over the first layer, the darker your shading 
will be. Design markers have traditionally been used in design-specific profes-
sions like architecture, fashion, and interior design. They produce a predict-
able, modular line quality, like in Figure 4-13. You can use them in a quick, 
loose manner to create a stylized shading technique.

Crosshatching
If you want to create a tonal quality using black and white, you can use a 
technique called crosshatching. Just as the name implies, crosshatching 
means to draw vertical lines in one direction and then cross over them with 
diagonal or horizontal lines.
Crosshatching is a technique best suited for applications in which other 
forms of shading may not reproduce well. This is especially true with regard 
to newsprint. Most newspapers print their pages in black and white, so shad-
ing your art using a gray wash or even color won’t turn out well. Also, news-
papers have a tendency to run images smaller than the cartoonist originally 
intended. If you color your art or use a watercolor wash, when the image is 
reduced down and reproduced on the page, the shading technique fails as 
the area appears solid and the image may lose any tonal quality.
When a crosshatched image is reduced, the quality of the reproduced and 
scaled-down art is much better. This is one reason why crosshatching became 
popular among editorial cartoonists and newsprint political illustrators.
Crosshatching creates a darker tone but not a solid one. You can vary your 
tones by changing the number of lines you draw and where you place them. 
If you want to add a slight tonal value to a shape, simply drawing lines on one 
side of the shape adds an element of dimension. For example, the figure on 
the right in Figure 4-14 is what the box looks like before you begin to cross-
hatch. The more lines you draw in a diagonal direction over the previous 
lines, the darker the crosshatching gets and the more dimension you can give 
a shape, as shown in the figure on the left in Figure 4-14.

Fixing Mistakes
Nobody’s perfect; every artist makes mistakes. And most cartoonists change 
their mind at least once when they’re sketching out an idea. The more you 
draw, the more you’ll change your mind.
When you do make a mistake or change your mind, don’t panic. Although 
the easiest and fastest way to deal with a change is to start over with a fresh 
piece of paper, you’re probably not interested in killing a small rainforest 
while sketching, right? You don’t have to throw your sketch away and start 
from scratch. Most mistakes usually have an easy solution. 
This section examines some tried and true methods for fixing your mistakes. 
Some of these methods and techniques may seem primitive, but they get the 
job done!
Using an eraser
You’ve probably been using an eraser since you were in kindergarten. 
Erasers are pretty easy to use to take care of small mistakes. You need to 
include a traditional rubber eraser as well as a kneaded eraser in your arse-
nal of tools to meet any erasing challenge. A kneaded eraser is a pliable mate-
rial that has the consistency of putty. It doesn’t wear away and leave behind 
eraser “crumbs”; as a result, it lasts much longer than other erasers. Kneaded 
erasers can be shaped by hand for erasing minute details.
Kneaded erasers are commonly used to remove light charcoal or graphite 
marks and in subtractive drawing techniques (when you want to erase out 
white lines against a dark or completely blacked-out background). However, 
they’re ill-suited for completely erasing large areas, and they may smear or 
stick if they get too warm. Though they don’t wear away like other erasers, 
they can become exhausted and unable to absorb any more graphite or 
charcoal. When this happens, they should be replaced with a fresh kneaded 
eraser.
 
One simple thing to remember when erasing is to be sure to wait until the ink 
has fully dried before erasing pencil lines. If you start erasing and the inked 
line art starts to smear, you may have a huge problem on your hands and one 
that’s very difficult to fix.

Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
Mastering cut and paste
After you ink your drawing, you may discover that you don’t like the way a 
part of it looks. You’ve probably invested several hours in the inking process, 
and you may have done so using expensive drawing paper — not something 
you want to throw out unless you have to.
If so, you can cut and paste a new sketch over an area you want to change. 
The quickest way to do this is to redraw the portion of the cartoon you want 
to edit on another scrap piece of paper. Simply cut out the image and paste it 
over the area you want changed.
For example (and I speak from experience here), say that you draw a face 
and decide that you want it to look in a different direction after you ink it 
up. You can draw the face on a separate piece of paper — preferably a light 
bond copy paper — and then cut it out and paste it over the area you want to 
change.
 
Using light bond copy paper allows you to adhere the patch onto the master 
drawing without creating a bulky lump that may hinder your ability to place 
the original face down on a scanner later on. You can then scan it in your com-
puter and the image looks like one image. You can make any necessary tweaks 
in Photoshop (see Chapter 16).
The joys of white correction fluid
Of all the correction methods I use, the one I use most often is white correc-
tion fluid. Correction fluids are opaque fluids originally created to be applied 
to paper to mask errors in text, specifically those made by a typewriter. 
However, they’re also excellent for covering up mistakes made in black ink. 
The correction fluid generally has great coverage so you can correct the mis-
take in one smooth layer. 
Correction fluid is typically packaged in small bottles. The lid has a small, 
attached, triangular foam brush that dips into the bottle and is used to 
apply the fluid onto the paper. When the correction fluid dries, it creates a 
glass-smooth finish that’s easy to draw over with waterproof black India ink, 
making the original mistake almost undetectable.
More recently, correction fluid has become available in pen form. The pen 
is spring-loaded and, when dabbed onto the paper, releases a small amount 
of fluid. The pen allows for a more precise correction area compared to the 
bottled form. The major drawback, however, is that the pen doesn’t cover 
large areas like the foam brush does.

C
reating a cartoon involves more than just drawing a couple of charac-
ters and having them interact with each other on the page. Most people 
want to be entertained when they read cartoons, so you need to create an 
interesting story that readers want to read. And by the very nature of most 
comic strips, you want to include something humorous in your artwork. If 
you think you can come up with something funny and original to say, then 
you’re off to a great start in becoming a cartoonist. Even if you don’t, no need 
to worry. You can develop a knack for finding creative ideas and including 
humor with just a little work.
You’ve come to the right place if you want to start writing fresh and funny 
story lines. This chapter looks at where to find ideas (don’t worry, they’re 
everywhere!) and what to do with them. I show you ways to set up a joke and 
how to master the art of comedic timing. I also give you tips for coming up 
with ideas when the well runs dry, and I explore the possibilities and pitfalls 
of thinking outside the cartoon box.
Getting Inspired for Storyline Ideas: 
Just Open Your Eyes
The most frequent question professional cartoonists get asked is, “Where do 
you get your ideas?” This question is asked so frequently that I know several 
colleagues who provide canned responses like, “There’s a guy in Newark you 
can write to for ideas. But he won’t send you any unless you promise him 
your sister.” The other famous retort is, “From the Idea Fairy.”

66
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
The real answer to the question is almost as silly as these responses. The 
truth is, ideas are free. All you have to do is open your eyes and look around 
you. They can pop in your head from out of thin air, yours for the taking. 
Just about anything you see, hear, read, or experience can spark an idea if 
you know how to look for them in everyday life.
This section helps you get started in coming up with funny ideas for your 
cartoons and then recording them so you don’t forget them. Use this material 
as a springboard to dive into a wide array of hilarious ideas and themes right 
at your fingertips.
Looking for and keeping track of ideas
Coming up with good ideas isn’t really difficult. You’re sitting on some right 
now and don’t even know it. You just need to realize that almost anything in 
life can be funny if it’s presented correctly.
 
If you can’t think of anything funny off the top of your head, try looking at any 
of the following sources for some ideas. Just be receptive and keep your 
antennae up:
 
✓ Newspaper and magazine articles
 
✓ TV news
 
✓ Things your parents did, once upon a time — start really listening to 
their stories!
 
✓ Things your kids do — really, they’re funny in retrospect
 
✓ Things your pets do — ditto!
 
✓ Your own childhood memories
 
✓ Funny conversations — we all have them, it’s just a matter of 
remembering them
 
✓ Interesting situations or experiences (we all have these, too)
 
✓ Fascinating people you know or meet
 
✓ Tragic events (yes, tragedy can be funny, if it’s handled right)
 
✓ Mundane activities of life — remember, it’s all about the spin you put 
on things
After you find a good topic or issue that sparks your interest, try some free 
association to come up with a list of humorous ideas related to that topic. 
What comes to mind when you think of offices, family life, or your childhood? 

67
 Chapter 5: Coming Up with Ideas
Doodling a little art around your ideas helps bring new ideas to the surface as 
you dig for diamonds in what can sometimes be a big lump of coal mined 
from your experiences and subconscious.
 
After an interesting idea pops into your head, you need to be ready to write it 
down immediately to help you remember it. If you don’t write it down, you’ll 
lose it in the deep crevices of your brain forever. Be prepared to take notes at 
any time — on the train, in the car (pull over first!), at work, in the store, or 
wherever else life takes you. Taking notes becomes a habit — the more often 
you do it, the more ideas will come to you.
Your ideas probably won’t arrive fully formed, so write down all your idea 
fragments — you may be able to develop them into something later. Anything 
will do as a means of transfer from your brain to a more permanent source of 
recollection: napkins, scrap paper, candy wrappers, or whatever else is avail-
able at the given moment.
 
If you actually remember to carry a small notebook with you, even better! 
Or buy a pocket calendar with a lot of white space. Don’t forget something 
to write with also; while writing with a mustard bottle is possible, it’s not 
practical in the long run. Keep a pen with you at all times. Remember that 
taking notes isn’t like a homework assignment. Jotting down notes and ideas 
should be fun and not too complicated.
After you’re in the habit of writing down ideas on a regular basis, it’s impor-
tant to not only take notes but take good notes. You need to develop a visual 
shorthand, pattern, style, or format that works for you. Stick figures and 
quick little scribbles are usually all you need; you don’t have to go into great 
detail or be elaborate. The trick is to just write down a quick outline or even 
just a phrase — whatever will remind you of the idea later.
Connecting ideas to your cartoon’s theme
When devising ideas for your cartoon, one of the best ways to add humor is 
to include it as part of the cartoon’s theme. The theme involves the actions 
or events that are ongoing and repeated. Every comic strip has a theme; it 
may be family life, work life, life in the forest, life on another planet, or any 
combination of the most common themes.
The main idea for your comic strip comes from the characters and the plot 
of the story. For example, say your cartoon centers on a single father and 
his kids. You can expand the idea and have the father and kids live on a 
spaceship, which would give your cartoon a high-tech/futuristic/outer space 

68
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
theme to go along with its family theme. Those themes mean that the cartoon 
would involve the ongoing and amusing challenges of a family living in 
outer space.
Your cartoon’s theme determines its type of humor, because different 
characters find different things amusing. To add humor to your cartoon’s 
theme, look at the situations in your characters’ daily lives. You can find 
humor in even the most ordinary life events if you can identify the element 
of the characters that people can relate to and make that funny.
One reason why comics about kids have always been popular is because 
almost everyone can understand and appreciate the humor. After all, 
everyone was a kid once! It’s a cliché, but kids do say the darnedest things. 
If you have kids as characters, their mispronunciations, malapropisms, and 
misunderstandings provide lots of fodder for funny lines. Animals capture 
readers’ attention for the same reasons — many people have or have had 
pets and can identify with their often outrageous behaviors.
Eyeing some do’s and don’ts to 
writing believable story lines
Writing funny story lines creates characters that people can not only turn 
to for comic relief but also will become attached to over time. Interesting 
story lines allow your characters to develop into individual voices that, when 
separated from the bunch, can offer insight and subtle humor, but together 
offer real synergy. In other words, the sum is greater than the parts.
Whether your comic strip appears in the newspaper or on the Web, you 
may have to create a new story line on a daily basis. Because maintaining a 
believable level of constant hilarity is almost impossible, the humor you 
inject will probably be more subtle than slapstick. Some points you may want 
to consider when writing humorous story lines include:
 
✓ Write story lines that draw upon the characters’ strengths or weak-
nesses. You can exploit your characters’ strengths and (especially) 
weaknesses to provide humor and to have something that reoccurs in 
future story lines. Examples include characters that have a hang-up 
with food, like Garfield and lasagna or Homer Simpson and donuts.
 
✓ Write story lines based on common humorous themes and ideas that 
readers can relate to and recognize in their own life. One example is 
Dilbert and the company he works for. Readers can relate to having to 
go to work with boring coworkers in a mundane job.
 
✓ Write story lines that are funny but not too abstract. If readers don’t 
get the humor, the only person who will think the cartoon is funny 
is you.

69
 Chapter 5: Coming Up with Ideas
 
Meanwhile, some things to avoid:
 
✓ Don’t write story lines that require the reader to have read yester-
day’s cartoon in order to understand the one you wrote today. It’s 
okay to continue story lines over time, but make sure each one can 
stand on its own.
 
✓ Don’t write story lines that are too conceptual. Stick with story lines 
that revolve around basic human interactions and relationships that 
ordinary readers can follow, relate to, and appreciate. For example, if 
your comic is based in outer space, don’t write story lines that require 
the reader to know everything about rocket ships or the solar system.
Keeping Your Sketchbook Close By
Your notebook for jotting down quick ideas or images (which I discuss in the 
section “Looking for and keeping track of ideas”) can also be used as a 
sketchbook. A sketchbook is beneficial because it keeps you drawing, and 
the more you draw, the better you get at it. Unlike the idea entries in your 
notebook, your sketchbook entries may not be tied to any particular idea. 
You may see an interesting building, person on the street, or street scene and 
decide to sketch it — not because it relates to any particular idea but just 
because it’s interesting.
If you’re short of pocket space, you can use the same spiral notebook to do 
double duty for specific ideas and general, “maybe this will come in handy 
someday” sketches. Or you can keep two different books. In either case, 
Peeking inside a few famous sketchbooks
The most famous artist sketchbooks are those 
of Leonardo da Vinci. His sketchbooks are filled 
with drawings, diagrams, and notes on his 
ideas. Of particular interest are the pages in his 
sketchbooks devoted to gliders and flying 
machines. Leonardo designed most of his 
aerial machines after he studied birds. For this 
reason, he designed the machines to generate 
their forward motion by mechanisms that flap 
the wings.
Leonardo’s ideas came from simply observing 
what he saw around him. Remarkably, da Vinci 
did these sketches over 400 years before the 
Wright Brothers invented modern flight. It pays 
to sketch your ideas!
Picasso also produced several hundred 
sketchbooks in his lifetime. He often used his 
sketchbooks to explore themes and make com-
positional studies until he found the right idea 
and subject for a larger painting masterpiece.

70
Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
having something handy to write on or draw on is much better than using 
an old napkin or your shirt sleeve! This section covers the importance of 
sketching in further detail.
 
Purchase a simple, spiral-bound sketchbook and drawing pencil from an art 
supply store. You can also personalize your sketchbook by drawing your own 
cartoon character or a caricature of yourself on the cover.
Why constant sketching keeps you sharp
When you turn on a hot water faucet, the water usually takes a few minutes 
to warm up, depending on how cold the pipes are. But if you turn the faucet 
on again soon after, the water gets hot much more quickly this time.
Creativity is really no different. The longer you let the creative juices flow, 
the hotter the ideas are that come pouring out. The next time you turn on 
your creativity faucet, the easier the ideas flow. So to stay creatively sharp, 
sketch often and sketch everything. By doing so, you may draw something 
that triggers an idea that may never have come to you otherwise.
Your sketchbook should be filled with all sorts of sketches and doodles from 
things you may see, hear, or observe. Though these doodles may be nothing 
more than exercises in free association, they’re a gold mine that you can go 
back to and dig through later. The little doodles can be the seeds that grow 
into a bigger idea down the line.
For example, you may be sitting in a park and hear the roar of a motorcycle 
as it goes by. Later on, you may be sitting in the lobby of an auto shop 
waiting for your car to be fixed. While you’re there, you may glance out 
the window and see a man get out of his car. All these experiences are 
opportunities to scribble something down in your sketchbook. 
An example of this is the sketch in Figure 5-1, which I did several years ago. 
In this sketch/doodle, I drew a big semi truck going over an uncompleted 
freeway overpass. Now, I didn’t actually see a big rig going over a bridge, but 
I had been looking at a freeway being built by the school I was attending and 
had seen numerous semi trucks go by. The drawing came out of my observa-
tions and my attempts at drawing something from an unusual angle or per-
spective. The large concrete pillars that hold up freeways are massive and, 
when looked at from directly below, create a dramatic perspective.

A few months ago I was thinking about different ideas I had for an editorial 
cartoon I wanted to do about the failing U.S. auto industry. The story had 
been all over the news about how the U.S. automakers were suffering big 
losses and were in danger of possibly filing for bankruptcy.
It seemed to me that one of the car companies’ major problems was producing 
huge SUVs that people no longer wanted to buy (unlike a few years ago). Yet 
they continued to build them; it was as if they were willingly driving them-
selves off a cliff. With that idea in mind I remembered a sketch I did showing a 
big truck going over a bridge. I looked up the sketch I had done over five years 
before and used it as the basis of the finished editorial cartoon in Figure 5-2.

Drawing stick figures: 
Cartooning shorthand
When sketching or doodling your ideas, you can draw the simplest and 
roughest kind of sketch just to remind yourself later of what you were think-
ing at that moment. These stick figure sketches act as a handy reminder so 
that you can reference that filing cabinet between your ears later on. The 
point is just to get something down quickly.
For example, say you have an idea for an editorial cartoon about rising oil 
prices. You want to express the desire for the U.S. to become more reliant 
on domestic fuel sources and less dependent on foreign oil. You realize that 
environmentalists and preservationists are opposed to drilling for oil in 
the U.S. because they fear a natural disaster and possible harm to certain wild-
life. However, you feel that perhaps the risk is worth it in an effort to become 
more energy self-sufficient, and that it would be better for national security.
You know you want to depict an environmentalist in the cartoon and think 
that maybe it would be funny to have one of the animals arguing with the 
environmentalist in favor of drilling in the face of record oil prices. The idea 

73
 Chapter 5: Coming Up with Ideas
is pretty clear in your head, and you just need to get the basic rough sketch 
quickly down on paper. You can jot down a stick figure sketch to remind you 
of the idea later on (see Figure 5-3).
Reviewing the stick figure sketch as a reference at a later date will remind 
you of the idea so that you can develop it into a more elaborate sketch (see 
Figure 5-4).

you remem-

later on.
 
Now you can take the roughed-out sketch and use it to complete the idea as a 
finished cartoon. You can see from Figure 5-5 that I made many choices as to 
layout and placement of the characters, but the basic idea from my original 
stick figure sketch is still there.

Adding Humor to Your Story Lines: 
Good Writing Trumps Bad Art
One of the most fundamental principles in the comics industry is that good 
writing always trumps bad art. Basically, you can spend all the time in the 
world drawing your comics and sketching your characters in all sorts of 
elaborate and wonderful ways, but unless you can come up with innovative 
and fresh ideas, write well, have good comic timing, and have something 
funny to say, you’re bound for the trash heap of history.
The history of cartoons is filled with the carcasses of dead comic strips and 
characters that lived a very short life, died, and were quickly forgotten. The 
primary reason: These comic strips weren’t well-written or funny enough on 
a consistent basis, and even fantastic art can’t save poorly written cartoons.
In comparison, many comic strips that have been around for decades have 
art, backgrounds, and characters that are drawn in a very simple style. 
Yet some of these comics are very successful. Some examples include 
Peanuts, Dilbert, Cathy, and Pearls Before Swine. The commonality among 
these cartoons is that although their art has a simple, minimalist quality, 
they’re all very well-written on a consistent basis.
You don’t want your cartoon to be thrown on the pile of dead comic strips, 
do you? I didn’t think so. The good news is that this section gives you the 
lowdown on incorporating good writing with your interesting characters and 
backgrounds to create a cartoon that people can relate to.

What constitutes a good joke: 
Timing is everything
When writing your cartoons, make sure you use timing to your advantage. 
Comic timing is the use of rhythm and tempo to enhance the humor aspects 
of a joke or story. Ask anyone who practices comedic writing — including 
stand-up comedians and writers of TV monologues and variety sketch 
shows — and they’ll say that the pacing of a joke’s delivery can make or 
break the joke. The same is true for cartoons. 
Writing a good joke is something that takes a lot of practice, so don’t get frus-
trated if you have a difficult time coming up with something humorous. In 
order to keep timing in mind, make sure you apply the following concepts to 
your writing.
Pauses
You take a pause for the purposes of comic timing, often to allow the reader 
time to recognize the joke and react, or to heighten the suspense before 
delivery of the expected punch line. This is manifested in a comic strip by 
the way the cartoonist arranges the panels and how he delivers the script in 
each individual panel.
Pregnant pause
A pause is an effective tool that you can use to disclose subtext or even 
unconscious content — that is, what the character is really thinking about. 
More specifically, a pregnant pause is a technique of comic timing you use to 
accentuate a comedic element, usually involving a character who pauses at 
the end of a phrase to build up anticipation. Pregnant pauses are often used 
at the end of a comically awkward statement or after a seemingly noncomic 
phrase to build up a comeback. An example of a pregnant pause in a stand-up 
comedy act would go something like this:
“Congratulations are in order for George W. Bush. Now that he’s retired 
and has time on his hands, he plans on writing his memoirs . . . ” (pause) 
“but first he needs to find enough crayons to do it.”
You can apply the same thing to a cartoon strip or multipanel editorial cartoon 
by using a blank (wordless) panel for the pregnant pause (see Figure 5-6).

Figure 5-6: 
Correct

timing is

when 
writing your

Setup
A good joke starts with a good setup. The setup is the action or dialogue that 
occurs before the punch line is delivered. One thing you want to avoid is the 
desire to rush through the story line so you can get to the punch line. Part of 
what sells the joke is having a good mental image of the characters involved. 
If they’re established characters that are already familiar to the reader, then 
you can move a little faster.
 
Make sure you write each comic strip to stand on its own so that it doesn’t 
have to rely on a setup from a previous strip. You can’t guarantee that readers 
will have read the previous strip or gag.
Criticism can’t curtail Cathy
One important distinction to make here regard-
ing the “good writing trumps bad art” philoso-
phy is the comic strip Cathy. Cathy has been 
quite successful for over two decades, but it 
has also been the target of much criticism and 
ridicule over the years. Much of the criticism 
has been directed at the artwork and some-
times crude character and design layout.
However, Cathy has remained successful 
because it’s well written in the context of its 
theme of the foibles of modern womanhood. 
Readers, the majority of them women, have 
become huge fans because they can relate to 
the characters and story lines.

 Chapter 5: Coming Up with Ideas
Deciding whether cartoons 
have to be funny
When writing your cartoons, don’t fall into the trap of thinking that every-
thing has to be funny. Cartoons are also very effective when they’re thought-
provoking or poignant. A cartoon doesn’t always have to be roll-in-the-aisles 
funny to be effective.
In determining the tone of the cartoon, you first must determine what you 
want the cartoon to say. If the story line evolves into something on the 
more serious side and the story line is strong and compelling, then perhaps 
being funny may not be appropriate. Editorial cartoons are a prime example 
of comics that are often more serious and poignant than they are funny. 
However, a cartoon can certainly be both witty and serious to make an 
editorial point.
Using loved ones to test your material
When writing story lines and dialogue for your characters, it’s easy to get 
caught up in the work and lose perspective on whether what you’re writing is 
really funny to other people or just your own private inside joke. Having 
someone else take an objective look at your work can be helpful, allowing 
you to see whether you’re going in the right direction. This is especially 
important if you have a particularly warped or unusual sense of humor.
 
So as you’re writing your jokes and text, test your material before sending it 
out into the world. And who better to be your guinea pigs than your nearest 
and dearest — the people who can’t say no — your friends and family! Getting 
a second opinion never hurts, as long as it’s an honest opinion, so tell them 
not to hold back about the positives and negatives of your cartoon.
 
However, be careful not to take what others say too seriously. Criticism is 
healthy, but it can also cause you to lose faith in your own abilities. Take what 
others say with a grain of salt, and make sure you ask more than one person 
for an opinion. If everyone in your writing group, all your friends at work, and 
everyone in your family say it’s bad, maybe you should go back to the drawing 
board. In general, though, you’re the best judge of your own writing.
Your biggest fan will probably be your own mother; after all, that’s her job. 
Her opinion is biased (hopefully in your favor), so don’t use her as your 
only critic!

Taking Action When the Ideas Run Dry
Coming up with fresh, funny ideas isn’t always the easiest thing to do. 
Sometimes you just won’t be able to think of anything new or fresh, and it 
may seem as though the idea well has run dry. But that’s the time to really 
get creative when coming up with new ways of looking at things. This section 
helps you uncover some ideas even after you’re at your wits’ end.
Tying two topics together
One tried and true method in the field of editorial cartooning is known as a 
two-fer-one. Quite simply, this means taking two separate issues and tying 
them together to get one idea (and one cartoon). This method works particu-
larly well when you want to talk about a current event and tie it to another, 
unrelated current event to come up with a new perspective on an idea. 
Using your sketchbook, you can do a series of quick doodles and some word 
association that may help you find something in common between the two 
events (see Figure 5-7).
For example, perhaps you want to comment on the bad state of the economy. 
The news is filled with stories of layoffs, bankruptcies, store closings, and 
house foreclosures. This topic isn’t really funny — it involves a lot of pain for 
a lot of people. How can you add a little humor to this?
Around the same time, say a new Batman movie comes out and is a really big 
hit at the box office. Here’s an opportunity to tie together these two topics 
while they’re fresh in the minds of readers. Now, Batman has nothing to do 
with a bad economy, of course. The topics are totally unrelated. So how can 
you tie the two together?
 
Figure 5-7: 
Quick 
sketches 
and word 
associations 
can help 
you 
combine 
two

topics.
 

79
 Chapter 5: Coming Up with Ideas
Some ideas jump out at you:
 
✓ What if you show Batman filing for unemployment?
 
✓ What if the Batmobile gets repossessed?
 
✓ What if the Batcave gets foreclosed on?
All these ideas could potentially work, and depicting them can be a clever or 
funny way to relate something to readers. I thought it would be really funny 
if I showed Batman sitting up on a building while the night cleaning lady 
sticks her head out in an effort to console him about his recent misfortune 
(see Figure 5-8).
The punch line works because it incorporates Batman’s true identity — that 
of billionaire Bruce Wayne. The fact that the cleaning lady doesn’t know 
his true identity is what makes the cartoon ironic and funny. Misery loves 
company, as they say.

Part I: Drawing Inspiration: Getting Started with Cartoons and Comics 
Thinking outside the box 
versus conventionality
Creating funny ideas often requires that you look outside the box of conven-
tional thinking, which means you have to employ unconventional ways of 
looking at things where conventional thinking may fail.
 
Thinking outside the box has its caveats, however:
 
✓ Unorthodox thinking has recently become so popular that thinking 
inside the box is starting to become more unconventional. Basically, 
what was once new is now old and what was old is now new again.
 
✓ In an effort to come up with something so new and fresh, you risk the 
possibility of being too abstract. If you’re too abstract, you may not 
connect with readers.
For example, many comics on the Web are geared toward certain niche 
audiences, such as people into fantasy gaming. These comics have had 
success on the Web precisely because the Internet is where they can reach 
their specific audience. But many of these niche comics have failed in print 
because typical print readers find the topics and story lines too abstract 
and out of the mainstream.
 
On the other hand, one thing to remember, particularly about comic strips, is 
that conventionality typically works better than nonconventionality. The most 
popular comic strips in the past 30 years have all been conventionally rooted 
in some way:
 
✓ Peanuts is based on childhood and the simple, mundane struggles that 
all kids experience.
 
✓ Baby Blues is based on the experiences of a young couple starting a 
family.
 
✓ Calvin and Hobbes is based on the wonders of childhood imagination, 
which anyone who has ever been a child (as in, everyone) can relate to.
All these comic strips have universal themes that readers can identify with. 
They were all consistently well written, laugh-out-loud funny, and occasionally 
poignant. So in the end, conventionality sells.

Creating Cartoon 
Characters

In this part . . .
C
hoosing characters that you enjoy drawing — and 
don’t mind drawing over and over — is an important 
aspect of cartooning. In this part, I explore some of the 
different types of interesting characters you can create 
and the step-by-step process of creating them, along with 
characters that are out of the ordinary, such as household 
appliances and creatures from outer space! I also cover 
the often tough, dog-eat-dog world of editorial cartoons, 
and I explain how to survive a career that includes 
cartoons that make a political statement.

Chapter 6
Starting from the Top
In This Chapter
▶ Starting with the head
▶ Sketching the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth
▶ Giving expression to your characters
T
he part of your cartoons that readers will most identify with is your 
character’s face. Even the shape of a character’s nose and the placement 
of her ears say a great deal about her personality and way of thinking. In 
other words, facial characteristics express feeling and attitude. Faces give 
your readers insight into your character’s inner being; they’re a nonverbal 
shorthand into your character’s makeup.
Classic cartoon characters have faces much like the people you see on the 
street — in other words, the possibilities are endless! That doesn’t mean 
expressive faces are easy to draw, however. Creating a face requires some 
understanding of how to draw realistic looking eyes, nose, teeth, mouth, 
glasses, hair, and ears.
More important, creating a character with a distinctive face requires that 
you understand how to take all the individual facial elements and put them 
together for a cohesive look; you don’t want a character whose mouth says 
one thing while her eyes say another. When it comes to your character’s 
face, a picture is worth much more than a thousand words! In this chapter, I 
explain every aspect of drawing character facial features that speak volumes 
before your character ever opens her mouth.
Drawing the Head
Chances are that when you begin to create your cartoon character, you start 
with the head. The head is a vital element to character design because it’s 
probably the most frequently drawn part of the character.
When you draw characters in full form, you draw them in a head and body 
shot (for information on how to draw the body, check out Chapter 7). But if 
you have a multipanel comic strip or webcomic and your character has a lot 

84
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
of dialogue in one panel, the only thing you may choose to draw (or have 
room for) is a headshot. So when designing your character’s head, don’t lose 
yours! Choose a head shape that makes a recognizable statement about who 
your character is right from the beginning. The next section explains how.
Creating basic head shapes
Designing a head shape requires a familiarity with basic shapes and how to 
draw them. Though you’ve probably been drawing circles and squares since 
grade school, you may not know how to relate them to certain head shapes 
and the stereotypes associated with each. All you have to do is draw the 
basic head shape and then add the facial features you want to match your 
character’s personality (check out the sections later in this chapter for 
clear directions on drawing eyes, ears, a nose, and so on). This section looks 
at some of these basic head shapes and shows some simple faces that fit 
certain types of characters.
 
You may have noticed that, throughout the entire book, head shapes like 
ovals or circles have both a horizontal and vertical line drawn across them. 
These lines are known as the center guidelines and can help you place the 
facial features in a symmetrical manner. The placement of these lines changes 
depending on the way you position the character and the angle from which 
you draw the head. Center guidelines are important; don’t skip the step of 
sketching them onto your basic head shapes from the beginning.
Round head shape
Round head shapes are often best suited for characters who have small 
bodies. Kids fall into this category — Charlie Brown or the kids from Family 
Circus, for example, have round heads. Other cartoon characters with round 
heads include Mickey Mouse and the Powerpuff Girls. All these characters 
have large, round heads and small bodies. Just draw a circle to start and then 
add the facial features you want to match your character’s personality. 
Figure 6-1 shows an example.
 
Figure 6-1: 
A basic 
round shape 
may be best 
for your 
character.
 

85
 Chapter 6: Starting from the Top
Oval head shape
Another option for your character’s head is an oval shape. You can draw an 
oval shape either tall and elongated or squatty and wide. An oval shape that’s 
elongated can give the impression that your character is really goofy or 
nerdy; a wide oval shape suggests that the character is heavy. Experiment 
with the shapes and positioning of the oval shape and adding the different 
facial details. See Figure 6-2 for an example.
 
Figure 6-2: 
An oval 
shape can 
add a goofy 
quality 
to your 
character.
 
Square head shape
You can also use a simple square to create your cartoon character’s head. A 
square head is best suited for characters that have boxy body types or who 
are big, muscle body types like sports jocks. Sketch the square and then 
draw the facial details to match your character. Figure 6-3 shows an example.
 
Figure 6-3: 
A square 
head shape

character’s 
physical 
strength.
 

86
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Triangle head shape
The last main option you have for drawing heads is the triangle. The triangle 
head has multiple purposes. Like the square shape, the triangle shape is 
well suited for a character who’s large or one who has a big jaw or neck area. 
In contrast, if turned upside down, the triangle can give a character a nerdy 
look. Determine the look you want for your character, draw the triangle, and 
then add the facial features. See Figure 6-4 for an example.
 
Figure 6-4: 
A triangle 
head shape 
can be used 
to create a 
variety of 
character 
types.
 
Exaggerating and distorting the head
One of the great things about cartooning is the ability to stretch and distort 
things in a way that helps give life to the art. You can distort your character’s 
head to convey emotion, expressions, and exaggerated reactions to what’s 
happening around him. If a character is yelling, for example, exaggerating the 
length of the head as the character’s mouth widens and opens can visually 
express to the reader how loud the yelling is.
Figure 6-5 shows an example of a distorted head at rest. A head at rest is one 
that’s not talking or moving around or listening to another character talk, for 
example. However, the head in Figure 6-5 stretches even more, giving the 
impression that the yelling is getting louder. You can draw this in a series of 
panels in a comic for effectiveness.
You can also distort a head to express an exaggerated emotion. Figure 6-6 
shows an angry figure who’s yelling. Notice how distorted the shape of the 
head is. Also notice how the mouth is wide open in exaggerated fashion. The 
head is also leaning slightly forward in an aggressive manner, which gives 
the reader the sense that the character is really upset and screaming loudly.

Placing the features
What determines attractiveness? Personal taste aside, the placement of facial 
features determines our perception of how attractive or ugly someone is. 
Like head shapes, the placement of features can go a long way in conveying 
your character’s mood and image.

88
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
The size and placement of your character’s features depend on the look 
you’re trying to give him. If your character is a strong, superhero type, then 
the features will probably suggest classic Greek features. However, the style 
may be cartoonier, and the placement of the features may be squished and 
exaggerated.
This section looks at two points to consider as you place the facial features 
on your cartoon characters.
The features’ actual location on the head
Unless you’re drawing Martians, you usually place facial features in the 
middle of the head area. The center guidelines can help you place the feature 
correctly. However, the placement of these lines changes depending on the 
angle of the head and the way you position the character.
For example, start with an oval head shape and see how the character 
changes just by moving the features around. In Figure 6-7a, you can see that 
the head looks somewhat normal. By moving the center guidelines down and 
centering the facial features on both the vertical and horizontal lines far 
down on the head, the character takes on a whole new look and feel, as 
shown in Figure 6-7b.The character on the right looks as though he’s looking 
down at you, and the character on the left looks as though he’s looking up at 
you. Notice the change in position of the center guidelines and how the facial 
features reflect this.
You can also draw facial features in different placements from a profile view 
to give your characters a different look. Figure 6-8 shows an example of 
two heads in profile. Moving the facial features far down on the head of the 
character on the left gives him a different look and feel. The character on the 
right looks as though his neck is stretched out as if he’s trying to look over 
something.

Drawing the head from all angles
Drawing a head from different angles is an important element of layout and 
also impacts the way characters visually communicate with one another. For 
example, having a character in the foreground talk with a character drawn in 
the background requires that the character in the foreground turn around 
and face the background character. Visually, you draw the back of the head 
of the characters in the foreground. Figure 6-9 demonstrates an example. In 
this cartoon the character is looking out a window and talking to another 
character standing outside.
Sketching the character’s head from this angle adds visual interest to the 
drawing while allowing the reader to look past the character in the fore-
ground and see the character in the background effectively. It also adds a 
sense of realism, because this is actually what you would see if you were 
standing behind the character with his back to you; it allows the reader to be 
more a part of the cartoon. Small things like drawing the character’s head at 
the correct angle add up to better storytelling. 
The rear view isn’t the only visually interesting variant you can play up in 
your cartoons. You can draw the head, or any object, from many 
different angles. If you were to have someone take a picture of your head 
each time you moved it around a quarter inch to the right, and your head 
was 24 inches around, then they would end up taking 336 pictures. So you 
can see that drawing the head from many different angles can add dimension 
to your cartoon characters. Unfortunately, I don’t have the space to show 
you that many, so I focus on four basic head directions and angles. Focus on 
these four angles and their relationship to the center guidelines.

Figure 6-9: 
The charac-
ter’s head in 
the middle 
foreground 
is shown 
from a 
rear view.
 
Figure 6-10a demonstrates the head from about a three-fourths right rear 
view. Your character may look like this if he were turning and looking back 
toward the right. To draw the head in this angle you need to line up the 
center guidelines so that the vertical line runs down the back of his head 
on the far left, as opposed to running down the front of his head if he were 
facing forward. The horizontal line runs across the middle as shown. From 
this angle you can see only the right side of his glasses from a rear view look-
ing forward. In addition, you can see slightly behind his right ear.
Figure 6-10b shows the character’s head as he faces right in a profile and 
slightly three-fourths view facing forward. From this view you can see both 
sides of his glasses with the center guideline running down the front centered 
between them. The horizontal line runs across and is at eyeglass level.
Figure 6-10c is shown from about a three-fourths left rear view. This angle 
shows the character turning and looking back toward the left. To draw the 
head from this angle you need to line up the center guidelines so that the ver-
tical line runs down the back of his head on the far right and the horizontal 
line runs across the middle as shown.
Figure 6-10d shows the head of the character facing to the left in a profile and 
slightly three-fourths view facing forward. From this view you can see both 
sides of his glasses with the center guideline centered between them and run-
ning down the front left side of the face.

Dotting the Eyes
The eyes are very important to your cartoon characters and play a major role 
in communicating to the reader and the other characters in the strip. The 
eyes are certainly the windows to the soul, but in the cartoon world they 
can also be the window to wackiness! You can draw eyes in a realistic fashion 
and then distort or enlarge them to show emotions like terror or frustration. 
Distorted or exaggerated eyes are a cartooning hallmark. This section walks 
you through how to draw basic eyes and how to distort them for full effect.
Sketching the basic eye
Before you can draw a cartoon eye, make sure you understand how to 
draw a realistic looking eye and all its parts. In this section, I look only at 
drawing an eye in black and white, because adding coloring to eyes is a 
more complicated process. (Check out Chapter 15 for ways to add color to 
your cartoons.)
Follow these steps to draw a realistic looking eye:
 
1. Start with eyelids.
 
 Concentrate on the shape of the lids. Think of the lids as the frame of 
the eye. They frame the entire look. Sketch the eyelid by drawing a 
horizontal line across and another one that curves upwards towards the 
eye socket. See Figure 6-11.

92
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
2. Imagine the eyeball.
 
 Think of the eyeball as a sphere set into and under the lids, but don’t 
draw an actual eyeball. Beginners often make the mistake of drawing the 
eyeball. The eyeball is merely suggested by how you draw the eyelids 
and surrounding elements. 
 
3. Draw the center of the eye.
 
 The center of the eye includes the pupil, iris, and the cornea. To do so, 
draw a thin, dark ring, a colored ring, and a black circle in the middle.
 
4. Add the finishing details.
 
 Draw the tear duct on the corner and the eyelashes. The tear duct is 
very important to the look of a realistic eye, as it represents the sug-
gested corner of the eye.

a basic eye.

Buggin’ out eyes
Saturday morning cartoons we watched as kids wouldn’t be the same without 
someone’s eyes bugging out! This is a trait usually reserved for characters 
who see something they can’t believe they’re seeing, like a ghost or monster, 
or a picture of a really pretty girl. You can see this technique in Bugs Bunny 
cartoons from the 1940s as well as the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoons of 
today. It’s a classic technique and one that’s just plain fun to watch.
 
To draw this effect, you need to exaggerate your character’s facial expression 
so that the mouth is wide open. To draw the bugged-out eyes, draw two oval 
shapes that look like eggs extending out past the face so that they appear to 
be popping out. Bugged-out eyes work best when your character is in profile. 
This allows the reader to see the bugging out effect to its full extent. Figure 
6-12 shows an example of bugged-out eyes.

93
 Chapter 6: Starting from the Top
 
Figure 6-12: 
These eyes 
are really 
buggin’!
 
Wearing glasses
Glasses set the mood of a character and help convey certain things about 
her personality. Classic characters with glasses are usually thought of as 
intelligent, like the class bookworm or nerdy brainiac. 
 
To draw glasses, you simply find the center guidelines and position the 
glasses so that each lens falls on one side of the vertical center guidelines. The 
left lens falls on the left side and the right lens falls on the right side. This is 
true no matter what position the face is in. Always make sure the glasses and 
other features are lined up with the guidelines; doing so ensures the correct 
facial proportion and angle of the head.
Round glasses are usually easiest to draw and look more like wire frames, 
the same kind a bookworm would wear! Figure 6-13 shows an example of 
different sizes and styles of glasses you may want to put on your own cartoon 
characters.

Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Raising an eyebrow
Eyebrows are an important detail that you shouldn’t overlook. Eyebrows can 
help convey a subtle emotion or reaction that readers can easily recognize. 
Using a character’s eyebrows is a great way to make subtle statements 
without having to be too elaborate.
 
To create eyebrows, draw a line above the eye that curves upwards and 
follows the curvature of the eye socket. The bigger the movement upwards 
the more expression the character will have.
Figure 6-14a shows a character who isn’t expressing any emotion with his 
eyebrows. Figure 6-16b shows the same character moving one eyebrow up 
without moving any other facial feature. Doing so effectively conveys to the 
reader that the character is suspicious, surprised, excited, or skeptical about 
something.

Just by a Nose: Sketching the Schnoz
The nose can be a defining characteristic and can say a lot about your charac-
ter. Noses come in all shapes and sizes, and the sky’s the limit when it comes 
to creating the perfect honker. This section gives you the lowdown on drawing 
your character’s nose and the different shapes and sizes you can go with.
Drawing a basic nose
Before you can sketch a nose, you need to know a nose’s parts. The basic 
nose is made up of two distinct parts: 

95
 Chapter 6: Starting from the Top
 
✓ The bridge of the nose (or top)
 
✓ The nostril
To draw a nose, follow these steps:
 
1. Start with the bridge and draw a line down and then a sharp turn 
under to form the basic nose shape.
 
 This shape is generally a 45-degree angle, but it can vary depending on 
how you draw it.
 
2. Move to the nostrils.
 
 When drawing nostrils you can simplify things by curving the bottom 
line of the nose back around so that it forms a small “c” shape. However, 
as shown in Figure 6-15, you can separate the nostril as its own shape. 
You still draw it as if it were a small “c” shape, but at the bottom you 
thicken the line a little bit to give the impression of the nostril opening.
 
Figure 6-15: 
Breaking 
down the 
nose.
 
Considering various sizes and shapes
Like most things in the world of cartooning, you won’t find fast or firm rules 
when it comes to creating a nose. Choosing a shape and size is up to you, 
but the nose should be appropriate to the character and his personality and 
should be in keeping with your own cartooning style. As in the real world, 
nose shapes and sizes are often specific to men and women, the young and 
the old, and the fat and the thin.

96
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Sniffing out the male nose
Males tend to have large noses; the older a man gets, the bigger his nose 
can become, in the real world as well as the cartoon world! To draw a male 
character’s nose, you generally want to follow an angle that’s close to 45 
degrees. Sizes vary, and so does the angle. The older a man gets the less 
sharp his nose becomes in profile and the more rounded it gets. He may also 
have age spots and hair coming out of the large nostrils. Figure 6-16a shows a 
middle-aged man’s nose and Figure 6-16b shows an older man’s nose.
 
Figure 6-16: 
Men’s 
noses 
can vary 
depending 
on age and 
character 
type.

b
Drawing a female nose and a baby’s nose
Female noses are generally smaller and daintier than male noses. They’re 
sharper, and the nostrils are small compared to male characters. You can 
also turn up female noses slightly at the end. To draw a female character’s 
nose, remember that female noses aren’t as big at the base and therefore 
don’t cover as much facial area as a man’s. If you draw a female nose in 
profile, draw it at less than a 45 degree angle.
Meanwhile, a baby’s nose is also different. It’s much smaller than an adult 
nose; that’s why it’s often called a button nose. Children’s noses are under-
developed and have years to go before they grow. When drawing a kid char-
acter, keeping the nose small helps convey to the reader that the character is 
young. Like kids, babies also have a small nose, especially compared to their 
oversized eyes.
Figure 6-17a shows an example of a grandmother’s nose. It’s long and 
pointed, and it’s smaller than a man’s at the base. In contrast, Figure 6-17b 
shows a baby’s nose.

Can You Hear Me? Crafting the Ears
Like noses, ears can tell readers a lot about your cartoon characters. Ears 
can give a specific impression and help define the character’s personality. 
This section gives you a rundown on drawing ears.
 
As with the other facial features like the eyes, nose, and mouth, you also line 
up the ears with the center guidelines. Most of the time you line up the ears 
with the eyes. So if the eyes rest on top of the horizontal guidelines, you gener-
ally center the ears on the same line, especially as viewed in profile.
Drawing the actual ear
When drawing the ear, don’t overlook the inside of the ear. Capturing the 
inside of the ear accurately makes your character’s ears look believable. 
From the outside, the ear is made up of a couple of parts:
 
✓ Pinnas: It forms the outer ear shape with the earlobe at the bottom.
 
✓ Meatus: The inner part of the ear and the ear canal where your eardrum 
is located. 
Figure 6-18 shows an example of a completed left ear with a close-up of the 
inner part of the ear. You draw the right ear the same way, only mirrored and 
in reverse.
 
To draw an ear, follow the question-mark pattern shown in Figure 6-19a. The 
outer ear curves around and is large or even pointed at the top compared to 
the bottom. When drawing the outer ear, you may choose to enlarge the ear-
lobe at the bottom and even have it hang down lower. To draw the inside of 
the ear, draw the S-shape pattern in Figure 6-19b. When drawing the inner 
part of the ear, it’s important to keep some space in between the outer and 
inner ear.

Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Getting the right shape is important, because if you draw the ears incorrectly, 
they won’t look right to the reader. The ear is one of those body parts that can 
be exaggerated but still needs to incorporate basic elements to look right.

Looking at ear shapes and sizes
You can create all kinds of shapes and sizes for ears. When drawing your 
character’s ears, their look and shape can say a lot about the character. Big 
ears make your character look goofy, while pointed ears can make your char-
acter look sinister or even otherworldly, like a vampire — or a Vulcan! Ears 
are a very noticeable feature; if you draw them too big or oddly, they may be 
the dominating feature that readers see. Figure 6-20 shows an assortment of 
ear shapes and sizes for you to consider when drawing your character’s ears.

99
 Chapter 6: Starting from the Top
 
Figure 6-20: 
Now hear 
this: Ears 
can be fun 
to draw.
 
Furthermore, like noses, ears change shape and can grow with age. For 
example, young children tend to have small, round ears that aren’t usually 
their main facial feature. By comparison, an old man has large ears that 
have drooped over the years. Check out Figure 6-21, which shows a child’s 
ear and a grandpa’s ear. Notice how the earlobes on the grandpa character 
are large and hang down, while the kid’s earlobes are smaller and more 
rounded. You can even add some hair in your old man’s ears for extra detail.

with age.

Drawing the Mouth
Your cartoon character’s mouth is a facial feature that you’ll become very 
familiar with, especially if your characters talk a lot. Despite being nothing 
more than a simple line you draw just below the nose, the mouth of your 
character is very important. It can be very expressive and instrumental 
in communicating nonverbal emotion to the reader. Here I show you different 
styles and elements of the mouth for you to consider and study when 
creating a mouth for your own characters.

100
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Crafting the mouth: The how-to
The mouth is one of a character’s most expressive facial features. To draw a 
mouth in various expressions, follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Smiling or smirking: To draw a mouth with a smile, begin by drawing 
a line directly under the nose that curves up gradually on both ends. At 
the corners of each side of the mouth, pull back the laugh lines and con-
nect each side of the mouth to them, as in Figure 6-22a.
 
✓ Sad: To draw a mouth on a sad face, begin by drawing a line directly 
under the nose that curves down on both ends. At the end of each side 
of the mouth, pull back the laugh lines around the corner of the mouth, 
but don’t let them touch, as in Figure 6-22b.
 
✓ Happy: To draw a mouth that’s laughing, begin by drawing a line 
directly under the nose that curves up sharply on both ends. At the cor-
ners of each side of the mouth, pull back the laugh lines past the bottom 
of the nose and connect each side of the mouth to them. The tongue is 
visible, as well as any teeth you may want to add, as in Figure 6-22c.
 
✓ Angry: To draw a mouth that’s angry, begin by drawing a line directly 
under the nose that curves up gradually on both ends and back around 
again, forming a large figure-eight shape. Continue by drawing a horizon-
tal line across the opening for the mouth to display all the teeth, which 
are clenched and visible. Find the center of the mouth and draw a verti-
cal line in the middle. Follow that by drawing smaller vertical lines for 
the rest of the teeth. The laugh lines are pulled back on each side and 
follow closely around each side of the mouth but don’t touch, as in 
Figure 6-22d.
Check out the “Getting All Emotional: Look in the Mirror” section later in this 
chapter for advice on putting the mouth together with the entire face to show 
emotions.

Focusing on all those teeth
A mouth wouldn’t be a mouth without teeth (ask any great white shark and 
he’ll tell you the same). A character’s teeth can say so much: Nice, straight 
teeth give the impression that your character is an upstanding, honest 

101
 Chapter 6: Starting from the Top
person, while crooked or missing teeth can give the impression that your 
character may be a hillbilly or a rough bully type who lost some teeth in a 
fight. And big teeth can give a cartoon character a goofy or wacky look.
 
To draw teeth, utilize the center guideline so that the upper row of two front 
teeth line up in the middle with the center of the face. The left teeth should be 
on the left side of the vertical guideline, and the right teeth should be on the 
right side of the guideline. The top row of teeth is generally larger than the 
bottom, and the width of teeth gets slightly thinner as the teeth move toward 
the corners of the mouth. Figure 6-23 has a variety of styles and shapes of 
teeth for you to consider and study when creating a set for your own charac-
ters. Who knew cartooning and cosmetic dentistry could overlap?!
 
Figure 6-23: 
Don’t forget 
to floss!
 
Adding facial hair
Facial hair is an element that can be character-specific and help define a 
character in a certain stereotype. Facial hair can come in many styles 
and shapes, ranging from full beards to goatees to sideburns. A mustache 
is another element that can change the entire look of a character. To draw 
a mustache or other dominating facial hair, determine how it will affect 
the character’s look.
 
To draw a mustache, begin at the corners of the outer nose, about level with 
each left and right nostril. Draw a line that curves slightly upwards as you 
move out toward the edge of the face. Drop it down so that it’s level with the 
bottom of the earlobe. The lines on each side should evenly fall on each side 
of the nose and also line up accordingly with the center guidelines. Continue 
by drawing two more lines directly centered under the nose that begin and 
follow parallel to each top line outward, meeting at a point on the ends.
Figure 6-24 shows an example of facial hair and how it relates to the charac-
ter. You can see that the mustache makes stereotyping the character easier 
in certain ways — there’s no mistaking what this guy does for a living. The 
outfit and hat are good visual elements that help define this guy, but the 

102
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
choice of mustache really sets the character off and completes his great 
cowboy look and persona. The mustache is a character all by itself!
 
Figure 6-24: 
That’s 
a tough 
lookin’ 
‘stache 
pardner!
 
Figuring out the jaw
The jaw is a great place to help define your character’s look. A weak jaw con-
veys a wimpy personality, while a square, prominent jaw signifies a strong, 
tough character. To draw the jaw, begin a line at the bottom of the mouth 
and curve slightly outward. Angle it sharply back toward the neck. The end of 
the jaw line and the earlobe meet, although you don’t have to show a line 
connecting them unless you want your character to have a really hard, strong 
look. Figure 6-25 shows an example of a weak jaw and a strong jaw. Nerdy 
character types tend to have very weak jaw lines, while superhero characters 
tend to have strong, square, steel jaw lines.

The jaw line

about your 
character.
 

103
 Chapter 6: Starting from the Top
Getting All Emotional: Look in the Mirror
Almost every face you draw has some type of emotion attached to it. Your 
character’s expressions should convey important aspects of the storytelling. 
Nonverbal communication with the reader is important, and certain expres-
sions help the reader understand what the character may be feeling or react-
ing to. The next sections take a look at how different facial expressions 
convey different emotions. You can use these as a guide when drawing your 
own characters.
Mad or angry face
Your characters are bound to get mad or angry sometimes. In fact, one of the 
most common stereotypes in the cartoon world is the wife who’s mad — 
usually with good reason — at her husband. Where the writers come up with 
that, no one will ever know . . . right, guys?
If you want to show your character being mad or angry (check out Figure 6-26), 
incorporate these important facial traits:
 
✓ Eyebrows are turned sharply down.
 
✓ Mouth is open and teeth are exposed like a growling dog.
 
✓ Cheeks are tight and appear to be flexing.
 
✓ Eyes are squinted shut and turned down in the middle.
 
Figure 6-26: 
Who made 
this guy so 
mad?
 

104
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Sad face
Everybody gets sad. Perhaps a little kid character lost her puppy, or maybe 
your character is out of beer or donuts! These are good reasons to get a 
little blue.
If you want to show your character being sad, as in Figure 6-27, incorporate 
these important facial traits:
 
✓ Eyes are drooping and partly closed.
 
✓ Mouth is turned down.
 
✓ Cheeks appear slacked and drooping.
 
✓ Eyes may even have tears coming out of them.
 
Figure 6-27: 
Cheer up, 
it could 
always be 
worse.
 
Happy or laughing face
A happy, smiling, or laughing face is a pleasant face and one your readers 
will enjoy. A smile can be a simple line you draw all the way across your 
character’s face or a short line right under his nose. A smile can be as big and 
wide as you want to make it. However, always make sure it turns up at the 
ends — otherwise it may be a frown!
Happy, smiling, and laughing faces are contagious facial expressions. If you 
want to show your character with a happy or smiling face, as in Figure 6-28, 
remember these important facial traits:

105
 Chapter 6: Starting from the Top
 
✓ Eyes can be wide open with joy or even closed if the character is 
laughing too hard.
 
✓ Mouth is wide and can go from ear to ear, and teeth are exposed.
 
✓ Cheeks are tight and pulled back, and the corners of the mouth run into 
each cheek.
 
✓ Ears are pulled back and may be obstructed by the wide mouth and 
laugh lines.
 
Figure 6-28: 
C’mon, get 
happy!
 
Scared or surprised face
Everybody likes a good scare! A scared or frightened facial expression on 
your character brings a sense of nervous anticipation to readers. When they 
see a dramatically scared expression, they know something spooky is gonna 
happen . . . boo!
To draw your character with a frightened or surprised facial expression (see 
Figure 6-29), incorporate these important facial traits:
 
✓ Eyes are round and may even pop out of the head.
 
✓ Eyebrows are high and arched and may appear to jump off the face, too.
 
✓ Mouth is wide open and tongue is exposed.
 
✓ Hair may stand on end.
 
✓ Cheeks and laugh lines are pulled back far and wide.

Chapter 7
From the Neck Down
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the importance of your character’s body type
▶ Using circles as the basis to draw your character’s body
▶ Drawing arms, hands, and legs
▶ Dressing up your characters
W
hat could be more fun than creating a new body? Not for yourself — 
for your cartoon characters (if only it were so easy to change our own 
bods with the flick of a pen!). Choosing the right body type for your cartoon 
creations defines their character and gives them personality, animates them, 
and conveys action — even when your character is standing still.
 
When sketching out your rough drawings, make your sketches very light. The 
best way to accomplish this is by using a regular pencil and keeping it loose 
and light on the paper. That way you have less to erase after you ink your 
drawing.
 
Consider sketching with a nonphoto blue pencil. The advantage of using a 
nonphoto blue pencil is that your lines won’t reproduce when scanned into a 
computer or when the cartoon is reprinted for publication. (I discuss different 
types of drawing implements in detail in Chapter 3.)
In this chapter, I describe the step-by-step process of drawing a body with 
just the right character.
Giving Your Characters Personality
Your character’s body is an integral part of his personality. His body helps 
define who he is. You can choose to identify your character by giving him a 
stereotyped look — the jolly fat guy, the brainiac little kid — or you can play 
against the stereotypes, creating a muscleman who’s really a big wimp, for 
example. Both realism and whimsy go into making characters that are unique 
but also universal.

108
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
This section gives you an idea of how important a character’s body is in 
showing your reader who the character is and what she’s about. 
Making your characters mirror your style
In cartoons, you can exaggerate and distort body types to create a unique set 
of characters that reflect your own sense of style. However, you also want 
your characters to be believable so that your reader can relate to them and 
find them appealing. If you’re creating a comic strip about an average family, 
for example, it’s important that they all have one head, two arms, two legs, 
ten fingers, and ten toes . . . unless the family lives on Mars.
You may find that the characters and cartoons you draw begin to take on 
certain characteristics that represent your own personal style and input. All 
the faces you draw may begin to have similarities and subtle attributes that 
define them as your characters; just like human offspring, your character off-
spring may be easy to identify as your creation.
Caricaturing your characters
On the other hand, you may not want your cartoon characters to look too 
realistic (although some cartoon strips are drawn in this style, such as the 
old Mary Worth cartoon), because part of the fun of cartooning is the oppor-
tunity to caricature your characters — draw them with realistic but exagger-
ated qualities to give them personal style and flair. It’s a matter of personal 
drawing preference, though; caricature your characters to the degree that 
feels right to you and to the degree that fits each character.
Some characters lend themselves more easily to caricature than others. In 
general, characters whose personality traits fit into an easily recognizable 
type are easy to caricature. The big bully, the brainy nerd, and the jock are 
just a few examples that come to mind; mom, dad, the girl next door, and 
grandma don’t bring to mind the same exaggerated characteristics (although, 
as their creator, you can caricature them to the degree that appeals to you).
Drawing your characters in a caricatured way helps to reveal personality 
traits before they ever open their mouths. For example, if you draw a char-
acter with big, round glasses and a large head, your reader will probably 
assume, without you specifically saying so, that your character is very intel-
ligent. Conversely, giving your character a large torso and upper body and 
smaller legs helps exaggerate not only the character’s physical nature but 
also his personality, making him immediately identifiable to your audience.
For instance, you know instantly that the tough guy in Figure 7-1 isn’t anyone 
to mess with — and he probably isn’t the hero of your cartoon, either!

Building the Body: Drawing the 
Standard Character Type
As you begin to sketch your cartoon character’s body, every decision you 
make conveys a little bit of information. You can express the character’s 
emotions and actions through facial expressions and body language. You 
can convey an amazing degree of animation and information just by the way 
you position your character’s head, by how he holds his arms, or by how he 
bends his legs. For example, a character with a wide neck, large shoulders, 
humongous arms, and tattoos probably isn’t going to be taken for the church 
pastor. Readers will know he’s a tough cookie — especially if he’s sitting on a 
Harley-Davidson!
Drawing a body so that it telegraphs your character’s emotions and actions 
identifies your character’s subtle personality traits and helps you communi-
cate with readers without having to spell out all the details.
 
When you first start drawing figures, always begin with the main area or focus 
of the character — usually the torso — because doing so helps you define the 
rest of your figure. If your character has a big body, drawing the basic torso 
shape first helps you determine the space your character will take up relative 

110
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
to the rest of the drawing. If, on the other hand, your character has a bigger 
head and you’re going to emphasize that area, then focus on the head when 
you start.
After you become more confident in your art skills and familiar with the way 
you want your characters to look, you can begin the drawing process wher-
ever you want. And as you become more proficient, you develop your own 
way of drawing and can skip many of the steps I describe in the following sec-
tions. But if you’re just starting out, follow my basic body-drawing steps.
Starting with circles
If you’re an avid reader or fan of comics, you know that most cartoon figures 
are short and small with a slightly large head. You see this in many classic 
comic strip characters, like Charlie Brown and Snoopy from Peanuts and 
Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes. Most of the modern cartoon characters on TV 
also have this type of body design.
Drawing a classic cartoon body begins with sketching a basic shape, either a 
circle or an oval, and building on it. Classic cartoon characters are often kids, 
and in real life, kids often have disproportionately large heads. In the world 
of comics you always exaggerate the obvious when caricaturing your subject, 
so in this section I show you how to start with a large circle for the head to 
make your character come to life.
Follow these steps to begin your character:
 
1. Sketch a large circle or oval in the middle of your paper.
 
 The circle doesn’t have to be perfectly round — just a rough sketch to 
define the area you want to use as a guideline (see Figure 7-2).
 
Figure 7-2: 
The typical 
cartoon 
character 
drawing 
starts with 
a circle or 
oval.
 

111
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
2. Add a smaller circle or oval below the large circle (see Figure 7-3).
 
 Doing so helps you establish the space for your character’s body.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Many clas-
sic cartoon 
characters 
have heads 
that are 
larger in 
proportion 
to their 
bodies.
 
 
3. Make sure your character’s face is centered in comparison to his body.
 
 Although this character doesn’t look like much yet, you want to improve 
on his physique, center his face, and properly set the stage for his arms 
and legs. To do so, follow these steps:
 
• Draw a vertical line down the middle of the larger circle and 
then draw a horizontal line across the middle. Doing so helps 
you center the face if your character is looking straight ahead (see 
Figure 7-4).
 
Figure 7-4: 
These 
vertical and 
horizontal 
lines can 
help cen-
ter your 
character’s 
facial 
features 
and set 
the stage 
for limb 
placement.
 

112
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
• Draw a vertical line down the center of the smaller circle, and 
then draw a horizontal line across the center of the larger circle 
(as in Figure 7-4).
 
 This helps you place your character’s center of gravity and also 
acts as a guide when it’s time to add arms and legs.
 
 Notice that the center guidelines aren’t exactly centered in the cir-
cles, and they appear to be slightly curved. They should follow the 
curvature of the circumference of the circles, giving the circles a 
more dimensional look and feel, just like a real head and torso.
 
 The key to sketching your drawings is to be loose and not too struc-
tured, because you’re just beginning the process. You just want to get a 
nice feel for the overall character; you don’t have to draw a perfect geo-
metrical shape.
 
4. Draw a square or rectangle where the lower body and legs go, below 
the small circle (see Figure 7-5).
 
 The square space is important because it establishes the area for the 
waist and legs.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Drawing 
a square 
below the 
torso helps 
your leg 
placement.
 
 
5. Draw the legs coming down from the square by sketching two vertical 
lines straight down for each leg.
 
 The legs in this example are really nothing more than a few straight lines 
coming down into the character’s shoes, which are just two small circles 
(see Figure 7-6).
 
6. Lightly pencil in the details (see Figure 7-7).

113
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
Figure 7-6: 
A few lines 
and two 
circles 
become 
your char-
acter’s legs 
and feet/
shoes.
 
 
 Draw light pencil lines to use as a guide so that you have a nice frame to 
ink over with either your pen or brush when you’re ready for more detail. 
Using the center guidelines, start to fill in the face by adding ears, hair, 
and glasses. This guy’s got real big glasses, which helps convey a book-
worm look. For more information about drawing faces, see Chapter 6.
 
Figure 7-7: 
Before 
reaching 
for your pen 
or brush to

more detail.
 
 
7. Add more details and accessories to the character to convey his 
personality (see Figure 7-8).

114
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
 As you work on your character’s face and clothing, small details start 
to bring him to life. You can show your character’s personality without 
having to spell it out for readers. The pencil, calculator, and big glasses 
are good choices for this guy — they give clues about the character’s 
nature. Use your own imagination and creativity and see what you can 
come up with.

ers may

Moving circles for different looks
Although the classic cartoon character typically has a large head and small 
body, you can simply move those basic shapes around and use them as 
the building blocks for a totally new character. The example in this section 
shows you how to move your circles to create the tough guy character I 
show you at the beginning of the chapter — someone with a big, wide chest 
and a small waist.
By changing the position of the circles, you can give your character a new 
look and feel. Just follow these steps:

115
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
1. Sketch a large circle or oval in the middle of your paper.
 
 Again, the circle doesn’t have to be perfectly round — just a rough 
sketch to define the area you want to use as a guideline (see Figure 7-9).
 
2. On top of the large circle, draw a smaller circle.
 
 The angle or direction your character is facing determines where exactly 
the head area should be. For example, if the character is facing straight 
on, then draw the head circle so that it’s centered directly on top of the 
larger torso circle (see Figure 7-10).
 
Figure 7-9: 
The larger 
circle 
represents 
the body in 
the typical 
tough guy.

your 
character

smaller cir-
cle directly

larger one.
 

116
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
3. Ensure that your character’s face is centered with his body.
 
 You want to properly define his face, arms, and legs. To do so, follow 
these steps while referring to Figures 7-11 and 7-12 (and remember, you 
don’t have to be too precise with this drawing):
 
• Draw vertical and horizontal lines across the middle of the 
smaller circle. Doing so helps you center your character’s face.
 
• Draw vertical and horizontal lines across the center of the larger 
circle. This helps you place your character’s arms and legs.
 
 If the character is facing left or right, draw the center guidelines closer 
to the edge of the smaller circle on the side that the character is facing. 
That is, if the character faces left, the guideline should be closest to the 
circle’s left side, and if the character faces right, the guideline should be 
closest to the circle’s right side.
 
Figure 7-11:

body.
 
 
Figure 7-12:

character’s

117
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
 The curvature of the center cross lines gives the figure a slightly three-
dimensional shape, like one of those Bozo punching bags you used to 
get for Christmas as a kid.
 
4. Coming out of both sides of the smaller circle, sketch lines that follow 
the curves of the larger circle (see Figure 7-13).
 
 These lines are the top of the character’s broad shoulders. 
 
Figure 7-13: 
Lines for 
the tough 
guy’s broad 
shoulders.
 
 
5. Add arms.
 
 You can place the arms at the sides of the upper torso to give the tough 
guy an aggressive stance, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
Figure 7-14: 
You can 
place arms 
at different 
angles to 
give your 
character a 
certain look.
 

118
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
6. Box in the area just below the torso and add the legs at the bottom.
 
 The key is to draw the tough guy’s legs small so that the upper body is 
exaggerated (see Figure 7-15). You can see that the size of his arms is in 
proportion to his upper body, but his legs aren’t. Despite this, the legs 
don’t look out of place. However, if you were to draw small arms on a 
large torso, it would look strange.
 
Figure 7-15: 
Drawing the 
legs much 
smaller than 
the arms 
exagger-
ates the 
tough guy’s 
normal 
character-
istics.
 
 
7. Add the feet and shoes by drawing small oval circles at the base of 
the legs.
 
 You can add details like shoelaces to these circles and they quickly 
take shape and become shoes! The tough guy’s feet are small, but not 
too tiny (see Figure 7-16). Their shape and size here reflect my personal 
style. If you think your guy would look better with little girly feet, then 
that’s your decision. 
 
 His shoes are also nondescript in contrast to, say, a detailed tennis 
sneaker. Because the character is top-heavy, putting big, well-defined 
shoes on him would take away from the main focus, which is his upper 
bulk. Most of my characters’ shoes have a similar look and style. I just 
like to draw shoes that way; you can draw yours in whatever style 
suits you.
 
8. Fill in the defining details and add inking to complete the character, 
as shown in Figure 7-17.
 
 This guy’s narrowed eyes, big bulbous nose, and scowl all contribute to 
his tough guy personality. (For more details on how to draw a face, refer 
to Chapter 6.) Don’t forget to define the details on his clothes, like the 
pockets on his pants and his belt line.

119
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
Figure 7-16: 
This tough 
guy’s feet 
are small to 
match his 
legs.
 
 
 At this point, the character’s overall frame and shape is in place, and 
it’s time to finish the art. When you add ink, you follow the loose pencil 
sketch as a guide, and the character really comes alive. Inking requires 
practice, but the results add great line variation to your work and make 
it reproduce well in print. Check out Chapter 4 for more specifics about 
inking your work.

Drafting Arms and Hands
Arms, hands, and fingers vary in shape and size, but the right ones always 
help finish off your character. Arms add to the character’s persona and 
should be appropriately sized for the character’s body type. This section 
shows you how to craft arms, hands, and fingers.

Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Drawing arms
 
When sketching arms, think of them as tubes, or cylinders (see Figure 7-18). 
Although arms are divided into upper and lower sections, with the bend at the 
elbow, cartoon characters typically don’t have overly detailed arms with lots 
of muscle tone and definition. Keeping the arms simple doesn’t distract from 
your overall character design.
 
Figure 7-18: 
Arms start 
out as tubes 
or cylinders 
and should 
fit the char-
acter’s body 
type.
 
When drawing a basic arm for your character, follow these steps:
 
1. Draw a line that starts at the top of the shoulder and comes down 
along the side of the torso.
 
 This line can be straight or curved, depending on how the character is 
standing and what the arm is doing. If the character’s arm is just hanging 
by his side, the line should come straight down and end about waist level. 
 
2. Draw another line the same length next to the first line.
 
 Now your arm has two sides.
 
3. Draw small ovals at the top between the two lines and at the bottom 
between the two lines.
 
 Make sure each side of each oval connects to each line. You’ve created a 
tube or cylinder as a basic guide for your arm, as shown in Figure 7-19a.
 
4. Draw another tube that forms a V-shape, or bent arm, as shown in 
Figure 7-19b.
 
5. For the hand area, sketch out a small, fist-size circle, like in Figure 7-19c.

121
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
6. Using Figure 7-19c as the basic shape for an arm that’s flexing its 
muscle, fill in the details like the fist with thumb and fingers (see 
Figure 7-19d).
 
 If you bunch up your own hand into a fist, you notice details like the 
thumb covering the fingers and the thumbnail being visible while the 
fingernails are tucked away in the fist. The knuckles should be on the 
top of the fist, depending on the direction of the hand. The middle finger 
usually has the biggest knuckle.

tion of the

Lending a hand with fingers
Hand positions can express certain emotions and are part of your character’s 
body language. Unlike the arms and feet of the average character, hands are 
points of interest and can do a lot to communicate to readers.
You can draw hands and fingers in a variety of ways. You may choose the 
more cartoony approach — like the Mickey Mouse style — or a more realistic 
approach. The style you choose is based on what kind of character you want 
to draw. Feel free to add as much detail as you want.
Hands typically flow from the arms and upper torso; if you draw a large 
upper torso and arms, the hands will usually be large, with thick fingers. By 
comparison, if you have a skinny body type with thin arms, the hands will be 
long and lanky, with long, skinny fingers.
Like most things in cartooning, however, no hard and fast rule dictates how 
you design your characters. Use your own imagination and creativity. If a 
huge scary guy with dainty hands and pinky rings fits your story line, or a 
cute little baby with large, grasping hands adds flavor to your cartoon, who’s 
stopping you? 

122
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
You may want a little more detail for your characters. Animators used to 
draw hands on their characters with only three fingers for the simple fact 
that it was faster than drawing them with four!
To draw basic cartoon hands with fingers, do the following:
 
1. Sketch a small circle.
 
2. Add the fingers and thumb corresponding to which way the hand is 
facing, as in Figure 7-20.
 
 If the palm is facing inward, the thumb goes on the inside of the hand, 
toward the body. If the palm is facing outward, the thumb goes on the 
outside of the hand, away from the body. If your character is on the 
heavy side, her fingers should reflect that and be short and stubby. If 
she’s on the thin side, draw long, skinny fingers to be consistent with 
the rest of the body.
 
Figure 7-20: 
Draw your 
character’s 
fingers to be 
consistent 
with her 
body type.
 
A Leg to Stand on: Drawing 
Legs and Feet
Legs carry your character, literally and figuratively. Their positioning con-
veys movement and attitude and helps support the character’s unique 
shape. Many of the characters in this book have a large torso and upper 
body and smaller legs. However, you can create your character with any legs 
you want. Figure 7-21 shows a couple of characters with fat and skinny legs; 
legs should be appropriate to a character’s body type and help exaggerate 
his characteristics.
In this section I give you the lowdown on how to create your character’s legs 
and feet and provide the proper spacing for legs and hips.

123
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
Figure 7-21: 
A charac-
ter’s legs

his overall 
character 
develop-
ment.
 
Starting on the right foot
To draw legs, start by deciding if your character is going to have small legs 
or bulky ones. Remember, classic cartoon characters tend to have simplistic 
body types and body parts. The legs are often very simple in structure, so 
the key is not to overdo it. To draw this type of legs and feet, refer to Figure 
7-22 and follow these steps:
 
Figure 7-22: 
Start your 
legs with 
two straight 
lines and 
then fill in 
the details.
 
 
1. From the bottom of the torso, draw two lines straight down for the 
left leg.

124
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
 The space between the lines determines how thick the leg is.
 
2. From the bottom of the torso, draw two more lines straight down for 
the right leg.
 
 Just like with the first leg, the space between the lines determines how 
thick the leg is.
 
3. At the bottom of each leg draw an oval or circle.
 
 The size of the ovals determines how big the feet or shoes are.
 
4. After you have the general shape in place, add details like shoelaces, 
or the cuff on the bottom of the pants. 
Spacing the legs and hips
How you space your character’s legs and hips depends on the character’s 
body type and stance. Most of the characters I discuss have small legs in 
relation to their body and generally don’t have any discernible hips. Of 
course, when designing and drawing your character, hips may be important, 
especially if you’re drawing a sexy-type character.
To draw your character’s hips:
 
1. On each side of the character’s lower torso, just below the waist, draw 
curved lines that look like parentheses: (   ).
 
2. After you have both sides drawn in, you should have a nice lower 
torso shape (see Figure 7-23). If you desire more curves, simply draw 
the hips in a more curved or cupped fashion. If you’re drawing a com-
plete character, fill in details like a pocket and the character’s knee caps.
 
Figure 7-23: 
Hips are a 
necessary 
addition 
on certain 
character 
types.
 

125
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
Deciding on Dress
Clothes and costumes identify people in the real world, and it’s no differ-
ent in the cartooning universe. Your characters will probably wear clothes, 
unless you’re drawing an adult-oriented cartoon (a bit beyond the scope of 
this book). 
Your character’s clothes need to fit her persona, and almost anything goes in 
the world of cartooning. However, you should follow a fundamental guideline 
so that your characters have a universal appeal and readers understand what 
you’re trying to communicate — and that’s to keep it simple!
Even if you’re drawing animals, nothing’s cuter than putting your crocodile 
or bear in a tutu. Clothes define your characters (see Figure 7-24). For exam-
ple, blue jeans and cowboy boots convey a different type of character from 
silk scarves and ascots. This section helps you select the right clothes and 
accessories for your characters’ personalities.
Choosing shoes
Most of the time, your character’s actual feet 
aren’t visible, unless they’re important for 
making a certain statement. But if your charac-
ter’s feet are visible, make the shoes part of the 
story line. A young character probably wears 
sneakers, and a cowboy probably wears boots, 
but feel free to break the rules and come up 
with incongruous combos like the girl next store 
in Army boots, or a jock in bedroom slippers.
Shoes today are just plain fun to draw because 
they come in so many colors and have all sorts of 
pockets, laces, and assorted gadgetry attached 
to them. Consider observing what modern-day 
sneakers look like to give you some ideas.
Even so, you don’t have to be specific when 
choosing what types of shoes to draw. I usually 
prefer to draw my own form of stylized generic 
shoes, as in the following figure.

126
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Drawing your character’s garb
Clothes are all pretty universal to draw on both men and women characters. 
Both genders wear pants, shoes, and coats. Generally, only women wear 
skirts, unless you’re drawing a kilt, or a dress on that uncle on your mother’s 
side that no one talks about. I briefly discuss drawing pants earlier in the 
chapter when I talk about drawing legs and adding details like pockets. When 
drawing shirts, it’s important to capture the details like the collar.
 
Figure 7-24: 
Determining 
what this 
character 
does for 
a living is 
easy!
 
 
When designing your character’s outfit, make sure it’s not too complicated, 
unless the character is something specific — like a pirate, for example. If he’s 
just the average guy next door, his clothes should reflect that and be simple.
To draw a collar on a shirt, follow these steps:
 
1. Draw a line across the neck area, as shown in Figure 7-25.
 
2. Continue your line down to a point and then back up again so that it’s 
parallel with the top line. The point on the collar is located where the 
bottom meets the front. This should resemble the point you see on your 
own shirt collar. 
 
3. Fill in the small, moon-shaped area in black so that it looks as though 
the collar goes around the back of the neck.

127
 Chapter 7: From the Neck Down
 
Figure 7-25: 
Finish your 
character

like a shirt

4. Draw the collar sticking out on the other side of the neck to add 
balance.
Dressing for the occasion
Clothes make a statement, and they also tell your readers a lot about your 
characters. The clothes can convey where the person comes from, what she 
does for a living, and how old she is. When selecting clothes for your charac-
ters, be consistent and dress the characters correctly for the situation. For 
example, you don’t want to dress your characters loudly or over the top if 
they’re supposed to be a nice, average, middle-class family from the Midwest.
You also want to decide how much emphasis to place on your characters’ 
clothing. The following two sections look at both sides.
Wearing the same thing all the time
Some characters never change their clothes — literally! They wear the same 
outfit every single day. Cartoonists often do this for practical reasons — it 
helps identify the character to the reader. Examples of characters wearing the 
same thing every day include the casts of The Simpsons and Calvin and Hobbes. 
Peanuts has been running consistently in newspapers for almost 60 years, and 
Charlie Brown has never changed his shirt. He must have a closet full of them!
Dressing your characters in the right outfit when you initially design them is 
critical, because that outfit may be the one they wear forever! Branding is impor-
tant; if and when your characters become popular, your readers will expect to 
see them the same way, every day, for the rest of their lives (and yours!).
The outfit you choose to draw your characters in depends on who your char-
acters are. If they’re pirates, they probably won’t be wearing bowling shirts. 

128
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
However, clothing doesn’t have to be too specific. You may choose to dress 
your characters simply so they’re easier to draw. Use your imagination and 
creativity and see what works best for you.
Changing outfits
Although dressing your characters the same way every day is easier, vary-
ing the outfits is more fun — just like it’s more fun to vary your own! Your 
characters won’t complain if you never change their clothes, but you may get 
bored drawing the same outfits every day. Giving your characters a closet 
full of clothes to choose from can be entertaining, and it’s also more realistic. 
Can you imagine wearing the same outfit every day for the rest of your life?
Your characters may wear the same general type of clothes but change them 
with the seasons, the time of day, or even every day, if you like variety. This 
is a matter of personal preference for you, because you’re in charge of your 
characters’ wardrobe.
Adding accessories
You can draw different accessories for your characters to demonstrate dif-
ferent characteristics and to add authenticity. For example, if your character 
works at an office, he probably has to wear a tie.
We explain how to draw a collar on a shirt in the earlier section, “Drawing 
your character’s garb.” Now we tell you how to add a tie (see Figure 7-26).
 
1. Draw a diamond between the two collar points.
 
2. From the bottom of the diamond, draw a straight line down to the 
middle of the belly.
 
3. From the bottom of the diamond, draw another line down that flares 
out like an upside-down cone.
 
4. Draw a line in a V shape at the bottom to connect the two lines.
 
5. Add a crazy tie pattern and you’re done!

▶ Sketching the foremost female body types
▶ Portraying kids
T
he ability to create interesting human characters is one of the most 
enjoyable — and challenging — parts of being a cartoonist. Although the 
possibilities for character development are endless, common cartoon people 
tend to fall into certain stereotypical categories. For example, the all-American 
mom, the forgetful dad, the miserable boss, the smarter-than-all-the-adults 
little kid, and the babies who talk to each other when no adults are around are 
all staples of the cartoon world.
In this chapter, I look at some of the most frequently seen male, female, and 
child inhabitants of the cartoon world and explain how to draw them. Look at 
how I create my cartoon characters and then use your imagination and cre-
ativity to draft your own characters.
Understanding Why Developing a 
Regular Cast of Characters Is Key
Before you can create your cast of characters, you need to know what they 
mean to the viability of your cartoon strip. Typically, the characters in your 
cartoons take the form of people. Although the same people may not appear in 
every strip, many characters appear frequently over the life of a long-running 

130
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
cartoon. The characters need to be consistent so your readers can identify 
with them on a regular basis. If they’re not believable, your readers won’t be 
able to relate to them and, in the end, won’t read your strip.
This section discusses how to get your readers’ attention and hold it by cre-
ating a core group of likable main characters and an interesting supporting 
cast. Remember: After you develop a cast of characters, they may be with 
you for life, so be sure to start out with a group that you can grow with.
Pinpointing the main characters
Most strips have a few central characters that are almost always part of the 
action. These main characters may include a family, a couple, a group of work 
buddies, a talking horse, or the dust bunnies that live under the couch. Your 
main characters are the ones who are on stage the most and are the central 
focus of the strip. (Check out the “Creating Your Core Group” section later in 
this chapter for more specific hands-on direction about developing your cast.)
The possibilities for your main character group are limitless; they can live on 
Mars, at the bottom of the ocean, or in 10,000 BC. Or they can be the people 
next door — average, everyday situations are full of humorous potential. 
Including supporting cast
Most of the time, your core group consists of relatively normal characters 
so that your readers can easily identify with them. Every cast, however, also 
includes supporting characters. The supporting cast includes the characters 
who usually aren’t the main focus of the story line. A good example is the 
next door neighbor who pops in occasionally. Supporting characters offer 
lots of fun chances to create odd or unusual characters, the kind you may not 
see every day but who really spice up the action when they do appear.
Not all the supporting cast will be strange and exotic, however; the group 
may also include grandparents, neighbors, and other normal people who 
drop in from time to time to broaden your story line. When creating your 
core characters, base their supporting cast on characters who interact well 
with the main characters and help support key elements in the story line.
Creating Your Core Group
You may already have a good idea of who your core group of main characters 
is going to be. However, if you’re not really sure where to start with your core 
group of characters, create a group based on what you know best. This isn’t a 

131
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
hard and fast rule; you can create anything you want. But creating something 
based on what you’re familiar with may prove to be a crucial advantage over 
the long haul when you’re trying to write the strip, because you can tap your 
own experiences for ideas. For example, if you’re a father or mother, you may 
draw inspiration from your own kids or even your crazy family dog.
Or you may draw inspiration from your occupation. For instance, Scott 
Adams, the creator of Dilbert, worked for many years in the cubicles of corpo-
rate America before he started his comic strip. He knew the corporate jargon 
and corporate players well, and out of that came Dilbert, which continues in 
over 2,000 publications today.
 
In addition to writing what you know, consider these helpful hints when creat-
ing your core group of characters:
 
✓ Find a personality quirk or trait that’s amusing. If you don’t think 
they’re funny, no one else will, either.
 
✓ Focus on characters you enjoy drawing. You may be drawing them for 
the rest of your life, so create characters and a setting you won’t tire of 
too soon.
 
✓ Base your characters on people you know. Giving your characters 
realistic reactions and behaviors if you know people like them is easier. 
Study your friends and family to see how they act in different situations 
and give similar behavior to your characters, or you can make yourself 
the star of your cartoon world!
The following sections offer specific suggestions to help you get started on 
coming up with your core cast.
Centering on the family
Many cartoon strips focus on the family, because a family allows for a multi-
tude of opportunities for development. Cartoon family members are born, go 
to school, play sports, have pets, get sick, go to work, take vacations, interact 
with one another, and generally live life just like their real-life counterparts. 
So when developing your core group of characters, start with a family. The 
best way to do this is to think about your own family and the funny situations 
they’ve found themselves in, and see what story line possibilities you can 
derive from those situations.
Your family doesn’t have to be a traditional mom, dad, kids, and pets, 
although many are. Creating an atypical family can open more opportuni-
ties for different story lines. For example, a single parent may open the door 
for humorous dating encounters while still supplying material for parent-kid 
interactions. Not every cartoon family has pets, but many do, because pets 
do some very funny (in retrospect, at least!) things.

132
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Keeping your characters consistent
Some cartoonists age their characters over the years, but most of the time, 
characters don’t age. The Simpsons has been on TV for more than 20 years, 
and Bart Simpson is still a 10-year-old kid. Charlie Brown should be retiring 
to Scottsdale by now but doesn’t look a day over 9, and SpongeBob hasn’t 
aged a day!
 
No matter what core group of characters you decide on, you want to ensure 
that you draw the characters consistently. Doing so is important for two 
reasons:
 
✓ Practicality: Having your characters stay the same age makes your job 
of drawing them easier. Characters that stay the same age wear the same 
type of clothing over the years, keep the same hair style, and stay at the 
same weight. As the years go by and you get more and more familiar with 
their shape and design, you’ll be able to draw them in your sleep. 
 
✓ Marketing: When developing and drawing your core characters, you 
also want to keep them consistent for marketing reasons. If you’re con-
stantly changing the look of your characters, readers may have a hard 
time recognizing them. Furthermore, if the style and look of a cartoon 
character is always changing, promotional material like T-shirts or your 
Web site design also needs to frequently change. Doing so can be expen-
sive, especially in the modern world of self-publishing. The best plan is 
to finalize the look and style of your characters before you get serious 
about marketing.
 
 Even when characters change, they do so only slightly to keep their 
brand consistent. For instance, many characters go through what’s 
known as a face-lift, in which characters created long ago are modern-
ized by the current round of artists behind them.
One reason fans fall in love with these characters is because they develop 
a long-term relationship with them that’s based on their personality traits. 
This relationship would be harder to form if the character changed all the 
time. Readers want to know that the characters will always be there for them, 
acting in a predictable way and providing a sense of security, much like the 
blanket gives Linus in Peanuts. And over time you find that you, too, become 
attached to them the way they are, like a favorite old family photo that 
reminds you of your carefree childhood.
Your characters may very well outlive you; Mickey Mouse looks as young 
as the day he was created, and Walt Disney has been pushing up daisies for 
decades. The most important thing is to create characters you enjoy.

133
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
Experimenting with Male Body Types
Most cartoons have a leading male character that readers can relate to. Your 
core characters can be as eclectic as you want them to be, but most cartoons 
are home to certain easily recognized stereotypes. Remember that when I talk 
about stereotypes, I’m talking about personalities and traits that are universal 
and familial to the specific character and not about negative images or ideas.
For example, the father character always yelling at the teenager to mow the 
lawn can be true and funny. This stereotype is pretty universally accepted, 
even though in real life not all fathers yell at their kids. A negative stereotype 
is anything that focuses on things like race, ethnicity, gender, and so on. You 
want to avoid negative stereotypes because they’re historically counterpro-
ductive and play to the lowest common denominator of humor.
 
You draw the body of all these characters in the same way. First you draw the 
basic body and the head, add the arms and hands, create the legs and feet, 
and finally add the accessories that make the character who he is. If you’ve 
never drawn characters before, check out Chapters 6 and 7 first; they show 
you how to sketch the basic face and body. In this section I take a closer look 
at some of the male characters that are standards of cartooning and describe 
how to create the details that make them easily recognizable.
Dear old dad
Dear old dad is the cornerstone of any character cast with the family at the 
core. His body type can be one of many, but the classic body type is best 
described as “the middle-aged guy look.” This guy is perhaps slightly bald-
ing on top and a little wide through the middle. All you have to do is look at 
Homer Simpson, Fred Flintstone, Peter Griffin from Family Guy, or perhaps 
your own dear old dad to see what I mean.
Making your characters young again
One interesting and unusual example of a 
cartoon that aged its characters — and then 
reversed the aging process to recapture what 
was perhaps its golden era — is the comic 
strip For Better or For Worse, written by Lynn 
Johnston. Her core family started as a young 
married couple with small children and aged to 
the point where the kids were married with kids 
of their own. In 2008, Johnston made an unusual 
decision — she rereleased her original strips 
but updated the issues to make the strips more 
relevant to today. Rarely do cartoon characters 
have the opportunity to relive their youth in 
this way!

134
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
The following are a few traits or patterns that dear old dad possesses:
 
✓ A slightly bewildered or zoned-out look: It’s normal for dad to be a 
little overwhelmed by his family!
 
✓ Comfortable, somewhat out-of-date, or classic clothes: Dad’s not a 
fancy dresser.
 
✓ Unstyled hair: If he has any hair at all!
 
✓ The start of middle-aged spread: Dad’s usually middle-aged, so his waist 
is the widest thing on his body.
When drawing dear old dad, keep the preceding traits in mind and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of dad’s body as a large circle, sketch a smaller 
circle above it for the head, and then draw the center guidelines in 
both circles (see Figure 8-1).
 
 Drawing the center guidelines helps you place the center point for dad’s 
facial features and his clothing. Dad faces left with a three-fourths stance, 
so you see the right side of his face and only parts of the left side.
 
Figure 8-1: 
Draw dad by 
starting with 
two circles 
and center 
guidelines.
 

135
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
2. Sketch in dad’s arms and legs by placing the arms on the side of, and 
the legs under, the large circle you drew for the body.
 
 In this pose, dad is facing three-fourths to the left, so draw only his right 
arm and right leg with only part of the left leg showing. Dad’s a middle-
aged guy and slightly stocky or paunchy, so his arms and legs are a little 
on the thick side but not muscular (see Figure 8-2).
 
3. Begin to draw dad’s facial features (see Figure 8-2).
 
Figure 8-2: 
Dad’s 
casual look 
is part of his 
persona.
 
 
 Draw the right side of the glasses with only the left lenses showing just 
over the bridge of the nose. Dad’s nose is a good-sized one but not too 
big. Dad’s mouth is small and located right under the nose. He mumbles 
a lot under his breath, so his mouth is usually closed. His hairstyle is 
nondescript because he doesn’t have time to go to the hair stylist! He 
keeps it cut close to his head, almost military-style, reminiscent of the 
days when he was a cook in the army.
 
4. Dress him in that great out-of-date outfit (see Figure 8-3).
 
 This particular dad dresses pretty casually, and a bowling shirt with 
a loud pattern is his choice of formalwear. Start by sketching in his 
collar and the pocket on his shirt, and then begin drawing the circles 

136
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
that represent the pattern on his shirt. A random series of small and 
medium little circles seems to work best and creates a natural-looking 
texture pattern to his shirt.
 
 Dad likes to wear shorts and tennis shoes while puttering around the 
house. Look at your own tennis shoes so you can see the details and 
logo pattern when you draw a character who wears similar footwear. 
These little details add an extra bit of fun to your characters and make 
them seem all the more real.
 
5. Add a few extra details to complete dad’s loafing-around-the-house 
look.
 
 You can add details like a newspaper (because dad still doesn’t know how 
to use a computer!). Draw a few boxes to indicate photos and some lines 
in columns to indicate text, and the newspaper is ready for dad to read.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Adding the 
details gives 
Dad his 
final look.
 
TV news anchor or used car salesman
The TV news anchor or used car salesman is a staple personality in the car-
toon world. He’s often big, loud, and annoying; nearly everyone can recognize 
this character. You can also make lots of variations within the stereotype; 
he’s often cast as the obnoxious next-door neighbor.

137
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
The TV anchor/salesman is a top-heavy character with a large upper body. 
He starts out with many of the same body-shape characteristics as the “tough 
guy” character that I describe in detail in Chapter 7.
The following are a few traits or patterns that the salesman possesses:
 
✓ A big, phony smile: Feel free to add a gold tooth.
 
✓ Broad shoulders and a slightly overpowering look.
 
✓ Good looks, but in a slightly sleazy way.
 
✓ Clothes that reflect his loud, obnoxious personality, such as plaid 
pants and patterned sports jackets.
When drawing the TV news anchor or used car salesman, keep the preceding 
traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of his body as a large circle, sketch a smaller 
circle above it for the head, and draw the center guidelines in both 
circles (as shown in Figure 8-4).
 
 Drawing the center guidelines helps you place the center point for the 
character’s facial features and his clothing. The salesman faces straight 
on, so he faces you.

shape 
of this 
character 
begins to

Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
2. Square up the large body circle to form a box shape.
 
 This guy has really wide shoulders, and his jacket is slightly boxy-
looking. The box shape becomes his large upper body and jacket.
 
3. Sketch the salesman’s arms on each side of the squared area you just 
drew for the jacket, and then draw the legs coming straight down from 
the bottom of the large square you drew for the jacket.
 
 In this pose, the salesman is facing you straight on. His arms and legs 
are thin compared to the large, square body area, which adds a sense 
of bulkiness and gives the impression that he’s got a pretty wide chest 
under that ugly jacket (see Figure 8-5).
 
Figure 8-5: 
This guy is 
beginning 
to come 
into focus.
 
 
4. Begin to draw the salesman’s facial features, and give him that great 
salesman’s smile that he’s famous for (see Figure 8-6).
 
 The salesman’s glasses are small, and you get a glimpse of his squinty 
stare through the lenses. His nose is wide and straight but not too big. 
He’s got a wide smile, and you can see a few of his teeth through his 
smirky expression. His hairstyle is slicked back and always neat.

139
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
 This particular guy dresses in typical used-car-salesman fashion. Sketch 
in his collar and tie with the pattern of your choice, and if it clashes 
with the jacket, all the better! Then draw lapels on the jacket and but-
tons on the jacket and sleeves. After all the details on the jacket are 
complete, sketch on the plaid or checkered pattern on his coat.
 
 He likes to wear loafers, and his pants are slight high-waters, the kind that 
James Bond used to wear in all those stylish spy movies from the 1960s.
 
5. Give him a few extra details to top off his look.
 
 You can add details like a briefcase, because salesmen of all kinds usually 
carry them, but you don’t have to stop there. After you add some distin-
guishing details, your salesman will be ready for a day on the car lot.

The geek/nerdy guy
Everyone knows the geek/nerdy guy — he’s probably one of the most fun 
characters to draw because he’s so easy to caricature. Unlike some family 
staples, this guy is thin and lanky and uncomfortable with other human 
beings, but he’s probably worth a billion dollars in tech stock.

140
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
The following are a few traits or patterns that the geek possesses:
 
✓ A thin, slightly underfed look.
 
✓ A pale complexion: He hasn’t been out in the sun for years.
 
✓ Thick glasses: He has spent many years reading and squinting at the 
computer screen.
When drawing the geek or nerdy type, keep the preceding traits in mind and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the geek’s body as a long oval, sketch a 
smaller circle above it for the head, and then draw the center guide-
lines in both, as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
Geeks are 
known for 
their lack 
of muscle 
power and 
fashion 
sense.
 
 
 Unlike the previous characters in this chapter, the geek’s torso is a long, 
narrow oval shape because he’s so painfully thin. The geek is looking 
straight ahead, but his body is facing three-fourths to the left. He’s really 
skinny and lanky, and he’s got weak shoulders.
 
2. Square off the top of the oval that will become his shoulder, and then 
draw a line that will be his belt line.

141
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
 You can see that he wears his pants too high and that his belt line is 
just below his chest. Draw the “V” neck line of the vest below his collar. 
Draw vertical lines at each shoulder so that the vest is outlined, and 
then draw a horizontal line just above each elbow to indicate how long 
his shirt sleeves are.
 
3. Draw his skinny legs coming straight down.
 
 In this pose, the geek is three-fourths to the left, but you can still see 
both of his legs, although the left one is slightly hidden behind the right 
one (see Figure 8-8).
 
Figure 8-8: 
A poor hair-
cut, large 
glasses, and 
mismatched 
clothes 
help define 
the geek.
 
 
4. Draw his facial features, as shown in Figure 8-9.
 
 The geek is facing you so you see all his facial features. His glasses are 
large and round, and you can see his beady eyes through the lenses. His 
nose is small and the large glasses make it appear even smaller. His wide 
smile sits high on his face, and the corners of his mouth touch the sides 
of his glasses. His hair is cut short on top and buzzed on the side — 
probably cut by his dad at the kitchen table!
 
5. Add his clothing, as shown in Figure 8-9.

142
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
 This geek dresses in mismatched shirt and pants. Start by sketching his 
’70s-style oversized collar and loud shirt pattern. Add the pocket on his 
vest with the pens sticking out of the top, and add a plaid pattern to his 
high water pants.
 
6. Add a few geeky details to complete his look.
 
 You can finish by adding details like a small pocket calculator and 
papers he uses to do his math homework. You can also add a digital cal-
culator watch, because a geek can never have too many calculators!

is a thin, 
lanky body 
type with

caricature

sories.
 
Trying Different Female Body Types
Most cartoons also have at least one leading female character that readers 
can relate to. Women are no less varied in body types than men are and can 
be equally fun to draw. Just like the male body types, the female body types 
begin with the same basic frame using the same basic circle shapes. If you’ve 
never drawn characters before, check out Chapters 6 and 7 first; they show 
you how to sketch the basic face and body.
This section shows you how to draw some of my favorite females who fre-
quent many comic strips, including the modern mom and the matronly 
grandmother.

143
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
The modern mom
Many family cartoons have the modern mom at the center of the action. 
Today’s modern mom is really the boss of the family. You only have to 
glance at every classic cartoon mom to know who wears the pants in the 
family! The key to capturing the modern mom in your cartoons is to capture 
her unique body type.
The following are a few traits or patterns that the all-American mom possesses:
 
✓ Appealing but not sexy: She has definite mom hips.
 
✓ Perky and happy-looking: Unless she’s yelling at someone!
 
✓ Stylish but modest outfits: She knows how to dress good on a budget.
When drawing the modern mom type, keep the preceding traits in mind and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of mom’s body as a small oval, sketch a smaller 
circle above it for the head, and then draw the center guidelines in 
both, as shown in Figure 8-10.
 
Figure 8-10: 
The shapes 
you use 
to define 
mom’s body 
include a 
hip area.
 

144
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
 The key to drawing mom is to draw a body circle right below the small 
torso oval. This is used for her hip area. The modern mom has a small 
torso but large hips to help define her body shape; the hips come from 
producing all those crazy kids running around her cartoon strip!
 
2. Sketch the mom’s arms and legs.
 
 Begin by sketching her arms, which are thin and are part of her narrow 
shoulders. Next, draw her hips, which are the widest part of her body. 
Then draw her legs, which are wider at the top and then taper down as 
they reach her ankles.
 
 In this pose, her body is facing slightly to the left, which enables you to 
see both legs but a full view of only the right arm. Her left arm holds the 
standard mom-issue gear (see Figure 8-11).
 
Figure 8-11: 
The modern 
mom has an 
appealing, 
but not 
overly sexy, 
appearance.
 
 
3. Draw the mom’s facial features and other details that give her that 
wonderful, modern, motherly look (see Figure 8-12).
 
 She’s facing you, so you see all her facial features. She has big, bright 
eyes that give her a sweet, friendly appearance. She has a small button 
nose that’s straight and even in the middle of her face. She has a 
big, wide smile that runs to the center of each eye. Her hairstyle is a 
medium-style bob cut that goes down near her shoulders.

145
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
 Mom dresses in a sensible, easy-to-wear style. She likes to wear nice 
slip-on loafers without any heel. She usually wears her loafers with 
matching socks or no socks at all.
 
4. Include a few necessary motherly details to complete her look.
 
 Add details like her purse or cellphone. On your own you may want to 
try and create a few more things that a modern mom might be associ-
ated with. Using the basic steps from the previous figures, perhaps you 
can create a little baby. See the “Talking babies” section later in the 
chapter for more details on drawing a baby.
 
Figure 8-12: 
The busy 
modern 
mom is 
a staple 
cartoon 
figure.
 
The matronly grandmother
Grandma is unlikely to be the star of the strip, but she often shows up in 
family cartoons. You’ll know grandma’s here because she’s no fly on the 
wall. Remember that grandma’s other job title is mother-in-law, and they’re 
always fun!

146
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
The following are a few traits or patterns that grandma possesses:
 
✓ A squatty, round body that’s fun to hug.
 
✓ A short, tight hairstyle that’s usually tinted blue.
 
✓ Multilayered clothing like sweaters and long dresses.
When drawing grandma, keep the preceding traits in mind and follow these 
steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of grandma’s body as a large circle, sketch a 
smaller circle above it for the head, and then draw the center guide-
lines in both circles, like in Figure 8-13.
 
Figure 8-13: 
Grandma 
is soft, 
huggable, 
and 
rounded.
 
 
 The center guidelines in both circles help you find the center point so 
you know where to center her face and big smile. Notice that the guide-
lines are closer to the right side of the circle. This is because grandma 
is almost in profile and is facing to the right. But the guidelines still go 
down the center of her face.
 
2. Continue by sketching out grandma’s arms and lower body.

147
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
 Begin by sketching her right arm. Because she’s facing almost entirely 
to the left, you don’t see her left arm. Then sketch the area around 
the body torso circle and make it squared at the bottom for her skirt. 
Squaring it off along the bottom establishes how long her skirt is and 
determines the area where her shoes are.
 
 Next, draw her legs. In this pose both legs are pretty much hidden by 
her long dress, so you see only her mid calves.
 
3. Draw grandma’s facial features and the other details that give her that 
official grandma fashion sense (see Figure 8-14).
 
Figure 8-14: 
Cartoon 
grandma 
dresses 
traditionally 
and con-
servatively 
— and 
she layers 
because 
she’s 
always 
cold!
 
 
 Grandma is facing all the way to the left, so you see the right side of her 
facial features. She has tiny eyes and round, wire-frame glasses. She has 
a large nose in the middle of her face, with a small mouth located right 
under her nose. Her hair is styled in a tight, short perm and is tinted a 
blue shade of gray.
 
 Grandma dresses in multiple layers, including a long-sleeved shirt and 
sweater. She also wears a long dress. You can see a hint of her bosom — 
large and shapeless, for good, squishy hugs! — but it’s covered up by all 
those clothes. She gave up wearing high heels in 1969 and prefers more 
comfortable shoes.

148
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
4. Add a few details to complete her grandma look, as shown in 
Figure 8-15.
 
 Using your own creativity and imagination, you may want to add a few 
details on your own. Perhaps grandma likes a big purse, and of course, 
don’t forget her nervous little dog.
 
Figure 8-15: 
Grandma 
can be a

woman or

charge type.
 
The girl next door
Everyone loves the girl next door, and you can always tell who she is — she’s 
pretty but not seductive, her makeup is understated, and she’s kind to small 
children and animals, not to mention her parents. She’s the all-American 
cheerleader type with a bubbly personality.
The following are a few traits or patterns that the girl next door possesses:

149
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
✓ A cute, casual hairstyle.
 
✓ The looks of an active cheerleader type: She’s thin but looks athletic.
 
✓ Very little makeup: She doesn’t need it!
When drawing the girl next door, keep the preceding traits in mind and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the girl’s body as a small circle for the torso, 
sketch a smaller circle above it for the head, draw another slightly 
larger circle for her midsection/hip area, and then draw the center 
guidelines in all the circles, as shown in Figure 8-16.
 
Figure 8-16: 
The girl next 
door has a 
wholesome 
figure, with 
defined but 
not too 
sexy hips.
 
 
 The key to drawing most young female bodies is a second body circle, 
used for the hip area, drawn right below the small torso circle. The girl 
next door has a small torso but slightly curvy hips to help define her 
body shape.
 
2. Continue by sketching out the girl’s arms and legs (see Figure 8-17).
 
 Her arms are thin and are part of her narrow shoulders. She’s standing 
in a cheerleader-type pose that has her hands clasped and off to her left 
side. Next, draw her hips, which are the widest part of her body (but 

150
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
they’re shapelier and not as wide as other female body types). Then 
draw her legs, which are wider at the top and taper down as they reach 
her ankles.
 
Figure 8-17: 
The girl 
next door is 
stylish and 
trendy, but 
in a tasteful 
way.
 
 
3. Begin to draw the girl’s facial features, including details that empha-
size her wholesome, all-American look (see Figure 8-18).
 
 She’s facing you, so you see all her facial features. She has cute little 
eyes that give her a sweet, friendly appearance. She doesn’t wear a lot of 
makeup, so her eyes look small but still give her that cute look. She has 
a small button nose that’s straight and even in the middle of her face. 
She has a wide jaw and a big, wide smile that runs across her face. Her 
hair is pulled back into two ponytails.
 
 The girl next door wears age-appropriate clothes that are simple but 
trendy and stylish. She likes matching denim skirts and tastefully pat-
terned shirts. Start by sketching her dress straps and long, pullover skirt. 
You can also see a hint of her bosom and the top of her cleavage is visible.
 
 She likes trendy, name brand sneakers with ankle socks that go well with 
her cheerleading outfit.

151
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
4. Finish by adding some details to complete her look.
 
 Add details like her shoelaces and the pattern on her shirt. Don’t forget 
the squiggly line in the middle of her skirt to indicate her leg movement 
and body language.
 
Figure 8-18: 
The girl 
next door is 
sweet, cute, 
and happy 
all the time!
 
Creating Those Crazy Kids
Kids are a cartoon staple; few cartoons don’t have at least one rug rat running 
around creating havoc and confounding the adults. Your kid characters may 
be kids that act like kids, or they may be mini adults, talking infants, or even 
unborn babies! However you design your kid characters, you can be sure that 
anything can happen when kids are part of the cartoon action. This section 
gives you an idea of the types of kids you can include in your cartoons.
Talking babies
You often find babies in cartoons as main characters. Sometimes they grow 
up; other times they remain babies from the day they’re born.

152
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
The following are a few traits or patterns that the baby possesses:
 
✓ A very large head in proportion to body size.
 
✓ Very large eyes and a small nose: He sometimes has no nose at all!
 
✓ A body that’s less defined than the head and face.
When drawing the talking baby character, keep the preceding traits in mind 
and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a large circle for the head and another medium circle below it 
for the body.
 
 Babies’ heads are disproportionate to their bodies, so the head circle 
should be approximately twice as large as the body circle.
 
2. Draw the center guidelines in both circles, as shown in Figure 8-19.
 
Figure 8-19: 
Start your 
baby with 
two circles; 
the head 
circle is 
about twice 
as large as 
the body 
circle.
 
 
 The key to the baby is the large head. (In nature, babies of all species 
have big, fat heads and large eyes; that’s why we find them so darn cute.) 
 
3. Sketch the baby’s arms and legs.
 
 Begin by sketching the arms, which are short and stubby and are part 
of the small round shoulders. The baby is sitting on his bottom, and you 
can see the bottom of his feet. Next, draw two small ovals in the bottom 
left and bottom right of the torso circle, directly over the torso area. 
These are for the baby’s feet.
 
 In this pose, you don’t see the legs fully because of the position of the 
feet. On the top of each small oval, draw five small circles on each foot 
for the toes.

153
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
4. Draw the baby’s facial features, as shown in Figure 8-20.
 
 The baby is facing you, so you see all his facial features. Babies have 
large, round eyes that are disproportionate to the rest of their head. 
This makes them appear cute. The baby has a small button nose cen-
tered between the eyes and located in the middle of the face, and it has 
big, chubby cheeks and a small, cute smile located under the nose.
 
Figure 8-20: 
A baby’s 
face is 
always his 
dominant 
feature.
 
 
 The baby has a striped shirt and diapers on, so sketch out the horizon-
tal stripes across the body.
 
5. Add some details to finalize the baby’s overall look (see Figure 8-21).
 
 This baby has confiscated mom’s cell phone and has his bottle of milk 
handy; feel free to add toys or a cute teddy bear to your baby sketch.
 
Figure 8-21: 
Cartoon 
babies 
have cute 
and cuddly 
accessories.
 

154
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
The little kid
Little kids are always fun characters to draw because they’re so easy to 
caricature, and like babies, they’re appealing and cute. Many of the longest-
running comic strips have kids at their center.
The following are a few traits or patterns that the little kid possesses:
 
✓ Large head: Typically topped with hair that looks like a bird’s nest.
 
✓ Oversized sneakers, with all sorts of colors and fun designs on them.
 
✓ Always wears shorts: Because he’s always on the move.
When drawing the little kid character, keep the preceding traits in mind and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a large circle for the head, which is the main part of the kid’s 
body, sketch a smaller circle below it for the body, and then draw the 
center guidelines in both circles, as shown in Figure 8-22.
 
Figure 8-22: 
Draw your 
kid’s head 
larger than 
his body.
 
 
 Kids’ heads are disproportionate relative to their bodies, so the circle 
for the head should be bigger than the circle for the body. In this case 
the circle for the head appears almost twice as large. This doesn’t have 
to be exact, so you can use your own judgment.
 
2. Sketch the kid’s arms and legs (refer to Figure 8-22).

155
 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
 The arms are short and stubby and are part of the small, round shoul-
ders. The kid is facing you, and you can see the entire body. Next, draw 
a small square below the smaller torso circle; this is the area you use for 
the kid’s waist and pants. Beginning at the bottom of the small square, 
draw the little legs and shoes.
 
3. Begin to draw the kid’s facial features (see Figure 8-23).
 
Figure 8-23: 
A cartoon 
kid is 
somewhat 
disheveled 
looking, 
with a 
cheerful 
grin.
 
 
 The kid is facing you, so you see all his facial features. He has small eyes 
and a small button nose centered between the eyes and located in the 
middle of the face. He’s got a big smile that runs across his face, and he 
has slightly chubby cheeks that are dotted with freckles.
 
4. Dress the kid and add some details to finalize the kid’s look (see 
Figure 8-24).
 
 The kid has a striped shirt and shorts on, so be sure to sketch out the 
horizontal stripes across the body and put pockets on the shorts. Then 
sketch out the details on the shoes. This kid likes to wear the latest 
name brand sneakers. Furthermore, his shoes tend to be bulky and have 
a lot of interesting things going on with them, like colors and stitch pat-
terns. These details are unique to children’s footwear. Sketch out a small 
oval shape and a few small circles for the skateboard, and he’s ready to 
hit the streets.

156
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
Figure 8-24:

head and

The bully
Bullies — they’re generally nobody’s favorite character, but sometimes 
they’re necessary to create action for your other characters. They can also 
be fun to draw because you can make them menacing in a way that would 
never work for your main characters.
The following are a few traits or patterns that the bully possesses:
 
✓ Large head and thick neck.
 
✓ Thick upper body, like a bulldog.
 
✓ A crew cut: Because his dad likes military haircuts.
When drawing the bully character, keep the preceding traits in mind and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a medium circle for the head, which is the main part of the 
bully’s body, sketch a large circle below it for the body, and draw the 
center guidelines in both circles (see Figure 8-25).
 
 Unlike other kid characters, the bully’s head is large, but it’s not out of 
proportion to his body. He has a thick neck and large upper body to give 
him a stocky appearance.
 
2. Sketch the bully’s arms and legs.
 
 The arms are short and stocky but not muscular. The bully’s shoulders 
are really part of his thick neck. Next, draw a small square below the 
smaller torso circle, which is the area you use for the waist and pants. 
The bully has short, stocky legs that are slightly bowlegged.

 Chapter 8: Designing Human Cartoon Characters
 
Figure 8-25: 
The bully’s 
body is 
larger in 
proportion 
to his head 
than the

character.
 
 
3. Draw the bully’s facial features, as shown in Figure 8-26.
 
 The bully has small, beady eyes and a menacing, squinty look on his face. 
He has a big nose that’s located slightly higher on his face than other kid 
characters.
 
Figure 8-26: 
Draw your 
bully with 
small, 
mean-
looking 
eyes and a

4. Dress the bully and add some menacing details to finalize the bully’s 
look (see Figure 8-27).
 
 The bully has a striped shirt and shorts on, so don’t forget to sketch 
out the horizontal stripes across his body and put pockets on the 
shorts. A few crosshatched lines on his shirt indicate that the shirt’s 

158
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
dirty and that he’s been in more than one fight today. Then sketch out 
the details on the shoes. This bully likes to wear the latest name brand 
sneakers, but his parents don’t buy them for him, so he takes them 
from the other kids.

Chapter 9
Giving Inanimate 
Objects Personality
In This Chapter
▶ Exaggerating your characters and backgrounds
▶ Making furniture and appliances stand out
▶ Drawing different types of cartoon cars
▶ Giving inanimate objects a face and a voice
W
hat better way to add depth and personality to your cartoons than to 
include inanimate objects as characters? Face it: A cartoon that con-
tains nothing but people can be kind of dull. The world is so full of interesting 
objects — both man-made and natural — that leaving inanimate objects out 
of your cartoons would be a shame. In fact, inanimate cartoon objects are 
often the stars of the show, as in the movies Cars or Beauty and the Beast, 
where sports cars, teapots, and candlesticks are a big part of the action.
So if you want to give your cartoons an extra bit of life, try to find ways to 
include nonliving beings. This chapter shows you how to draw the objects 
that make up our world and instructs you in the art of animating those inani-
mate objects, should you decide that you want to make a toaster the hero 
of your cartoon universe. You may choose to make people into background 
characters rather than main characters, or, for a different twist, you may 
decide to eliminate people from your cartoons altogether! Even the most 
seemingly mundane inanimate object — like a dishwasher — can come to life 
if you give it the right details. This chapter explains how.

160
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Cartooning Everything, Including 
the Kitchen Sink
In cartooning, as in life in general, the difference is in the details. Adding gad-
gets, contraptions, vehicles, appliances, and nature to your cartoons makes 
them more realistic and more entertaining to look at. Even if objects are just 
part of the background and not part of the action, drawing them realistically 
and a bit humorously puts life into your cartoons, as the next sections show.
Drawing the world around your characters
The environment that your cartoon character inhabits is part of the complete 
cartoon world you create. You want this environment to be recognizable to 
readers, accurate, and most of all, fun.
The setting that surrounds your cartoon characters is kind of like a movie set. 
If you pay attention to the backgrounds in movie scenes, you see everyday 
things like chairs, cars, trees, furniture, and so on. The backgrounds in a 
movie scene are probably no different than the everyday world that you live 
in. If you look around where you’re sitting now, you’d see the same things. 
Depending on the setting, you may see a TV, fireplace, refrigerator, chair, or 
fish tank. Chapter 14 discusses more in-depth how to create the setting for 
your cartoon.
 
Adding small details to your cartoons adds interest to your art and gives the 
scenes a realistic and accurate setting. Depending on your subject, adding 
inanimate objects as characters also gives your cartoons a fresh voice and 
allows readers to look at the world from the viewpoint of something whose 
perspective is quite different than the norm — what would your refrigerator, 
for example, have to say about you?
Caricaturing just about anything
The art of caricature allows you to exaggerate whatever it is you’re draw-
ing. Although it’s not required that you exaggerate your subject matter, I do 
highly recommend it, because exaggerating characteristics adds humor to 
your cartoons and gives them a whimsical look. The gentle stretching or dis-
torting of even the most mundane household item can give it a bit more flair 
and charm.

161
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
When you’re cartooning anything, think in terms of taking a regular picture 
and using Silly Putty on it. You may have done this as a kid. Take Silly Putty 
and press it down over a photograph in a newspaper or magazine. When you 
peel it off of the paper, the image appears on the bottom of the Silly Putty. You 
can stretch and distort the picture into all kinds of fun shapes. As you do this 
the image becomes exaggerated while still being recognizable. This principle 
is the key to the art of caricature.
Having Fun with Household Items
All cartoon characters need a place to live, so what better place to start your 
sketching than with their dwelling! You can find all sorts of great stuff to draw 
and caricature in a house. Depending on your cartoon, these items can be 
interesting background objects, or you can make them actual characters. For 
instance, just picture your cartoon with a toothbrush and toilet brush taking 
center stage! This section takes a look at how to draw a few common house-
hold items.
That comfy ol’ sofa
If you’re drawing a family cartoon, you’ll probably be drawing your char-
acters on the couch eventually. Some characters, like Dagwood in Blondie, 
seem to spend the better part of their day on one.
 
Many cartoon sofas incorporate the following characteristics:
 
✓ Their pattern is loud and plaid or crazy and clashing.
 
✓ They have springs coming out of the bottom of the cushions.
 
✓ They’re overstuffed and comfortable looking.
When drawing a sofa, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a long, three-dimensional rectangle box, as in Figure 9-1.
 
 Drawing the basic box form helps you define the sofa and the space it 
takes up in the room or background. If you’re drawing other objects in 
the room like a chair or an end table, this box will be large in relation to 
the other surrounding objects. (Chapter 12 can help you with putting 
everything into perspective.)

162
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
Figure 9-1: 
Start your 
sofa by

long box.
 
 
2. Sketch in the cushions and arms (see Figure 9-2) on both the left and 
right side of the box frame by drawing the sofa’s arm that is closest to 
you (in my example, you draw the right arm first).
 
 Start by sketching out a small shape about the size of a large loaf of 
bread in which the top and bottom lines are parallel to the top and 
bottom lines of the left side of the large box you draw as a guide.
 
 To draw the cushions, use the figure as a guide and draw two lines in the 
middle of the seating area to divide it up into three cushions. This sofa 
has three large bottom cushions, so the lines you draw dividing them up 
should be parallel to the lines for the arms so that they’re all about the 
same length and going in the same direction.
 
Figure 9-2: 
Add 
arms and 
cushions to 
your sofa.
 

163
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
3. Draw in the key details like the pattern on the entire sofa.
 
 Adding items like patterns, buttons, skirts, or ruffles are ways to per-
sonalize your sofa. A more elegant room may have a striped sofa, while 
a country room may have a ruffled skirt and a flower pattern. In this 
drawing I add a plaid pattern, which is an easy way to decorate the 
sofa. Just make sure both your horizontal lines and vertical lines all 
follow the shape of the sofa. Don’t forget the buttons on the cushions 
(see Figure 9-3). 
 
4. Add extra details to express the type of room your sofa lives in.
 
 To give your couch your own personal look and feel, you can include a 
frilly lace along the bottom of the sofa, add a throw pillow or two, or add 
humorous touches like a spring or stuffing coming out of the cushions. 
And if this sofa belongs to a bunch of bachelors, don’t forget the soda, 
pizza, and beer stains!
 
Figure 9-3: 
Finish off 
the sofa 
with a wild 
fabric 
pattern.
 
The lounge chair
Every household has at least one chair, so look for opportunities to include a 
lounge chair in your cartoon. If dad’s taking up the couch rather than leaning 
back in the easy chair, mom may be sitting there knitting, or it may be used 
as a jungle gym by three or four rug rats!
 
Incorporate these traits when drawing lounge chairs:
 
✓ Their pattern clashes with the other furniture.
 
✓ They recline back for maximum laziness.
 
✓ They’re overstuffed and broken in.

164
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
When drawing a lounge chair, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a square, three-dimensional box, as in Figure 9-4. 
 
 This basic form gives definition to the chair and the space surrounding 
it. For example, if you want a large lounge chair, you can draw the box in 
a slightly squatty shape that’s wider than it is tall. If you want a smaller, 
more formal, upright chair, you may draw the box so that it’s slightly 
taller and narrower. Use this box as a general guide to help you sketch 
out the details for the chair.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Start your 
chair by 
drawing a 
square box.
 
 
2. Sketch in the cushion and add the rounded arms on both the left and 
right side of the box frame. 
 
 To sketch the cushion, begin by drawing the chair’s basic shape. Draw 
the back cushion so that it appears to be leaning back slightly. To add 
the arms, begin by drawing the arm that’s closest to you. The chair in 
Figure 9-5 is positioned so that the right arm is closest to you. The arms 
are about the size of a large loaf of bread and should be parallel to the 
bottom of the chair. Stretching the shape so that the chair is slightly 
wider and a bit more squatty-looking than a real lounge chair gives it a 
cartoony appearance.
 
3. Draw in the fabric pattern and other details, like in Figure 9-6.
 
 Now’s the time to add personal touches like a pillow, a patch on one of 
the cushions, some fancy chair legs, or perhaps a small cat taking a nap.

Animating appliances
You can make appliances amusing just to create a more interesting back-
ground, or you can give them a speaking part in your cartoon world (for 
instructions on drawing talking appliances, see the “Making the toaster talk” 
section later in the chapter).
 
Remember the following when cartooning household appliances:

166
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
✓ They have lots of buttons and switches.
 
✓ They’re often retro-looking, because such appliances are easy to 
caricature.
 
✓ They should look like a specific appliance and not be generic-looking. If 
your goal is to draw a toaster, make sure it looks like a toaster and not 
just a box with a lever on it.
When drawing countertop household appliances, such as a blender and 
toaster, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch two square, three-dimensional boxes — one that’s tall and 
another that’s wide (see Figure 9-7).
 
 The type of appliance you’re drawing determines the overall shape. For 
example, if you draw a microwave, then the shape is more of a horizon-
tal rectangle than the vertical rectangle you would draw for a blender.
 
 Drawing the basic box form helps you define the item and acts as a 
guide as you add details to the drawing, similar to drawing guidelines for 
the facial features when you draw a character. Your initial sketch acts 
as a general guide to help you place the other important elements and 
details necessary to whatever particular object it is you’re drawing. The 
blender has the large cylinder top, and the basic guideline shape should 
reflect this.
 
Figure 9-7: 
All appli-
ances start 
off as a 
square box.
 
 
2. Sketch in the details specific to the particular appliance.
 
 Doing so includes drawing the top lid of the blender and the two openings 
on the top of the toaster. In Figure 9-8, you begin to see that the item on 
the right will be a toaster and that the item on the left will be a blender.

167
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
3. Draw in the key details like buttons and switches.
 
 To sketch the buttons, switches, and other details, go into your kitchen 
and take a look at the appliances you’re drawing. To draw switches and 
buttons, place them on the front of the blender with the adjustment 
knob on the right side and the control buttons on the left. Continue by 
drawing the pop-up lever on the front of the toaster centered in the 
middle of the panel and add knobs on the left and right below it.
 
Figure 9-8: 
Specific 
details help 
identify 
the kind of 
appliance 
you’re 
drawing.
 
 
4. Add any final details to finish off the look (check out Figure 9-9).
 
 Adding a loaf of bread sitting next to a toaster is a nice touch. Using your 
own imagination and creativity, you can add other details to make this 
drawing your own.

Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Calling All Cars
Drawing automobiles can seem complicated because of their large size and 
complex shapes and details. Drawing recognizable vehicles requires practice, 
but the results can add interest and fun to your cartoons. This section gets 
you started drawing a few types of cartoon cars.
The family car
Every family piles into the family cruiser eventually, and in some cartoons, 
the cars are the stars. A car can add dimension and reality to your cartoon, 
either as part of the background or as a character (see “The talking car” sec-
tion later in the chapter).
 
Keep the following in mind when cartooning family cruisers:
 
✓ They often have squatty, exaggerated, funny-looking shapes. 
 
✓ They’re often some kind of SUV or station wagon.
 
✓ They’re more accurately rendered if you study current car models to 
pick up on modern design details.
When drawing the family car, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a large, rectangular, three-dimensional box and a smaller box 
on top to form the area for the roof and windows, as in Figure 9-10.
 
 This basic form helps you define the car and acts as a guide as you add 
details to the drawing. This car is passing you going left, so you see most 
of the driver’s side. Continue by sketching out the area for the front grill 
and headlights and then draw another horizontal line under the grill 
across the front for the top of the front bumper.
 
2. Draw in the area for the wheels (see Figure 9-11).
 
 Sketch the area for the wheels as ovals because of the angle they’ll be 
viewed from. You can see the full view of the wheels on the driver’s side 
but only the bottom of the wheels on the passenger side. Be sure and 
draw a slight, tall, thin oval shape to represent the inside of the wheel 
hubs on the driver’s side.
 
3. Sketch the car’s main details, such as the headlights, bumper, 
antenna, and so on.
 
 To draw the headlights, just fill in two small circles for the headlights 
in the rectangle shape you drew previously. To finish sketching the 
bumper, fill in the rectangle shape in the middle of the bumper for the 
license plate as well as the horizontal lines for the radiator grill.

169
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
Figure 9-10: 
The family 
car starts 
off as a 
large rec-
tangle with 
a box on 
top.
 
 
4. Fill in the inside of the car by drawing the backs of the front seat as 
well as the small rectangle shape for the rear view mirror.
 
 Draw two small square shapes on each side of the car for the rearview 
side mirrors. Keep them level with the top hood of the car and based at 
the bottom of the windshield.
 
Figure 9-11: 
Add the 
circles for 
the wheels 
and it 
begins to 
look like 
a car.
 
 
5. Add the final details to finish off the look while adding motion to the 
moving car, as shown in Figure 9-12.
 
 Cars have all sorts of small details, and it’s important that you get them 
right so the car looks like a car. Adding door handles, mirrors, bumpers, 
and headlights sets the car apart. And don’t forget to add the driver. To 
personalize your car, you can use your own imagination and creativity. 

170
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Perhaps some dice hanging from the rearview mirror? Also, when finaliz-
ing your car, you may want to darken or black out the interior so that 
the car itself stands out better. Adding a drop shadow below the car 
gives the impression that it’s bouncing along down the cartoon highway.
 
Figure 9-12: 
You’re now 
ready to 
take a family 
trip across 
the country!
 
The sports car
Not every cartoon character drives a family road hog; some characters zip 
around in something sportier. If your main character is a middle-aged man 
going through a midlife crisis, or maybe a young, hip California woman, then 
a sports car is the perfect mode of transportation.
 
When drawing sports cars, keep the following characteristics in mind:
 
✓ Their shape is sleek and exaggerated, suggesting a fast car.
 
✓ They should be drawn with a slight forward slant, which gives them the 
appearance of speed.
 
✓ They’re more accurately rendered if you study current car models to 
pick up on modern design details.
When drawing a sports car, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a rectangular, three-dimensional box, and sketch another low-
hung box on top to form the area for the windshield and driver (see 
Figure 9-13).

171
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
 This basic form helps you define the car and acts as a guide as you add 
details to the drawing. Make sure you place the top rectangle for the 
roof line. You want to also sketch in the area for the wheels. The driver’s 
wheels are viewable here, but you see only the bottom half of the wheels 
on the passenger’s side.
 
Figure 9-13: 
A sports car 
begins with 
a rectangu-
lar box and 
a low-hung 
box on top.
 
 
2. Draw in the details for the wheels, as shown in Figure 9-14.
 
 As you finish drawing the wheels, remember to draw smaller circles 
inside the larger ones you drew for the outside edges of the tires. The 
passenger side wheels will be darkened.
 
Figure 9-14: 
Add the 
wheels to 
make the 
drawing 
begin to 
look like a 
sports car.
 

172
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
3. Sketch in other details like the side mirrors, headlights, bumpers, and 
side trim.
 
 Draw two small circles on each side of the car for the side mirrors. 
It’s starting to look sporty! To draw headlights, begin by drawing two 
vertical oval shapes on the front of each front fender. Next draw two 
horizontal lines across the bottom front of the car for the front bumper. 
Fill in the small details like the door handle and side trim as well as the 
antenna, rear view mirror, and handle on the front hood. Drawing every-
thing with a slight, forward slant gives the appearance that the sports 
car is really moving down the road.
 
4. Include a few things that can add motion and movement to the sports 
car (see Figure 9-15).
 
 To give the sports car your own personal look, add details like a funny 
license plate on the front or something hanging off the radio antenna. 
Adding a ground shadow below the car that doesn’t touch the wheels 
gives the appearance that the car is moving quickly.
 
Figure 9-15: 
If you go 
too fast, you 
may get a 
ticket!
 
Truckin’ down the road
Trucks are everywhere in real life, so they show up everywhere in the car-
tooning world, too.
 
Keep these hints in mind when cartooning all types of trucks:
 
✓ Their shapes are boxy and exaggerated for a humorous effect.
 
✓ They’re more interesting to look at if they’re older, retro-style trucks.

173
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
✓ They come in all shapes and sizes, so you should study them closely to 
capture what they actually look like.
When drawing a small truck, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a large, rectangular, three-dimensional box and a smaller 
box on top to form the area for the roof and windows, as shown in 
Figure 9-16.
 
2. Fill in the basic sketch for the wheels with the driver’s side wheels 
fully showing. You can see the basic truck shape begin to take form. 
These shapes define the truck and act as a guide as you add details to 
the drawing.
 
Figure 9-16: 
All trucks 
start off as 
a series of 
boxes.
 
 
3. Draw in the inside details for the wheels (see Figure 9-17).
 
 To draw the wheels, just continue by drawing the inside hub and the 
bottom rear tire tread. You can see the full wheels on the driver’s side 
along with the inside details of the wheel hubs, but only the bottom of 
the wheels on the passenger side. 
 
4. Sketch in other details like the headlights, bumpers, and side trim.
 
 To draw the taillights, draw two small vertical shapes at the rear on 
each side of the tailgate. Trucks have all sorts of great details like door 
handles, big side mirrors, big rear bumpers, and a gas cap.

174
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
Figure 9-17: 
Your truck 
is almost 
ready to 
haul that 
ugly sofa off 
to the dump!
 
 
5. Add any final details to finish off the look of this old truck, as shown 
in Figure 9-18.
 
 Don’t hold back — you can really give your truck its unique look. Try 
adding an air horn on top or a flag attached to the radio antenna. Use 
your own imagination and creativity and see what you can come up 
with. Don’t forget that adding a shadow below the truck shows that it’s 
really bouncing down the road.
 
Figure 9-18: 
Having the 
wheels

 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
Putting a Face on an Inanimate Object
The great thing about the world of cartooning is that you can give personality 
to anything. The key is to add human characteristics to objects, including the 
way the object moves and how you make the object express itself. You can 
humanize any object by giving it eyes, ears, and a big mouth. By humanizing 
inanimate objects, you can create offbeat and unique cartoon characters to 
give your comic a life of its own. The next sections look at a few examples of 
how to draw and humanize inanimate objects.
The talking car
In cartooning, you can take anything — such as a car — and make a talking 
character out of it. For example, Disney’s very popular movie Cars took car 
models from all around the world and turned them into talking characters 
that acted and interacted just like people. The cars all had facial features and 
expressions created by incorporating the headlights and grill into a face.
 
Remember the following when cartooning talking cars:
 
✓ They have exaggerated movements that mirror human movements.
 
✓ Their facial expressions and features are incorporated into the existing 
car design.
 
✓ They have a friendly, cute look that gives them human appeal.
When drawing a talking car, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a large, rectangular, three-dimensional box (see Figure 9-19).
 
 This basic form helps define the talking car and acts as a guide as you 
add details and definition.
 
2. Sketch in more details like the area for the roof and the driver’s front 
wheel, as shown in Figure 9-20.
 
 To draw the roof line, sketch a smaller square area on top so that it’s 
centered between the two fenders. Next sketch the driver’s wheel on the 
side of the driver’s front fender by drawing a small circle on the charac-
ter’s right side. You can see the basic car shape begin to take form.

177
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
3. Draw in the area for the wheels, as shown in Figure 9-21.
 
 To do so, draw the three small half circles under the car. Don’t worry 
about detail under the car; it will be blacked out. You can see that the 
driver’s front wheel is in a more flexible position than a normal car 
wheel — more like an arm or leg you’d see on a human or animal 
character.
 
Figure 9-21: 
The wheels 
are sub-
stitutes for 
arms and 
legs for the 
talking car 
character.
 
 
4. Add the facial features that substitute for the headlights and radiator 
grill, as shown in Figure 9-22.
 
 To do so, draw the front grill as a large smile and the headlights as eyes. 
This really gives this guy personality! You can see that the front of the 
car has big, wide, friendly facial features using the car’s existing parts 
and design. Add side mirrors, the interior roof line, and seat outline that 
will be blacked out.
 
To make your talking auto your own creation, add details like a funny front 
license plate or a missing tooth in the car’s smile.

The final car 
looks like

character!
 
Making the toaster talk
Cars aren’t the only inanimate object you can bring to talking life in the world 
of cartooning. You can give appliances a speaking part in your cartoon uni-
verse, too — like the toaster in this section.
 
Keep the following in mind when cartooning appliance characters:
 
✓ Their faces are made up of buttons and switches.
 
✓ They’re more amusing if their shape is stretched or squished.
 
✓ They’re more appealing if you give them human characteristics.
When drawing a talking toaster, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a square, wide, three-dimensional box, as shown in Figure 9-23.
 
 Drawing the box helps you define the item and acts as a guide as you 
add character details.

179
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
 
Figure 9-23: 
Creating a 
character

appliance

a square 
box.
 
 
2. Sketch in the facial details for the appliance character (see Figure 9-24).
 
 Draw in the front button details like the pop-up lever that will be his 
nose. Use the center pop-up lever as a guide and locate the eyes on each 
side of the lever. Draw a smile that’s centered directly under the pop-up 
lever and curved up on the ends.
 
Figure 9-24: 
The talking 
toaster 
begins to 
come to life.
 

180
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
3. Add any final details to finish off the talking toaster look, as in 
Figure 9-25.
 
 Adding things like toast popping out the top and a dancing stick of 
butter next to the talking toaster makes for a delicious trio! Draw the 
accessories next to the toaster and have them moving outward to 
convey movement and action.
 
Figure 9-25: 
Now you 
have some-
one to talk 
to every 
morning at 
breakfast!
 
 
You can choose to further personalize this guy by adding other items to the 
drawing like a talking loaf of bread or a blender buddy.
Smiling sunshine
One classic cartoon character that regularly pops up in children’s cartoon 
shows, children’s books, and animated movies is the big yellow sun with the 
smiling face. This is a prime example of a nonhuman object brought to life.
 
Incorporate the following when cartooning a big yellow sun:
 
✓ Big smiling face
 
✓ Round shape with lots of sun beams
 
✓ A wise personality

181
 Chapter 9: Giving Inanimate Objects Personality
When drawing the big yellow sun, follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a nice, round circle, like in Figure 9-26.
 
 By drawing the basic round circle, you define the area of the sun charac-
ter. The circle acts as a guide when you add details. Draw the horizontal 
and vertical guidelines so that you can center the facial features.
 
2. Sketch in the sunbeams (see Figure 9-27). 
 
 To do so, begin by drawing the U-shaped sunbeams around the sun so 
that they’re evenly positioned around the sun but don’t touch it. You 
can begin to see the circle look more like the sun. 
 
Figure 9-26: 
The warm, 
friendly 
sun begins 
with a nice, 
round circle.
 
 
3. Draw in the key details for the big smiling face (see Figure 9-28).
 
 Adding wide eyes and a toothy grin gives the sun a warm, appealing 
personality. He’s wearing sunglasses because it’s just so bright outside! 
Sketch in the glasses by centering them on each side of the center 
guidelines.
 
4. Add a friend like a cute little star or cloud. 
 
 To draw additional celestial objects, start by drawing a star or two. Feel 
free to add as many clouds or stars as you want to keep the sun com-
pany. As you do, be sure and give them all happy faces to create a big, 
friendly universe!

Exploring Anthropomorphism: 
Creating Animals and Other 
Creatures That Talk
In This Chapter
▶ Adding pets to your cartoon world
▶ Including other animals in your comic strips
▶ Putting out-of-this-world characters in your cartoons
C
artoons don’t have to be realistic, so anyone and anything can be part of 
your cartoon world. Humans aren’t the only characters you find in car-
toons; animals are very popular cartoon characters. Although dogs and other 
household pets predominate in family cartoons, any type of animal can be a 
supporting character — or even the main character — in a comic strip. Some 
cartoon strips consist only of animals, with no human characters to be found.
You can also find unearthly creations — such as robots, spacemen, and 
droids — in some cartoon strips, and they can be as human in their behavior 
as the guy down the street. If you want to add talking animals, robots, and 
other nonhuman living beings to your cartoons, then you’ve come to the 
right place. In this chapter, I look at the wealth of characters found outside 
the human race, and I show you how to bring them to life.
Pets Are People, Too! Drawing 
Classic Cartoon Animals
Like their real-life counterparts, many cartoon families have at least one pet. 
The pet is often a dog, but it can just as easily be a cat, fish, or gerbil. You’re 
limited only by your imagination when it comes to introducing animals into 
your cartoon families.

184
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
If you prefer, you can make animals the only characters in your cartoon, like 
the comic strip Pogo does. In such cartoons, your animals can conform to 
stereotypes — the mean rat, the kingly lion, the sneaky snake, and so forth — 
or you can cast them against type, like Disney did by making the rat the hero 
of the animated film Ratatouille. This section shows you how to create and 
draw some typical cartoon animals, including the details that help your 
characters come to life.
The family dog
The family dog character is a staple in the cartoon world, common to many 
popular comic strips throughout history. These cartoon canines usually 
come off as smarter than their human counterparts, often forgetting that 
they’re dogs! Perhaps the most famous family dog is Snoopy, from the classic 
comic strip Peanuts. Snoopy is instantly recognizable and has been a favorite 
for many generations.
The following are a few traits of man’s best friend, the family dog:
 
✓ Has a short cartoon body usually dressed only in a birthday suit
 
✓ Is smarter than his owner — but in a lovable way
 
✓ Displays human characteristics such as standing on two legs or eating 
with his hands
 
✓ Possesses the ability to speak — but his owner may not understand him!
When drawing the family dog, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the dog’s body as a circle, draw a slightly 
smaller circle above it for the head, and then add center guidelines in 
both circles, as shown in Figure 10-1.
 
 Drawing the center guidelines (for all your characters) helps you place 
the center point for your dog’s facial features. The dog’s body faces 
straight on, and his head is at about a three-quarter view.
 
2. Sketch in the dog’s arms and legs by placing the arms on the side and 
the legs under the large circle you draw for the body, as in Figure 10-1.
 
 To do so, start the arms at the top of the shoulders. In this pose, the 
dog is facing straight on, so draw his arms and legs fully showing on the 
right and left side of his torso.
 
3. Draw the dog’s facial features, including a great canine smile and a 
black, diamond-shaped nose.

185
 Chapter 10: Exploring Anthropomorphism
 
 To add these features, use the center guidelines so that the placement of 
the features is symmetrical. Place the eyes evenly on either side of the 
center guideline. Center the nose and mouth so they’re balanced with 
each side of the face. This dog has a beaming smile and a slightly 
mischievous look (see Figure 10-2).

4. Add finishing details that are specific to this canine creature.
 
 Darken his ears and fill in the area for his nose so that they’re both black. 
Add small little dots under the nose to give the impression that he has 
small whiskers.
 
5. Personalize your drawing.
 
 Get your dog ready for a day of loafing around the house. You can add 
extra details like his collar, bowl, newspaper, bone, and so on, as shown 
in Figure 10-3. Use your own imagination and creativity to see what you 
can come up with to make this character your own.

That darn cat
Your cartoon family may have a cat in addition to or instead of a dog. Or per-
haps the little old lady down the street has a couple of cats to keep her com-
pany. Because cats have more attitude than dogs, they can add spice and an 
edge to your cartoon world. Two examples are Garfield and Heathcliff.
Here are a few traits common to the family cat:
 
✓ Has a short, furry body
 
✓ Boasts a wisecracking attitude
 
✓ Displays human characteristics such as the ability to talk or use a can 
opener
 
✓ Is much smarter than his owner, although his owner often doesn’t see it!
When drawing a cartoon cat, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the frisky feline’s body as a large circle, 
sketch a smaller circle above it for the head, and then draw the center 
guidelines in both circles, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
 This cat has a nice, wide midsection, so don’t be afraid to go big on the 
belly!
 
2. Sketch the cat’s arms on each side of the wide torso area, and sketch 
the legs.
 
 To do so, begin by sketching out the arms so that they’re in the position 
shown in Figure 10-4. The cat’s left arm is holding something, so it’s 
in the upright position. Draw the legs beginning at the bottom of the 
middle torso and straight down with the feet so that they point out in 
each direction, one to the left and one to the right.
 
 Like the dog, the cat wears only her own fur, so you won’t put any 
clothes on her. In this pose, the cat is facing you straight-on. Her arms 
and legs are short and stocky compared to the large, round body area. 
This adds a sense of bulkiness and gives the impression that she has a 
pretty wide belly under all that fur.
 
3. Begin to draw the cat’s facial features, and give her a sly feline smirk 
(refer to Figure 10-5).
 
 The cat’s eyes are large and her nose is wide and shaped like an 
upside-down diamond. She has a wide smile, and you can see a few 
of her teeth through her sardonic expression. Her hair and whiskers 
protrude on each side of her face.

4. Draw some toys for the cat to play with, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
 Cats get bored easily, so don’t forget to give her a few toys. I like to add 
details like a ball of string or a mouse as her companion . . . or snack!

Pet goldfish
You may think a goldfish is a boring cartoon character, but think of all that 
can be seen through the glass of a fishbowl placed in the busiest room in the 
house! Goldfish can interact with other animal family members or can just 
observe through their distorted glass walls.
The following are a few traits of the pet goldfish:
 
✓ Has a round, wet-looking body
 
✓ Has a friendly look and smile
 
✓ Displays other human characteristics such as the ability to talk and 
strong powers of observation about his human keepers
When drawing the family goldfish, keep those traits in mind and follow these 
steps:

190
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
1. Sketch the main part of the goldfish body as a large circle, and then 
draw the center guidelines, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
Figure 10-7: 
Your gold-
fish sketch 
starts with a 
large circle 
and adds 
the begin-
nings of the 
fish’s fins.
 
 
2. Sketch the fish’s fins along the bottom and on the tail, and square off 
the edges (refer to Figure 10-7).
 
 To draw the fins, sketch two diamond shapes located directly under the 
torso area. In this stance, the fish is facing to the left, and you only see 
his right side fin with a hint of the left fin behind the belly. Next, from 
the top of the torso, draw a shape that looks like an orange slice stand-
ing on end. This is the top fin. For the back tail fin draw a half crescent 
shape and attach it to the body just above and just below the center 
guideline.
 
3. Draw the fish’s facial features, including a smile and a happy expres-
sion (see Figure 10-8).
 
 The fish has a very large mouth, and the curve of the mouth goes all the 
way back until it runs into his gills, which are two vertical lines on the 
side of his head. Because he’s facing to the left, you see his full left eye 
and about half of his right eye. His left eye is especially large and domi-
nates his face and body.
 
4. Add a few extra details (see Figure 10-9).
 
 Using your own creativity and imagination, add details on your own. 
Perhaps you may add authenticity to his fishbowl, such as a fake castle 
and some glass chips. And don’t forget the bubbles that indicate he’s 
under water — he’s ready for a day of swimming.

The World Is a Zoo
The cartoon animal world extends far beyond dogs, cats, and goldfish. Family 
pets aren’t the only animals in comic strips — any animal, insect, or creature 
from your imagination can be the star of the show. If drawing common house-
hold pets isn’t your thing, branch out into other animal cartoon characters.
Certain well-known stereotypes can be a big part of your cartoon humor, 
such as the elephant that never forgets anything. You can also play against 
that stereotype, though, with an elephant that forgets everything! Donkeys 
can represent liberal politicians or, well, themselves, like the donkey in the 
Shrek cartoons. In this section, I show you how to draw some of the animals 
populating the zoo.

Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Puts his neck out for others: The giraffe
Giraffes are often sketched as intelligent yet playful — think Geoffrey, the 
giraffe who personifies the Toys “R” Us chain. If you want to be creative, you 
can make your main character’s best friend a giraffe — your story options 
will be endless.
Here are a few traits common to the cartoon giraffe:
 
✓ Has a long neck and lanky body that may be clothed in a stylish outfit
 
✓ May wear bifocals
 
✓ Possesses human characteristics such as the ability to talk or drive a car
When drawing the giraffe, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the giraffes’s body as a large circle, sketch a 
long, narrow oval for the neck with a small circle on top for the head, 
and then draw the center guidelines, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
 This debonair giraffe is sitting in a chair reading the paper. Sketch out the 
square area in front of him for the newspaper. For the chair, start at the 
base of his long neck and draw an upside down “L” shape that slightly 
curves down following the torso area. Draw the armrest by drawing a 
shape about the size of a loaf of bread, and on the right end of that shape 
draw a line down and several across to finish off the bottom of the chair.
 
2. Sketch the giraffe’s long, lanky arms on each side, and draw the legs 
coming straight out from the bottom of the same area.
 
 Start with the legs because they’re the most visible in this scene. Follow 
the example in Figure 10-11 and draw a line from the bottom of the torso 
so that it moves upward to form the top of his leg and then down for his 
shin. The top should look like a small peak; this will be his knee. In this 
pose, the giraffe is sitting with his legs crossed and is facing slightly to the 
right. You can’t see much of his arms because one is by his side and the 
other is behind the newspaper. You can see his fingers as they hold the 
top of the paper. Draw three small horizontal oval shapes for his fingers.
 
3. Draw the giraffe’s facial features.
 
 He’s wearing glasses that give him an intelligent look (refer to Figure 
10-11). His glasses are small, and you get a glimpse of his squinty stare 
through the lenses. His snout is long, and his nose is way out on the end 
of it. He has two ears that point straight out, as well as two horn-type 
things (called ossicones) on the top of his head. Use the center guide-
lines and center both eyes and the bridge of the nose so that they’re 
symmetrical as you look at his face straight on.
 
4. Personalize your character by adding a few extra details (see Figure 
10-12).

 Include details like a pattern on the chair and some lines and boxes on 
the newspaper to help finish off your sketch. Don’t forget to give him a 
nice jacket and tie (he’s quite formal and dignified) and put a nice collar 
on his plaid shirt. Wing-tipped black-and-white shoes are a nice touch!

Acts like the tough guy: Mr. Rhino
Rhinos aren’t quite as humorous or funny as other animals, but they possess 
a certain charm, as well as the strength to be the leader of the animal pack! 
Your cartoon rhino may be a stern sidekick, or perhaps a mean coworker.
Here are a few traits common to the rhino:
 
✓ Has a big, bulky body
 
✓ Possesses a tough guy attitude
 
✓ Shows the fun side of his personality by wearing amusing ties
When drawing the rhino, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the rhino’s body as a large circle, sketch 
another large circle above it for the head, and then draw the center 
guidelines in both circles (check out Figure 10-13).

195
 Chapter 10: Exploring Anthropomorphism
 
 The rhino body is large and dominates the scene, so the center guide-
lines also help the placement of the head as well as the legs placed on 
each side of the line. His left arm will be holding a dumbbell and is in a 
curled position.
 
Figure 10-13: 
A rhino 
can be an 
offbeat 
character to 
add to your 
repertoire.
 
 
2. Sketch the rhino’s arms on each side of his body, and draw the legs 
coming straight down into his shoes (see Figure 10-14).
 
 Add laces on the shoes as well as the top line for his socks, which come 
up above his ankles. In this pose, the rhino is facing left, so you see his 
right side but only a hint of his left side. His arms and legs are broad and 
burly and ready to burst out of his shirt.
 
3. Draw the rhino’s head and face (refer to Figure 10-14).
 
 The head and face are large and top-heavy. This rhino has glasses, small 
eyes, and a huge snout with large nostrils and a big horn pointing straight 
up. He’s got a relatively small mouth compared to the rest of his head.
 
4. Add some personality to the rhino by drawing accessories and details 
(see Figure 10-15).
 
 The rhino’s a tough guy of the animal kingdom, but he still likes to 
express his personality with his outfits. Add details like a shirt and funny 
shorts. Put something in his hand like a dumbbell, hammer, or ax.

 Chapter 10: Exploring Anthropomorphism
They Came from Outer Space
One of the great things about being a cartoonist is the ability to take liber-
ties with reality and create your own interpretation of the world around 
you. This is especially true when creating unique and out-of-this-world 
characters — literally and figuratively — so you may want to include 
aliens, robots, and other creatures in your cartoons. Because nobody has 
ever seen an alien (unless you believe the UFO conspiracists), your aliens 
can have any look you want them to have — one eye and antennae aren’t 
required! This section walks you through the different steps on drawing 
these extraterrestrials.
Beaming down aliens
Not all aliens are little green men, but they can be if you want them to be. 
Designing a totally new life form can be fun as well as challenging. Aliens are 
associated with certain stereotypes, but you’re free to experiment and give 
your alien whatever appearance and personality quirks you desire.
The following are a few common traits of the cartoon alien:
 
✓ Has spindly arms and legs covered with a one-piece, futuristic outfit
 
✓ Has a large head with big eyes
 
✓ May “speak” telepathically
When drawing an alien, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the alien’s head as a large circle, and then 
draw the center guidelines, as shown in Figure 10-16.
 
2. Sketch the alien’s tentacle body coming out from the bottom of the 
space helmet (see Figure 10-17).
 
 In this pose, the alien is facing you. It has a long body that looks like one 
single tentacle from an octopus. Using Figure 10-17 as a reference, begin 
by drawing two lines starting from the top of the head area and going 
down parallel to each other. Curve both lines in an up and down fashion 
and have the ends meet at a point. The finished shape should look like 
it’s squirming.

198
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
3. Draw the alien’s face, which is large and round like a balloon and is 
enclosed in the big round helmet.
 
 The alien is facing you so you see its one large eyeball. 
 
Figure 10-16: 
Whatever 
it is, it’s not 
human!
 
 
4. Sketch some extra details (see Figure 10-18).
 
 Add other details like the spots on the alien’s head and the bottom scale 
lines on its tentacle. Use your own imagination and creativity and add 
other details like a spaceship in the background.

Cyborgs and droids
If you’re a fan of science fiction, you know that cyborgs are a cross between 
a human and a machine, and the result is always one twisted looking life-
form! You can include some cyborgs and other droids in your cartoons for a 
unique mix. Imagine a human falling in love with a cyborg and all the fun you 
can have with that story line.
The following are a few traits of the cartoon cyborg:
 
✓ Is a mixture of human and machine; mix up the parts any way you like
 
✓ Can perform inhuman feats because of its part-robot makeup
 
✓ Is usually one of the villains in the universe set on conquering the world, 
so a mean look is essential
When drawing a cyborg, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the cyborg’s body as a circle, sketch a larger 
circle above it for the head, and then draw the center guidelines in 
both circles (see Figure 10-19).
 
2. Sketch the cyborg’s arms and legs coming out from its torso (see 
Figure 10-20).
 
 In this pose, the cyborg is walking to the left and the arms and legs are 
moving in a stride manner. The left leg is in a full stride outwards while 
the left arm is holding a ray gun.

3. Draw the cyborg’s head and facial features (refer to Figure 10-20).
 
 The cyborg is a mixture of human and machine, so you want to draw it 
with a variety of fun gadgets and machinery. Its helmet is covering its 
entire head, and it has mechanical vision goggles. To draw the goggles, 
begin by placing them in the center of the helmet along the horizontal 
guideline. Finish by drawing the end ear cap devices on each end. Because 
it’s facing left, you only see the right ear device. On top of the helmet draw 
an antenna on each side of the vertical guideline.
 
Figure 10-20: 
Take me to 
your leader!
 

201
 Chapter 10: Exploring Anthropomorphism
 
4. Finish the cyborg by adding tubes and wires all over its body (see 
Figure 10-21).
 
 Add other details like body armor and a jet pack. Personalize your 
cyborg as you choose and make it your own creation.

looking

Classic robots
From the classic science fiction of the 1950s on through to the last Star Wars 
movies, robots have been an integral part of popular culture. Just like aliens, 
you can draw and include robots in your cartoons in a hundred different 
ways, and they’re always a blast to create!
Here are a few traits common to the cartoon robot:
 
✓ Has a boxy body and head
 
✓ Always senses danger before humans do
 
✓ Sports a lot of flashing lights and gadgets on its chest
When drawing a robot, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the robot’s torso as a square box and sketch 
a circle on top for its head, and then draw the center guidelines (see 
Figure 10-22).

202
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
Figure 10-22:

2. Sketch the robot’s arms and legs coming out from the sides of its body 
(see Figure 10-23).
 
 In this pose, the robot is standing facing to the left, and the arms and 
legs are flexible like an accordion. You see only the right arm com-
pletely; the left arm is protruding out from its side.
 
3. Draw the robot’s facial gadgetry (see Figure 10-23).
 
 Sketch out the robot so you see all its face plate buttons and gadgets 
and flashing lights on its breast plate. It has a rotating laser for an eye 
and a slit for a mouth.
 
4. Finish the robot with a few extra accessories like clamps for hands 
and a satellite dish on top (see Figure 10-24).
 
 Add other details like the bolts and screws to hold the robot together.

Pogo: Politics in a swamp
Pogo followed the misadventures of a group 
of creatures living in the Okefenokee Swamp. 
Pogo himself was a possum, and his best friend 
Albert was an alligator. A mainstay of Pogo was 
the lampooning of political figures as fellow 
swamp creatures. Contemporary figures of the 
day like Richard Nixon, Spiro Agnew, J. Edgar 
Hoover, and George Wallace all made their 
appearances. As a result of the strip’s politi-
cal undertones Walt Kelly, creator of the Pogo 
comic strip, was often censured. He took con-
siderable heat for lampooning Senator Joseph 
McCarthy, as well as for depicting Russian 
leader Nikita Khrushchev as a pig and Cuban 
leader Fidel Castro as a cigar-chomping goat 
uttering pro-Marxist rhetoric. 
Walt Kelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
in 1913. As a young man, he worked for Walt 
Disney as a storyboard artist on animated shorts. 
Later, he graduated to such full-length feature 
films as Dumbo and Fantasia. While illustrating 
army manuals during World War II, Kelly devel-
oped his most famous character, Pogo, who first 
saw print in 1943 in a comic book. Pogo didn’t 
debut in newspapers until 1948.
After Kelly’s death in 1973, his widow contin-
ued the strip with the help of various assistants 
until the summer of 1975. Another attempt to 
revive the strip was launched in 1989 but failed 
shortly thereafter. But Pogo lives on in book 
collections and retrospectives of the original 
strips.
The strip had an unrivaled influence on so 
many cartoonists, including Garry Trudeau 
(Doonesbury), Berkeley Breathed (Bloom 
County), Jeff MacNelly (Shoe), and Bill 
Watterson (Calvin and Hobbes).

Chapter 11
Drafting Editorial 
Cartoon Characters
In This Chapter
▶ Grasping the role of editorial cartoonists
▶ Coming up with ideas and getting them across to readers
▶ Sketching realistic and iconic characters
E
ditorial cartoons (also known as political cartoons) exist to make a point, 
and often a very barbed point at that. Although editorial cartoons may 
also amuse or entertain, their primary purpose is to create social or political 
commentary that simplifies the subtle and often complex underlying issues 
of a news story.
Editorial cartoons dissect the issue and break it down into its simplest form 
using visual metaphors to represent the cartoonist’s opinion. So you don’t 
think anyone will listen to your political views? Express them in cartoon form 
and more people will take a look because of the visual appeal of cartoons.
In this chapter, I discuss all the aspects of political cartooning, from carica-
turing public figures to dealing with public criticism.
Defining Editorial Cartoons
An editorial cartoon can address any issue, be it political or social. But it 
must make a statement or take a stand on an issue or it’s not an editorial car-
toon. Editorial cartoons can be any of the following:
 
✓ Funny: Humor can give an editorial cartoon an extra punch, but only if 
the humor still allows the real issue to be understood.

206
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
 
✓ Poignant: Cartoons that use powerful images that evoke emotion. The 
memorial cartoons that followed the tragic events of September 11th are 
good examples.
 
✓ Critical: Editorial cartoons can seem mean-spirited or even vicious if 
you’re the subject of the cartoon or a supporter of the subject. However, 
if you agree with the cartoonist’s portrayal, you see his work as right on 
target. It simply depends on what side of the issue you happen to fall.
Thomas Nast: The father of American caricature
Historians refer to Thomas Nast as the “Father 
of American caricature.” He’s also regarded 
as the first American political cartoonist who 
started a rich, colorful trend that continues 
today. Nast laid the groundwork for not only 
editorial cartooning but also criticism and 
satire in all its current modern forms. His legacy 
continues in cartoons, late-night monologues, 
comedy sketches, TV opinion programs, and 
any other form of social critique.
Nast’s drawing talents were apparent from very 
early on. In 1855, at the age of 15, he started 
working as a draftsman for a newspaper, 
and within three years he landed at Harper’s 
Weekly.
Nast quickly became famous for his work and 
subsequently became a national celebrity. 
Perhaps the series of cartoons Nast is most 
famous for is the work he did depicting Boss 
Tweed, a powerful New York politician who 
used corruption as a method of operation. 
Nast’s drawings were instrumental in the down-
fall of Tweed and his corrupt operation. Tweed 
was so concerned about Nast’s drawings 
that he even attempted to bribe Nast with over 
a half million dollars — a vast fortune in the late 
19th century.
Nast rejected Tweed’s offer and instead con-
tinued the attack with his pen. Tweed was 
arrested in 1873 and convicted of fraud, among 
other charges. Tweed escaped in 1875 and 
eventually fled to Spain. Ironically, Spanish offi-
cials were able to identify Tweed the fugitive by 
using one of Nast’s cartoons.
Additionally, Nast is credited with creating 
the symbols for both major American political 
parties. After President Andrew Jackson used 
the term “jackass” to criticize the Democratic 
Party, Nast began using a donkey in his car-
toons as the symbol for Democrats. Nast was 
also responsible for creating the Republican 
Party elephant. In an early cartoon, he drew a 
donkey clothed in lion’s skin, scaring away all 
the animals at the zoo. One of those animals, the 
elephant, was labeled “The Republican Vote.” 
That’s all it took for the elephant to become 
associated with the Republican Party.
He also popularized the image of Uncle 
Sam and created the modern image of Santa 
Claus — the one often seen in classic ads for 
the soft drink Coca-Cola.

207
 Chapter 11: Drafting Editorial Cartoon Characters
Editorial cartoons can be diverse, but most follow certain traditional styles. 
In modern political cartooning, two styles have emerged:
 
✓ The traditional style: This style involves the use of visual metaphors and 
stereotypes. Many cartoonists use visual metaphors and caricatures to 
explain complicated political situations, and thus sum up current events 
with a humorous or emotional picture. These cartoonists generally were 
influenced stylistically by Mad magazine. Their purpose is to bring across 
a message to people and try to make them think a certain way.
 
✓ The alternative style: Also referred to as the altie style, this style pro-
vides more of a linear read than usually seen in comic strip format. Altie 
style is typically more text-heavy and less reliant on visual gags than the 
traditional style.
Refer to the “Setting the Scene for What You Have to Say” section later in this 
chapter for more on these two styles.
Both are legitimate ways to convey a message; the traditional forms of edito-
rial cartooning rely more on the art to tell the story and convey the message 
than the wordier, text-heavy, alternative formats do.
 
If you don’t want to end up being caricatured in an editorial cartoon, don’t run 
for office!
Understanding the Pen’s Strength: 
What an Editorial Cartoonist Does
“The pen is mightier than the sword” is a phrase from a play coined by 
19th-century British playwright Edwards Bulwer-Lytton. This quote sums up 
the nature and power of editorial cartoons better than just about anything 
ever said, except for the well-known phrase, “A picture is worth a thousand 
words.” Editorial cartoons exemplify both these statements; together they 
define the long tradition of biting satire and social commentary that makes 
up the blood and guts of editorial cartooning.
To be an editorial cartoonist, you have to be able to express your opinion, 
which means that you have to have opinions and be willing to expose them 
to a sometimes less than adoring public. 

208
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
To be an editorial cartoonist and express your opinion, you follow this daily 
routine to come up with your cartoon:
 
1. Search for newsworthy hot topics.
 
 People don’t read cartoons that discuss things they have no interest 
in. In today’s 24-hour news environment, a new story is always being 
reported. As a result, there are many stories and topics from which to 
obtain subject matter. Check out the next section for more hands-on 
advice about finding ideas.
 
2. Form an opinion about an issue.
 
 It helps if you actually have opinions before becoming a political car-
toonist, because people will look to your cartoons for a particular slant.
 
3. Draw a cartoon that illustrates how you feel about that issue.
 
 Every issue or news story has a story behind the story. A good editorial 
cartoonist will try and say something about what’s really going on under 
the surface of an issue, to make the reader think or look differently at an 
issue or situation, like peeling back the layers of an onion.
 
One thing that an editorial doesn’t do is report the news. That task is left up to 
the reporters and news gathering organizations. The cartoonist’s job, by com-
parison, is to comment about the story. A cartoonist is a political and social 
commentator.
The rest of this chapter breaks down how you can discover ideas, create 
opinions, and then draw a cartoon to show that opinion.
Finding Ideas and Forming an Opinion
The first step to creating an editorial cartoon is coming up with an idea. 
Being a news junkie is almost a prerequisite to being a good editorial cartoon-
ist. To form your ideas, you have to regularly read and listen to the news. 
Finding ideas isn’t overly difficult because of the influx of news sources on 
TV, in print, and online. Just keep these simple steps in mind as you formu-
late your ideas and come up with your opinion:
 
1. Tune into a wide variety of news outlets and look for an interesting 
news story.
 
 Doing so gives you the most comprehensive and thorough amount of 
information about a story. When searching for ideas, you can look at a 
wide assortment of sources, including the following:

209
 Chapter 11: Drafting Editorial Cartoon Characters
 
• TV: You can look at the network news outlets like ABC, NBC, CBS, 
and FOX. In addition, you have local news affiliates as well as cable 
news networks, such as CNN and MSNBC.
 
• Radio: Listen to the plethora of radio news, including National 
Public Radio.
 
• Web sites: Countless sites are available, including Slate and the 
Drudge Report. You can also check out different blogs for ideas. 
Newspapers’ Web sites are also great sources.
 
• Newspapers and news magazines: If you like to have the actual 
newsprint in your hands, several newspapers and news magazines 
are great sources, including the New York Times, Washington Post, 
Newsweek, and Time.
 
2. After you have a good handle on the facts of the story, digest that 
information and create your opinion for a possible cartoon angle.
 
 Opinions are usually the result of a gut reaction to an issue. However, 
it’s important that you become as well-informed as possible on an issue 
so that your opinion is based on all the available information and not 
just what you may hear on a TV news sound bite. After you feel you have 
all the information about the issue, ask yourself how you feel about it.
 
 This sounds a lot more complicated than it actually is. Everybody in 
the course of going about their daily lives hears bits and pieces of news 
throughout the day. Chances are you hear these stories and form some 
kind of opinion in your head. Then you meet your fellow coworkers at the 
water cooler as they’re talking about the very same story. By this time 
you have some idea about how you feel about the issue and express it to 
them. Editorial cartoonists do the same thing, except they express their 
feelings through their drawings (and, hopefully, get paid for them!).
 
3. Jot down the ideas on paper as quickly as possible. The most common 
and perhaps the best way to do this is to always have a notebook handy 
so that you can jot down ideas and rough sketches. You may discover 
over time that coming up with ideas is easy if you stay tuned into what’s 
going on in the news.
Setting the Scene for What 
You Have to Say
Editorial cartoons are powerful forms of communication, but they’re not 
without their methods and formulas. You need to familiarize yourself with 
some common elements of these cartoons in order to get your point across 
effectively. This section gives you a leg up on the more traditional methods 
as well as the alternative route.

210
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
Grasping the art of visual metaphors
One of the primary functions of an editorial cartoon is to make a strong point 
to the reader. One of the best ways to accomplish this is known as visual short-
hand or the use of metaphors to get the point across. Metaphors are compari-
sons that show how two things that aren’t alike in most ways are similar in one 
important way. Editorial cartoonists use metaphors to make their cartoons 
more interesting and entertaining. To use a metaphor, you need to find one 
visual scenario and apply it to another in an effort to make a broader point.
Figure 11-1 shows a classic example of how you can use a visual metaphor 
to convey the message. The economic crisis of 2009 has President Obama 
promising to enact another round of stimulus to help the economy. Great 
news, right? Well, the downside (and it’s a biggie) is that the U.S. will have to 
borrow the money to fund the stimulus, which Obama says will be in the form 
of tax cuts. Basically, that’s feeding the growing national debt. Bingo. That last 
line is all a good editorial cartoonist needs to cultivate an idea. So you have to 
find some visual metaphor to express the idea of feeding the national debt.
 
Figure 11-1: 
Depicting 
the growing 
U.S. debt 
as a hungry 
lion is an 
example 
of a visual 
metaphor.
 
In this figure you have Obama feeding the debt, literally. The debt could have 
been drawn using a variety of animals or creatures to convey a hungry beast 
(a hungry lion in my interpretation). Drawing the stimulus as a big cut of 
meat naturally made sense from a visual metaphor viewpoint.

211
 Chapter 11: Drafting Editorial Cartoon Characters
Using stereotypes to convey your message
Just like visual metaphors, stereotypes are another commonly used artistic 
tool often employed in editorial cartoons. A stereotype is a conventional and 
oversimplified conception, opinion, or image based on the assumption that 
members of a certain group have attributes in common. Stereotypes are 
forms of social consensus rather than individual judgments.
 
People usually view stereotypes in a negative light, so make sure you avoid 
certain stereotypes, such as those that target sensitive historical topics like 
race. You also want to avoid stereotypes about topics that instigate prejudice 
and false assumptions about entire groups of people, including members of 
different ethnic groups, religious orders, or sexual orientation.
Editorial cartoons do try to invoke generally nonoffensive stereotypes to 
make a greater, broader point about an issue. You may want to draw all your 
politicians and representatives as big fat guys who gorge on taxpayer money. 
The reality is that the politicians don’t really do that, at least not literally. 
However, readers can relate to that characterization and stereotype because 
that’s the way the politicians are sometimes perceived. Some additional ste-
reotypes commonly used in recent editorial cartoons are:
 
✓ Drawing oil companies as fat cats
 
✓ Drawing lawyers as sharks
 
✓ Drawing terrorists as rats
 
One distinction that must be made is how and when to use a stereotype in a 
cartoon. For example, it’s okay to stereotype terrorists as rats. It’s a pretty 
safe generalization that all terrorists hate the U.S. and want to kill everybody 
who lives here. However, a bad stereotype would be to portray all Muslims 
negatively just because some terrorists are Muslims. The cartoonist should 
always use discretion when employing stereotypes so as not to distract or 
overshadow the point he’s trying to make.
Letting the art make your point
The advantage to letting the art tell the story is that there’s something 
powerful about a single, stand-alone image that conveys to the reader what 
you’re trying to say. You want the art to deliver the message and act as the 
visual punch line. This simply follows the idea that “a picture is worth a thou-
sand words.” As a cartoonist you want to take advantage of a medium that 
allows the art to do the talking.

212
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
One of the most famous examples of art making a point followed the assas-
sination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The next day, a 
cartoon appeared in newspapers across the country by legendary cartoonist 
Bill Mauldin showing the statue of Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial with his 
face in his hands, mourning in anguish at the news of JFK’s tragic death.
The image was powerful and contained no text. People who saw it instantly 
knew what it was saying as it so accurately conveyed the somber feelings and 
sentiment of the American people.
Going the altie route
Alternative cartoons typically are more text-heavy and rely less on the art to 
convey a message. This format utilizes more dialogue that tends to be more 
cerebral in nature. The practitioners of this modern interpretation of edito-
rial cartooning seem to be more influenced by literature than the traditional 
cartoonists who derive their style from a long line of succession that dates 
back to Mad magazine.
Alternative cartoons usually follow a multipanel format with lots of dialogue, 
and the art in some cases is no more than talking heads. This format can be 
extremely effective if it contains dialogue that’s well-written and makes a 
strong point.
Drafting Believable Caricatures
One of the most powerful tools an editorial cartoonist has at her disposal is 
the art of caricature. A caricature is a drawing that exaggerates the fundamen-
tal nature and essence of a person to create an easily recognizable likeness. 
Caricatures in editorial cartoons are usually viewed as less than flattering but 
generally serve a greater purpose in the larger context of the cartoon.
Politicians are great targets of caricatures. You can exploit and integrate 
the politician’s weaknesses into your caricature. For example, even though 
former President George W. Bush was over 6 feet tall, many editorial cartoon-
ists drew him as a small figure, with diminished height (as in Figure 11-2). 
This reflected his diminished popularity toward the end of his second term 
in office.
In order to draft believable caricatures, you need to study the facial character-
istics and body language of the politician in question. This section examines 
several current politicians and leaders and teaches you how to caricature 
them using not only their facial features but also their body language and 
personality traits.

Knowing how to capture a likeness
To capture the likeness of someone famous while caricaturing him is to pick 
up on key elements of his face and exaggerate them. When caricaturing some-
one’s likeness, you want to study the following:
 
✓ Natural characteristics of the subject: Focus on features like eyes, ears, 
nose, and so on, because these are areas that are most recognizable to 
the reader. George W. Bush has a thin upper lip, and the space between 
his upper lip and nose is longer than most. Cartoonists exaggerated this 
in his caricatures while still allowing him to be recognizable.
 
✓ Acquired characteristics: Identify things like moles, scars, facial lines, 
and so on, because these unique features can help establish who the 
person is right away.
 
✓ The person’s vanities: Focus on features like hairstyle, glasses, clothing, 
and facial expressions. When you have to draw the entire person and 
not just the face, playing up the mannerisms and body language add 
another important aspect and dimension to the caricature.
 
✓ Other key elements: You want to pick up anything else to emphasize 
and exaggerate in the caricature drawing.

214
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
You can see an example of characterization by taking former President 
George W. Bush as an example. If you study his face, you see that he has a 
slightly larger space between the bottom of his nose and his top lip. Notice 
also that his eyes are small and slightly close together. Next, notice his hair-
style. You can see these things reflected in his caricature (see Figure 11-3).
 
Figure 11-3:

basic key 
elements in 
his actual

Drawing a president: The how-to
Ushering in a new administration and newly elected president means edito-
rial cartoonists must forget the guy who occupied the office for the last four 
years and move on to the new guy. The new guy today is Barack Obama, and 
he’s got an interesting face. I take a look and break it down to show how you 
can successfully caricature it.
You can easily identify the following unique to Obama’s face:
 
✓ Long and narrow facial structure
 
✓ High cheekbones
 
✓ Wide smile that shows lots of teeth
 
✓ Prominent laugh lines on each side of his face and around his mouth
 
✓ Large, round ears
 
✓ Short, cropped haircut
When drawing President Obama’s face, keep those traits in mind and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Sketch a long, large oval and draw the center guidelines in a vertical 
and horizontal direction, as in Figure 11-4.

215
 Chapter 11: Drafting Editorial Cartoon Characters
 
Figure 11-4: 
President 
Obama’s 
face is long 
and narrow.
 
 
 Obama has a long lean face; the guidelines help you properly center and 
position his facial features.
 
2. Sketch in the area for his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.
 
 To draw his mouth and nose, draw a line under the center horizontal 
guideline for the nose. Next draw another line under that one that spans 
the width of his face and that slightly curve downwards at the ends. 
President Obama has a great big smile that shows lots of teeth. Obama 
also has deep, prominent laugh lines that almost touch the sides of his 
face when he smiles. To draw his eyes, draw two small lines on each 
side of the vertical guideline. His eyes are squinting, so draw another 
smaller line under the lines for the eyes that meets towards his nose 
and moves towards the sides of his face in a slightly downward fashion. 
Don’t forget his ears, which are round and protrude out from the sides 
of his head. Draw two large oval half circles that begin at eye level and 
move around and down and end at the middle of his mouth level (see 
Figure 11-5).
 
3. Add a shirt and tie to the leader of the free world, like in Figure 11-6.
 
 His tie is slightly loosened and his collar is open just a bit. It was very 
common for Obama to appear this way, especially during the long days 
on the campaign trail.

 Chapter 11: Drafting Editorial Cartoon Characters
Creating Classic Editorial 
Cartoon Characters
Editorial cartooning has classic and genre-specific characters that editorial 
cartoonists regularly use as metaphors and symbols. These classic charac-
ters are easily recognizable and have become American icons. They include 
the symbols for the Republican and Democratic parties, along with Uncle 
Sam, just to name a few. This section looks at some of these characters in 
more detail and the step-by-step process to creating them.
The Republican Party elephant
The elephant was officially adopted as the mascot of the Republican Party 
several years after Thomas Nast (see the sidebar “Thomas Nast: The father 
of American caricature”) drew the first editorial cartoon portraying the 
Democrats and Republicans in their now familiar animal skins in the mid 
1880s.
When drawing your Republican elephant, remember these common traits:
 
✓ Large body and accurate elephant features
 
✓ Usually dressed in dark, pin-striped suit
 
✓ Usually portrayed as pro-military and conservative on social issues.
When drawing the elephant, keep these traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch a large circle for the body, sketch a smaller circle for the 
head above it, and draw the center guidelines in both circles, as in 
Figure 11-7.
 
 The elephant is going to have a nice, wide midsection, so don’t be afraid 
to go big on the belly!
 
2. Sketch the elephant’s arms and legs on each side of the large wide 
torso area (refer to Figure 11-7).
 
 To draw the arms, use the figure as reference and draw the right arm so 
that it falls by his side and the left arm and hand in a position that shows 
he’s holding something. To add legs, draw them going straight down 
from the bottom of the torso area with his shoes pointing to the left. In 
this pose, the elephant is facing slightly to his left. His arms and legs are 

218
Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
short and stocky compared to the large round torso. This adds a sense 
of bulkiness that often represents big corporate interests or big money 
when portrayed in cartoons.
 
3. Draw the elephant’s facial features, large massive ears, and long 
iconic trunk (see Figure 11-8).
 
 The trunk and tusks are long and dominate the center of his facial fea-
tures. The other dominant features are his ears, which are large and 
slightly squared-shaped. Elephants have small eyes by comparison, 
and he can also look good in small wire glasses. His mouth is located 
beneath his trunk and therefore isn’t visible.
 
4. Complete the details on his suit and tie, like Figure 11-9 shows.
 
 You can personalize your own elephant drawing by coming up with any 
details that appeal to you and mesh with your character’s personality. In 
my figure, he’s wearing a power pin-striped suit and tie. Adding suspend-
ers and cuff links is also a nice touch. Finish off by completing his foot 
wear, which are slip-on loafers, of course!

Part II: Creating Cartoon Characters 
The Democratic Party donkey
On the left side of the aisle, you find the other major party in the U.S. — the 
Democrats. The recognized symbol for this party is the donkey. When you 
draw this symbol, keep the following few traits in mind:
 
✓ Long donkey ears and accurate donkey features
 
✓ Wears a suit, but often shown without a jacket, for a more casual, blue-
collar attitude
 
✓ Usually portrayed as pro-big government and liberal on social issues
When drawing the Democratic donkey, keep those traits in mind and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Sketch the main part of the donkey’s body as a medium-sized vertical 
oval shape, sketch a smaller horizontal oval above it for the head, and 
then draw the center guidelines in both, like in Figure 11-10.
 
2. Sketch the donkey’s arms and legs on each side of his narrow torso.
 
Figure 11-10: 
Start your 
donkey 
sketch with 
two oval 
shapes 
and center 
guidelines.
 

221
 Chapter 11: Drafting Editorial Cartoon Characters
 
 To do so, use Figure 11-10 as a reference and draw his arms so that they 
appear in an upward lifting motion. His right arm is totally visible while 
his left arm is partially hidden by his body and his right arm. To draw 
his right leg, make two lines slightly bent at the knee and draw the foot/
shoe so that it faces to the right. His left leg is in a bent and raised posi-
tion, so his knee is high and comes up past the elbow on his right arm. 
In this pose, the donkey is facing to his left and appears to be juggling 
some balls.
 
3. Draw the donkey’s long face and ears and that great jackass smile (see 
Figure 11-11).
 
 To do so, draw his nose snout so that is comes out past his stomach. His 
ears are long and point straight up and are turned to the right. The don-
key’s head is slightly turned to his left, so you see all his facial features 
from the right. His eyes are small and his snout is long, and he’s got a 
wide smile.
 
4. Add his shirt and tie (see Figure 11-12).
 
 Adding the final details is a great way to personalize your own donkey. 
To do so, add any details that strike you as amusing. In my drawing, he’s 
ditched his jacket and his shirtsleeves are rolled up, giving him that “can 
do anything” look. Including juggling!

Uncle Sam
Uncle Sam is the alter ego and iconic representative of the United States, with 
the first images of Uncle Sam dating all the way back to the War of 1812. He’s 
often depicted as a tall, lanky man with white hair, dressed in clothing that 
resembles the U.S. flag. Most of the time he wears a blue coat, red-and-white-
striped trousers, and a top hat with red and white stripes and white stars on 
a blue band.
The following are a few traits common to Uncle Sam:
 
✓ Long, lanky body
 
✓ Strong, resilient attitude
 
✓ Recognizable costume, almost like a superhero
When drawing Uncle Sam, keep those traits in mind and follow these steps:
 
1. Sketch the long, lanky body as a long vertical oval, sketch a smaller 
circle above it for the head, and then draw the center guidelines in 
both, as shown in Figure 11-13.

223
 Chapter 11: Drafting Editorial Cartoon Characters
 
Figure 11-13:
 Begin 
Uncle Sam 
with a long 
vertical oval 
and center 
guidelines.
 
 
2. Sketch Uncle Sam’s long lanky arms and legs on each side of the torso 
area.
 
 In this pose, he’s facing to his right and looking downwards. His arms 
and legs are long and lanky, like that of Abraham Lincoln’s. Draw his 
left arm so that it falls down by his side while his right arm is bouncing 
the ball. His legs are really close together so draw them so that they 
come straight down from his torso and his shoes point to the left (see 
Figure 11-14).
 
3. Draw his facial features (refer to Figure 11-14).
 
 He’s facing to his right so you see only the facial features on his left 
side. His eyes are small and he has high, narrow cheekbones. His hair is 
slightly long in the back, and the tall top hat sits atop his head.
 
4. Fill in the final details, like in Figure 11-15.
 
 You can add features like the stripes on his pants and the stars on his 
tie, hat, and jacket lapels. His clothing can be worn in many different 
ways depending on his situation and the task he’s doing. Without his 
jacket and his sleeves rolled up he looks like he’s ready to get down to 
the business of defending the nation.

Roll with the punches: 
Dealing with readers’ responses
One of the most interesting things about being 
in a profession that specializes in forming opin-
ions is the strong response, both positive and 
negative, you generate from individuals who 
read your editorial cartoons. Sometimes people 
like what you have to say. Other times people 
are vocal in their dislike of your opinions, and 
they usually don’t hesitate in expressing their 
own opinion.
If you pursue editorial cartoons as a career, 
have some published, and then get some reader 
responses, I suggest you do what I do. Most of 
the time, regardless of what the readers say, I 
simply respond with a single sentence that says, 
“Thank you for your interest in my work.” I’ve 
learned over the past decade not to take what 
readers say personally. Take the comments 
with a grain of salt and as further evidence of 
the power and importance of editorial cartoons 
in our political and social discourse. Besides, 
it’s fun to ruffle people’s feathers!
E-mail has changed the way editorial cartoon-
ists get feedback from the public. You may get 
complimentary e-mails and comments from 
readers who like how you expressed an idea 
or drew something. On the flip side, you can 
get some negative e-mail, so be prepared. An 
unsettling trend in e-mailing is that people are 
much more vicious and mean-spirited when 
they e-mail than they would be if they wrote a 
letter or confronted you in person. Perhaps this 
is because e-mailing is a much more instan-
taneous thing, and when they stumble upon a 
cartoon on a Web site they find disagreeable, 
bullets start flying and hit their target (that’s 
you) quickly.
Some of the more memorable comments I see 
regarding my editorial cartoons are things like:
 
 “Just read your cartoon . . . you suck!”
 
 “You’re nothing but a conservative Nazi.”
 
 “You’re nothing but a liberal scumbag.”
The last two depend strictly on how the reader 
perceives the point of the cartoon. In their eyes, 
if you criticize a conservative politician or cause 
you’re liberal, and if you criticize a liberal politi-
cian or cause you’re a conservative. You may 
be amused that readers can make assumptions 
about your political affiliations based on one 
cartoon, but they do!

The Obama cartoon controversy
In July of 2008, The New Yorker gained national 
attention and attracted a firestorm of contro-
versy over its cartoon cover. The cover was 
entitled “The Politics of Fear,” by Barry Blitt and 
depicted Democratic nominee Barack Obama 
in a turban, dressed in a long Middle Eastern 
style robe, fist bumping with his wife, Michelle 
Obama. Michelle Obama was portrayed with a 
large Afro hairstyle while wearing camouflage 
pants and holding an AK-47 assault rifle. Both 
were standing in the Oval Office with a portrait 
of Osama bin Laden hanging on the wall while 
an American flag burned in the fireplace.
According to the magazine’s editors, the intent 
of the cover was to satirize the rumors and 
misconceptions about Obama. Vicious rumors 
about the Obamas had been floating around and 
were beginning to be reflected in public opin-
ion polls. The magazine set out to throw all the 
images together in an attempt to shine a harsh 
light on the rumors in an effort to satirize them.
However, on the heels of the controversy 
that followed, the editors acknowledged the 
misunderstanding, particularly by those un-
familiar with the subtle humor the magazine is 
famous for.

Y
ou may have good ideas, and you may be able to 
draw well, but how do you put the two together to 
create viable cartoons? In this part, I tell you how to bring 
it all together, from assembling the cartoon background to 
using the right type of lettering. I also discuss how to 
maintain the proper perspective and how to lay out a 
scene that adds depth and detail to your cartoon world.

Chapter 12
Putting Everything in Your 
Comics in Perspective
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding perspective and the vanishing point
▶ Drawing household items using various perspectives
▶ Sketching your characters in perspective
C
artoon characters are, by nature, one-dimensional, unless you’re putting 
your characters into a pop-up book. But they don’t have to look one-
dimensional. Drawing your cartoons with the illusion that they exist in more 
than one plane is part of the art of cartooning. In this chapter, I give you the 
tools to take your characters and cartoons from flat images to two- or three-
dimensional drawings, adding depth, realism, and interest to your artwork.
Grasping What Perspective Is
As you look around the real world, everything you see is from a three-
dimensional viewpoint. So for your cartoon world to look like the real world, 
you must draw objects in proper perspective. When you’re drawing cartoons, 
the term perspective refers to the technique of drawing that creates the 
illusion of space and depth in a flat panel.
Perspective basically means that an object appears to get smaller as the 
distance between the object and the viewer gets bigger. For example, as a car 
drives away from you, it gets smaller in perspective. Perspective doesn’t just 
apply to moving objects, though; it also applies to objects that are just sitting 
in place, like buildings. If you look at a building, the sides that are visible to you 
appear to get smaller the farther away they are from where you’re standing.

230
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
Your first attempts as an artist are probably to draw things in a flat and 
simple manner. However, with a basic understanding of the principles of per-
spective, you can increase the depth of your art and have a lot of fun doing 
it. This section gives you an overview of what perspective is and isn’t and the 
different types of perspective you can use when drawing your cartoons.
You can quickly see the difference in perspective by simply drawing a box as 
a flat square or drawing it so that it looks like a cube (see Figure 12-1). The 
cube is much more interesting to look at — and much more fun to draw!
 
Figure 12-1:

perspective 
looks better 
than draw-
ing them 
without.
 
Starting with the vanishing 
point and horizon line
The element that gives objects in a drawing perspective is called the vanish-
ing point. The vanishing point is the point on the horizon where parallel lines 
appear to meet. For example, if you look down a set of railway tracks as they 
go off into the distance, you know the two track edges are parallel to each 
other and remain the same distance apart. However, the farther away they 
get, the closer they appear to get to each other.
The other important element in understanding perspective is the horizon line. 
The horizon line (HL) in perspective drawing is a virtual line drawn at the 
viewer’s eye level; it gives a point of reference for the vanishing points as to 
whether objects are going to be seen straight on, from above, or from below in 
your cartoon. Figure 12-2 shows the vanishing point and horizon line.
As the tracks fade away in the distance, the edges seem to convene and end 
up at a single point on the horizon. This is the vanishing point (VP). Any 
object you draw in perspective that includes parallel lines has one or more 
vanishing points.

did the 
train go?
 
 
To create a proper perspective, start with the vanishing point as the point of 
reference for the drawing. You don’t have to mark a big X in your drawing to 
designate where the vanishing point or points are, but you should be aware of 
the general location so that all the appropriate angles line up accordingly. 
Introducing 1-2-3 point perspective
When drawing your cartoons, you want to make sure everything looks in bal-
ance and in place. Drawing objects in the correct scale and from the correct 
perspective gives your cartoon a richer, more realistic and natural appear-
ance that isn’t jarring to the eye.
When introducing perspective in your artwork, you have three main choices. 
This section explains how to draw from one-, two-, or three-point perspec-
tives. The number of points refers to the number of vanishing points in each 
drawing. Check out the section “Putting Perspective to Practical Use,” later in 
this chapter, for ways you can implement these perspective points into your 
drawings.
Drawing one-point perspective
A one-point perspective drawing is a drawing with a single vanishing point on 
the horizon line. This is the standard “receding railroad tracks” phenomenon 
demonstrated in Figure 12-2.
 
You typically use one-point perspective for objects that have lines either 
directly parallel with the viewer’s line of sight or directly perpendicular (such 
as railroad slats). So you can use one-point perspective for roads, railroad 
tracks, or buildings with the front directly facing the viewer. Figure 12-3 shows 
an example of a drawing in one-point perspective.

Figure 12-3:

place on the 
horizon.
 
Utilizing two-point perspective
With two-point perspective, your drawing has lines parallel to two different 
angles. You can have any number of vanishing points in a drawing, one for 
each separate set of parallel lines that are at an angle relative to the plane of 
the drawing. 
 
If you have more than one vanishing point in two-point perspective, all the 
vanishing points have to exist on the same horizon line — in other words, at 
the same eye level perspective.
You can use two-point perspective to draw the same objects that you draw 
with one-point perspective, only from a rotated view. For example, if you 
were standing directly in front of a house and moved to a position looking 
at the house’s corner, you’d see another dimension. One wall would recede 
toward one vanishing point, and the other wall would recede toward the 
opposite vanishing point. Check out Figure 12-4 for an example of a drawing 
with two-point perspective.

You can see 
both sides in 
a two-point

233
 Chapter 12: Putting Everything in Your Comics in Perspective
Drawing three-point perspective
Another option you have for adding perspective to your cartoons is to use 
the three-point perspective. You can use three-point perspective for things like 
buildings seen from above. In addition to the two vanishing points from the 
two-point perspective — one for each wall — a three-point perspective draw-
ing has another vanishing point where those walls recede into the ground 
(the third vanishing point is actually below the ground). Another common 
use of three-point perspective is a drawing that looks up at a tall building. In 
this case, the third vanishing point is high up out of view, somewhere in outer 
space. Figure 12-5 shows an example of a drawing in three-point perspective.

Recognizing the wrong perspective
You don’t have to be the world’s greatest art critic or an expert in geometry 
to know that something drawn from the wrong perspective just doesn’t look 
right. It’s natural for your brain to have an intuitive negative reaction to a 
drawing in which something is incorrect. (Modern art may be the exception to 
this!) When drawing your cartoons, make sure the perspective corresponds to 
the real world around you. Otherwise, the overall composition will fail. Figure 
12-6 shows an example in which the perspective is off.
Do you see the problem? It’s the picture on the wall behind the chair. It just 
sort of jumps out at you, doesn’t it? Your eye probably went right to the 
object in the drawing that’s not in the correct perspective because your 
brain was telling you that something just wasn’t right.

Putting Perspective to Practical Use
Putting everything into perspective isn’t difficult. You just need some basic, 
how-to knowledge and the ability to apply those concepts to the elements 
and objects you frequently draw. This section shows you how.
Sketching common, everyday 
objects in perspective
Most cartoon worlds contain everyday elements — cars, appliances, furni-
ture, and so on. Drawing them with the proper perspective is important so 
that they don’t jump out at readers and create a jarring, annoying distraction. 
You can draw these household items from various angles in two- and three-
point perspective.
Drawing a chair
A chair is a common object that you’ll probably put in your cartoons in some 
form or another when creating a story line with characters and their sur-
roundings. Chapter 9 shows you how to draw a chair. To draw a chair from 
two-point perspective, which is probably the way you’ll most frequently draw 
it, just line up each angle to the respective vanishing points on the horizon 
line. In two point perspective, vanishing points need to exist on the same 
horizon line. Figure 12-7 shows a chair from two-point perspective. You can 
see the parallel lines that indicate the two different angles as they go off in 
the direction of two separate vanishing points on the same horizon line.

235
 Chapter 12: Putting Everything in Your Comics in Perspective
 
Figure 12-7: 
A chair in 
two-point 
perspective.
 
If you want to draw the chair as if you were looking down at it from a bal-
cony, you can draw it in three-point perspective. To do so, you need to draw 
the chair so that is has three different angles pointing in the direction of 
three different vanishing points.
These vanishing points can and should usually be far out of the parameters 
of the composition. As long as the angles are lined up and eventually will 
reach a vanishing point, the object will retain the right perspective and look 
natural. If you try to have the vanishing points meet in the drawing, the 
object will probably look distorted rather than natural. Figure 12-8 shows an 
example of a chair in three-point perspective. You can see the parallel lines 
that indicate the three different angles. Objects drawn in three-point perspec-
tive tend to look more dramatic.

Sitting at your desk
A desk is another common object that you’ll probably draw many times in 
some form or another when creating a story line with characters and their 
surroundings. Figure 12-9 shows the desk from a two-point perspective. You 
can see the parallel lines that indicate the two different angles.
 
Figure 12-9: 
A desk in 
two-point 
perspective.
 
Figure 12-10 shows the desk from a three-point perspective. This is probably 
the way you would draw the desk if one of your characters was looking down 
at it. You can see the parallel lines that indicate the three different angles. 
 
Figure 12-10: 
A desk in 
three-point 
perspective.
 
Focusing on the fridge
The refrigerator’s nice rectangular shape is similar to the boxy or square 
shape of many other household items, such as TVs, beds, radios, microwave 
ovens, toasters, and so on. Chapter 9 shows you how to draw different house-
hold appliances. To draw your fridge in two-point perspective, you need to 
line up two different angles so that they meet two different vanishing points 
on the same horizon line, if you were to draw a ruler out as far as the line goes. 
However, most of the time, the vanishing point goes out past the drawing and 

237
 Chapter 12: Putting Everything in Your Comics in Perspective
would end up off the paper you’re drawing on. Figure 12-11 shows an example 
of a fridge in two-point perspective. You can see the parallel lines that indi-
cate the two different angles meeting on the same horizon line.
 
Figure 12-11: 
A fridge in 
two-point 
perspective. 
If you want to draw the fridge as if one of your characters were looking down 
at it as she stood on a ladder changing a light bulb, you can draw the fridge 
from a three-point perspective. To do so, you need to have three different 
angles lined up with three different vanishing points. This differs from two-
point perspective because not all the vanishing points end up on the same 
horizon point in three-point perspective. Figure 12-12 shows an example of 
a fridge in three-point perspective. You can see the dramatic angles of each 
fridge and how they indicate the three different angles and vanishing points.

The fridge in

238
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
Juggling multiple elements in perspective
Most of the time, you won’t be drawing cartoons with just a single element; 
chances are you’ll be drawing objects in relation to other objects around 
them. Consequently, it’s important to demonstrate how multiple objects 
work in connection to one another in two- and three-point perspectives.
For example, if you draw a chair, you’ll probably draw the objects that sit 
near the chair, such as a table and a lamp. To make sure these items are in 
two-point perspective, the lines of all the objects should be generally moving 
toward the same vanishing points on the same horizon line. This doesn’t 
mean everything has to line up perfectly, as if it were on a big grid. Objects 
are moved slightly as they’re used throughout a room. The side table may 
have been bumped or the lamp may have been moved around when it was 
turned off or on. However, the lamp and table are in the correct scale and 
perspective in relation to the chair. Figure 12-13 shows the parallel lines that 
indicate two different angles in the chair, side table, and lamp.
 
Figure 12-13: 
A chair, 
table, and 
lamp in 
two-point 
perspective.
 
If you want to create more of a dramatic background, you can use three-point 
perspective with this grouping of furniture. To do so, you want to line up all 
the objects so they meet one of three different vanishing points. Two of those 
vanishing points meet on the horizon line, and the other meets somewhere 
either below ground level or in outer space, depending on what you’re draw-
ing. Figure 12-14 shows an example; you can see the parallel lines that indi-
cate the three different angles.
Looking down: A bird’s-eye view
Understanding perspective is very important if you want to create height or 
depth in your drawing. The term used to describe a scene viewed from above 
is called a bird’s-eye view. The term comes from the fact that the viewer’s 
angle and perspective is the same as a bird’s if it were flying high up in the air 

239
 Chapter 12: Putting Everything in Your Comics in Perspective
over the object. That doesn’t mean you have to draw the scene as if you’re a 
half mile up in the sky; it just means that you’re looking down at the objects 
you’re drawing.
 
Figure 12-14: 
The chair, 
table, and 
lamp in 
three-point 
perspective.
 
 
Things drawn in a bird’s-eye view fall into the three-point perspective cate-
gory and, if done correctly, can look extreme and very dramatic. The bird’s-
eye view differs from this chapter’s previous examples of three-point 
perspective simply because the object is viewed from directly (or nearly 
directly) above.
 
To draw things from this perspective, make sure that the top of the object is 
the area that’s most visible. Because the angle is so dramatic, the vanishing 
point moving toward the third horizon line disappears below the object, and 
that vanishing point isn’t visible from this angle. For an example, look at Figure 
12-15. The bird’s-eye view of the refrigerator is much more dramatic than a 
straight-on view. The area most visible is the top, and you can barely see the 
sides. Notice how you can see the milk and other food items on the shelves 
and on the inside of the open door. 
You can also draw other elements from a bird’s-eye view. Figure 12-16 shows 
an example of a utility truck. Chapter 9 explains how to draw a basic truck. 
Drawing it from a bird’s-eye view creates a drawing that’s more visually inter-
esting than other angles or views. The truck on the right is more of a box 
shape, and the roof, hood, and truck bed are the areas that are most visible.
 
When you’re attempting to draw from a bird-eye view, it may be helpful to 
use a prop, like a toy truck, so that you can see how the vehicle looks from 
this viewpoint. Notice that the top of the truck’s roof is most visible, along 
with the bed of the truck. The right door is barely visible, and you can see 
just a sliver of the back window on the cab of the truck and the tailgate. If you 
didn’t make these areas just slightly visible, the perspective wouldn’t look 

240
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
correct. The key is to study the object you’re drawing from the correct per-
spective to be sure what you’re drawing is correct, from a perspective point 
of view. This angle is dramatic; it adds interest to the object and allows you 
more ways to tell a story.

Putting Your Characters in Perspective
Inanimate objects aren’t the only things you need to draw in perspective; 
your characters need to have the proper perspective as well. Unlike square 
and linear objects such as refrigerators, TVs, cars, trucks, and buildings, 
your characters’ shapes are less boxy and therefore may be more of a 

241
 Chapter 12: Putting Everything in Your Comics in Perspective
challenge for you to draw. No need to worry — putting things in perspective 
is all about lining up an element’s parallel lines with the respective vanishing 
points. Check out Chapters 6 and 7 for step-by-step details on creating basic 
cartoon characters. This section explains how to ensure your characters are 
in perspective.
Lining up body shapes
You need to not only draw your characters in proper perspective with the 
things around them but also draw their body parts in proper perspective to 
each other. Because body shapes are rounded and generally nonlinear, this 
skill can be difficult to master at first. The next sections explain how, start-
ing with a body type that’s more linear than most, because angular types are 
easiest to line up to a vanishing point.
Linear body shape
Drawing a linear body shape, or one that’s boxy and has sharp angles, is 
easier to line up to a vanishing point than a nonlinear body shape, simply 
because the nonlinear shape has no defined or obvious angles to line up to 
the vanishing point. To draw a linear body shape, you first need to break 
down the character into three main body parts:
 
✓ The head and neck area (the top)
 
✓ The torso and arms area (the middle)
 
✓ The legs and feet area (the bottom)
Break these areas down to three box shapes:
 
✓ The head and neck area is box A
 
✓ The torso and arms area is box B
 
✓ The legs and feet area is box C
If you draw your characters in a normal, straight-on view, you stack the three 
boxes on top of each other, as Figure 12-17 demonstrates. 
 
If you want to draw the three boxes in three-point perspective, line up three 
different angles so that they lead off in the direction of three different vanish-
ing points. Figure 12-18 shows an example where the box on the top is the first 
you see, followed by the box in the middle, and then the box on the bottom. 
You can see how the square edges of the boxes line up nicely with the parallel 
lines leading to the same vantage point that moves down and meets below 
ground level.

Nonlinear body shape
Most characters you draw will probably be nonlinear (unless you’re drawing 
robots), which means they lack the hard, sharp angles and edges you find on 
more linear objects like a TV or refrigerator. Your characters probably won’t 
have the perfectly square shapes that the three stacked boxes have in the 
previous section. They’ll have more curves and be more rounded, and lining 
up something without clear lines to a vanishing point may prove to be frus-
trating to you. However, if you know how to line up the basic body shapes of 
your characters (circles and ovals), then drawing them in perspective may 
prove easier than you think.

243
 Chapter 12: Putting Everything in Your Comics in Perspective
 
If you draw your characters in a normal, straight-on view, the shapes need to 
line up so that A, B, and C are lined up. Figure 12-19 shows an example with 
three circles stacked on top of each other. Each circle has a label — A, B, or C. 
The head and neck area is circle A, the torso and arms area is circle B, and the 
legs and feet area is circle C. 
 
Figure 12-19: 
The basic 
character 
shape from 
a straight-
on view. 
How would you draw that same character in three-point perspective? If you 
think in terms of three balls stacked on top of one another, what would you 
see first? The answer is the top ball, or A circle. You’d then see the second 
ball, or B circle, and then the third ball, or C circle. So to draw the balls in 
three-point perspective, draw horizontal and vertical center guidelines to 
help determine the middle line and give the shapes some dimension. Figure 
12-20 shows an example.
 
Figure 12-20: 
The ball 
frames in 
three-point 
perspective.
 

244
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
By erasing the lines from inside the balls in Figure 12-20, you can create a 
solid body look. You can see the top of the A ball and see balls B and C as 
they stick out from under the top ball (see Figure 12-21), which gives you a 
snowman look.
 
Figure 12-21:
 Three 
balls form a 
snowman. 
Drawing from the top of the head down
Using the three stacked balls sample from the previous section as a guide, 
you can draw a character in the same fashion. You see that the character in 
Figure 12-22 is very much like the three stacked balls in the degree to which 
each body area is visible to the viewer. The first thing you see is the top of 
the head, then the torso, then the legs and feet. These areas follow the three 
stacked balls A, B, and C.
As you move the balls in line with one another so that the top ball is more 
visible than the balls below it, the perspective becomes more of a bird’s-eye 
view. Secondly, the distance between the A and B areas becomes shorter, and 
area C begins to disappear altogether. If you were standing directly above 
someone, you probably wouldn’t be able to see his legs or much of his shoes.

245
 Chapter 12: Putting Everything in Your Comics in Perspective
As you develop your story line and comic layout, you draw your characters 
with objects surrounding them. The objects surrounding the character may 
have a linear or boxy shape. Despite this, the character’s nonlinear shape 
fits well and looks natural by comparison. That’s because both the linear and 
nonlinear shapes are drawn in the correct scale and perspective.
Drawing characters in the correct scale
You want to make sure your characters are drawn to the same scale as their 
environment, or they won’t look realistic. Although you may occasionally 
want a character to be out of proportion with his surroundings, usually to 
exaggerate a point, most of the time, you want the environment and the 
characters to look as if they’re living in a cohesive, balanced world.
The scale you draw your characters to depends on whether they’re in the fore-
ground or background of your cartoon. The decision to place your characters 
in the background or foreground depends on your story line or a decision to 
add visual drama and interest to the composition. The following looks at a few 
options you have.
Small scale; characters in the background
Characters in the background of a drawing appear smaller and smaller the 
closer they are to the vanishing point on the horizon line. For example, the 
character sitting in the chair on the left in Figure 12-23 has no background or 
foreground objects to indicate any type of scale. The same character on the 
right is shown sitting on a chair in the background of the drawing. Taking the 
same character and placing him in a setting demonstrates the importance 
of proper perspective and scale. The objects in the foreground are larger in 
scale compared to the character in the background.

Figure 12-24 shows the vantage if you were sitting on the floor looking from one 
cubicle to another. The dramatic perspective of the layout allows the reader to 
see all the way up to the lights on the ceiling as they become smaller in scale 
and move farther away behind the other cubicles in the office. The ends of the 
lights are in alignment with the vanishing point for this composition, as are the 
ends of the cubicle walls and the computer equipment in the foreground.

Large scale; characters in the foreground
Objects in the foreground of a drawing appear larger compared to surround-
ing objects as they get closer to the viewer and farther away from the vanish-
ing point. The character sitting in the chair on the left in Figure 12-25 exists in 
a void; he has no point of reference around him to indicate scale. The same 
character on the right is in the foreground of a drawing and appears larger 
compared to the objects in the background.

Putting the character in the foreground (see Figure 12-26) gives the character 
an entirely different look compared to everything around him.

You can also view three-point perspective from 
the ground up. The worm’s-eye view looks 
upwards at your cartoon world. This can be a 
humorous or dramatic point of view, and one 
not usually seen after you leave toddlerhood 
behind. Here’s what the three stacked balls 
would look like at that angle.

The Art of Lettering
In This Chapter
▶ Appreciating the importance of lettering
▶ Incorporating lettering into your cartoons
▶ Using computer fonts and creating text by hand
▶ Considering spacing with your lettering
W
hen you first start cartooning, you may be concentrating on the draw-
ing aspect, getting all your characters to look just right. However, 
the best cartoons in the world are pointless unless they say something. 
Generally, your characters need to speak, and because they can’t speak out 
loud, they have to speak with printed words.
To give your cartoon characters a voice, you want to use the appropriate 
cartoon lettering. The look and feel of the lettering can convey just as much 
as the words themselves. To create just the right lettering for your cartoons, 
you can either draw it by hand or use computer-generated lettering. In this 
chapter, I talk about the different types of lettering found in cartoons and 
how to choose the letters that best bring your characters to life.
Preparing to Letter
Most cartoon characters “speak” using printed words that are often (but not 
always) surrounded by a frame. You can draw the best cartoons in the world, 
but they can fall flat when combined with lettering that’s substandard, illeg-
ible, or sloppy. Lettering is crucial to the art as a whole in several ways:
 
✓ It affects the cartoon’s visual appearance.
 
✓ It allows your characters to communicate.
 
✓ It contributes to the story or gag line by making it comprehensible; 
obviously, if people can’t read your writing, you have a big problem on 
your hands!

250
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
 
In addition to serving a communication function, great lettering should also 
complement the art and be part of a larger creative narrative. In other words, 
great lettering should be art, too. To make your lettering help your cartoons 
stand out, check out the following sections for some basic ideas to help you 
get started.
Appreciating the role lettering plays
Lettering plays a crucial role in the success of your cartoons and comics. 
The lettering you choose to use should reflect and enhance the tone of your 
cartoon. The wrong type of lettering can create an incongruous or jarring 
effect, so lettering is one thing you want to get right.
You can create lettering styles in a variety of line widths ranging from very 
fine to heavy (see Figure 13-1 for some examples). However, you want to 
create your lettering with a line width that’s consistent with and comple-
mentary to the line width that you draw the rest of the art in. Typically, the 
line width for the lettering is smaller than that of the line art. And unlike the 
varied line width of the line art, you want to keep the line width for the letter-
ing the same so that the reader can view it easily.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Line quality 
for your 
lettering 
can vary 
from regular 
to bold.
 
 
You may want to choose a pen tip that’s fine or medium for the basic lettering 
and a thicker pen tip for lettering you use for emphasis or action, much as you 
would use normal typeface in a printed word document and bold typeface 
occasionally to make something stand out.

251
 Chapter 13: The Art of Lettering
Spending time perfecting your skills
The art of lettering doesn’t always come easily to cartoonists. The ability to 
letter clearly and legibly, and to make the lettering appealing and not stiff 
or forced, takes time and practice. Lettering is a separate skill from draw-
ing, and you shouldn’t neglect or overlook it. As your skills progress, you’ll 
become more comfortable lettering and more confident at it.
Begin by sitting down with a pad of paper and practice drawing out your letter-
ing. As you practice, you may want to use a ruler and create a horizontal base-
line to use as a guide so that the bottom of all the letters sit on this line and 
create consistent spacing from the words below it. Draw a series of horizontal 
lines and place them on top of each other, spaced evenly apart so that they 
can accommodate regular-sized handwriting written out on each line.
 
You may choose to experiment with your own lettering style or mimic well-
established lettering like a Serif style. Thousands of font styles are available. 
Buying a font style book or downloading a font guide from the Internet can 
help you create and draw your own lettering style.
Selecting the right pens
Every professional cartoonist gets asked two questions more than any other: 
“Where do you get your ideas?” and “What kind of pens do you use?” When 
creating your cartoon’s lettering, choosing the right pens is a crucial deci-
sion. Most cartoonists use a specific pen to letter with, one that differs from 
the pen they draw with. When selecting your pens, base your choice both on 
personal preference and the type of results you’re looking for.
 
The best place to start when selecting a pen is the local art supply store. Most 
stores carry a wide assortment of pens and even allow you to try them out 
before you buy them. Take advantage of this — scribble and doodle to get the 
feel for the right pen for you.
Look for pens that don’t smear and dry quickly. Also look for pens that have 
a solid line quality and adhere well to the paper on the first application. You 
don’t want to buy a pen that requires you to go over your lines many times to 
achieve a solid line.
 
The pen most cartoonists choose for lettering is capable of achieving the 
small detail work required for lettering. One of the most popular series of pens 
to come along in recent years is the Pigma Micron pens. The unmatched qual-
ity of Pigma Micron pens makes them the preferred choice of professional car-
toonists and illustrators looking for precision. See Chapter 3 for more about 
the different types of pens used for cartooning in general.

252
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
Making Lettering Part of the Art
Lettering communicates directly to readers by conveying the story or punch 
line, just as text from a book does. However, cartoon lettering differs from 
the text of a book or newspaper because it’s actually part of the art.
Lettering is a crucial part of the overall composition. Good cartoonists make 
sure that their lettering complements their style and doesn’t fight against it. 
Lettering should be easy to read but also organic; it should flow with the rest 
of the art. Certain types of lettering flow naturally with certain cartoon types; 
others clash because they “say” different things.
Cartoonists have numerous options when incorporating the lettering with the 
art. The following sections explain this in more detail.
Knowing the differences between 
handwritten and computer fonts
Cartoonists need to have a good eye for design, and lettering is a part of the 
design. You can choose to letter any way you want. The only real requirement 
is that your lettering is legible to the reader. When actually creating the letter-
ing, remember that the letters should always be large enough for the reader to 
see without dominating the composition or overshadowing the line art itself.
You basically have two options when creating lettering: handwritten or 
computer-generated fonts. Each has its pros and cons.
Handwritten lettering (Figure 13-2a) has the following going for it:
 
✓ It looks more natural.
 
✓ It better complements the surrounding cartoon.
Handwritten lettering has the following negatives:
 
✓ It takes more time to create.
 
✓ It takes more effort to ensure that the text is consistent.
Meanwhile, computer type font (Figure 13-2b) has a couple of advantages:
 
✓ It’s easy to create.
 
✓ It’s easy to read.

253
 Chapter 13: The Art of Lettering
Using computer type font does have its drawbacks, including the following:
 
✓ It looks stiff.
 
✓ It doesn’t make your cartoon distinctive.
Many amateurs use fonts because they’re impatient or because they lack the 
skill to hand letter correctly. But lettering that’s sloppy, badly spaced, too 
stiff, or illegible gives the impression to the reader that you may not know 
what you’re doing. The best remedy for this is to practice. If you’re a cartoon-
ing newbie and want an easy solution, go with the computer font and check 
out the “Going the Simple Route: Picking a Type Font” section later in the 
chapter. If you want to try your hand at crafting your own lettering, check out 
the “Going the Hand Lettering Route” section.

Placing your lettering
Where to place your lettering is an important and sometimes difficult deci-
sion that may force you to modify the cartoon’s composition. You have a 
couple of basic options when it comes to placing the lettering:
 
✓ Incorporate the text inside the cartoon’s composition.
 
✓ Place the text outside the cartoon’s composition.
Often, the option you choose depends on spacing and the type of format you 
use to draw your cartoons. In a multiple panel layout, you have the luxury of 
more space, and incorporating the lettering inside the composition may be a 
better option, as in Figure 13-3.
However, if you’re drawing a single panel cartoon like The Far Side or Family 
Circus and you need all the available space in the panel for art, then placing 
the lettering outside the cartoon is a better option, as in Figure 13-4.

Fitting in your lettering
Finding the right spot to place your lettering depends on how busy or compli-
cated the art is. The more text you have, the less available space remains for 
the art. However, sometimes you can’t avoid using a lot of text; in this case, 
just be sure to leave plenty of space when you’re sketching so you don’t have 
to erase any art later.

255
 Chapter 13: The Art of Lettering
When you write down an idea for a cartoon strip, comic panel, or editorial 
cartoon, the idea comes without regard for spacing or the layout challenges 
you face when it comes time to put pen to paper. You may have a great idea 
or story line that requires a lot of dialogue. This results in your having to 
incorporate the lettering somewhere in the composition without it obstruct-
ing the art and impeding the art’s ability to tell the story.
 
To get your lettering to fit, I suggest you experiment. Try placing the text in 
different locations in the panel, and play around with different text sizes. Try 
different options to see how your lettering fits with the art until you find one 
that looks best for your cartoon, as in Figure 13-5.

Utilizing word balloons
Word balloons are unique to cartoons. The word balloon is that round bubble 
with a squiggly tail that floats around inside most cartoons and contains dia-
logue or a character’s thoughts. When you draw word balloons, you have a 
couple of basic options:
 
✓ Round and symmetric, as in Figure 13-6a
 
✓ Unstructured or organic and blended into the surrounding art, as in 
Figure 13-6b
 
Deciding what kind of word balloons to use really depends on the overall 
style and feel of your line art. If your style is loose and spontaneous, then a 
hand-drawn word balloon is more suitable to the overall design. However, if 
your style is cleaner and more linear, then the more symmetrical word bal-
loons may better complement the surrounding layout. Of course, none of this 
is absolute, and you’re free to use your own imagination and creativity to 
experiment to find out what works best for you.

Going the Simple Route: 
Picking a Type Font
Lettering can be a tedious task, because creating legible, consistent lettering 
takes time. After a while you may dread lettering your cartoons. You’re not 
alone if lettering makes you nervous, or if the thought of hand lettering a text-
heavy story line makes you cringe. Many cartoonists find lettering a boring 
task that takes away from the actual joy of drawing.
The origins of word balloons
The word balloon was invented more than 150 
years ago when cartoons became popular in 
newspapers. The invention of the word balloon 
stemmed from the need to separate the text 
from the rest of the art and to have a buffer of 
white space around the text, allowing it to stand 
out and be easily read.
Word balloons have evolved over the years, 
just as styles have evolved. You can clearly 
see this evolution if you study many of the clas-
sic cartoons over the past century to see how 
different cartoonists have experimented with 
various word balloon techniques. Around the 
turn of the century, word balloons were small 
and drawn closely around the text. Word bal-
loons became bigger and incorporated more 
white space among the wording as cartoonists’ 
styles became more simplified and cartoony. 
However, no fast or hard rule exists as to how 
you have to draw a word balloon. Like the style 
in which you draw the line art, the word balloon 
is a matter of preference and what looks and 
feels right to you.
In any case, the original purpose of the word 
balloon still stands — to create a designated 
place for the dialogue text to appear that’s sep-
arate from the rest of the line art.

257
 Chapter 13: The Art of Lettering
If lettering your cartoons is causing your blood pressure to rise, one solu-
tion is to type out the text after you scan the cartoon into your computer in 
Photoshop. (See Chapter 15 for all the tricks available through Photoshop.) 
The drawback to this method is that your cartoon contains a standard type 
font, and, more often than not, it doesn’t look original.
If you do choose to go the type font route, many fonts are available. If you’re 
using Photoshop, the fonts you typically have in your computer’s font man-
ager are available for you to use. You may also purchase a font suite package 
that comes bundled with hundreds of different styles for you to choose from, 
if you want something a little different.
Going the Hand Lettering Route
Perhaps you want to be a tad more adventurous and want the lettering in 
your cartoons to have more of an original look and feel. If so, you may want 
to consider hand lettering your cartoons rather than using computer type 
fonts. Hand lettering is more than just writing out dialogue in your normal 
handwriting. As you begin to letter, you discover that you really are drawing 
each character letter instead of writing it.
Doing your own lettering takes time, patience, and practice. I suggest you 
work on your lettering and come up with a style that best fits the overall style 
of your art and the cartoon itself. This section helps you take your handwrit-
ing and turn it into cartoon lettering.
Creating your own unique fonts
You basically have three options when creating your own fonts. You can 
use a computer program, which is one of the easier ways; you can attempt 
to manipulate your handwritten font on-screen in each cartoon; or you can 
experiment and create your own handwritten font. This section looks at 
these three options.
Using a computer program to make a handwritten font
One alternative to using preexisting type fonts is to create your own font. 
You can use your own handwriting or use a computer font program to help 
you produce your lettering. You can purchase one at any computer soft-
ware retailer or order a copy on the Internet. Several software programs can 
help you accomplish this goal; two well-known programs are Fontifier and 
YourFonts. These programs provide you with easy, step-by-step instructions 
on what you need to do to take your own handwriting or hand lettering and 
make a font out of it.

258
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
In order to create your own font using one of these programs, follow these 
general steps:
 
1. Write out the alphabet in a style of your choice.
 
 You can use your own daily handwriting or actually draw out the indi-
vidual letters in a bolder, more stylized fashion. You may also want to 
write out the letters in rows of four letters each.
 
2. After you finish writing out the lettering to your satisfaction, scan the 
letters into the computer.
 
 You may want to scan this in at 600 dpi or better so that the letters are 
crisp and clean.
 
3. Open up the font creation program and import the newly scanned 
alphabet images.
 
4. Follow the specific instructions on formatting.
 
 When completing this process, the end result will be a new font file with 
the letters you created in it.
 
5. Upload the new font file to your computer’s font manager, and the 
font will be available for you to use in a variety of programs, depend-
ing on what you have installed on your hard drive.
One thing you can’t escape when using a type font is that the letters and lines 
of text appear uniform. This is especially noticeable with a regular text font, 
but it’s also obvious in your own handwritten font. This uniformity creates an 
artificial and rigid appearance, which is caused by what’s known as a baseline, 
or the line on which the letters sit. The baseline is there to make sure the 
typeface is straight and level and creates a uniform structure. The baseline is 
part of the font type program and is created automatically.
Manipulating after you type
One way to make the font look more handwritten is to manipulate it after you 
type it out in the computer font you create. You may want to go back and 
move random individual letters or words just slightly so that they no longer 
line up rigidly on the baseline. Doing so allows you to create text that has a 
more organic appearance, similar to if you had written it out by hand (see 
Figure 13-7).
 
If you decide to go this route, know that it’s very time-consuming; it may 
take as much time as it would to letter by hand in the first place! However, 
if you feel your hand-lettering skills aren’t up to par yet, this may be a 
viable alternative.

Experimenting with your handwriting
When you write your lettering by hand, you can also experiment with differ-
ent scripts, varying them with different cartoons or to change the mood or 
feel of a cartoon. Your options are endless, so take a notepad and try differ-
ent ones. However, when you decide to go down this road, you need to make 
sure your lettering is consistent from cartoon to cartoon so that readers can 
easily identify your work. For example, you may create a standard-looking 
cartoon lettering in capital letters, like in Figure 13-8a. If you want to get a 
little more whimsical and fancy, you may try something that looks more 
handwritten, such as Figure 13-8b. Peruse the comics to get ideas for differ-
ent types of scripts.

Creating drama with action words
You can add as much show and fervor to your comics as you like, and doing 
so with a handwritten font is easy. Everybody is familiar with the classic 
comic book action-style words like BOOM!, POW!, and WHAM! These words 
and the way they’re drawn create a sense of action and add drama to the 
visual story line. They can also serve as an important artistic element to the 
overall cartoon.
You can see how this type of bold lettering can convey action and is dynamic 
in its visual impact and expression, as in Figure 13-9.

Such words not only tell part of the story line but also add interest and action

Keeping Track of Your Spacing
The spacing between your words and letters is important, whether you 
choose to use a type font or letter by hand. Keep the following in mind to 
keep your spacing looking good:
 
✓ If you hand letter: The tendency is to run the letters or words too close 
together. The end result is sloppy lettering that may not be easy to 
read. The best solution for this is to draw out guidelines so that each 
letter and word has a baseline. As you write out the text, you simply line 
up the bottom of each letter along the line, which creates a consistent 
space between the top line and the line below it.
 
✓ If you use a type font: The opposite of sloppy is often true. The end 
result is text that appears too perfectly spaced and stiff and doesn’t look 
quite right against the backdrop of the rest of the hand-drawn art. To 
counter this, choose a font that appears to have more movement; this 
makes rigid spacing far less noticeable.

Directing the Scene
In This Chapter
▶ Improving your cartoons with the proper layout
▶ Using various drawing strategies to create visual interest
▶ Adding details to spice up your backgrounds
T
he way you draw the background, the details you include that make up 
the environment, and the manner in which you place figures all contribute 
to the story that your cartoon tells. Even the simplest sketch benefits from a 
proper layout and details that make the cartoon background come alive.
You want your cartoons to be more than just characters walking around 
in blank space. The characters need a home — a background that lets the 
reader know where they are. In this chapter, I take apart cartoon layouts to 
explain what components make for a great layout. I also show you how to add 
the background details that make your cartoons fun and visually interesting.
Eyeing the Importance of Layout
When moviemakers begin production on their new picture, one of the most 
important things they need to consider is the layout. How will things look 
through the camera lens? One of the ways filmmakers do this is by story-
boarding the movie. A storyboard is essentially a large comic strip of the film 
produced beforehand to help filmmakers see how things will play out.
 
Layout and design are crucial to the storyboarding process, and you should 
view comic strips in the same light. When designing your comic strip, think 
about layout as if you were making a movie. Layout is basically the collective 
relationship among the characters, backgrounds, how you decide to show each 
individual panel, and how these components all work together to tell a story. 
Your cartoon, like a movie, cuts from shot to shot; some shots are close-ups 
and some are long shots. You may show some shots from a certain perspec-
tive to create drama, or you may show the characters in silhouette to break 
up a monotonous visual story line.

264
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
 
Your cartoon story will be more interesting and appealing to the reader if the 
art and layout changes from panel to panel and you avoid showing just a 
bunch of talking heads (although that’s fine in some cases, if the story war-
rants it). Character placement, the perspective you choose, and the angles 
you use in each panel are all important aspects of a good layout that also add 
to your cartoon’s appeal.
This section gives you the lowdown on putting together your cartoon’s 
layout, knowing the differences between background and foreground, using 
shadows effectively, and adding important details.
Planning your layout
Layout is such an important facet of drawing cartoons. You don’t want a flat 
and boring cartoon, so make sure your cartoon world is as graphically inter-
esting as the real world. Experimenting with different perspectives, angles, 
and background details can help improve your story line and increase your 
cartoon’s visual impact.
The basic layout of the art and the placement of the characters and scenes 
are dependent on the story line. After you write the script (what the charac-
ters say in the word balloons; check out Chapter 13 for more info), you must 
plan the layout and the individual comic panels. You may go through several 
different layout roughs before achieving the desired flow.
Your layout varies depending on whether you’re doing a daily comic strip 
layout (see Figure 14-1) or a Sunday comic strip layout (see Figure 14-2). Each 
format has certain size restrictions and limitations:
 
✓ A daily comic strip layout is limited in space. The most common strip 
size that cartoonists use to draw is a horizontal strip that’s about 4 x 
13 inches. Then the strip is sent to the syndicate, which formats it and 
reduces it down to run in the newspapers. This size is challenging for 
cartoonists to work with because they simply don’t have a lot of room to 
draw and tell a story. Being creative in this format requires the cartoon-
ist to use the individual panels efficiently. 
 
✓ Sunday comic strip layout sizes are typically bigger than the dailies. 
The Sunday features are also horizontal and reduced down to fit on a 
newspaper or magazine page, but they’re not reduced as much as daily 
strips. They’re usually drawn at around 10 x 14 inches and then scaled 
down to fit the size that runs in the newspaper. This size isn’t as chal-
lenging for the artist as the daily size and permits the cartoonist to be 
more creative in the use of the individual panels.
 
 Although webcomics have no standard size, many Web cartoonists 
design their comics similar in size to a Sunday multipanel layout format.

Comparing foreground and background
Deciding whether to place characters or objects in the foreground or back-
ground of your cartoon is an important decision that affects your story line. 
The foreground is generally where the main action takes place; objects in 
the foreground often appear more dramatic because of their larger scale. 
In contrast, being in the background allows readers to view an object more 
completely, depending on how far back the object is placed. Images in the 
foreground can add drama to your cartoons, and images in the background 
can add detail and texture.

Figure 14-3 is an example of an image in the immediate foreground. As you 
can see, the door is positioned so that you see only a close-up of the middle 
section and door knob. The clothes hanging in the closet are also in the fore-
ground. The combination of these two views gives the impression that the 
viewer is in the closet looking outward. The choice of placement adds drama 
and scale to the layout and composition.

 Chapter 14: Directing the Scene
Telling the story in shadow
A four-panel comic layout can be boring and repetitive if each panel looks the 
same. One way to add a little variety is to have the images or characters in one 
of the panels appear in shadow or silhouette. Using shadows and silhouettes in 
the course of comic storytelling can be a powerful way to communicate mood 
or tone.
For example, if the first two panels of your cartoon are action-oriented and 
then you pull back to show the characters in shadow or silhouette in panel 
three, the art and punch line in panel four may have a stronger impact on the 
reader. The visual joke delivers more punch because of the delay in panel 
three. This is similar to a comedian pausing for just a moment right before he 
delivers a joke’s punch line.
Figure 14-5 shows how drawing characters or other objects in a panel using a 
shadow or silhouette can play out visually. 
 
Figure 14-5:

Creating visual drama
You can also experiment with your cartoon’s layout and create visual drama 
in a comic panel. Some of the ways to add visual drama to your cartoons 
include
 
✓ Drawing things from a dramatic perspective. Drawing buildings or city-
scapes from dramatic angles helps create scale and can have a dramatic 
impact. For more information about drawing things in perspective, 
thumb through Chapter 12.
 
✓ Showing foreground objects in extreme close-up. Not everything in 
your layout has to be the same size and scale. Drawing objects in large 
scale and placing them in the foreground helps create dramatic weight 

268
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
and can be an excellent layout strategy. For example, say you squat 
down next to a car’s bumper while looking past it down the street. If you 
sketch that scene, you have both a prominent object in the foreground 
(the bumper) and other, smaller objects off in the distance.
Setting the Scene
The sets you design in a comic strip setting serve the same purpose as in 
movies. In a movie, the set designer creates and builds the sets in which the 
actors interact with one another. With a cartoon strip, you don’t construct 
actual sets, of course, but the background is just as important. You want to 
capture the appropriate details and objects to make the set look realistic 
while also making the art interesting for the reader to look at. This section 
covers how you can create amazing scenes for your cartoons.
Details make the difference in a scene
You want your cartoon’s setting to be accurate and believable but also to 
have personality. You want the setting to reflect the style in which you draw 
the characters so the art has a synergy and is appealing to the reader.
 
You can really create an interesting scene by all the little details you add. 
Just open your eyes and look at the hundreds of details around you. Details 
add a sense of authenticity to what you’re drawing and give readers more 
interesting things to look at. It doesn’t matter whether the scene is inside or 
outside — bedrooms, kitchens, offices, bathrooms, closets, garages, build-
ings, signs, roads, bridges, and fields are filled with all sorts of surfaces, 
textures, and shapes. For instance, if your characters live in middle-class 
suburbia, the details you add to the drawing tell readers a lot about the 
characters.
As an example, take a look at Figure 14-6. This room is plain and kind of 
stark. Perhaps the characters that live here are blue-collar, or maybe your 
comic is about a bunch of college students living in a small apartment who 
don’t have much.
By comparison, look at the same room in Figure 14-7, which has many more 
details. This room is more interesting to look at because of the details like 
texture, depth, patterns, furniture, knickknacks, and so on. Not everything 
you create has to look like this fancy room, but at least you can see how the 
details make the drawing a better overall setting for your characters — and 
the more detailed version is a lot more fun to draw!

269
 Chapter 14: Directing the Scene
Much of the impact of this image relies on overlapping, which is key to under-
standing scale, object relationships, and depth. The chairs, table, lamp, and 
other objects are all positioned in the room so as to allow the viewer to see 
only portions of them as they sit behind larger objects in the foreground.

Creating your scene
Much if not most of the time, the setting you choose is predetermined by 
your story line. If your story involves a new bride cooking Thanksgiving 
dinner for the first time, you’re not going to use a national forest for the set-
ting. Or if, for example, you have two characters walking and talking through-
out the entire story line, you may want to set the scene outdoors so they 
can walk and talk for as long as you need them to, as showing the characters 
walking around and around the house would get repetitious and artificial. So 
let your story line naturally determine what kind of setting you choose.

270
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
A room with a view — setting the scene indoors
Creating a room for your characters is like being a set designer. You have 
to know all the elements that go into the setting, what looks good, and what 
works best for the story line.
 
To get a good feel for what goes into designing the indoor sets for your 
cartoon, take some time and walk around your own house and take some 
notes. How does your kitchen look and how is it laid out? What about the 
bathrooms and bedrooms? And the den? Making sure you include the 
right furniture, wall hangings, wallpaper patterns, and other particulars — 
right down to the door handles — helps you create an interesting, believ-
able setting. As you create an indoor setting, don’t forget to add elements 
that indicate an indoor setting, such as doorways, stairs, or pictures on 
the walls.
Figure 14-8 shows a bedroom. Details like the basketball on top of the dresser 
indicate that a teenager may live here — although the closet looks a little too 
neat to belong to a teenage boy!

ing patterns to the composition.
Figure 14-10 shows an example of a kitchen. Details like the appliances, pots 
and pans, kitchen throw rug, and cabinets all add texture to the setting.

Urban planning — setting the scene outdoors
Setting a scene outdoors requires you to understand the urban landscape 
and all the trappings of a modern society. Take a stroll outside and take a 
good look around. What do you notice? In addition to trees, parks, grass, 
bushes, and so on, you may notice sidewalks, roads, power lines, billboards, 
signs, shopping malls, and all the other evidence of a commercialized, urban 
environment. This phenomenon has another name — urban sprawl.

272
Part III: Cartoon Designs 101: Assembling the Parts 
 
Although this sprawl may inspire you to put on a pair of sandals and protest 
urbanization, drawing all this stuff can make for some interesting settings and 
backgrounds for your characters. Drawing outside details isn’t difficult. 
Adding a bit of sky, clouds, street vendors, and vehicles gives the setting away 
and makes your background more interesting to look at, but don’t stop there. 
Add elements that make your setting instantly identifiable.
Figure 14-11 shows an example of a rural outdoor setting. Notice big details 
like the truck and the trailer parked up on blocks, and smaller details like the 
broken blinds, wooden steps, and ugly front door — this ain’t Park Avenue!

Cartooning 2.0: 
Taking Your Cartoons 
to the Next Level

In this part . . .
You have the basics of cartooning down, and you 
want to ramp up your efforts. In this part, I look 
at the incredible tools available to today’s cartoonists, 
including computers, the image editing software 
Photoshop, and computer animation. All professional 
cartoonists today use computers as part of their art, and 
if you want to discover how to play with the big boys, this 
part can show you how.

▶ Finalizing your work
C
artooning has changed in the last few decades, thanks to the power and 
creative ability of computers. Computers can make just about every 
aspect of cartooning easier, from creating and editing your art right on the 
computer to sending files to clients or newspapers almost instantaneously.
Computers can make you a better artist. Granted, the computer doesn’t 
actually draw for you any more than a pencil draws for you, but computers 
can and do improve your skills as an artist by providing you with digital 
technology that’s become essential in this competitive era. They make the 
production of your work much more efficient by allowing you to digitally 
color your art, easily correct mistakes, and format and e-mail your work to 
interested parties.
In this chapter, I look at the ways cartoonists work with computers on a daily 
basis and the ways you can use a computer to improve your work.
Digitally Formatting Your Drawings
Getting your artwork from paper to computer is known as digitally formatting 
your art. To get artwork from paper to computer, you need a basic piece of 
equipment known as a scanner. Scanners, or more specifically, flatbed scan-
ners, are absolutely essential to cartooning today, because without one, you 
can’t digitize your artwork. 

276
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
With a scanner, you place your drawing face down on the surface like you 
would a copy machine. From your computer you operate the scanner controls, 
and within a few minutes your art is transferred digitally and appears on your 
computer screen, ready for you to color, e-mail, or post on your Web site!
Fortunately, scanners, compared to other computer devices, are relatively 
inexpensive. This section walks you through what you need to know about 
digitizing your art, including getting the right scanner, scanning in your work, 
and saving it in the proper format so you can work with it.
Choosing a scanner
To be able to digitize your artwork, you need to scan your cartoons into 
your computer. The scanner you select can make a significant impact on the 
quality of your digital work. When choosing a scanner, you have three basic 
options:
 
✓ A relatively inexpensive flatbed scanner: This type of machine can 
scan in black-and-white line art and text documents.
 
✓ A full-color flatbed scanner: This type can be quite costly, but it allows 
you to scan high resolution photos or other completed art.
 
✓ An inexpensive three-in-one unit: This option consists of a scanner, 
copier, and printer.
So which should you choose? I actually prefer options one and three; 
here’s why:
 
✓ You’re probably going to be drawing your art on paper using black-
and-white ink, pens, or pencils, and then using the computer to color 
it. In this case, you need only a scanner with the ability to scan in your 
work at a relatively high optical resolution. 
 
✓ Most flatbed scanners do a great job scanning in basic black-and-white 
or grayscale images. Thus you can take the less expensive route without 
compromising the quality of the finished product. The scanner I have cost 
about $150, and all I ever do with it is scan in black-and-white originals. 
 
✓ The more expensive, full-color scanners can cost thousands of dol-
lars. However, because I use Photoshop to color my cartoons instead of 
watercolors, markers, or paints, I never scan in anything but black-and-
white line art, so I really have no need for a color scanner, and you prob-
ably won’t either. 
However, if you actually color all your artwork by hand with markers, colored 
pencils, or watercolors, you may opt for a full-color scanner, which can get 
expensive. Some of the three-in-one units allow for some colored scanning, 
although they usually don’t produce high quality results. 

277
 Chapter 15: Cartooning in the Digital Age
Scanning your work into the computer
After you purchase a scanner, you’re ready to start scanning in your artwork. 
Before you do so, you need to connect it to your computer, which is a simple 
process. All you do in most cases is this:
 
1. Use a USB port or other connection method and follow the manufac-
turer’s instructions to connect to the computer.
 
2. Install a scanner driver by inserting the CD that comes with the scan-
ner into your computer’s disc drive and follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions on the software disc. 
 
3. From the scanner monitor on your desktop, you’re now ready to scan 
something in! 
The scanner is a relatively simple device to use; in many ways it works like 
a photocopier. A flatbed scanner is usually composed of a glass pane, under 
which is a bright lighting source that illuminates the pane, and a moving opti-
cal array. Just like a copy machine, you place the art or document face down 
on the glass and close the lid. When you press the start button (this is located 
either on the scanner itself or operated from the scanner driver installed on 
your computer’s desktop), the sensor array and light source move across the 
pane, capturing the image you placed face down on the glass.
The main difference between a copier and a scanner is that with a scanner, 
the image appears on the computer screen instead of being printed out on a 
piece of paper. However, you can still print the image by using the print com-
mand on your computer after you save, change, color, or further enhance it 
on the computer. 
Setting the correct resolution
Before scanning your work into the computer, you need to set the resolution 
on your scanner. Resolution affects the clarity of your image; the higher the 
resolution, the sharper the image will appear. Resolution is expressed as the 
physical dot density of an image or number of dots per inch (DPI) when the 
image is physically reproduced by being printed onto paper or displayed on a 
monitor. The higher the DPI, the clearer the image and the better you can see 
small details. Most scanners have settings that range between 25–9600 DPI.
 
Most black-and-white line art cartoons can be scanned in at between 300–600 
DPI. This level of resolution ensures a nice, clean line reproduction and works 
well for newsprint. I don’t recommend going below the 300 DPI level if your art 
will eventually be printed. However, you can go substantially lower, to 72 DPI, 

278
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
if the image will be used only for Web reproduction. Computer monitors can 
display only 72 pixels per inch, so setting the DPI of your Web images higher 
than 72 only wastes file space. 
 
However, scanning in your art at a high DPI level is always a good idea so that 
you have a high resolution original that you can copy and reformat later. Keep 
in mind that if you scan in the art at a higher resolution, the file size will be 
bigger, and this may make it harder to work with the file, depending on how 
much memory your computer has. If you stay in the 300–600 DPI range the file 
size should be manageable. You can always go down in resolution but you can 
never go up, as this will cause distortion.
To set the correct DPI, do the following. Figure 15-1 shows you a screenshot.
 
1. Open up the scanner monitor on your computer desktop.
 
2. A box appears that allows you to configure the items you’re about 
to scan.
 
3. Find the box in the scanner monitor that controls DPI and either move 
the setting up to increase the DPI or down to reduce it. Most scanner 
monitors also allow you to manually type in the DPI number setting 
you require.

Selecting a Photoshop mode: Bitmap, 
grayscale, RGB, and CMYK
When you scan in your artwork, you need to make one more decision. When 
using the most common software, Photoshop, you have to choose the 
correct mode because this helps format the item being scanned in for 

279
 Chapter 15: Cartooning in the Digital Age
optimum reproduction. Photoshop offers several different settings to 
choose from: bitmap, grayscale, RGB, and CMYK, each one appropriate for 
different purposes. If you’re not using Photoshop, then the program you’re 
using will have its own mode setting. However, it will also have bitmap, 
grayscale, RGB, and CMYK, as these are all universal. The next sections 
look at the pros and cons of each in more detail, so you can choose the 
right setting at the right time for your work.
Using bitmap
In my experience, scanning in your black-and-white cartoons as a bitmap is 
almost always best. You can always convert it to grayscale or CMYK later. 
Bitmap images are pixel-based. To understand what a pixel is, imagine an 
image of a beach ball drawn on a grid of 800 columns by 600 rows. Each cell 
of the grid represents a pixel of the larger bitmap image.
Scanning in line art as a bitmap ensures that the lines are crisp and the detail 
is clear as long as you don’t increase the size of the art. When you scan in 
your artwork using bitmap, make sure you use a high resolution DPI level so 
that you have a high resolution original you can copy and reduce in size later 
if necessary.
The quality of a bitmap image depends mainly on its resolution, which is the 
number of dots or pixels per inch of space. Therefore, resizing bitmap images 
results in poorer image quality. Decreasing bitmap image size means decreas-
ing pixels per inch, so some pixels are removed. This results in less sharp 
images. This only works if the art stays the same size as it was originally 
scanned or is reduced during the final printing/reproduction in a newspaper 
or magazine. 
Increasing bit map image size means that new pixels have to be created. These 
new pixels can be only approximations and not accurate replications of the 
original pixels. This results in splotchy images with lots of pixel noise.
 
A bitmap image is resolution-dependent, because it uses a fixed number of 
pixels to represent its image data. Zooming the bitmap image of the beach ball 
causes it to lose quality and detail as the image data contained in each pixel 
isn’t scalable.
Choosing grayscale
Sometimes you may want to scan in your original line art as a grayscale image. 
Grayscale means exactly what it sounds like, an image absent of color done in 
a range of gray shades. Most of the time this is best suited for photographs 
and not line art. However, in some situations you may choose to first scan in 

280
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
your work in grayscale. For example, if you draw your cartoons using an old-
fashioned shading material like Zip-a-tone or Duoshade, you want to scan in 
your art as a grayscale. If you were to scan in these products using the bitmap 
setting, the art would appear as dark line art and would fail to pick up on any 
of the gray or shading elements.
However, if your line art is a simple black-and-white drawing with no shading 
or color, your best choice is to scan in your artwork as a bitmap and convert 
into grayscale afterwards. If you scan in your black-and-white line art as gray-
scale, the blacks may appear as dark gray and the line work may appear a 
little fuzzy.
The main reason you scan in line art as a bitmap is so it picks up the black 
lines in a nice crisp fashion. However, you can’t do things to the drawing 
while it’s in bitmap mode. You must then convert it to another mode format.
Moving into color: Comparing RGB and CMYK
Before you can begin to color your artwork, you must convert it from bitmap 
to grayscale and then to a color mode. You may wonder why you can’t save 
it directly into a color mode. In order to ensure that your line art is crisp and 
true black, you must scan it in first as a bitmap. If you scanned it in directly 
as a color file, the line art would appear dark gray and the file would prob-
ably be too big to work on without using up too much of your computer’s 
memory.
Also, Photoshop doesn’t allow you to color your files or create layers until 
your file is changed from a bitmap to a color mode.
You have two basic color modes to choose from: 
 
✓ RGB: RGB is an abbreviation for Red, Green, and Blue. Display devices 
generally use this color model. One of the most difficult aspects of desk-
top publishing in color is color matching — properly converting the RGB 
colors into CMYK colors so that what gets printed looks the same as 
what appears on the monitor.
 
✓ CMYK: CMYK is an abbreviation for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. 
CMYK is a color model in which all colors are a mixture of these four 
process colors. CMYK is the standard color model used in offset printing 
for full-color images. Because such printing uses inks of these four basic 
colors, it’s often called four-color printing.
 
If the image you create in Photoshop will ultimately be printed, it’s best to 
create it in CMYK. To do so, look at Figure 15-2 for direction. CMYK is best for 
art that needs to be color separated, like a T-shirt design, for example. RGB is 
good for files that will be viewed only on the Web.

Getting a Grasp on Photoshop Basics
Drawing your cartoon is the first step; scanning it into the computer is the 
second. Step three is using a computer program, such as Photoshop, to trans-
form your cartoon by cropping, editing, enhancing, lightening, darkening, 
shading, adding color, or just about any other editing graphic you can think 
of. Because Photoshop is by far the best program for working with digitalized 
art, I focus the rest of this chapter on using Photoshop. 
Photoshop is a graphics editing program produced by Adobe that you down-
load to your computer. (For a book full of information, check out the latest 
version of Photoshop CS4 For Dummies by Peter Bauer, published by Wiley.) 
This section gives you an overview of the important features of Photoshop 
and how to turn your black-and-white sketched drawing into a full-color digi-
talized masterpiece.
Becoming acquainted with your toolbar
Figuring out how to use Photoshop starts with a thorough understanding of 
all the features it contains. After you open your cartoon in Photoshop, several 
control panels appear on your desktop, one of which is long and narrow. 
This toolbar (see Figure 15-3) is full of features that are helpful for cartoon-
ists. To be able to fully utilize Photoshop and all its bells and whistles and 
to get the most out of the program, you need to familiarize yourself with this 
toolbar. Here are the main tools and what they do:

282
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
 
1. Burn tool: Darkens an image. To use this tool, just drag it over the 
image.
 
2. Cropping tool: This tool changes the size of the image. To use, select 
the area you want to crop and then press enter.
 
3. Dodge tool: The Dodge tool lightens an image. To use, drag the icon 
over the image you want to lighten.
 
4. Eraser tool: This can erase part of the photo in a certain layer. To erase 
everything in a certain area to make it white, flatten the image or go 
through every layer to delete that part. 
 
5. Eyedropper tool: Samples a color from the picture, color swatches, or 
the color picker. To use, click on the color on the image you want to 
take and right-click. 
 
6. Hand tool: Moves around an image within an object. Use with the Zoom 
tool when you want to adjust the section of picture you want to look at. 
 
7. Lasso tool: The Lasso tool can select areas within a layer that can’t be 
reached with the Marquee tool. 
 
8. Magic Wand tool: The Magic Wand is an automatic selection tool. It 
selects everything in the layer. 
 
9. Marquee tool: This is a group of tools that allows you to select rectan-
gles, ellipses, and 1-pixel rows and columns. 
 
10. Move tool: This tool moves around all objects within a layer. To move 
an entire image, flatten the layers by selecting Layer, then scroll to 
Flatten Image. 
 
11. Paint Bucket tool: Makes an area one color. To edit all layers at one 
time, click on All Layers at the top of the window. 
 
12. Pen tool: The Pen tool makes lines and can be used with shape tools 
to create different shapes. To create lines, use the Pen tool to create 
anchors (the little boxes on a line) and change the shape of the line by 
moving around the anchors. 
 
13. Pencil tool and Brush tool: Draws or paints a line. Same as the Pencil 
or Brush tool in Paint. Change the color of the paintbrush by clicking on 
the color picker. 
 
14. Sponge tool: The Sponge tool soaks color out of the image. Drag the tool 
over the section of the image you want to change to use.
 
15. Type tool: Puts text in a picture. Click on the picture with the Type tool 
and select a box the size of the area you want to add text. Type in the box, 
then adjust the size of the text box. 
 
16. Zoom tool: Zooms in on part of the picture for closer editing.

Cleaning up your artwork 
Before you can color your cartoons, you need to whip them into shape. This 
may involve cleaning up pencil lines that show up after you scan in your line 
art, or perhaps moving elements of the cartoon around to make a better com-
position. These things are easy to do when you know what tools work best to 
accomplish this.
The tools on the toolbar can save you time and create a better looking car-
toon in a number of ways. The toolbar has many helpful tools. I focus on a 
few of the primary and most helpful basic tools in this section.

284
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
The Eraser tool: Cleaning up your art digitally
One of the great things about working with art in the digital age is that you 
can modify your art using the computer in ways you never could before. The 
ability to modify your artwork on the computer helps produce clean, crisp 
art. The Eraser tool in Photoshop is one of these great tools that make your 
job a lot easier.
After you scan in your artwork you may find smudges, smeared lines, or 
other imperfections in your line art. These types of imperfections have a way 
of becoming even more noticeable when the art is reprinted, at which point 
it’s too late to clean it up.
The old way of cleaning up your art required you to erase all your pencil 
lines after the ink dried so that these small lines wouldn’t show up when your 
cartoon was reprinted. Typically, a cartoonist would sketch out the drawing 
with light pencil lines and then move to the final phase of the drawing known 
as inking. Using the light pencil sketch as a guide, the artist would either take 
a pen, nib, or brush and go over the pencil lines, creating a nice crisp final 
drawing.
After the ink dried, the cartoonist would erase the light pencil lines. Artists 
have done this for several hundred years of newsprint production, and it 
generally works pretty well, except for the following problems:
 
✓ It can be messy with all the little shavings that are produced as a result 
of the erasing.
 
✓ You may get some ink smearing. 
 
✓ You risk lightening up the art by causing your inked lines to fade.
 
✓ It can take some time to get rid of all the pencil lines depending on the 
complexity of your drawing.
Using the Eraser tool effectively can streamline the process of cleaning up 
your art. One thing that I suggest is to use a nonphoto blue pencil for sketch-
ing instead of using a dark pencil. Anything drawn with nonphoto blue pencil 
isn’t picked up by the scanner, and you won’t have to waste time erasing 
anything.
To use the Eraser tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the toolbar icon that looks like an eraser, as in Figure 15-4.
 
 Doing so changes your cursor into an eraser. 
 
2. Adjust the size or diameter of the tool to very large or very small.

285
 Chapter 15: Cartooning in the Digital Age
 
 If you have a lot of erasing to do, you may need to enlarge your Eraser 
tool so that it covers more area. To do this, choose the diameter setting 
from the brush palette. You can either choose one of the sizes listed or 
create your own size by manually adjusting the diameter size by moving 
the size adjusting arrow up or down.
 
3. Erase any unwanted lines, spots, or other imperfections that aren’t 
supposed to be part of the original art.

The Lasso tool: Moving or scaling an image
One great thing about Photoshop is that it allows you to edit and change 
your art in ways that would have proved nearly impossible before. The Lasso 
tool is an example. This tool icon looks like a rope lasso, and it allows you to 
literally lasso part of the art and move it around (see Figure 15-5).
Before this tool was available, cartoonists had to white out the area they 
wanted changed and redraw it, or physically cut it out and glue or tape it in 
the new area. With the Lasso tool you never have to do that again.

286
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
 
Figure 15-5: 
The Lasso 
tool can 
help you 
adjust the 
composition 
for a better 
cartoon.
 
Say you hand-draw and scan in your line art. You then decide you want to 
move one of the characters or objects over to the right of the composition a 
little more. To do so, just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Lasso tool and use it to draw a line around whatever it is 
that you want to move.
 
 After you complete a circle around the area you want moved, the lasso 
is formed, and it flickers as if to appear highlighted.
 
2. Drag your lasso to any other area in the drawing. 
 
3. Click the mouse.
 
 The lasso disappears and the object stays in its new location.
You can also adjust the size or scale of part of the drawing using the Lasso 
tool.
 
1. Draw your lasso around the area you want to manipulate.
 
2. Go to the menu bar under Edit and scroll down to Transform. 
 
3. Under Transform, select Scale; a box appears around the area that you 
previously lassoed. 

287
 Chapter 15: Cartooning in the Digital Age
 
4. Move your cursor so that it touches one of the corners of the box. 
 
5. Scale the art bigger by moving the corner out or smaller by moving 
the corner in (see Figure 15-6).

ing feature

Coloring and Shading in Photoshop
One of the great benefits of using Photoshop is that it allows you to color and 
shade your artwork right on screen. After you clean and size your artwork, 
you’re ready to color it. You won’t believe how your cartoons come to life 
when you add color to them! This section walks you through how to color 
and shade your cartoons in Photoshop.
Converting your bitmap file
Before you can jump in and start coloring your artwork, you first need to take 
a few steps after you scan in your cartoon. As I mention in the “Selecting a 
Photoshop mode: Bitmap, grayscale, RGB, and CMYK” section earlier in this 
chapter, you need convert the bitmap file to grayscale if you haven’t already 
done so. To convert the file, follow these easy steps:
 
1. Select Image on menu bar.
 
2. Scroll down to Mode.
 
3. Select Grayscale. Grayscale mode allows you to work in layers, so you 
can color and edit different parts of your cartoon independently of each 
other. You must convert the mode from bitmap to grayscale because the 
layers features don’t work in bitmap mode.

288
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
Working in layers
One of the unique things about Photoshop is the ability to work in layers. 
Each layer in a Photoshop document is a separate image that you can edit 
apart from any other layer (think of a layer as an image on a sheet of clear 
material). Together, all the layers form a stack of images. Layers allow you to 
break up each color step so you can work on it individually. With layers you 
can separate your cartoon into as many layers as you want. When you need 
to make small changes to the cartoon, you don’t have to disturb any of the 
other sections. 
When you scan in a black-and-white cartoon, it’s scanned in as a single image, 
comprised of the black line art as well as the white background. To prepare 
your cartoon to work in color and to use layers, follow these steps:
 
1. Use the Lasso tool and draw around the entire cartoon.
 
2. Select Edit from the menu bar.
 
3. Scroll down to Cut, then Paste. 
 
4. The cartoon reappears as a new layer.
 
5. Select the Magic Wand tool from the toolbar.
 
6. Click on any white area on the cartoon.
 
7. White areas become highlighted.
 
8. Hit the delete button on the keyboard.
 
9. White areas disappear, and only the black-and-white line art “frame” 
remains.
 
10. Make sure you’ve converted the mode from grayscale to CMYK by 
selecting Image on the menu bar, then scrolling down to CMYK.
 
11. Select Layer from the menu bar and scroll down to New. A new layer 
appears and now you can begin to color your cartoon.
You can create additional layers underneath the image so that everything 
is created from behind the black-and-white frame. To add new layers select 
Layer from the menu bar and scroll down to New. New layers appear, and 
now you can begin to color your cartoon (see Figure 15-7).
Another way to look at the layering process is to compare it to the way that 
traditional, classically-animated movies were created. The traditional anima-
tion process follows these steps:
 
1. The lead cartoonist creates the basic character design.
 
2. He passes it on to another artist who tightens the image. 

289
 Chapter 15: Cartooning in the Digital Age
 
3. The next guy inks over the sketch onto clear acetate.
 
4. The final artist flips the image in reverse so that he can color the image 
from behind to preserve the inked lines on top.
 
Figure 15-7: 
Layers allow 
you to work 
on different 
aspects 
of your 
drawing 
separately.
 
Line art layer
Highlight layer
Shading layer
Color layer
Each of these processes is a layer, including the process by which they color 
each cel. A cel is an individual frame in an animated movie. Each cel is hand-
painted and separate from the other cels.
When you scan your black-and-white cartoons into Photoshop, you can color 
the art in very much the same way as the animators do when working on a 
movie. You can actually separate your coloring process into as many layers 
as you want, so that you can get as detailed and specific as you want.
You can create additional layers underneath the image so that everything is 
created from behind the black-and-white frame. 
You manage layers with the Layers palette feature. The Layers palette dis-
plays a thumbnail view of each layer to help identify it. The appearance of a 
Photoshop document is a view of the layer stack from the top down. When 
you want to change something, you can go to that specific layer and change 
it without affecting the other areas, as in Figure 15-8.
The Layers palette (see Figure 15-9) displays a thumbnail view of each layer 
to help identify it. The appearance of a Photoshop document is a view of the 
layer stack from the top down. When you want to change something, you go 
to that specific layer and change it without affecting the other areas. 
For example, if you have a character whose shirt is colored brown, you may 
designate an individual layer just for the shirt and name it “shirt.” If you decide 
to change the shirt color, simply go to the Layers palette, select the “shirt” 
layer, and make the change you want. No erasing or Wite-Out necessary!

Coloring with Photoshop tools
Photoshop has several tools that make coloring your cartoon a breeze. The 
following are the three primary coloring tools. I recommend you begin with 
the Brush tool, because after you start coloring your cartoons, this is the tool 
you’ll probably use the most.
 
✓ The Brush tool: This tool applies color to your document, similar to the 
way a traditional paintbrush would apply paint on paper or canvas. You 
choose different brush options by selecting a brush size and shape from 
the brush palette. The edges of the lines created when using the brush 
tend to be slightly softer that that of other tools, mimicking a real brush.

291
 Chapter 15: Cartooning in the Digital Age
 
✓ The Pencil tool: The Pencil tool behaves much like the brush except 
that it has hard edges. The Pencil tool options are basically the same as 
the Brush tool.
 
✓ The Airbrush tool: The Airbrush tool works more like a traditional air-
brush or spray paint. The Airbrush tool puts paint on a bit lighter than 
the Brush tool, but when you hold your mouse button down without 
moving the cursor, the paint builds up, just like it would if you were to 
hold the nozzle down on a can of spray paint (see Figure 15-10).

Pencil, and

tools are

the coloring 
process.
 
Shading and highlighting with 
the Burn and Dodge tools 
Other features you can use in the Photoshop toolbar allow you to add ele-
ments of lighting and shadow into flat art images. The Burn tool and the 
Dodge tool are both designed to help you accomplish this in a realistic and 
believable way.
Burning an image with the Burn tool darkens an area, while dodging an image 
with the Dodge tool lightens the area. You can see how these two tools can 
add shading and highlighting and give a 2-D image a 3-D effect by noticing the 
difference between the original image on the left and the one on the right (in 
Figure 15-11). These tools are great for adding highlights and shading to your 
art that give the impression of definition of shape as well as depth and dimen-
sion to your art.

Saving Your Work
After you clean your artwork and size it just the way you want, you need to 
save the file. Make sure you always have a master original. This master needs 
to be a file that’s unflattened, meaning all the layers are still open and you can 
go back and easily change elements of the cartoon. Save your master as a 
.psd file (the abbreviation for a Photoshop file). 
Remember: It’s a good idea to be saving and backing up your work as you go. 
This will prevent your losing hours and hours of work if something happens 
like your hard drive freezing up or your losing power. This way when you 
restore the computer your file is ready for you right where you left off.
In addition to your master file, which can be changed at any time, you also 
need to save a finished, flattened copy. You do this in the following way:
 
1. Select Layers on the Photoshop toolbar.
 
2. Scroll down to and select Flatten to flatten the file.
 
3. Save the flattened file in another format such as .tif, JPEG, or PDF.
Several files types are commonly used to save artwork. Here are some advan-
tages and disadvantages of each:
 
✓ TIFF: TIFF is an abbreviation for Tagged Image File Format and it’s the 
best choice for saving your cartoons. You can save black-and-white, 
grayscale, or RGB and CMYK color files using TIFF. TIFF image files 
optionally use LZW lossless compression. Lossless means there is no 
quality loss due to file compression. Lossless guarantees nothing will be 
lost or altered when your files are compressed. Although TIFF files can 
be large compared to other formats, TIFF files generally offer the best 
print reproduction for your line art or color files.
 
✓ JPEG: There’s a lot of confusion over JPEG files. You should use JPEGS 
for photographs and not line art, because unlike TIFFs, JPEGs use lossy 

293
 Chapter 15: Cartooning in the Digital Age
compression, which means that some visual quality is lost in the process 
and can’t be restored. I’m often asked to send my art to someone as a 
JPEG for one of usually two reasons:
 
• The person is on a PC and can’t open a TIFF file. Most PCs aren’t 
graphic-friendly compared to Apple computers. 
 
• It’s also possible that they don’t know anything about printing 
graphics reproduction, because if they did, they would know JPEGs 
are meant for photographs. 
 
 Nevertheless, for people who want to simply view the art on their PC, 
I send them a JPEG file to review. However, if your art is going to be 
printed, line art or color cartoons should never be JPEGs; they should 
be TIFF or PDF files.
 
✓ PDF: PDF is an abbreviation for Portable Document Format. A PDF is a 
file that allows electronic information to be transferred between various 
types of computers. The software which allows this transfer is called 
Acrobat. To view and print a PDF file you first need to download and 
install a copy of the Adobe Acrobat Reader.
 
✓ GIF: GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. The overwhelming 
majority of images on the Web are now in GIF format, and virtually 
all Web browsers that support graphics can display GIF files. GIF files 
incorporate a compression scheme to keep file sizes to a minimum, and 
they’re limited to 8-bit (256 or fewer colors) color palettes, which trans-
lates to the lowest color option and isn’t optimal for full-color printing. 
As a result, files that are meant for print should never be GIF files. Only 
files that are for Web display only should be GIF files. 
 
✓ EPS: EPS, which stands for Encapsulated PostScript, is a standard file 
format for importing and exporting PostScript files. Because an EPS file 
can contain any combination of text, graphics, and images, it’s a very 
versatile file format. You can visualize the content of EPS files easily 
because they contain a small preview image. This is done so that appli-
cations don’t need a PostScript interpreter to display the content of the 
EPS file. Even office applications such as Microsoft Word can display the 
preview image.
E-Mailing Your Art Files
Formatting your files correctly for e-mailing is just as important as saving 
them in the right format. If you’re working in Photoshop or another art pro-
gram, your finished file may be quite large, especially if you use lots of layers 
or filters, even after you flatten the file. 
If your file is large, you can attempt to e-mail it as is, but many e-mail provid-
ers have limits as to how big a file can be. (Think of it as having created a 
beautiful piece of furniture, only to discover that it won’t fit through your 

294
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
door!) Furthermore, it may take a long time to upload a file if it’s too big. The 
best remedy for this is to reduce the size of your file before you e-mail it by 
using one of the following programs:
 
✓ STUFFIT: Files that use this program are compressed and have a .sit 
or .sitx file extension. The StuffIt format is a modern archive format, 
designed to be extendable, support Mac OS X, Windows, and UNIX/Linux 
file platforms. Optimized compressors give it the edge for getting files 
as small as possible. Double-click on the attachment and the StuffIt 
program automatically opens the file.
 
✓ ZIP: Zip is a compression program common on both Windows and Mac 
OS X and is good for compressing files so that you can easily transfer 
them via e-mail. Double-click on the attachment and the Zip program 
automatically opens the file.
 
✓ FTP: Another popular method for transferring large, high-resolution art 
files is through FTP, or File Transfer Protocol. This is a direct transfer 
of files from your computer to another computer over the Internet. The 
advantage of FTP is that you can transfer very large files quickly.
The evolution of Photoshop
One of the first computer painting or drawing pro-
grams offered on Apple Macintosh computers 
was called MacPaint. This full-featured program 
went back to around 1984 and came bundled 
with other software on every Mac computer. 
MacPaint’s bitmap-based PICT file format was 
used for printing the screen.
MacPaint was significant because its ease of 
use — and often entertaining results — showed 
a novice audience what a GUI-based system 
could do. (GUI means Graphic User Interface, 
which is the graphics you look at on your com-
puter screen.) However, to draw with Mac 
Paint you had to use the mouse, and the results 
were very childlike at best. Early programs like 
MacPaint also had no practical application that 
would allow the artist to paint, color, or manipu-
late an existing drawing.
What left MacPaint in the dust was the intro-
duction of a program called Photoshop, created 
by the graphics software company Adobe. 
Photoshop is, hands down, the best program for 
creating and modifying images for the Web, and 
this includes cartoons. Photoshop is available 
for both Mac and Windows; its plusses include 
intuitiveness, a huge number of reference 
guides, and the most complete set of tools. The 
basic premise of Photoshop started as a thesis 
on the processing of digital images and evolved 
into a program named Display. In 1989, Adobe 
took interest in the program and released the 
first ever version of Photoshop to professionals 
in 1990.
After initially marketing Photoshop as a profes-
sional tool, Adobe created a consumer version 
which cost much less than its professional 
counterpart and was often bundled with other 
products like digital cameras and scanners.
Who uses Photoshop today? Everyone — just 
check out all the Photoshopped images on the 
Internet. Just about anyone can use Photoshop 
today, and many do, achieving imaging results 
once available only to professionals with high-
end advanced equipment.

I
 have some good news for you: You can make a living with cartooning. 
However, before you quit your day job, run out and buy supplies, and 
start sketching, realize that cartooning as a career isn’t for just anyone. You 
have to be really good, very persistent, in the right place at the right time, 
and good at marketing your cartoons. If you’re a beginning cartoonist, I sug-
gest you hold off on this pursuit for a while. Take the time to perfect your 
craft, get lots of feedback from friends, family, and online, and start slow.
However, if you’ve been drawing for quite some time and are confident in 
your cartoons and your ability, then you may want to see whether this hobby 
can become a vocation. Before you jump into anything, first take a deep 
breath and read this chapter. Here I look at what you have to do to make it 
into the big time, from preparing your work for submission to getting syndi-
cated, and I tell you how to keep the IRS satisfied if you start making money 
as a cartoonist. I also suggest you check out Chapter 18 for some other quick 
tips if you plan to pursue cartooning as a career.
Deciding to Go Full Time
Drawing cartoons can be a fun hobby, one you can enjoy for years. When 
you think about turning pro, however, just being good isn’t good enough. 
Becoming a professional cartoonist is like becoming a professional writer, 

296
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
actor, athlete, or musician. Cartooning is a nontraditional profession that can 
be a dream job for many, so the competition is tremendous. Getting even a 
foot in the door requires a lot of hard work, talent, and just the right timing.
You may notice I didn’t include “luck” on the list. I don’t put much stock in 
blind luck, and you shouldn’t, either. In reality, the kind of luck that most 
people find is the kind of luck where preparation meets opportunity. This 
simply means that you have to be well prepared for the right opportunity 
to come along and then take it. Opportunities rarely come knocking on your 
door; you need to go out and find them.
Preparing for those opportunities requires a lot of hard work and planning. 
No one becomes an overnight success overnight, but knowing where and 
how to start is half the battle. The next sections show you how.
Evaluating whether you 
can handle the career
If you’re contemplating becoming a professional cartoonist, you have many 
factors to consider. Most important, you need to look at yourself in the mirror 
and really ask yourself whether you can handle the pressures involved with 
a career in cartooning. Pressures, you say? How can drawing a three-panel 
cartoon be that difficult? Well, take it from me. Cartooning isn’t as easy as it 
looks. When you evaluate yourself, ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Can you draw this cartoon or comic strip for an extended period of 
time? Typically, a syndicate offers a new cartoonist a ten-year contract. 
That’s seven cartoons a week for ten years’ — ten years’ worth of daily 
deadlines that you can’t miss . . . yikes!
 
 Some people don’t want to plan ahead for what they’re doing next week, 
let alone ten years; are you sure you have ten years’ worth of ideas for 
your strip? No, you don’t have to have them all plotted out ten years in 
advance, but you have to be certain that your character will keep you 
interested enough to keep drawing it for the next ten years.
 
✓ Can you handle the pressure of a daily deadline? A deadline is like a 
bottomless pit; you have to keep feeding it new material and you can’t 
ever say enough is enough. Coming up with fresh new material is a vital 
part of being a good cartoonist and is often considered the hardest part 
of cartooning. If you feel confident that you have the passion and endur-
ance to go the distance, then the next step is to take a hard look at the 
quality of your work.
If these questions scare you, cartooning as a career may not be right for you. 
That’s okay. Cartooning can still be a great hobby, one you can enjoy and 
share with others. And a few years down the road, with a few thousand 

297
 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
cartoons under your belt, you may want to take another look at the possibil-
ity. Being a professional cartoonist isn’t a “one time offer” opportunity; you 
can try your hand at it at any time.
Looking for honest feedback
If your mom was like most, you probably grew up hearing how wonderful 
you are. Mom was probably your biggest cheerleader, telling everyone who 
would listen that her kid was going to be the next Charles Schulz. From a 
Parenting 101 standpoint, encouraging your kids in their artistic pursuits is 
one of the best things a parent can do. However, the downside of buying into 
mom’s beliefs is that you may have never done an honest evaluation of your 
work. Friends’ opinions don’t count, either. Because no one else is going to 
say it, you must say it to yourself: “Am I really good enough?”
Honestly evaluating your work is something you must do before you go any 
further with your desire to become a professional cartoonist. Take a long 
hard look at your drawing skills while asking yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Does your art look like it would be at home next to the other long-running 
strips that have been published in the newspapers over the last ten years?
 
✓ Can you draw in perspective?
 
✓ Can you letter well?
 
✓ Do the characters you create look professional?
 
✓ Does the tree you drew in panel #3 look like a tree?
Answering these questions honestly is important, because you need an 
accurate assessment of your abilities. Not being honest sets you up for big 
disappointment, not to mention some snickering if your work is amateurish. 
Just remember: Editors or syndicates are more than happy to tell you how 
bad you are! However, if you’re satisfied that you do have what it takes, get-
ting an unbiased third party to evaluate your work is the next logical step 
and always a good idea.
Checking with the professionals
Before you take the plunge and try to make a full-time career out of cartooning, 
I also suggest you show your work to other professionals to get their feedback. 
A professional cartoonist will probably have nice things to say about whatever 
you show them just to be polite, as well as to be encouraging to a fellow car-
toonist. However, professional cartoonists will probably also want to be honest 
with you, because they were once just starting out and can appreciate that 
honest, straightforward feedback is the best thing for you in the long run.

298
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
If you don’t know any professional cartoonists, look up contact information 
for your favorite cartoonist and call him up. Some have Web sites or blogs 
that make it easier to contact them. Cartoonists are often willing to talk to 
beginners and to chat about the cartooning field.
After you make contact, you can ask if it’s okay to put together samples of 
your work and mail it to him. Mailing is preferable to e-mailing because the 
files may be too big for his inbox, or may get caught in a spam filter. Mailing 
your work also makes it more likely that the professional cartoonist will real-
ize that you took the time to mail the big envelope, especially if you’ve made 
contact ahead of time. Additionally, your fellow cartoonist will have hard 
copies of your comics, which are always easier to read than trying to look at 
your work on a small computer screen.
Include a nice cover letter indicating you’re a huge fan of the cartoonist’s 
work and would love his opinion on yours. It’s also a good idea to include 
your contact info, because he may be motivated to get in touch with you, or 
to check out your Web site, if he sees something promising in your work.
Another way to get in contact with cartooning professionals is to join a pro-
fessional association. By joining as a student or associate member, the aspir-
ing cartoonist can network and make contacts with real live professionals. 
Chapter 18 has more details on professional organizations for cartoonists 
and how to join them.
Knowing the Market
Another important step to take when you’re considering being a professional 
cartoonist is to know how to market your work. When you’re starting your 
cartooning career, think of your work as a product, just like any other busi-
ness would. When car companies introduce a new automobile they first do 
extensive research, testing, and marketing. You need to do the same before 
introducing your work to the public.
You have two avenues to pursue when marketing your work: starting with 
your area papers or sending your work to a national syndicate, which, 
despite the somewhat negative connotation of the word, is a company that 
agrees to distribute and sell your work to national and local newspapers and 
magazines. This section helps you determine what initial research you need 
to do when marketing your work and then discusses these two avenues.
Doing your initial research
In order to market your work, you need to know what you’re getting into and 
who you’re competing against. Make sure you carefully research the following:

299
 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
 
✓ The market you’re aiming for: Where you want your cartoon to be 
picked up can help you decide what type of product to pitch. Certain 
types of cartoons only appear in certain media. Comic strips are mar-
keted to newspapers and Web sites, editorial cartoons to newspapers 
for their editorial pages, and gag panel cartoons can be marketed to 
magazines like The New Yorker.
 
✓ Your competition: Remember that your local newspaper probably 
doesn’t carry all the strips available on the market, so you may have to 
search the Internet to get a good idea of all the comic strips out there to 
see who you’re going up against.
 
 Looking at what’s in the market currently also gives you an idea of 
what’s not out there. If you’ve got a great idea for a comic strip and 
you see that nothing is out there to compete against, then the syndi-
cates may be interested in filling a hole in the market with your feature. 
However, if your cartoon is about a lazy, sarcastic cat that eats spaghetti 
and has a dimwitted sidekick dog, by doing the research you can see 
there may not be a market for your work because a similar cartoon 
already exists.
 
 On the flip side however, syndicates tend to do the same thing that TV 
programmers do; they market “new” products that are very similar to 
programs with a proven track record. How many comic strips feature a 
family and a dog or a cat? How many comic strips have you seen over 
the years that have kids as the main characters? How about talking ani-
mals? Syndicates may reject your idea if it’s too cutting edge because 
they’re looking for something more conventional. The bottom line is to 
try and create something that appeals to you that’s also marketable, and 
if that sounds easy, rest assured that it’s not.
Starting locally
One way to sell your work and at the same time test-market it is to sell it 
locally. Contact your local newspaper features editor by putting together 
a professional sample package and mailing it to her with a cover letter. 
Emphasize the fact that you’re a local resident in your cover letter; local 
newspapers love to showcase local talent and know that a locally drawn 
comic strip appeals to readers.
Successfully getting your comic strip into a local newspaper helps you in 
three important ways:
 
✓ It teaches you what it’s like to have a daily or weekly deadline that you 
must meet.
 
✓ It helps you build a portfolio of work that you can use when you decide 
to try for a syndicate contract.
 
✓ It gives your work credibility, because it proves you’re publishable.

300
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
Another great way to get started if you happen to be a college student is to 
join your college newspaper. Many, many cartoonists begin their careers by 
becoming part of their college paper; it’s a great way to gain experience with 
deadlines and get published — and to get used to having your work criticized!
Selling to the syndicates
You may decide to skip the small town papers and go right for the national 
market, or you may approach the national market after you’ve built up your 
portfolio locally. To get your work widely published, you need to be syn-
dicated. Syndication is the distribution of your work to paying customers 
throughout the country. A syndicate company agrees to distribute and sell 
your work in return for a share in the money.
The United States has about a dozen major syndicates, and most of them 
handle comic strips, along with columns and other specialty features. Some 
of the major syndicates are United Media, Universal Press, Creators, Scripps 
Howard News Service, King Features, Tribune Media, and the Washington 
Post Writers Group. You can do a quick Internet search to locate each com-
pany’s Web site, which contains more information about them, as well as the 
current comics that each is currently promoting.
Because syndicates are in the business of selling comics to subscribing pub-
lications, they’re always willing to look at new comic features for possible 
syndication. It’s the ultimate dream of many cartoonists to get syndicated 
throughout the world and get paid truckloads of cash, not to mention becom-
ing famous. But it’s also very difficult to achieve, particularly these days, as 
circulation numbers drop and newspapers and magazines cut back on the 
amount of outside material they purchase.
Many syndicates face difficulties finding clients for cartoonists they already 
represent, never mind taking on new clients. However, you never know if 
your product is the right thing at the right time unless you try over and over 
again. Getting through the syndicate maze requires a bit of know-how, which 
I provide in the next sections.
For more information on how to contact a syndicate, check out Chapter 18.
Grasping How Syndication Works
Everyone — well, your mom at least — tells you you’re ready for the big time, 
but how do you even begin to market cartoons or comics? Before you get 
ready to send your art out the door, you need to understand syndication and 
the ways that syndicates rule the modern cartooning world.

301
 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
Syndication works like this:
 
1. You, the aspiring cartoonist, draw a month’s worth of comic strips and 
submit them to the dozen or so major syndicates in the country.
 
2. The submission arrives at the syndicate’s office in New York, where it 
goes into a pile with the rest of the ten to fifteen thousand other sub-
missions the syndicate receives each year.
 
3. Submissions editors go through the stacks and review each submis-
sion, looking for the next great marketable comic strip.
 
4. After they spot a promising submission, they pass it up the chain to 
the other editors who also review it.
 
 During their review, they look for several things in order of importance:
 
• Is it well written?
 
• Is it well drawn?
 
• Is it similar to another feature already in syndication?
 
• Can we market this feature effectively?
 
5. The big kahuna editors choose their final picks.
 
6. After many months you may receive a letter (or phone call, if you’re 
really lucky) from an editor. This letter could say several things:
 
• Thanks but no thanks. Otherwise known as a rejection letter, this 
means they either didn’t like your work or don’t have a place for it 
on their list.
 
• No thanks, but keep trying. If they see something that needs work, 
they may express that in the rejection letter, encouraging you to 
try and improve these things and resubmit at a later date. Any 
personal comment or note is a positive sign that your work has 
promise, so really up your effort if you get any type of personal 
response.
 
• Let’s work on it. They could also agree to a development deal 
where they offer you a contract to help you improve areas in the 
comic strip, in the hope that after the end of the development 
period the strip is ready to market. If during the development 
period you show no improvement, then they’ll pass on the strip at 
the end of this period.
 
• You’ve got a deal! Congratulations, you’ve broken into one of the 
toughest businesses around!
If the syndicate picks up your cartoon, the development process begins. 
You’ll work with an editor to help ready your strip for publication. This 
process may include suggestions on writing or small changes to the art. 
Some cartoons are perfect and require no changes at all — don’t count on it, 
though! Editors live to change things.

302
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
When the strip is ready for publication, the syndicate offers you a contract 
and sets a launch date. It’s the syndicate’s job at this point to begin market-
ing and selling the strip to the newspapers. The syndicate usually wants 
around 50 sales before launching the strip, although this number is different 
for each individual syndicate. For more info about a syndicate giving you the 
thumbs-up, check out the “Welcome to success (but don’t expect millions)” 
section later in this chapter.
Creating a Winning Submission Package
Standing out from the competition starts with your first submission package. 
A syndicate may get ten to fifteen thousand submissions a year; they wade 
through looking for the gem in the rock pile, the comic strip they feel is mar-
ketable and potentially profitable, for you and them. Out of all the submis-
sions each syndicate may receive a year, only about a half dozen are selected 
for syndication, not great odds. Your chances of winning the lottery are a 
little lower, but not much. In order to make your submission rise to the top, I 
offer some suggestions in this section.
 
When you mail your submission package, resist the urge to get cute; dancing 
delivery girls, balloons, and twenty dollar bills won’t increase your odds of 
having your submission accepted! Send in a professional looking, typed (not 
handwritten) cover letter, and make sure to cover the postage — a postage 
due submission is sure to end up in the post office’s dead letter section.
Attaching a straightforward cover letter
One of the most important pieces to include in your submission package 
is a clear, straightforward cover letter. A simple, businesslike, professional 
resume and cover letter do more to impress a syndicate editor than a coco-
nut that needs to be hammered open and contains your 400 original samples 
of a comic strip about a group of island castaways. I would venture to guess 
there’s a 100 percent chance that that coconut will go right into the trash, 
with your submission still in it.
 
The cover letter is where you can concisely tell the recipient about you and 
your intentions for writing for them. When writing your cover letter, don’t try 
to be overly clever. Briefly introduce yourself and tell a little bit about your 
feature. Keep it simple and professional; let your work sell itself.

303
 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
Choosing samples of your work
In addition to a professional cover letter and resume, you need to send good 
clean samples showcasing the best examples of your work. Think of your 
submission as a long distance job interview; you want to impress them with 
your professionalism and show them you’re qualified. Obviously, choose 
samples that represent your very best work. This may be a one-time shot, so 
you have to put your best foot forward. You may want to show your samples 
around to friends and family to get their feedback, especially if you have 
friends and family who work in the cartooning business! If not, send only 
samples that get a universally positive response — a halfhearted chuckle or 
“huh” isn’t a positive response!
 
When putting together your sample portfolio, keep the following two points 
in mind:
 
✓ The number of submissions: Most syndicates want to see a month’s 
worth of daily strips, which equates to 24 black-and-white samples. 
This number breaks down to six days a week for four weeks to be 24 
black-and-white dailies. Additionally, you need to send two Sunday color 
samples as well.
 
✓ The size of submissions: Each sample needs to be proportional so that 
when it’s reduced it will be the correct size. Most comic strip cartoon-
ists draw their daily comic strips 13 inches wide by 4 inches tall. Most 
single-panel cartoonists draw their daily panel 7 inches wide by 7 inches 
tall, not counting the extra space for the caption placed underneath the 
drawing. You can draw larger or smaller than that, as long as your car-
toons are in proportion to those sizes. The reproduction of your work is 
very important to the syndicates so don’t overlook this.
 
 Make sure the copies you send are clear and that the word balloons are 
easy to read without squinting. If they have to squint to read your work, 
then it goes in the garbage. Reduce your comics to fit onto standard 
8 1/2-x-11-inch sheets of paper.
Include your name, address, and phone number on each page. Remember, 
don’t send your original drawings! Send clean copies instead. If you want 
your work back be sure and send a SASE so they can return it to you.
Dealing with the Ups and Downs
After you mail your submission to each of the syndicates, you can expect to 
hear back from them in about 12 weeks or so. Rest assured that these will 
be the longest 12 weeks of your entire life. Don’t just sit around waiting to 

304
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
hear, or assume that you can stop working now that you’ve got your stuff out 
there. Keep working; you may be amazed (or dismayed) to see how much 
your work improves over the 12-week waiting period.
Getting picked up by a syndicate isn’t easy, and you’re probably going to 
face a lot of rejection. Part of making a career out of cartooning is that you’re 
going to experience many upswings and downswings in your career. This sec-
tion helps you handle the pendulum.
Coping with rejection
There’s a strong chance that you’ll receive a form letter saying “thanks but 
no thanks.” Remember that the odds are against you; you’re in good com-
pany if you’ve collected enough rejection letters to wallpaper your walls. 
Prepare yourself for rejection and accept it as part of doing business. The 
important thing is not to get discouraged and depressed about it; use it as a 
motivator to produce something bigger and better the next time around.
Rejection and failure can be a good character builder in more ways than one. 
For example, when the legendary cartoonist Bill Watterson submitted his first 
comic strip about cute little bugs, it was rejected across the board by all the 
major syndicates. Watterson took the opportunity to reevaluate his idea and 
come up with something totally new . . . and that was Calvin and Hobbes.
So if they do reject what you sent them, what do you do next? This may 
depend on why they rejected you. Often times the syndicates send a little note 
along with the form letter indicating why they’re not accepting your comic 
strip. Some rejection letters may give you pointers on correcting small things 
or improving your art or lettering. It would be wise to take whatever advice 
you can get and follow it; consider any advice to be an encouraging sign — 
many people just get the form letter without even a real signature on it!
The syndicates may indicate that they rejected your idea because they have 
too many current features that are just like the one you submitted. They may 
indicate that they like some aspects of your idea but not others. Or they may 
not say anything at all. At this point you have two choices:
 
✓ Revise what you submitted and come up with a new story line using 
the same characters. Many cartoonists need to revise and polish story 
lines several times over before hitting on an idea that resonates with edi-
tors. If you love your characters, keep trying out new ideas until you find 
something that strikes a positive chord with editors. Even Bill Watterson 
(the creator of Calvin and Hobbes) had to revise his story lines several 
times before having his strip accepted by Universal.

305
 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
 
✓ Scrap the whole concept and come up with something totally new 
with completely new characters. If you’re in love with your characters, 
this can be really hard to do; you become emotionally invested in your 
creations and hate to kill them off, so to speak. But if an editor indicates 
that you have great ideas but unappealing characters, let them go, and 
work on developing characters that mesh better with your story lines.
Which route you take depends on how attached to the original idea you are. 
Some people can’t bear to give up the characters they’ve developed and have 
grown emotionally attached to — they’re like family! However, you’re in busi-
ness to get published and make a living, and sometimes you have to drop 
what doesn’t work and come up with a fresh approach.
Welcome to success (but don’t expect much)
On the other hand, if the syndicate likes what you sent, it may offer you a 
contract to create the strips on a regular basis. If you receive this special 
goodness in the mail, then accept my congratulations! Remember that you’re 
one of the few to reach this point. However, you’re not going to be making 
tons of money. The contract usually offers a 50/50 split between the cartoon-
ist and the syndicate. Fifty percent of your income may seem excessive, but 
syndicates do a lot to earn their half.
To earn its 50 percent, the syndicate edits, packages, promotes, prints, sells, 
and distributes your comic strip to newspapers and Web sites around the 
world. Basically, a syndicate is responsible for bringing the cartoons from the 
hand of the cartoonist to the eyes of the public.
The more papers that pick up the strip, the bigger the client list and the 
more revenue the strip generates. After it becomes established at around 100 
papers, the syndicate may decide to publish a book or look at other forms of 
marketing.
If the strip gets really popular, the syndicate may consider other forms of 
merchandising, like toys. After a strip hits the 1000 mark, it has the potential 
to start earning big money both from syndicate revenues and potential market-
ing and merchandising possibilities like TV shows or movies.
If you’re fortunate enough to get a contract, you can expect to make between 
$25,000 and $1,500,000 a year. It all depends on how many newspapers sub-
scribe to your comic strip and how many products and licensing deals are 
made from your characters. It’s a real safe bet that you’ll probably be much, 
much closer to the lower end of the scale than the higher. However, if your 
strip or comic characters are successful, then you can make serious money. 
Charles Schulz, creator of the Peanuts cartoons, made $35 million last year 
and he’s been dead for over eight years!

Turning Your Hobby into a Business
Deciding to turn your hobby into a money making (hopefully) business is 
more complicated than sending out a few submissions. Although immedi-
ate financial success is unlikely, you have to be prepared for the possibility 
by having a business plan and an understanding of the legal steps you must 
follow in order to keep Uncle Sam, and more importantly, the IRS happy. Are 
you wondering why? The IRS defines being self-employed or starting your 
own business as an attempt to make a profit. Turning a profit is the primary 
distinction between a hobby and a business.
This section shows you how to take care of basic small business fundamen-
tals, from forming your own company to the very important step of managing 
your taxes.
Comprehending copyrights
Contracts are legal and binding documents, 
so don’t sign one without reading it — all of it, 
even the incomprehensible, boring parts. Get a 
lawyer to review it if you’re not sure just what 
you’re signing. Make sure that you understand 
who owns the copyright to your work. In the old 
days (before 1988), it was routine for the syndi-
cates to own the feature they were syndicating. 
This was much like TV. The guy that created 
classic shows like Gilligan’s Island and The 
Brady Bunch was a producer named Sherwood 
Schwartz. Over the years he has made a fortune 
off of these shows as they have remained on TV 
through syndication since they were first cre-
ated in the early 1960s. By contrast, the actors 
who gave life to these shows with their distinc-
tive performances weren’t paid anything after 
the shows were cancelled and received no 
royalties from syndication.
This trend began to change in the late 1970s with 
shows like M*A*S*H. After several high profile 
actors threatened to strike, the show’s produc-
ers gave part ownership to the main actors in 
the show, which meant that they receive royal-
ties every time an old episode is shown, which 
has made them all quite wealthy.
It wasn’t until the late 1980s that this trend car-
ried over into the comic strip business. In the 
mid-1980s a new syndicate called Creators was 
started by several syndicate executives who 
left other companies. Creators gave the cartoon 
creators ownership in their characters. It was a 
big success and the ownership trend has now 
carried over to the other syndicates as well.
Today it’s common practice for new comic 
feature contracts to stipulate that the cartoon-
ist owns his feature and the characters he or 
she creates. It’s interesting to note that Charles 
Schulz didn’t own the copyright to Peanuts, 
which first became syndicated in the 1950s. 
By the time the trend changed, Snoopy and the 
gang had become the most popular comic strip 
of all time, earning an estimated one billion dol-
lars a year with all the numerous licensing and 
marketing deals.
Despite not owning the rights to Peanuts, Schulz 
still managed to make the highest paid celebri-
ties list each year, squeaking by on $35 million 
a year (his contract did state that no one else 
could draw the comic feature). However, by not 
owning the rights outright he had to sit by and 
watch $970 million go to someone else!

 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
Meeting the criteria to call 
yourself a business
Becoming a legal and legitimate business has many advantages for a profes-
sional cartoonist. Starting your own business requires a little work on your 
part but it’s well worth it, and the IRS actually requires that you do if you 
want to get paid. You can take the following steps to ensure you meet all the 
criteria:
 
1. Form a Limited Liability Company (LLC).
 
 Perhaps the most important thing you can do is form an LLC, or Limited 
Liability Company. An LLC is a business structure that combines the 
pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the 
limited liability of a corporation. LLC owners report business profits or 
losses on their personal income tax returns; the LLC itself is not a sepa-
rate taxable entity. This setup is a lot easier than a corporation, which is 
required to pay another separate set of taxes, and who wants that?
 
 One very important facet of LLCs is that the owners are protected from 
personal liability for business debts and claims — a feature known as 
limited liability. This means that if the business owes money or faces a 
lawsuit, only the assets of the business itself are at risk. Creditors usually 
can’t reach the personal assets of the LLC owners, such as a house or car. 
 
 Setting up your LLC can generally be done without a lawyer if you can 
read and follow instructions. In most states you start by contacting your 
state’s corporation commission. A quicker way may be to go to your 
state government’s Web site and download the necessary forms you 
need. The forms are called the Articles of Organization. The forms are 
usually fill-in-the-blank and easy to comprehend. You can also check out 
Limited Liability Companies For Dummies by Jennifer Reuting (published 
by Wiley).
 
2. Choose your company name.
 
 One of the most important things you’ll be asked for on the forms is 
what name you’ll be doing business under, so put some thought into this 
beforehand. You want to make sure that the name sounds professional 
and is related to the type of work you’ll be doing. If you’re at the corpora-
tion commission’s Web site, you may be able to search its database to 
see if there’s another business using the name you’ve selected. Generally, 
if there’s another LLC doing business under that name, you have to come 
up with a different one before you can become incorporated.
 
3. Publish your intention to form an LLC.
 
 A few states impose an additional requirement: Prior to filing your 
Articles of Organization, you must publish your intention to form an LLC 
in a local newspaper. Check with your state to see if this is required.

308
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
 
4. Submit your final paperwork.
 
 After you’ve published your Articles of Organization in your local paper 
(usually for three business days), you’re ready to submit your paper-
work for formal approval. This approval process is mostly a formality; 
you should become incorporated in less than 120 days.
 
5. After you’re legally incorporated you can apply to the IRS for a 
Federal Tax ID number, also called an Employer Identification 
Number, or EIN.
 
 To actually get an EIN number you need to go to the IRS Web site and 
download Form SS-4. A federal tax identification number is a number 
assigned solely to your business by the IRS. Your tax ID number is 
used to identify your business, and your clients will require it for their 
records so they can show the IRS that they paid you.
Keeping the IRS happy
After you form your LLC and you have your new tax ID number, you need to 
open up a business checking account. Having a business account can help 
you manage any monies that pass through your business, as well as keep 
track of any expenses you may want to deduct at tax time.
Banks usually require you to show them your Articles of Organization as 
proof of the business’s existence before opening the account. After the 
account is in place, you’ll have a place to cash and deposit all those checks 
you’ll be getting from the syndicate! Keeping your business income and expenses 
separate from your personal accounts is required by the IRS. You need to be 
able to prove which deductions are actual business expenses with receipts and 
documentation. Setting up a separate account for business income and expenses 
is the easiest way to do this — and hang on to your receipts!
Another thing you may want to consider is some sort of accounting software 
that helps you keep track of your income and expenses. You can get software 
that does everything you need for a small business, like QuickBooks, Quicken, 
or even Microsoft’s Money.
Maximizing deductions
Being in business means having to pay taxes. However, you’re legally allowed 
certain deductions for business expenses, and these can be a great benefit to 
you. Although the tax code changes from year to year, what you’re allowed to 
deduct in your business generally stays the same. Check with an accountant 
if you have any questions.

309
 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
I suggest you use an accountant to prepare both your personal and business 
returns, just to be safe. The good thing about using an accountant is the cost 
of having your tax returns prepared is also tax-deductible. Here are a few 
other deductions to keep in mind when doing business:
 
✓ Start-up costs: Any money you spent starting your business is deductible.
 
✓ Vehicle use: The government allows you to deduct certain expenses for 
business vehicles, including mileage.
 
✓ Equipment deductions: In addition to the paper and pens you buy to 
draw with, that new computer you bought to scan and color your car-
toons is deductible!
 
✓ Entertainment deductions: If you wined and dined the executives at the 
syndicate, then that may be deductible, usually at 50 percent.
 
✓ Travel expenses: If you traveled to a cartoonist convention, then those 
expenses may be deductible.
 
✓ Membership fees in a professional organization: If you pay dues 
they’re generally deductible.
 
✓ Advertising costs: Costs for advertising your business are tax-
deductible. These may include print, Internet/Web site costs, or 
other ad forms like business cards.
 
✓ Legal fees: Businesses often consult lawyers about business matters or 
to review contracts. The fees charged are deductible.
 
✓ Software deductions: Small businesses can deduct the cost of software 
purchased for exclusive use by the business.
 
✓ Home office deduction: If you draw from your home, and most cartoon-
ists do, you’re allowed a deduction based on how much of the home and 
utilities are used for business. This can be a big and important deduction 
for you.
Depending on the specifics of your situation, you may be able to take more 
deductions; a good accountant who specializes in small business can prob-
ably save you the costs of his fees and more.
Putting in a fax and separate phone line
When you want to contact a business you pick up the phone and dial its 
number. When people want to call you up to do business, they should be able 
to do the same thing. This means it’s probably a good idea to have your own 
business line.

310
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
The other thing that you may want to consider is getting a designated fax 
number as well. If budget is a concern (and when is it not?), then you can 
use one phone line and purchase a fax that automatically answers when 
another fax signal is calling. The only drawback to this setup is that when 
you’re receiving faxes you can’t use that phone line until the fax is complete. 
Another nice option is to get a fax system set up with e-mail, so faxes are 
automatically delivered to your e-mail.
Keeping accurate records
Keeping good records not only helps you at tax time but also helps you do 
better business. You need to be able to put your hands on client’s records, to 
keep track of when you sent submissions and to whom, and to have a place 
for contracts so you can refer to them easily if questions arise. Not to men-
tion keeping track of your income and outgo so you can see if you’re making 
any money!
With your cartooning business, you want to keep the following accurate:
 
✓ Banking records: Keeping accurate records helps you not only during 
tax time, but also if the IRS ever requests to review them (see the 
“Keeping the IRS happy” section for more on this subject). Your bank-
ing records include all your income and expenses. Make sure you keep 
receipts of supplies and any equipment you purchase that helps you 
do business.
 
✓ Client lists: You also want to keep a current list of past and present 
clients so that you can follow up with them about additional work they 
may need, including what you’ve submitted to them and when, so you 
don’t send them the same thing more than once!
Keeping track of submissions also helps when you need some moneymaking 
ideas. That magazine cover you drew two years ago paid well; you may want 
to do it again. It’s a good idea to send old editors a fun or colorful postcard 
with a current sample of your work on one side and your contact informa-
tion on the other. You simply drop it in the mail, telling them that you’re still 
around and to give you a call if they need anything in the future.
Promoting Your Work Online
In today’s digital age, one of the most valuable tools you can use to market 
your work is the Internet. Having your own Web site is the digital equivalent 
of the business card, or more appropriately, a giant billboard. This section 
breaks down why having a presence online is important and what you need 
to do to get there.

311
 Chapter 16: Making Cartooning Your Livelihood
Why being on the Web is important
By having your own designated Web space, you can market your work and 
potentially reach people who may not see your materials if you market only 
in the traditional ways of local newspapers and syndicates. You can show-
case your work that people can’t find anywhere else in newsprint, like your 
full-color and animated cartoons. You can also direct people to your site if 
they want to see the type of work you do.
You may also choose to do cartoons specifically for your site. Many cartoon-
ists are opting to publish Internet-only comics on their own sites, forgoing 
newsprint altogether. The advantage to this is that you’re your own editor 
and you don’t have to tone down content for a family-friendly newspaper. As 
time goes on, webcomics will continue to grow in popularity.
How to make a splash on the Web
Webcomics have some definite advantages over print comics. Webcomics 
allow the cartoonist great freedom and leeway regarding creativity and subject 
matter, and anyone who can afford a Web site can publish his own cartoons.
The creator of a webcomic has more control over his feature than a tradi-
tional cartoonist does, but he also must bear more responsibility. Webcomic 
creators are like small businessmen. They’re responsible for not only writing 
and drawing the comic feature — just as if they partnered with a syndicate — 
but also the Web site design, advertising, marketing, and sales of related 
merchandise. The upside is the webcomic creator keeps 100 percent of the 
revenues instead of giving half to the syndicate.
The Internet has a vast sea of popular webcomics. They’re done by amateurs 
and professionals alike, who take advantage of the ability to publish anything 
on the Internet. The more advanced webcomic creators display their features 
in full color and even use some animation. Two big aspects of creating a web-
comic that can generate revenue are as follows:
 
✓ Merchandise and books sold on the Web site: Many online print-on-
demand (POD) companies cater to Web sites that can offer books for 
sale as well as other merchandise such as T-shirts.
 
✓ Advertising: The more people come to read the comic, the more traf-
fic the Web site gets and the more likely it is to pick up a small amount 
of revenue from advertising. You can also list your webcomic in search 
engines, like Google and Yahoo!, so that when people are searching for 
cartoons or other artwork, your site pops up. In order to list your site in 
a search engine, you may consider a search engine optimization service. 
These services can help you list your site with multiple search engines 

312
Part IV: Cartooning 2.0: Taking Your Cartoons to the Next Level 
so you don’t have to list on each one individually. These services can 
also provide you with assistance on how to best list your site to maxi-
mize its place on a search list.
If you don’t already have a Web site, I suggest you get one started. Beginners 
can purchase great simple programs at any software store and use them 
to set up a Web site. You also have the option of hiring someone to do it 
for you. Check out Building a Web Site For Dummies by David Crowder and 
Rhonda Crowder (published by Wiley) for a book full of info on starting, 
maintaining, and promoting your Web site.
Dilbert’s creator: Changing with the times
Typically, syndicated cartoonists have looked 
to the Internet with a mix of confusion and 
mistrust. After all, these are people whose pro-
fessional income is based largely on syndica-
tion to newspapers, and the Web is steadily 
eroding the newspaper’s ability to land daily 
readers. But Scott Adams has embraced the 
new medium with gusto.
His Web site, www.dilbert.com, features 
the daily comic, of course, along with a blog 
updated by Adams himself, animations, and 
other regular features. More important, Adams 
is embracing the Web’s ability to help him 
connect with his readers on a deeper level. 
Readers can respond to Adams’ blog posts and 
even rewrite previous Dilbert comics using their 
own punch lines.
And of course, as they’re interacting with the 
site, they’re allowed plenty of opportunities 
to become aware of the many other ways to 
participate in all that is Dilbert — with their 
credit cards. Ever the shrewd businessperson, 
Adams is poised to make a seamless transition 
from a newspaper-based business to a Web-
based one. One can only imagine Dogbert’s tail 
wagging in approval.

make cartooning look easy, but creating a viable cartoon strip takes a 
lot of time and effort. In this chapter, I give you a quick overview of the steps 
you need to take to create an interesting, salable, well-drawn comic strip.
Researching the Market
Creating a comic strip, webcomic, comic book, or other cartoon character-
based story line offers you the chance to create your very own world — a 
world where you have total control, creative license, and the opportunity to 
have fun for years to come. However, one point to always keep in mind is that 
cartoons and cartoon characters are commercial products. And as with any 
other product, one of the first things you should do is research the market.
You may have an idea for a great comic strip that’s been rattling around for 
a while inside that hollow space between your ears. But how do you know it 
hasn’t been done before? Basically, researching the market means perusing 
daily newspapers and studying the cartoons they currently publish, as well 
as surfing the Web to look at webcomics and other cartoons. The best way 

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
to know these things is to research the idea and find out! The Internet, your 
local library, and your favorite bookstore are good places to start. (For more 
information on marketing your work, see Chapter 16.) Doing so can give you 
a good idea of what’s out there and what’s not and hopefully inspire you to 
come up with an idea that no one else has thought of yet.
Developing an Idea
Think you have a great idea for a comic strip? Everybody has ideas pop into 
their head, but how do you know the difference between a good idea and a 
bad idea? Knowing the difference may prevent you from going through a lot 
of trouble and frustration later. Here are a few things to consider when mull-
ing over an idea for a comic strip:
 
✓ Choose a subject that you find appealing. Otherwise, you may find the 
idea tedious and dread working on it down the road.
 
✓ Choose a unique idea. Try and find something that no one else has 
done before to set yourself apart from the crowd.
 
✓ Choose an idea based on a theme that you know something about. 
This gives you special insight into the world you’re creating and makes 
it easier for you to come up with future story lines.
 
✓ Most important, be creative! Think outside the box. Develop your char-
acters in ways that play against stereotype, or choose a setting that’s 
out of the ordinary.
Every creative engineer needs a solid plan, and the plan for developing your 
comic strip world starts with a great idea.
Composing a Theme and Main Idea
Before you jump into drawing characters and writing story lines, you need 
to determine your strip’s main idea and theme. The main idea for your strip 
comes from the characters and the plot of the story. In contrast, the theme 
reflects the actions or events that are repeated and ongoing.
For example, the theme may be family life, work life, life in the forest, life on 
another planet, or any combination of the most common themes. Your main 
idea may center on a single father and his kids.

317
 Chapter 17: Ten Steps to a Finished Comic Strip
However, you can expand the idea to have the father and kids live on a space-
ship, so your comic strip may have a high-tech, outer space, futuristic theme, 
as well as a family theme. These themes would emerge in the strip, which 
would chronicle the ongoing and amusing challenges faced by a family living 
in outer space.
Creating Your Characters
The ability to create and develop interesting characters is one of the best 
parts of being a cartoonist. Although the possibilities for character develop-
ment are endless, common characters tend to fall into certain stereotypical 
categories. Consider creating a character that you can relate to or may have 
some insight into.
For example, if you’re a parent, you may want to create a character who’s 
a parent. If you’re terrible at all sports except bowling, you may want to 
incorporate that trait into the character. Many great characters have strong 
and identifiable personalities, like the lovable but dimwitted dad (see Homer 
Simpson), the miserable boss (Mr. Slate from The Flintstones), or the smarter-
than-all-the-adults little kid (Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes). These kinds of 
characters can provide you with endless script possibilities.
 
Much of who Charlie Brown was is said to reflect his creator, Charles Schulz. 
Charlie Brown’s longtime infatuation with the little redheaded girl is no coin-
cidence; Schulz had his own red-haired girl when he was in his twenties. 
Schulz proposed marriage and she turned him down and unexpectedly mar-
ried someone else. Schulz never got that little redheaded girl and was forever 
disappointed . . . just as Charlie Brown was forever disappointed in never 
being able to kick the football! See Chapters 6 through 11 for more detailed 
information about creating your comic characters.
Designing the Setting
Your characters, like everyone else, need a place to live and hang out. Before 
you actually start sketching, select the setting for your strip. The setting 
includes major elements like the background and surrounding environment 
in which your characters coexist. Designing the right setting goes a long way 
toward creating your strip’s overall look. The setting should complement the 
characters, reinforce the theme, and reflect your style.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The backgrounds and setting should enhance what your characters are doing 
without taking away from the main action. They add a sense of reality and are 
fun to draw, besides. See Chapters 12 and 14 for more on backgrounds and 
settings.
Writing Your Scripts
Before you can actually draw your cartoon, you need to write scripts. Similar 
to a movie’s screenplay, the comic script is the basic foundation for the rest 
of the production. The movie director and camera crew would have no idea 
what to do without a script to follow, and you won’t know what to draw with-
out a script, either. Chapter 5 gives you the nuts and bolts for writing your 
scripts.
 
Keep a notebook to keep track of all your story lines. You may also want to set 
aside a certain part of the week just to write the scripts and then budget the 
remainder of the week to ink them up.
Another thing to consider when writing scripts is how to pace the dialogue 
in relation to the art. Typically, comic strips are drawn in a horizontal, multi-
panel strip form made up of several individual boxes. The key in writing the 
script is to pace the dialogue so that it fits the respective boxes in a manner 
that flows. The longer you write in comic strip format, the better your timing 
will get.
Penciling It Out
After you develop some story lines and write your scripts, you’re finally 
ready to start putting your ideas on paper. Begin by lightly sketching out a 
rough idea with your character’s shapes and background elements. You don’t 
want to go to dark with the pencil lines if you plan on erasing the sketch after 
you ink your line art.
If you’re drawing your comic strip in the basic, horizontal, multipanel format, 
you need to block this area out. You do this on a large piece of paper with a 
pencil and a ruler.
 
You can also purchase paper that has already been blocked out in nonphoto 
blue guidelines. A comic book or Internet art supply store may carry this kind 
of paper.

319
 Chapter 17: Ten Steps to a Finished Comic Strip
 
Regardless of your sketching method, don’t sketch too heavily. You’ll be eras-
ing your lines later, so sketch light! For more information on sketching, see 
Chapter 4.
Slinging the Ink
After you finish the pencil sketch to your satisfaction, you’re ready to move 
on to the final inking stage. Inking is basically using a brush or a pen com-
bined with black ink to go over your light pencil sketch.
You ink the final art for a couple of reasons:
 
✓ You need to have the art in a format that can be easily reproduced. 
Pencil lines are very hard to reproduce and can fade and drop out, 
making your art hard to read. By contrast, nice, dark, black line work is 
easily reproduced and therefore easy for people to read.
 
✓ It’s so much fun! Using a brush and black India ink is a longtime tradi-
tion in cartooning. Inking your cartoons can produce art that’s crisp and 
clean, like that of Bill Watterson and Walt Kelly, or energetic and fluid, 
like the work of Richard Thompson and Ralph Steadman.
 
When inking your work, don’t just trace your pencil lines, because doing so 
produces work that looks stiff and deliberate. The key is to lightly sketch out 
your work in pencil and then do all the drawing with pen and ink or a brush. 
This method allows the final art to have a softer, more spontaneous line qual-
ity and to be more appealing to the eye. (Chapter 4 tells you everything you 
need to know about inking your cartoons.)
Lettering
After you ink in your art, add dialogue to your word balloons. Lettering 
should be neat and clean and reflect your style by being complementary to 
the line art.
You may choose to write in the lettering first before you ink the art so that 
you have enough clear space for lettering. You can adjust the art around it 
later. It’s really up to your own personal preference, so experiment and see 
what works best for you.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Using a computer type font is okay if you use one that doesn’t look like a 
computer type font; otherwise, your lettering will appear too rigid and stick 
out like a sore thumb. Hand lettering your work takes longer than using a 
type font, but the results pay off because it will most likely look better and 
complement the rest of your line art (see Chapter 13 for all the details on let-
tering your cartoons).
Scanning In Your Work
The last step in the process is to scan your artwork into your computer. You 
must scan your line art in the computer in order to color it, resize it, format 
the image file, and, of course, e-mail it or post the image on the Web.
To scan in your black-and-white line art, follow these steps:
 
1. Place your artwork face down on the scanner glass.
 
2. Select Bitmap mode to scan in black-and-white line art.
 
3. Scan in your line art at 300 dpi or better.
 
4. Save your work as a TIFF file.
Turn to Chapter 15 for more on scanning your artwork into your computer.

Ten Secrets to Breaking 
in to a Cartooning Career
In This Chapter
▶ Sending your work to a syndicate
▶ Getting your cartoons in comic books, greeting cards, and magazines
▶ Joining professional organizations
▶ Finding inspiration and resources online and in books
E
very young aspiring cartoonist wants to know how to break in to the 
cartooning business. However, finding information on how to actually 
become a published cartoonist isn’t easy; colleges don’t offer a specific 
degree that will land you a job, and you’ll find few seminars on the subject.
You need to consider many important factors when getting into the busi-
ness. After you’re satisfied that you have what it takes to be a professional 
cartoonist, you have to start thinking about marketing your work. When 
you’re starting your cartooning career, it’s important to think of your work 
as a product, just like any other business would. Your characters may be 
near and dear to your heart, but to the people who market cartoons, they’re 
just another commodity.
The market you’re aiming for helps you decide what type of product to pitch, 
and vice versa. Certain types of cartoons appear only in certain media. Comic 
strips are marketed to newspapers and Web sites, editorial cartoons are mar-
keted to newspapers for their editorial pages, and gag panel cartoons can be 
marketed to magazines.
In this chapter, I tell you some of the tricks of the trade that can help open 
the doors to a career as a cartoonist. These include how to find markets that 
may welcome your work, great conventions or events to attend, and what 
professional organizations you may consider joining.

Making the Decision to 
Pursue Your Dreams
One of the first steps to breaking in to the cartooning business is simply to 
make the decision to try. You envision yourself drawing a successful cartoon. 
To do so, you first have to sit down and try. You can’t reach your dreams if 
you don’t take the first step. Stop making excuses and jump in. After you start 
drawing, polish your work before sending it out, and remember that your 
competition is enormous — but don’t let that discourage you completely. 
Every famous cartoonist started out as an unknown.
Belonging to a Syndicate
To succeed as a professional cartoonist, you have to grasp the importance of 
syndication. You can’t make it in newsprint cartoons without belonging to a 
syndicate. Syndication simply means selling the presentation of cartoons to 
multiple users. Syndicates represent cartoonists and sell their work to news-
papers and magazines. Syndication is every cartoonist’s goal, but few really 
understand what a syndicate is and how it works. For more on syndication, 
check out Chapter 1.
If you think you have what it takes, you can contact several major syndicates 
directly for more information:

Jumping into the World of Comic Books
If you dream of being a successful cartoonist, one of the best arenas you 
have an opportunity to succeed in is the world of comic books. The comic 
book industry has grown faster in the last decade than any other cartooning-
related industry.
Comic books were once thought of as something read by nerds or geeks, but 
those nerds and geeks are laughing all the way to the bank. All you have to 
do is look at how many movies have been made in recent years that were 
based on popular comic books: Superman, Batman, Hellboy, Spawn, Iron Man, 
X-Men, Spider-Man, Sin City, and the Hulk, just to name a few. DC Comics, 
Marvel Comics, Image Comics, and Todd McFarlane Entertainment are some 
of the biggest comic book publishers, and they’re always looking for new 
talent. But you’ve got to be really good to get a job there!
Taking a trip to the largest comic book convention
If comic books are your passion, why not start 
at the big kahuna of comic book conventions? 
To demonstrate how much the comic book 
industry has grown, all you have to do is look at 
Comic-Con International San Diego, commonly 
known as Comic-Con or the San Diego Comic-
Con. This annual convention is traditionally 
a four-day event that runs Thursday through 
Sunday and is usually held in late July at the 
San Diego Convention Center.
Originally showcasing comic books, the con-
vention has expanded over the years to include 
a variety of pop culture areas such as anime, 
manga, animation, video games, newsprint 
comics, webcomics, toys and collectibles, and, 
of course, the movie industry.
The convention is the largest of its kind in the 
world, with more than 145,000 attendees in 
2008. The event is basically a Star Trek/Star 
Wars convention on steroids and is an abso-
lute must-see for any cartooning fan. Attendees 
can browse the hundreds of booths set up by 
professional cartoonists and industry-related 
practitioners showcasing their latest art, toys, 
or comic book publication; sit in on any number 
of lectures and seminars scheduled throughout 
the convention; and meet many of the star illus-
trators, like Spider-Man creator Stan Lee, or the 
latest star of a comic book-based movie.

324

Marketing to Greeting Card Companies
Another great way to get your foot into the cartooning business is through 
greeting cards. Greeting cards are a popular item and offer promising 
opportunities to an aspiring cartoonist. Someone has to draw all those 
amusing sketches, sight gags, and one-liners on all those humorous cards. 
Why not you?
Greeting cards come in a wide range of designs and cover all sorts of holidays, 
events, and special subjects. Many of these cards showcase cartoon gags or 
funny characters to deliver a message to that special someone. Hundreds of 
companies make greeting cards in the United States alone. If you think you 
may want to try your hand at creating some greeting cards and you think 
you’re really good, two of the major greeting card companies are:
 
✓ American Greetings, 1 American Rd., Cleveland, OH 44144-2301.
 
✓ Hallmark, P.O. Box 419034, Mail Drop 216, Kansas City, MO 64141.
There are numerous smaller greeting card companies as well. This is just a 
brief list:
 
✓ Avanti Press, Submissions, 6 W. 18th St., 6th floor, New York, NY 10011.
 
✓ Comstock Cards, Production Dept. – Gaglines, 600 S. Rock Blvd., #15, 
Reno, NV 89502.
 
✓ Freedom Greetings, Art Submissions, 38A Park St., Medfield, MA 02052.
 
✓ Gallant Greetings, 4300 United Parkway, Schiller Park, IL 60176.
Selling Your Work to Magazines
Another way to break in to the cartooning industry is by taking a stab with 
magazines. Take a quick glance through many magazines today and you’ll 
be surprised to discover that all sorts of them run a cartoon or two in their 
monthly issues. Cartoons are published in a wide variety of magazines, rang-
ing from Road & Track to Better Homes and Gardens.
 
Magazines typically run what are known as gag cartoons, also called panel 
cartoons, which are cartoons that use only a single panel and are usually 
more sophisticated than comic strips. Magazine cartoons also rely more on 
the caption and punch line to tell the story and less on the art. Consequently, 

325
 Chapter 18: Ten Secrets to Breaking in to a Cartooning Career
many of the more successful magazine cartoonists draw in a simple, minimal-
ist style that highlights a sense of sophistication and is less “cartoony” than 
other genres.
Perhaps one of the most popular magazines that has a history of running 
sophisticated panel cartoons is The New Yorker, which runs cartoons from 
a staple of regular freelancers. If you think you can inject an intellectual, 
highbrow sense of humor into your work, contact The New Yorker at 4 Times 
Square, New York, NY 10036 to find out what type of material the magazine is 
looking for and what you need to do to submit.
Joining the Association of American 
Editorial Cartoonists
The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists (http://editorial
cartoonists.com/) is a professional organization concerned with promot-
ing the interests of staff, freelance, and student editorial cartoonists in the 
United States. It’s the only formal organization that includes and represents 
editorial cartoonists exclusively. Joining an organization like the AAEC can 
have many benefits for an up-and-coming editorial cartoonist. These include 
making valuable contacts, learning the business from seasoned professionals, 
and getting constructive feedback on your work.
The AAEC was officially formed in 1957 by a small group of newspaper 
cartoonists led by John Stampone of the Army Times. It was created to pro-
mote and stimulate public interest in the editorial cartoon and to create 
interaction between political cartoonists. The annual AAEC convention is 
held around June of each year in various cities around the country. These 
conventions are popular and allow cartoonists to meet with others from the 
journalism community, including publishers, writers, historians, and collec-
tors. Members of the AAEC include nearly every major editorial cartoonist 
working today.
One of the great things about the AAEC is its recognition of the brightest 
young cartoonists in the country. One way the AAEC does this is by giving 
the annual Locher Award, which honors the best college editorial cartoon-
ist in the nation. The award was named after the late son of Dick and Mary 
Locher. Dick is a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for the Chicago 
Tribune, best known as the artist for the Dick Tracy comic strip. Since 1987, 
the AAEC has given the Locher Award to some of the best young cartoonists 
in the country, who’ve all gone on to have a successful career in cartooning, 
including the author of this book, who won the award back in 1996.

Being Part of the National 
Cartoonists Society
The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) (www.reuben.org/) is the world’s 
largest and most prestigious organization of professional cartoonists. The 
NCS was born in 1946 when groups of cartoonists got together to entertain 
the troops during World War II. They found that they enjoyed one another’s 
company and decided to get together on a regular basis.
Joining the NCS has many benefits for professional cartoonists as they begin 
their career. These include:
 
✓ Learning the business from some of the biggest names in cartooning 
(networking is always beneficial; it really is true that it’s who you know, 
not what you know, in many business situations).
 
✓ Being continually encouraged to grow in your work.
 
✓ Making some great lifelong friends who know what your life is like. 
Misery does love company, and commiserating about deadlines, or 
worse yet, difficult editors or clients, can help you feel less alone in what 
can be an isolated job.
Today, the NCS membership roster includes more than 500 of the world’s 
major cartoonists working in many branches of the profession, including 
newspaper comic strips and panels, comic books, editorial cartoons, anima-
tion, gag cartoons, greeting cards, advertising, magazine and book illustra-
tion, and more.
Membership is limited to established professional cartoonists, with the 
exception of a few outstanding persons in affiliated fields. The NCS is not a 
guild or union, although members join forces from time to time to fight for 
their rights, and the organization regularly uses the talents of the member-
ship to help worthwhile causes.
Looking at the Most Popular 
Cartoon Site on the Web
If you want to get a better feel for what a successful cartoonist needs to do, 
you should check out perhaps the most popular cartooning Web site: Cagle’s 
Professional Cartoon Index at www.cagle.com. News junkies and cartoon 
fans won’t want to miss this great site, which is updated daily with the latest

cartoons. Part of the MSN/MSNBC Web site, it showcases the best editorial 
cartoons from all the top political cartoonists in the world. You can find thou-
sands of cartoons covering the latest issues in politics and pop culture there.
Checking Out Cartoon Blogs
In the digital age, keeping up with the cartooning world with news and inside 
information from cartoonists’ personal Web sites and blogs is important. You 
can find thousands of cartooning Web sites and blogs out there; just use your 
favorite search engine to search for “cartooning blogs” to see what I mean.
 
Here are just a few Internet sources to get you started:
 
✓ The Daily Cartoonist (dailycartoonist.com): A great resource for 
news and the inside scoop about cartoons and comics.

this site is invaluable for keeping up on what’s going on with comics.
 
✓ Richards Poor Almanac (richardspooralmanac.blogspot.com):

A revealing look inside his cartooning process.
 
✓ Journalista (www.tcj.com/journalista): “The Comics Journal 
Weblog,” a great blog to keep you up-to-date on the latest inside news 
regarding cartooning.
Reading about Cartooning
One of the best ways to become attuned to the vast number of cartooning 
markets is to invest in a few books that give you the ins and outs of the indus-
try. And one of the best ways to become a better cartoonist is to study the 
work of some of the foremost practitioners in the field.
Many great books are out there, but here’s a list to get you started:
 
✓ Artist’s & Graphic Designer’s Market (edited by Erika O’Connell; Writers 
Digest Books) contains a wealth of information, including names and 
addresses of magazines, newspapers, and other potential markets for 
your work.
 
✓ The Best Political Cartoons of the Year, editions 2005 through current.
