Social Development Experiences in China

This book series brings together the latest research results of Chinese sociologists to
summarize and analyse the process, mechanism and experiences of China’s social
development since the economic system reform. The analyses are tackled by
looking into seven inter-relationships that are most often discussed among
sociologists in observing the social transition in China: the relationship between
the state and society; the relationship between the state and market; the relationship
between the state and peasants, the relationship between the central and local
governments; the relationship between government and enterprises; the relationship
between urban and rural areas; the relationship between labour and capital.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The Chinese society has gone through more than one hundred years of modern-
ization. Trying to understand the tremendous social changes, scholars in the modern
times wrote books on various aspects of social transformation, including artifacts,
institutions, ethos, etc. Contemporary intellectuals have also conducted numerous
researches on the ideological changes, political vicissitudes, social evolution,
institutional transitions and cultural transformation. In fact, both from the macro
perspective of social structure evolution and the micro perspectives, the economic
organization in modern China can also serve as a starting point for understanding
China’s modernization and social change. For examples, with the emergence of the
enterprise organization, the social relationships began to change and reorganize; the
rise of industrial class relations led to the formation of new social morale and waves
of revolution.
Starting from the Westernization Movement (1861–1895) and the Hundred
Day’s Reform (1898), changes had already taken place in China’s social organi-
zation, as were reﬂected in the ﬁelds of politics, society and economy. In politics,
new political groups and even new political parties had begun to emerge in the form
of “he qun li hui” (“gathering people and forming societies” advocated by Kang
Youwei and Liang Qichao), gradually transforming the original political landscape
dominated by imperial rule and political cliques. In the ﬁelds of society and
economy, the emergence of enterprise organizations, no matter state-run or private,
had begun to transform the original socio-economic structure based on feudalism
and patrimonialism, and form a new social organizational system between the old
systems of “state” and “family.” From this point of view, China’s modernization
was precisely embodied in the emergence of this intermediary organizational form.
Between the patriarchal and imperial systems (“qin qin” and “zun zun”) in the
traditional social structure, was added a new layer of the democratic republic
system which was based on modern concepts. Its social organization took the form
of political parties at the state level, and took the forms of enterprise organization
and self-governing local communities at the grassroots level. It can be said that, as
early as the late Qing dynasty, the overall social structure of modern China had

already begun to emerge in its embryonic form. In Kang Youwei and Liang
Qichao’s political ideas of “gathering people and forming societies,” in the New
Citizen thoughts based on Yan Fu’s “theory of groups,” and in Sun Yat-sen’s
political notions of “people’s rights” and “people’s livelihood,” we can all see the
new social form of group organization, which was the driving force behind China’s
transition from its traditional social structure to the modern social structure. Thus,
the basic contradictions in social relations between “the state” and “the people,”
between “labor” and “capital” gradually became the main theme in China’s political
and social evolutions in the following 100 years.
1.1
The Traditional Pattern of the Chinese Society
Fei Xiaotong once noted in a discussion on China’s dual-track politics that, in fact,
a kind of “dual-track system” was adopted in the operation of China’s traditional
social structure. “A healthy and sustainable political system must be a kind of
dual-track system which can reach both ways between the top and the grassroots.”1
In this dual-track system, a centralized bureaucracy constituted the top-down sys-
tem of imperial rule; a self-governing system of the local communities constituted
the bottom-up system of gentry power. A delicate power balance was created by
this dual-track system. Although the imperial rule was the formal administrative
system serving as the basis of China’s grand uniﬁcation, the power of the central
rule only reached the county level, so that the situation of all-pervasive despotism
was avoided. There are several reasons why the system of gentry power could form
restraints on imperial rule. The ﬁrst is that a member of the local gentry could refuse
to receive order from the government ofﬁcials; relying on their own folk status, they
could go in and out of all levels of government, even get in touch with the emperor
himself to play a role in social governance. The second is that the local gentry came
from families of great wealth and prominence, they were not within the system of
bureaucracy. This kind of informal political identity and culturally formed social
prestige made them focus their energy on protecting the local interests, and take a
passive strategy in politics. They only came out to work when they were needed.
When they were not needed, they withdrew into self-cultivation.2 Fei Xiaotong
attributed the dual-track system to the separation between Confucianism proper and
the Confucian orthodoxy, which aroused some arguments in the academic circle.
However, the existence of such a dual-track system indeed prevented the formation
of a third social organizing force besides the two levels of “state” and “family,” or
“imperial rule” and “gentry power,” making it difﬁcult for the social economy to
overcome the limitations of clanship and passive governance.

Introduction

Taking a different perspective, the dual-track political system can offer expla-
nations for why in China large-scale social production didn’t emerge, why in China
the capitalist system and its corresponding class relations didn’t emerge. No wonder
Fei in his discussion on China’s modern changes said that the opening of treaty
ports and appearance of a new comprador class, in addition to the capital invasion
and colonization of imperialism, destroyed the integrity of the old self-governing
units with the local gentry as the core, and thus dismantled the dual-track politics in
China. From the perspective of social economy, the combination of agriculture and
handicraft industry was the main characteristic of the traditional rural economy. The
cities and the countryside complemented each other and maintained a balance of
grassroots governance. However, by the end of the 19th century, with the inﬂux of
foreign goods and capital, new types of production relations and social relations
began to form, severing the ties of mutual protection between the cities and the
countryside. Inevitably, the grassroots societies went to ruin.
Different from Fei Xiaotong’s comparatively conservative stance, Tao Xisheng
maintained that commercial capital had appeared in China long ago, but com-
mercial capital did not necessarily equal with capitalism, because feudal factors still
existed in China’s society, and took different forms in different historical periods.
A society with pre-capitalist factors cannot be called a capitalist society. Then a
question should be asked. What kind of society was China indeed? Tao Xisheng
claimed that, on the one hand, the feudal system, the patriarchal clan system, the
feudal lords had disappeared, on the other hand feudal forces, patriarchal clan
forces, contract landlords and personal afﬁliation still existed. Such a society can be
called “a pre-capitalist society with feudal elements,” or “a society following the
Principle of People’s Livelihood,” or “a society dominated by landlords and under
the control of ﬁnancial and commercial capital,” or “a society formed on the basis of
scholar-bureaucrat status and peasant labor relations after the breakdown of feu-
dalism but before the full development of capitalism.”3
Tao Xisheng emphasized the distinction between feudal system and feudal
forces, because he wanted to emphasize that the traditional Chinese society did not
lack factors compatible with the modern economic system. The scholar-bureaucrats,
who represented the patriarchal clan forces, were capable of reaching every level of
the society including the monarch, the landlords and the grassroots peasants, and
were endowed with political power, land ownership and cultural privilege at the
same time. However, as the backbone of China’s bureaucracy, they also caused a
great deal of harm. “The scholar-bureaucrats were in fact the source of bad gov-
ernance in China.” It hindered the development of capitalism in China, making it
difﬁcult for a really socialized and organizational social production system to
appear. This blank in the evolution of social system resulted in the combination of
agriculture and handicraft industry, in the blockage of transportation, in the misuse
of currency, in the exploitation of landlords and usurers, in the warlords’ seg-
mentation of the country, and in the invasion of China by Western capitalism and

imperialism, which availed themselves of China’s disadvantages. These led to the
overall crisis of modern China.4 Therefore, “the Chinese society is a pre-capitalist
society with many feudal elements, is under the control of foreign capital, is
changing from a society under the exploitation of capitalization, especially of
ﬁnancial capital and commercial capital, to a People’s Livelihood society, which
demands a national revolution.”5
Although Tao Xisheng and Fei Xiaotong made different judgments on China’s
traditional social structure, at least we can see that neither imperial rule in the form
of feudal system or prefecture system nor scholar-bureaucrats and gentry class
upholding the patriarchal clan system as their core ideology could go beyond the
social system of “family” and “state” to press for the formation of a capitalist order
for socialized production. This viewpoint is quite similar to Weber’s viewpoint on
China’s traditional society. Weber held that among the traditional forms of domi-
nation, the patriarchal domination was the most basic form, and the patriarchs
enjoyed full authority within the family or clan. In social economy, such a form of
domination was realized as “domination of patrimonialism,” its nature being a kind
of afﬁliation relationship. However, it was different from the feudal system in
Western Europe, which was capable of evolving the relationship of free contract.6
Although Confucianism did not lack rational ingredients for statecraft and utility,
this ideology by nature could not escape the constraint of “traditionalism,” could
not progress toward the modern bureaucratic system in politics, could not create a
socialized capital system to take over the system of family property relationship. In
sum, due to the continuation and maintenance of this type of traditionalism, it was
impossible to push the whole society into a phase of all-round rationalization. As a
result, neither the modern administrative system, nor the proﬁt-making enterprise
organization, nor ethical and socialized personality could be established under such
a form of domination.
Wasn’t there a third domain composed of industrial organization in China’s
traditional social structure? In a study of economic history, Quan Hansheng pointed
out that the traditional economic organization in China was not strictly conﬁned
within the boundary of the family. There also existed organizations with the
characteristics of “professional groups.” For example, with the rise of the handicraft
industry in the Spring Autumn Period (770–476 BC) and Warring States Period
(475–221 BC), handicraft guilds and commercial guilds began to appear. These
forms of social organization have existed all along in China’s social production.
Organizations with professional characteristics like “hang” and “zuo” offered a
complete set of rules and regulations for economic activities including production,
transaction, pricing, loans, mortgages, weights and measures, etc. They also set the
social norms of economic activities, providing industry laws, social etiquettes,
sacriﬁcial rites, charity etc., which had great inﬂuence on the ethos of the whole

Introduction

society. More importantly, the “clubs” and “guild halls,” which were developed
from these professional groups, extended the scope of social organization into much
wider spaces, playing a prominent role in social unity and governance.7 In terms of
social morphology, this is quite similar to Emile Durkheim’s description of cor-
porate groups in the West in the Middle Ages.8
However, according to Quan Hansheng’s understanding, this organizational
form was embodied as apprenticeship9 with the characteristics of blood ties (or
quasi kinship relations), or as the system of townsmen association with the char-
acteristics of geographical closeness. Similar to Weber’s judgment, Quan observed
that although such professional groups could bring about many elements of capi-
talism, they could not truly escape the constraints of traditionalism, could not
cultivate the kind of religious rationality in either internal spirit or external system.
They could not foster the modern enterprise organization or the modern bureau-
cratic system. They were void of an inner drive of competition for transcending
traditionalism. Therefore, when faced with the invasion of fully socialized capital
from foreign capitalist powers, the social organization of “guild” in China’s tra-
dition withered rapidly.
It can be said that China’s traditional political economic structure failed to effec-
tively cultivate an intermediary organizational form of an industrial and professional
nature, failed to introduce a logic transcending “state” and “family” over broader
scope of social evolution. Although in different historical periods, civilized com-
munities like “xiang yue” (township regulations)10 and professional groups like “hang
hui” (guilds) were formed in various local areas, and many elements of the commodity
market also appeared, these organizational forms didn’t break the old social structure
dominated by family relations to evolve the social form of “organization.”
“Organization” was not a basic element of the Chinese society yet.11 Therefore, even
for the people who participated in group and industrial activities, their orders of
production, livelihood and ethics still depended on the orders of the “family” and
“state” hierarchies. These people were still incompetent on their own in coping with
the global expansion of western industry and commerce, and found it difﬁcult to meet
the challenges of professional governance and the notion of equality.12

9“The masters treated the apprentices like family members. Their relationship resembled that
between father and son, or that between brothers.” See Hansheng (2007, p. 187).

11According to the theory of social organism in the West, which often compares the composition of
the modern society to an organism, the organ of the social body, or society, is organization (or the
organizational process of society). In this sense, the formation of organization, or the formation of the
modern enterprise and modern government according to the principles of labor division and cooper-
ation, is just the process by which the logic of society is realized. It can be said that without organi-
zation, there will be no basic order for the making of the modern society. For reference, see Spencer
(1887), Durkheim (2000), Schaefﬂe (1885, pp. 84–101). Quoted in Durkheim (1888, pp. 3–7).
12This opinion can be seen in the early thoughts of Yan Fu. See Mill (1903).

1.2
Capital Invasion and the Formation
of the Working Class
China’s traditional social structure was broken only after a series of clashes with the
West in objects, systems and ideologies. Being forced to open its doors, extremely
serious harm was done to China in two main aspects. Firstly, the West forced
intervention on China’s centralized system and various sub-systems under it, and
directly threatened China’s territory and trade sovereignty. Secondly, China’s
small-scale peasant economy and corresponding social arrangements were directly
exposed to the colonial exploitation of Western industrial capital and commercial
capital, causing the overall social economy of China to go bankrupt, and the tra-
ditional base of the social structure to collapse.
Since the end of the 18th century, China has been under the duress of the West’s
global expansion. The establishment of consular jurisdiction marked the ﬁrst attack
on China’s sovereignty. After that, China’s customs administration was also con-
trolled by the West. Unequal tariff agreements, severe imbalance of import and
export tax rate, as well as various forms of tax cuts and tax exemption, reduced
China to absolute inferiority in international trade. In the meantime the powerful
Western capital, fully grown after accumulation through industrial revolution and
world trade, began its unbridled invasion of China,13 taking advantage of the
administrative privileges obtained in colonialist activities. From the second half of
the 19th century to the early 20th century, particularly under the rapid expansion of
foreign banks, the Chinese market suffered a crushing defeat in international
competition. Under the combined oppression of the industrial capital, commercial
capital and ﬁnancial capital of Western capitalism, China’s traditional agriculture,
handicraft industry and the organizational system of its feudal economy rapidly
collapsed. The comprador class took over the function of the traditional gentry at
the grassroots level. Coerced by the unfavorable conditions, the central government
and the national capital could only grope their way out by setting up four types of
modern industrial organizations, i.e., government-run, merchant-run, merchant-run
with government supervision, and government-and-merchant-jointly-run.
After the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), with the introduction of modern
industrial technology and modern factory system, enterprise organizations appeared
in China in large numbers, China’s urban working class began to form and grow. In
the late 19th and early 20th century, imperialism’s invasion of China’s economy
escalated in scale, scope and speed. Investments increased rapidly in railway,
mining, machinery and manufacturing. During the First World War, because the
European powers were involved in the war, China’s national industry had rapid

rural industries collapsed and the rural landownership rapidly drained away, the old

economic structure began to fall apart,14 large numbers of rural laborers swarmed
into the cities and entered factories. The traditional social structure began to
undergo signiﬁcant changes. The new socio-economic arena with capital at its core
became the fundamental force determining the changes in political and social
relations in China. Several fundamental problems followed this great force all
along. The ﬁrst is imperialist colonization, which often manifested itself as the
conquest of China with the capital market. The second is that the feudal forces often
mobilized their capital resources and intensiﬁed the political and economic changes
through becoming compradors and other means. The third is that the capitalist
mode of production inevitably caused the separation of the bourgeoisie from the
proletariat, while promoting industrial organizations. In this sense, labor issues had
even greater sociological signiﬁcance, and constituted one of the core contradic-
tions in China’s modernization process.
Different scholars and academic schools hold different opinions regarding the
rapid social changes reﬂected through the labor class issues. Such discrepancy in
understanding is not limited to the simple issue of employer-worker relations or
capital-labor relations. It lies in attempts to use the labor issues in China’s mod-
ernization process as a starting point to reveal the deep-rooted causes and effects of
China’s social changes, and prepare schemes for future social construction. It can
be said that ever since the three great debates in the 1920s on the nature of the
Chinese society, labor issues not only became a prominent subject of knowledge for
understanding China, but also served as a starting point for opening various aca-
demic and political paths in the following 20–30 years. Since then, Marxism,
anarchism, nationalism, populism, conservatism, the westernization theory, the
evolution theory and the theory of historical cycles have all ascended the stage of
history, all with a special perspective on the emerging working class.

Labor-Capital Contradictions and the Various
Programs of Social Construction
The rise of industrial organizations and the proletariat caused many unavoidable
contradictions in the process of social development. Generally speaking, the
scholars at that time identiﬁed several essential structural characteristics, made
different judgments on the new types of social relationships, and proposed various
schemes for social construction.
1. With the social development trend of industrialization and capitalization, the
foundation for the basic social structure of China had inevitably changed from
the patriarchal clan to the nuclear families of the working class. This means that

Capital Invasion and the Formation of the Working Class

the diffuse small families no longer had the multi-level protection provided by
the huge family network in the traditional society, which further undermined the
foundation of the traditional social structure. Under the new economic structure,
the working class families had only meager monetary payments as their main
source of income. The new economic system, unlike the small peasant economy
of the past, exposed even larger numbers of people directly to the threat of
market and ﬁnancial risks, easily thrusting them into bankruptcy and abject
poverty, thus creating an enormous class of the urban poor.15 In this sense, the
index of living costs, the index of wages and the index of consumer prices
became key indexes for maintaining social stability. In the tide waves of social
change, if the society could not provide effective protection for the impover-
ished labor classes, if it failed to establish a social cause beneﬁting all, China’
modernization could not be achieved.
In the 1920s, Tao Menghe’s Peking Institute of Social Survey aimed at carrying
out “social studies focusing on labor issues and the working class’s living
conditions.”16 One of the three main research projects proposed by Tao Menghe
was a study on the living costs of workers in Beiping.17 Tao’s book did not just
contain simple statistics, it aimed at describing the changes of the whole social
structure by looking at the basic social unit—the family. Taking Tao’s study on
the living costs in Beiping as an example, it presented data of 48 workers’
families in Beijing. Most of these families were made up of 4 or 5 people,
generally a couple and their children. Such families accounted for three ﬁfths of
the total. This indicates that “the working class families indeed match the small
family system of the modern era.” Based on this ﬁnding, Tao menghe reasoned
that “the traditional big family of China is only popular in the countryside and
among the wealthy now, the modern small family is more common in the cities
and among the poor.”18 It can be said that the appearance of industrial orga-
nizations weakened the overall social function of the traditional family, and put
the working class, characterized by widespread poverty, at the center of

17The Peking Institute of Social Survey carried out a rich variety of social researches. Its research
projects can be classiﬁed into ten major categories, including economic history, political system,
foreign trade, population issues, statistics, etc., with the largest number of research projects going
into the category of labor problems. Such projects include (1) compilation of The Second China
Labor Yearbook; (2) International Labor Organization; (3) research on labor disputes in Hebei,
Beiping and Tianjin; (4) survey of factory workers in Tanggu; (5) survey of Shanghai workers’
family livelihood; (6) survey of railway workers’ wages in North China; (7) survey of ﬂour mill
workers’ wages in Tianjin; (8) survey of textile workers’ wages in Northern China; (9) survey of
coal mine workers’ wages in Shandong Zhongxing. Based on these projects, a series of important
books were published, such as the ﬁrst and second China Labor Yearbook, An Analysis of the
Living Costs in Beiping, A Study on Shanghai Workers’ Living Conditions, A Survey of Tanggu
Workers.

contradiction in China’s social change. On the one hand, the traditional social
ties were broken; the workers became increasingly atomized. On the other hand,
the society failed to develop a social protection mechanism to counter this
situation. As a result, class contradiction gradually became the main social
contradiction in China.
2. With the rise of industrial organizations and the growth of the proletariat, and
due to the lack of effective mediation mechanism, the labor-capital contradiction
escalated rapidly; widespread vehement social movements broke out at the
grassroots society. Labor capital conﬂicts had existed in China ever since the
founding of its ﬁrst capitalist enterprise in the middle of the 19th century. But
before the end of the First World War, the labor-capital conﬂicts existed only in
its embryonic form. Only after the 1920s did the conﬂicts become increasingly
intense.19 Among the studies on labor-capital conﬂicts, the most important is
Chen Da’s longitudinal research on strikes. In 1926, Chen Da published
“Analysis on the domestic strikes in the past eight years.” In 1927, he published
“Analysis on the strikes since the 15th year of the Republic of China.” In the
1940s, he carried out a series of statistical analyses on the strikes in Chongqing,
Kunming, Shanghai and other places.
As for the reasons of the strikes, Chen Da made a classiﬁcation of seven major
types, including economic oppression, payment, mass movement, trade unions,
external conﬂicts, strikes of sympathy and miscellaneous.20 Different from the
orthodox study of the history of workers’ movement, which regarded strikes as
the workers’ resistance against the capital, Chen Da’s study eyed on the rela-
tionships between workers’ strikes and party politics, national awareness and
gangland turf wars. Chen Da claimed that the workers’ movements were not
isolated phenomenon, but intricately associated with other social movements,
such as national revolutionary movements, socialist movements, student
movements, peasant movements, and patriotic movements. He was particularly
critical of the political parties’ involvement in labor movement, saying that both
positive and negative effects were produced. On the positive side, “the workers
and peasants were awakened in a short time to participate in the liberation
movement. In a conservative society like ours, such effects cannot be achieved
so rapidly if political parties are not involved.” On the negative side, “when
labor movements followed the lead of politics, it became volatile, and could not
be very constructive. This is not beneﬁcial either to our industry or to our
society.” Following this reasoning, he advocated “independent labor movement
without political parties.” But at the same time, he also realized that independent
labor movements had to face the difﬁculties of “lack of leadership,” “lack of
education,” and “too much social resistance.”21

Labor-Capital Contradictions and the Various Programs of Social Construction

It could be seen from the social realities that what happened in China’s industrial
organizations was not limited to the interior of the enterprises or to the single
dimension of labor-capital relations. The contradictions inside the industrial
organizations gradually evolved into the working class’s relationship with the
whole society, as well as the direction of social movement it pushed forward.22
Moreover, the new economic organizational form of “industry” and the new
political organizational form of “political party” closely worked together to
decide to a greater extent the future direction of China’s social development.
3. In this period, legislation on labor issues was an important aspect of social
construction. It was also an important means for solving labor-capital conﬂicts
and reconciling class contradictions. However, for a new-born phenomenon like
industrial relations, what motivation and foundation should its legislation be
based on? How to adapt Western legal principles for application in China’s
industrial activities? These are very difﬁcult questions. In 1929, the Nanjing
Kuomingtang Government enacted the Labor Law, which caused a huge con-
troversy in the business circle. In 1931, Chen Da led a survey on the Factory
Law in Shanghai, and carried out an empirical study on the problems in the
enactment of the law. The study focused on the clauses concerning work time,
wages and beneﬁts, rest days and holidays, safety and health-care, etc.23 “The
result of the survey indicates that the immediate total implementation of the law
was not a wise choice.” “It’s suggested that implementation of the law should
start from the part about production safety.” This suggestion was accepted by
the government. “From 1931 to the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Factory
Law was only partially enforced in reality, the enforced part being the clauses on
safety and health-care.”24
Chen Da’s criticism of the legislation effort of the Kuomingtang government
had its reasons. The ideas behind the law far exceeded the scope that the society
at that time could adapt to and tolerate. By quoting the German jurist Savigny,
Chen Da pointed out that a harmonious relationship must be established
between the laws and the folk customs. “Savigny believes that a country’s laws
should be based on its folk customs. The folk customs should be studied
carefully and truthfully, should be understood and appreciated by all citizens. If
a country’s laws are codiﬁed without a thorough investigation of its folk cus-
toms, the laws will very often be incompatible with the national characters, and
incapable of producing effects on the society.” Chen Da noted, “Savigny’s
viewpoint is right to the point for China’s problem. China’s legislation over the
past twenty years had borrowed heavily from foreign statutory laws, many parts
22Ren and Pan (2006a) reports that, according to statistics of written historical records, from 1840
to the May 4th Movement in 1919, the Chinese workers launched a total of 533 economic strikes,
of which 285 strikes were launched by industrial workers in large-scale mechanized industries,
accounting for 53.5% of the total. Urban handicraftsmen and unskilled laborers launched 247
strikes, accounting for 46.5% of the total. See Ren and Pan (2006a). Also see Liu and Tang (2002).

Introduction

being sheer imitations. However, our legislators had seldom carefully studied
our folk customs. As a result, enforcement of the laws was often unsuccessful.”
Taking the Labor Law as an example, Chen Da pointed out, “the Law of Labor
Dispute Disposal by the Nanjing Kuomingtang government borrowed its
methods of mediation and arbitration from the legal systems of Australia,
Canada and England. The part about minimum wages in the Factory Law was
copied from the stipulations of the International Labor Ofﬁce. The part about
factory meetings was borrowed from soviet laws.”25 All these labor laws were
concocted without studying China’s reality, “while a wish was held that the
development of China’s industry will conform to the spirit of the laws.” Chen
Da claimed, “the laws should adapt themselves to the changing social con-
ventions and the changing industrial system. Only in this way can the laws cater
to the needs of the society, not the other way round.”26 “In our future legislation
efforts, we should ﬁrst carefully study our people’s customs, then make laws on
the basis of such studies. Laws made this way will prove effective in the
society.”27
Taking the same stance as Chen Da, Fang Xianting leveled similar criticisms at
the Factory Law, saying “it is quite irrelevant to the real situation of China’s
industry. Being so difﬁcult to implement, it can only be put on the ofﬁce
bookshelf for display.”28 Focusing on the textile industry, his study investigated
the Factory Law’s inﬂuence on industrial development and on the workers.
According to its provisions, the Factory Law was applicable only to mechanized
factories employing at least 30 workers. According to the ofﬁcial statistics in
1933, the total number of workers in such factories was only 400,000. Among
this, 250,000 workers worked in cotton yarn factories. Obviously, the imple-
mentation of the Factory Law would have the biggest impact on the cotton yarn
factories. Fang Xianting’s study aimed just at revealing this impact. Article 13
of the Factory Law stipulated that female workers were not permitted to work
from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am. Fang pointed out that at that time most factories
adopted a double-shift work schedule where it was common for workers to work
on either the day shift or the night shift. Female workers accounted for 70% of
the total. According to his calculation, if female workers’ night shifts were all
cancelled, 30% of all female workers would lose their jobs. The factories would
have to replace them with the same number of male workers. This would cause
extra difﬁculties for the textile industry where female workers far outnumbered
male workers. It is quite obvious that the legislators didn’t take this reality into
account while drafting Article No. 13. Besides, Fang Xianting also pointed out
that in the implementation of the Factory Law in the cotton yarn factories, the
problem of consular jurisdiction needed to be solved. Among the 133 cotton

yarn factories in China, 44 were owned by foreign investors. These
foreign-invested factories, which were located in the concessions in Shanghai
and other big cities, had the protection of consular jurisdiction, and refused to be
inspected by Chinese ofﬁcials. The universal implementation of the law was
impossible. Not all workers would receive the same protection, not all factory
owners would shoulder the same burden. Moreover, “if foreign-invested fac-
tories didn’t obey the laws of China, they would have unreasonable advantage
over the Chinese factories, making it difﬁcult for Chinese factories to compete
with them. In the mean time, the workers will face unequal treatment.”29
4. The establishment of the “factory regime” is essential for the formation of
industrial organizations. Examining the organizational form of the factory from
a micro perspective offers us an understanding of the structural and institutional
effects of rapid overall social changes. In the mean time it also reveals some
special characteristics of this new organizational form taking root in the
indigenous society. In this period, the scholars’ inquiry on the factory system
was conducted in two main directions. The ﬁrst was a critique of the factory
system that combined traditional feudal elements and modern capital exploita-
tion. The second was to explore how to establish an industrial organizational
form suitable for China through incorporating traditional institutional resources.
In these scholarly works, the strongest criticism was leveled against the “in-
dentured laborer system.” “The indentured laborer system was a system that
sold labor for ﬁxed time of service. It originated from the early labor contract
system. In the 1930s, the indentured laborer system was ﬁrst adopted by
Japanese-invested cotton yarn factories including Gongda, Xihe, Naigai Wata
Kaisha, etc. Later it was widely adopted by many Chinese and foreign-invested
textile factories and silk ﬁlatures. In the Japanese-invested cotton yarn factories,
language barriers caused difﬁculties in production coordination and command.
To solve the problem, the workshop tasks were contracted to labor contractors,
who then indentured laborers to do the work. There was only an indirect
employment relationship between the factory and the workers. As for the
recruitment of laborers, the labor contractors selected girls from poor families in
the neighboring provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, or rural areas near Shanghai.
The girls were generally aged between 12 and 15. Written or spoken indentures
were made between the contractors and their parents. Generally the laborers
would serve a term of 2–3 years for a total payment of 20–40 yuan in install-
ment or lump sum. During the service term, the laborers should work in the
factories. They were given food, shelter and clothes by the contractor. All their
wages belonged to the contractor, who would not be held responsible if they
should fall sick or die.”30
In 1932, it took Sun Yefang more than 3 months to carry out an indirect study of
the indentured laborers though investigating other workers. He published a
29ibid. p. 1451.
30See Shen (1998).

Introduction

paper entitled “Indentured laborers in the textile factories in Shanghai.”31 Sun
Yefang regarded the indentured laborer system as “one of the pre-capitalist labor
forms in the modern Chinese society.” He especially emphasized that the most
developed form of the indentured laborer system existed in the Japanese-
invested cotton yarn factories in Shanghai. In the semi-colonial Chinese society
where productivity was extremely backward, it was not surprising to ﬁnd such
remnant of the slavery system. What’s surprising was that this remnant existed
in the factories set up by an advanced capitalist country—Japan. After another
investigation of the indentured laborer system in the Japanese cotton yarn fac-
tories in Shanghai,Chen Hansheng drew a conclusion similar to Sun Yefang’s.
He pointed out that the indentured laborer system was a unique phenomenon in
the development of modern labor employment system in China. Both Sun
Yefang and Chen Hansheng attributed the development of this system to
China’s semi-colonial society.32
If studies on the indentured laborer system revealed an extreme form of
exploitation in the urban textile industry, scholars at the time also explored other
unique industrial organizational forms different from the typical form of capitalist
exploitation. In the 1930s, Wu Zhi and Fang Xianting carried out a study on the
rural weaving industry in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province. The objective of this
study was to explore the plausibility of adopting the rural industry model in
China’s modernization. The so-called “merchant employer system,” or part-timer
system, operates in this way. First, a businessman gives out all the necessary raw
materials. Then, the village coordinator organizes production, in which the family
serves as the basic unit. After production is ﬁnished, the ﬁnal products are handed
over to the businessman.33 Wu Zhi and Fang Xianting meticulously combed and
analyzed various aspects of the weaving industry under the merchant employer
system in Gaoyang, including production organization, purchasing of raw mate-
rials, marketing of the products, ﬁnancing, etc. They even went a step further to
compare the weaving industry in Gaoyang and the cotton weaving industry in
Britain before the Industrial Revolution. Their study pointed out that on the one
hand the merchant employer system in Gaoyang was highly adaptable to the
changing environment, and was capable of pulling through many crises; on the
other hand, it often fell victim to individualism. “Whenever it came to an issue
concerning public interests, the system was found to be in extreme want of
organizational power and concerted action.”34 Neither among the merchants nor
among the part-timer weavers was there good organization. To offer a solution,
they proposed that a cooperative system should be set up to compensate for the
31Sun (1998, pp. 27–36).
32In a study in the 1980s, Han Qilan queried the validity of this view. She believes that the Green
Gang’s power in Shanghai and its grasp of the labor market were the root causes of the indentured
laborer system. See Han (1987, pp. 129–138).

drawbacks of the merchant employer system, so that this kind of rural industry
could continue to exist and play a role in organizing the local society.
The above proposal was quite similar to Fei Xiaotong’s theory of rural industry.
Having got much inﬂuence from Fei Xiaotong at “Kuige,” Shi Guoheng con-
ducted a ﬁeld research of an ordnance factory in Kunming, and proposed a
somewhat different factory organizational system. Shi’s study did not focus on
formal organizational systems, but on informal organizations in the factory. He
found that great differences existed among the workers, who can be classiﬁed
into unskilled laborers, assistant workers, skilled workers, etc. Because of such
differences in background and status, the workers formed social circles among
themselves. Besides, separation also existed between the workers and the
managerial staff as a result of the traditional notion of social hierarchy which
distinguished physical labor from mental labor. Under Emile Durkheim’s
inﬂuence, Shi regarded the factory as a social organization. He pointed out that
compared with the manual workshop under apprenticeship; the new form of
factory couldn’t enhance traditional social cohesion. In the book’s long post-
script written by Fei Xiaotong, Fei used the term, “social disintegration caused
by the rise of new industry,” to name such a phenomenon. He said, “The setting
up of a factory does not only mean erecting buildings and installing machines,
but also means forming a new type of social organization. All the participators
in such an industrial organization must have a high degree of harmony.” He
believed that a high degree of harmony existed in the traditional society where
agriculture and manufacturing complemented each other. He said, “harmony
truly existed in the traditional society in the past, where every individual could
fully grasp the meaning of life.” “But new technologies could not be applied in
such traditional forms of organization. New technologies required precise
division of labor, and have extended the scope of the interdependent community
to the whole population.” “The new-born factory organization cannot form
social cohesion in the traditional sense.”35 Shi and Fei revealed a classical
dilemma for China’ modern transition. For any social change, if the new
organizational system cannot achieve a high degree of harmony among all its
participators, if the new social system cannot achieve effective integration with
the existing social conﬁguration, the society will continue to grope in darkness
for a suitable path of development yet to be found.

1.4
Towards a Full-Scale Revolution
However, in the eyes of the Marxist scholars of that era, the above-mentioned social
construction schemes were based only on analyzing the industrial organizations and
their structural effects. These schemes’ starting point was labor-capital contradictions.
Their problem was similar to lookingat the trees but ignoring the forest. The root cause
of the emergence of modern industrial organizations and employment-based class
relations in China did not lie in the organizational form of the enterprise, nor in the
collapse of the traditional social order. The appearance of a labor class and the
entailing class conﬂicts were not caused by a single factor, but the result of multiple
oppressions of the Chinese society in politics, economy and culture. In politics, the
colonialist campaigns of the imperialist powers imposed various unequal institutions
on China, which extended the plundering of China into all ﬁelds of its social economy.
The plundering was not conﬁned within the enterprise, but extended over the vast rural
areas and even the whole nation. In economy, massive capital invasion manifested
itself as the uttermost and superlative exploitation of labor, no matter in industrial and
agricultural production or in commercial activities. In terms of tangible social and
cultural operation mechanisms, the feudal forces were still upholding and strength-
ening class orders and dependence relations, and to a great extent served as vassals
assisting the colonialist and capitalist forces.
In his book, Imperialist Industrial Capital and Chinese Peasants, Chen
Hansheng reported a study on the operation of British and American tobacco
companies in China. These companies carefully studied and gradually controlled
the raw tobacco market in China, manipulated tobacco prices and labor costs,
monopolized the international tobacco market. The book presented vivid descrip-
tions of how an international trust manipulated factors like national sovereignty,
local feudal forces, commercial market, land rent and so on, to extract and maxi-
mize political and economic proﬁts in China.
To introduce the tobacco plant into China, the British and American tobacco
companies ﬁrst tried to foster consumer market in China by giving out cigarettes for
free in the big cities. Then, through cooperating with international ﬁnancial oligarchs,
they set up factories in China to take advantage of the cheap raw materials and cheap
labor in the local areas. In the mean time, they made use of their special privileges in
the ﬁve treaty ports. For example, they used some most-favored-nation clauses to
expand tobacco planting areas and monopolize tobacco sales. Besides, they mobilized
the local gentry and compradors though payment-in-kind loans and cooperatives,
expanded tobacco planting areas and sales areas by taking advantage of the govern-
ments’ policy of “helping the countryside,” and established a massive network for
buying out raw tobacco. By the late 1930s, they had largely established a monopoly
over tobacco plantation, tobacco purchase, cigarette manufacturing and cigarette sales
in China. Although tobacco planters enjoyed a higher nominal income than other
peasants, because of the high level of labor intensiveness and complexity of pro-
duction processes, whole families were often forced into highly intensive labor, while
their wage payments were often delayed. Due to the instability of the tobacco market,
1.4

15

the planters could not get their wages in time, and usurious loans further victimized
them. According to Chen Hansheng, it’s just because of this colonialist economic
pattern that the exploitation by the imperialist ﬁnancial capital, industrial capital and
commercial capital could go beyond the factories and radiate over vast rural areas. As
a result, huge numbers of peasants were forced to give up the old production mode and
showed increasing signs of industrialization and pauperization. “No matter how much
surplus labor it cost, each kind of tobacco brought foreign ﬁnancial capital generous
proﬁt returns, and provided more opportunities of exploitation for Chinese landlords,
merchants and usurers.”36
In the same vein, Chen Hansheng agreed with Mao Zedong’s judgment on the
situation of China at that time in “On coalition government”: “If politics is not
reformed, no production can escape the fate of destruction. Agriculture cannot, nor
can industry.” “In a semi-colonial, semi-feudal and fractured China, many people
dreamed about developing industry, constructing national defense, improving
people’s welfare, many people dreamed of a powerful and prosperous China. These
dreams were all disillusioned.”37
As Mao pointed out, under the double oppression of feudalism and imperialism,
the development of Chinese industry was always distorted. Both its agriculture and
industry were under the oppression of feudal forces and imperialist capitals, thus
could not have healthy and sustained development. Yan Zhongping explained the
process of this kind of double plundering, taking China’s textile industry as an
example. In the 1880s, textile products from the Western capitalist countries
ﬂooded the Chinese market, and occupied the ﬁrst position on the list of China’s
imported goods. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, in order to compete
with Britain and India for cotton yarn market share in China, the Japanese gov-
ernment exempted the Japanese textile companies from raw cotton import tax and
cotton yarn export tax, granted loans of 3 million yen from the Yokohama Specie
Bank in 1897 and 1898. It also adopted a series of sales-prompting measures, such
as lowering transportation fees for cotton yarn bound for China and giving it
carriage priority. Besides, the Japanese government instituted a system for
rewarding and subsidizing cotton yarn export to China. The Japanese bought huge
amounts of raw cotton from China, transported it to Japan, made cotton yarn out of
it and then sold the yarn back to China, reaping huge amounts of added value in the
process. At the same time, they inﬂicted heavy blows on the budding Chinese
national textile industry and the manual textile industry in rural China through
unfair competition in both the raw material market and manufactured goods market.
Yan Zhongping reported that the survival condition of the Chinese yarn factories
could be candidly described as “picking up the leftovers after foreign yarn carved
up the Chinese market.” “From 1894 to 1899, the Japanese were still experimenting
on dumping to China, and the Chinese yarn factories could maintain considerable
prosperity. But after 1899, the Japanese goods made rapid advances, prosperity

Introduction

disappeared … After the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), the Japanese had no
energy to attend to China, so that Chinese import of cotton yarn plummeted, and
prosperity returned to the Chinese yarn factories. But after that the Japanese yarn
came back, prosperity disappeared again.”38
In 1929, the world economic crisis broke out, but it didn’t spread to China
immediately. In foreign countries, the silver prices rose faster than commodity prices.
But in China, the commodity prices rose. In 1931, Britain and Japan gave up the gold
standard, causing the purchasing power of silver to increase, which affected China’s
foreign trade. China’s commodity prices fell. On the one hand, import surplus
occurred in 1932 in China, causing severe silver outﬂow. And the rural areas’ income
shrank as a result of the “price scissors.” On the other hand, the cities’ trade surplus
against the rural areas led to the piling up of silver in the cities. Silver ﬁlled the bank
vaults in the big cities, especially in Shanghai, while the inland suffered from silver
shortage and credit contraction, resulting in stoppage of commodity circulation. With
silver brimming over in Shanghai, speculative activities increased. In 1934, the United
States congress passed the Silver Purchase Act, resulting in increase of silver prices all
over the world. In 1931, China suffered from frequent ﬂoods. After the September
18th Incident in 1931, trade was cut off between the Northeast and the rest of China.
After the January 28th Shanghai Incident in 1932, accounts were left unsettled, loans
were suspended, and private banking houses went bankrupt. In the same year, the
puppet Manchu regime came into power in the Northeast; the cotton market there
dwindled, with sales diminishing and prices plummeting.
From Yan Zhongping’s study, we can catch a glimpse of the hardship that
China’s industrial economy experienced. In fact, from many studies in economic
history we can clearly see that under the oppression of imperialism and feudalism,
the exploitative nature of capital not only manifested itself within the emerging
industrial organizations, but also affected China’s traditional industries, including
agriculture, handicraft industries, and others. In this broader scope, peasants,
handicraftsmen, merchants, even China’s national enterprises became victims of
exploitation.39 The proletariat and the other oppressed classes produced diversiﬁed
class forms, each starting from their own cultural forms, clanship relations and party
politics.40 The most revolutionary among these is the road of Chinese revolution
proposed by the communists.
In his article, “On new democracy,” Mao Zedong referred to the politics and
economy in the past as “old politics” and “old economy.” He stated, “It is precisely
against these predominant political, economic and cultural forms that our revolution
is directed. What we want to get rid of is the old colonial, semi-colonial and
semi-feudal politics and economy, and the old culture in their service. And what we
want to build is their direct opposite, i.e., the new politics, the new economy and the
new culture of the Chinese nation.” He believed that in order to solve the series of

social problems in China’s modernization process, political revolution, that is,
revolution in production relations, must go ﬁrst. This did not mean adjustment, but
thorough and complete change. Therefore, the nature of this revolution was dif-
ferent from that of previous ones. “In this era, any revolution in a colony or
semi-colony that is directed against imperialism, i.e., against the international
bourgeoisie or international capitalism, no longer comes within the old category of
the bourgeois-democratic world revolution, but within the new category. It is no
longer part of the old bourgeois, or capitalist, world revolution, but is part of the
new world revolution, the proletarian-socialist world revolution.”41
This revolutionary route combined anti-imperialism with anti-capitalism, the
anti-imperialist national revolution dominating the anti-capitalist economic revo-
lution. To the revolutionists, the infringement of China’s sovereignty was consistent
with capital invasion and market invasion. The so called colonization was the result
of a combination of political, economic and cultural means. Such means must be
thoroughly removed. At the same time, anti-feudalism was also an indispensable
part of the political revolution. To build a new society, all remaining feudal ele-
ments must be removed. Through an agrarian revolution and redistribution of
production means, labor value will become the basis of production relations, not
capital. Based on this, Mao proposed a revolutionary social construction scheme. In
the section, “the economy of new democracy,” Mao pointed out, “the big banks and
the big industrial and commercial enterprises shall be owned by the state.” “The
republic will take certain necessary steps to conﬁscate the land of the landlords and
distribute it to those peasants who have little or no land. It will implement Dr. Sun
Yat-sen’s slogan of ‘land to the tiller’, abolish feudal relations in the rural areas, and
turn the land into private properties of the peasants.” In sum, “China’s economy
must develop along the path of the ‘regulation of capital’ and the ‘equalization of
landownership’, and must never be ‘privately owned by the few’; we must never
permit the few capitalists and landlords to ‘dominate the livelihood of the people’;
we must never establish a capitalist society of the European-American type or allow
the old semi-feudal society to survive. Whoever dares to go counter to this line of
advance will certainly not succeed but will run into a brick wall.”42
As the above analyses have shown, several dimensions of the social political
construction of the People’s Republic of China were established. The ﬁrst was the
transition toward an all-round public-owned economy, with the “regulation of
capital” and “equalization of landownership” as the starting points. The second was
a super-rational management system for operating such an economic form. The
entire economy should be contained and operated within such a gigantic and uniﬁed
organization. The whole country needed an overall system to construct a
pyramid-like system of governance, and needed to carry out socialist rule-of-virtue
through establishing new knowledge systems and new social morale.

Introduction

Chapter 2
Possession, Operation and Governance:
An Attempt at Theoretical Interpretation
This chapter attempts to analyze the relationship between the enterprise organiza-
tion and its members under China’s particular political system from the perspective
of three dimensions, i.e., possession, operation and governance. Theoretically
speaking, the enterprise, as a special form of organization, is composed of three
dimensions—possession, operation and governance. The political, economic and
social characteristics of the enterprise are manifested through these three dimen-
sions. They also form the enterprise’s unique power structure, power relations and
operating mechanisms. In fact, the three dimensions determine the essential qual-
ities of the enterprise, not just deﬁning its organizational structure, institutional
arrangement, and resource allocation, but also exerting great inﬂuences on the
members’ identity and qualiﬁcation, forms of rights, and behavioral patterns. All
these are key factors determining the members’ participation within the enterprise.
2.1
Possession
Both from a theoretical perspective and from the perspective of concrete history,
“possessing,” as a notion, appeared earlier than “property” (property rights).
According to the classical deﬁnition by John Locke, based on the concept of natural
laws, the Creator bestowed upon humans everything in the natural world for them
to use and possess. Humans can use their ability, personality and possession for the
continuation of life. Therefore, the freedom to act and use our bodies and pos-
sessions is a precondition for sustaining life. Private possession is something that all
humans are entitled to. It’s human being’s natural right.1 As is pointed out by
Laslett, in Locke’s time, “property” and “propriety” were used interchangeably.
Because of man’s desire of having more than they need, if the right of possession
was not established, disputes would rise inevitably, the workers would face the

possibility of losing the products of their labor.2 As a result, property right became a
fundamental right in the laws. Protecting property rights helps avoid inequality in
possession caused by power abuse. But it is also made possible that people may
gain the rights of possession without doing the work.
2.1.1
Three Ideal Models of Possession
There are three ideal models of “possession”: private ownership, public ownership
and common ownership.3
Private ownership: John Locke’s dilemma of possession formed the basic the-
oretical structure for discussing capital-labor relationship in later times. For
example, in The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism: Hobbes to Locke,
Macpherson thinks that property rights determine the basic rights of the owners and
employers of the enterprise and deﬁne its power structure through possession of
“capital-objects.”4 The enterprise is just the modern organizational form where such
natural equality and social inequality of rights take place. In this sense, many people
think that the essence of the enterprise organization is a series of relationships of
ownership, or a structure of ownership formed by a series of contracts.5
Generally speaking, the form of possession based on private ownership is the
theoretical basis of classical liberalism. Through the deﬁnition of ownership either
by acquisition or by inheritance, the premise of unequal possession of wealth was
acknowledged. The dominant position of the private ownership was also estab-
lished in the enterprise. As a result, the operation of the enterprise mostly aims at
promoting “self-interest” and follows the principles of capital accumulation and
proﬁt maximization. From the perspective of the law, the owner makes their own
decisions concerning their rights and transfer of rights. Although these may also be
done through agency appointment and other methods, the ﬁnal subject of rights is
still the owner. In this ideal type, the rights within the enterprise do not have forms
of division, that is, ownership has the quality of monopoly, and is strictly exclusive.
The free enterprise system and corporate governance were established on this basis,
which means the possessor’s “legal monopoly” of the enterprise organization. It’s
worth noting that in its ideal form, private ownership has legal implications for
constitutionalism, holding both economic and political signiﬁcance. Therefore, in a
free economy, the enterprise organizations constitute the main body of the
2Locke (1989).

Demsetz (1999).

socio-economic structure, form market exchange relationships with one another,
and basically rely on contracts to operate and control such relationships.6
Public ownership: Based upon criticisms over the theories of private ownership
mentioned above, the socialists’ conception of a proper social form is to contain the
production of the whole society in a rationalized resource redistribution structure.
Therefore, the power structure of public ownership system is based on possession
by all. It does not put capital accumulation at the ﬁrst place, but prioritizes equal
rights for all and builds protective mechanisms for that. The transfer of rights is
carried out through a system of representation7 or a centralized government, on the
basis of which the enterprise’s basic power structure and highest organ of authority
are established. Thus, at the kernel of the public ownership economy are move-
ments of distribution and redistribution, i.e. the level-by-level transfer of
“capital-objects” through a central authority.
However, the ideology of public ownership designates the whole people as the
owner, the whole people is the only personality basis of ownership. Therefore, in
the concrete economic process, it is through the agents (representative) in the
level-by-level delegation that the processes of production, exchange and circulation,
which are determined by the planning system of redistribution, are completed. Here,
only bureaucratic governments can meet the requirement of possessing such
hyper-rationality8 and executive efﬁciency. Therefore, the governments at all levels
become the main agents of ownership rights, and take the place of the enterprises to
serve as operators in the socio-economic operations. We can see this clearly in the
researches on the danwei system.9 Szelényi holds that the characteristics of the
redistribution system are not the same as the free economic system. The redistri-
bution system does not maximize production as the market economic system does,
but minimizes personal consumption to ensure collective consumption. Thus, the
decision-making power in consumption will be transferred from the individual
consumers to the hands of the government, and the surplus amount will be trans-
ferred from proﬁtable enterprises to unproﬁtable enterprises through redistribution,
so as to protect equal rights between the enterprises.10 Kornai maintains that
redistributors often try to maximize the surplus amount under their control, so as to
6For this reason, Western economists often use contracts/exclusivity and market/transaction costs
as the basic concepts of property rights analysis. Polanyi has a very brilliant discussion on this. See
Polanyi (1957).
7In the thirty years after the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the system of workers’
congress in the state-owned enterprises was a system of representation. In the ideal situation, the
internal operation of the enterprise was entirely dependent on the relationships, institutions and
mechanisms of participation at the various levels. The workers, as the subject of ownership rights,
could transfer their rights in management and governance to their representatives, who were
elected to implement the highest decisions of the enterprise.

expand their redistribution power.11 In this way, just like individual rationality of
the private ownership, which fails to work in the face of an enormous market and
leads to cyclical economic crises, the singular personality of public ownership will
have difﬁculty in supporting the operation of an enormous economy simply by
relying on the central government’s planning rationality. It is the anarchy of
planning that has replaced the anarchy of market.12
Common ownership: Different from private ownership and public ownership,
the common ownership system generally emphasizes a community’s traditional
customs and cultural resources. In this system, the enterprise organization is
believed to have similar structural characteristics with traditional organizations like
churches, fellowships, guilds, village communities or family communities, being
established on the basis of common ownership. Take Emile Durkheim’s “corpo-
ration” as an example.13 It is different from both the capitalist approach, which uses
clear property rights to deﬁne the enterprise organization, and the socialist
approach, which determines that the property rights of the enterprise belong to the
working class and all the people. Comparatively speaking, it puts more emphasis on
the concept of members in the community. It holds that the yardstick for dis-
tributing rights or power should depend on the natural division of labor or labor
division system formed historically. This is collective possession, the purpose of
which is to maximize the average income of the members. It blurs the opposition
between capital and labor and downplays the category of state power. Instead, it
uses member status as a benchmark to implement the notion of ownership division.
The common ownership system is in a certain sense collective ownership, with
its special emphasis on social linking factors like customs, rites, common sense,
intimate relationships, etc. These are traditional moral ties, serving to bound the
members to the organization by creating a sense of belonging and identiﬁcation.
This type of enterprise organization demonstrates some non-capitalist characteris-
tics, its deﬁning quality being occupational stratiﬁcation. This model is prone to
transfer some rights of the enterprise to trade organizations, which reduce risks of
competition through trade cooperation. The trade organizations also ensure the
continuation of organizational afﬁliation and identiﬁcation, and strengthen social
ties and solidarity.14 However, as is pointed out by Demsetz, “Under the system of
common ownership, many types of costs are neglected when people try to maxi-
mize the shared ownership. An owner within the common ownership cannot
exclude others from sharing the fruit of his/her hard work. Moreover, when all the
members attempt to reach an agreement on an optimal action plan, the costs of
11See Kornai (1959).
12Kornai made observations on the “soft budget constraint” imposed by the planning system on the
state-owned enterprises, which revealed a the strange phenomenon in the operation of such an
economy. That is, unproﬁtable enterprises were still running, they continued to meet consumer
demands and guarantee full employment, resulting in excessive demands. See Kornai (1980).
13See Durkheim (2003).

negotiations are very high.”15 As a result, it is very difﬁcult for the common
ownership system to adapt to free market competition. It is also very vulnerable
when faced with the political authority of the overall system.
2.1.2
Intermediate Forms
In the history of enterprise evolution, some intermediate forms between the three
ideal models of possession have appeared since the 20th century.
The private ownership system absorbed various elements from other forms of
possession to reinvent itself. In order to sustain and develop the capitalist enterprise
system, a series of new methods were introduced, including employee stock
ownership, participatory management, sharing economy, stakeholder governance,
labor-capital cooperation and conﬂict management, etc. Transfer of rights can be
realized in three ways to different extents. Firstly, David Ellerman proposed the
“democratic corporation,” which absorbed reasonable ingredients from the public
ownership system. On the basis of the contract relationship, “it sets up a different
enterprise form, substituting the employment system with a membership system.”
This type of organization entitled the members of the enterprise who originally did
not have the rights of possession to electoral rights, and created a theory of labor
assets, which acknowledged that the enterprise members have the right to surplus
and net income. In Ellerman’s words, “the abolishment of the employment rela-
tionship has not put an end to private property, or free market, or the entrepreneur’s
authority, yet it has changed the scope and nature of these categories.”16 Although
labor, originally viewed as something to be employed, is now believed to contain
the rights of possession, the workers themselves cannot possess these rights as
properties to be purchased and sold. Their ownership is not complete. The member
status of the workers does not pose an absolute challenge to the ownership relations;
it only partially changes some ownership relations in the sense of operation and
governance, and partially changes the employment relationship.
Secondly, the theory of sharing economy refers to an organizational model
wherein workers can participate in proﬁt distribution and revenue sharing, through
cash award system, bonus system, incentive pay plan, proﬁt-sharing system,
net-income-sharing system, etc. Besides the salary income, the employees can share
the enterprise’s total revenue with its owners.17 This is an attempt at including some
elements of the common ownership economy in the private ownership system.
However, sharing economy is only an institutional arrangement for distributing the
property rights among the holders of labor capital and the holders of non-labor
capital. It’s only an arrangement for distributing business proﬁts that is different

from the payroll system (a capital exclusive system) or a labor exclusive system.
The decision-making power still belongs to owners of the capital.18 Above all,
private ownership not only can promote specialization of production, but also can
create a form of integrated social capital to expand production and other economic
activities, because of its qualities of being dividable, separable, and transferrable.
Modern joint-stock enterprises or joint-stock cooperative enterprises extend the
boundary of the organization to the whole society, and establish a collective body of
social capital, so that they are capable of aggregating sufﬁcient capital as dedicated
resource for the enterprise, and large-scale operation is possible. In the mean time,
the decision making power on such a dedicated resource is detached from the
outcome of its market value, so that specialization is achieved in both management
rights and property rights. However, because the ownership structure is determined
by the proportion of shares, equal distribution of rights is still not achieved in the
ﬁnal account, the distribution of rights is still based on property hierarchy.
Interestingly, the system of possession based on public ownership is also trying
to absorb elements from other types of systems. During the time of the Second
International, Bernstein attempted to combine the notions of market and state with
the notion of class analysis.19 The essential claims of this middle path are the
following. Based on the premise of acknowledging democracy, the essential status
of collective negotiations should be established in the legislation mechanism
through parliamentary politics on the state level. Laws concerning the protection of
workers’ rights should be enacted through the method of legislative participation.
The enterprise law should be included in the principles of the constitution, in
addition to the civil law. Within the enterprise, the workers should be allowed to
participate in enterprise decision-making through a model similar to the parlia-
mentary system, which deﬁnes the ownership structure of the enterprise and the
rights and obligations in its operation. The Social Democratic Party in later times
tried to protect the workers’ rights of ownership through multiple means other than
merely the labor contract relationship, such as parliament legislation, administration
of justice, labor unions, and enterprise parliament, etc. The purpose of such alter-
ations in the public ownership system was to decompose the principle of the whole
people ownership into the principle of workers’ ownership based on the enterprise
organization through the legal basis of constitutional government, to restore the
rights of ownership to the unit of the enterprise, so as to decrease the possibility of
autocracy under a centralized system. Besides, according to a study by Iván
Szelényi and his partners based on Eastern European experiences, the planned
economy of the public ownership system was not of a unitary nature, but contained
two sectors, one of these being the sector of redistribution which occupied the
dominant position, the other being the sector of market integration which played a
18See Liu and Zhang (2002).
19For example, Zoll believes that the trade union system is just formed on the basis of this idea,
and as a result the trade unions have a double character. That is, they function in the production
relations that already exist, they ﬁght for the basic rights of the employees through bargaining in
the existing production relations. See Zoll (1976).

subordinate role. The latter, including all kinds of small-sized state-owned,
collectively-owned and privately-owned enterprises, which ﬂourished through
market integration, formed a kind of “mixed economy” together with the large-scale
enterprises within the planning system. This type of “double circulations of accu-
mulation” diversiﬁed the overall ownership system, which brought about a host of
free-ﬂowing resources, and resolved the difﬁcult problems of consumption and
efﬁciency under the planning system. However, these so-called pluralistic forms of
ownership were eclipsed by the whole people ownership all along. They did not
have full legitimacy, especially in ideology.
Correspondingly, the common ownership system has also adjusted itself.
Corporatism still uses the enterprise organization as a starting point in determining
the ownership structure based on collective public will. However, in the mean time,
it emphasizes the mediating and adjusting functions of the enterprise organization
in the public life of communities and in governmental decision making. It
emphasizes the orderly interaction between the enterprise organization and the local
governments, and emphasizes the organizational function of state authority.20 In
this sense, corporatism believes that the enterprise organization is expanding its
scope in two directions. One is to expand the boundary of some individual enter-
prises to the scope of whole industry or whole region, creating an overall organi-
zational environment, and establishing a social cooperative system on a larger
scale.21 The second is to include itself in the system of state governance, or bundle
the local governments, the basic-level communities, and the enterprise together to
form a community of common interests and rights. The government helps the
enterprise by raising funds, providing technologies, ﬁnding sales channels, and
reducing tax burden, while the enterprise brings the government great amounts of
ﬁscal revenue and provides the community with employment opportunities and
welfare facilities. Thus a complete system of local protection can be set up.22
Obviously, in the idea of corporatism, the enterprise organization strives to obscure
and expand the boundary of its ownership structure to the maximum, so as to obtain
the biggest public advantage. This happens to give evidence to the cooperative
nature of the corporation and its dependence on the local customs and traditional
social resources for resisting the encroachments of bigger power and larger capital.
20See Zhang (2005).
21Streeck (1982, pp. 72–73).
22Some scholars use the term “beehive politics” to refer to local protectionism. See Shue (1988).

2.2
Operation
2.2.1
The Concept of Operation
If the concept of possession deﬁnes the enterprise’s nature of rights, structure and
mode of action from the perspective of politics and law, the concept of operation
constitutes another important dimension which determines the enterprise’s orga-
nizational behavior. Max Weber thinks that the modern enterprise organization, no
matter what ownership form it takes, can always be understood as the formation and
unfolding of an economic action. This kind of action is different from family
activities which focus on consumption. It is unfolded under the condition of social
organization, through the means of long-term proﬁt-making activities, and on the
basis of purposive rationality and calculation.23 Therefore, the nature of the
enterprise is enduring business operation organized in the form of a business entity.
The ﬁrst principle of the enterprise is the principle of proﬁt-making and utility. At
the core of the concept of the enterprise is capital accounting under formal reason.24
Correspondingly, an enterprise organization requires many operational prerequi-
sites: (1) accounting, accounting books and other institutional installations of
capital calculation; (2) the economic principle of free market, i.e., money as a means
of payment, and a credibility principle centered around monetary exchange; (3) the
concept of profession: formed through heteronomous distribution of labor and
provision of means of livelihood within an economic regulation group (regulated
professional division), or realized through autonomous orientation to the market
status of professional labor (free professional division); (4) the main organizational
form that combines ownership with market relations, i.e., the development of the
enterprise organization from household industry to limited customer industry
(manor system), then to free industry (guild system).25
Business operation refers to the institutions and personnel arrangement structure
formed by the enterprise in pursuit of its own beneﬁt goal. This is a crucial point
which fundamentally differentiates the enterprise from other general social areas.
23See Swedberg (2007, pp. 45–52).
24Max Weber also uses the concept of proﬁt (Erwerb) to deﬁne management, and makes a
distinction between proﬁt opportunities in the organizational sense (Erwerbschance) and market
opportunities (Marketchance). Proﬁt-making is realized through budget management (Haushalt).
See Weber (1978, p. 96).
25In this sense, Max Weber has a unique understanding of the capitalist system: (1) The entre-
preneur has exclusive control of the monetary means of operation, which is used to give workers
payment in advance; based on the entrepreneur’s production credit and right to dispose of prod-
ucts, the entrepreneur has the management rights over ﬁnancial production. (2) Based on previous
monopoly on market knowledge, the capitalist has the right to trade products; on the basis of the
exclusive group order, the capitalist has the monetary means of operation for market opportunities.
(3) The workers begin to develop internal discipline. (4) The workers are separated from the means
of production. (5) All material means of production are converted into capital. The managers are
also separated from the means of production, and formally become bureaucrats; business owners in
fact become the agents of credit providers (banks). See Weber (2005, pp. 123–124).
26

Possession, Operation and Governance: An Attempt at Theoretical …

The enterprise is a proﬁt-seeking organization. Proﬁt-making, being an essential
quality of business operation activities is to gain the opportunities for obtaining
rights of ﬁnancial disposition. The form of monetary accounting used in rational
economic proﬁt-making is called “capital accounting,” i.e., the estimation and
monitoring of proﬁt opportunities, proﬁt gains and losses. Generally speaking, the
operators are all situated in the middle and upper levels of the enterprise, playing
the roles of decision-makers, executives and supervisors at various levels. This is
closely related to the enterprise’s feature of utility. The enterprise management
structure is a kind of vertical command structure, a kind of bureaucratic system.
In this sense, the basic difference between ownership and business operation is
that the former is a fundamental structure of rights serving as a precondition for
business operation, while the latter is a series of actions centering on how to achieve
the proﬁt goal. The ownership structure determines the momentum and direction of
the owners’ economic activities, while business operation determines the rational
mechanism for achieving maximum utility in that direction. In the former, the
owners dominate the economic activities. In the latter, the whole staff dominates the
activities; in particular, actions of instrumental rationality are led by the managerial
staff with executive capacity.
2.2.2
Three Ideal Models of Operation
There are generally three ideal models of business operation, respectively, the
authoritarian model, the rule-by-law model, and the agential model.
The ﬁrst is the authoritarian model. Such quasi-patriarchal-and-military-style
enterprise organizations generally appear in the early stage of capitalism or the
start-up phase of an enterprise. The operators are the owners themselves. They use
their own conception, motivation, capital power, and individual ability to control
and realize the enterprise’s capital operation and production management. The
owners extend the exclusiveness of ownership to all areas of business operation,
and have authoritarian monopoly within the enterprise organization. Because of the
difference between private ownership forms and public ownership forms, this
authoritarian style manifests itself in different forms including autocratic rule of the
owner, government command, autocratic rule of the parent, the patriarch, or the
guild-masters in the late Middle Age, etc., the latter being the much-talked-about
traditions of paternalism and patriarchy. In this sense, whatever forms the owner-
ship takes, individual, the whole people, or collective, they all become the authority
in domination of business operation activities. The essential feature of this type is
complete integration of ownership rights and management rights. Therefore, in the
authoritarian model of business operation, commands and disciplines have the
biggest efﬁcacy. However, it’s rather questionable whether the business goals can
be rationally achieved.
The second is the rule-by-law model. According to the classic deﬁnition by
Weber, such a model can be characterized as an enterprise organization system of
2.2
Operation
27

uniﬁed leadership. It is the most rational business model, which depends on dis-
ciplines and specialized knowledge to carry out its operation. The typical system of
the rule-by-law model is the bureaucratic system, which follows the principle of
focusing on the true state of the matters. It doesn’t arrange the structure of man-
agement rights according to the structure of ownership rights, but rationally allocate
the enterprise’s resources, organizational forms and sales channels according to the
requirements of rationality, technology, and specialized knowledge. It designs its
labor division and sets up its management systems on the basis of rational orders
intrinsic to the operation links of production process, technology, circulation,
marketing, etc., in order to achieve the overall business goal. The bureaucratic
system emphasizes the spirit of formal reason, and strives to understand all the
managerial staff as knowledgeable and skilled professional talents. Such an obvious
feature of formalization puts the spirit of downplaying personal inﬂuence in the
dominant position, responsibility being detached from personal sentiments or will
powers.26 In other words, in the organizational form of the rule-by-law model, the
inherent management requirements that are reasonable and consistent with man-
agement goals have surpassed the owner’s will in decision making, because the
organizational form of the enterprise is conﬁgured on the ground of efﬁcacy in
attaining goals. Sometimes, in enterprises of sufﬁciently large scale, the real owners
and executives at the highest level seem to be absent or have an invisible existence.
Even so, business activities still go on in the prescribed order.
In the authoritarian model, ownership rights determine management rights.
However, in the rule-by-law model, ownership rights seem to have retired from
public life, leaving management rights alone in the arena. Such management rights
are not embodied in some speciﬁc individuals, but show the characteristics of
impersonalization. The bureaucratic system means conducting business operation
according to the intrinsic laws of knowledge. On the one hand, specialized
knowledge has its conventional power status. On the other hand, inside the
bureaucratic system, specialized knowledge can only be obtained within one’s own
level of expertise. The managerial staff undertaking business activities can only
accumulate experience and knowledge within their own scope of service, and try to
understand the truth of various business matters therein. They only have access to
materials available to their own professional grade. Therefore, the enterprises which
adopt the bureaucratic system have obvious features of administrativization. They
can be enterprise forms under the capitalist system. They can also be enterprise
forms under the socialist system. The rule-by-law model of enterprise organization
can appear in both the planning system and the free market system. Whether in
large-scale state-owned enterprises under the planning system or in large enterprise
groups under the market system, the internal structure is always a stylized orga-
nizational chain, with a rigid hierarchy and vertically linked levels. The overall
business goal is decomposed and allotted to speciﬁc functions at every level of the
hierarchy, and then transferred and inspected in the vertical manner. A dilemma
26See Weber (2005, pp. 307–322).
28

Possession, Operation and Governance: An Attempt at Theoretical …

thus comes into being. Because a staff member ﬁxed at a speciﬁc level is only
accountable to his or her immediate superior, no one is truly aware of the rational
and overall business goal of the whole enterprise. Although the bureaucratic system
is a vertical structural arrangement, for the executives embedded in the levels of the
system and their managerial activities, no fundamental differences exist among
them except the hierarchical status. In this regard, their differences are leveled.
The third is the agential model. The formation of the principal-agent relationship
means that the principal transforms their rights of ownership into their agent’s rights
of management. In fact, a transfer of rights is performed. As a precondition of this
business model, the owner only has the rights of ownership, and entrusts the right to
use the asset to an agent who generally does not have any right of ownership, i.e.,
the management decision-making power is handed over to the agent for execution.
In the principal-agent relationship, the identities and rights of both parties are clear,
because the ownership rights and the management rights are separate de facto, and
the management rights are transferred by the owner through contract on free will.
Difference exists between this condition and the bureaucratic system of the
rule-by-law model. In the bureaucratic system, the management rights are
decomposed into the rights of various bureaucratic levels aiming at achieving their
own managerial goals. In the agential model, the managers are given a complete
space in terms of management rights. As for contract relationship, the staff in the
bureaucratic system is only held accountable to their superior, not directly to the
owner. However, in the principal-agent relationship, the agent is directly
accountable to the principal, or owner. The principal’s goal is the maximization of
capital gains, while the agent is bound by a ﬁxed-term contract.
The reason why the owner wants to entrust their rights and why the agent can
provide agent service is that the agent has obvious comparative advantages in
management, professional expertise, and information.27 As a result, apparent
information asymmetry exists in the principal-agent relationship, which leads to
two types of outcomes. The ﬁrst is “adverse selection.” Before the contract is
signed, the principal who is disadvantaged in information cannot always make the
right choice in selecting the right agent who is of higher quality than others. The
second is “agency hazard.” After the agential contract is signed, the agent, who has
advantages in information, might take advantage of the information asymmetry to
engage in actions that are beneﬁcial to themselves but harmful to the principal.
Based on the above considerations, the principal should adopt appropriate measures
to carry out effective supervision and motivation.28 In later sections, the readers will
ﬁnd that such phenomena have been quite common in the business operation of
enterprises ever since the reform began. It should be pointed out that the
principal-agent relationship has universal existence in the society. We can ﬁnd such
a relationship between the state and the managers of state-owned enterprises

Governance
To propose the concept of governance means we cannot understand the enterprise
organization as a pure self-sufﬁcient system. On the contrary, it is embedded within
the overall social structure and the nation’s institutional environment. Especially
when it is still developing in a non-standardized, changeable state of transition, its
ownership relations and management relations are to a greater degree inﬂuenced by
the social economic system, ideology and social customs. As the third important
dimension in the study of the enterprise organization, the analysis of governance
should start from the core concept of “embeddedness.” Liu Shiding quoted Karl
Polanyi as saying, “the human economy is embedded and enmeshed in institutions,
economic and noneconomic. The inclusion of the noneconomic is vital. For religion
or government may be as important for the structure and functioning of the
economy as monetary institutions or the availability of tools and machines them-
selves that lighten the toil of labor.”29 Douglass C. North, expounding on the
subject of change in economic history, remarked, “in order to explain economic
organization, theories of transaction costs and theories of governance must be
applied together.” “Without a clear theory of ideology, or a theory of knowledge
sociology in a broader sense, our capacity for explaining current resource allocation
and historical change will be very insufﬁcient.”30 In his analysis of ownership,
Demsetz also used “the social responsibility of enterprise economy” and “morality
in property rights systems” as the starting points.31 All these indicate that the
concept of “governance” has gone far beyond the paradigm of legal person and
legal rights in the so-called “corporate governance.” It requires us to incorporate the
state system and its policies and movements, knowledge power and governance
expertise, traditional resources such as family ethics and clan relations, the foun-
dation of social mores, etc., into an expanded study of corporate behaviors.
2.3.1
Regime Governance
“Regime” refers to a normalized system of governance deﬁned by national will and
constitution in politics, economy, and ideology. According to Montesquieu, it

implements the principle of the general spirit.32 Whether it’s a constitutional state or
an authoritarian state, they all have the characteristics of overallness. Any economic
behavior or economic rule, any enterprise activity, cannot be divorced from such an
overall institutional environment. As is pointed out by Polanyi, the analysis can
only be carried out with an overall method. Only when put in the historical and
social background of contact with the overall social system, can speciﬁc economic
systems be explained.33 Through examining the economic history, Polanyi found
that in 19th century Britain only through the double effects of government inter-
vention and free market principle, did the commercialization of land, labor and
capital take place. On the one hand, land, labor and capital, far from being com-
modities, were managed and allocated through non-economic agencies. On the
other hand, under the inﬂuence of the imaginary free market concept, the factory
owners factitiously called labor, land and capital commodities, incorporated
industrial management into a conceptualized market to expand the scope of
exchange at equal values, and tried to enhance self-protection through managing the
market on their own.34 Therefore, the so-called “self-adjusting market” is not
self-sufﬁcient, but has to go through a process of “de-embedding” that combines
industrial production, government intervention and the free market concept. Not
only that its formation process is subject to the intervention of system factors, but
also that its self-protection can only be achieved with the system as its opposite.
Polanyi’s study actually disclosed a dialectic relationship. In the interaction
between organizational activity and state system, the enterprise needs to draw
support from the allocation of institutional resources, and in the mean time it also
needs to form a kind of opposition with the state system to maintain its own
independence. In essence, this is a kind of embedded relationship. However,
embedded relationship is different from dependency relationship. Polanyi’s inves-
tigation of economic history had its premise of political system. That is, in
19th-century Britain, the constitutional monarchy gave living space to individual
ownership and management rights, and facilitated the spread of the free market
ideology. Comparatively speaking, Iván Szelényi fully developed Polanyi’s theory
of redistribution. “In fact, using Polanyi’s terms, perhaps it’s more accurate to
describe China in this way. In China’s social structure, with a centralized redis-
tribution hierarchy and various province-level and intra-provincial markets, local
societies of state socialism were established.”35 This remark is about China’s
system setup in the 1980s. However, even in the most typical, most rigid socialist
systems before that, in addition to the redistribution system which occupied the
dominant position, a second economy also existed in various forms of brightness or
32See Montesquieu (1993 p. 305).
33In fact, in the theoretical structure of Polanyi, reciprocity, redistribution and market exchange are
the three dimensions of economic organization. It is just because different countries have different
institutional structures that these three dimensions are interrelated in different ways. See Polanyi
(1971).

darkness, resulting in the “double circulations of accumulation.” That is, “a dom-
inant sector was made up of large enterprises integrated by the central planning
system. In the mean time, there also existed a private sector of a considerable size
but a subordinate position, which was made up of smaller enterprises integrated by
the market.”36 This situation could be found in Eastern Europe and other countries
with similar systems.
In theory, Polanyi and Szelényi are not fundamentally different. They both
emphasized that people cannot indulge in infatuation with the myth of the dominant
system. In the countries dominated by a free system, the market principle of
equivalent exchange is in fact embedded in complex political and social systems.
But in the countries dominated by the planning system, there also exist an enormous
second economy and a huge consumer market. Even the system of redistribution
cannot have lasting existence without the compliment and coordination of the
latter.37 Conversely, Polanyi and Szelényi’s studies also indicate that no system
could exist independently; whether it is a market system, or an enterprise organi-
zation system, or a gigantic state system, they all need to be embedded with other
systems for survival. The process of embedding is nevertheless a dynamic process.
As is disclosed by Polanyi, between the market system and the state system is
actually a relationship of “embeddedness” and “de-embeddedness.” Its formation
process needs the state and other non-economic factors to give effective distribu-
tion; it also spontaneously produces social protective responses, and manage to
sustain its own system through social movements. Similarly, in the socialist system,
the state, besides implementing conventional bureaucratic governance, needs the
mechanism to constantly set off a variety of institutional movements,38 to control
and mobilize various social factors.
In a research paper on “mobilizational governance mechanism,” Zhou Xueguang
points out, “The conventional mechanism and the mobilizational mechanism con-
tradict and at the same time complement each other. Only when the conventional
mechanism fails and leads to organizational failure, can people begin to understand
the mobilizational governance mechanism.”39 The starting point of this analysis is
not unrelated to Polanyi’s proposition. The difference lies in that the initiator is the
state. As to the speciﬁc process of regime governance, the existence of an “em-
bedded relationship” hinders the gigantic bureaucratic system from effective
operation in accordance with its rationally designed program; hierarchy and divi-
sion of labor can easily lead to difﬁculty in information ﬂow; moreover, regional
differences require this system to remain ﬂexible, which intensiﬁes the mutual

movements initiated and organized by all levels of governments and departments in order to
accomplish a speciﬁc political, economic or other type of task. See Shizheng (2011).

suspicion and risk of losing control between superiors and subordinates.40
Therefore, mobilizational governance is actually a process of “de-embedding,” that
is, to break the level-by-level responsibility system formed by intertwining rela-
tionships of loyalty, trust and patronage between the superiors and subordinates, so
as to enhance the political effectiveness of the national will and amplify the impact
of state ideology. To quote Zhou Xueguang’s words, the mobilization mechanism
in political movements “needs to go beyond the scope of conventional emergency
mobilization, and break the existing organizational structure.”41The difference
between mobilizational governance and conventional bureaucratic governance lies
not only in that it should have sufﬁcient “arbitrary power” to fully mobilize the
power of ideology and even the state apparatus of dictatorship to transform various
administrative problems into political problems, but also in that it should be able to
fully mobilize local political resources,42 even expand the scope of political
mobilization to almost all common citizens. James N. Rosenau said it very well,
“Governance is a system of rules that will only be accepted by the majority.”43
In conclusion, a governance system surely has features of an overall structure,
but cannot be purely understood as being structural. From the perspective of the
operating mechanism of a governance system, the formation of any system has the
feature of “embeddedness.” Whether it is a free market economic system, or a
redistribution economic system, it does not exist in isolation, but needs to be
embedded with other systems for survival. Similarly, in the superior-subordinate
relationship inside the system, or in the central-local relationship, embeddedness
also exists, which leads to their own self-protective responses, and to the formation
of a ﬂexible governance space that cannot be fully contained in the overall sys-
tem.44 Any kind of dominant system will face the difﬁcult problem of structural
failures caused by embedding, and needs to adopt more intense mobilizational
governance with comprehensive coverage, to “de-embed” the original embedded
relationship, and to periodically enhance the strength and effectiveness of the
system will. In this sense, a system of governance is never merely a rigid structural
hierarchy, but a changeable dynamic mechanism.
2.3.2
Knowledge Governance
On the one hand, to propose the concept of “embeddedness” means that no unitary
system is self-sufﬁcient. The system must fully engage in the dynamic process of
“embedding” and “de-embedding,” and develop multiple governance systems.

On the other hand, the non-self-sufﬁciency of regime governance is also reﬂected in
the fact that it not only relies on mandatory institutional functions or institutional
norms, but also needs a complete set of programs, techniques, and knowledge. In
other words, whether it is conventional governance or mobilizational governance,
they all need both parties of governance to use a set of internalizable knowledge
and technology, and even consensual identiﬁcation, to achieve the efﬁcacy of
governance in ideology.
In “Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism,” Weber did not emphasize
which sect has the doctrines, theories and ethics that are the most conducive to
cultivating trust in market transactions, but that only through becoming a member
of a Protestant sect, that is, to stand the sacred test in isolation from the earthly
world and go through moral toughening, can the excellent qualities cultivated inside
such “voluntary religious associations” be converted into credit in economic
activities. In other words, in American economic history, the formation of com-
mercial credit did not depend on the market system; rather, a typical middle class
businessman had to ﬁrst put his credit value under adequate test through disciplined
self-governance within the sect, before he could gain “legitimacy in various aspects
of private and social life,” and in turn obtain irreplaceable commercial opportuni-
ties. “Only the organized way of life of the ascetic sects can legalize individualism
in the modern capitalist ethos as the driving force of economy, and give it glory.”45
Weber’s study on Protestant sects provided a very interesting topic for discus-
sion. The source of the legitimacy of regime governance does not come from the
institutional standards stipulated by the system itself, but very probably comes from
the governance process within a different ﬁeld (religion is also a social ﬁeld). This
latter process often unfolds under deeper and more internal ethical requirements
such as knowledge value, belief motivation, etc., so that it is easier for the par-
ticipants to obtain trust and gain success in worldly economic life. Similarly,
Foucault, in his investigation of the modern governance process in the West since
the 17th century, pointed out, “From the perspective of governance, what’s
important is not law.” “The tool of governance is no longer conﬁned to the law, but
includes a series of tactics in various forms.”46 “Governmentality” was an important
concept in Foucault’s research on governance.
After examining Machiavelli and his follower’s theories, especially the doctrines
of mercantilism, Foucault pointed out that, in the past, state governance only
focused on the governance of territories, it has now encompassed all aspects of
“governing people and affairs” in the overall governance structure, and has estab-
lished three basic forms of governance. “Each of these three forms is concerned
with a particular subject of science or discipline. The art of self-governance is
related to ethics; the art of proper family governance is related to economy (do-
mestic); the art of state governance is related to political science.”47 In this sense,
45See Weber (2010, p. 140).
46See Foucault (2001, 2010, p. 79).

the modern system combines the governance of people with the governance of
affairs, establishes a series of governance systems integrating people’s wealth,
resources, livelihood, customs, habits, behavioral and thinking patterns, even dis-
asters like famines, epidemics and deaths, etc., putting both private life and orga-
nizational life into the category of “public utility.” Foucault noted, “with the
appearance of mercantilism, we for the ﬁrst time see the development of “saivor”
about the state which might be used as a tactic of governance.” In the mean time,
“saivor” is not the same with “system.” As a type of govermentality, it not only
provides the governing body with a more legitimate ideological tool, but also
provides the governed with space for discourse and expression with subjective
colors. As a result, subtle relationships of domination and resistance are formed
within the governance system.48
For instance, Guo Yuhua and Sun Liping’s research on “pouring out woes”
revealed a governance mechanism about how to reshape the common people’s
national concept through knowledge and techniques.49 In the land-reform move-
ment in the early 1950s, the peasants’ sufferings in daily life were extracted through
the technique of “pouring out woes,” to construct knowledge of class division and a
revolutionary discourse, so as to reconstruct the relationship between the peasants
and the surrounding world, especially the relationship between the peasants and the
state. In fact, this was also a process of shaping the peasants as the subject of
discourse. In other words, only through this process of knowledge-making, could
abstract ideology be converted into the internal subject awareness of the vast
peasantry, and relate them to the greater concept of the nation, so that the political
will of the nation could be implemented through effective self-governance of the
peasants. As we will discuss later, in the process of social transformation from the
revolutionary system to the reform system, tactics like “the household contract
system” and “the ﬁnancial contract system” were extremely important for knowl-
edge and discourse transformation. They served as preconditions for achieving
“ideological emancipation” and “structural mutation” in governance.
2.3.3
Mores Governance
Concerning the theory of governance, there is an intriguing tension between
Polanyi and Foucault’s expositions. Polanyi emphasizes the overall system envi-
ronment, but thinks that because of the existence of “embeddedness,” no system is
an impenetrable wall, and an opposition to the system will be formed. But Foucault
emphasizes the generation of knowledge and techniques in governance, which
permeates every corner of the society, where all the factors are gathered in a diffuse
knowledge/power system. Frankly speaking, these two theories are all aimed at the

typical systems of the West. For the Chinese society in the transformation process,
it is impossible either to have a self-protecting mechanism different and indepen-
dent from the dominant system, or to construct a knowledge system that can
integrate all social elements. Because the “Chinese experience” in governance has
the characteristics of immaturity and uncertainty, large survival space is left to
non-system or non-formally-institutional factors. At the early stage of social
transformation, these factors even played a signiﬁcant role in governance because
of the “shortage of institutions.”
As far as the Western institutional history is concerned, Western capitalism also
went through a bumpy and twisty road of development. In The Spirit of the Laws,
Montesquieu put forward a creative insight. If we start from “laws,” that is, “the
necessary relations arising from the nature of things,” to explore the basic principles
of state operation, we should not only investigate the nature of the regime, i.e., the
institutional structure of the system, but also investigate the root of this regime, i.e.,
the emotional structure of those people who can make the regime move.50 In other
words, an appropriate governance system is important for constructing social
orders, but more important is an emotional foundation that ﬁts this system. In this
sense, the education aimed at fostering such an emotional foundation should be the
ﬁrst “law” to be accepted by the citizens. The emotional foundation, in the sense of
governance proposed by Montesquieu, is exactly the concept of “mores” that
sociologists like to use. Tocqueville’s analyses of American democracy and the
French revolution were just formed on the basis of whether the regime’s institu-
tional structure and its foundation of mores go together.
Especially in an era of rapid social change, the state system often cannot
determine the emotional structure of the people. Moreover, it might carry out
institutional reforms in disregard of the emotional foundations, resulting in cultural
discomfort of the whole society. Durkheim’s research on anomic suicide points out
that the expansion of capital in 19th-century Europe quickly removed the moral and
emotional foundations of the whole society, and the traditional professional groups
could no longer form social ties and play the protective role.51 However, the
opposition between the regime system and the social mores also poses a challenge
against institutional determinism. Between them, the regime system always
attempts to regulate the social mores through mobilizing the conventional power of
bureaucracy, the arbitrary power of political movements, and even the power of
disciplinary knowledge, so that it can enforce the state will through “reforming the
social customs.” However, social mores is deeply rooted in religions, customs,
family ties and local knowledge, and can more easily arouse the vigor of history,
can sustain in social operation various factors mixed and combined with the tra-
ditions. It is the spirit of the system in the real sense.
In the interaction between regime governance and mores governance, sociolo-
gists often adopt terms like “ﬂexible arrangements,” “informal system,” or
50See Montesquieu (1993, pp. 19–29).
51Durkheim (2001, 2003).

“quasi-formal procedures,” etc., to refer to the deviation from ofﬁcial discourse or
formal institutional arrangements in the practice of the local governments and
communities. But this approach of analysis is prone to neglect the key institutional
factors in the structure of social mores, such as strict religious rituals, sacriﬁcial
ceremonies, township regulations and clan rules, etc. It is also prone to neglect the
so-called “chain of logic” hidden in the culture that dominates the governance
structure.52 In fact, a region’s human geography, ecology, religious belief, family
structure, and even cultural and historical heritages all have their inﬂuences on the
path of regime governance and way of social organization, on the formation and
operation of governance practice. The researchers should not use conceptual tools
within the categories of institutionalism in their analysis, but should start from the
root logic of formation to conduct their studies, and investigate the intermediate
forms (of social mores) in its interaction with the system.
The actual gap between the system and the social mores can lead to delicate
struggles between different levels or dimensions of governance. A great number of
factors in the social mores such as customs, culture and institutions, can be used as
weapons by the weak to resist the invasion of the system. As is observed by James
Scott, the peasants used all kinds of micro-techniques and hidden networks pro-
vided by the local culture to carry out guerrilla warfare and war of attrition in
self-defense.53 Considering the situation of regime movement and knowledge
transformation, it is also possible to use the logic of social mores to transform the
institutional arrangements of the system. For example, some township enterprises
were collectively-owned only in name, but were actually controlled by family
networks. This is a typical example of transformation of the conventional regime
governance on the basis of tacit approval by the social mores. Other good examples
include judicial mediations in accordance with the principles of common sense, and
“ﬂexible arrangements” often mentioned in sociological studies. Besides, social
mores also provides adjustable, moveable and evolving institutional spaces and
coping mechanisms for the grassroots governance of the local governments, which
can expand the local government’s capacity of solving practical problems according
to local conditions, and in the mean time expand the scope of regime governance.54
It can be said that governance mechanisms on different dimensions, such as
regime, savior and mores, have extended the logic of governance in various
directions, and in the process of interaction have formed a pluralistic composite
governance structure. They not only can redeﬁne the relationships of possession
and operation in economic activities, but also can form different standards and
norms that govern these economic relationships in various geographical areas,
cultures and historical traditions. For example, the differences in the modes of
development of township enterprises were rooted not only in different combinations
of various relationships of possession, and in different contractual and agential
52See Duara (1988).
53See Scott (2007).
54See Footnote 40.

relationships in business operation, but also in the differences in governance rela-
tionships on different governance dimensions.
From the above analysis, we can see that possession, operation, and governance
form three important dimensions in our investigation of the nature and structure of
an enterprise. Within each dimension, from a theoretical or historical perspective,
we can further identify different models, which fully demonstrates the complexity
of the enterprise organization itself. What is more complex is that based on the
ecological effects of the socio-political and economic environment, and speciﬁc
historical situations, these models are in turn intertwined with one another on the
three dimensions, forming a wide variety of enterprise types and attributes. In fact,
the different elements composing an enterprise and different ways of their combi-
nation decide the nature of different enterprises, and the complex relationships
between the enterprises and their members. The power structure and power rela-
tionships on the three dimensions within the enterprise organization are also in line
with that. The formation of power structure and power relationships directly
determines the enterprise’s key structural components such as business opportu-
nities, behavior choices and resource allocation, and determines the nature and
operating mechanisms of the relationship between the enterprise and its members.

The Relationship Between the Enterprises
and the Workers Under the Overall
System
When the People’s Republic of China was ﬁrst founded, the new government was
faced with a series of severe problems including high inﬂation, huge ﬁnancial
deﬁcit, sharply rising urban unemployment, rampant speculations, etc. First, it
solved the problem of market disorder through unifying the ﬁnancial work of the
whole country. Then it gradually introduced a system of ﬁxed employment, called
“tong bao tong pei” (centralized allocation of labor), which solved the unem-
ployment crisis and established a centralized system for allocation of labor.
Moreover, with the completion of the socialist transformation of the country’s
handicraft industry, capitalist industry and capitalist commerce, the private own-
ership was basically eliminated; the state ownership and collective ownership
became the dominant sectors in the national economy. In urban-rural relationship,
through implementing “tong gou tong xiao” (state monopoly of the purchase and
marketing of grain) in the rural areas, the food rationing system in the cities, and the
household registration system, the new government managed to stop the free
movement of population and labor, and established a dualist system of urban-rural
separation. Correspondingly, in industrial policies, heavy industries (not agricul-
ture) and means of production (not consumer goods) were given priority; industrial
proﬁts were derived through the use of price scissors between industrial and agri-
cultural products. On this foundation, a planned economic system with state
monopoly and redistribution of resources at its core was gradually established. In
the mean time, through incessant class struggle, the national ideology was highly
uniﬁed. In the rural people’s communes and urban danwei (work unit) society, a
new way of life was formed under the new socialist rule of virtue. With the three
essential elements (i.e., rural-urban dualist separation, the planned economic sys-
tem, and ideologization of everyday life) working together, an “overall society” was
formed, where there was no free ﬂow of resources or space for free activities. Such

an “overall society” lasted all through the thirty years between the founding of the
PRC and the start of reform and opening.1 During these thirty years, the relationship
between the enterprises and the workers was greatly inﬂuenced by this overall
system.

could only be alleviated through constant movements and adjustments, which resulted
in the cycles of internal crisis of socialism. The mobilizational governance initiated by
the central government continually offset the routinization efforts of the Chinese
Communist Party’s charismatic authority. The relationships between the central and
local governments, between vertical departmental hierarchies (tiao tiao) and hori-
zontal regional arrangements (kuai kuai), between the state and the enterprises,
between the enterprises and the workers, were constantly reshaped in the tug of war
between conventional governance and mobilizational governance.

From 1949 to 1956: The Formation of Highly
Centralized System of Governance
The resolution of the second plenary session of the 7th CPC Central Committee
held in March, 1949, pointed out, “Because China’s economy is still backward,
during a long period after the revolutionary success it is necessary to use the
enthusiasm of urban and rural private capitalism, to facilitate the development of
the national economy.” In September of the same year, the ﬁrst plenary session of
the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) adopted the
“Common Program of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference”
(hereinafter referred to as the “Common Program”), which played the role of an
interim constitution, marking China’s transition from the New Democracy stage to
the socialist stage. The “Common Program” clearly pointed out that the funda-
mental principle of economic construction at that stage was “to develop production
and bring about a prosperous economy through the policies of taking into account
both public and private interests, of beneﬁting both labor and capital, of mutual aid
between the city and countryside, and of circulation of goods between China and
abroad.”

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

When the People’s Republic of China was ﬁrst founded, the state-owned
economy and the cooperative economy had not yet formed a complete industrial
system, which gave political legitimacy and practical necessity to the existence of
the private economy as a complement to the overall economy. However, the private
economy had only a meager existence, being caught in the middle from the
beginning. After that, stability of the social economy was achieved through curbing
inﬂation and unifying ﬁscal and ﬁnancial work. In this process, the private economy
was already undergoing a crisis. The private industry and commerce were con-
strained by various policies in pricing, taxation, and ﬁnance, etc., and were severely
squeezed by state-run shops and cooperatives at both ends of supplies and sales. To
solve this problem, the central government made a quick decision to adjust the
country’s industry and commerce. Mao Zedong delivered a speech at the third
plenary session of the 7th CPC Central Committee, “Fight for a Fundamental Turn
for the Better in the Nation’s Financial and Economic Situation.” He pointed out,
“we should effectively and properly improve the public-private relationship and the
labor-capital relationship, so that under the leadership of the socialist state-run
economy, all elements of the social economy can have division of labor and
cooperation, can ﬁnd their proper place, and contribute to the restoration and
development of the overall social economy.”
However, the constraints of ideology, the continuation of the revolutionary
discourse, and the deepening of class struggle did not allow much time and space
for the development of the private economy. In the early days of the People’s
Republic of China, on its economic front, stability and struggle, adjustment and
movement had always been opposite and complementary to one another. The
struggles against the “three evils” and the “ﬁve evils” were the ﬁrst practices of
mobilizational governance after the founding of the PRC.
In the end of 1951, the struggle against the “three evils” (corruption, waste and
bureaucracy) was set off nationwide. Mao Zedong called for carrying out the
struggle against the “three evils” as a war between the proletariat and the bour-
geoisie. Later, he thought that the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie were even
more dangerous than the war. In the beginning of 1952, at the climax of the struggle
against the “three evils,” the struggle against the “ﬁve evils” (capitalist bribery of
government workers, tax evasion, theft of state property, cheating on government
contracts, and stealing economic information for private industrial and commercial
enterprises) was launched in the big and medium-sized cities all over China.
In the struggle against the “ﬁve evils,” although the intention of the government
was to crack down on the “ﬁve poisonous” behaviors of some unscrupulous cap-
italists, it had a signiﬁcant socio-psychological consequence, i.e., capitalists were
demonized, with private enterprises and private ownership being the incarnation of
“poison.” Although the workers in the private enterprises were also members of the
proletariat, when comparing themselves to the workers in the state-owned and
cooperative enterprises, they had a feeling of political inferiority. Even the children
of some capitalists announced publicly that they wouldn’t inherit their parents’

assets. For these reasons, some scholars regard the struggle against the “ﬁve evils”
as the ﬁrst movement to weaken and negate private ownership in the urban
economy.2
In addition, the struggle against the “ﬁve evils” led to the weakening of man-
agement rights. For example, in Shanghai, before the “ﬁve evils” movement, the
Labor-Capital Consultative Conference was not responsible for the management
and administration of the enterprises. The employers had absolute management
rights including employment, production and sales. After the “ﬁve evils” move-
ment, many grassroots trade unions took on the management duties of the enter-
prises. The employers’ seals and checks were in the hands of the workers. The
management rights of the capitalists were seriously affected. “The employers’
exercise of the three powers was just for show. In fact, every decision needed to be
endorsed by the trade union before it could be implemented.”3 In this situation, the
production enthusiasm of the private enterprises suffered a heavy blow.
After the “ﬁve evils” movement, the adjustment of industry and commerce did
not last long. On June 15, 1953, at the meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee, Mao Zedong proposed the general line and general task of the
transition period. After several revisions, a complete statement of the general line
was formed. It goes, “From the founding of the People’s Republic of China to
the completion of socialist transformation, it is a transition period. And the general
line and general task of the Party in this transition period is to realize the socialist
industrialization of the country step by step in a fairly long period, and to gradually
achieve the state’s socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and
capitalist industry and commerce.” Such a statement was also enshrined in the
subsequent Constitution of the People’s Republic of China. The so-called “yi hua,
san gai” (one industrialization and three transformations), in fact, was to establish a
new ownership of the means of production under the socialist system. At the same
time, “yi hua, san gai” also became one of the basic tasks of the ﬁrst Five-Year
Plan.
The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was a key
component of the three great transformations. In fact, “according to the policy of
utilizing and restraining toward capitalist industry determined by the second plenary
session of the 7th CPC Central Committee, our nation’s socialist transformation of
capitalist industry and commerce have begun ever since the day when we took over
the big cities.”4 After the three great transformations began, the agricultural
cooperative movement was soon set off with great enthusiasm in the countryside.
A system of state monopoly over purchase and marketing “based on the unit of the
commune” was ﬁnally established. The implementation of the state monopoly
system facilitated the transformation of the private commerce in the circulation
sector, and in turn boosted the transformation of the private industry. In the

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

beginning of 1956, industry-wide public-private partnerships were set up in the
capitalist industry and commerce. Shortly after, the socialist transformation of the
handicraft industry also accelerated. “By the end of June in 1956, organized
handicraftsmen accounted for 90% of the total.”5
The three great transformations determined by the general line for the transition
period and the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan produced great inﬂuence
over our country’s economic and social development. From the perspective of the
enterprises and the workers, such inﬂuence was most clearly seen in the three
aspects of possession, operation and governance.
Firstly, as to the possession of the means of production, the whole people was
designated as the subject of ownership. In the beginning, the “Common Program”
and the Constitution established the state system and government system on the
foundation of public ownership of the means of production; they also recognized
the working class in the public-owned sector as the subject (zhu ti) of ownership
relations. However, this political change in ownership relations also led to many
contradictions in production practices. In particular, the enterprise organizations,
which stood between the state and the individual workers, were at the core of the
contradictions. First, multiple ownership forms co-existed in the early years of the
PRC, among which, the state-owned economy wasn’t the dominant form, the vast
majority still being capitalist enterprises and individual business operators. As a
result, the logic of the whole people and the proletariat as the subject of ownership
could not be applied to all areas of industrial organization. Second, from a micro
perspective, when it comes to any speciﬁc capitalist enterprise, it was still
capital-oriented ownership that played the dominant role. The workers to a certain
degree were still objects of exploitation. Moreover, in a time when everything
needed to be rebuilt from scratch, the practical state policies also provided a certain
degree of survival space for capitalist enterprises. Therefore huge contradictions
were formed between the overall whole people ownership and the capitalist own-
ership which was still in existence. When these contradictions between ideology
and reality were reﬂected in production activities, many speciﬁc problems arose,
such as the dispute between “collective system and one factory system.” The
objective of socialist transformation was to solve these problems from ownership
relations. For example, in the process of public-private cooperation, some methods
such as joint ventures, mergers, the big leading the small, the more advanced
leading
the
less
advanced,
etc.,
actually
broke
the
boundaries
of
ownership. Concrete forms of the public-private cooperation such as “cai bing gai
he” (remove, merger, convert, combine) were all re-arrangements of the ownership
relations.
Secondly, from the perspective of business operation, the planned economic
system, established on the basis of ownership relations, required the state to possess
hyper-rationality.6 It required the state government, as the primary agent, to possess
5See Bo (1991a, p. 449).
6See Heller et al. (1983).
3.1
Thirty Years of Incessant Movement and Adjustment
43

hyper-rationality and super executive capacity, so that it could arrange and control
all operational activities of the enterprises in the planned economy, and establish an
exchange process in the sense of planning (planned market). From 1949 to 1956,
the role of market regulation declined rapidly, a highly centralized economic system
gradually formed. In the early years of the People’s Republic of China, the exis-
tence of capitalist enterprises objectively required that a free market still have its
survival space. The lack of a complete state-owned industrial system also required
that the capitalist enterprises continue to exist and be a necessary complement to the
national economy. However, due to multiple causes, including the guideline of
giving priority to the development of heavy industries established by the First
Five-Year Plan, the need of technological catching-up and economies of scale, the
imbalance of industrial and regional development, the measure of increasing
accumulation for solving fund shortages, etc., a highly centralized management
system was formed. While developing to its extreme, this management system
continually squeezed the functional space of the free market, until it disappeared
altogether. At the time of the formation of this system, the enterprise organization,
as a production unit, had completely lost its autonomy in making management
choices.
Finally, in the sense of knowledge sociology, the proletariat’s subject status (zhu
ti di wei) was established in the country’s politics, economy, and society. Ideology
increasingly became a means of governance. As early as in “Analysis of the Classes
in Chinese Society,” Mao Zedong had pointed out, “The Chinese proletariat,
although it is small in number, is the representative of China’s new productive
forces, is the most progressive class in modern China, is the leader of the Chinese
revolution.” However, the Chinese revolution took the road of using the rural areas
to encircle the cities. To a great extent, this revolution was also a peasant revolution.
The importance of the proletariat, especially the working class in the cities, was not
fully shown. But after the PRC was founded, the logic of rural-centered social
revolution was replaced by the logic of urban-centered social construction. The
revolutionaries who entered the cities were confronted with the task of building a
socialist industrial country from scratch. In this background, giving the leadership
to the proletariat was not only signiﬁcant to the communist ideology, but also met
the real needs of city administration and economic construction. After the founding
of the PRC, the “Common Program,” as the interim Constitution, stipulated that
“The People’s Republic of China is a New Democratic, or a People’s Democratic
state. It carries out the people’s democratic dictatorship led by the working class,
based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and uniting all democratic classes
and all nationalities in China.” In 1954, the ﬁrst Constitution of the PRC explicitly
stated, “The People’s Republic of China is a people’s democratic state led by the
working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.” This means that
for the ﬁrst time in the history of China, the working class, as the leading class,
became the most important social stratum shouldering the political system. Its
fundamental position in the state system and government system was established.
However, how the working class could exercise its power as the leading class
was in itself a problem. Its exercise of state sovereignty was always realized
44

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

through a certain system of representation. The working class’s national leadership
was realized through its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party. And in turn, the
Party’s leadership of the country was realized through vertical level-by-level rep-
resentations of Party committees and local governments. As a result, the relation-
ship between the workers and the state was characterized by complex interaction
among the three sides of the workers, the Party, and the bureaucratic organizations.
In terms of the working class itself, “led by the working class” meant that it was no
longer just an identity group in a particular social structure, but a class group
representing the legitimacy of governance. For the workers in different trades and
industries, in different enterprises, and the workers of different types of work,
different ages, different skills in the same enterprise, although differences still
existed objectively among them, their differences were completely ﬂattened in the
ideological sense. They all belonged to the concept of a uniﬁed, liberated working
class. There was, however, always contradiction between the concept of labor as a
role in speciﬁc social organization and the concept of labor as a class in the
“overall” sense. For example, the workers of state-owned enterprises and
collectively-owned enterprises were two different identity groups, which had great
differences in income, welfare, labor insurance, social status, and self-identiﬁcation.
Moreover, in the early years of the PRC, because the private economy still occupied
a large proportion of national economy, although the workers were emancipated
and became masters in ideology, in concrete working life, they still needed to enter
a particular relationship of employment and accept the exploitation of the capital-
ists. In contrast with the workers in the state-run enterprises, they perceived
themselves as being inferior in status. How to reconcile the contradiction between
the differences in status identiﬁcation and the overall unity of class became an
important issue in labor governance in the early days of the PRC. The opposition
between the ideological commitments and the reality was clearly seen.
On this basis, solving the problem through socialist transformation, not only had
signiﬁcance in possession (ownership) and operation (management), but also had
signiﬁcance in state governance. On the one hand, the state promulgated a large
number of laws and regulations to protect the workers. On the other hand, it directly
interfered with the labor-capital relationship through the democratic reform, and
political movements like the “three evils” movement and the “ﬁve evils” move-
ment. The internal management relationships determined originally by capital
operation was now closely linked with state governance. Through these move-
ments, the feudal gang masters and guilds in industry and commerce were abol-
ished. But at the same time the traditional organizational ties among the workers
were also removed. Although due to practical needs, capital still had a legitimate
position, a complete system of labor protection was established. For example,
agencies like the Labor Ministry, local labor bureaus, the general labor union and
local labor unions, labor consultative conferences, etc., were set up. Laws and
regulations were promulgated, such as the Trade Union Law, Measures for
Resolving Labor Disputes, Labor Insurance Regulations, and Measures for Making
3.1
Thirty Years of Incessant Movement and Adjustment
45

Collective Contracts, etc. Due to the increasing need of the ideology,7 capital
operation gradually lost its legitimacy, and political commitment increasingly went
beyond the conventional governance forms of bureaucracy and laws. The growing
emphasis on ownership put heavier constraints on the business operation of the
enterprises, to the extent that capital and market lost their survival space in the
socialist system. What’s more, the socialist “new rule of virtue,” which was based
on the discourse of class, and had Party member’s models, moral models, pro-
duction heroes and labor models as its speciﬁc contents, was also established in the
enterprises. The political incentives replaced the production incentives for the
workers, which further diminished the signiﬁcance of capital.
More importantly, the socialist transformations accomplished through mass
mobilization, on the one hand, had eliminated the possibility of rationalizing
enterprise management through capital and market. On the other hand, they made it
difﬁcult to solve the problems of formalism in administration and over-investment
in production under the planned economic system. Moreover, many hidden irra-
tional factors in the system were prone to be triggered off. It can even be said that
the highly centralized planned economic system had deviated from the road of
rationalization from the very beginning. The hidden dangers had begun to show up
even during the socialist transformations. From 1955 onwards, in China’s economic
construction, there had been a trend of rash advance, more speciﬁcally, of “raising
the quantitative indicators and ignoring the comprehensive balance.” Although the
8th National Congress of the CPC in 1956 and the ﬁrst formulation of the Second
Five-Year
Plan
stopped
this
trend
temporarily,
with
the
movements
of
“Rectiﬁcation,” “Anti-Rightist” and “Criticism against the Aggressive,” the econ-
omy sank deeper and deeper into a state of irrationality.
7Article 3 of the 1949 Common Program has the following statement. “The People’s Republic of
China must abolish all the prerogatives of imperialist countries in China. It must conﬁscate
bureaucratic capital and put it into the possession of the people’s state. It must systematically
transform the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership system into a system of peasant land own-
ership; it must protect the public property of the state and of the cooperatives and must protect the
economic interests and private property of workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie and the
national bourgeoisie.” As can be seen from this article, the legitimacy of “private property” itself
had not yet been abolished, but the source of this legitimacy had been based on the state’s
judgment on the political inclination of the property holder, that is, “the basis for the division and
protection of property rights had not been the legitimacy of ownership in the legal sense, but class
character in politics.” However, the 1954 Constitution clearly states that, “The People’s Republic
of China, by relying on the organs of state and the social forces, and through socialist industri-
alization and socialist transformation, ensures the gradual abolition of systems of exploitation and
the building of a socialist society.” This means that by that time the state had “artiﬁcially set
private property against public property on the basis of ideology, and had de facto announced that
private property would soon become illegal, and thus should be eliminated.” See Gan (2010).

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

3.1.2
From 1957 to 1965: Constant Shifts Between
Centralization and De-centralization
The highly centralized management system required the country to possess
hyper-rationality. But the governments at various levels were the real subjects of
agency, and the operation of the redistribution system can only be performed
through level-by-level delegation. The excessively centralized economic manage-
ment system was not conducive to the initiatives of the local governments and
enterprises. Rather, it led to the tendency of “tiao tiao zhuan zheng” (direct and
exclusive control of enterprises by the ministry concerned).8 Reversely, unrestricted
decentralization would cause a state of disorder with unchecked power expansion at
different levels. This is the predicament of so-called “yi tong jiu si, yi fang jiu luan”
(lifeless by centralization, chaos by de-centralization).
The central government noticed this inherent contradiction from very early on.
In “On the ten major relationships” published in April, 1956, Mao Zedong pointed
out, “The relationship between the central and the local authorities constitutes
8In December 1952, the Central People’s Government set up the State Planning Commission to
strengthen the central government’ capacity in developing and implementing the system of
planned management, and to emphasize the authority of the central planning agency. In 1953, the
central government revoked the economic management function of the governments of great
administrative regions (the military and administrative commissions). The chief cadres were
reassigned to central government positions, and their original economic management power was
largely taken back by the central government. In 1954, the central government abolished the
organization system of great administrative regions. Thus, the main relationship between the
central and the local governments changed from that between the central and the great adminis-
trative regions to that between the central and the provinces, which strengthened the central
government’s ability to control the local governments. In the mean time, nine working departments
were added in the Government Administration Council, six of which were economic management
departments, namely the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the Second Ministry of
Machine-Building Industry, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Construction Engineering,
the Ministry of Food, and the Central Ministry of Trade (which was divided into the Ministry of
Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade). Only two years after, by the end of 1956, the State
Council had set up 17 additional working departments, the majority of which were economic
management departments. These were the State Economic Commission, the State Technological
Commission, the Third Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the Ministry of Electrical
Machinery Manufacturing, the Ministry of Forest Industry, the Ministry of Product Purchasing, the
Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, the General
Administration of Materials and Supplies, the General Administration of Urban Construction, the
Ministry of Heavy Industries (divided into the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of
Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry), the Ministry Of Fuel
Industries (divided into the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the
Ministry of Power Industry). In the mean time, the provincial governments also set up their
corresponding departments in accordance with the central ministries under the State Council; local
governments below the provincial level generally did the same. By that time, from the perspective
of economic management agencies, a highly centralized administrative system had been formed,
which relied mainly on vertical departmental control, and set up management departments
according to types of industry and products.

another contradiction. To resolve this contradiction, our attention should now be
focused on how to enlarge the powers of the local authorities to some extent, give
them greater independence and let them do more, all on the premise that the uniﬁed
leadership of the central authorities is to be strengthened. This will be advantageous
to our task of building a powerful socialist country. Our territory is so vast, our
population is so large and the conditions are so complex that it is far better to have
the initiative come from both the central and the local authorities than from one
source alone. We must not follow the example of the Soviet Union in concentrating
everything in the hands of the central authorities, shackling the local authorities and
denying them the right to independent action.”
The “Resolution of the State Council on Improving the State Administrative
System (Draft)” adopted in August 1956 mainly dealt with the issue of central-
ization and decentralization. The draft deﬁned the principle of dividing the central
and local administrative powers, and formulated concrete measures in 12 aspects,
including plan management, ﬁnancial management, industrial management, etc. In
industrial management, four main categories were divided concerning the propor-
tion of central authorities and local authorities, in accordance with the nature of the
industry. It was also decided that “In the future, if the local authorities had the
conditions and capacities to run new enterprises, then they should be allowed to
build and run them, but this should be done with the exception of particularly
important enterprises, and under the uniﬁed planning of the central authorities.” It
was also suggested that the scope of functions and powers be properly expanded for
factories and mines at all levels. However, the policy makers at that time didn’t
realize that although expansion of enterprise management rights could help vitalize
the economy, it also had negative effects. Due to excessive centralization of the
administrative system and the special mode of carder management (each level is
held responsible for its superior), which resulted in a kind of downward “ampliﬁ-
cation effect” in a planned system characterized by hierarchical management and
level-by-level commitment, expansion of enterprise management rights was prone
to cause uncontrollable economic frenzies. “If the superiors have a hobby, the
subordinates will love it more intensely.” “Big planning” was incapable of curbing
“little freedom.” In 1958, with the start of “the Great Leap Forward” in national
economy, China’s industry entered a phase of substantial decentralization.
In fact, since the “Rectiﬁcation Movement” and “Anti-Rightist Struggle” in
1957, the political wind had undergone major changes. The 3rd plenary session of
the Eighth CPC Central Committee, which was held in September and October of
the same year, revised the conclusion on the main contradictions drawn by the 8th
National Congress of the CPC. It postulated that “the general contradiction is the
contradiction between socialism and capitalism, that is, between the working class
and the bourgeoisie.” Then, in 1958, the second session of the 8th National
Congress of the CPC formulated the general line of “go all out, aim high, and build
socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.” From then on,
the national economy was set to a “high-speed gear.” The general line, the sub-
sequent “Great Leap Forward,” and the “People’s Commune Movement,” were the
“Three Red Banners” at that time.
48

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

The “Great Leap Forward” in industry was epitomized by the mass steel cam-
paign. The National Economic Planning Report by the 5th session of the First
People’s Congress in February 1958 proposed a target of 6.248 million tons for
steel production in 1958, a 17% increase from the actual output of 5.35 million tons
in 1957. This was called “the ﬁrst account book” for steel production in 1958. But
soon after, an added-up sum of local targets of steel production reached 7.11 million
tons, which was called “the second account book” for steel production in 1958.
When the 48th enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau was convened in May, this
target became 8 to 8.5 million tons, which was the “third account book.” Finally,
the meeting in Beidaihe set the 1958 steel production target at 10.7 million tons
(doubling the total steel output in 1957). In order to complete this impossible task, a
mass movement of “backyard furnaces” was set off nationwide. In the last three
months of 1958, the quality iron produced by modernized blast furnaces could only
meet a quarter of the target, while most of the pig iron needed to be produced with
“backyard furnaces.” In September, 600,000 “backyard furnaces” were set up, and
50 million people participated in the steel campaign nationwide.9 The products of
such
a
high-input,
low-efﬁciency
process
of
steelmaking
were
generally
sub-standard in quality. In the ﬁrst quarter of 1959, the pass rate of pig iron
products was less than 50%. After that people began to make “low-temperature
steel,” which was a taboo in steel production.
The mass steel campaign’s inﬂuence on the national economy was not limited to
this. First, it opened a precedent for high accumulation rate, jumping from 24.2%
during the First Five-Year Plan to 33.9% of 1958. Second, the disproportion
between industry and agriculture was aggravated; in particular, the proportion of
heavy industries in the national economy was inﬂated. Compared with 1957, the
output value of heavy industries increased by 78.8%, while agriculture only
increased by 2.4%. In addition, the People’s Commune Movement in the villages
adopted the “big-pot” system for distributing food, which led to severe food
shortages over wide areas. Third, it caused confusion in enterprise management.
Party leadership replaced the system of overall responsibility by factory director,
leading to the situation of power monopoly by the Party committee. Some enter-
prises even practiced “no management” or “management by the workers them-
selves,” which resulted in deﬁciency of planning in industrial production. Fourth, it
led to rapid growth in urban population within a short time, bringing huge pressure
on city management. The central authorities became aware of the problems of the
“Great Leap Forward” in the end of 1958, and began cooling down and “com-
pressing the air.” However, the “Anti-Rightist Movement,” set off by the Lushan
meeting in 1959, aggravated the predicament again. In 1960, the national economy
was already in an extremely difﬁcult state.
The “Great Leap Forward” in the industrial ﬁeld can be seen as a result of
ideologization in the production sphere and extreme decentralization under the
planning system. Firstly, it was a business activity participated by the whole people
9See Editors of the Contemporary China Series (1985, p. 56).
3.1
Thirty Years of Incessant Movement and Adjustment
49

and launched by mobilizational governance. It was a political production movement
launched with a complete batch of political mobilizations, and promoted with
political slogans like “bravely launch satellites,” and “surpass the UK and US.” The
“Great Leap Forward,” which was dominated by a mass movement, was largely
detached from the overall layout of the planned economy. It was not a
market-oriented reform either. Instead, it was an extreme manifestation of the
command economy, which ran counter to the true sense of “management,” lacking
rationality in planning, investment, organization and execution. Secondly, as an
attempt at decentralization, the “Great Leap Forward” was unsuccessful. Just like
“limiting the power of the monarch to produce a de facto republic,” such a measure
in fact led to a certain degree of anarchy. As an approach of mobilizational gov-
ernance, the “Great Leap Forward” tried to change the industrial layout “dominated
by vertical control,” which was caused by the highly centralized system. However,
the sudden change from “vertical departmental control” to “horizontal regional
control” not only upset the original collaboration relationships, but also failed to
establish a new mode of production organization and management, resulting in
disorder, confusion, and loss of control.
Besides, from the perspective of within the enterprise, the “Great Leap Forward”
broke the socialist production pattern which used the enterprise as the basic unit,
and formed a type of cross-enterprise, cross-unit production organization form. In
this condition, the operation of the enterprise was completely void of organizational
protection. In the sense of possession, the “Great Leap Forward” weakened the
level-by-level participial-agent (delegation) mechanism in conventional gover-
nance, and canceled the administrative restrictions at all levels and among all
organizations, thus eliminating the logic of enterprise operation in the economic
system. The adjustment that followed soon after was just a return, to a certain
degree, to enterprise organization in the aspects of possession and operation.
In the end of 1960, the central government put forward the “eight-character
guideline” of “tiao zheng, gong gu, chong shi, ti gao” (adjustment, restructuring,
consolidation, and improvement). After the “Seven Thousand Cadres Conference”
and the “West Building Conference” in 1962, the “eight-character guideline” aimed
at “sufﬁcient cuts” began to be truly implemented. First, in the industrial ﬁeld, most
of the targets of heavy industry production in 1962 were reduced by 5–20% from
the original plan, with the target of steel production decreased to 6 million tons.
Second, measures were taken to discriminatorily downsize, merge, and shut down a
number of factories, and to keep a number of other factories which had low con-
sumption, low costs, good quality, and high labor productivity. In addition, a large
number of peasant workers who entered the cities during the “Great Leap Forward”
were sent back to the countryside. In 1960, the urban population of the country
reached 1300 million, an increase of 31.24 million from 1957. In 1961, the urban
population decreased by 10 million, of which 8.73 million were workers. In 1962, it
was planned to further reduce the urban population by 10 million, of which 8.5
million were workers.

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

From the beginning of adjustment to the “Cultural Revolution,” two things were
noteworthy in the industrial ﬁeld, the ﬁrst being the promulgation of the Seventy
Articles on Industry in 1961, the second being the experiments on running trusts.
The Seventy Articles on Industry was China’s ﬁrst document of a constitutional
nature on enterprise management. Firstly, it stipulated that “ﬁve sets” and “ﬁve
guarantees”10 must be implemented between the state and the enterprises, to
strengthen the control over the enterprises through planning. Secondly, the Party
organization’s intervention in the enterprises’ production and management was
restricted. It was stipulated that “in the state-run industrial enterprises, the admin-
istrative system of overall responsibility by factory director should be implemented
under the leadership of the Party committee. This is our country’s fundamental
system of enterprise management.” According to the provisions, a unitary pro-
duction administrative command system headed by the factory director should be
established. A technical management responsibility system headed by the engineers
should be established. In addition, the workers’ congress system was included in
speciﬁc provisions. Furthermore, the enterprises were required to implement overall
economic accounting.
In fact, many contents of the Seventy Articles on Industry were reiteration and
afﬁrmation of the policies before the “Great Leap Forward.” In view of the con-
tinual “politicization” in the administrative management of industrial enterprises
during the “Great Leap Forward,” the Seventy Articles attempted to pull the
enterprises’ production back to the track of business operation in its true sense, and
to rectify production management inside the enterprises by using the opportunity of
industrial layout adjustment in which the central authorities took back power from
the local authorities. However, the Seventy Articles on Industry itself also had
many inherent contradictions. Firstly, although it stipulated that state-owned
industrial enterprises were “independent units of production and management,” the
enterprises were still a “unit” within the planned economic system, and actually had
no independent management rights. The enterprises’ production was not sensitive to
the social needs. The enterprises didn’t carry out real economic accounting. The
“ﬁve sets” and “ﬁve guarantees” had actually determined the scope of business and
mode of production for the enterprises. Therefore, the independent status of the
enterprise existed only in name. Secondly, although it attempted to limit political
intervention in business administration, the “leadership of the Party committee” was
still a tall hat worn by the enterprises. The system of overall responsibility by
factory director could not be thoroughly implemented; the production and man-
agement of the enterprises still had to give way to political missions. As a result of
these inherent contradictions, the Seventy Articles on Industry could not produce
10The so-called “ﬁve sets” refers to: set line of production and scale of production; set personnel
and organ; set the norm quota of consumption and supply sources of raw materials, fuel, power
and tools; set ﬁxed assets and working capital. The “ﬁve guarantees” means that the enterprises
guarantee the variety, quantity and quality of products to the state; guarantee not to exceed the total
wages; guarantee the implementation of the cost plan, and strive to reduce costs; guarantee the
turning over of proﬁts; guarantee the operating life of major equipment.

the effect of adjusting enterprise management. With the “Four Puriﬁcations
Movement” and the Movement of “The Whole Nation Learns from the People’s
Liberation Army,” enterprise management inevitably headed for the path of
“politicization” again.
The last experiment on reform in the industrial ﬁeld during the adjustment phase
after the “Great Leap Forward” was “experimenting on trusts.” The decentralization
in the “Great Leap Forward” led to chaos in industrial production. The intertwining
between “the vertical control” and “the horizontal control” resulted in excessive
decentralization of power and multi-head management of the enterprises. Although
after the year of 1960 the central government began to take back power, the
contradiction between centralization and decentralization, between concentration
and dispersion, remained unsettled all along. How to straighten out the relationship
between “the vertical” and “the horizontal,” so as to promote collaboration among
the enterprises, became an urgent question. On the one hand, the trusts made efforts
to unify the allocation of ﬁnance, materials and labor in the industry. On the other
hand, they tried to promote the close connection of production, supply and sales,
and promote the close integration of specialization and collaborative production. In
1963, the China Tobacco Company was established to exercise centralized control
over the purchase of raw materials and the product sales of the cigarette industry
nationwide. In 1964, the Central Committee decided to try another 11 trusts. At the
same time, some provinces and municipalities also tried a number of local trusts,
such as the General Glass Factory and General Plastic Factory in Beijing, the Light
Industry Machinery Company in Shanghai, and the Machine Tool Company in
Tianjin.
However, in the course of experimentation on trusts, some problems emerged,
all being the result of two contradictions between different types of initiatives. The
ﬁrst contradiction was between national or cross-regional trusts and local authori-
ties. Some provinces and municipalities with powerful resources hoped to organize
collaborative production on their own. The national and cross-regional trusts
affected the local governments’ ﬁnancial revenue, which heavily relied on industrial
proﬁts and taxes. Therefore, the local authorities were often unwilling to let go local
enterprises. Secondly, viewed from within the enterprises, the running of trusts
actually further encroached on their independent status. A single enterprise could
not carry out economic accounting. The integration of production, supply and sales,
the uniﬁcation of personnel, ﬁnance and materials further compressed the enter-
prises’ power in independent arrangement of production and management.
It can be seen that the problems in running trusts are still the problems of
difﬁculty in coordination between the central government and local governments,
between the government and the enterprises, between “tiao tiao” (the vertical
departmental hierarchies) and “kuai kuai” (the horizontal regional arrangements).
These problems can even be regarded as a microcosm of this whole period. In order
to break the inﬂuence of the Soviet model on the road to industrialization, the
industrial policies of this period were constantly changing, which most clearly
manifested itself in the continual swing between centralization and decentralization
within the planning system. Due to such constant changes and continual swing,
52

incessant changes also took place in the urban and rural labor population structure,
the enterprises’ internal management system and labor relations.
3.1.3
From 1966 to 1978: Complete Turmoil
and a New Dawn
The hyper-rational state under a highly centralized planning system was not
omnipotent, particularly for a country of vast territories and great regional differ-
ences like China. “A series of difﬁculties commonly seen in organizational design,
such as information asymmetry, incentive scheme, performance evaluation, regu-
latory costs, etc.,” were often ampliﬁed and intensiﬁed due to “organizational
complexity and enormous scale,” which led to the failure of conventional gover-
nance. Mobilizational governance was just aimed at remedying such shortages of
conventional governance.11 Starting from the adjustment phase after the “Great
Leap Forward,” the Central Committee made some efforts in regularizing the
national economy. But before long, Mao Zedong realized that such constant
adjustments were contradictory to the socialist system in his understanding, and
decided that they belonged to the “revisionist line.” Next, we saw the “Cultural
Revolution” take place. The reality may be more complex than that is viewed only
from the economic and organizational perspectives, but that does not prevent us
from looking at the mechanisms and logic of the operation of the state machine in
this light. Thus, we can regard the “Cultural Revolution” as an anti-system mass
political movement set off by a charismatic authority.
For such a mobilizational governance mechanism to take effect, certain orga-
nizational conditions must exist ﬁrst. First, a charismatic authority in the form of
personal worship is a necessary precondition, because it provided the movement
with a foundation of legitimacy. Second, the “dual authorities of the party and the
administration co-existed in various organizations.” Such a structure provided the
necessary institutional arrangements, and was realized in the enterprise organization
as the system of overall responsibility by factory director under the leadership of the
Party committee. Finally, the Communist Party’s “effective organization, strict
discipline, and ability to guide the overall situation” also provided the movement
with driving force.
About the economic situation during these 10 years, the domestic academia has
a summary of “three downs and two ups.” From 1967 to 1969, the national
economy was affected by the “full-scale civil war,” and underwent rapid deterio-
ration. This was a period of regression. From 1969 to 1973, stimulated by the need
of war preparedness and supported by rapid and large investment, the national
economy was restored and made certain progress. In 1974, under the severe impact
of the “Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius” campaign, the national economy again

plunged into a difﬁcult situation. In 1975, Deng Xiaoping presided over a rectiﬁ-
cation phase, and the Fourth Five-Year Plan was accomplished. In 1976, under the
impacts of the “strike against the right deviationist wind of reversing verdicts,” the
successive deaths of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, and the Tangshan
Earthquake, the economy suffered a serious decline.12 According to the economic
statistics of this period, the industrial and agricultural output value still had an
annual increase of 7.1% during these 10 years. The economic index of 1976
increased by 99% from that of 1966. The conclusion that the national economy
gained certain progress during the “Cultural Revolution” appears to be more con-
sistent with the “statistical facts.” However,if we look at the social consequences
caused by the “Cultural Revolution,” in aspects like enterprise production, city
management, population ﬂow, etc., we will draw the opposite conclusion.
After the “Cultural Revolution” began, the clerks in various State Council
departments were unable to carry out normal work. In 1967 and 1968, not a single
national plan was issued for two consecutive years. The Seventy Articles on
Industry was heavily criticized as “the black outline aimed at collapsing socialism
and restoring capitalism.” The efforts to construct enterprise management within the
planned economic system were ﬁnally proved a failure. In the industrial ﬁeld, the
contradiction between revolution and production was particularly prominent. The
so-called “stress revolution, promote production” was actually dominated by a set
of highly abstract political notions and ideology. The mobilizational, anti-system
governance constantly set off large-scale mass movements, wherein the productive
working class gave way to the revolutionary masses, and all existing bureaucratic
structures of conventional governance became the objects of revolution. On the
basis of extreme ideologization of ownership relations, corrupt bureaucracy even
usurped the power of the working class, and formed a revolutionary mechanism of
“joint movements at the central and the grassroots levels.” Under the high pressure
of “ownership relations presiding over all else,” all the production and marketing
operations of the enterprises had to give way to the revolutionary logic. The
enterprise organizations generally fell into a state of inaction, even collapse.
Shanghai was taken as an example, “since the second half of 1966, many enter-
prises’normalproductionwas affected.Theirproduction tasks decreasedsharply.Asa
result, a large number of temporary workers were dismissed.”13 However, with the
increasing legitimacy of the action of “zao fan” (rebel), a workers’ group composed of
temporary workers, contracted workers, and outsourced workers, who originally had
very little say in the enterprises, also organized a “rebel group”,14 and demanded to
have the same wages, beneﬁts, and employment security with the regular workers.
They were even received at a meeting by a central leader. In addition, the “rebel”
workers established “the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebellion General
Command” to meet their political demands. As the normal factory order was

destroyed, more and more workers left their jobs to join the “pai xi dou zheng”
(factional struggle) and “da chuan lian” (big link-up). When the initial fever had
passed, large numbers of worker entered a loose state of neither engaging in revolution
nor in production. Such a situation was not relieved until the second half of 1968.
The “Cultural Revolution” produced far more inﬂuence on the society than just
mentioned. A movement with far-reaching impact during this period was the “Up to
the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement.” In fact, educated urban
youth had begun going up to the mountains and down to the villages ever since the
1950s. However, before the “Cultural Revolution,” such movements were mainly to
alleviate the employment pressure in the cities and towns, and to support the
Cooperative Movement in the rural areas. Most of the youth who returned to the
countryside were originally born in the countryside. Educated urban youth were
rarely seen to settle in the villages. After the “Cultural Revolution,” the movement
was mainly due to two aspects of practical consideration. On the one hand, because
the schools had stopped enrolment, large numbers of students could not enter a
higher school. By 1968, the number of such graduates reached 10 million. They
were “the school leavers of 1966–1968.” On the other hand, the stalled industrial
and mining enterprises simply could not provide so many employment opportu-
nities. A large number of unemployed populations added to the pressure of urban
management. In addition to these practical considerations, Mao Zedong’s political
worry about revisionism and his thought of “education revolution,” or the
re-education of the intellectuals, were the biggest driving forces behind the
expansion of the “Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement.”
According to the statistics, from 1968 to 1980, a multitude of 16.6 million educated
urban youth joined this movement.15 It changed the destiny of a generation of
young people. The “scars” left by this movement became the “collective memories”
of a whole generation. These memories have a lasting inﬂuence on social
construction.
The academia has produced little research on this movement which had
far-reaching and long-lasting impact. In fact, this movement provides us with a
perspective for understanding the form of China’s state governance in that period.
Firstly, class struggle and the forever revolutionary ideology, as a means of
knowledge management, had gone to the extreme and become the counterforce.
The society was permeated with fanaticism of personal worship and hostility of “to
rebel is justiﬁed.” Secondly, the social structure of urban-rural dualist separation
had become ﬁxed; the educated urban youth felt as if they had been thrown into a
completely strange world when they joined the movement. Finally, not only that the
means of conventional governance were insufﬁcient in resolving the social crisis,
but also mobilizational governance further led to a situation of complete turmoil,
which could only be remedied by another movement at the cost of a whole gen-
eration’s youth. If for any system of governance, a cost analysis should be pro-
duced, such a cost was simply too much. Casting aside the nostalgia of “youth

without regret,” if there was any positive factor in this movement, it perhaps lied in
an unintended effect. This forced “knowledge going into the villages” helped
improve the knowledge level of the countryside, which promoted the rise of
commune industries some years later, and paved the way for the development of
township and village enterprises in the reform period.
During the phases of adjustment and restoration in the middle and late period of
the “Cultural Revolution,” two decisions had impact on the future industrial layout,
namely, “san xian jian she” (the Third-Front Construction) and the development of
local “wu xiao gong ye” (ﬁve small industries).
The “Third-Front Construction” was a major strategic deployment aimed at
improving the industrial layout, strengthening national defense, and enhancing war
preparedness. It was carried out with the implementation of the Third and Fourth
Five-Year Plans. The so-called ﬁrst front, second front, and third front are actually
division of geographical areas. The ﬁrst front refers to the coastal areas; the second
front refers to the middle areas, the third front refers to the rear areas. There are,
however, two types of rear areas. The Southwest and the Northwest belong to the
big third front. The interiors of the middle and coastal provinces belong to the small
third front. Since the founding of the PRC, China’s industrial deployments were
concentrated in the coastal provinces, while the industrial foundations of the middle
and western areas were very weak. The “Third-Front Construction” was just aimed
at resolving this state of imbalance. Adhering to the principle of being scattered,
close to the mountains, and hidden, the “Third-Front Construction” movement
carried out planned relocation of important factories, key schools, and scientiﬁc
research institutions from the ﬁrst front to the third front. The “ﬁve small industries”
was a practice of transferring management power from the central to the local
authorities during the “Cultural Revolution.” In the early 1970s, the state again
began to transfer management power over ﬁnance, materials, and planning to the
local authorities, and at the same time, simpliﬁed the institutions of taxation, credit,
and labor employment, in order to provide institutional guarantees for the devel-
opment of local industries. In February 1970, the National Planning Conference
was held in Beijing, giving emphasis to the following. All local governments
should vigorously develop the “ﬁve small industries.” “All provinces, municipali-
ties, and autonomous regions should set up their own small coal mines, small steel
factories, small non-ferrous metal mines, small fertilizer plants, small power plants,
small cement plants and small machinery factories, and form a local industrial
system that serves the development of agriculture.” While the “ﬁve small indus-
tries” ﬂourished everywhere, the district, community, and street industrial enter-
prises also gained rapid development, creating space for various types of collective
ownership enterprises.16 The development of collective enterprises in the cities
alleviated the large-scale employment shortages in the “Cultural Revolution,” and
also provided large amounts of employment opportunities for the educated urban
youth who were to return from the countryside. The development of collective

enterprises in the countryside, on the other hand, paved the way for the “unexpected
rise” of township and village enterprises after the reform and opening-up.
The rural collective ownership was formed in the period of the People’s
Commune. An important manifestation of this was the ownership arrangement of
“the production team as the basis, and three grades of possession.” The means of
production were owned respectively by the production team, the production brigade
and the people’s commune. Such a collective ownership was different from the
common ownership in the sense of community. Research shows that the “cadre
group” was the de facto controller of the collective property. Therefore, the real
management rights of the commune and brigade enterprises in the time of the
People’s Commune, and the township and village enterprises that succeeded them
were actually in the hands of township and village cadres. Such a fuzzy ownership
was exactly the basis for the rapid development of township and village enter-
prises.17 The development of township and village enterprises introduced industrial
labor relations into the countryside for the ﬁrst time. The countryside in the tra-
ditional sense also began to engage in enterprise operation and management. The
township and village enterprises and their predecessors can be regarded as an
unintended consequence under the overall system. This “unexpected rise of a new
force” ripped a hole in the overall system, and gave people a glimpse of the new
dawn of reform.
3.2
The Danwei System: Enterprise Organization Under
the Overall System
Polanyi, an economic historian, distinguished three forms of economic integration,
reciprocity, redistribution and market. In Polanyi’s writing, the term of “redistri-
bution system” is mainly used to describe early empires. The legitimacy of the
redistributive power comes from traditional authorities. The purpose of redistri-
bution is to maintain the reproduction of the system.18 However, in the socialist
economic system, the power of the central planners to redistribute the surplus is
derived from “purposive rationality,” that is, they claim to be able to most effec-
tively use the surplus and ensure growth.19 Under the system of redistribution, it is
the redistributor’s “purposive knowledge” that gives legitimacy to redistribution,
that is, they claim to know better than common people about what is more in line
with the society’s long-term interests.20 This type of rationality is utterly different
from the rationality of market capitalism, and socialism is therefore also referred to
as “a hyper-rational economic system.” From the point of view of political

economy, the socialist planned economic system that China gradually formed and
ﬁnalized after 1949 is in fact a type of redistribution system.
In the socialist redistribution system, actors at different levels and different
positions, from the central to the local, in the bureaucratic structure constitute
different redistributors. The redistributors manage to expand their redistributive
power by maximizing the surplus amount under their control. Therefore, the
socialist redistribution economy has an inherent tendency to reduce consumption
and expand investment. Under the redistribution system, the state-owned enter-
prises need not consider the issue of proﬁts. As long as they can obtain the various
resources needed for production, they can continue their operation. This is the
so-called “soft budget constraint” from Kornai. Soft budget constraint often results
in overproduction. In fact, according to Iván Szelényi and others, the decisive factor
in softening the budgets of state-owned enterprises is the state’s extraction of
surplus in the redistribution system. “The state, as the owner, has a tendency to
intervene in the process of capital accumulation. If the central planning authorities
are willing to stop intervening in the process of accumulation, and to stop extracting
proﬁts from more proﬁtable enterprises, then people can solve the problem of soft
budget constraint within the socialist economic system.”21 In a nutshell, Szelényi’s
important discovery is that in the socialist redistribution economy, there exist four
inherent tendencies: to minimize consumption and expand investment; to minimize
individual consumption and expand collective consumption; transfer of surplus
from more proﬁtable enterprises to less proﬁtable enterprises; to maximize pro-
duction of industrial goods and reduce production of consumer goods.22
Szelényi made a further revelation that, in its actual performance, the socialist
redistribution economy produced a complex and diffuse power system. Behaviors
like “network,” “patronage,” and corruption, etc., played a key role in maintaining
the smooth operation of the system. He argued, “the best starting point for a
description of the socialist redistribution economy is the intense competition and
bargaining between redistributors at various levels and positions in redistributive
bureaucracies.”23
Szelényi proposed that in an analysis of a socio-economical system, the fol-
lowing three aspects should be considered: form of ownership, mechanism of
economic integration, and the unique form of rationality that dominates this system.
A socialist economic system has the following characteristics. First, its goal is to
eliminate individual private property and institutionalize a certain form of collective
ownership (usually state ownership). Second, it exercises centralized control of
capital and labor, that is, to a great extent; the economy is integrated by redis-
tributive intervention of the central state apparatus, while the market mechanism is
marginalized. Third, the central planners have the authority of “purposive
rationality,” that is, the legitimacy of their redistributive power comes from their

claim that they are more capable than the producers and the market to determine
how the surplus is distributed. “Therefore, in the socialist economic system, most of
the means of production are collectively owned. The role of the market is limited to
certain marginal areas. Central planning and redistribution have profound impact on
the logic of economic reproduction. In such a logic, substantive rationality occupies
the dominant position.”24
In China, this socialist redistribution system is embodied in the organizational
form of the “danwei system” (dan wei zhi, also translated as the “work unit sys-
tem”). “Danwei is a special organization formed on the basis of China’s socialist
political system and planned economic system. It is an organizational form for the
state to carry out social control, resource allocation, and social integration. It
shoulders multiple functions including political control, specialization and division
of labor, life guarantee, etc. Its typical forms are Party and government agencies
(administrative units), state-owned management and service agencies (institutions),
and state-owned enterprises in the urban society.”25 The danwei system began to
emerge in the early years of the People’s Republic of China, and began to take
shape in the mid-1950s. Then, it changed constantly for more than ten years under
China’s institutional changes, until it was stabilized and continued during the
“Cultural Revolution.”
3.2.1
The Danwei System as a Form of Governance
The danwei system is a relatively mature research topic in indigenous sociological
studies. The existing studies already provide us with many useful insights in terms
of governance. The scholars have put forward many explanations about this special
organizational form from various points of view, which have enriched our under-
standing about enterprise organization under the overall system.
Lu Feng’s study traces the political and historical roots of the danwei system. He
believes that the danwei system originated from a special system in the revolu-
tionary base. A supply system based on individual work positions and qualiﬁcation
assessment gradually took shape during the “large-scale production campaign” in
the 1940s, and gave birth to the early form of the public-owned enterprise. After the
founding of the new regime, the organizational principles and distribution pattern of
the supply system were inherited in the process of building the socialist system. As
the uniﬁcation of ﬁnance and political movements like the “three evils” and “ﬁve
evils” went under way, the Party authority was rapidly established in the urban
society. The inﬂuence of the new political authority structure on the labor system
included the formation of labor unions, implementation of democratic management,
the relief of unemployed workers, the labor dispute arbitration system, the
24ibid.
25Li et al. (2009).
3.2

establishment of labor insurance system, etc. The establishment of the danwei
system and the formation of the overall system were almost synchronous, so as to
achieve the dual political targets of completing the socialist transformation of the
means of production and the country’s industrialization. The danwei system formed
in this way has the following characteristics. First of all, all danweis have “inte-
grated functions,” that is, “each danwei serves multiple functions at the same time,
including political, social, professional division of labor, etc.” The second is “the
non-contractual relationship between the main factors of production.” That is to say
danwei is not a business entity formed on the basis of contractual relations. The last
one is “the non-ﬂuidity of resources,” which means the mobilization of the
resources is not controlled by market forces but by redistributive powers.26
While Lu Feng traces the origin of the danwei system to the Communist Party’s
base in Northern Shaanxi, Bian Linan’s studies reveal another historical clue to its
origin. In his view, the emergence of danwei was actually a system change created
by the Nationalist Government in response to the overall crisis caused by the
Japanese invasion during the Anti-Japanese War. Bian Linan believes that this
continual overall crisis led to the establishment and restructuring of a central
planning bureaucracy, which naturally resulted in the rapid expansion of
state-owned heavy industries. At that time, many places in the Southwest, which
received a large number of war immigrants, lacked modern facilities and good
market support. As a result, many enterprises began to provide various types of
social welfare on their own, ranging from kindergartens to funerals. Each enterprise
looked like a self-sufﬁcient kingdom. Thus a new state-owned enterprise system
was formed. It demonstrated three characteristics: “bureaucratic governance struc-
ture, management and incentive mechanisms with distinctive characteristics, and
provision of social services and welfare by the enterprises.”27
Lu Feng and Bian Linan’s studies revealed the historical roots of the danwei
system as a mode of conventional governance. Emergency measures in production
in the revolutionary era or Anti-Japanese War led to the formation of danwei and
the danwei system as a modern bureaucratic organizational form. The later devel-
opment and continual change of the danwei system has had to face all kinds of
issues left over from history caused by such “path dependence” all along.28 Besides,
the danwei system was also a product of the new regime’s efforts to deal with and
adapt to extremely serious social, economic and political situations and challenges
within and without the country in accordance with the needs of the “national
conditions.”29 The two mechanisms of path dependence and resource constraints
together promoted the formation of the danwei system.30

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

Certainly, it is not enough to account for the origin of the danwei system from a
genetic point of view. The question why it became a common enterprise organi-
zation form under the socialist system also needs to be answered. One reason is that
it had a certain degree of conformity with the administrative system. In terms of
administrative levels, a danwei is always subordinate to a certain “superior danwei,”
and follows the leadership of that “superior danwei.”31 Titles like “bureau-level
enterprise” and “ministry-level enterprise,” etc., are reﬂections of such a
pyramid-like hierarchical administrative structure. In practice, the boundaries
between the government departments and danwei as enterprise organizations are
very fuzzy, resulting in the phenomena of “zheng qi bu fen” (no separation of the
government and the enterprises) and “dang zheng bu fen” (no separation of
the Party work and the government work). Li Hanlin believes that in its concrete
performance, the danwei played a dual role. On the one hand, the danwei took on
various social functions. The phenomenon that the enterprises took on all kinds of
social service responsibilities was called “qi ye ban she hui” (an enterprise runs a
small society). Under this logic, it was taken for granted that the danwei should
provide its members with all sorts of welfare, which resulted in the members’
dependence on their danwei. On the other hand, the state adopted a vertical man-
agement mode to control the production, supply, marketing, personnel, ﬁnance, and
materials of the enterprises, under which the danwei could only “obey, accept and
perform the superior danwei’s actions and commands.” The bargaining with the
superior danwei due to “the economy of shortage” further strengthened such “de-
pendency” and “compliance” in the process of resource exchange. Li Hanlin thinks
that this system of dependency not only came from imitating the Soviet socialist
road and social system, but also had its roots in the traditional Chinese family
culture. The danwei members’ dependence on the danwei was just a “mirror
reﬂection of family members’ full dependence on the family in the traditional
Chinese family organization.”32 In addition, the “gui kou” management (centralized
management by specialized departments) of the urban collective organizations
further expanded the administrative scope of the danwei system, and further blurred
the boundary of the “danwei.”33
From this we see that in the danwei system, a level-by-level delegation (zhu ji
dai li) structure had formed between the superior danwei, the subordinate danwei
and the danwei members. However, this “delegation” was not the “principal-agent”
relationship in the sense of economics, because in the planned economic system, the
business characteristics of the enterprise had been remarkably weakened. To a
greater extent, this “delegation” referred to administrative afﬁliation, political
dominance, and economic dependence. The phenomenon of “the enterprise running
the society” was not so much an economic activity as a form of governance. On the
one hand, “over-development” of the danwei system became a tendency. On the

other hand, “the social services in the communities continued to shrink.” The
danwei gave its members a social status, provided them with social support,
security and welfare. The replacement of the community by the danwei was an
important characteristic of social governance under the overall system.34
Research on the danwei system cannot be separated from research on the
“danwei,” the “cells” of the system. The study of the danwei, a “political entity of
production”,35 can expand our understanding of the macro economic and political
conditions of the danwei system, connecting the work site with the wider scope of
political economic systems and their changes. The researches using the danwei as
the basic unit of analysis pay close attention to “individuals with rational
decision-making capacity,” and care about “the micro operational process of the
actual society.” Research from this point of view began with Andrew Walder’s
Communist Neo-Traditionalism: Work and Authority in Chinese Industry. Li Meng
and other scholars’ studies have accurately reviewed its signiﬁcance as a paradigm
shift.36
In Walder’s view, the danwei under “communist neo-traditionalism” formed a
kind of subculture based on personal relationships, and constructed a highly
institutionalized “network of patron-client relations” through “organized depen-
dence” and “principled particularism.”37 However, Li Meng also points out that
there are some serious problems in Walder’s research. For example, he only
emphasizes the patron-client relationship between the “leader” and the “enthusi-
asts,” but fails to give consideration to the “expression of interests” of the ordinary
people. In addition, Walder always regards the “leadership” as a “body of uniﬁed
ideas and actions,” but neglects the differences among its members and the resulting
“factions.”
It is just through analysis of the “redistribution system of rule-of-virtue” under
the socialist state system that Li Meng’s study reveals the signiﬁcance of “factions”

process, market competition, labor reproduction and state intervention. According to this, he made
a typological classiﬁcation of factory regimes that had existed in history. He not only made
distinctions between market despotism, the hegemonic regime, and the hegemonic despotic
regime, but also extended the concept of factory regime to the analysis of national socialism and
colonialism, and set forth the ideal models of ‘bureaucratic despotic regime,’ ‘bureaucratic
hegemonic regime’ and ‘colonial despotic regime,’ etc. Different production regimes shaped
different working class interests and abilities. In Production Politics, Burawoy used the differences
in production regimes to explain why the October Revolution took place in Russia, while the
British working class had always stuck to reformism.” (See Wen and Zhou 2007).
36See Li et al. (1996).
37See Walder (1996). From the perspective of political sociology and organizational sociology,
patronage can be deﬁned as “a relationship of exchange between a pair of roles. It is a special case
of instrumental friendship between two parties. The one with higher socioeconomic status (patron)
uses their inﬂuence and resources to provide protection and beneﬁts to the one with lower
socioeconomic status (client). In return, the client gives the patron general support and help,
including personal service.” (Scott 1972, p. 92).

in the power structure of the danwei. Because of the lack of clear standards for
moral evaluation, a feature of this redistribution system was the “shortage of rules.”
However, it was precisely because of this shortage of institutions that “leaders” or
“ofﬁcials” were given “fairly large disposal rights or free space” as judges. The
awareness and utilization of such a space “behind the scenes” were just the source
of power in the danwei. Li Meng et al. claims, “The power base (in the danwei) was
actually a vertical network of relationships. From the hub, which was a certain
ofﬁcial at a certain level within the danwei, this network extended both upward and
downward in a dispersed manner. On the same level, competitions tended to divide
ofﬁcials into several separate units. Thus several relationship networks co-existed,
each extending upward and downward, each being parallel to and separate from the
others. We call this a ‘factional structure.’” The factional structure was not only a
basic power structure, but also a basic interest structure, even a basic action
structure within the danwei. The factional structure played a key role in information
communication and power exchange. Li Meng keenly notices that it was the
relationship networks, not “class groups,” that constituted the main ways and
channels for individuals to pursue personal interests in the Chinese society. Interest
groups within the danwei were “vertical factional groups corresponding to the
factional structure.” It was the factional relationships with the higher-level leaders
that determined the way in which people strove for their interests.38 In the processes
of decision-making and execution within the danwei, the real functioning forces
should be sought from the factional structure. The factional structure was the basic
form of danwei operation, hidden under the surface of a bureaucratic structure. As
“cracks” in the enormous hyper-rational system, it provided the foundation for the
existence of “free space” in the danwei system. This “free space” was ﬁlled with all
kinds of rent-seeking behaviors aimed at grabbing resources, as well as expedient
measures caught between efﬁciency and legitimacy, and struggles for redistributive
power. The logic of this space was not “dai li” (delegation) in the bureaucratic
system, but the ubiquitous “power” and the relationship networks that it
generated.39
3.2.2
The “Social Dynamics” of the Danwei System
The existing research has broadened our understanding of the danwei system from
many aspects. First of all, the research on the danwei system has opened up research
on the Chinese communist society from the organizational point of view. It not only
38“There are complex game processes between the factions within the danwei, between the acti-
vists and the marginal members within the factions, and among the non-factional members
wavering between various factions. Each member would draw up a factional chart in their mind
according to their own understanding of the situation, and decide on their own action strategy
according to this chart.” See Li et al. (1996).

gets rid of the “totalitarianism” tendency with a strong ideological color, but also
differs from the “convergence” theory of pluralism.40 It analyzes the inherent
operational logic of the redistribution system under the economy of shortage, and
reveals the historical, political and administrative roots of the danwei system, that
is, the emergence of the danwei system is the result of interweaving inﬂuences from
various complex factors. Secondly, it draws attention to the consistency of the
danwei system in the new regime, that is, the enterprise under the danwei system is
both an economic and a political organization; it is the extension of the overall
social operation logic into the economic organization. Moreover, because of the
ubiquity of “the enterprise running the society,” the danwei becomes, to a greater
extent, the carrier of “social integration,” and becomes the most basic unit in the
urban governance system. Finally, research on the danwei system also reveals
the existence of a variety of informal institutions in the danwei, and points out that
the patronage network and factional structure are the real basis for the danwei
members’ action. Therefore, in practice, the socialist system is far from a
tightly-knit whole with hyper-rationality, but a free governance space ﬁlled with
various concrete actions.
However, the existing research also has many shortcomings. A breakthrough in
the research on the danwei system needs our efforts in the following aspects.
Firstly, the danwei system is not immutable. The existing research basically
treats the danwei system as a static ideal type, but fails to distinguish its different
characteristics in different historical stages.
In fact, during the 30 years after the founding of the PRC, because of the
changes in social conditions, the evolution of urban-rural relationships, the varia-
tions in worker mobility, and the impacts of political movements, the danwei
system underwent changes in its concrete form in different practical situations and
different stages. A breakthrough of existing researches needs a perspective of
“long-term dynamics.”41
In the existing research, only Lu Feng divided the formation and evolution
process of the danwei system into stages. He thinks, “the danwei system ﬁrst took
shape by the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, and became more politicized
through the decentralization practice of the “Great Leap Forward.” Finally, it
achieved a “mature form” in the “Cultural Revolution.”42 In retrospection, while
examining the “dynamics” of the danwei system in this historical period, we need to
pay close attention to at least several aspects. First of all, urban and rural demo-
graphic changes continually shaped the boundaries of the danwei. The workers’
recruitments following the direction of the state policies caused massive population
ﬂow, which posed constant challenges to the enterprises, as business organizations,
in maintaining the balance of elements. The effect of soft budget constraints on
corporate governance was shown just in the constant changes in personnel. Such an
40ibid.

64

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

effect was the most obvious during the “Great Leap Forward,” and the “Up to the
Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement.” Secondly, the social
movements continually impacted on the daily practice of the danwei system. The
constant alternations between decentralization and centralization, as well as the
repeated pendulum swings between conventional governance and mobilizational
governance, caused the danwei to become an important place for economic pro-
duction, social life and class struggle under the overall system. These movements
certainly left huge impacts on danwei, the danwei system, and the people in danwei.
At present, there is still a lack of research on the social process and mentality
history of such a movement mechanism. Finally, close interaction existed between
the danwei system and the overall social structure. The centralized management of
collective enterprises by specialized departments and “the enterprise running the
society” were important ways of social integration through the danwei system.
Moreover, the danwei system also produced extensive inﬂuences on the grassroots
society. In that historical period, the danwei system was an important mechanism
through which people established their social identiﬁcation. Danwei provided the
most basic social identities for its members.
Secondly, the static treatment of the danwei system leads to inattention to the
alternation between conventional governance and mobilizational governance.
Mass mobilization is an important factor in activating the danwei system. The
institutional design of the danwei system determines that it is at the same time an
economic organization, a social organization and a political organization. It con-
tains a profound contradiction between efﬁciency and legitimacy, of which the
concrete manifestation is the contradiction between production and revolution.
The conventional governance of the danwei system cannot completely overcome
the tension between production and revolution. As a result, it needs constant
adjustments through movements. Paying attention only to revolution, only to
mobilizing the masses is prone to hinder production. For this, the “Cultural
Revolution” is the most extreme example. But simply talking about production
without engaging in mass mobilization can easily lead to bureaucratism in the
danwei, resulting in the loss of legitimacy in the sense of charismatic authority.
Therefore, enterprises under the danwei system need to continually engage in the
creation of a form that can combine these two elements.
For example, the labor emulation campaign was a concrete form of combining
revolution with production. Labor emulation was an unconventional form of pro-
duction mobilization (e.g., the Patriotic Production Emulation Campaign during the
War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea). However, it was also a regularized
and institutionalized form of production under the danwei system. Labor emulation
and other activities for selection of the advanced, not only created some obvious
“achievements in production,” but also cultivated a number of labor models and
enthusiasts; so as to continually inject vitality into the socialist production system
which lacked incentives. Of course, such unconventional production activities also
had a price. When it was combined with labor quota and target management, it
easily led to the problem of emphasizing quantity but neglecting quality, thereby
aggravating the phenomenon of “overproduction.” It can be said, “while mass

65

mobilization played a key role in boosting economic growth in the era of China’s
planned economy, it also served to destroy the planning core and output effec-
tiveness of the old system.”43
Thirdly, while discussing the enterprise organization under the danwei system,
the existing research overlooked the debate on the “agential” aspect of the
enterprise.
For example, in the early years of the People’s Republic of China, concerning
the management of state-owned enterprises, a debate went on for a period of time
between the proponents of the “one-man management” and the “Party committee
system.” The “one-man system” originated from the Soviet Union’s industrial
management model, i.e., “system of responsibility by factory director.” Mao
Zedong remarked, “take the ‘one-man management’ as an example, the central
committee once endorsed some local authorities’ practice of it, and thought that it
deserved a trial. At that time we had no experience on this issue, therefore, could
not draw the conclusion that ‘one-man management’ was not good. But recently,
we formed our judgment that one-man management is not good, a system com-
bining collective leadership and personal responsibility is better.”44 In September
1956, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China convened and
re-established “the leadership system based on the combination of collective
leadership with the Party committee as the core and individual responsibility,” that
is, the system of overall responsibility by factory director under the collective
leadership of the Party committee.
The Party’s leadership over daily work is a concrete manifestation of the rou-
tinization of charisma. Therefore, the debate over the enterprise’s “agent” not only
concerns the political ecosystem of the enterprise, but also has signiﬁcance in the
sense of organization. Under the system of overall responsibility by factory director
under the collective leadership of the Party committee, the administrative power
had complete domination over the allocation of production resources and the
combination of production factors, and the enterprise management had very distinct
features of “administrativization.” For example, the investment right of the enter-
prise was heavily limited.45 “In the traditional system, the directors of common
state-owned factories only had independent decision-making power over the pur-
chase of low-value consumable goods with a unit price ranging from 200 to 500
yuan. Even the managers of big enterprises, like the Capital Steel, Anshan Steel and
Wuhan Steel, could only independently approve the purchase of products with a
unit price under 800 yuan.”46 The so-called “no separation of government and
enterprises” refers just to this situation wherein the administration took on every-
thing under the danwei system.

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

The debate between the “one-man management” and the “Party committee
system” and its resulting policies had continual inﬂuence over the form of corporate
governance in this period. The slogan of “be both red and expert” was the concrete
embodiment of the logic of legitimacy and the logic of efﬁciency in the
“rule-of-virtue redistribution system.” Unrestricted administrative intervention
almost wiped out the adjustment effect of the market mechanism in the planned
economy. In fact, the essence of the state-owned enterprise reform in the later times
was to try to change this power structure of “politics in command.”
Fourthly, the existing research lacks a distinction of the different subject forms
(zhu ti xing tai) under the danwei system. It has not done enough research on the
internal leadership system of the danwei, nor has it made a clear distinction of the
workers groups, nor has it carried out analysis on the structural meaning of such
functional institutions as the Party committee, trade union, and workers’ congress.
In reality, the danwei is a compound organization, in which various functional
institutions and action subjects move about along intersecting paths. Therefore, the
danwei system needs to engage in constant movements under the logic of state
governance. This “dynamism” of the danwei system was often embodied in the
form of the “mass line” (qun zhong lu xian). The “mass line” was a basic principle
established by the Communist Party in the revolutionary period. In 1943, Mao
Zedong wrote in “Some questions concerning the methods of leadership”, a reso-
lution draft for the Central Committee of CPC, “In all practical work of our Party,
the correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses… gathered
from the masses and persisted among the masses, so as to form the correct lead-
ership, this is the basic method of leadership.” In all the movements after the
founding of the new regime, the mass line still remained the most basic political and
organizational principle. “The Charter of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company” was
a typical example of the concrete implementation of the mass line in the industrial
ﬁeld.
“The Charter of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company” proposed “two partici-
pations, one reform, and co-working of three.” That is, “the cadres should partic-
ipate in the production work, the workers should participate in enterprise
management; the unreasonable regulations of the enterprise should be reformed; the
leading cadres, technical personnel and workers should work together in the
enterprise’s technical reforms.” The key point is that it broke the hierarchical
structure of the danwei organization, and narrowed the hierarchical distance
between the cadres and the workers. The criticisms of “expertise in command” and
bureaucratism by “the Charter of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company” are, in
essence, a reaction towards conventional governance. Different actors’ ways of
participation and expression of interests in similar movements are exactly the
questions that need to be further explored.
Fifthly, the existing research still needs to solve the problem of transition from
research on “danwei” to research on “the danwei system.”47
47See Footnote 36.
3.2

67

The establishment of the danwei system not only depends on the internal
mechanism of the danwei, but also dependents on the danwei’s continual interac-
tion with its external environment. The existing research largely focuses on the
micro mechanism of the internal operation of the danwei, but lacks in-depth dis-
cussion on “the danwei system” as a part of the overall system. Research on the
danwei cannot take the place of research on the danwei system. The relationship
between the danwei system and the danwei is equal to that between the entirety and
the individual, the former being larger than the latter. Many issues concerned with
the danwei system cannot be dealt with by research on the danwei.
In sum, the discoveries already made in the research on the danwei system and
the several aspects still waiting for breakthroughs all indicate from a certain per-
spective that the enterprise, as a type of organization under the danwei system,48
has great complexities in terms of possession, operation and governance.
Firstly, in terms of possession, the state-owned enterprise is owned by the whole
people, and the state is only the owners’ agent. That is the true meaning of
“state-owned.” However, the state cannot implement direct agency in practice, and
therefore needs to develop a bureaucracy of level-by-level delegation (zhu ji dai li),
which leads to the tendency of administrativization that we ﬁnd in enterprises under
the overall system. However, there are frequent tensions between the “state,” which
embodies the highest will, and the bureaucracy, which is responsible for concrete
operation. It’s necessary to constantly use the method of mobilizational governance
to combat the decentralization tendency of the bureaucracy.49
In fact, the so-called “owned by the whole people” is not equal to ownership of
the enterprise by its internal staff, because according to such wording, the owner of
any enterprise should be the “collective body of workers” working for all the
enterprises. Therefore, workers in any region, or any enterprise, have the same
rights in the sense of possession. As a result, the uniﬁed national wage standard is
applicable to all state-owned enterprise workers. The decision-making power
concerning the wage system and the hierarchical system does not rest with the
enterprise itself. And the workers’ wages are not differentiated by the business
performance of the enterprises.50 However, beside the wages, the workers have
other beneﬁts, which are closely related to their danwei. Such beneﬁts differ with
different industries. And different danweis have actually become different “welfare
48As to the question which organizations on earth should be included in the category of “danwei”
under the danwei system, the scholars already had much discussion. The danwei in this book refers
speciﬁcally to the enterprise organization under the danwei system.
49Zhou (2012).
50This is also reﬂected in that the workers’ congress, which is formed through level-by-level
representation, cannot determine all the speciﬁc enterprise affairs, because the rights of the workers
inside the enterprise are not the same as the workers’ rights deﬁned by the whole people ownership
system. The abstract rights of the whole people ownership system cannot interfere in the speciﬁc
affairs of the enterprises. Therefore, as just one aspect of the corporate governance structure, the
workers’ congress in fact does not have decision-making power in all enterprise affairs.
68

communities.”51 The workers’ income is in fact made up of these two parts. The
ﬁrst is the standard wage embodying the ownership of the whole people; the second
is the welfare system which varies in different industries. In addition to these, there
is also a more “hidden” social contract, wherein the state provides guarantee for the
worker’s birth, old age, illness and death.
Secondly, from the perspective of operation, the relations of possession deter-
mine that the enterprise is not entitled to autonomous operation rights, but only has
agential management rights. Such agential management means strict implementa-
tion of the decisions from the superior about the production quota, market quota,
transaction price, scope of sales, basic wages and welfare for the workers in the
sense of the planned economy. Therefore, the enterprise in its ideal state is a
product of hyper-rationality. Each enterprise is only a terminal inside this enormous
system. The business operation of an enterprise requires independent management
goals, a management model suitable for its trade and scale, funds for expanding
reproduction, labor employment, labor incentives, etc. These are all tainted with the
color of “commands from the superior” in the system. This determines that the
enterprises in the danwei system are the objects of allocation and regulation in an
enormous economic system, rather than being the subject of autonomous business
management.
But in fact, on the one hand, it is impossible for hyper-rationality to plan and
control all speciﬁc activities of the enterprise. “It is the anarchy of planning that
takes the place of the anarchy of market.”52 On the other hand, within the enter-
prise, “operations” in another sense have never stopped, that is, the enterprise
members carry out rent-seeking activities taking advantage of the power space
generated by the level-by-level delegation. Patronage and factional structure
become the targets of such operations, and their beneﬁts far exceed the nominal
income (for example, housing allotment under the danwei system).
Finally, in terms of governance, because in actual social management many
social problems faced by the enterprise workers, their families and their commu-
nities were handed over to the enterprise, the phenomenon of “the enterprise run-
ning the society” inevitably occurred in the enterprise’s operation. The complexity
of “the enterprise running the society” rests with the fact that it was related to all
social conditions surrounding the enterprise, including community condition,
population make-up, etc. Under the danwei system, social governance was based on
the socialist “new rule-of-virtue,” that is, to break the old social ties, to mold the
socialist new persons, and to cultivate comradeship. Moreover, such practice of
reshaping the social mores from the moral level was not limited to within the
51Lu (1989).
52See Footnote 20.

enterprise organization, but was wide-spread over the whole society. From cities to
villages, people everywhere were building a new way of life.53
3.3
The Unity Mechanism Within the Danwei
Under the danwei system, the state-owned enterprise is not just a production
organization; the mechanism of efﬁciency cannot fully explain its functions. On the
contrary, it often needs to undertake some “anti-efﬁciency” activities resembling
rituals in order to obtain legitimacy within the whole system. The lack of efﬁciency
of the state-owned enterprises is an indisputable fact. On the one hand, the budget
soft constraints easily lead to the irrational distribution of means of production or
even waste. On the other hand, the employees are also prone to become lazy, to
“loaf on the job” and to “hitch free rides,” etc. However, these deﬁciencies did not
lead to the collapse of the danwei system. In addition to using the strategy of
reducing consumption and increasing accumulation to maintain the whole eco-
nomic system, the operation of the danwei system also needs the support of the
social foundation. The danwei system is a gigantic machine designed by
hyper-rationality. If it is the state power from the top that provides it with driving
force, then it is the social relationships in production that continually gives it
lubrication.
The existing research has focused more on the “negative functions” of the social
relationships inside the danwei. Walder’s Communist Neo-Traditionalism opened
up the research of analyzing the power structure under the danwei system from the
perspective of social relationships. He did not put much emphasis on the macro
planning system in his analysis, but regarded it as a concrete institutional back-
ground. His theoretical analysis focused on the structure of relationships and
behavioral patterns inside the danwei organization, so as to discover the stable
53According to Ying Xing, “in contemporary China, the new rule-of-virtue is the basic mechanism
of China to achieve political governance and the re-production of political relations through using
party ethics after 1949. This type of ethical politics with close combination of morality and power,
which had been aimed at shaping the pure communist new person and the new world of supreme
goodness, had developed a unique set of truth discourse in the long-term practice of military
struggle and political movement, that is, on the basis of blending the Marxist class struggle theory
with the traditional Chinese theory of self-cultivation. It had also gradually developed a complete
set of unique power technology, so that the new rule-of-virtue could permeate all corners of the
society, and produce deep impact on every individual. However, the biggest paradox of the new
rule-of-virtue is that this unprecedented ‘self-eliminating’ moral force also annihilated the possi-
bility of the ethical practice of the individuals’ free pursuit of perfection and goodness, which led
to wide-spread hypocrisy. Corruption was an unintended consequence of the political system of
new rule-of-virtue, however, it did not constitute a challenge to the power of rule-of-virtue, but on
the contrary was absorbed by the rule-of-virtue political system as a ‘behind the scenes’ mecha-
nism, and further strengthened the legitimacy and necessity of using political movement to
mobilize people’s moral passion.” See Ying (2001).

mechanisms dominating organizational behaviors.54 But he only focused on the
patronage relationship between the leaders and the enthusiasts within the danwei.
When he looked at the workers inside the enterprise, he only saw how the workers
develop utilitarian personal relationships with the superiors, but failed to attend to
the relationships among the workers, which were more common and basic. As to
common workers, Walder only made the distinction between enthusiasts and
non-enthusiasts. He did not see that the most common and wide-spread relationship
among the workers was actually the apprenticeship. Mentorship as a unity mech-
anism within the enterprise was not dealt with in his study.
The study of Li Meng and others regarded the danwei as an institutionalized
organization under the “rule-of-virtue” redistribution system. Their study not only
dealt with the relationship between the leaders and enthusiasts, but also focused on
the factional relationships within the enterprise. They believed that factional
structure was the real basis for the members’ behaviors. Their study revealed the
importance of informal relationships in the danwei. However, their analysis was
still centered on the “power structure,” they failed to notice the social mores, which
was closer to the grassroots and more concerned with solidarity. Interpersonal
relationships in the danwei not only had the features of power relations, but also had
the features of moral constraints. “Circles,” which were formed on the basis of
geographical closeness, kinship relations and apprenticeship, were the most com-
mon ties of social relationship in the danwei.
Mentorship had widespread practice in the process of industrial development in
both China and the West. The discussions on mentorship in the existing research
mainly include two approaches.
The ﬁrst approach is to explain the historical evolution of mentorship from the
perspective of technological development. According to Western economic history,
mentorship, as a way to teach skills through oral instruction and demonstrative
movements, ﬁrst appeared in family-style handicraft workshops, in the form of “the
son carrying on his father’s trade.” With the expansion of production, the workshop
owners also recruited apprentices to solve the shortage of labor. These apprentices
were at the same time learning skills and helping with the production, which formed
the production mode of labor division and cooperation between the master and the
apprentice.55 Soon after, mentorship became widespread in the handicraft guilds
too. However, with the traditional handicraft industry being gradually replaced by
large-scale mechanized industry, the workers experienced the separation of “con-
cept” and “execution” in concrete production processes. To an increasing degree,
the original complete sets of skills taught by the mentors were reduced to simple,
diffuse, repetitive work.56 The foundation of mentorship collapsed.57

55See Lu et al. (2007).
56See Braverman (1978).
57Peng (2003).
3.3
The Unity Mechanism Within the Danwei
71

The second approach is to explore the evolutionary path of mentorship by
looking at changes in social and economic structures, holding that this is a complex
political and economic process.58 For example, some scholars believe that the
emergence of guilds was the real cause of mentorship, and the collapse of the guild
organizations eventually led to its downfall.59 This interpretation is different from
the approach of technological determinism. It insists that the institutional envi-
ronment is the real cause for the changes in speciﬁc production relations.
Taking a similar approach, we made a brief summary of the changes of men-
torship in China. Mentorship was also a common way of teaching skills in China’s
guild system.60 It was also widely practiced in the national industry in the 1920s
and 1930s. However, the mentorship at that time had already undergone the reform
of “capitalization.” Under the disguise of a new garb, it penetrated into the national
industry through “feudal heads,” such as foremen and contractors, and social
groups, such as “the green gang and the red gang.” On the one hand, it controlled
the labor market. On the other hand, it provided the most basic protection for the
workers.61 After the founding of the PRC, the Communist Party carried out a
step-by-step reform of the labor employment system, abolished the so-called
“system of feudal heads,” and set up a new technical training system. From the
“First Five-Year Plan,” the training of new workers was conducted in the forms of
technical schools, training courses, and apprenticeship training. In the “First
Five-Year Plan” training program of skilled workers, “a total of 119,000 students
received training in the form of technical schools and became skilled workers after
graduation, accounting for 13% of the planned total;” “various enterprises provided
362,000 workers with training courses, accounting for 39% of the total;” “439,000
workers received on-the-job training in the form of apprenticeship, accounting for
48% of the total.”62 We can see that after the socialist transformations, mentorship
was still one of the most important training methods for industrial workers. Of
course, the speciﬁc form of mentorship underwent some changes, and was clearly
different from the forms before the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
Before the founding of the PRC, the relationship between the master and the
apprentice in the mentorship can be characterized as a relationship of dependency in
life, a relationship of secret transmission in the transfer of knowledge and skills, and
a hierarchical relationship in social identity.63 However, after the founding of the
PRC, the situation changed. The life of the apprentice was independent; the
knowledge and skills were open and socialized; in terms of status, the master and
the apprentice were equal members of the working class. After the founding of the
PRC, the central government banned some bad habits of the old apprenticeship,

such as strict prohibition of beatings, abuse, etc.; the workers in training under the
new mentorship had much better living conditions and much higher political status.
However, when the new mentorship was ﬁrst implemented, some problems popped
up, mainly due to the short learning period and excessive wages. “The majority of
mentorship training programs lasted for half a year, one year or three month, only a
small part lasted for a year and a half or two years. After completing a mentorship
program, the apprentice would be paid very handsome wages, generally grade 3, at
least grade 2, and would be promoted to grade 4 or 5 after another two or three
years.”64 Many young workers became very conceited and self-complacent because
of this. In view of this situation, on Feb 6, 1958, the State Council issued the
“Interim Provisions on the Apprentices’ Learning Periods and Subsistence
Allowances in State-owned, Joint State-private, Cooperative, Self-employed
Enterprises and Institutions,” which stipulated that the period of learning should
be three years, and could be shortened to two years for relatively simple types of
work. It also set out speciﬁc provisions about the apprentices’ medical care, labor
protection, wage grades, etc. Thereafter, mentorship training became increasingly
normalized.
However, it is not enough to simply regard the mentorship in the state-owned
enterprises as a form of skills transmission. The mentorship was also an ethical
relationship. To a certain extent, this type of ethical relationship served to promote
the transmission of skills; conversely, the weakening or even cut-off of the original
mentor-mentee relationship would be detrimental to the transmission of skills.65 This
is closely related to the unique characteristics of mentorship. In the mentorship, the
mentor and the mentee had face-to-face interaction, working together in the same
workshop, in the common production space and work process. The young workers’
learning of production knowledge was practical. The training of some concrete skills
could only be carried out through oral instruction and demonstrative movements,
even “secret understanding of heart messages.” If separated from the workshop or
the speciﬁc production processes the transmission of such practical knowledge and
skills could not be achieved. Therefore, the mentorship was a one-on-one,
face-to-face, hand-with-hand type of teaching, that is, the so-called “chuan bang
dai” (teach, help, and lead) model of worker training.66
Moreover, “the mentor teaching the mentee by personal example as well as oral
instruction” was not limited to the production process; “teach, help, and lead”
meant that the mentor and the mentee had joint responsibility not only in production
but also in life. The essence of the mentorship was not the relationship between the
leader and the staff under bureaucracy; operating between the mentor and the
mentee was not a normalized logic of the formal organization, but a logic of
“particularism” that followed common sense and good judgment in speciﬁc issues.
In this sense, the mentorship under the danwei system still inherited some

traditional elements, that is, it possessed the characteristics of paternalistic man-
agement. The relationship between the mentor and the mentees resembled that
between the patriarch and the children, which rendered the mentorship a “family”
color. Beside, once the mentoring relationship between the mentor and the mentee
was established, it was not subject to change; the two persons’ life courses became
closely connected thereafter. The communication between the mentor and the
mentee went far beyond the workshop. For example, the mentee’s love and mar-
riage were also part of the mentor’s family obligation. As a result, their reputations
in the danwei and other danwei members’ evaluations of them did not just concern
their individual selves but both of them. The intimate group consisting of the
mentor and the mentees generated a deeper relationship in addition to the profes-
sional relationship deﬁned by bureaucracy. Such a deeper relationship became an
important force in corporate governance. The inter-generational links between the
mentor and the mentees, and the next-generation mentees, were a key factor in the
factional structure and patronage network in the danwei system.
Therefore, we can ﬁnd in the workshop the existence of a “dual mechanism.”
One was the formal system required by the bureaucracy; the other was the general
social relationships of solidarity formed by the mentorship. Besides, the formal
system of bureaucracy was “embedded” in these social relationships of solidarity.
The long-term, stable, even life-long relationship between the mentor and the
mentee was an important complement to the mobility of speciﬁc positions in the
bureaucracy. Moreover, because under the danwei system, the possibility of an
individual ﬂowing out of the danwei was very small, the mentor-mentee relation-
ship thus became more stable. In sum, the bureaucracy and the mentorship had
mutual inﬂuence and mutual constraints. Such a “dual mechanism” was a key
feature of corporate governance in the danwei system.
Sociological studies attach great importance to the analysis of structures and
mechanisms, which requires us, when examining the enterprise under the danwei
system, to not only look at the power relations and interest relations, but also pay
attention to the universal moral and emotional ties, and to the terminal carriers of
concrete solidarity mechanisms. Organization, in a certain sense, is not only a
bunch of institutional rules, technical rules and transaction rules, but also, and even
more so, the relationships between people and the resulting norms and activities.
Under the mentorship, the working team as the terminal of organization, the
front-line workers as the terminal of labor, and concrete production behaviors as the
terminal of production were combined together. If we look at the work process
under the danwei system from a bureaucratic, rational point of view, we should see
normalized, institutionalized relationships. But in reality, we ﬁnd that there also
existed informal, contextualized mechanisms on a more micro level, their concrete
embodiment being the mentorship.
In the enterprise, we see the formation of comprehensive, overall ties of social
connection through mentor-mentee relationships. In such ties, the questions con-
cerning the relationships between work and moral character, between sentiments
and reason, between rule-by-man and rule-by-law, between righteousness and
beneﬁts, were not only crucial theoretical questions concerning the transition from
74

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

the traditional to the modern, but also crucial practical knowledge concerning the
transition “from the abstract to the concrete.” Similar to what family is to society,
the mentorship was, to the danwei system, a cell body. It was the most basic unit,
and also the most active, most tenacious unit. In other words, the danwei was a
living organism. If one side of the socialist rule-of-virtue redistribution system was
the “new rule-of-virtue” deﬁned by the communist ideology, then the other side
should be the day-to-day ethics hidden in the mentorships and other speciﬁc rela-
tionships. It can be said that the mentorship constituted a latent “knowledge sys-
tem” under the socialist system; contradictions existed between this knowledge
system and the knowledge system established by the ofﬁcial discourse system of
class struggle.67 Therefore, a characteristic of knowledge governance under the
danwei system was the co-existence of and confrontation between the big tradition
of class struggle and the small traditions of patronage, faction and mentorship
within the enterprise, and the co-existence of and confrontation between the big
knowledge about shaping the socialist new persons and the small knowledge about
the heartwarming mentor-mentee friendship that served as the basis of social mores.
However, in such co-existence and confrontation, the mentorship was still quite
fragile. It was vulnerable to the inﬂuence of the administrative system and resource
allocation in the danwei system, the dominant logic of which is still the logic of
administration. Besides, the incessant upgrading of skills and technologies was also
prone to weaken the technical authority of the mentor. In addition, “equalization”
under the socialist system also constantly posed a challenge to the mentorship. Of
course, in the enterprises under the danwei system before the reform and
opening-up, due to the lack of personnel mobility, the mentorship was relatively
stable. After the market-oriented reform, with the increasing demand of efﬁciency
in industrial production, and growing personnel mobility, the “teach, help, and
lead” under the mentorship gradually became a method of human capital cultiva-
tion. Capitalization and marketization squeezed the space for the role of moral
feelings, the heartwarming friendship between mentors and mentees gradually
became a thing of the past. However, we also see that the mentorship still played an
important role under certain conditions. For example, during the state-owned
enterprise transformation, the mentor-mentee relationship became an important
channel for the unemployed and laid-off workers to obtain social support.68
After a long period of silence, Western mentorship has recently begun to revive
in the production arena, due to the demand on technology inheritance by product
diversiﬁcation and individualization.69 The continuation of the mentorship under
the danwei system, is perhaps not so much related to technology inheritance as to
the formation of new labor relations in the enterprise.

The Unity Mechanism Within the Danwei
75

The danwei system is rooted in concrete social mores. Beside the micro
mechanism of the mentorship, the family and the community are also essential
elements in mores governance.
The emergence of danwei as a type of “welfare community” had special his-
torical conditions, for example, the implementation of the ﬁxed-employment sys-
tem, the expansion of the collective welfare fund, the transition from labor
insurance to danwei insurance, and the policy of self-sufﬁcient economic devel-
opment.70 Under such historical conditions, danwei gradually integrated with the
community, assuming more and more social service functions, which led to the
phenomenon of “the enterprise running the society.” In the “communitized” dan-
wei, community management, family structure, neighbor relationships, etc., were
all closely related to the enterprise. The danwei became the most basic social unit in
the urban grassroots society.
In the danwei system, all the events during a worker’s entire life course,
including birth, illness, old age, death, etc., were all related with the danwei. “In a
urban community, any member of the society must belong to a certain danwei.
When they study, they belong to a school danwei; when they start work, they
belong to a work danwei; after they retire, they not only belong to the original work
danwei, but also belong to a street danwei… In sum, from the cradle to the tomb,
people simply could do without the danwei. The danwei not only provided its
members with economic beneﬁts in return for their work, but also provided them
with all kinds of social security services and social welfare through housing
allotment, public health care, nurseries, kindergartens, canteens, baths, etc., and
even set up service companies or collective enterprises to solve their children’s
employment difﬁculties. Moreover, the danwei also gave its members action rights
inside and outside the danwei, as well as a social identity and social political
status.”71
The danwei not only had direct responsibility for its members, but also had joint
responsibility for the families of its members. Through such arrangements as spouse
worker, replacement worker, family relationships were also been included in the
scope of corporate governance. Take “spouse worker” as an example, in 1958,
under the slogans, the “Great Leap Forward,” “let Marshal Steel raise the tent” and
“emancipate women’s labor force,” a large number of workers were recruited,
among them were a batch of housewives in the name of “spouse workers.” Besides,
district-level and street-level authorities also organized housewives to set up col-
lective businesses to engage in production, processing and life services. In 1961 and
1962, in order to adapt to the economic adjustment, these workers were let go in
workforce downsizing, among them were over 50,000 “spouse workers.” Since
1963, as the national economy began to improve, the enterprises, one after another,
started recruiting new workers from the society again.72 In the era of the planned

The Relationship Between the Enterprises and the Workers …

economy, the recruitment of “spouse workers” was a widespread phenomenon
under the danwei system. But when the reform of state-owned enterprises began,
these people became an irremovable “burden” for their enterprises and the local
governments.73 The institutional arrangement of “spouse workers” was concerned
with many sides, including the family, the enterprise, the community, and the
government, etc. The so-called “separation of government and enterprises” just
involved the treatment of “spouse workers.” The so-called “ding zhi” (replacement
worker) phenomenon was also quite common in the danwei. It means that at the
retirement of the parents, their children succeed them in their work. “Ding zhi” for a
time was an important channel for the educated urban youth to get back to the cities.
Within a period of time after the reform and opening-up, the “ding zhi” phe-
nomenon continued to exist in a certain scope, and under certain conditions.
The workers’ families, when further organized, made up the danwei community.
A community under the danwei system was a “welfare community.” The enterprise
and the community coincided in certain areas, with the enterprise being embedded
in the community. Such phenomenon of the enterprise and the community being
mutually embedded in one another was quite common among the large and medium
sized state-owned enterprises. The residents of the community were colleagues
when they went to work, and became neighbors when they came back home. They
established the most common social relationships in various activities and rituals
through having daily communication, exchange of marriage, etc., and thus main-
tained the most basic social norms and ethics. The characteristics of the danwei
community were most clearly shown in the “third-front” factories. The “Third-Front
Construction” had a large scale and a long front, and generally breached the
principle of “do what is within one’s means.” Its layout was overly dispersed, with
some danweis going too deep into the mountains. Being far from the cities and
towns, trafﬁc inconveniences brought the workers tremendous difﬁculties in life.
Besides, the state policies at that time emphasized production but neglected living
conditions; there was no guarantee for the workers’ social welfare.74 Under such
conditions of production and life, these people who had shared destinies were
greatly inclined to form a community where they could watch one another’s back
and help one another. Many third-front factories were like enclaves in the local
areas. It was hard for the workers to blend in with the local language environment
and local customs. However, this situation helped deepening the integration of the
enterprise and the community. It can even be said that the community thus formed
was a proper part of the factory; factory construction in fact included community
construction.
73For example, the widespread problem of “7 May family workers” exist in many places. The
so-called “7 May family workers” refers to the workers’ family members who, in the 1960s and
1970s, went out of their home to participate in productive labor or self-help production projects on
various job positions in the enterprises, following Chairman Mao’s “7 May Instruction.” They
have registered urban permanent residence, but are not taken on by the labor department, and do
not have formal employee status. They have not participated in the basic old-age insurance plan.
74See Ren (2001).

In conclusion, no matter from which perspective, the perspective of the men-
torship, or the family, or the community, the danwei presents to us much richer
contents than bureaucracy does. The general structure of social mores which was
formed on the basis of these concrete institutions was, in a sense, the “law” of the
danwei system, was also its essential element for creating unity and the institutional
spirit working behind it.

Changes in Labor Relations
in the Dual-Track System Reform
The year of 1978 was a watershed in contemporary Chinese history. In the thirty
years before 1978, the governance of the whole society was realized through the
overall authority or mobilized mass movements. However, after 1978, in different
stages of the reform, different strategies were adopted so that various ﬁelds of the
social economy achieved various degrees of growth and development. In the ﬁrst
ten years of the reform, the dualist social structure, with the dual-track system as the
core mechanism, occupied the dominant position. It not only adopted the contract
system widely in the countryside and the cities to foster social economic forces
from the grassroots society, but also used the collective system, a fuzzy property
rights model, to solve the structural problem of the original planned economic
system. Since the 1990s, the central government made great efforts to promote the
marketization reform, which led to rapid development of China’s private economy.
In the meantime, the tax-sharing system reform fundamentally changed the rela-
tionship between the central government and the local governments; and the social
structure began to form a new pattern in the process of interaction between market
and power. In the 21st century, with China’s rapid integration into the global
economic activities, its own structural transformation also faced unprecedented
challenges. As a result, the strategies of public governance and overall social
construction have become the fundamental issues of social development.
4.1
The Dualist Social Structure Under
the Dual-Track System
In the late 1970s, the construction of China’s socialist society took a completely
different direction. Deng Xiaoping’s reform guideline was nothing like Mao
Zedong’s political thought of achieving industrial accumulation through the overall
state system and overcoming the absolute authority of such a system through mass

mobilizations. The objective of Deng Xiaoping’s policy was to shape a new type of
socialist political economic system through expanding the economic vitality of the
grassroots society.
To achieve the above general objective, the reform began with transforming the
production relations of the rural grassroots organizations. It broke the People’s
Commune system which had a strong ideological color, carried out re-adjustment of
the land use right and usufruct in the rural areas, and started the ﬁrst wave of
decentralization. The establishment of the rural household contract responsibility
system not only boosted the peasants’ production enthusiasm and labor produc-
tivity, and increased the efﬁciency of land use right transactions, but also, and more
importantly, brought the peasants back to the structure of family operation, where
the family was the basic unit for organizing production. Family-based land oper-
ation had been the basic pattern of traditional agricultural production in China, and
was the foundation for maintaining the peasants’ life and the rural order. Except in
the period of the People’s Commune, the expansion of agricultural collective
cooperative organizations never removed this foundation.1 Therefore, the policy of
“bao chan dao hu” (ﬁxing farm output quotas for each household) was the primary
policy of “bo luan fan zheng” (bring order out of chaos) proposed by Deng
Xiaoping. Shifting the foundation of the social structure of the vast rural areas back
to the family was an important sign of the restoration of social order. In the early
1980s, “ﬁxing farm output quotas for each household” did not directly involve the
structure of urban-rural relations. In fact, in the early period of the agricultural
reform, the liberalization of agricultural production and the ﬁxed-term household
contract responsibility system led to a signiﬁcant increase in agricultural produc-
tivity; agricultural and sideline products began to have a surplus; small country fairs
reopened; and the rural households began to have small savings.
In 1984, the state issued a policy permitting the transfer of land use rights. After
that, village cadres began to adjust the distribution of land according to the changes
in village population, which, to a certain extent, weakened the peasants’ conﬁdence
in land security.2 In the mean time, due to the limit of scale in family-based land
operation, the land yield could not continue to improve, large amounts of surplus
labor appeared in the rural areas. The four basic elements of land transfer, surplus
labor, household operation, and small-scale fund reserves constituted the precon-
ditions for the spontaneous rise of township enterprises in the countryside. A more
important cause for the rise of township enterprises was the conditional decen-
tralization advocated by Deng Xiaoping. Due to this policy, the administrative
power of the grassroots-level authorities was not weakened by the household
responsibility system. On the contrary, they had more space to put their power to
good use with the implementation of the land transfer policy.3 In comparison, the
1Fei Xiaotong’s idea of rural industrialization was also based on the principles of land system and
family organization.

cities lagged behind. The relatively closed planning system and market in the cities,
the serious shortage of light industry products and articles of daily use, as well as
the double-track pricing caused by urban-rural separation, led to the phenomenon
that the primary products of the township enterprises “encircled the cities from the
countryside.” The strategy of “encircling the cities from the countryside” was very
successful at ﬁrst. In the vast areas of eastern China, the ownership relations of
township enterprises were unclear; they largely existed in the name of collective
ownership, and made up an important part of the local governments’ budget
revenue.
The models of possession and operation of the contract system were closely
related to the ﬁscal relations between the central and local governments since the
1980s. During this period, the central government and the provincial governments
adopted an approach of negotiation to determine the division of revenue, and
conduct tax management. The provincial governments followed suits in adopting
such a system and passed it on until the township level. Such a ﬁscal system based
on negotiation led to a special phenomenon, that is, as the level of government
became more grassroots, the constraints from the system and laws became smaller,
and the space for negotiation became larger, the opportunities for making policy
choices increased, and the actual power also became greater. The combination of
administrative power with small-scale family capital, and the social capital effec-
tively operated and accumulated through administrative power and kinship relations
could be easily expressed through a vague institutional discourse, that is, collective
ownership, which could also account for the origin of the concept of “corporate
government.” Among them, the so-called institutional-political discourse of the
collective ownership was the easiest to get the legitimacy of ideology. Due to their
indigenous nature, the township enterprises did not directly contribute to rural
urbanization. The effect of the township enterprises was not limited to this aspect.
Because they absorbed the surplus rural labor in the surrounding areas, and were the
ﬁrst to open a less liquid labor market, the peasants’ different professional identities
began to take shape; they income also increased. However, in terms of organiza-
tional rules and distribution system, due to the fuzzy ownership and the concen-
tration of land rights, the income and beneﬁts were tilted towards the cadres and the
patriarchs; and the administrative power and the family power began to coalesce in
the social economy. As a result, the township enterprises in some areas became
important platforms for exploitation at the grassroots level and for privatization of
collective assets.
More crucially, success in the township enterprises’ initial capital accumulation
was due to the rigid system of the cities. The system reform started from the rural
areas. The cities, in comparison, continued to be rigid, closed, and crisis-ridden. At
that time, the cities in China were faced with unprecedented pressures. The return of
the educated urban youth brought severe unemployment and security crises;
deep-rooted and widespread social contradictions and issues left over from history
were still waiting for solutions; the state-owned enterprises under the planning
system were plagued by overstafﬁng and low efﬁciency. In the early 1980s, in order
to solve the various social contradictions in the cities, the state adopted the
4.1
The Dualist Social Structure Under the Dual-Track System
81

administration-oriented danwei system, and formed the vertical structure of allo-
cation and distribution of personnel, property rights, resources and interests within
the administrative hierarchy. Frankly speaking, relying on the danwei system to
reshape the administrative order, incorporating all state-owned enterprises and
institutions into the bureaucratic system, bringing the production and life in the
cities back onto the track of order, were still the primary tasks under the guideline of
“bring order out of chaos.” The slack administration caused by the “Cultural
Revolution” began to become orderly; the thought liberation movement made
progress with administrative support; a large number of urban idle personnel were
resettled. However, with the gradual unfolding of the urban reform, the drawbacks
of the danwei system began to emerge. All the departments, sectors, institutions in
the cities were still in the pattern of the overall system, which had the administrative
characteristics of vertical restraints, barriers between different departments and
regions, overstafﬁng in organizations, power supremacy, factional struggles, mutual
buck-passing, etc. The administrativization of the enterprise led to overstafﬁng and
low efﬁciency. The residents’ living conditions remained on the same level with the
past. A large number of enterprises and workers had a fuzzy identity, which was
referred to as the “big collective.” In sharp contrast with the vibrant rural com-
munities, the urban communities were still under airtight control, and were
enveloped in a dreary atmosphere.
Although since 1983, a small number of state-owned enterprises began to follow
the lead of the countryside to experiment with the contract system, because the
enterprises could not break away from the state’s administrative control and budget
constraints, they could only operate on some unwritten rules found out by them-
selves, making tentative steps to seek breakthroughs in operation. At the same time,
the state’s attempt to substitute the contract system with income tax did not work
out. From 1986 onwards, with the implementation of the policy of “separating
government functions from enterprise management,” the contract system was
quickly rolled out in the state-owned enterprises. In this process, the administrative
pattern based on the danwei system and the simulated-price market based on the
collective system became the two basic institutional frameworks for the operation
of the enterprises. In the beginning, the enterprise reform in the cities did not break
the power structure of the state ownership. The enterprise still could not make its
own decisions over many issues, such as the appointment and removal of personnel
in its executive level, the resource allocation right in production, and the price
negotiation right in product sales, etc. However, although no changes were made in
the ownership rights, the system of overall responsibility by factory director in
administration was established, entitling the directors to some management rights
within a certain scope.
Deng Xiaoping’s approach to promote urban reforms was very similar to his
creative thinking about “one country, two systems.” The application of this strategic
policy is not limited to diplomatic maneuver aimed at the reuniﬁcation of the
motherland, but also served as important measures for promoting political and
economic reforms in domestic cities. The realistic meaning of “one country, two
systems” for the domestic economic ﬁeld was to make small changes and small

progress in the vast inland urban communities, while carrying out bold experiments
in establishing a brand-new system in the coastal areas to give reform incentives to
the vast inland. In the early stage of the reform, this plan was quite safe and
plausible, because at that time all kinds of social contradictions left over from
history were accumulated in the cities, people’s ideas severely lagged behind,
factors affecting social stability were easily triggered. Indeed, the establishment of
special economic zones (SEZs) in the coastal areas was a great project of system
innovation. The construction of China’s special economic zones was a miracle that
had never been seen in the world’s socio-economic history in terms of adminis-
trative power, ﬁnancial system, resource allocation, and investment conditions and
personnel arrangements.
The human, material, ﬁnancial and policy resources of the entire country were
used to develop several SEZs. Undoubtedly, it is impossible to calculate the
advantages and disadvantages of this solely from the economic point of view. But
Deng Xiaoping’s intentions perhaps did not just rest at this micro level. This policy
focused more on the overall situation of China’s reform. The SEZs were indeed a
privileged testing ground in a special era. And on the basis of the original dualist
urban-rural structure in China, a structure of inter-regional difference and hierarchy
was also established. This development model, in imitation of the four Asian
Tigers, provided the rudiment for the development of China’s export-oriented
economy in the next two to three decades. Unlike the urban-rural separation system,
the SEZs gave “mobility” in its real sense to China’s modernization transition.
Whether it is the inward ﬂow of foreign capital and technology, or the outward ﬂow
of resources and talents from the inland, such mobility liberated China’s folk
vitality. In the early stage of the reform, the folk vitality was no longer conﬁned to
family production and grassroots township economy, but had large-scale release in
China’s relatively developed coastal areas. “Go to the SEZs” seemed to have
become the only way for people to wash away the scars left by the “Cultural
Revolution” and to look forward to a bright future after “bringing order out of
chaos.” The SEZs began to fully demonstrate China’s power-intensive and
labor-intensive “development advantages.” The state’s intensive power could
instantly remove all institutional barriers and equip the SEZs with institutional
privileges and low-cost or even free land. In addition, the low labor costs due to the
extremely low standard of living provided a huge population advantage for the
development of export processing industry.
Whether in terms of actual life conditions or in terms of people’s values, the
SEZs demonstrated an enormous power of conquest. It created the myth of
super-speed economic development; it displayed the charm of modern life; it
instantly smashed the repeated propaganda of the media, the novelty world that
people saw with their own eyes swept away all the old systems and old notions
from their heads. The people of that era witnessed the power of “social contagion”
and social mobility, which were concepts used by the early Western sociologists.
And more active, more mobile than the reality of social mobility, was people’s
yearning for a splendid life that only belonged to the SEZs. The yearning heart is
the source of all changes. The SEZs eventually created a dualist structure of
4.1

imagination and reality that had a deeper impact on the people’s heart than the
dualist structure of social division. In this dualist structure, hope harbored dis-
content; the two elements became the strongest driving force pushing people to
change their destiny. At the same time, the market-oriented structure of labor
relations adopted within the SEZs seemed to have become a form much admired
and emulated by various enterprises in the inland, which played a very important
exemplary role in the adjustment of labor relations in the enterprises in the 1990s.
The divide between the cities and the countryside and the enlarging
inter-regional gaps led to great social and economic tensions and the real differences
in social status, and also led to cross-boundary transactions between power and
economy. In the rural areas, the policy of ﬁxing farm output quotas for each
household shifted the basic rural production unit back to the family, but with the
collectivization of rural lands, the peasants could only manage small patches of
land, and made less and less investment in public facilities. In the mean time, the
primary accumulation of the township enterprises began to be transferred to some
departments of interests, or to the hands of private and family forces, following the
trajectory of the administrative power in the name of the collective system. In the
cities, the state-owned enterprises also sought to break the constraints of the danwei
system by resorting to the collective system; they sought all kinds of opportunities
to form associations with various extra-institutional elements. However, the tradi-
tional danwei system still had overall control over the majority of the national
resources. In the SEZs and mega-cities, large amounts of foreign capital, surplus
rural labor and elites who escaped the constraints of the traditional system began to
converge, releasing great vigor and vitality. However, due to the enclave effect of
its policy privileges and the “price scissors” mechanism of product pricing, the
administrative power at all levels also gathered here to conduct transactions in
public or in secret, which resulted in rampant ofﬁcial speculation, and aroused
widespread public grievances.
Due to the demands of the progressive reform and the conditions of the shortage
economy, no matter between the ownership and the usufruct of rural lands, or
between the product prices of the township enterprises and those of the state-owned
enterprises, or between the SEZs and the cities of the interior, a dualist social
structure based on the dual-track system was formed. In the ﬁrst decade of China’s
reform, to avoid affecting the stability and order of the main social structure and
ideology, the strategy of “encircling the centre from the periphery” was adopted.
Reform was ﬁrst carried out in the periphery, such as the countryside, the township
enterprises, and the SEZs. The resulting effect of contrast between the core and the
periphery could be used to stimulate the transformation of the core.
Even in the relationship between the central and local governments, Deng
Xiaoping also boldly carried out the system reform of decentralization (transferring
power to the local authorities), thus fundamentally promoted the smooth imple-
mentation of these three reforms. The new measure, later called “ﬁscal federalism”
by economists, divided the government revenues and other taxes generated by the
state-owned enterprises between the central government and the provincial gov-
ernments according to ﬁxed amounts or ﬁxed proportions. The same ﬁscal contract

was also implemented level by level between the provincial governments and the
governments at all lower levels, so that the local governments’ power and ﬁnancial
income could enjoy guaranteed increase. Such a policy gave full play to the ini-
tiatives of the grassroots government in reform, and expanded the arena where they
could exercise their powers. In the early stage of reform, this measure had the effect
of fully mobilizing the reform vitality of the grassroots, especially at a time when
the administrative system at various levels and the ideology of the people were still
in a rigid state. But after the grassroots society had achieved the primary accu-
mulation of wealth, ﬁscal decentralization gradually became a tool used by the local
governments in protection of their own interests, as well as in their game playing
with higher levels of governments and in their competition with same-level gov-
ernments. It was an inescapable fact that decentralization was neither conducive to
breaking the various types of dual-track systems mentioned above, nor to the
formation of a uniﬁed market nationwide. On the contrary, at a time when the
overall system had not fundamentally changed, and the transfer of personnel was
still controlled by the central government, decentralization increased the weight of
power, and thereby also enhanced the monopolistic power of the local state-owned
enterprises. This factor directly contributed to the phenomena of “price break-
through” and “trading power for money by exploiting the price gaps” in the late
1980s. In the mean time, it also led to the state-owned enterprises’ crisis where “bad
old practices die hard.”
Here, it is worth noting that the existence of a dual-track system in various ﬁelds
in the early stage of the reform and opening up was a practical measure adopted by
the central government for soundly and progressively advancing the reform. And
the grassroots societies and enterprises also explored and found the way to deal with
the dual-track system. From the institutional point of view, this was reﬂected in the
appearance of a variety of forms of the collective system. The collective system is a
vague form of ownership. It is neither state ownership, nor purely private
ownership. As a result, the actual power and capital in its operation could come
from a variety of ownerships including state ownership, ownership by the grass-
roots government, ownership by the local clanship forces, or even secret private
ownership. It could serve as a mechanism for breaking the original system and
promoting the development of productive forces; it could also be used as a black
box for transfer of state assets; it could serve as the basis for local community
construction; it could also be used as a platform for extracting beneﬁts from the
peasants. In sum, the rise of the collective system fully mobilized the local vitality
for social and economic development, but in the stage of primitive capital accu-
mulation it also harmed social justice, and widened the gap between the rich and the
poor.

socio-economic effects in the market sense. The ﬁrst was the vicious cycle of the
principal-agent operations under information asymmetry; the second was that the
rent-seeking behaviors of the privileged began to reap the most revenue. Since a
uniﬁed market could not be established in the dual-track system, the government
had to give out huge subsidies to stabilize the prices of daily necessities. As a result,

the central government suffered from ﬁnancial distress, and such abnormal phe-
nomenon even appeared that the wholesale prices were higher than the retail prices.
What was even worse, the privileged and the powerful forced their way into
important trading activities, which led to rampant ofﬁcial speculation. The crisis at
the end of the 1980s showed that the most prominent contradictions encountered by
China’s social economy ten years after the reform were not price problems, nor
purely problems of the macro social system. When the contradictions of the dualist
structure began to intensify, when power began to seize enormous amounts of
national resources by taking advantage of policy privileges and the old system, the
overall social structure must be transformed to maintain the stability of reform and
opening up.
4.2
Township Enterprises: The Labor Relations Under
the Collective System
With their rise and prosperity in the 1980s, the township enterprises became
important pillars of the rural economy. By 1987, the gross output value of the
township enterprises surpassed the gross output value of agriculture for the ﬁrst
time. The ﬂourishing of township enterprises played important historical roles in
absorbing rural surplus labor, increasing the peasants’ income, breaking the single
ownership structure and single industrial structure in the rural areas, and promoting
the construction of small towns.4
4.2.1
The Structure of Multiple Ownerships
In terms of ownership rights, the ownership structure of township enterprises was
very complicated. Firstly, over a longer historical period, the institutional founda-
tion of the township enterprises came from the commune and brigade run enter-
prises under the People’s Commune before the reform.5 Although these had all
4In the above-mentioned three rural social changes, peasants were the earliest beneﬁciaries of
reform, with the urban-rural gap signiﬁcantly narrowed before 1985. In 1978, the average income
of the urban residents was equivalent to 2.36 times that of the rural residents, but in 1984 this ratio
dropped to 1.86. After 1984, the urban-rural income ratio ﬂuctuated, but until the year of 1989,
when the ratio was 2.31, the ratio remained below the level of 1978. See Zhao (1994).
5Before the establishment of the people’s commune, township enterprises had been called
“commune run industry.” In the early period of the people’s commune, they were called “people’s
commune industry.” From 1960s to 1984, they were called “commune and brigade run enter-
prises.” In March 1984, the term of “township enterprises” (xiang zhen qi ye) came into use. In
1983, the central government decided to cancel the people’s communes and establish township
governments, and the name of “commune and brigade run enterprises” needed to be changed.
After the cancellation of the people’s commune system, the original commune and brigade

along been regarded as “collective ownership,” in the course of institutional evo-
lution from the mutual-aid group to the establishment of cooperatives, then to the
People’s Commune, the peasants in fact gave up control over the means of pro-
duction gradually. In the ﬁrst two periods, the peasant could still use their with-
drawal rights to monitor and restrain the collective production and business
activities. After the switch over to the People’s Communes, “due to the combination
of the collective ownership in the legal sense and the household registration sys-
tem,” the peasants were deprived of withdrawal rights.6 Thus, voluntary union of
assets and cooperation were replaced by the government’s control over collective
assets, which now had obvious features of the state ownership. This was not much
different from the danwei system which had level-by-level delegation of the whole
people ownership following the administrative hierarchy.
Secondly, the “collective ownership by all the peasants” and the power of the
residents’ congress to decide on the enterprise executive rights, which were stip-
ulated in “Regulations on Collective Ownership Enterprises in the Countryside,”
were completely similar to the stipulations in “Regulations of the People’s Republic
of China on Enterprises of Collective Ownership by the Working People in Cities
and Towns.”7 Moreover, not all peasants were exercising their ownership rights as
enterprise employees. It is hard to imagine how local peasants outside an enterprise
could exercise its ownership rights. Therefore, “all the peasants” in essence had the
meaning of “all the people” in ownership, which had a strong ideological color.
That means, a dimension of public ownership was contained in the collective
ownership.8 In this regard, the township government, as the agent of collective
rights, had legitimacy in representing the ownership rights in this dimension. The
phenomenon of “no initial contract”9 can also be explained with this, such a type of
ownership was not determined by contract.
Although all the peasants had nominal ownership over the collective enterprises,
in reality, because the representation of the residents’ congress (i.e., the peasant
representative conference) existed only in name, the peasants (especially those who
were not employed by local enterprises) did not enjoy such rights. However, in the
sense of common ownership, that is, under the conditions of the collective own-
ership of rural land, the peasants did enjoy ownership rights. In the vast rural areas,
the peasants were fully aware of the basic income level of the land because they had
farmed on the land for generations; they also had an understanding of the land
system that determined their lives. For the peasants who worked in the collective
enterprises were each placed under the management of their corresponding departments, the names
and contents of these enterprises became clearly deﬁned.

enterprises or whose own land was requisitioned by the enterprises, they would
surely do calculations of the loss in land management and land usufruct to evaluate
their own income. As for the problem of surplus of collective property, ﬁrstly, the
peasants would do an overall estimation of the income from farming the contractual
amount of collective land that they lost (including the output value of the years
when they do not farm), and calculate the surplus on the basis of this estimation.
Secondly, as members of the collective, the peasants were entitled to sharing a part
of the enterprise’s proﬁts. Of course, the veriﬁcation and recourse of the latter were
uncertain, not subject to any contractual restrictions of the enterprise, and could
only be traced back to the terms of the original land contract.
In short, the fundamental basis of the common ownership relations in the col-
lective ownership system was the collective ownership of land. The peasants’ other
demands besides land operation conversion were in the dimension of governance.
Otherwise, it would be difﬁcult for us to explain the function of “land contract” as
an intermediate link. The contract system under the collective ownership of land led
to the concept of dual ownerships by the peasants. The contract system deﬁned
the scope of land income for the peasants, that is, to use the family rather than the
collective as the unit for calculation. In the mean time, under the protection of the
collective ownership, the peasants understood the usufruct within the contract
period as ownership rights, because the national policy made a commitment to
stability. Here, what is most interesting is that when the peasants cared about the
ownership rights of the township enterprises and the associated surplus problem,
their point of departure was not the enterprise’s contractual relationships, but their
own land rights. However, we cannot equate the claims of rights based on the
collective ownership of land with the rural community members’ demands on social
welfare.10
4.2.2
Proﬁt-Making Activities with the Priority Being
Given to Business Operation
Without doubt, the process of setting up and operating a township enterprise was
also a process of continuous investment of resources like technology, capital,
information, and social relations in the form of individuals’ private investment, thus
the phenomenon of “the second contract” appeared. As a result, problems con-
cerning the private ownership also appeared. Because according to the regulations
10Chen Jianbo believes that the property rights boundaries of the township enterprises were
determined in the transaction between the enterprises and the community/government. The
essential elements in the business operation of the enterprises (land, labor force, capital) needed to
be provided by the community government, while the government participated in the sharing of
net surplus of the enterprise and in the mean time carved up the decision-making space of the
enterprise. In this reciprocal transaction, the acquisition of operating elements became the pre-
requisites for determining property rights boundaries. See Chen (1995).

of the two ownership systems mentioned above, the directors only managed the
enterprise as an agent; the issue of ownership was not involved. But in fact, these
agents often regarded the enterprise as their home, and made continuous investment
of various types of capital and resources in the process of their agential manage-
ment, and therefore had unequivocal demands on owning the surplus. Although
such claims of rights were not honored by the original contract, their legitimacy,
however, could not be denied. Because generally speaking, the modiﬁcation of the
ownership structure of an enterprise is often achieved with the investment of capital
as the primary condition. Any private capital investment by individuals in the
operation of the enterprise belongs to the category of dividing the ownership, that
is, what we call “share holding.” It is just that when there was no clear statement in
the original contract, we cannot judge which part of the surplus was generated by
additional individual investment; but we cannot completely deny the investors’
claims of ownership rights. Such claims were not formed on the basis of exclusive
management monopoly or social network,11 but were determined by the deﬁnition
of ownership itself. Without doubt, because of the composite nature of the own-
ership form of the township enterprise, the individual investors could not appro-
priate the entire enterprise to themselves for whatever reasons.
Interestingly, the dimension of private ownership in the township enterprise was
not just limited to individual investors, but also reﬂected in the process of
share-holding reform. According to the cases provided by She Xiaoye, what made
this reform special was that it was not aimed at the allocation or division of shares,
but used the allocation of shares as a means to stealthily alter the contents of the ﬁrst
two types of ownership mentioned above, to substitute the legal terms of the public
ownership and common ownership with those of the private ownership inherent to
the share holding system. The essence of this transformation toward the corporate
system was not to clarify how much percentage of shares should be given to whom,
in “dividing up the family properties.” Its essence lay in the fact that this movement
of system change, promoted by government policies at the time, eventually changed
the nature of ownership, turning the non-private part in the collective ownership
into a privatized ownership structure built according to the proportions of share
holding. In that one-time equity allocation, the most important change was to
substitute the (public or common) community ownership with the (private) cor-
porate ownership. Moreover, if precise calculation was done according to the
ownership structure, the value of shares obtained by the peasants would be sig-
niﬁcantly lower than the accumulated income from farming the contracted land.
This provides a side perspective, from which we can explain the rapid accumulation
of local capital in the process of system transformation in the 1990s. The prices of
such a system transformation were the replacement of the ownership system and the
peasants’ loss of their rights of possession.
From the starting point of the three ideal types of possession, we can see that the
ownership form embodied by the township enterprises showed a very subtle and

strange phenomenon: the grassroots township government maintained that it was
the owner; the collective or its members believed that they were the owners; the

also
believed
that

owner.
The
ﬁrst
self-afﬁrmation was determined by the whole people ownership with the state as the
agent, so it was the most unclear. Although the second self-afﬁrmation narrowed
down the scope of ownership to the collective, such a common ownership was not
directly embodied in the property rights of the enterprises, but embodied in the
collective ownership of land. The third self-afﬁrmation, to a certain extent,
acknowledged the justiﬁability of investment ownership. However, it was difﬁcult
to distinguish, with the public and private being mixed together, and had an “in-
formal” quality. The result of such a composite and complex ownership structure of
the township enterprise was that it became impossible to clearly deﬁne the subject
of ownership of the enterprise. Different forms of ownership were intertwined with
each other, and tied each other down. What economists call “fuzzy property
rights”12 refers just to this phenomenon. Comparatively speaking, the township
enterprises in the southern part of Jiangsu Province had relatively stronger foun-
dations as commune and brigade enterprises in the earlier stage. They also had
obvious characteristics of the overall system and obvious collective attributes. Their
assets and capital structure were largely derived from the government and the
collective. For these reasons, the three forms of ownership in these township
enterprises were prone to converge in the same direction, resulting in the phe-
nomenon of the so-called “chang shang zheng fu” (corporate government).
However, later in the process of system transformation we see that because many
gaps existed among the three types of ownership, some people with great political
power or great capital power took advantage of the state policies, cleverly moved
the boundaries between the ownership systems, stealthily altered the contents of
the ownership systems in different dimensions, and promoted the privatization of
the township enterprises. This factor should prove more powerful in explaining the
decline of township enterprises than other factors like market competition, low
technical level, lack of funds, etc.
The reason why the township enterprises could come into being and truly start
operating was closely related to the institutional environment in the ﬁrst ten years of
the reform and opening up. At the beginning of the reform, the development of
township enterprises beneﬁted from the structure of the dual-track system. In a
sense, the dual-track system had a “shelving effect”: that is, protect and close the
stocks in terms of “possession”, do not fundamentally change the basic structure of
the original system; strengthen the role of “operation”, and expand the accumula-
tion of mobile resources through nurturing and developing the increments.13 This
means that the dual-track system was in fact a socio-economic structure of seg-
mentation and juxtaposition. On the one hand, the foundation of property rights
under the planned economic system, that is, the ownership structure, was
12See Li (1995).
13See Zhang (2006).

temporarily shelved, and excluded from current consideration; on the other hand,
the intension was to liberate the land usufruct and the enterprise management rights
to stimulate the growth of new elements in various socio-economic ﬁelds, so as to
improve transaction efﬁciency and change the social structure through the logic of
increments.14
The liberation of land usufruct and management rights was achieved through the
“contract system.” In the ﬁrst ten years of the reform, “the household contract
responsibility system” separated the land usufruct from the collective ownership of
land. Such a “contract system” set aside the ownership principle of “three levels
(group, village, township) of ownership, the team (group) as the basis,” and des-
ignated the household as the basic unit of land usufruct, that is, the so-called “bao
chan dao hu” (ﬁxing farm output quotas for each household), or “bao gan dao hu”
(work contracted to households).15 The implementation of the household contract
responsibility system was unfolded in three main aspects. Firstly, the dual-track
pattern of individual (household) use and collective ownership was established, thus
separating the subject of land ownership from the subject of land usufruct.
Secondly, it established a performance-oriented ideology in the vast grassroots rural
areas, that is, the principles of production efﬁciency coming ﬁrst and proﬁtability
coming ﬁrst, so that land management obtained a higher position over land
ownership. Thirdly, the contracting of land gave a personalized basis of operation to
the original state ownership and collective ownership. In other words, a
quasi-contract form of product and commodity transaction came into being, which
spurred the non-state-owned sectors of the economy under the jurisdiction of the
local governments to seek and follow market rules in production, sales, pricing and
so on; and a completely different logic of increments was established.
14For example, Yang Xiaokai, Wang Jianguo, Willis had used 12 indices to describe the trans-
action efﬁciency of deﬁning three types of rights (right of use, right of transfer, right to earnings)
for 4 types of property (products, labor, land, ﬁnancial assets), so as to explain the social changes
in China’s rural areas in different stages in the 1980s. In the ﬁrst stage, the transaction efﬁciency of
deﬁning right of use and right to earnings for products and that of deﬁning right of use for labor
and land were signiﬁcantly improved. In the second stage, the transaction efﬁciency of deﬁning
right of transfer for products and labor and that of deﬁning right to earnings for labor were
signiﬁcantly improved; the transaction efﬁciency of deﬁning right of transfer for land was
somewhat improved. In the third stage, the transaction efﬁciency of deﬁning all three types of
rights for ﬁnancial assets was signiﬁcantly improved, and that of deﬁning right of transfer for land
was further improved. See Footnote 2.
15“Work contracted to households” means, the contractor household must pay agricultural tax to
the state, sell the products speciﬁed in the contract to the state, pay the common reserve fund and
public welfare fund to the collective, and the remaining products all belong to the peasants
themselves. “Fixing farm output quotas for each household” means implementing the policy of
“ﬁxing output, ﬁxing investment and ﬁxing workpoints.” The output in excess of the production
target belongs to the peasants, compensations should be made if the output falls short of the target.
At present, the form of “work contracted to households” is the most widely adopted. At that time a
saying was widely circulated in the countryside, “pay the due amount to the state, leave enough for
the collective, and the rest all belong to ourselves.” This is a true picture that shows the priority of
rural land use right.
4.2
Township Enterprises: The Labor Relations Under the Collective System
91

The extension of the contract system in the rural areas from the agricultural ﬁeld
to the industrial ﬁeld not only separated the land ownership from the land usufruct,
but also established the legitimacy of separating management rights from ownership
rights in the commune and brigade enterprises. At the same time, the management
rights of the township enterprises gradually formed a more complex structure.
According to the three provisions in Article 6 of “Regulations on Rural Collective
Ownership Enterprises,” “the rural collective ownership enterprises implement
autonomous operation, independent accounting, and assume sole responsibility for
their own proﬁts or losses”; “the rural collective ownership enterprises implement
multiple forms of management responsibility systems”; “the rural collective own-
ership enterprises can absorb investment shares under the precondition that the
nature of collective ownership is not changed.” These indicate that, ﬁrst of all, the
autonomy of the township enterprises was entirely based on the right to dispose of
proceeds. They were no longer subject to the control of the original redistribution
system. They had escaped from the constraints of the ownership system, and had
become relatively independent business entities with the characteristics of the
market system.16 Secondly, with the diversiﬁcation of management responsibility
systems, the autonomous status of the director (manager) under the contract system,
the rental system or the joint operation system was conﬁrmed. The personalized
form of management was established, that is, the principal-agent relationship had a
concrete agent person. Finally, in ownership structure, an opening was made for the
establishment of ownership through private capital investment, but such a kind of
capital participation could not fundamentally change the nature of collective
ownership. The latter two provisions, in fact, implied that the agents and investors
could enjoy full management rights.
Thus, the priority of management rights over ownership rights was demonstrated
in three aspects. Firstly, the contract system in agricultural production broke down
the collective ownership of land into individual households’ land use rights.
Secondly, the contract system in industrial production, to a great extent, removed
the constraints on the management rights of the township enterprises by ownership
rights, and established the priority of business operation and economic beneﬁts.
Finally, in the process of the government’s direct domination of the economic
activities, the contract system in local government ﬁnance, in the form of “bao gan”
(contract responsibility), extended the actual scope of action of the management
rights beyond the enterprise organization. As a result, we cannot accurately deﬁne
the boundaries of the organization. From these three aspects, the business structure
of the township enterprises exhibited several very special qualities.
Firstly, in terms of the organization of the enterprise, because of the “shelving
effect” of the dual-track system, that is, the ownership rights were sealed up as the
stock, the ownership, especially the collective ownership, could not provide com-
plete protection for its members. However, the institutional environment of the
ﬁnancial contract system only had constraints on the result, not on the process, of
16Szelényi (2010, pp. 42–53).
92

Changes in Labor Relations in the Dual-Track …

the enterprises’ internal management. As a result, the directors (managers) had
supreme business power and management power. Over a fairly long period of time,
the internal management and operation of the township enterprises were as elusive
as black holes, very hard to see clearly. This kind of typical authoritative man-
agement system did not give its employees much system space for exercising their
participatory rights, all the activities in the enterprise were basically centered
around production and sales. Under these conditions, as well as the path depen-
dence on autocracy inherited from the commune and brigade enterprises, and the
habit of arbitrary decision formed by administrative instructions, the directors
(managers), who “held full responsibility of the enterprise,” and “exercised their
powers on behalf of the enterprise,” often had dominant power in the enterprise’s
business operation. At a time when the market conditions were missing, and the
shortage of commodity supply was still severe, the contracting of management
rights could enhance efﬁciency in economic activities and form competitive
advantages through the concentration of power. Moreover, the power monopoly in
the enterprise also could ensure the secrecy of external transactions, which helped
to reduce the political risks of business operation.17
Comparatively speaking, property rights researchers are more willing to focus on
the principal-agent relationship of such enterprises. In essence, the principal-agent
relationship is determined by the ownership structure. However, as mentioned
above, due to the triple ownership of the township enterprise, none of the three
ownership forms in its ownership structure was complete, clear, and able to
establish a complete principal-agent contract. What could be done was that, under
different speciﬁc conditions, according to the different weights of the three types of
ownership, different types of principal-agent relationships be formed, and different
paths in ownership transformation be taken. In those places where the grassroots
township governments self-conﬁrmed that they were the owners and conducted
“self-agency,” such as in the southern part of Jiangsu Province, the governments
and the enterprises were mostly a merged structure. Such a relationship where the
17Of course, it is not enough to see only the authoritarian side, and those who think that township
enterprises only have the extensive management pattern, in fact, have not noticed the power of
spontaneous rationalization determined by the principle of supremacy of business operation.
Firstly, the workers’ discipline was strengthened, that is, the peasants gradually became qualiﬁed
enterprise employees through strict training in the rigid production system. Secondly, the enter-
prises’ learning ability for specialized knowledge was greatly improved; most township enterprises
would resort to every conceivable means to obtain specialized knowledge, such as digging talents,
stealing technology, imitating famous brands, optimizing production process. They took the lead
in rationalizing allocation of resources, organizational form and operating channels within the
enterprise in various links of business operation, including production process, technology, cir-
culation, sales, etc., and each did their best to obtain proﬁts by faithfully adhering to the principle
of rationalizing business operation and maximizing efﬁciency. Although the motivation of
rationalization only came from the business operators, there already existed the typical charac-
teristics of “rational economic activities,” a term used by Weber. Focusing on utility
(Nutzleistungen) to obtain the right of disposition, they adopted all means of raising funds
(Beschaffungsmittel) in a planned way to generate or transport utility. These activities all existed in
the monetary income forms of operation and management. See Weber (2005, pp. 10, 14).

principal and the agent were united in one, to a large extent, molded the township
and village governments into business entities with the qualities of a business
ﬁrm.18 In fact, the above-mentioned three cases were usually mixed. In other words,
it is precisely because under normal circumstances the three types of agential
situation all existed, and three different types of relationships between ownership
rights and management rights were often interwoven with one another, it became
more difﬁcult to resolve the “agential risk.” More importantly, the principal-agent
relationship between the ownership rights and the management rights was not
established by contract in a one-time deal. In reality, due to the conventional or
customary nature of the contract, sometimes it was unwritten, not formally signed.
In some cases, due to “adverse selection,” the principal would choose the agent
many times, resulting in repeated replacements of the agent.
4.2.3
The Dual-Track Governance System
From the institutional point of view, without the reform and opening up, there
would not have been the rise of township enterprises; without adhering to the
dual-track system in the system reform of the 1980s, the prosperity of township
enterprises would not have had the necessary structural conditions. The principle of
the dual-track system was “protect the stocks, cultivate the increments.” In the
reform from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, the so-called “stocks” referred to the
redistribution system of the planned economy. Particularly for the state-owned
enterprises on various administrative levels and the vast urban communities, to
rebuild the regime governance structure based on the danwei system, was a nec-
essary measure for cleaning up the mess left by the “Cultural Revolution,” and to
restore order in production and life. The so-called “increments” referred to culti-
vating non-system production vitality in the periphery of the stock system of the
planned economy (such as the introduction of the household contract responsibility
system in the rural areas), promoting the free ﬂow of resources, loosening the
system bottlenecks and the standardizing effect of the danwei system, and gradually
forming a preliminary market system. Chinese economists often regard this incre-
mental reform as the basis for the success of the Chinese-style progressive reform.19
They believe that even in the vast rural areas, the implementation of the household
contract responsibility system could not have proceeded without the precondition of
the dual-track system. For example, the state monopoly of grain purchasing was
continued, and the “dual price system” was adopted, rather than a “land reform
18See Oi (1995), Fan (1994), Shanhua and Hong (2002). However, to understand the issue from
the perspective of the form of whole-people ownership under state agency, there is no logic
contradiction between the agentic type of political power manager and the proﬁt-seeking type of
political power manager.

movement,” to inspire changes in the rural collective production system, so that an
overall “Pareto improvement” could be achieved.20
However, from the perspective of reform strategy, the purpose of the dual-track
system reform was to establish a relationship of mutual incentive between the
stocks and the increments. A more detailed explanation is as follows: on the basis of
maintaining the existing system stock, nurture and develop incremental accumu-
lation outside the original system, control excessive incremental expansion by
protecting existing stocks, avoid system risks caused by the increments’ deviation
from the logic of path dependence; and at the same time, gather the driving forces
for structural change through the accumulation of the increments, provoke the stress
response of the original system, so that a gradual transformation of the social
structure can be achieved.21 Therefore, from the perspective of regime governance,
the objective was to establish an “embedded relationship,” in Polanyi’s sense,
between the stocks and the increments through the logic of the dual-track system,
and in the mean time to ideologically reintroduce the hidden relations of market
exchange in the redistribution system, an idea from Iván Szelényi, and give them
solid legitimate status. The dual-track system not only created a structure of sep-
aration in economy, but also provided a system guarantee for the effective con-
nection between the stocks and the increments. On the one hand, the state-owned
sector, which was the basis of the planned economy, still adopted administrative
means to implement mandatory pricing, centralized allocation of resources and the
system of graded wages. On the other hand, the emerging non-state sector began to
explore market-oriented mechanisms in production, sales, pricing and wages.
Especially in the expansion from agricultural accumulation to industrial accumu-
lation, from transactions of agricultural products to transactions of industrial
products, this advantage became more evident.
The reality shows that the two ends of the dual track were not “secure in their
own places without any communication in-between.” In fact, in the initial stage of
rural industrialization, the township enterprises launched a challenge against the
“shortage economy” by very simple techniques and handicraft-style workshop
production, and quickly created a situation of “encircling the cities from the
countryside” relying on the production of primary products. Later, the township
enterprises seized the opportunity of the state-owned enterprises’ contracting reform
under the guideline of “decentralization of power and transfer of proﬁts,” and took
advantage of the insufﬁcient principal-agent relationship between the state-owned
enterprises and their subordinate collective enterprises, to carry out all-round
under-cover dealings with the state-owned enterprises on a large scale. Here are
their speciﬁc approaches. First of all, the township enterprises acquired large
amounts of means of production priced only by state mandates from the state-own
enterprises, taking advantage of the dual price system, and transferred proﬁts in the
form of commissions. Secondly, the township enterprises also grabbed the

opportunities created by the state-owned enterprises’ loss of ﬁxed assets to acquire
machinery, equipment and production techniques at very low costs, and quickly
improved their own technical competitiveness. In addition, the township enterprises
also poached a large number of technical personnel and management talents from
the state-owned enterprises by adopting market-oriented wage standards and paying
high salaries. Furthermore, the township enterprises also directly signed out-
sourcing business contacts with the state-owned enterprises in relevant areas of
production. The state-owned enterprises directly gave contract awards to the
township enterprises for manufacturing primary products. In many places, the
township enterprises even adopted a more direct approach. They held shares in or
formed partnership with the state-owned enterprises’ “secondary-property-rights
danwei” (collective enterprises), and engaged directly in market operations as
parasites in the state-owned enterprises.22
It can be said that the dual-track system in regime governance gave all-round
comparative advantages to the township enterprises. The township enterprises’
development experiences tell us, if there had not been the system stocks, or the
embedded relationship between the stocks and the increments, the township
enterprises would have lacked system resources. Although such system resources
were not allocated in the way of the redistribution system, various ﬂexible tactics
and measures in the incremental reform, as well as thinking free from the restraints
of the stock system, provided enormous space for the township enterprises to
maximally
utilize
the
stock
system
resources
and
to
transform
such
system-controlled resources into free-ﬂowing resources. In fact, the township
enterprises and their directors needed to attach themselves to “higher grounds,” to
establish relationships with regional, cross-regional, even central administrative
agencies, in order to bring the advantage of institutional embedding into play. They
needed to form all-round patronage relationships, openly or undercover, with
state-owned enterprises at a higher administrative level in a wide range of areas,
including production, equipment, techniques, sales, proﬁt-sharing, and capital
operation, etc., in order to continually expand their business capacities and establish
their irreplaceability, and to seek opportunities to turn their management rights into
ownership rights.
In the governance logic of “the dual-track system,” the incremental part of the
reform actually enjoyed greater protection. Neither the township enterprises’ ﬂex-
ible approaches of internal governance and exclusivity towards the exterior, nor
their transactional relationship, open or undercover, with the external system,
especially with the state-owned enterprises, would get punished under the general
political background of “ﬁxing farm output quotas for each household,” because at
that time the contract system was the biggest guarantee of legitimacy in social
economic operation. Even inside the stock system, the possibility of the contracting
reform was also being considered. In the mean time, “the dual-track system” also
prepared the institutional foundation for the local governments’ protection of the

township enterprises. The township enterprises, as legitimate “test ﬁelds” of the
reform, was not governed and controlled by the vertical overall system, like
organizations under the danwei system. They were “enclaves” under the heavy
protection of the local governments, relatively free from the intervention of such
system elements as the Party, the Youth League, or “Work, Youth and Women,”
etc. In this sense, they resembled small independent kingdoms.
It should be pointed out that such local protection had deeper causes in the
governance system. Their explanation should begin with adjustments and changes
in the ﬁscal relationship between the central government and local governments. In
the mid-1980s, in order to break the system bottleneck of administrative inter-
vention in the economy, the central government began to make indirect adjustments
in the local economies through a package of economic policies including ﬁscal, tax
and ﬁnancial policies, to expand the local governments’ freedom and authority in
economic management and operation. This is called the “ﬁnancial contract system”
reform. In essence, “bao gan” (be responsible for a task until it is completed) is the
same as “cheng bao” (contracting). The so-call “cai zheng bao gan” (the ﬁnancial
contract system) refers to the arrangement where the central government adopts a
contract system based on the “ﬁxed base ﬁgure” in regard to the ﬁscal revenue of
the local governments. The part of revenue within the ﬁxed base ﬁgure would be
divided between the central and local governments according to predetermined
proportions, while the part of revenue exceeding the ﬁxed base ﬁgure would largely
be left at the disposal of the local governments. The ﬁxed base ﬁgure and the
proportion of revenue division between the central and local governments varied
from province to province, and depended on the negotiations between the central
and provincial governments.23 Although such a ﬁscal system of “Fixed Rent” went
though partial adjustments, it lasted till the year of 1994. The ten years of imple-
menting “the ﬁnancial contract system” coincided with the township enterprises’
cycle of rise and fall.
4.2.4
The Discourse of the Contract System
The above analysis on regime governance indicates that the rise of the township
enterprises did not solely rely on the spontaneous motivation of the grassroots
society, but to a greater extent relied on institutional motivation. Fundamentally
speaking, such institutional motivation was not limited to local government
incentives provided by the ﬁnancial contract system. More importantly, it means
that the township enterprises’ development history embodied the basic line of
reform in the 1980s.
23Economists refer to this ﬁscal system as “ﬁscal federalism.” See Qian and Weingast (1997,
pp. . 83–92), Qian and Roland (1998, pp. 1143–1162). About the impact of ﬁscal decentralization
on local government behaviors, see Zhang (2006).

Although the reform of the contract system was carried out step by step and had
the characteristics of a progressive reform, judging from the statistics of two rapid
expansions of the township enterprises, the process of policy propulsion in the
reform was nothing short of a political movement. In 1984, with the promulgation
and implementation of “No. 1 central document” and “No. 4 central document,”
township enterprises blossomed everywhere, which included household enterprises,
joint-households enterprises, and village collective enterprises. In 1984, the number
of township enterprises jumped from 1.3464 million of the previous year to 6.0652
million. In May 1984, the peasants in Zhejiang Province alone raised 140 million
yuan and set up more than 20,000 township enterprises. In 1992, under the inﬂu-
ence of Deng Xiaoping’s talks in Southern China, the total economic output,
production scale and economic efﬁciency of the township enterprises gained rapid
growth. In 1992, the operating income of the township enterprises increased by
48.82% from 1991, the ﬁxed assets increased by 28.11%, the current assets
increased by 29.27% and taxes increased by 44.39%. In 1993, these ﬁgures took
another big step forward. The township enterprises’ operating income, ﬁxed assets,
current assets and taxes increased respectively by 82.88, 57.66, 84.08 and 74.88%
from 1992.24 Such a trend of development of township enterprises was clearly not a
spontaneous economic development trajectory, but had the color of political cam-
paigns. The situation of “big and small factories like stars ﬁlling up the sky” and
“eliminate administrative villages without factories” became common phenomena
in many areas.25 As township enterprises blossomed everywhere in a short time,
due to their characteristics of multiple forms, multiple levels, multiple categories,
multiple channels of business operation and their independent, cooperative, or
collective management forms, the ownership relations of the township enterprises
were extremely complex, fuzzy, and chaotic.26 Whether the contractors, the village
collective leaderships or the local governments, all driven and urged by the wave of
24See Shang and Liu (2001).
25See the news article “From ‘smoke rising up in every village’ to ‘concentration in linked areas’: a
survey of the industrial zone in Tongzha Town of Hanshan County in Anhui.” The article says, “In
the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the guidance of ‘eliminating the administrative villages
without factories,’ Tongzha Town launched a vigorous campaign of setting up township enter-
prises. In addition to the original 20 township enterprises, the 17 administrative villages set up a
total number of 39 enterprises, including annular kiln plants, grain and oil processing plants, lime
kiln plants, quarries, small compound chemical fertilizer plants, etc. However, these village
enterprises did not last long. By the mid-1990s, except a few grain and oil plants, which were still
running and processed grain and oil for the local peasants, the other enterprises had all closed
doors, or stopped production. As a result, these villages not only destroyed large areas of farmland,
but also incurred heavy debts, each of the 17 administrative villages running into debts ranging
from tens of thousands yuan to hundreds of thousands yuan.” Retrieved from http://news.sina.com.

26Dai Muzhen pointed out that in the process of market-oriented transformation, “the upward ﬂow
of information brought about by the mass line did not originate from the bottom-up efforts of the
peasants, but was under the top-down control of the state like the opening or closing of valves.”

reform, they were all willing to adopt the principles of “shelving the issue of
ownership” and “business operation coming ﬁrst” to quickly expand market
territories.
In fact, in the governance structure within the township enterprises, the rela-
tionship between ownership and operation also fully demonstrated the character-
istics of a dual-track system. The whole set of discourse system for the contract
system regarded the composite ownership relations of the township enterprises, a
mixture of the state, the collective, the family and the individuals, as the stock, to be
maintained but not to be argued about. Following the principle of “no argument,
only work,” the township enterprises strove to blindly expand their business
operations and operational space. Similarly, the local governments also upheld the
“no argument” principle, and regarded performance as the only yardstick of
legitimacy.27 In this sense, “cheng bao” (contracting) and “jing ying” (operation) in
“cheng bao jing ying” (operation under contract) belong to the same category of
discourse. “Contracting” means that all arguments concerning ownership should be
put on hold, and all the ownership rights should be transferred to a business entity
within the contract period, the ownership relations should remain fuzzy, the man-
agement relations should be clariﬁed, debates on ownership should be bypassed,
and “catch the mouse” as a principle of efﬁciency should be given the foremost
importance. Whether it is called “bao chan” (make a production contract) or “bao
gan” (contract responsibility), or the so-called “zi zhu jing ying, zi fu ying kui” (have
full authority for operation, assume sole responsibility for one’s own proﬁts or
losses), they all placed the operator (manager) in the position of the primary subject,
and used the mechanism of performance to unify the reform discourse. The Chinese
character “bao” (wrap up), established the knowledge base for the governance
mechanism of the 1980s.28 In the household contract responsibility system, “bao
chan dao hu” (ﬁx farm output quotas for each household) and “bao gan dao hu”
27Deng Xiaoping said in the Southern talks in 1992, “Don’t engage in argument. This is a
invention of mine. Save time for doing real things. If people start arguing, things will become
complex, time will be wasted, and nothing will get accomplished. So don’t argue, try bold
experiments and blaze new trails. This applies to the rural reform, as well as the city reform.” See
Deng (1993, p. 374).
28In a study on “Xiaogang Village,” a typical example of the contract system reform, Li Jie pointed
out that the “Xiaogang story” functioned as a promoter and bridge in the transformation of the
fundamental discourse structure of the country. The shaping process of this typical example is also
the process of discourse construction for the transformation of the state governance system.
Xiaogang Village, as a symbol of state governance, has a symbolic value far greater than the
incident itself in China’s social transformation. It marks the state’s reshaping of governance
discourse and image in the implementation of the household contract responsibility system. That
is, through converting the survival ethics of the peasants into their own governance symbol, the
state successfully completed the signiﬁcant transformation of its discourse logic. On the one hand,
the brief highlighting of survival ethics gave incentives to the peasants, as producers bearing the
will of the country, to devote themselves into the production process with greater enthusiasm, so as
to create a sustained and stable source of revenue for the country. On the other hand, the success of
rural reform laid a good basis of legitimacy for the promotion of further market transformation. See
Li (2009).

(work contracted to households), meant that in land management, the collective
ownership of land should be shelved, each farm household should be converted into
a business entity. “Give enough to the country, leave enough for the collective, all
the rest are their own.”29 The reform of the contract system in the agricultural front
provided the discourse foundation for the subsequent implementation of the con-
tract responsibility system in the township enterprises, and planted the seeds for the
“collective ownership problems” which appeared in the transformation process later
on. From a technical point of view, Liu Shiding discussed in detail the constraint
mechanism of the contract system. The constraint on the director (manager) initially
took the form of target constraints which was called “one swift kick,” that is, the
contractor was required only to turn over a certain amount of proﬁts to the gov-
ernment, all other things being ignored. If this single requirement was not fulﬁlled,
the director would be dismissed with a swift kick. Not until the middle and late
1980s, did people gradually adopt the approach of process constraint, and started to
enact binding regulations on employment mode, salary system and disposal of
assets, etc.30
In the ﬁrst ten years of reform, “bao” was the logic yardstick dominating the
system reforms in almost all areas. “Bao” means that what originally belonged to
others is now at your disposal, and your performance in business operation is the
only thing that matters. In this agential relationship, there was not even a clear and
deﬁnite principal. Later happenings seemed to indicate that the principal could be
redeﬁned according to the effect of management, which foreshadowed the secret
modiﬁcation of ownership in later times. Because “bao” shifted the focus of all
social operations from ownership rights to operation rights, and ﬁscal decentral-
ization provided effective stimulation and protection, in concrete business opera-
tion, the contractors and the local governments were liberated from all kinds of
system constraints, and could use all means to mobilize all resources, even by
resorting to extreme measures.
In the mean time, “bao” could also temporarily shelve the problems of “surplus
right” and “right of recourse” in ownership relations, and wait for solutions in the
future. The phenomenon of “no initial contract” mentioned in She Xiaoye’s studies
was actually a common phenomenon in the reform of the contract system. This was
determined by the unique intrinsic logic of the contract system. While drawing
distinctions between several types of contract systems in southern Jiangsu, Liu
Shiding pointed out a common feature of all types of contracting, which goes as
follows. “The government did not make requirements on the director about what to
produce, how to organize production, or to whom the products should be sold. The
directors had full authority over all these important decisions.”31 It can be said that,
29Wu Jinglian pointed out that by the beginning of 1983, more than 90% of the production teams
nationwide had implemented either “bao chan dao hu” or “bao gan dao hu,” thus eventually
establishing the new system in China where the peasants set up their own family farms on the
contracted (“bao”) land that belonged to the collective. See Jinglian and Huang (2008a).

under the protection of the dual-track system, the Chinese character “bao,” quickly
opened up a free space for the township enterprises and local governments to
exercise their rights, and at the same time, opened up space for the free ﬂow of
resources, and space for free market competition. Although the township govern-
ments often unilaterally modiﬁed the contracts, adjusted the targets, and asked the
contractors to comply, the two sides still to a great extent had good rapport and tacit
mutual understanding, and formed a consensus on pursuing economic efﬁciency. In
the development of township enterprises, a more widespread phenomenon was
“administration runs the whole show.” The local governments quickly set up large
numbers of township enterprises as if in a competition, which was quite reminiscent
of the “political tournaments.”32 The principles of effectiveness, efﬁciency and
effects have undoubtedly shaped the governance principle centering on performance
legitimacy since the beginning of reform.33
4.2.5
The Revival of Family and Clanship
However, in the study of the relationship between possession, operation and gov-
ernance of the township enterprises, we must fully consider the factor of social
mores. Although the study of regime governance and its knowledge forms can
reveal the whole society’s structural conditions, institutional environment, operat-
ing mechanisms and the people’s thinking patterns, it cannot replace the differential
inﬂuences of different geographical backgrounds, customs and local knowledge in
different regions.
The township enterprises are indigenous in nature. But the theoretical signiﬁ-
cance of such an indigenous nature does not only rest on the township enterprises’
local experience, but also, and even more, on its overall value for the transformation
of civilization.34 The “rural economy as a mixture of agriculture and industry” was
still a kind of continuation of the rural industrial tradition proposed by Fei Xiaotong
in his Peasant Life in China. It was in fact a challenge against the so-called
integrated production mode of the modern industrial society. However, whether it is
family industry or township enterprises, they both need the capacity to accom-
modate the traditional social resources, so as to avoid being squeezed by a unitary
authoritarian system or capital coercion, so that they can effectively integrate
32In the development of township enterprises, the phenomenon of “administration running the
whole show” was quite serious. A considerable part of the township governments launched
projects blindly without adequate project evaluation and justiﬁcation in advance, just in order to
complete the task, or save face. Many township governments, under the push of administrative
forces, spent great efforts to get their projects approved and obtain funds, but the projects even-
tually failed and became a burden. Because of this, the township governments were later faced
with the serious danger of running into heavy debts. See Cheng (2009).

34See Gan (1994).

various “informal” institutional elements to survive and keep on innovating. In this
sense, the reform and opening up, the household contract responsibility system
which was ﬁrst implemented, and the dual-track system in regime governance,
happened to provide the space for the revival of traditional social resources. To give
prominence to the economic unit of the “household” in the contract system was
actually a revision of the earlier revolutionary theories. Here, instead of saying the
families were liberated, I would rather say China’s contemporary revolutionary
history was reintegrated into the social foundation of historical traditions. The
foundation of the rural society was no longer the nationalized or collectivized
People’s Communes, or the enforced cooperative economy, but a combination of
administrative village organizations (in some areas the administrative villages are
the same with the natural villages) and family or clan organizations.
The policy effect of “work contracted to households” or “distribution of farmland
to households” was not only shown in agricultural production efﬁciency, but also in
the reorganization of rural society. The development of the vast rural areas as
reform increments was not only reﬂected in the rapid economic growth, but also
reﬂected in the double resurrection of the family organization and the village
organization. On the one hand, although the household contract responsibility
system was implemented with the nuclear family as the basic economic unit, with
the appearance of agricultural products transactions and industrialized production,
the trend of family network diffusion became increasingly evident. The reviving
clanship became an important channel for building social and economic ties, and an
important medium for production, exchange, and ﬁnancing. What followed was that
all kinds of traditions, festivals, rituals, clan disciplines and even folk religions were
also restored and revived, reestablishing the ethic and belief order in the rural
areas.35 On the other hand, with the growth of the collective economic strength and
the establishment of the folk social order, local elites began to emerge in large
numbers in villages and towns. The elite groups in government administration and
in economy also fulﬁlled many important functions in rural community life, with
the new elites replacing, or converted from, the old.36
The revival of clanship and the reorganization of villages went hand in hand,
with the township enterprises being an important intermediate link between them.
Lin Nan’s study on Daqiuzhuang village in Tianjin indicates that in the process of
the local elites’ conversion from agriculture to industry, the rise of rural local
markets, as well as the geopolitical characteristics of township enterprise clusters,
provided opportunities for the network-oriented transformation of the power
structure of rural governance. In this transformation, family relationships were the
primary resource for building such relationship networks.37 Indeed, family, or
clanship, is the foremost mechanism of mores governance that has a cohesive effect
in the Chinese society. However, the role of family and clanship in the construction

of the modern society is different from their traditional role. After decades of
transformation under the socialist system, the family organization and clan orga-
nization must seek path dependence on the system, must ﬁnd an approach that can
fully integrate themselves with the collective system, and play their role in social
reorganization in accordance with the speciﬁc circumstances under real changes.
Therefore, in different regions, different institutional and cultural environments, the
family relationships that were activated and could be utilized were also different.
Different family relationships, as well as their different ways of combination with
conditions of industrialization, marketization and capitalization, resulted in different
models of township enterprises.
When we examine the mechanisms of growth, operation and evolution of the
township enterprises and their impact on the social and collective relationships from
the perspective of governance, we can ﬁnd that the family and the relevant customs
and norms played an extremely important pivotal role within the scope permitted by
regime governance. Moreover, under appropriate institutional and social mores
conditions, they could become the dominant mechanism in enterprise organization
and grassroots social organization. However, under what appropriate conditions
could this happen? We have to pay attention to the speciﬁc meanings of ownership
and management relations in different regions, as well as to the different ways in
which customs and social mores were embedded in the system, especially to the
forms of social evolution of family and clan relationships.
While talking about the different characteristics of the “Wenzhou model” and the
“southern Jiangsu model,” Fei Xiaotong once humorously said, “the historical
tradition of southern Jiangsu is ‘agriculture and industry complement each other,’
and ‘the men plough and the women weave,’ which can be portrayed with the
Chinese idiom ‘nan geng nü zhi’ (the cowherd and the weaving maid). However,
the historical tradition of Wenzhou is like ‘ba xian guo hai’ (the eight immortals
crossing the sea), where all sorts of craftsmen, engaging in stone carving, bamboo
weaving, cotton ﬂufﬁng, barrel hooping, tailoring, hairdressing, cooking etc., and
peddlers of sugar or small articles for daily use travelled far and wide, earned
money, and brought the earnings back to raise their families and establish them-
selves in business.”38 Fei Xiaotong made this remark to remind us that in the
process of the second industrialization in the 1980s, different regions had different
ways of integrating traditional customs with enterprise governance. If we are to
examine the different models of township enterprises, we must also start from the
different regions’ land ownership systems, forms of traditional industries, marriage
forms, population movements and ways of circulating goods, so as to reveal the
characteristics of the whole structure through type analysis. Fei Xiaotong went on to
say: “On these two different foundations, in southern Jiangsu sprang out the
commune and brigade industry followed by the rise of township industry, in
southern Zhejiang sprang out the household industry and markets of specialized
processing. In southern Jiangsu, industry grew out of agriculture and its sidelines,
38Fei (1999. p. 456).
4.2
Township Enterprises: The Labor Relations Under the Collective System
103

industry served as a complement of agriculture. While in southern Zhejiang,
industry grew out of commerce and peddling, and served to expand commerce.”39
To summarize the difference between the two models, in the growth environment of
the township enterprises in southern Jiangsu, the contradiction between “industry”
and “agriculture” needed to be solved. While in Wenzhou and other areas of
southern Zhejiang, the contradiction between “industry” and “commerce” was
highlighted for governance.
In these two different social structures, family relations also had different
characteristics. Because the families of southern Jiangsu adhered ﬁrmly to the land,
it was easy to establish community solidarity of the native soil through the network
structure of kinship relations, which exhibited strong features of collective and
common ownership. In southern Jiangsu, blood relations combined with geo-
graphical relations; the family, the collective and the local administrative system
were integrated into one. Under different system conditions, these three logics could
be combined, or have mutual constraints, or become the dominant mechanism one
after another. For example, in the time of “Peasant Life in China,” family was a
dominant social relationship in the process of industrialization. During the period of
establishment of cooperatives, the characteristics of the collective economy were
obvious. And when the rule of the overall system was strengthened, administration
became the decisive mechanism. The example of Huaxi Village shows that when
the decentralization system opened a certain amount of space, the administrative
authority could also change in the direction of patriarchy.
In comparison, the traditional family structure of southern Zhejiang had very
different characteristics. In Fei Xiaotong’s words, “these craftsmen and peddlers
who kept wandering in strange lands got married with peasant girls who tilled
farmlands near their homes; such marriages are the union of craftsmanship, com-
merce and agriculture.” Such a type of family structure was not unstable, but was
ﬂuid and diffused, the members were separated much longer than they were
reunited. Its corresponding industrial forms had strong characteristics of individual
economy, and were very suitable for using the employment system in production
organization. In the early stage of the township enterprises’ development, Wenzhou
produced many enterprises with large-scale employment and many successful
self-employed businessmen. However, in the circulation of goods and movement of
population, in order to provide support and protection for each other, people from
this region were more likely to resort to the advantages of family relations and
clanship relations, and establish huge kinship networks free from geographical
constraints and set up pan-family cultural systems.40 In the rural areas of Wenzhou,
people widely used ancestral halls, genealogies, clan regulations and disciplines and
other traditional customs to give full play to clanship in the mobilization, organi-
zation and coordination of social resources. Its effect on social unity far exceeded
39Ibid.
40Zhang (2008, pp. 77–81).

that of northern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu.41 In southern Jiangsu, nearly a
hundred years of rural industrialization had all along centered around the agricul-
tural delineations of the region, and continuously produced the effect of consoli-
dating the original social structure. In contrast, the industrialization of Wenzhou
took a different route. Their commercial networks spread all over China, even all
over the world. Where their clan relations could be found, their business activities
could also be found. Moreover, since this kind of kinship ties were extremely
cohesive, closed and exclusive, comparatively speaking, they were not prone to
become dependent on the governance system and were not easily affected by
political movements.
Due to intense institutionalization in southern Jiangsu, the society’s inclination
for upward mobility along the vertical system was very strong. For generations
people in this region devoted themselves to running ofﬁcial schools and seeking
ofﬁcialdom. In this region, the institutional resources were relatively concentrated;
the planning right, organization right and coordination right in administration were
also relatively concentrated; the support and protection of grassroots production
activities mostly came from the governance system. As to the local elites, especially
those entrepreneurs of the township enterprises who owed their success to reform
policies, in order to obtain social recognition and seek resources, they must not only
depend on economic operation, but also rely on political operation. A large part of
these local elites sought political status through becoming representatives of the
people’s congresses, or members of the CPPCC, etc. In this sense, the local gov-
ernment’s in-depth intervention in and control of the township enterprises also had
its legitimacy as a matter of course. Therefore, it is not difﬁcult for us to understand
the widespread phenomenon of “corporate government” in this region, and the
integration of the township governments’ administrative structure and the township
enterprises’ management structure into one, a phenomenon described by Liu
Shiding.42 Besides, it is not difﬁcult for us to understand why some enterprises
which actually developed on the basis of families should call themselves “collective
enterprises” (or “wear the red hat”) to protect themselves. In short, the reason why
these phenomena occurred was not determined by the muddled ownership relations,
but because a lot of factors of regime governance and mores governance were
mixed together.
In comparison, because people in Wenzhou were more dependent on the family
networks and clanship networks, they had very strong horizontal mobility.43 The
enterprises’ business activities of production, sales, circulation and ﬁnancing often
had a certain degree of secrecy, and were often completed in the “gray zone” of the
so-called informal institutions. We ﬁnd that such family ties were not only extre-
mely strong, but also very ﬂexible, they could be condensed into an individual

family business, they could also be expanded into an enormous pan-family net-
work. Transactions, trust, capital ﬂows and loans could reach everywhere through
this network which extended in all directions, and could keep refreshing themselves
in cycles, and at the same time could form a social protection system with mutual
dependence and mutual support. “He hui” (mutual loan club), a type of
non-governmental organization which was very popular in Wenzhou, or other
similar organizations like “qian hui,” “yao hui,” “cheng hui,” etc., and their
members had to comply with strict club rules and moral restraints, and spare no
efforts to protect their credibility and reputation. The clubs not only provided
support and opportunities for their members in information sharing and cash ﬂow,
but also helped them avoid various business risks through mutual assistance.44
These forms of the common ownership were not unique to this region. There are
more or less similarities between the Wenzhou family networks and Weber’s
“Protestant Sects.” The Wenzhou family networks also bore some resemblance to
the “qian zhuang” (money house) in Shanxi and the “shang bang” (merchant gang)
in Huizhou in the old times. Although a large number of family enterprises in
Wenzhou were embedded in family networks, they did not exist in total disregard of
the state system. The phenomenon of “wearing the red hat” was also widespread in
this region, but its mechanism and characteristics were completely different from
southern Jiangsu. The so-called “afﬁliate operation”45 in Wenzhou refers to the
practice that a family business only needed to pay a certain amount of fee to become
an afﬁliate to a collective enterprise, and engage in economic activities in the name
of collective economy. In fact, the private or family enterprise still implemented
autonomous operation, and assumed sole responsibility for their own proﬁts or
losses. This type of legalization and self-protection was only nominal, and did not
have a substantial connection with the collective or the system.
In fact, in terms of possession and operation, the different governance mecha-
nisms introduced above had impacts in different directions. For example, in rela-
tions of possession, several tiers of ownership often co-existed and coincided for the
same enterprises in southern Jiangsu, while in the southern Zhejiang region, the
ownership structure more often exhibited a network layout based on clanship
relations or pan-kinship relations. In business operation, the township enterprises in
southern Jiangsu were easily subject to the domination of the local governments.
They depended on “government credit” when obtaining loans from the bank, they
obtained the community land resources for free or at very low cost. It was easy for
these enterprises to form an operation pattern that relied on the system resources
and that served as complement to the urban economy. In addition, the government’s
strong intervention also provided favorable conditions for the enterprises to expand
their scales, and to optimize and upgrade their industrial layout. In contrast, the
township enterprises in Wenzhou had the non-agricultural characteristic from the
beginning. Family workshops scattered all over like stars in the sky, and engaged in

processing and production of small commodities in the form of partnership system,
cooperative system or simulated joint-stock cooperative system. Relying on their
huge market and capital network they expanded their business rapidly, carried out
closed-off management without much intervention from the outside government. In
fact, during the enterprise restructuring aimed at marketization and corporatization
in the 1990s, because southern Jiangsu had complicated and confused ownership
relations, and its management relations were also deeply inﬂuenced by the state
system, many cases of “insider control” or “black box operation” took place. Many
system-based entrepreneurs used enterprise restructuring as a platform to integrate a
variety of resources, and achieved rapid accumulation of capital, resulting in
enterprises of larger scales and a class of entrepreneurs with more concentrated
resources. In contrast, the enterprises in Wenzhou were more transparent. Some
enterprises adopted the approach of “competitive bidding” to implement system
transformation; some enterprises that were run under “afﬁliate operation” but were
actually privately owned discarded their disguise and ofﬁcially put up the sign of
private enterprise.46 During this period, local chambers of commerce and business
associations which were set up by indigenous entrepreneurs, as well as those hidden
underground clubs, played an important role for the consolidation and conversion
of various resources in system transformation.

State-Owned Enterprises: Labor Relations Under
the Contract System
From the late 1970s, the discourse of contracting became the dominant discourse
guiding the waves of reform at all levels. From the household contract responsi-
bility system implemented throughout the vast countryside, to the contract system
reform of the commune and brigade enterprises, to the director’s (manager’s)
contracted managerial responsibility system implemented in the decentralization of
power and transfer of proﬁts in state-owned enterprises, to the ﬁnancial contract
system that implement level-by-level subcontracting from the top to the bottom,47
even to the implementation of the strategy of Special Economic Zones, all these
reforms were dominated by the discourse of contracting. Among these, the contract
system reform of the state-owned enterprises had far-reaching impact in the fol-
lowing 20 years. It had impact not only on the direction of state-owned enterprise
46Zhang Jianjun made a detailed analysis of the restructuring processes and differences in the
restructuring mechanisms of the two areas from the three dimensions of ﬁscal constraints,
supervision constraints and information constraints.
47The embryonic form of the ﬁscal contracting system had come into being since 1980. At that
time, the central government and 15 provinces had implemented the ﬁscal system of “division of
revenue and expenditure, multi-level contract responsibilities.” By 1985, the system had been
further improved and popularized. Its main features were “classiﬁcation of tax categories, veriﬁ-
cation of revenues and expenditures, multi-level contract responsibilities”.

restructuring, but also on the workers’ identity change and adjustment of labor
relations in the state-owned enterprises, as well as on the future evolution of the
state governance system.
4.3.1
The Contract System Reform of the State-Owned
Enterprises
In this part, the analytic tools of possession, operation and governance will be used
to examine the general characteristics of the labor relations in state-owned enter-
prises from the late 1970s to the late 1990s.
The political connotation of the contract system reform is very obvious. The
political meaning of the dual-track system is reﬂected in the following under-
standing. The conventional governance of the stock system alone could not
effectively achieve the reform goals. Only through expanding the increments could
the reform break the bondage of the stock system, and ﬁnd the direction of the
system reform. To carry on the reform, people should “cross the river by feeling the
stones,” that is, they needed to be both careful and bold. Firstly, people should
“emancipate their mind” and explore boldly in increments, in order to gradually
decide the new direction of political governance. By putting aside the question of
“xing zi xing she” (whether the road is capitalist or socialist), people could try
different ways and see for themselves which development path was more effective,
so that they could have the opportunity to further establish the political legitimacy
of the system reform. Deng Xiaoping once said, “Our reform and opening up began
from the economic ﬁeld, began from the rural areas… … the success of reform in
the rural areas added to our conﬁdence, our rural reform experiences could also be
used in urban reform, and we carried out the comprehensive economic system
reform which was centered on the cities.”48 As to the question whether we should
replace such policies as the rural household contract responsibility system, Deng
Xiaoping said, “I say we cannot,” because “if we replace it, people will say that the
policy has changed. The game is not worth the candle.”49
48See Deng Xiaoping’s remarks in a meeting with Stefan Korosec, member of the Presidium of the
Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in June 1987. See Deng (1993,
p. 164).
49See Deng (1993, p. 371). In January 1983, the central government issued “A number of issues
concerning the current rural economic policy,” which pointed out that since The Third Plenary
Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, China’s rural areas
had undergone many signiﬁcant changes. Among them, the change with the most far-reaching
impact had been the widespread implementation of various forms of agricultural production
responsibility system, and the household contract responsibility system had increasingly become
the main form. The household contract responsibility system was a great creation of the Chinese
peasants under the leadership of the Party. It was also the new development of the Marxist theory
of agricultural cooperation in China. In the same month, Deng Xiaoping said in a meeting with the
leaders of the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission and the agricultural
108

In this regard, the contract system reform was like a political movement that
incorporated a new concept of state governance, and the initial experiments in the
ﬁelds of agriculture and rural industry were a prologue to this system reform.
However, the beginning of this political movement followed the principle of the
dual-track system. Unlike the previous political movements, in which full mobi-
lization and full participation of the masses were realized through the arbitrary
power and will of an individual or the centralized system,50 this reform started off
from the periphery rather than the center, from outside the system rather than from
within the system. Between the interior and exterior of the system, it established a
mechanism of change that was gradual, progressive, and that had breakthroughs
and counterbalances, stimulus and response. Speciﬁcally, the successful experience
of the contract responsibility system in agriculture was applied to the industrial-
ization reform of the township enterprises, the contract system reform of the rural
industry in turn was extended to the contract system reform of the state-owned
enterprises, and then the reform was further expanded into the scope of adminis-
trative system reform (the ﬁnancial contract system changed the original unidi-
rectional governance relationship between the central and local governments).
Finally several special economic zones were set up, where another set of systems
were introduced to implement the will of reform.51 At each critical node of the
contract system reform, “the incremental side” carried out institutional innovations
in the periphery of the system, triggering off intense stimulus on the corresponding
part of “the stock side.” On the other hand it had to rely on the corresponding part
of “the stock side” for access to resources, and gain competitive advantages through
marketization.
The reform of China’s state-owned enterprises actually began no later than the
rural reform. In fact, before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
departments, “I agree with implementing ‘large-scale contract farmers’. We have not done enough
to liberate our mind. There are many breakthroughs to make in agriculture, we have not started
yet”.
50See Zhou (2012).
51Yang Xiaokai believes that the special economic zones in fact were direct imitation of the export
processing zones and free trade zones in Taiwan and some capitalist countries. See Yang (2011).

Committee of the CPC, the reform of state-owned enterprises had already begun in
Sichuan Province.52 The reform of state-owned enterprises was the sally port of the
central government’s comprehensive economic system reform. It was also the
government’s initial attempt to gradually overcome the drawbacks of the original
planned economic model through decentralization.53 In the early years of the
reform and opening-up, the reform of the state-owned enterprises was aimed at
overcoming the long-standing problems of “no separation of government and
enterprises,” “low efﬁciency,” “superﬂuous staff,” “lack of ﬂexibility and
52In October 1978, after obtaining the approval of the State Council, Sichuan Province took the
lead in implementing the reform of “giving greater autonomy to the enterprises,” launching pilot
projects in Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and other six local state-owned enterprises. The
main contents of the reform were the following: appraise and ﬁx the proﬁt target of each enterprise;
set the targets of increase in production and income; allow the enterprises to keep a small amount
of proﬁts as corporate fund after the completion of the annual plan at the end of the year; allow the
enterprises to give out small amounts of bonus to the workers; allow the enterprises to engage in
production beyond the state’s mandatory plans; allow export enterprises to have some foreign
exchange earnings at their own disposal. In January 1979, Sichuan Province increased the number
of pilot enterprises from 6 to 100, and at the same time carried out experiments on the expansion of
management autonomy in the state-owned commercial enterprises. In the same year, the Capital
Iron and Steel Company also joined the pilot program, which was a landmark event in the reform.
See Zheng (2008, pp. 30–31).
53In 1957, after China’s socialist transformation, the system of planned economy was basically
established; almost all enterprises became state-owned enterprises, private enterprises and other
forms of ownership no longer existed. Under this system, all enterprises were incorporated into the
highly centralized planning system of the state. The enterprise’s personnel rights, management
rights, distribution rights, as well as various types of beneﬁts and welfare for the workers, were all
appointed, allocated and regulated by the state in accordance with uniﬁed standards. The enterprise
became a subsidiary organization with no independent rights, no independent interests and no
independent responsibility; or, more precisely, the enterprise became a subordinate administrative
organization that completed mandatory tasks and met operational objectives under the govern-
ment’s arrangement. In management system, the state adopted the approach of “uniﬁed leadership,
hierarchical management” towards the enterprises. The state-owned enterprises were basically
divided into two categories, those directly under central management and those under the joint
management of central and local authorities, of which the enterprises directly under central
management accounted for half of the total industrial output value. In planned allocation, almost
all of the business activities of the enterprise were speciﬁed by state plans. Each year the gov-
ernment departments in charge would issue planned targets in output value, production output,
products, technology, funds, labor productivity, total wages, average wage and so on, and the
enterprises should timely ﬁll out more than 40 kinds of forms for reporting statistics to the higher
authorities. In investment management, the state strictly examined and approved the investment
projects, and the enterprises had no investment decision-making power. In ﬁnancial management,
the state implemented “uniﬁed state control over income and expenditure.” The funds needed by
the enterprise were all allocated free of charge by the central government or the local government
in full accordance with the relationships of afﬁliation. The state ﬁnancial departments and
departments directly in charge of the state-owned enterprise would appraise and ﬁx the liquidity
plan of the enterprise, and in turn the enterprise would turn over all the depreciation funds and the
majority of the proﬁts to the central and local governments in accordance with the relationship of
afﬁliation. In circulation of products, the state exercised “state monopoly of the purchase and
marketing of enterprise products and raw materials” to implement uniﬁed management of distri-
bution and pricing.

liveliness.” In particular, in 1979 and 1984, the State Council issued twice the
regulations on the expansion of decision-making power in operation and manage-
ment of state-owned enterprises. The ﬁrst wave of decentralization for the
state-owned enterprises was started with changes in ten aspects, i.e., planning for
production and management, product sales, product pricing, materials purchasing,
use of monetary funds, asset disposal, organizational structure, personnel man-
agement, wage and bonus management, rights of joint management.
In the 1980s, the enterprise reform went through three major steps, “fang quan”
(decentralization), “bao gan” (contract responsibility), and “cheng bao” (contract-
ing). The reform that was centered on “the expansion of the enterprises’ autonomy
in business management” was an attempt at solving the predicament of the enter-
prises under the planning system. This reform was unfolded in two directions.
Firstly, through the gradual separation of business operation and mandatory plan-
ning, it aimed to expand the enterprises’ autonomy and improve their production
efﬁciency. Secondly, by changing the internal distribution system of the enterprises,
speciﬁcally, through proﬁt sharing in accordance with the principle of “more pay
for more work,” it aimed at changing the enterprises’ long standing equalitarian
distribution system under the planning system, so as to give incentives to pro-
duction. It should be noted that, because the reform of state-owned enterprises
adopted a gradual approach, and avoided changing the internal governance struc-
ture and the external system environment, the state-owned enterprises on the whole
still operated in accordance with the planned economy and in the form of the
danwei organization; the welfare function of the enterprises had not fundamentally
changed. Under the state distribution system at that time, the majority of workers
could get more income in the form of bonus if the enterprise adopted contract
management in certain scopes of production, although such an increase was not big,
and a larger part of the proﬁts was transferred away by the enterprise agent through
the ways of the contract system and the collective system. However, statistics
indicates that the average income of workers did have some improvement over
these ten years. In terms of income, this period can generally be said to have
implemented the distribution mechanism of the “dual-track system.”
In 1985, the state began to implement the “dual-track system” for the pricing of
the means of production, allowing the enterprises to arrange on their own for
additional production of products needed by the country’s construction or by the
market if they had completed the planned production. As to the prices, the enter-
prises had the right to set the prices for the additional products of means of pro-
duction after completing the state plan, generally no more than 20% of the total.
Alternatively, the price could also be set through negotiation between the parties of
supply and demand within the stipulated range.54 In the same year, the institutions
of “division of taxes, veriﬁcation of revenue and expenditure, level-by-level con-
tracting” were implemented in the country’s ﬁscal management system. These

Industrial Enterprises,” promulgated on May 10, 1984.
4.3
State-Owned Enterprises: Labor Relations Under the Contract System
111

institutions, together with the “system of overall responsibility by factory director
(manager),” and the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, introduced the state-owned
enterprise reform into a new stage.
Although “fang quan,” “bao gan” and “cheng bao” did not change the own-
ership structure of the state-owned enterprises in terms of ownership relations, the
three forms of reform had different impacts on the ownership relations. The dif-
ference was mainly shown in the different agential relationships in management. In
the document issued by the State Council, “Several Provisions on Increasing the
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises’ Autonomy in Management,” the constraint on
the enterprises’ business operation was only partially relaxed. It stipulated that
“under the precondition of completing the state plan, the enterprises are allowed to
make additional production plans according to their own conditions of fuel, power,
raw materials, and in accordance with the needs of construction and market. The
products of the additional plans will ﬁrst be supplied to the departments of com-
merce, foreign trade, and materials. If these departments do not purchase them, the
enterprise can sell them on its own in accordance with the price range set by the
government, or entrust the sales to the departments of commerce, foreign trade and
materials. If the production capacity of the enterprise has surplus, it can undertake
collaborative tasks, or process imported materials, or accept customers’ materials
for processing.” The framework of a planned economy remained the same. It was
just that the enterprises were given a certain degree of operating ﬂexibility within a
predetermined scope. In the aspect of retaining proﬁts in particular, the document
said, “We implement enterprise proﬁts retaining. The current method of drawing
enterprise fund according to the total wages should be changed. The business
performance of the enterprise should be directly linked to the development of
enterprise production and the material interests of the workers. The proportion of
proﬁts to be retained should be decided in accordance with the speciﬁc circum-
stances of different industries and different enterprises.” Although this reform of
decentralization (fang quan), for the ﬁrst time, gave the enterprises some free space
in the aspects of market exchange, wage distribution and labor employment, it did
not have ﬂexible handling in budget constraint; the typical public ownership
structure did not change.
Later, the enterprise bao gan (contract responsibility) system in fact began to
relax the budget constraint. This situation was very similar to the ﬁnancial contract
system between the central and local governments. The so-called “bao gan” means
that the higher authorities in charge implement a revenue contract system based on
a ﬁxed base ﬁgure to dispose of the revenue of the enterprise. The part within the
ﬁxed base ﬁgure will be divided between the higher authorities and the enterprise
according to an agreed proportion. The part exceeding the ﬁxed base ﬁgure will be
largely left to the enterprise. The bao gan system, which was aimed at softening the
strict budget control in the original planned economy, increased the space of
negotiation between the enterprise and its higher authorities. However, this space
only existed in income distribution, and had little to do with the enterprise’s per-
sonnel right, transaction right, etc. Nevertheless, the implementation of the bao gan
system laid the foundation for the contract system a few years after. In the contract
112
4

system, the separation of ownership rights and management rights, as well as the
change in agential relationship, all made substantial progress.
From 1986 onwards, with the implementation of the policy of “separation of
government and enterprises,” the contract system rapidly spread among the
state-owned enterprises. In this process, the administrative structure based on the
danwei system and the simulated price market based on the collective system
became the two basic system frameworks for the operation of the enterprises. The
early enterprise reforms in the cities did not break the power structure of state
ownership. The enterprise itself still did not have the personnel rights in enterprise
management, or the rights of resource allocation in production, or the price
negotiation rights in product sales, etc. However, although no change took place in
ownership rights, the system of overall responsibility by the factory director in
administration was established, entitling the directors to some management rights
within a certain scope.
From 1987, the ﬁrst great boom in enterprise contracting was set off all over the
country. The main forms of enterprise contracting are: (1) “two guarantees and one
linking up,” that is, guarantee the turning over of taxes and proﬁts to higher
authorities, guarantee the approved technical reform projects, link up the total wage
with the proﬁts and taxes; (2) bao gan with commitment to yearly increases of
proﬁts and taxes; (3) bao gan which speciﬁes a base ﬁgure of proﬁts and taxes to be
turned over, and leaves part of the surplus to the enterprise; (4) bao gan of industry
input and output; etc. Some enterprises followed the principle of “guarantee the
base ﬁgure, ensure the turning over of revenue; retain the extra proﬁts, make up for
the loss on your own.” Obviously, the contract system took a great step forward in
the expansion of the autonomy of the state-owned enterprises in operation and
management. However, because of the constraints of many unfavorable conditions,
such as fuzzy ownership, haphazard regulations, information asymmetry, etc., the
enterprise contractors often went about their business operations on short-term
basis, and tried to appropriate the state assets to themselves though various meth-
ods. Until the 1990s, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises had had to
sell production quotas to the government at prices well below the market rate.55 As
their compensation, they received subsidized inputs. If the amount of subsidized
inputs was large, such a kind of quota system would generate high rent values for
the enterprise. According to some scholars’ estimation, from 1986 to 1988, a
state-run enterprise which had market proﬁts in addition to production quota,
received a rent that was 2.7 times the value of its market proﬁts. The bargaining
within the bureaucratic system was far more proﬁtable than market competition.56
The attempt to reform the state-owned enterprises was basically realized as the
contract system, which was aimed at promoting the separation of the management
rights and ownership rights of the state-owned enterprises.57 Although the central

4.3

government carried out experiments of decentralization in different periods, because
the overall system had never gone through any substantial change, the experiments
were generally caught in a vicious cycle, which can be described as “the enterprises
become lifeless when control is tightened, so you relax control over them; they
become chaotic when control is relaxed, so you tighten control over them.”
Why is that so? The reason is that the possession subject (zhan you zhu ti) of the
state-owned enterprises was the state, which was highly abstract; while the pos-
session subject of the township enterprises was the collective, which had land
ownership as its basis, and was very concrete. Compared with the township
enterprises, the ownership structure of the state-owned enterprises lacked the
important dimension of rural collective land ownership. Although the ownership
relations of the township enterprises were very complicated, the structures of the
community and community members deﬁned by the collective land ownership were
very clear. Its real function was to embed the enterprise in a community with a clear
boundary, the members of which had clear scopes of ownership and right of
recourse. In this sense, the contractors of the enterprises must take into full account
the claims legitimatized by the collective ownership, in addition to focusing on
business performance and seeking administrative patronage.
When the contract system of the state-owned enterprises was implemented,
the withdrawal of the state did not change the nature of ownership. When
the administrative relationships were weakened, the ownership relations of the
state-owned enterprises became even more abstract. People only knew that the
enterprise belonged to the state, but they could not understand the speciﬁc rela-
tionship between the enterprises and the state in concrete life. On the other hand,
when the ownership rights and management rights were temporarily separated, the
most concrete change was that the director (manager) had the ﬁnal say. Although
this decision-making power only existed in the sense of agential business operation,
the workers could not feel their rights as the possession subject.
In the state-owned enterprises, because the real possession subject was the whole
people in terms of ownership relations, and the government bureaus and the
enterprise executives were only the subject in agential relations, the ownership
setup only had theoretical and symbolic meanings. As a result, the workers’ claims
of rights did not have a clear direction. Especially when the ownership rights and
management rights were separated by the contract system, the workers’ search of
rights became even more difﬁcult. The retreat of the possession subject undoubtedly
further strengthened the power of management rights. In fact, the ownership
structure of the state-owned enterprises simply could not generate any constraints
on the power of the contractor in a bottom-up manner; only the administrative
constraints existed. On the one hand, the possession subject of the public ownership
system was like a ghost; no one could ascertain its existence. On the other hand, the
contractor did not have to consider any concrete inﬂuence of the ownership rights,
so that the management rights lacked the counterbalance of ownership rights in a
collective sense.

4.3.2
Change in Labor Relations Under the Contract System
At the beginning of the 1980s, the employees of the state-owned enterprises were
still being babysat by the danwei system. Their basic wages were paid according to
uniﬁed standards set by the state on the basis of different industries, different types
of jobs and different levels. Their meager but comprehensive welfare beneﬁts (child
birth, child nursery and schooling, housing, medical treatment, funeral, etc.) were
all provided by the state-owned enterprises through the approach of “the enterprise
running the society.”58 Due to the lack of effective incentive mechanism, and the
decline in the ideological power of the rule of virtue, being slack in work and
violating disciplines became common phenomena in the state-owned enterprises;
the workers’ congress also became a mere formality.
In 1981, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) enacted the
“Provisional Regulations on the Workers’ Congress of the State-owned Industrial
Enterprises,” which stipulated that the workers’ congress was the basic form of
democratic management of the enterprise and the organ by which the workers and
the masses exercised their rights in decision-making, management, and supervision
of cadres. In the following year, the authorities began to advocate the all-round
construction of “the workers’ home” on behalf of the workers under “the executive
command of the factory director, and the uniﬁed leadership of the Party” in the
state-owned enterprises. However, in the ﬁrst decade of the reform, the workers did
not become a main issue on the reform agenda. In many enterprises, the workers’
congress was only a mere formality, and the workers only participated in the
activities of the enterprise on a small scale, such as some welfare social activities
following the old routine of the public enterprises, or production emulation cam-
paigns. These activities did not touch upon the fundamental rights involving the
fundamental interests of the workers. The rights of the workers were still generally
determined and arranged through the approach of state agency (guo jia dai li).
Examined from the perspective of ownership relations, the power structure of the
state-owned enterprise was a very interesting phenomenon. First of all, according to
the provisions of public ownership, the state-owned enterprise was above all owned
by the whole people. The ownership in this sense was not shared by all the
employees of the enterprise, but by all the citizens of the country, or the whole
people. Thus, the possession subject of the state-owned enterprise was actually the
very abstract concept of state sovereignty. Being tantamount to state sovereignty,
such ownership rights had their personality basis in the whole people, and needed a
kind of super rationality to hold and exercise their power.59 Due to the uniform
personality of the public ownership, it was difﬁcult to support the operation of an
enormous economy merely by relying on the central government’s planning
rationality. In this sense, the state-owned enterprises could only rely on the
level-by-level delegation mechanism of the administrative system to conﬁrm the
58See Li (2004).
59Szelényi et al. (2010).
4.3

115

enterprise’s agents at all levels. The employees of the state-owned enterprises
shared the ownership rights ﬁrst of all as part of the whole people. Only after that
could they exercise their rights as members of the enterprise. Therefore, the own-
ership by the employees of the state-owned enterprises was actually detached, that
is, they were entitled to the abstract ownership by the whole people in terms of state
system, but such an abstract ownership was not realized as direct possession in the
organization, which means that the employees only worked in the enterprise on
behalf of the people, and exercised the rights speciﬁed by the ownership relations.
We see that the ownership structure of the state-owned enterprises above all
recognized the workers’ identity as being “state workers.” Therefore, under the
planning system, the state made uniﬁed arrangement for the employment of the
state-owned enterprises. The management of the workers’ wages and welfare
beneﬁts was also controlled by the central government’s labor department. Any
increases in wages or adjustments in welfare beneﬁts must be carried out by the
state in a uniﬁed manner. The identity of “enterprise worker” came only after “state
worker.” When the workers exercised their rights in the enterprise organization,
they always relied on the state as their intermediary. And here the state, in the actual
implementation of rights, was embodied in the level-by-level delegation mechanism
of the administrative system. Since the identity of the workers was ﬁrst of all “state
worker,” the retrieval of their rights must point to the abstract state system. And
because the hierarchical relationships of this system were extremely complex, the
agent at each level could shirk its responsibilities and obligations either upward or
downward, the retrieval of the workers’ rights was extremely difﬁcult. This situa-
tion could be seen very clearly in the late 1990s, when laid-off workers met great
difﬁculty in retrieving their rights. It is precisely because the primary identity of the
workers was “state worker” that the enterprise organization did not constitute the
entire basis for exercising their rights. In this situation, it was very likely that under
the stimulation of ideology their work enthusiasm was elevated, but at the same
time, there was also the possibility of negative effects. After the reform began, the
people’s citizenship awareness gradually weakened, the enterprise workers gradu-
ally lost their identiﬁcation with the enterprises, which gave them a negative
incentive in the exercise of rights.
The challenges faced by the workers in ownership rights came from the change
in power structure brought about by the contract system reform. As the contract
system separated the ownership rights from the management rights, it weakened the
proper basis of the ownership. In actual operation, the factory director (manager)
enjoyed great powers in production organization, product pricing, performance
evaluation and bonus distribution, etc., while the abstract state’s protection of rights
and the legitimacy of level-by-level conﬁrmation in the administrative system were
greatly weakened. In the mean time, because the worker’s identiﬁcation with their
state identity was damaged, the unity within the enterprise organization was also
weakened. During this period, a substantial theoretical bottleneck encountered by
the workers in sharing rights in the state-owned enterprises was the problem of
management rights agency. Although the enterprises still belonged to the state, the
business operation of the enterprises seemed to be carried out through the
116

principal-agent system. Before the reform, the state-owned enterprises used the “big
pot” system, and basically adopted a model of income distribution based on
administrative levels, qualiﬁcations and record of service. After the implementation
of the contract system, although the distribution of the ﬁxed wages still followed the
original method, the distribution of the incremental part of income (bonuses and
beneﬁts under various names) was completely under the control of the contractor
(director or manager). The contractor decided all by themselves who could get how
much bonuses, who could enjoy the incremental part of the rights and powers.
Thus, this system evolved into a de facto dual-track system. The participation
rights and other relevant rights of the so-called workers’ congress were deﬁned by
the state. Like before, a large part of these had the qualities of formalism. On the
other hand, the workers’ rights of sharing business beneﬁts relied on the contrac-
tor’s arbitrary decisions. The distribution of this incremental part of income was
once carried out through approaches of complete information block (e.g., the
so-called “red envelope”), with the workers being totally unaware of the overall
situation. In fact, the latter distribution mechanism and the former were completely
contradictory. The majority of the workers were completely shut out, which seri-
ously dampened their enthusiasm of participation, and turned into a satire against
the original workers’ congress system. Labor relations in this period had two kinds
of impact on income distribution. Firstly, the state-owned enterprises, which had the
state as the possession subject, gave the workers standardized distribution rights
that were uniﬁed nationwide. Secondly, in business operation of the contract sys-
tem, the workers were also given the incremental distribution rights following the
principle of “more pay for more work done” with the so-called performance
appraisal. Especially in the late 1980s, in some enterprises, when the second part of
the distribution rights brought much higher income than the ﬁrst part, the
state-owned nature of the enterprises began to face challenges, and their qualities of
being state-owned began to gradually weaken in reality. Because the business
revenue of some enterprises rose much higher than the national standard, their
directors (managers) gradually further expanded the management rights, which
weakened the control of the state.
At the same time, in the contracting operation of the state-owned enterprises, the
administrative power’s rent-seeking became rampant; the business contractors and
agents were given too much power in the ﬁelds of independent distribution, and
clear legal restrictions were missing; the state-owned assets began to gradually
drain away through the gray zones. In addition, the rapid economic development
of the Special Economic Zones led to sharp contrast in income between the SEZs
and the inland. As a result of all these factors, many state-owned enterprise workers
in the inland began to feel a severe sense of deprivation.60 More importantly, the
reform of enterprise power in this period basically followed the model of separating
management rights from ownership rights, and did not touch upon the rights of the
workers. Moreover, with the increasing autonomy of the contractor, the workers’
60See Li and Jingdong (2005).
4.3
State-Owned Enterprises: Labor Relations Under the Contract System

rights awareness as the owner of the enterprise under the original ideology began to
face the challenges of reality. In the mid-1980s, some state-owned enterprises began
to suffer from workers’ passive slowdown and violation of disciplines. At the same
time, some enterprise workers began to go into business as self-employed busi-
nessmen under the arrangement of “retain the job but suspend the salary,” or
migrate to the eastern coastal areas or the SEZs.
In particular, when the quantity of incremental distribution far exceeded the
quantity of stock distribution, when the contractors carried out secret manipulation
of state assets through subordinate collective enterprises to conduct other gray
distributions in addition to wages and bonuses, the workers began to harbor strong
suspicion about the legitimacy of those old systems of rights before the reform and
tended to regard them as mere formality. In fact, after several years of contract
system reform of the state-owned enterprise, although some enterprises had
improved their operations and increased their operating income, large-scale pas-
sivity arose in the maintenance of labor discipline and protection of rights within
enterprise organizations. Worker participation was almost non-existent; many
enterprises’ workers’ congress existed only in name. This situation greatly affected
the relationships between the workers inside the enterprise. Due to the weakening of
ideology, as well as the increasing gap in income distribution and personnel ﬂow,
the kind of intimate relationship in the old systems of collaboration and mentorship
also gradually weakened.
Difference in ownership level and difference in the degree of separation of
ownership rights and management rights result in different inﬂuences on labor
relations. As to some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises which were
not included in the reform, the enterprise governance was still in the form of the
socialist danwei system of the pre-reform period. The wages and welfare beneﬁts of
the workers were set strictly according to the administrative level, qualiﬁcations and
record of service. The whole life course of the workers, from the cradle to the tomb,
was under the arrangement of the danwei. In these enterprises, a rather complete
system of the workers’ congress, as well as other various participation channels in
labor, technology, and production activities, were still functioning, although the
way and level of participation were strictly controlled by the administrative
authorities. In a sense, these large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises were
still like an administrative organization, the basic organizational model of which
was an overall bureaucratic system characterized by a power hierarchy from the top
to the bottom. As for those state-owned enterprises that were included in the
contract system reform, although path dependence in the sense of the danwei
system still existed, and the original labor relations could not be removed, such
labor relations were much looser compared with the past. Although the methods of
distribution under the contract system were more ﬂexible, and could produce some
incentive effects temporarily, all the institutional basis of the labor relations had
been weakened, and the fundamental logic of the so-called socialist ownership of
the whole people was threatened ideologically. It is worth noting that in this period,
in the SEZs in the southeastern coastal areas, foreign companies and joint ventures
were introduced, whose operation completely followed the logic of capital.
118

Especially in some processing enterprises, the primitive exploitation of capital
emerged; the labor relations had the characteristics of pure employment
relationship. The principles of capital supremacy and efﬁciency coming ﬁrst, to
which these enterprises ﬁrmly adhered, exerted strong and complicated inﬂuences
on various types of enterprises in the inland.
4.3.3
The Collective System in the State-Owned Enterprises
From the perspective of state policy, the contract system reform had obviously
implemented the dual-track logic of planning and market, that is, “guarantee the
base quota, ensure the turning over of revenue” with regard to the stock, “retain the
extra proﬁts, make up for the loss on one’s own” with regard to the increments. The
enterprises had to fulﬁll the tasks of administrative commands through “bao gan of
turning over ﬁxed-sum revenue and bao gan of annual increase.” At the same time,
the enterprises needed to be given a certain degree of autonomy through “sharing of
proﬁts according to set proportions,” so that the total amount of wages could be
linked up with proﬁts and taxes.61 In fact, the contract system reform did not fully
realize the goal of “separation of government and enterprises” stressed by the
central government in the same period, which produced a double effect. On the one
hand, the decentralization of power and concession of proﬁts to the state-owned
enterprises caused the enterprises to focus their activities on business operation, and
created a certain degree of management incentives and labor incentives through
appropriate income adjustment. On the other hand, however, this reform did not
change the administrative structure of the state-owned enterprises which was based
on the danwei system. On the contrary, because the enterprises had a certain degree
of autonomy and some proﬁt margins, they became a ﬁeld for power intervention.
Therefore, the administrative system based on the danwei system and the “simu-
lated market” run on the platform of the collective system62 became the two basic
mechanisms for the operation of the contract system reform.
The collective enterprises in China’s urban communities could be divided into
two major categories, collective enterprises run by factories (chang ban ji ti qi ye)
and collective enterprises run by communities (she ban ji ti qi ye). In the late 1970s,
large numbers of educated youth returned to the towns and cities. The state-owned
enterprises and street communities set up and supported a number of collective
enterprises for “resettlement,” in an attempt to solve the employment problem of the
spouses and children of the workers in their jurisdiction. At the beginning of the
reform, the collective enterprises were somewhat treated as an “adopted son.” The
state-owned enterprises provided some administrative support for the collective
61See Zheng (2008, pp. 34–35).

enterprises, such as offering help in setting up the enterprise, in investment projects
and in going through government formalities. The state-owned enterprises also
provided some economic support for the collective enterprises, such as providing
the initial funds, some old equipment, factory buildings, work sites, or sending
management and technical personnel, or helping them to get loans, etc.63 This is
another form of “the enterprise running the society” and “enterprise welfare.”
From the perspective of ownership relations, the collective enterprises can be
regarded as the “secondary property rights” of the state-owned enterprises under the
danwei system. There was also difference in the workers’ status. A clear distinction
was made between “whole people ownership system workers” and “collective
system workers.” Compared with the collective township enterprises, which had the
quality of village communities, the collective enterprises run by the state-owned
enterprise did not have any features of natural rights. They were not the collective
ownership system in its real sense, but rather resembled a subordinate danwei
administratively afﬁliated to the state-owned enterprise. The enterprise-run collec-
tive enterprises always existed in a paradox. They had heavy administrative
dependence in terms of ownership and management. As enterprise organizations,
they were under the control of another state danwei; however, their workers did not
have the status of “state workers,” did not have the rights of “public ownership.”
Their rights and status were very fuzzy.
With the implementation of the contract system in the enterprises, especially the
implementation of the system of overall responsibility by factory director (man-
ager), the state-owned enterprises actually began to run according to both the stock
logic of the planned economy and the incremental logic of the market economy. In
the danwei system, the rights of management personnel appointment and removal,
the resource allocation rights, and the price negotiation rights were still subject to
the restriction of government commands. However, within the administrative
authority of the factory director (manager) who was in charge of the contract
operation, especially in a “secondary property-rights” danwei such as a collective
enterprise, the enterprise had sufﬁcient autonomy. The contract system did not fully
realize the structure of common ownership rights of collective possession in these
enterprises. In the mean time, the rights of the director (manager) as the agent of
administrative entrustment were not independent. On the one hand, their appoint-
ment and dismissal, as well as their term of service were all decided by higher-level
authorities. On the other hand, they were not entitled to any residual rights. As a
result, the contract under the contract system did not have full binding effect.64
Under the conditions of insufﬁcient agency in the danwei system and fuzzy
ownership rights in the collective system, the enterprise agent was very prone to
heighten the manipulation of the subordinate collective enterprises to carry out
simulated market operations in order to escape the heavy constraints of the planned
economy. In the second half of the 1980s, collective enterprises, especially

Changes in Labor Relations in the Dual-Track …

collective enterprises run by factories, played an important role in urban economic
system reform. Under the condition of dual-track pricing, the state-owned enter-
prises could use their administrative advantages of the danwei system to coordinate
with relevant administrative departments of interests to bargain with higher-level
authorities, even with the central government, over state resources like production
quota, pricing of the means of production, industrial monopoly, ﬁnancial subsidies,
etc., so as to gain as much policy bonuses as possible in the command economy. In
the mean time, the state-owned enterprises could also make use of the quasi-market
principles to develop the increments, and engage in various trading activities with
various business entities. In this respect, those collective enterprises run by facto-
ries, which the state-owned enterprises had absolute control, became the most
convenient trading platform for such activities.
During this period, the state-owned enterprises built wide and close connections
with township enterprises and other non-public business organizations. Especially
in their relevant industrial ﬁelds, the state-owned enterprises often adopted the
outsourcing system and awarded contracts for processing primary products to
township enterprises, and provided them with support in planned prices for means
of production, in production technology and technical personnel, in exchange for
the proﬁts of the township enterprises in market operation. However, in the regions
where the state-owned large-and-medium-sized enterprises were dominant, the
collective enterprises performed a powerful function of simulated market operation.
The collective system of this period was different from that in the late 1970s. Since
the contract system was implemented in the state-owned enterprises, the collective
enterprises run by factories had been ﬁrmly controlled by their dominating
state-owned enterprises. Through these important carriers, the state-owned enter-
prises extended their reach to various businesses. In the absence of effective legal
and democratic supervision, the enterprise agents tended to place their own relatives
and friends in the key positions of the collective enterprises of “secondary property
rights,” which were used as strongholds for private contact and secret rendezvous
with non-public business entities. They either directly made proﬁts through the gap
between the planned price and the market price, or transferred valuable assets to
these collective enterprises to engage in “black box operation.”65 When the col-
lective enterprises were ﬁrst set up, no clear relationships of investment, loan, or
patronage were nailed down with their founders, investors, departments in charge or
investing employees. As a result, their rights relationships with their superior
state-owned enterprises were irregular and unclear. It is in this sense that the col-
lective enterprises became the preferred place for the state-owned enterprises to
consolidate, optimize, conceal and transfer assets.
In fact, in contracting operations, the collective system of the state-owned
enterprise was an important gray zone. On the one hand, the state-owned enterprises
made good use of their advantages in state resource allocation. On the other hand,
they were able to circumvent to a certain degree the constraints of the administrative
65Sachs et al. (2000).

system and certain state provisions on the rights and interests of the workers. For
those workers who only had collective status, their wages, treatment and welfare
beneﬁts were not much different from those of state enterprise workers at the
beginning of the reform and opening-up. However, with the deepening of the
contract system reform and the loosening of the ﬁxed employment system, due to
lack of protection from primary property rights and ownership relations, the gap in
rights between these workers and the state enterprise workers increasingly widened;
they gradually lost their residual right and its recourse space. In fact, during the
process of enterprise restructuring, they were the ﬁrst group of workers to be let go.
In short, the objective of the reform and opening up was to use the approach of
the dual-track system to foster incremental growth, so as to gradually weaken the
stock rigidity of the overall system, and release the vitality of the enterprises. From
decentralization to bao gan, and then to contracting, in the 1980s the state-owned
enterprises attempted to gradually break through the planning system, and use the
market approach to solve the problems of business operation and management.
However, due to complex changes in the three dimensions of possession, operation
and governance, the enterprises did not fully accomplish the marketization exper-
iment. In the mean time, the foundation for organizational unity was weakened to a
certain extent. As a result of these conditions, in the process of full marketization
reform in the 1990s, the state-owned enterprises were to face even greater chal-
lenges, and undertake even more difﬁcult tests.

China’s
socio-economic development sank into a three-year long stagnation. Since Deng
Xiaoping’s talks in Southern China in 1992, China’s enterprises entered an
important stage which economists called “reform breakthrough period.” In this
stage, both the state-owned enterprises and the private enterprises endeavored to
establish a modern enterprise system; the enterprise reform was brought onto the
track of marketization and rule of law. At the same time, the relationship between
the central government and the local governments also underwent important
changes through ﬁscal and taxation reforms based on “the tax-sharing system” (fen
shui zhi). Deng Xiaoping’s talks in Southern China were undoubtedly the only way
out for China’s economic system, which had already built up the momentum of
reform. The dual-track system must be replaced by an integrated market system.
The de facto economic model of the collective system in the township enterprises
and large numbers of state-owned enterprises must be replaced by a system of
clearer property rights. On the one hand, the marketization reform promoted by the
government greatly liberated the social productive forces. On the other hand, the
full-scale marketization reform carried out in the middle and late 1990s also threw
the state-owned enterprises and their workers into a deep crisis.

“dual-track system” approach from the 1980s underwent important changes. The
government gradually adjusted and adapted to the way of dealing with large-scale
“extra-institutional ﬂow of resources”1 produced by the market and the market
economy. New mechanisms and new patterns affecting the redistribution of eco-
nomic interests were established. The changes in this stage have inﬂuenced the
route of the entire reform and constitute the basis for our understanding of the main
difﬁculties faced by the current reform. “Stability” and “development” are the two
basic criteria for the reform of the new period. Social stability is regarded as the
fundamental guarantee of economic development. Vice versa, the principle of
“economic growth coming ﬁrst” is a prerequisite for social stability. From the
government to the common people, the consensus was gradually formed that social
stability cannot be achieved through changes in the political and ideological ﬁelds,
but through rapid economic growth and improvement of the people’s living
standards.
One of the important reasons why the rural reform in the early and middle 1980s
went well was that it did not act against the vested interests of urban residents. After
the start of urban reform in 1984, the pace of rural reform was subject to the direct
constraint of the existing system of urban-rural separation. In the 1990s, policy
changes such as the implementation of the contract system and the abolishment of
the state monopoly of purchase and marketing had lost their sting, and the
momentum of rural development signiﬁcantly decreased. The prices of agricultural
production inputs rose much faster than the prices of agricultural products, and the
gap of the “price scissors” continuously widened. The township enterprises were
faced with funding problems and other difﬁculties. The country’s investment in
agriculture stopped increasing, and even declined. The dualist urban-rural structure
was in a sense further strengthened. However, its maintenance mechanism under-
went some important changes during the 1990s.
In the era of the planned economy, the dualist structure was set up on the basis of
administrative system arrangements, in particular the household registration system
and state monopoly of the purchase and marketing of grain. This can be called the
“administration-oriented dualist structure.” After the 1990s, although some systems
such as the system of state monopoly of purchase and marketing had ended, and
other systems such as the household registration system had undergone important
changes,2 the administrative power sometimes directly exerted important impact on
the dualist structure through land contracts, and sometimes exerted inﬂuence
through the market, and sometimes the market played an independent role. Taking
all these into consideration, we call this “the power/market-oriented dualist struc-
ture.” The concrete features of this type of structure are as follows.
1See Sun et al. (1994).
2These changes include the following. The movement of urban and rural residents is no longer
restricted; in some small and medium-sized towns, the tight control over household registration has
been relaxed; even in the big cities where the constraints of household registration still exist, its
importance in social life has already diminished.

The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

Firstly, the outﬂow of labor force had dual effects. In the 1990s, the momentum
of system reforms in the rural areas weakened, and the government’s investment in
the rural areas declined. At this time, the main driving force behind the change in
the pattern of urban-rural relationship came from the large-scale and trans-regional
movement of the peasant labor force. The outﬂow of labor force had dual effects.
On the one hand, it could promote the integration of urban and rural labor markets
and achieve the reallocation of resources on a wider scale. According to some
researches, from 1978 to 1998, the average annual growth rate of GDP was 9, 24%
of which was contributed by the expansion of labor force, 24% was contributed by
human capital, and 21% was contributed by the transfer of labor force from agri-
culture to non-agricultural industries.3 On the other hand, after entering the cities,
rural migrant workers were generally given unequal treatments from the urban
workers in terms of politics, economy and social welfare, resulting in the contin-
uous reproduction of urban-rural disparities in the urban life. In the mean time, the
outﬂow of large numbers of young and middle-aged rural adults also led to the
desolation of rural economy and rural social life. The peasants’ income from
agriculture declined continuously. In 1998, the peasants’ average income from
agriculture decreased by more than 30 yuan from the previous year. It decreased
again by more than 50 yuan in 1999, and by more than 40 yuan in 2000. The
one-way ﬂow of resources from the countryside to the non-agricultural industries
and the cities continued. From 1980 to 2000, 2300 billion yuan of funds was
transferred from the rural areas into the urban sectors; industry absorbed 1290
billion yuan from agriculture.4 Moreover, the status of the rural families, which was
enhanced by the land contract system reform in the 1980s, was weakened again by
the outﬂow of large numbers of migrant workers. The rural families’ functions of
providing social protection for the peasants and ensuring their sustainable devel-
opment also diminished.
Secondly, the tax-sharing system reform had unexpected consequences. In 1994
China began to implement the tax-sharing system reform. The reform, which had
been intended to strengthen the centralization of authority, effectively changed the
behavior of the local governments. However, the change did not happen in the
expected direction, it served to strengthen the role of the local governments as a
main stakeholder. Although the local governments’ tax revenues were greatly
reduced, the number of people who depended on government ﬁnance for their
living kept increasing. The local governments’ normal revenues were not enough to
support their operation. To cover the deﬁcit, the local governments levied fees on
the peasants in various names, resulting in a huge burden on the peasants. In 2000,
the total tax burden of the peasants was 135.9 billion yuan, an increase of 1.89
times from 46.9 billion yuan in 1990. The per capita burden of peasants increased
by 2.01 times in the same period. Taxes and fees accounted for 7 to 12% of the
peasants’
income.

marketization of medical care greatly increased the expenditure of the peasants. All
these factors contributed to the decline in their disposable income. In 1996, the per
capita annual income of peasants increased by 9%, followed by an increase of 4.6%
in 1997. After that, the increase rate declined all the way. In 2000, the increase rate
was only 2.1%.5
Thirdly, the “agricultural products scissors difference” gave way to the “land
scissors difference.” Before the reform, the gap between the urban and rural areas
was mainly reﬂected in the price scissors of agricultural products. Since the 1990s,
a new “scissors difference” between the urban and rural areas emerged, i.e., the
so-called “land scissors difference.” This new “scissors difference” came into being
under the background of strengthening the role of the local governments as main
stakeholders. Although the rural land was owned collectively, the village collective
in fact had no right to trade it freely on the market. Only the government had the
right to make requisitions of or purchase rural land and set the prices. Then the
government would sell the land-use right to enterprises at high prices.
Fourthly, the age of life necessities was succeeded by the age of durable con-
sumer goods. This was an important change in the Chinese society in the
mid-to-late 1990s. A direct indicator of this change was the Engel coefﬁcient. In
1999, the Engel coefﬁcient of the urban residents in China fell to 41.95%, a change
that had great signiﬁcance. In the age of life necessities, the main consumption of
the urban dwellers was agricultural products, which means the main part of their
income was spent on the products of the peasants. Despite the existence of “price
scissors,” the connection between the urban and rural areas remained strong
because of the ﬂow of resources, and the cities had a considerable degree of
dependence on the countryside. However, in the age of durable consumer goods,
the daily necessities of the urban dwellers were no longer dependent on the
countryside, and the majority of their expenditures ceased to have relations with the
peasants or the countryside, even a considerable portion of their food was pur-
chased on the international market. A rupture in the new market tie between the
urban and rural areas could be seen.6
To draw a big picture of this period, the so-called “san nong” problems (three
agriculture-related problems) became increasingly prominent, i.e., the slow growth
of peasants’ income, the shrinkage of agricultural production, the serious shortage
of public services in rural areas, and the widening gap between the cities and
countryside. The income ratio between urban and rural residents increased from
2.51 in 1990 to 2.83 in 1995, then to 3.01 in 2002.7
5Chen (2005).
6Sun Liping was the ﬁrst to propose that in the middle and late 1990s the urban-rural structure
changed from the administration-oriented type to the market-oriented type (Sun 2005). The term,
“market-oriented type,” was based on the impact of the coming era of durable consumer goods on
urban and rural daily life. We think this is a very keen observation, but it can be considered in
combination with other changes in the urban-rural relations at that time. Thus we put forward the
concept, “power/market-oriented dual structure.”

The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

5.1.2
The Tax-Sharing System Reform and Enterprise
Change
In 1994, the central government carried out tax and ﬁscal reforms. The ﬁnancial
contract system was abandoned. In its place, the tax-sharing system was imple-
mented. The tax-sharing system was a typical reform aimed at re-centralizing ﬁscal
revenue. Its basic content was to adopt an approach of dividing the budgeted tax
revenues between the central and local governments according to relatively ﬁxed
tax categories, so as to avoid endless negotiations and bargaining. As to the huge
amounts of tax revenues which went to the central government, the systems of tax
returns and transfer payments were used to transfer a part of these revenues still for
the expenditure of the local governments.8 The tax-sharing system was well
designed in terms of centralizing revenues. Under this system design, the central
government attempted to regain the control of local government behaviors and
adjust the direction of local economic development. However, after more than a
decade of implementing the tax-sharing system, the results showed that although
this centralization approach effectively changed the behaviors of local governments,
the change has not developed in the planned direction, neither has the centralization
achieved its desired effects.
The tax-sharing system reform had far-reaching inﬂuence and great signiﬁcance.
It was crucial for understanding the reform of the following 15 years. The reform
was expected to have two effects. The ﬁrst was to completely change the pattern of
incessant bargaining between the central government and the local governments
over the base ﬁgure of bao gan, or the proportion of revenue division. The second
was to change the development model in which the local governments ran the
enterprises and dominated local economic development. The tax-sharing reform
was not only a reform of the ﬁscal and taxation system, but also a major adjustment
of the central-local relations since the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
From a micro perspective, this reform also profoundly affected the historical destiny
of various forms of enterprise organizations.
The tax-sharing system effectively changed the relationship between the local
governments and the local enterprises. To a certain extent, the relationship between
the two became looser than before. Because the central government did not share the
risks of enterprise business operation and bankruptcy, compared with the ﬁnancial
contract system in the past, under the tax-sharing system the local governments
yielded fewer revenues but faced greater risks in setting up and running enterprises.
Moreover, because the value-added tax (VAT) was a type of turnover tax, and was
levied according to the invoice regardless of whether the business was proﬁtable or
not, as long as the enterprise had input and output, it had to pay the value-added tax.
For those enterprises which had only meager proﬁts but high operating costs, the
8Some scholars hold that this situation has come to the so-called “bottom line of decentralization.”
If the trend was allowed to develop further, the country would face the danger of “being split into
separatist vassal states.” See Wang (1997).
5.1

VAT was undoubtedly a heavy burden. In the mean time, the VAT was levied by the
State Administration of Taxation (SAT) system, which had vertical management and
was rather detached from the local government. This nulliﬁed the various prefer-
ential policies made by the local government to protect local enterprises. In this
situation, although the VAT rebate policy adopted by the central government gave
certain incentives to the regions with high VAT contribution, we can still reasonably
assume that the local government’s enthusiasm for running industrial enterprises
would be heavily dampened. This speculation was proven by reality. After the
tax-sharing system reform, the state-owned enterprises began to carry out the
shareholding system reform on a large scale, and the local governments vigorously
promoted the transformation of township enterprises. By the end of the 1990s, the
township enterprises had almost ceased to exist except in name, and became private.
Although the academia has offered abundant research and explanations for China’s
enterprise restructuring in the 1990s, in the context of China’s reform, the govern-
ment’s leadership and guidance should not be neglected as a main clue for under-
standing such large-scale economic phenomena. After the tax-sharing system reform,
the local government launched a massive campaign to turn the township enterprises
and state-owned enterprises into private enterprises, “enterprises on sale” became the
order of the day. The government no longer dominated the daily management and
basic operations of the enterprises, but exerted inﬂuences on them through indirect
means like levying taxes and fees. One of the main reasons was that under the
tax-sharing system, it was impossible for the local industrial enterprises to bring
substantial revenues for the local government. The corporate income tax (a type of
local tax), which used the corporate proﬁts as the tax base, was the largest source of
ﬁscal revenue that the local government could obtain from industrial enterprises. This
tax depended on the economic efﬁciency of the enterprise. The establishment of the
legal person in property rights relations,as well as the restructuring and transformation
towards the modern enterprise system, were undoubtedly conducive to the enter-
prises’ business operation in accordance with the principle of efﬁciency. Therefore,
although the property rights theory of neoclassical economics provided a theoretical
basis of for explaining the enterprise restructuring, such explanations are valid only
when taking into account government behaviors.
5.2
Enterprise Restructuring and the Transformation
of Ownership Relations
In the 1990s, there were a lot of system preparations for the wave of property rights
reform and enterprise restructuring. In September 1992, the central authorities
transferred the pricing rights of 571 means of production products to the enterprises,
and delegated the pricing rights of 22 products to the provincial price departments,
leaving the pricing of only 89 products at the hands of the central government. This
indicated that the price control had already been eased, market prices gradually

replaced planned prices, and the reform had entered a new stage beyond the
dual-track system. At the same time, the ownership pattern of the Chinese enter-
prises also began to undergo major changes, and private economy had entered a
booming track. As mentioned above, the revitalization of the private economy had
two main causes. Firstly, the local government increased the intensity of investment
in ﬁxed assets in order to rapidly expand the scale of government ﬁnance and boost
GDP growth. Secondly, the market-oriented reform promoted the township enter-
prises under the original collective system, the local state-owned enterprises, and
the collective enterprises afﬁliated to state-owned enterprises to carry out ownership
transformation following the principle of corporatization. Thus, starting from the
cultivation of market elements in the governance system, a comprehensive trans-
formation of ownership relations began.
Market reform must start with the adjustment of ownership relations, and center
on ownership reform. Only in this way can the reform thoroughly remove the
dual-track logic of fuzzy property rights operation under the collective ownership
system. The concept of market economy cleared the practical and ideological
restrictions of the original planned economic system. It also gave legitimacy to the
independent operation of all forms of private ownership in the socio-economic
structure. The local governments and enterprises in South China and Southeast
China were the most sensitive to the spirit of Deng Xiaoping’s southern talks and
the changes in China’s strategies of social and economic development. Among the
various models of township enterprises in China, the Southern Jiangsu model had
been regarded as the best model because the idea that it had embodied was the
closest to the socialist ideology. However, at the end of 1992, when some local
state-owned enterprises in Wuxi, Suzhou and Changzhou (These three cities are all
located in Southern Jiangsu.) met ﬁnancial difﬁculties, the local authorities quickly
transferred the management rights of these deﬁcit-ridden small state-owned or
collective enterprises to the hands of private business owners through the approa-
ches of ﬁxed rent or auction sales.9 At the same time, the township enterprises,
which were originally ﬁrmly controlled by the local government, also set off a
vigorous restructuring campaign throughout the 1990s. The majority of the col-
lective ownership enterprises were converted into joint-stock enterprises or
joint-stock cooperative enterprises. The collective enterprises in Guangdong, Fujian
and Zhejiang, where family capital and overseas Chinese capital had already had an
absolute advantage, also quickly went through privatization. Besides, many
township enterprises with the so-called “red hat,” which were indeed private
enterprises in disguise, showed their true colors.10 In addition, the collective
9See Sachs et al. (2003).
10In many places, the number of private enterprises in the “red hat” is much larger than the number
of registered private enterprises. According to a report on China Daily on March 31, 1995, a 1993
survey found that there were at least 1000 private enterprises in Hebei Province, but the ofﬁcial
number was only 8. See “A protective cap over vacillating enterprises”, China Daily, March 31,
1995. quoted from Yang (2011). Notes on China’s economic history over a hundred years.

enterprises afﬁliated to the state-owned enterprises ﬁnally completed their mission
in the era of the dual-track system. Those with good asset structure and big market
potentials also completed the transformation toward private ownership through
open or conﬁdential methods.11
From the perspective of governance, a precondition for adjusting ownership
relations was to straighten out the legal relations. The transition from the dual-track
system to the rule of law was a key step in the reforms of the 1990s. Because the
ownership relations have an inherent demand on legal clarity, the reform of the laws
is crucial to redeﬁning the ownership structure. The Company Law of the People’s
Republic of China was promulgated at the end of 1993, and came into effect half a
year later. From the perspective of enterprise organization, the promulgation of the
Company Law indeed changed the situation that the enterprises had no laws to
observe and no legal authority to appeal to in property rights issues and business
operation in the era of the contract system. With the Company Law in place, the
enterprise governance structure could achieve “corporatization” (gong si hua) in the
sense of the modern enterprise system in accordance with the laws. To begin with,
corporatization means to clearly deﬁne the corporate nature of the enterprises, so
that they can become independent economic entities, and can bear civil liabilities
independently. At the same time, the enterprise must operate in accordance with
standard cost accounting and ﬁnancial accounting systems. More importantly, the
Company Law strictly deﬁned the property rights relations, that is, the ownership
structure and the rights relations between the owners and the executive depart-
ments.12 Corporatization helped shape standard and complete legal and organiza-
tional structures for the modern enterprise in the aspects of possession, operation
and governance, so that vast numbers of private enterprises could experience great
changes that bordered on rebirth over the next few years. It not only raised the
political status of private ownership, and realized a form of property rights that was
most conducive to capital operation, but also brought into play a variety of learning
abilities, especially in technological imitation and innovation, business management
and incentives, talent cultivation and absorption, labor supply and so on. All such
learning helped the enterprises to carry out operational restructuring in the modern
sense with the core purpose of expanding proﬁts. The results were rapid expansion
of business scale, rapid increase in efﬁciency, and rapid increase in core competi-
tiveness, which laid a solid foundation for the market exploration of export-oriented
products in the following years.
The ﬁrst to beneﬁt from the legal reform was the non-state-owned business
sector. In contrast to the booming private economy, in the early 1990s, although the
state-owned sector continued to grow in total, about two-thirds of the state-owned
enterprises encountered operating losses. What are the reasons? With the formation
11Sociological studies on property rights are basically centered around the topic of how property
rights are socially formed, which offer meticulous researches on the micro-mechanisms of the
formation of property rights. See Xiaoye and Yingying (2005).

of a uniﬁed market, the price barriers were broken, the administrative privileges
were weakened, and enterprises of all forms of ownership must readjust the
enterprise layout in accordance with the market allocation system and focus on
production efﬁciency. However, the state-owned enterprises while maintaining the
welfare system of “the enterprise running the society,” continued to transform
state-owned assets through the collective system. They relied on government
subsidies and rents to maintain economic growth, and depended on monopolistic
state-owned banks to shoulder all their corporate debts.13 In fact, because the
state-owned enterprises’ mode of operation and mode of proﬁt-making violated the
logic of the market economy and the principle of efﬁciency, their ﬁnancial situation
were experiencing unprecedented deterioration. However, this situation again
strengthened the enterprises’ bargaining power with the government and the banks.
The local government’s enhanced role of a stakeholder and the state-owned
enterprises’ bad debts caused the rapid decline of the government’s tax capacity and
the rise of local protectionism, which constituted the basic background for the
tax-sharing system reform introduced by the central government three years later.
5.2.1
The Reform of Property Rights in State-Owned
Enterprises
The most important part of the state-owned enterprise reform was to establish the
modern corporate governance system with the concept of legal person at its core. In
July 1992, the State Council promulgated the “Rules for Shifting the Operational
Mechanism of the Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People” (hereinafter
referred to as the “Rules”), which set forth the overall objectives of state-owned
enterprise reform in the new stage. The enterprises should change their operating
mechanism to meet the requirements of the market. They should become corporate
legal persons that have independent civil rights and shoulder independent civil
obligations. They should become production and business units that independently
operate according to law, that are responsible for their own losses and proﬁts, that
are capable of developing on their own and that are self-disciplined. The “Rules”
bestowed 14 independent rights to the enterprises, which was the third large-scale
move of decentralization in China’s enterprise reform. Different from the previous
two contract systems, the third move particularly emphasized abidance by law, and
pointed out that the establishment of a complete corporate governance structure was
the primary goal of future reform. An important feature of the concept of corporate
governance is that it emphasizes the essential status of ownership relations, which
was avoided by the previous contract system reforms. It established the legal
foundation for the ownership rights to determine the management rights, and clearly
stated that this was the primary precondition for the marketization reform.
13Wang (2001).
5.2
Enterprise Restructuring and the Transformation of Ownership …
131

Shortly after, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) announced the socio-economic development principle of establishing the
socialist market economic system, and for the ﬁrst time changed the name of the
whole people ownership enterprises from “guo ying qi ye” (state-run enterprises) to
“guo you qi ye” (state-owned enterprises). Although there is only a one-character
difference, it indicates fundamental changes. From “guo ying qi ye” to “guo you qi
ye,” the changes are mainly reﬂected in these aspects. Firstly, the state no longer
interfered in the speciﬁc aspects of the enterprises’ business operation, no longer
determined the production goals and market operations of the enterprises through the
planned economy or the dual-track system. The clear ownership relations of “guo you
qi ye” began to weaken the administrative relationship of level-by-level delegation.
Unlike the contract system, under which even the separation of ownership rights and
management rights could not guarantee the autonomous status of enterprise orga-
nizations, the new approach entitled the enterprises to all-round basic rights of
independent operation. Secondly, this one-character difference also indicates that the
state had begun to use the logic of capital and market to adjust and construct the entire
system of state-owned enterprises. The state only had personnel rights in the level of
state agents (the leading group of the enterprises), but the enterprises’ administrative
jurisdiction would be gradually delegated to specialized or local administrative
departments. The number of enterprises directly under the central authorities would
be greatly reduced, and the enterprise’s ownership structure would experience
gradual transition to the civil order of corporate governance. Therefore, the enter-
prises’ ownership rights and management rights, as well as other rights related to
these, must be gradually brought onto the track of the rule of law, that is, various
rights and obligations of the enterprises, as well as the overall structure of their rights
and obligations, must have legal basis in written laws.14 This means that the enter-
prises’ ownership and management structures were no longer subject to the control
and planning of the government, but subject to the basic principles of civil law.
However, in the process of redeﬁning ownership relations, further difﬁculties
were encountered. Although the withdrawal of state administration was conducive
to the enterprises’ independent business operation and decision-making, it posed a
challenge to the fundamental nature of the state-owned enterprises. Although in the
past the state managed the enterprises through plans, commands and the adminis-
trative system, and created many problems in production and efﬁciency, the
dominance of public ownership was ﬁrmly established in ideology, that is, the
broad masses of workers were entitled to enterprise ownership in the sense of the
dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, the legal representative of the enterprise
was the state, and the state made uniﬁed arrangements for the workers’ wages,
14In fact, as early as 1992, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System and the
relevant departments had already formulated and promulgated a series of 14 regulations and other
documents concerning corporate governance, including the “Pilot Measures for the Joint-stock
Enterprises,” “Regulatory Opinions on Joint-stock Limited Companies,” “Regulatory Opinions on
Limited Liability Companies,” and the joint-stock enterprise ﬁnancial and accounting system,
personnel management system, etc.
132

The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

social welfare and other rights. In essence, the enterprise workers were state
workers. However, the corporatization of the enterprise brought a prominent
problem. In terms of power structure, the state became the real owner of the
enterprise, and the enterprise manager (or the board chairman or general manager in
the shareholding system) became the legal representative, and the status of the
broad masses of workers became fuzzy.
The result was that the workers’ wages, social insurance, welfare and other rights
were no longer delegated to the state by consensual rights, but determined
according to the speciﬁc circumstance of each enterprise. The identity of the
workers gradually changed from the original “state worker” to an identity deﬁned
by the contract system in essence and by the public ownership in form. On the one
hand, as state workers, they still enjoyed the protection of the state minimum wage
standard; but their welfare was gradually decreased by the state, or taken over by
the enterprise itself. Throughout the 1990s the welfare of the broad masses of
workers decreased continually, until being cancelled once and for all when
all-round marketization was implemented in the end of the 1990s. On the other
hand, the enterprises which adopted corporate governance structure began to
implement the contract employment system, and began to follow the logic of capital
in setting up their own labor management and external labor market.
Starting from 1993, China launched pilot projects of new enterprise organization
systems in many places, with straightening out ownership relations as the core
content. The statistics show that in the year of 1993 a great number of experiments
on the joint-stock system were carried out by the state-owned enterprises. By the
end of the year, there were 11,489 joint-stock enterprises with a total capital stock
of 339.666 billion yuan, of which the state shares were 124.76 billion yuan,
accounting for 36.7%, and the legal person shares were 149.76 billion yuan,
accounting for 43.6%. In the same year, the number of listed companies increased
rapidly, from 52 to 182.15 In 1994, 19,847 new joint-stock enterprises appeared in
China, of which 17,456 were limited liability companies and 2391 were incorpo-
rated companies. By the end of 1994, the total number of joint-stock enterprises in
China reached 33,000, an increase of 1.52 times from 1993. In 1995, the State
Council appointed 100 enterprises nationwide to carry out a pilot project of the
modern enterprise system. The project later expanded to include more enterprises
and had the following main contents. (1) Improve the corporate legal person sys-
tem; (2) establish the pilot enterprise as the investment subject (tou zi zhu ti) of
state-owned assets; (3) establish the corporate system as the enterprise’s organi-
zational form; (4) establish scientiﬁc and standardized internal organization and
management structure; (5) reform the enterprise’s personnel system and wage
system; (6) improve the enterprise’s ﬁnancial management system; etc. By 1996, a
total number of 2500 enterprises participated in this pilot project.
During this period, along with the shareholding system reform the state made
another important move, that is, the state began to adopt the strategy of “zhua da
15See Zheng (2008, pp. 36–37).
5.2

133

fang xiao” (focus on the big enterprises and release the small ones) to relax control
over small enterprises and focus on the restructuring of the major enterprises on the
basis of the shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system. This means
that the reform of state-owned enterprises would unfold toward two extremes. From
1995, local governments everywhere began the restructuring of small state-owned
enterprises, using the shareholding cooperative system or various other forms of
restructuring such as leasing, contracting, auction sales, etc., gradually pushing
these enterprises to the market. In this year, the local governments nationwide
began to urge their enterprises to speed up the ﬂow and reorganization of stock
assets through various measures, such as combination, merger, transfer, leasing,
joint capital, sales, etc. As for the big enterprises, there was another initiative, called
the “big company, big group” strategy. 1000 large state-owned key enterprises were
selected for comprehensive reforms, restructuring and transformation. The property
rights relations between the parent companies and subsidiary companies were
normalized; the ties of property rights were improved, so that these large key
enterprises could play a greater role in adjusting and optimizing the industrial
structure, and could be more competitive in the international market. In line with
the above reform strategies, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central
Committee once again stressed that the strategic restructuring of the state-owned
enterprises must be guided by the market and industrial policies; optimization of the
distribution of state-owned assets and optimization of the enterprise organizational
structure must be combined with optimization of the investment structure; prefer-
ential policies should be given to the outstanding and strong enterprises, and only
the ﬁttest can survive; mechanisms of merger, bankruptcy, personnel reduction,
increasing efﬁciency, etc., should be developed; redirection of the superﬂuous
workers should be carried out through multiple channels and making use of mul-
tiple forces including the enterprise, the government and the society; the
non-productive logistics service units and the social service functions should be
gradually separated from the enterprises themselves.
As for the numerous small local enterprises in various localities, those local
governments that were sensitive toward the national policies quickly began to
vigorously transfer, lease, or sell the small and medium state-owned enterprises
under their charge. However, the large and medium-sized enterprises nationwide,
which were not only large in size but also large in number, could not be thoroughly
transformed or corporatized because their local inﬂuence was too big. In the mean
time the country’s administrative support and the banks’ protection gradually
reduced, the situation of these enterprises went from bad to worse. According to
New China Fifty Years’ Government Finance Statistics, the total value of losses and
the percentage of loss-incurring enterprises increased sharply from 1978 to 1998.
The percentage went up from 23.9% in 1978 to 47.4% in 1998, an increase of
23.5% points.16 Judging from the overall situation of the enterprises, especially in
the respects of ﬁnance, management, efﬁciency and staff condition, the state-owned

enterprises were undoubtedly caught in an unprecedented crisis. To meet this new
challenge, in 1997, the state made great improvements in the methods of
state-owned enterprise reform. First, it emphasized the combination of making
breakthroughs at key points and making overall advancement. Second, it empha-
sized that the enterprise reform must be combined with the strategic adjustment of
the national economy. Finally it emphasized that the enterprise reform must be
combined with the comprehensive supplementary reforms.
5.2.2
The Development of Private Enterprises
In the course of 30 years’ reform, the development of China’s private enterprises
has gone through several stages.
At the beginning of the reform, the central authorities proposed that workers
could engage in individual industrial and commercial undertakings, thus opening
the path for a large number of unemployed youth, social idle personnel and rural
surplus personnel to engage in individual businesses in industry and commerce. In
1987, the convening of the 13th National Party Congress and the ratiﬁcation of the
Constitutional Amendment established the legal status of the private economy. The
State Council promulgated the “Provisional Regulations on the Administration of
Individual Industrial and Commercial Households in Urban and Rural Areas” and
the “Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises.” In April 1988, the ﬁrst
meeting of the Seventh Session of the National People’s Congress passed the
Constitutional Amendment, which added the following content. “The State permits
the private sector of the economy to exist and develop within the limits prescribed
by law. The private sector of the economy is a complement to the socialist public
sector of the economy. The State protects the lawful rights and interests of the
private sector of the economy, and exercises guidance, supervision and control over
the private sector of the economy.” Thus the legal status and economic status of the
private economy was established. In June the same year, the State Council pro-
mulgated the “Regulations of the PRC on the Administration of Private
Enterprises,” which started the development of private enterprises. In this period,
the private enterprises were small in size and mainly existed in the forms of
sole-investor enterprises and partnership enterprises.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the 14th National Party Congress announced that
the objective of China’s economic and social reform was to establish the socialist
market economic system, and proposed that the main body of the ownership
structure should be the public ownership economy, including the whole people
ownership and collective ownership economy, while the individual sector, the
private sector and the foreign-invested sector, etc., will have long-term co-existence
with the public sectors. With the establishment of this reform objective, govern-
ments at all levels redoubled their efforts to promote the marketization reform; the
enthusiasm of private investment further heightened; the private economy began to
5.2
Enterprise Restructuring and the Transformation of Ownership …
135

enjoy rapid development; and in accordance with the provisions of the Company
Law the private enterprises established a series of rights structures including
property rights, business operation, etc. In 1997, the 15th National Party Congress
clearly announced that the non-public sectors of the economy were an important
component of China’s socialist market economy. The capital input and output of the
individual and private sectors continued to expand; transformation toward the
modern enterprise system became the main trend of private enterprise development;
a number of private enterprises went on the track of large-scale operation; more and
more high-tech enterprises and export-oriented enterprises appeared; there was
increasing awareness of corporate brand; the role and status of the individual and
private sectors became more and more prominent in the national economy.
From 1992 to 2002, the private sector gradually became a shining new growth
point of the national economy. The number of private enterprises increased from
140,000 to 2,435,000, an increase of 17 times, with the average annual growth rate
at 33%. The total registered capital increased from 22.1 billion yuan to 2475.06
billion yuan, an increase of 112 times, with the average annual growth rate at 60%.
The total number of people working in the private sector increased from 2.32
million to 34.09 million, an increase of nearly 15 times. Taxes increased from 410
million yuan to 97.61 billion yuan, an increase of 208 times, with the average
annual growth rate at 70%. From 1992 to 2002, the number of individual industrial
and commercial households in the whole country increased from 15.43 million to
23.78 million households. Their total amount of funds increased from 60.1 billion
yuan to 378.2 billion yuan. The number of workers increased from 24.68 million to
47.48 million.
The amendment of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China passed by
the Second Plenary Session of the 11th National People’s Congress in 2004 stip-
ulates that “The State protects the lawful rights and interests of the non-public
sectors of the economy such as the individual and private sectors of the economy.
The State encourages, supports and guides the development of the non-public
sectors of the economy and, in accordance with law, exercises supervision and
control over the non-public sectors of the economy.” In 2005, the State Council
promulgated “Several Opinions of the State Council on Encouraging, Supporting
and Guiding the Development of Individual and Private Economy and Other
Non-Public Sectors of the Economy.” This was the ﬁrst-ever central government
document themed on promoting the development of China’s non-public economy
since the founding of new China. By 2007, the number of private enterprises in
China increased to 5.15 million, the number of individual industrial and commercial
households in China increased to 27.415 million. Private enterprises accounted for
61% of the total number of enterprises in China, outnumbering all other types. The
average registered capital of the private enterprises increased by 69,117 yuan to
93,873 yuan from 2002 to 2007, an increase of 279%. The total amount of funds of
the individual industrial and commercial households increased to 735.07 billion
yuan, an increase of 356.87 billion yuan or 94 percent from 2002. The proﬁts of
private industrial enterprises above designated size increased from 49 billion yuan
136
5
The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

in 2002 to 400 billion yuan in 2007, an increase of about 8 times in ﬁve years, the
average annual growth rate being 52%.17
According to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics, as of the third
quarter of 2007, China’s registered private enterprises have reached 5.387 million
in number, with the total registered capital standing at 8800 billion yuan. The total
number of people working in the private sector reached 70.58 million, among them
13.621 million were investors. Currently, the private sector accounts for about 65%
of China’s GDP, offering about 2/3 of China’s total number of jobs. The private
enterprises have become the main body of the economy in the majority of China’s
cities and counties. 70% of the local revenues depend on the private enterprises.
The real starting point of the rapid development of the private enterprises over three
decades was the socialist market economic system reform. Deng Xiaoping’s
southern talks in 1992 and the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China
promulgated at the end of 1993 made thorough preparations for the development
pattern of the private economy with market and capital as the core, and corporate
governance structure as the basis.
The establishment of the modern enterprise system served as an important basis
for the expansion and development of the enterprises in the marketization reform
which was gaining momentum. Firstly, corporatization of the enterprises clearly
established the status of the independent legal person. All other institutions and
organizational structures are formulated around this legal person who possesses
civil rights. Secondly, from this starting point the property rights relations of the
enterprise were also clariﬁed. The investor’s stock rights over corporate legal
person properties, that is, the ownership rights over the company’s properties, as
well as the voting right in the shareholders’ general meeting and the right to claim
surplus revenues, were all protected by law. In the mean time, the ﬁduciary rela-
tionship between the shareholders’ general meeting and the board of directors, as
well as the principal-agent relationship between the board and the company man-
ager, were all clearly deﬁned.18 This marketization reform for the ﬁrst time
established the status of the legal person, the legitimacy of individual property
rights, as well as the proper structure of enterprise rights and obligations in the legal
sense. The fuzzy property rights under the original collective system (whether in
township enterprises or state-owned enterprises) were thoroughly clariﬁed, the still
unclear parts were gradually removed. In this sense, the rights of the investor, or the
rights of capital, now enjoyed a great degree of legal protection under the market
economy. As a result, the legitimacy of capital and the status of capital in the entire
product market, sales market, ﬁnancial market and labor market were also
established.
After the tax-sharing system reform in particular, the government no longer
dominated the day-to-day management and operation of the enterprises, but exerted
inﬂuence through taxation and levying fees. The local governments began

transforming township enterprises and state-owned enterprises into private enter-
prises on a large scale, “selling enterprises” became a common practice. Whether it
was the local state-owned enterprises, or the township enterprises, they all became
the targets of merger, transfer, lease and offering for sale. The establishment of the
legal person status of the enterprise in the sense of property rights and the reor-
ganization and transformation of the enterprises towards the modern enterprise
system were undoubtedly conducive to enterprise operation in accordance with the
principle of efﬁciency. Moreover, the power of capitalization also became stronger
and stronger, with the withdrawal of the government and the effective participation
of private capital and foreign capital. The weakening of the enterprise-government
connection, on the one hand, enhanced the enterprises’ independent property rights
and autonomy in business operation. On the other hand, the enterprises no longer
enjoyed government protection, and must adapt to ﬁerce market competition, that
is, the survival of the ﬁttest. As to the township enterprises, only those enterprises
that had clear property rights relations and comparatively higher core competi-
tiveness could accelerate their development by taking advantage of the favorable
environment of marketization. Most of the enterprises which had gained a living
space due to local government protection were faced with the destiny of elimina-
tion. At this time, a large number of state-owned enterprises were facing great
difﬁculties. A Chinese idiom says, “problems accumulated over the years cannot be
resolved overnight.” These enterprises were burdened with the enormous pressure
of providing social welfare for the workers, their relatives, and even the sur-
rounding communities; they also had other serious problems including overstafﬁng,
low efﬁciency, aggravation of ﬁnance, etc.; moreover, the tax-sharing system
reform had exposed them naked under the supervision and control of the central
ﬁscal and taxation departments.

caused the social structure to undergo profound changes. On the one hand, the local
governments adopted the approach of “retaining water to raise ﬁsh” to stimulate
economic growth through investment, so that the size and quantity of enterprises
increased sharply. On the other hand, with the corporatization and transformation of
property rights relations of the enterprises, the performance of the social economy
began to follow the logic of capital; the market ideology began to gain the approval
of the whole society. The initial marriage of power and capital had led to an
overheating of the national economy. After that, with the introduction of the ﬁscal
tax-sharing system, the decentralization policy since the 1980s was changed into
138

centralization again. This adjustment of the ﬁscal and taxation structure, on the one
hand, brought the dual-track system in the early stage to an end. On the other hand,
it also made the local governments lose enthusiasm in setting up enterprises.
Instead, they made efforts to win special transfer payments from the central gov-
ernment, or began to explore new ways of making proﬁts.
In the central and western regions, because most township enterprises went
through restructuring or became bankrupt, the local governments, especially the
governments at county and township levels, began to face ﬁnancial crises. When
the local governments tried to shift their ﬁnancial crises onto the peasants through
various means, the aggravating burden of the peasants became a serious problem.
Many empirical studies have shown that since the mid-1990s, the peasants’ burden
has become a major social problem in the rural areas of the central and western
regions, it even had a serious impact on social stability in some areas. The increase
in peasants’ burden was due to the fact that the tax-sharing system reform had
changed the ﬁscal structure of the county and township governments. For those
areas in the central and western regions that could not invent new government
revenue channels, the ﬁscal crisis would naturally lead to the decline and desolation
of the rural communities.
In the eastern regions, the large number of laid-off workers caused by the
enterprise restructuring, as well as the large number of migrant workers who were
attracted to the cities by the rise of the private sector and the tertiary industry,
brought about some very difﬁcult social problems. Due to the implementation of the
urban housing system reform in the late 1990s, the construction of industrial parks
for the private enterprises, and the inﬂux of foreign capital, urban development land
became a scarce resource. The Land Administration Law, which was revised in
1998, provided an institutional basis for the conversion of rural land into urban
development land. From the end of the 1990s, under the combined inﬂuence of
these factors, a wave of urbanization ofﬁcially began. The expansion of the cities
has become the main content of reform over the past decade, which opened up a
new gate to riches for the local governments in the eastern regions. Compared with
the wave of industrialization in the ﬁrst 15 years of reform, this wave of urban-
ization brought even greater wealth to the local governments, but this was achieved
at the cost of “depriving” the land of the peasants through institutional means. At
this point, the local governments’ behavior had undergone a complete change.
Whether in the eastern or in the central and western regions, the development
strategy of “retaining water to raise ﬁsh” began to change toward “draining the
pond to catch all the ﬁsh.” The social wealth was increasingly concentrated to the
hands of a few through the marriage of power and market, the gap between the rich
and the poor gradually widened.19
19According to a survey by Zhao Renwei and Li Shi, the Gini coefﬁcient of the per capita income
of urban and rural residents in 1988 was 0.382 (see Zhao et al. 1994). According to Li Qiang’s
study, the Gini coefﬁcient of the per capita income of urban and rural residents in 1994 rose to the
level of 0.434. From 1996 to 1997, it climbed to 0.4577. It is estimated that the Gini coefﬁcient
after 2000 has maintained at a level of no less than 0.5 (see Qiang 2006).

The Formation of Market-Oriented Labor Relations
139

With the market-oriented reforms, the allocation of the means of production and
the allocation of labor increasingly followed the logic of capital. When recruiting
workers, the private enterprises no longer aimed at the local villages for rural
surplus labor, and the local governments no longer adopted the principle of pri-
oritizing local employment in expanding the size and quantity of enterprises. On the
contrary, the ﬂow of rural surplus labor from the inland began to go beyond the
scope of the SEZs, and head for all locations of capital investment in the pattern of
seeking lowest costs. In addition, after the tax-sharing system reform, the sponta-
neous momentum of system change within the rural areas weakened, the state’s
investment in the rural areas also reduced the original state-owned enterprises and
township enterprises either went through restructuring or disintegrated. As a result,
the power of the various ties binding the rural labor force to the rural communities
was greatly weakened. The mighty torrent of rural surplus labor began to ﬂow from
the west to the east, from the north to the south on the vast land of China, and
became an unprecedented phenomenon in the process of China’s modernization.
The movement of migrant workers in the 1990s thoroughly changed the foun-
dation of the rural social structure that had been restored in the 1980s through the
implementation of the land contract system. The exodus of large numbers of young
and middle-aged adults resulted in the loss of key members of the families in the
vast countryside, the harm of which was no less than the disintegration of the family
unit. Although the migration of rural labor force made great contributions to eco-
nomic development, it also incurred great costs in maintaining the stability of the
social structure. The outﬂow of the main labor force of the rural areas marked the
victory of capital in the process of marketization. However, it also led to the
collapse of the core foundation of agricultural production and rural community life,
resulting in the desolation of the rural society and economy.
It can be said that the establishment of the ideology and basic consensus about
“the economy coming ﬁrst,” as well as the changes in the government’s ways of
economic intervention, not only increased the strength and expanded the scope of
capital operation, and promoted the growth of the national economy, but also
caused the government’s proﬁt-seeking behaviors to become more secretive. With
the increasing prosperity of the market economy, the extra-institutional ﬂow of
resources which were not subject to government control increased signiﬁcantly. The
government’s role gradually changed from one that controlled and distributed
resources into one that occupied and retained resources, thus greatly increasing the
peasants’ burden.
With the advancement of market-oriented reforms, labor problems began to
present themselves on a large scale. Firstly, the rise of the private sector and the
emergence of large numbers of private enterprises began to make enterprise
operation follow the pattern of rent-seeking of capital, especially in the aspect of
labor employment. All kinds of non-public-ownership enterprises, especially those
labor-intensive manufacturing and processing enterprises, no longer gave priority to
the local surplus labor force when recruiting workers, which had been the practice
of the original township enterprises. Instead, they followed the principle of lowest
labor costs, and recruited workers from the rural areas of the vast interior. The rural
140
5
The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

surplus labor from the interior were cheap in price, large in number, and had
nothing attached, that is, they had no social system protection, no legal support, nor
did they have the protection of any local community. As a result, a remarkable
phenomenon of large-scale labor force migration took place, i.e., the ﬂow of
“migrant workers” that people often talked about. Secondly, another reason why
this type of labor force had the lowest costs was that the enterprises did not need to
bear much social responsibility for their employment; their costs rarely included the
costs of education in the past, or the costs of old-age pension, social insurance and
labor training.
In 1992, with the establishment of the market economic system, 40 million rural
migrant workers suddenly rushed into the cities. Due to the dualist separation effect
of the household registration system, the cities basically adopted the approach of
“economic absorption, social exclusion” toward these migrant workers. The num-
ber of migrant workers working in the cities reached 46 million in 1992, and went
up to 60 million in 1994. Since then, the number of migrant workers increased
annually by 8 million to 10 million, reaching 120 million by the end of the 1990s.20
In the 21st century, as China became the most important region to bear international
manufacturing transfer, the number of migrant workers continued to grow steadily.
The migrant workers in this period exhibited the characteristics of long-term stay in
the cities and loss of rural social identity.
From the perspective of overall socio-economic structure, the ﬂow of migrant
workers could be partly attributed to the internal factors of the rural areas, such as
the worsening shortage of farmland, lack of agricultural investment and increased
burden of farmers. However, the major causes were the dualist urban-rural social
structure and the compelling force of capital unleashed by market-oriented reforms.
According to some economists, the population ﬂow basically depended on the
expected difference between urban and rural income.21 The ratio of per capita net
income between urban and rural areas in China increased from 1.72 in 1985 to 2.54
in 1993, then to 3.31 in 2002. The revolution in the private sector of the economy in
the 1990s enhanced the attractiveness of capital to surplus labor. Capital began to
go beyond the constraints of systems, regions and institutions to absorb large
amounts of cheap labor in the way of cost optimization.
First of all, the household registration system as the urban-rural regime gover-
nance structure was one of the causes of the ﬂow of migrant workers. Although
market-oriented reforms treated the migrant workers as subjects of labor contracts
under the contract system, fundamentally speaking, the migrant workers did not
break away from their original identity of rural household registration, and still
possessed features deﬁned by the overall status system in the sense of urban-rural
separation. The social mobility of the migrant workers was limited to the movement
of labor that followed the direction of capital, and did not have any features of
upward mobility. In short, the migrant workers could not obtain non-agricultural
20“Statistical Bulletin of the National Bureau of Statistics (2003)”.

5.3

141

identity on their own. Secondly, because of the differences in the governance
system, the migrant workers were denied many rights that the urban workers were
entitled to. The state workers enjoyed various rights in the state-owned enterprises;
the urban workers in the private enterprises also enjoyed some rights; even the
workers in the individual sector had various minimum rights of the urban citizen.
These rights ranged from voting rights in politics to various rights concerning social
welfare. However, none of these rights were enjoyed by the migrant workers. In the
sense of universal citizenship, there was also difference in the urban and rural
structures of rights, which had directly inﬂuence on the empowerment condition of
the migrant workers in the enterprise organization.
Therefore, from the perspective of regime governance, the social exclusion of
the migrant workers was inevitable. Whether it was the signing of labor contracts,
or the beneﬁts of labor protection, or the minimum social security in urban com-
munities, the majority of migrant workers were excluded from all these. In concrete
labor processes, abundant records show that the migrant workers were given
extremely harsh treatment, from the recruitment conditions to the working condi-
tions, from wage distribution to labor safety. As most labor-intensive private
enterprises, small and medium-sized individual proprietorship enterprises, joint
ventures adopted the piece-rate wage system, the decisions on labor intensity and
wage standards did not have strict criteria or a supervision mechanism, and were
made almost exclusively by the business owners. Many companies turned into
“sweatshops,” where workers worked more than 12 h a day, at extremely high labor
intensity. Holding down the workers’ wages became the enterprise owners’ main
method to reduce production costs. The existence of numerous cases of wage
arrears precisely indicated that the deprivation of rights of the migrant workers was
structural.
To sum up, in the majority of the private enterprises, it was difﬁcult to protect the
rights of migrant workers. Various types of worker participation, whether technical,
or labor-related, or even political, that were commonly seen in the state-owned
enterprises almost never happened in the private enterprises. The migrant workers
in the private enterprises were often captured in a state of sheer exploitation to be
found only in the primitive accumulation of capital. Many private enterprises only
employed workers aged between 18 and 30, ages of the best working ability. These
enterprises could start employment at any time, also could ﬁre the workers at any
time. They were never burdened with pre-employment education and training costs,
nor did they pay for the workers’ old-age pension. They did not even give the
workers compensation for labor accidents within the employment period. In gen-
eral, the private enterprises managed the workers strictly in accordance with the
logic of capital coercion. The workers were only used as a labor tool. They did not
have proper channels for safeguarding their own interests, let alone any form of
democratic participation in corporate affairs such as the workers’ assembly. The
workers just did their jobs for survival.

5.3.2
Crisis of the State-Owned Enterprises and Worker
Layoffs
In the mid-1990s, the primary driving force behind the wave of state-owned
enterprise restructuring was not really the marketization process. It can be said that
market integration not only brought bursting vitality to China’s private economy,
but also exposed many deﬁciencies of the state-owned enterprises. However, before
the reform of the central and local taxation system, the state-owned enterprises often
served as the battleﬁeld for the policy games between the local governments and the
higher-level departments, and even served as a platform for seeking parasitic loans.
The centralization reform of the tax-sharing ﬁscal system greatly weakened the
bargaining ability of the local governments, and narrowed down the operating space
of collusion between local governments and local tax departments. This major
initiative of the central government completely changed the dubious relationship
between the local governments and the enterprises, removed the essence of
enterprise-government afﬁliation, and weakened the strength of local protectionism.
In the mean time, the local governments no longer had enough motivation to seek
proﬁts through running enterprises.22
The broad masses of workers in the state-owned enterprises encountered another
crisis during this period. As mentioned above, in the middle and late 1990s, large
numbers of state-owned enterprises incurred heavy losses, could not make ends
meet, and even became insolvent. Some enterprises not only lacked funds for
production input and technical transformation, but also delayed payment of the
workers’ wages year after year. The reasons were as follows. Firstly, large
state-owned enterprises, which had enjoyed industrial monopolies in the past, now
lost their competitive advantage in the marketization reform due to the fast
development of private enterprises; they no longer had the leverage to bargain with
the government. Secondly, because the government rarely made subsidized input,
and the banks no longer provided guarantee services, the state-owned enterprises
got into the predicament of capital chain rupture, shortage in production, and
lagging sales. For many large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, because
their market risk was too large, and their impact on the country’s and the local
region’s social stability was also too large, the central and local governments could
not decide what to do with them. Whether to sell them, or to take them over, or to
protect them, none of these were deemed suitable. These enterprises remained
paralyzed for years. The only way for them to prolong their survival was to target
on the enterprise workers, to adopt the approach of worker layoffs.23
22See Zhou (2008).
23At the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee in September 1999, the
“Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning the Reform and
Development of State-owned Enterprises” (hereinafter referred to as the “Decision”) was passed. It
pointed out that the state should establish a competitive mechanism for the enterprises following
the principle of “survival of the ﬁttest,” should encourage mergers, set standards for the bankruptcy
5.3

143

Facing this situation, almost at the same time with the introduction of the
tax-sharing system reform, the small and medium-sized cities in the coastal areas,
which had a keen “sense of smell,” began to restructure their state-owned enter-
prises basically along the path of privatization. However, large and medium-sized
enterprises in the inland, which were over-burdened and debt-ridden, waited for
more radical restructuring measures to be taken by the central government. The
actual result was quite tragic. Some enterprises were forced to go bankrupt. Some
others laid off large numbers of workers by giving them only a small payment of
buy-out compensation, and forcefully changed the workers’ status system, a labor
governance system under the original danwei system, to the employment contract
system. For the broad masses of state-owned enterprise workers, this change was
too abrupt, causing too much turbulence. They lost their system status which for
decades had ensured them state protection; they lost the guarantee of welfare for a
lifetime, and instantly became unemployed, the living conditions being not much
different from the refugees’. No wonder it was difﬁcult for them to accept this
tremendous change whether in economic, or political, or psychological terms. Since
the mid-1990s, with the large-scale implementation of enterprise restructuring, the
tide of marketization swept through all ﬁelds of China’s social economy. The
dual-track system in economic operation and resource allocation was essentially
replaced by the market-oriented mechanism; capital became the dominant factor in
the pattern of beneﬁt distribution. The government faded out from the front stage of
economic operation and resource allocation, while the market seemed to increas-
ingly become a source of justice and legitimacy of beneﬁt distribution.
Enterprise ownership restructuring and corporatization also had great impact on
the internal governance structure of the enterprises. With corporatization being
carried out, the principle of corporate legal person was ﬁrmly established; a clear
property rights structure in the legal sense was also established; the fuzzy rights
relations of the original dual-track system were removed; the original bureaucratic
characteristics of the state-owned enterprises were also removed; the collective
ownership system no longer had any role to play in enterprise organization. Once
the legal person with clear owner status was “cut out” from the original system, the
right to control in terms of possession and management was passed onto the hands
of the property owner, and the enterprise was no longer subject to the direct or
indirect control of any superior administrative departments. Thus, the establishment
of clear property rights produced important results. First, capital rights were
combined in accordance with market allocation; second, the enterprise must set
process, redirect laid-off workers, increase efﬁciency by downsizing staff, and undertake reem-
ployment projects. The “Decision” also pointed out that the laying off and repositioning of workers
should be compatible with the national ﬁnancial condition and social affordability. To support
these measures, the state should adjust the structure of ﬁscal expenditure, and ensure there is
enough funding by committing the enterprises, the society and the government. The ﬁnancial
departments should guarantee enough funding if the enterprises could not afford, or socially raised
funds are not enough. The state should further improve the basic living security of laid-off
workers, unemployment insurance, and the subsistence allowance system for urban residents.
144

The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

clear proﬁt goals; third, the principles of maximizing proﬁts and efﬁciency coming
ﬁrst were established; fourth, the enterprise must readjust its internal management
in accordance with these goals and principles, and achieve capital accumulation
with the approach of optimal allocation; ﬁfth, the law became an important means
of self protection for the enterprise organization; sixth, the enterprise began to
deﬁne its members in terms of resource, that is, the workers were included in the
resource structure as human resource.
At the same time, in order to completely cast off the burden of corporate welfare
on government ﬁnance under the planned economy, the State Council promulgated
the “Decision on Deepening Urban Housing Reform” in 1994, changing the
housing welfare distribution mode from the original material distribution to mon-
etary distribution on the basis of labor. The introduction of this policy opened the
door to the commercialization of urban housing, marking the beginning of China’s
all-round housing market reform, which incorporated the policy of “socialization of
welfare” into the privatization of housing. Since then, similar reforms have been
carried out in the ﬁelds of social security and welfare that were closely related to the
national economy and the people’s livelihood in the traditional planned economy.
Education, health care and social security were all included on the agenda of the
all-round marketization reform. The main types of welfare concerning urban resi-
dents all changed gradually from “pay by the government” to “pay on one’s own” at
market prices.
The all-round marketization reform went far beyond the scope of capital,
extending into all aspects of the people’s livelihood. Within a few short years the
urban residents’ life was placed in a completely unforeseen marketized situation.
From the long-term point of view, the marketization of social welfare could thor-
oughly overcome the drawbacks of the danwei system, and add depth to the
marketization reform through the transformation of durable goods consumption
structure. However, because this sudden all-round marketization reform involved
almost all aspects of the people’s livelihood, and this was combined with the effects
of enterprise restructuring such as worker layoffs, it indeed had a great impact on
ordinary people’s life expectations. More importantly, the imbalance in the con-
sumer expectations, the limited increase in the residents’ income and the widening
gap between the rich and the poor, etc., produced negative effects on the domestic
demand structure, and hindered economic growth. In the face of extremely weak
domestic demand, the central government must once again ﬁnd a breakthrough
point in economic development and bring about signiﬁcant changes in social and
economic structure.
As to the labor relations within the enterprises, the imitation of the modern
enterprise system in the respect of staff governance was embodied in labor contract
governance, which no longer resorted to participation mechanisms like the workers’
congress system of the state-owned enterprises. Therefore, in some new private
enterprises, and even in local state-owned enterprises after the transformation, the
workers’ congress system gradually disappeared, replaced by a model of human
resource management with collective contracts. Generally, the workers’ rights
concerning the minimum wages, labor protection and so on were delineated in
5.3
The Formation of Market-Oriented Labor Relations
145

accordance with the industry’s standards of minimum rights protection. In the mean
time, a labor contract was signed by the workers and the enterprises according to
each enterprise’s own characteristics and requirements. Compared with the past,
one of the most evident advantages of contract management was that there were
laws to abide by. The Labor Law of the People’s Republic of China was pro-
mulgated in July 1994, just the right time to meet the needs of enterprise restruc-
turing. It included clear provisions on labor contracts and collective contracts,
working hours and vacations, wages, labor safety and health care, special protection
of female and underage workers, professional training, social insurance and welfare,
labor disputes, etc. The basic rights of workers were now set down in the form of
law. In this sense, the broad masses of enterprise workers for the ﬁrst time had legal
weapons to use in safeguarding their own rights.
As supporting measures of the implementation of the Labor Law, a number of
legal services and legal aid institutions related to labor relations were set up in
China, which played a very important role of social support when the workers used
the weapon of law to safeguard their rights. However, the model of human resource
management within the framework of the Labor Law also had a dilemma. On the
one hand, at the same time when the Company Law established the governance of
the corporate legal person and its rights structure, the Labor Law also clearly
deﬁned the rights and obligations of the workers, established a legal basis for the
workers’ rights, and provided relevant legal channels. On the other hand, because in
labor relations the labor contracts broke down the whole groups of workers under
the whole people ownership and collective ownership systems into individual
workers, in the process of safeguarding their rights, the workers could only use the
law as atomized individual persons, which was technically complex and pro-
hibitively costly for individuals. Moreover, when they resorted to legal means to
resolve rights disputes they could only point at individual events that had happened
to themselves. As to the widespread violations within the enterprise or the industry,
it was difﬁcult to form group forces to carry out mass struggle. In fact, when the
model of human resource management replaced the group participation of workers,
the whole groups of workers were broken up into individuals, making it difﬁcult for
them to form group forces and carry out effective collective bargaining and col-
lective action to exert pressure on the employer. The effects of this change on social
contradictions would gradually present themselves in the following years.
Despite the enactment of the Labor Law, the wave of worker layoffs was still on
the rise. According to the ofﬁcial documents of that period, the so-called “laid-off
workers” referred to those workers who had not held a work position in the original
enterprise for over three months due to unfavorable production and business con-
ditions, had not got resettlement or become re-employed, and had not terminated
labor relations with the original enterprise. The repositioned workers had two types:
enterprise-repositioned workers and society-repositioned workers. Enterprise-
repositioned workers referred to those workers whose work and life problems
were resolved by the enterprise through a variety of internal channels, including
enterprise-run economic entities, labor service exports, pensioning off, etc.; they
continued to hold labor relations with the enterprise. Society-repositioned workers
146
5
The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

referred to those workers who got resettled outside the enterprise through various
channels, including being accepted by another danwei, self-employment, early
retirement, etc.; these workers had terminated labor relations with the original
enterprise.24
According to a national survey conducted by the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security in 1997 on all state-owned enterprises, in 1997 alone, the total number of
laid-off workers and repositioned workers in the state-owned enterprises nationwide
(excluding Xizang) reached 12.742 million, accounting for 17.2% of the total
number of workers in these enterprises at the beginning of the year. Among them,
the repositioned workers were 6.398 million, accounting for 50.2%; the laid-off
workers were 6.343 million, accounting for 49.8%. Among all the 6.398 million
repositioned
workers,
enterprise-repositioned
workers
were
4.109
million,
accounting for 64.2%. Among all enterprise-repositioned workers, 1.083 million
went to enterprise-run economic entities, accounting for 26.4%; 44.1 million tried
labor exports, accounting for 10.7%; 1.325 million were pensioned off, accounting
for 32.2%; 1.259 million resorted to other means, accounting for 30.7%. Among all
the 6.398 million repositioned workers, society-repositioned workers were 2.29
million, accounting for 35.8%. Among all society-repositioned workers, 373,000
were accepted by another danwei, accounting for 16.3%; 1.179 million were
self-employed, accounting for 51.5%; 350,000 had early retirement, accounting for
15.3%; 388,000 resorted to other means, accounting for 16.9%. Among all the
6.334 million laid-off workers, 715,000 entered re-employment service centers,
accounting for 11.3%; 5.628 million did not enter re-employment service centers,
accounting for 88.7%. Among those laid-off workers who did not enter
re-employment service centers, 3.095 million did not receive the subsistence
allowance for laid-off workers, accounting for 55%.25
It cannot be denied that the partial revival of the state-owned enterprises after
2000 was achieved at the cost of a certain kind of “deprivation” of large numbers of
enterprise workers in the end of the 1990s. If not counting the deprivation of
peasants for industrial accumulation, this was the ﬁrst large-scale deprivation of
urban workers after the founding of the People’s Republic of China. In fact, the
central government’s policy of “reducing staff to improve efﬁciency” concealed a
basic thesis, that is, “reducing staff” was the precondition of “improving efﬁciency,”
and was thus the primary approach for the state-owned enterprises to continue their
own survival in hopeless situations.
The ﬁrst difﬁculty faced by the restructuring of state-owned enterprises and the
laying off and repositioning of workers was the question of rights in public own-
ership enterprises. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the state-owned
enterprise workers were the legitimate owners of the state-owned enterprises; they
had the status of rights subject (quan li zhu ti) in the enterprise; they were state

re-employing laid-off workers.” (Guo (1998) No. 28).

workers in the sense of state agency. After the enterprise restructuring, corporate
governance was based on the legal person; the enterprise manager became the legal
agent, which made the status of the enterprise workers become fuzzy. Their
ownership rights which were clearly deﬁned under the public ownership system
were now blurred; the workers were no longer the rights subject of the enterprise in
its full sense. In this sense, all the decisions related to reducing staff and laying off
workers in the state-owned enterprises were made without the participation of the
rights subject, i.e., the workers, but were announced and executed through the
mandates of higher-level administrative departments or the resolutions of the cor-
porate legal person. Because these important decisions which were related to the
people’s livelihood generally did not go through the democratic process, the vast
number of laid-off workers lost their jobs without having exercised their rights, and
had every reason to become immensely discontented. Upholding their status as state
workers, they have kept their right of recourse toward the state agent. From the late
1990s to the early 2000s, laid-off workers from various parts of country set off a
“wave of petition visits,” which was an exhibition of this right of recourse.26
Due to enterprise restructuring, the state-owned enterprise workers not only lost
their original welfare beneﬁts, but also lost their career and work which they had
retained for decades as state workers. This change in status from enterprise owners
to wandering refugees was too abrupt and forceful. Moreover, when the govern-
ment and the enterprises gave compensation to the laid-off workers, there were no
legal standards to follow. The enterprise workers often fell into the plight of
unemployment only in return for a small sum of buy-out compensation. Compared
with the average disposable income at the time, this sum of buy-out compensation
was too small in quantity. Not only that, only a small part of all the laid-off workers
received it, and the actual payment was often delayed. In fact, the so-called
“buy-out” meant that the status of “state worker” ofﬁcially ended. This was true not
only for the laid-off workers, but also for the workers who retained their work. The
real signiﬁcance of laying off workers lies in the fact that all the workers, whether
26At the end of 2005, the State Council promulgated on behalf of the SASAC (the State-Owned
Assets Supervision and Administration Commission) “Opinions on Implementing Further
Regulation of SOE Restructuring.” (hereinafter referred to as the “Opinions”), which had strict
stipulations concerning the rights and responsibilities in the resettlement of workers. Here are some
of its stipulations. Before the implementation of restructuring, the original enterprise and the
investors should clarify relevant responsibilities and devise a program for the resettlement of
workers including aspects such as resettlement costs, taking over of labor relations, etc. The
resettlement program must be examined and approved by the workers’ congress or the workers’
general assembly. The resettlement program must be announced to the masses of the workers in

The Labor-Capital Relations in the Marketization Reform

laid-off or still in position, were deprived of their lifelong status and rights; they all
became employed workers under the contract system.
In this process, the state failed to establish a rather complete social security
system in support of enterprise restructuring. In addition, the laid-off workers were
mostly old workers who had little technical expertise, and little chance of getting
re-employed. Some workers had lost their labor ability due to ill health or work
injuries, and were immediately plunged into extreme poverty. In particular, the
extra large state-owned enterprises faced even greater difﬁculties, because their
industrial structure and the industrial structure of the local cities and communities
were superimposed together. Similar to the industrialization process in 18th-century
Europe, this caused widespread poverty over large areas of urban communities. Due
to the great burden of national and local government ﬁnance, as well the inability of
the original enterprises to make compensations, a large number of problems arose,
and has remained unsolved until today.
Because in the early stages of the reform most state-owned enterprises once
existed as a mixture of the state ownership system and the collective ownership
system, there were also two types of worker status, the whole people system worker
and the collective system worker. In the process of laying off and repositioning
workers, the whole people system workers still enjoyed a certain degree of pro-
tection by state policies, while the collective system workers were generally treated
in a different way. They seldom succeeded in getting compensations, and often
were the ﬁrst group to be deprived of rights and beneﬁts. In the process of laying off
and repositioning workers, the collective system workers, strictly speaking, did not
receive similar treatments with the whole people system workers whose status more
or less entitled them to some compensation. The so-called “big collective workers”
were often directly denied such a state status in the implementation of “reducing
staff to improve efﬁciency.”
The survival of the state-owned enterprises in the crisis relied to a great extent on
sacriﬁcing the workers’ rights and opportunities of employment, on the change of
the workers’ status from the public ownership system to the contract system, on
sacriﬁcing the social welfare and social security of the broad masses of laid-off
workers. Moreover, in the last few years of the 1990s, the state carried out the
all-round marketization reform in various important ﬁelds concerning the national
economy and the people’s livelihood, such as housing, education, health care, old
age pension, etc., which further intensiﬁed the subsistence crisis of the laid-off
workers. It can be said that this restructuring of the state-owned enterprises not only
negated the history of the state-owned enterprises, but also cut off the laid-off
workers from their future.
In conclusion, China’s rapid economic growth in the 1990s was inseparable
from the property rights restructuring of the enterprise organizations and the
ensuing all-round construction of the modern enterprise management system.
However, the costs were also great. Although the victory of capital effectively
promoted economic growth, organizational improvement and system innovation, it
resulted in enormous deprivation of the rural migrant workers and the urban
workers in both policy and capital. Moreover, the internal changes of the enterprise

organizations severely weakened the workers’ collective negotiating power, and
obstructed the development of group awareness among the workers, which resulted
in the accumulation of potential social contradictions.

Social Construction and the Governance
of Labor Relations
At the end of 2001, China ﬁnally joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) after
a tortuous and prolonged process of negotiations. This landmark event indicated,
ﬁrst of all, that China’s economic growth model had undergone a major change.
China would now increase its GDP through integration with the global economic
order, and through the development of manufacturing industry and foreign trade.
Secondly, with China’s participation in the global capital and market distribution
system, China’s social-economic structures began to reshape following the logic of
capital, resulting in a widening gap in domestic social distribution and a new round
of social problems with labor-capital relations at the core. In addition, in the process
of being geared to international standards, although China pursued standardization
and technicalization in enterprise operation, in the construction of the rule of law, in
governance and administration, the basic layout of China’s power structure was not
changed. The rent-seeking behavior of power was not eliminated, but became more
indirect, more structuralized. Finally, China did not play a purely passive role in its
globalization process. On the contrary, this process became China’s new form of
involvement in global politics and economy, through increasing involvement in the
international capital market, through overseas investment, acquisitions and mergers,
etc. At the same time, as China’s social development entered a deep-water zone,
changing the economic growth model, adjusting the methods of governance,
improving the people’s living standards and balancing the pattern of interests
became the key issues in the third stage of China’s reform.

6.1.1
Development Pattern Under the Condition
of Global Capital
China’s social development had depended on the push of economic growth. This
model encountered two major challenges in the late 1990s, the ﬁrst being the impact
of the Asian ﬁnancial crisis, the second being the difﬁculties caused by enterprise
restructuring and the all-round marketization reform in housing, education, health
care, old-age pension and so on. Although the former did not inﬂict direct damages
on China’s ﬁnance, it mounted huge pressures on China in the aspects of invest-
ment, trade, consumption and employment. As to the latter, although these radical
market-oriented reforms aimed rather accurately at the weak points of China’s
economic development, they shifted all social responsibilities onto the shoulders of
the common people, which produced great shocks in the people’s livelihood, and
led to the co-existence of high savings rate and low consumption. Because China’s
marketization reform at ﬁrst adopted the strategy of “government promotion, and
giving priority to capital,” the economic growth was most distinctly felt in the
accumulation of capital, but did not beneﬁt the general population on a large scale.
In addition, the structure of production was dominated by labor-intensive industries,
which mostly employed rural surplus labor. As a result, the people’s income level
was not improved at the same rate with the economic growth; the comprehensive
expected income did not rise but fell. In this sense, the economic growth could not
rely on the lasting push of domestic demand.
Since the SEZs experiment in the 1980s and Deng Xiaoping’s southern talks in
early 1990s, China has gradually implemented a bold policy of capital market
liberalization to utilize foreign capital. Particularly after joining the WTO in 2001,
foreign investment gained further momentum in boosting China’s economic
growth. From the beginning of the reform and opening up to present, China has
attracted a total of 700 billion US dollars of foreign capital. In 2004, 57% of China’s
foreign trade, both import and export, were contributed by foreign-funded enter-
prises. In the same time, the dependence degree of China’s GDP on foreign trade
increased rapidly, reaching above 70% in 2004.1 In the 21st century, China greatly
improved its market openness and became the ﬁrst choice of international capital.
There were some unique reasons for this. The ﬁrst was that the government became
the core driving force for attracting foreign investment and opening up the market.
Secondly, China’s cheap labor had a very strong comparative advantage when
participating in international division of labor. Thirdly, the enterprises which went
through enterprise restructuring and survived the marketization reform in the 1990s
rapidly established a corporate governance structure that could adapt to brutal
market competition, and directly transformed into terminal workshops in the global

value chain. Finally, the strong administrative power of the Chinese government
helped to control the various social contradictions generated by the exploitation of
international capital, and could quickly transform and adjust the whole economic
structure through a centralized approach.
Another factor that contributed to China’s transformation into the “world fac-
tory” was the favorable conditions provided by the international ﬁnancial and
political
order.
According
to
Gao’s
research,
the
conditions
for
China’s
export-oriented economy to develop were ﬁrstly rooted in the Dollar Standard of
the international ﬁnancial system. Fundamentally speaking, “without the Dollar
Standard, there would be no global production.” Without the Dollar Standard, the
United States would not have given up the manufacturing industry, and change the
core of its national economy into ﬁnance and services; it would not have transferred
the processing trade and its associated productions to foreign countries; it would not
have established a debt-based consumption structure; and the cross-border ﬂows of
capital would not have been possible.2 It is in this sense that international capital,
the international consumer market, the internal marketization forcefully introduced
by the Chinese government, as well as the low-cost labor force formed by the
distribution gap in the 1990s, together constituted the preconditions and core
competitiveness for China to become the “world factory.”
From 2001 to 2004, China’s “world factory” was basically positioned at the low
end of the global value chain. In the composition of China’s exports, industrial
manufactured goods accounted for about 90%. But all factors considered, this world
factory was more like a world “processing plant” or “processing workshop.”
Despite the factor of low labor costs, China’s manufacturing industry had only a 5%
share of the global manufacturing market. It had low capacity in technological
accumulation and innovation, little brand-added value of industrial products, lim-
ited expertise in modern enterprise management, and severe shortage of high-end
human resources. All of these were the prices that the export-oriented economic
growth model had to bear and pay. In international trade, on the one hand, Chinese
enterprises were faced with barriers created by international trade protectionism. On
the other hand, some Chinese companies had to seize the world market by resorting
to the means of pricing, i.e., price cut, dumping, etc.
On all accounts, however, the strategic change of China’s economic growth
model indeed produced very prominent macroeconomic effects. According to the
National Bureau of Statistics, in the third stage of the reform, China’s strategic
change in the economic structure achieved remarkable growth in a very short period
of time. The per capita GDP increased from less than 1000 US dollars in 2001 to
1700 US dollars in 2005. The per capita disposable income of urban residents
reached 10,493 yuan in 2005, up by 58.3% from the year of 2000 in
inﬂation-corrected terms, the average annual growth rate being 9.6%. The per capita
disposable income of rural residents reached 3255 yuan, up by 29.2% from the year
of 2000 in inﬂation-corrected terms, the average annual growth rate being 5.3%.
2See Gao (2009, 2008, 2009, pp. 1–15).

The poverty-stricken population in rural areas also decreased by nearly 10 million
in less than 5 years.
While China’s GDP and per capita GDP kept growing at high speed in the third
stage of reform, the power also changed its rent-seeking model due to the increasing
force of capitalization in China’s economic structure, thus forming new prominent
contradictions between economic beneﬁts and social justice in wealth distribution.
Firstly, the regional gap in the distribution pattern gradually widened. At the
beginning of reform, the interprovincial Gini coefﬁcient of per capita GDP had once
declined rapidly. However, after 1990, this Gini coefﬁcient began to rise again,
reaching 0.35 in 2003,3 which was the same level with before the reform. Secondly,
the income disparity between rich and poor further aggravated. The Gini coefﬁcient
before the reform and opening up was 0.16, but reached 0.46 in 2002, overtaking
the internationally recognized warning level of 0.4.4 Moreover, as a result of the
enlarging divide between rich and poor, social stratiﬁcation tended to become ﬁxed
and unchangeable, rather clear boundaries began to appear between the social
classes, social mobility was reduced, and a social class reproduction mechanism
was formed.5 In addition, the phenomenon of rent-seeking aggravated and became
increasingly widespread. Such a rent-seeking mechanism, which some scholars
called the “new dual-track system,” converted enormous amounts of rent values
between
the

price
system
of
goods
and
services
and
the
not-yet-marketized price system of land, labor, capital and other elements, between
the state-owned enterprises’ monopolistic pricing and anarchic transfer.6
In addition, the full development of the market was not paralleled by the cor-
responding development of social security and protection. Although the develop-
ment of the market economy rationalized the allocation of capital and assets, the
“counter movement of social protection,”7 in Polanyi’s words, failed to materialize,
resulting in serious threats to the stability and security of the whole society. In the
early years of the 21st century, China’s social security system remained backward
and had a small coverage. The situation was aggravated by the all-round marke-
tization reform in various important ﬁelds related to the people’s livelihood in the
late 1990s. In addition, large numbers of potential safety hazards existed in
industrial production; mine accidents, for example, frequently occurred. In the
manufacturing industry, the energy consumption was too high, and the environ-
mental costs were too big. The supervision over commodity quality was not
enough; food safety accidents were still common after repeated prohibitions. All
these phenomena indicated the deepening of various social contradictions in this
period.

6.1.2
The Labor-Capital Relations and Various Aspects
of Social Contradictions
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the contradictions of labor-capital relations
were found in various aspects. Firstly, the state-owned enterprise reform promoted
the all-round marketization of labor relations. On the one hand, with state-owned
enterprises transformed toward the modern enterprise system, the all-staff labor
contract system was adopted in labor employment. On the other hand, due to the
incomplete social security system, large numbers of workers were laid off or
repositioned, their rights and life did not have proper protection and arrangement;
the phenomenon of “discontinuation of social insurance” became very serious.8
Secondly, various forms of non-state-owned economy have become an important
force in boosting China’s economic development, and have become the main
provider of employment.9 The recruitment and employment of non-public enter-
prises largely depended on the complex labor market. However, that labor market
was very incomplete and immature in terms of its component elements, industrial
norms, laws and regulations, social maintenance and many other aspects, and
consequently the labor relations could not be effectively adjusted. More impor-
tantly, as the main body of rural labor force movement, the broad masses of migrant
workers did not enjoy the protection of the urban social security system or the labor
management system due to urban-rural disparities and the restrictions of the
household registration system, which was more likely to caused labor-capital
contradictions that were difﬁcult to resolve. The above mentioned social equity
issues and social security issues were tightly interwoven and constituted prominent
contradictions in social governance.
Large amounts of labor-capital contradictions existed due to problems left over
from history by the restructuring of state-owned enterprises. Many also existed in
the non-public sector of the economy. Many of these contradictions intensiﬁed and
became labor disputes because there were no sufﬁcient and effective mechanisms
for people to express concerns related to their interests and for mediating social
tensions. According to the data from a sample survey carried out by the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) in 1997, from 1993 to 1997, an average of
8In 2002, the reemployment rate of laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises was 26%. The
main channels for reemployment of laid-off workers were concentrated in the ﬁeld of informal
employment. According to a sample survey by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security in 66
cities in 2002, of the laid-off workers who re-entered employment, 85.4% were engaged in
temporary work, only 9.4% became regular workers. See Guo (2004).
9According to the above statistics, by the end of 2002, excluding the state-owned and collective
sectors, investment by various non-public sectors of the economy accounted for 43.5% of the total
investment in the whole society; exports by the non-public sectors accounted for 62.3% of the
total. From the perspective of total employment, at the end of 2002 the total number of employed
persons in the urban areas was 247.8 million, of which 71.63 million were employed by
state-owned danwei, accounting for less than 30% of the total, while various non-state-owned
danwei employed more than 70% of the total.
6.1

1.902 million labor disputes took place in China each year, and the total number of
workers participating in collective labor disputes reached 1.268 million.10 After
2000, with the completion of enterprise restructuring in all of China, the number of
labor dispute cases continued to rise; the number of petition cases increased dra-
matically, and many areas saw collective acts of violence. According to statistics, in
1995 the National Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission received a total of 33,000
cases of labor disputes. In 2003, the total number of labor dispute cases for the ﬁrst
time exceeded 200,000, reaching 226,000, an increase of 22.8% over 2002. This
was the highest growth rate since 1999. The number of workers involved in the
cases increased by 31.7% over 2002, also the highest rate since 1999.11
However, because it took too long and cost too much to resolve the disputes
through legal means, still a large number of workers chose to resolve labor disputes
through petition letters and other normal or abnormal methods. Therefore, the real
number of labor dispute cases should far surpass the numbers mentioned above,
which were cases to be resolved through legal means. As to the petition cases,
according to the statistics of the State Bureau for Letters and Calls, the total number
of petition cases increased sharply in 2003, among which those triggered by labor
disputes were the biggest category.
Abundant records show that the migrant workers in many regions were given
extremely harsh treatment in concrete labor processes, ranging from the recruitment
conditions to the working conditions, from wage distribution to labor safety.
Because the majority of labor-intensive private enterprises, small and medium-sized
individual proprietorship enterprises and joint ventures adopted the piece-rate wage
system, the decisions on labor intensity and wage standards did not have strict
criteria or a supervision mechanism, and were made almost exclusively by the
business owners. As a result, many companies turned into “sweatshops,” where
workers worked more than 12 h a day, at extremely high labor intensity. Holding
down the wages of workers became the enterprise owners’ main method for
reducing production costs. According to a survey in The Movement of Labor Force
in China’s Cities written by Wang Fenyu and others, in the city of Wuxi, workers in
1/4 of the collective enterprises and 1/3 of the private enterprises worked more than
55 h per week. In the city of Zhuhai, half of the workers in private enterprises and
foreign-funded enterprises worked more than 55 h per week, 2/3 of the workers
worked more than 45 h per week.12
In addition to the above, skimping on the workers’ wages and wage arrears
became widespread practices in the enterprises. According to a survey of 66 cities
by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security at the end of 2002, 7.7% of the private
enterprises made wage payment in arrears, their average amount of arrears being
1608 yuan; 3.0% of the foreign-funded enterprises and joint ventures made wage

payment in arrears, their average amount of arrears being 2087 yuan.13 According
to a survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2004, solving the
problem of wage arrears was still the most urgent demand of migrant workers
working in the cities. Of the 4473 migrant workers surveyed, 10% reported having
suffered from wage arrears for various reasons during the previous year. On
average, wage payment was delayed for seven months, the average amount being
1754 yuan.14
Another noteworthy problem was that in some eastern coastal areas, although the
levels of economic development and capital accumulation had been greatly
improved over the past decade, the workers’ income level did not improve, but on
the contrary deteriorated. The most typical of such situations could be found in
Shenzhen. When Shenzhen SEZ was ﬁrst established, the monthly wage of migrant
workers ranged from 200 to 300 yuan. In the early 1990s the monthly wage ranged
from 800 to 1000 yuan. However, in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the 21st century, millions
of migrant workers in Shenzhen only earned an average monthly wage of less than
600 yuan.15 This situation led to a paradox. In China, where labor surplus was
prevalent in general, serious shortage of labor was reported in many areas, and
became a main bottleneck of economic development.
Because the production of large numbers of enterprises in the primitive accu-
mulation stage had the characteristics of high resource consumption and low level
of technology, in many private and foreign-funded enterprises, the workers’
working environment was extremely poor. They often undertook their work in
severely polluted environment. Very few of them had the protection of complete
safety and health care measures, resulting in frequent work accidents. A survey
conducted by Sichuan Province shows that 62.2% of the migrant workers did not
have labor protection supplies; 57.75% had not received training in safe production;
9.3% had experienced one work accident; 4.23% had experienced two work acci-
dents.16 Many enterprise owners refused to pay social insurance premiums for the
migrant workers, refused to pay or paid insufﬁcient medical expenses for treating
work injuries, refused to give compensations for work injuries according to relevant
laws and regulations, refused to implement the regulations concerning the protec-
tion of female workers. In some individual cases, the business owners or managers
even made serious violations on the workers’ rights of the person. They carried out
“closed-off management” which restricted the workers’ freedom of person; their
insulting behaviors toward the migrant workers, such as body search, beating,
scolding and corporal punishment, were common happenings; they savagely
imposed on the workers forced labor and violent management. According to Pan
Yi’s research, many workers contracted serious psychological diseases due to
13Guo (2004).

excessively high labor intensity.17 Ren Yan and others’ research shows that the
“dormitory labor regime” enhanced the effective control of workers, and that the
enterprises’ exploitation of the migrant workers in both production space and living
space became an important feature of China’s labor-intensive enterprises.18
From the perspective of economic development, with the advancement of eco-
nomic globalization, the enterprises based on export-oriented economy continu-
ously faced the pressure of increasingly ﬁerce competition. Being the world factory,
China’s economy largely depended on the manufacturing industry, which was
characterized by ﬁerce competition in the international market; under this back-
ground, the Chinese enterprises had only meager proﬁt margins; their average proﬁt
rate generally remained at a stable level, without much space for rapid increase. The
management reforms within the enterprises were basically completed, and the
marginal beneﬁts of management gains gradually declined. In the international
market, the speed of product innovations and model changes accelerated; however,
due to the gradual shrinkage of investment space, investment surplus appeared.
More importantly, because the government administrative costs were too high, the
tax rates were always maintained at a high level; the shortage of cheap labor also
further pushed up labor costs. Under the impact of all these factors, China’s
export-oriented economy was already having a hard time even before the global
ﬁnancial crisis in 2008.
6.2
Manifestations of the Contradictions
in Labor Relations
As a result of the tax-sharing system reform in the mid-1990s, the local govern-
ments became proﬁt-seekers, who were no longer interested in setting up enter-
prises, and began to adopt new forms of rent-seeking such as dominating the real
estate business through land requisitions, ﬁnancing and other means. The local
governments then expanded the size of their administrative bureaucracy, which
rapidly increased administrative costs, and to a certain extent increased the tax
burden on the enterprises. In contrast, with the implementation of enterprise
restructuring and the gradual clariﬁcation of property rights relations, enterprises at
all levels gradually straightened out their ownership structure. With clearly deﬁned
ownership relations, the deﬁnition of management rights based on ownership rights
also became clear. After these two types of relations were clariﬁed, the modern
enterprise system based on corporate governance structure could be established.
The structures and boundaries within the enterprises also became distinct and clear
cut. The enterprises could ﬁnally cast off constraints, act freely, steadfastly adhere
to the principles of efﬁciency coming ﬁrst and proﬁt coming ﬁrst, and strive hard to

carry through the ideals of rationality and bureaucracy in achieving proﬁt goals by
maximizing production scales and minimizing labor costs in disregard of whatever
social costs. In the process of marketization, the priority of capital was the primary
principle for the survival and development of the enterprise, and the enterprise
should no longer be impeded by the various obligations that complex ownership
relations determined, which was the case for the township enterprises in the past.
6.2.1
The Low-End Effects of International Division
of Labor
The establishment of the modern enterprise system liberated the enterprises from
the
fetters
of
complicated
ownership
relations,
changing
them
into
real
proﬁt-making organizations. In terms of the organization and the operating structure
of the enterprise itself, the clariﬁcation of its ownership relations and management
relations helped them to strictly follow the principles of the market in capital
operation and cost control. However, from the perspective of the entire economic
system in which the enterprise was embedded, the enterprise had always been just
one link in the overall economic chain. In the era of the planned economy, the
enterprises were attached to a huge state administrative system, while in the era of
market economy, the enterprises are attached to a trans-regional, cross-industrial,
and even international system of capital and market. Therefore, in terms of the
capital operation, production control and human resource management within
the enterprise, the enterprise is an independent business entity; but in terms of the
overall market and governance system, the enterprise is a dependent entity. The two
features are both opposite and complementary to each other.
Since the beginning of the 21st century, with the all-round integration of China’s
economy and the international market, the business operations of Chinese enter-
prises were gradually incorporated into the international market chain. The
boundaries of the enterprise in the sense of governance were also pushed beyond
national borders. Since the 1990s, in the layout of the international manufacturing
industry, many export-oriented Chinese enterprises, as well as a large number of
joint ventures and joint-stock enterprises, adopted the business form of the
“putting-out system” or “make to order” (MTO), and engaged in business activities
on the international market as the terminal sector of the global production system.
In fact, the business form of “make to order” was closely related to the conditions of
latecomer industrial development. When China ﬁrst jointed the WTO, it lagged
behind the developed countries in various aspects of business operation, including
management, technology, brand marketing, etc. However, in the business form of
“make to order,” the product design had already been completed, and the pro-
duction standards had already been set. Because the sales volume was usually rather
small, most customers ordered OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) produc-
tion and had rigid requirements on delivery time. Many small and medium-sized
6.2
Manifestations of the Contradictions in Labor Relations
159

enterprises had great ﬂexibility to cater to such demands; after receiving an order,
they could easily make arrangements for raw materials, production and shipments.
Nevertheless, an important reason for the adoption of “make to order” and OEM
production was cheap labor.
An important condition for China to become the “world factory” was the con-
tinuous supply of rural surplus labor. Since the 1990s, with the deepening of
market-oriented reforms, the momentum of system innovation within the rural areas
weakened, and the peasants’ income from agriculture kept declining. In addition,
the local governments bought and sold the peasants’ land through using both the
non-market means of land requisition and the market means of selling, which was
called the “price scissors of land.” In the process of rapid urbanization, the local
governments, the enterprises, even the urban residents who purchased real estate, all
participated in sharing the commercial value of land through this system of “price
scissors of land.” Only the peasants were the biggest victims. In this period, the
main driving force behind the change in the pattern of urban-rural relations came
from the large-scale and cross-regional movement of the rural labor force. The
outﬂow of large numbers of young and middle-aged adults led to the desolation of
the rural economy and rural social life, which in turn continued to promote the
outﬂow of labor force, thus providing inexhaustible supplies of manpower for the
vast number of enterprises.19
As mentioned above, the re-establishment and adjustment of ownership relations
in the process of property rights reform played a key role in stimulating the pro-
ductivity of the enterprises. The enterprise gradually became an independent
business entity, no longer subject to the restrictions of other dimensions of own-
ership relations (such as public ownership and common ownership). In this sense,
the primary means for achieving maximum efﬁciency was cost control. It is pre-
cisely because the “impurities” in ownership relations were removed in the sense of
private ownership that the enterprises could save labor costs to the utmost extent.
And only those workers who were surplus labor from poverty-stricken rural areas,
who did not have any community-based protections, could become the mainstream
labor force in the labor market, and achieve their own employment status through
the contract system. In the mean time, because the proﬁt margins of large numbers
of OEM enterprises were heavily squeezed by the international market, they could
only make proﬁts by lowering labor costs and shifting the burdens from ﬂuctuations
in the international market and administrative charges onto the workers.
Some scholars use the word “sweatshop” to refer to model of employment
production represented by OEM (original equipment manufacturer) production. In
this early American factory model, the use of hired labor was combined with
piece-rate wages and high-speed assembly line work, pushing up labor intensity,
and keeping the wage standards as low as possible. The employees’ labor contracts
19At present, 57.6% of the workers in China’s secondary industry are migrant workers; 52% of the
workers in the tertiary industry nationwide are migrant workers; 90% of the workers in urban
construction, environmental sanitation, housekeeping and catering service are migrant workers.

practically performed no functions. There was no possibility for any collective
gaming behavior. In the “sweatshops,” a management model similar to Taylor’s
management system was adopted, implementing strict labor segmentation and labor
control; the entire factory had no entertainment facilities, no corporate culture; the
employers rarely bought “wu xian yi jin” (ﬁve social insurances and one housing
fund) or “san xian yi jin” (three social insurances and one housing fund) for the
employees, or provided other kinds of social welfare that the citizens of the country
were entitled to. In fact, the factory governance system, as Burawoy said, is
endowed with the meaning of “politics of production.”20 This brutal kind of pro-
duction governance has gone far beyond the production space of the assembly lines
on which previous theories had focused, and has extended to the employees’ daily
life. For example, some scholars put forward the concept of “dormitory labor
regime,” which refers to the employment situation where the factory assumes
responsibility for the daily reproduction of labor force through providing the
migrant workers with separate living quarters near the production space. Here, the
production space and space for labor force reproduction are integrated into one.
The workers and the factories are tightly glued together. Capital has expanded its
productive repression of labor to include the full-scale monitoring of the employees,
which coincides perfectly with Foucault’s Panopticism.21 At the same time, many
companies also try to implement a monitoring system of thorough severance in the
management of the employees’ life, cutting off all social relations of the migrant
workers, ranging from kinship relations, blood relations, to geographical relations
and so on, and turn them into a single atomic form.
Some empirical studies have shown that the above-mentioned labor system is a
systematic product of transnational labor processes. It reintegrates the logic of
capital operation and the logic of state operation in a particular concrete production
space at the micro level. The economic logic of capital is to obtain maximum
surplus value through controlling the production process of labor force, that is, to
solve the double indeterminacy between labor force and labor in the shortest
possible time and conduct rapid accumulation of capital around the world. On the
other hand, the political logic of the state is to realize objectives of industrialization
and urbanization through effective control of the movement of workers, without
having to assume responsibility for labor force reproduction.22 The labor system
and the household registration system work together to form a special kind of labor
relations, in which the workers’ life falls under the all-round control of capital.
In this respect, an extreme case was the Foxconn suicides, that is, a number of
Foxconn workers successively jumped to their death from buildings. “The General
Report on the Joint Investigation of Foxconn Suicides by Universities from
Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan” pointed out, in this enormous “world factory,”
150 million rural migrant workers worked in cities far from their homes, “such a

phenomenon of serial suicides was not a fortuitous, isolated event, but a sign and a
warning.” “Foxconn, a contract manufacturing empire which hires 800,000
employees, and manufactures equipment for almost all leading brands of electronic
products in the world, is actually quite mysterious, forbidden, surrounded by high
walls. People do not know whether measures like pay raise, psychological coun-
seling, and help hotlines have solved the Foxconn workers’ problems, neither do
they know whether Foxconn is really a law-abiding ‘model enterprise’ with a good
sense of social responsibility as it has claimed, nor how much blood and sweat was
shed by generations of workers behind the halo of this empire.”23 In this indifferent
production system, “whether dead or alive, the Foxconn workers all struggled or are
still struggling in hardship. The workers who committed suicide by jumping off
buildings chose to use their ﬂesh, blood and life to accuse; and the living still
quietly endure the double sufferings of physical and spiritual torment, and even
wander on the edge of spiritual death. They do not know whether to compromise is
the only choice in this tyrannical management system, nor do they know where
their future lies.”24 This autocratic form of factory regime reveals that whether it is
the “politics of production” or the “politics of life,” whether it is “dormitory labor
regime” or “community regime,” they have all become anti-governance systems of
all-round social exclusion. All of them are prone to cause the extreme behaviors of
workers, whether these behaviors are self-destructive or rebellious.25
In short, in the process of China’s economic integration with the global system,
due to the low-end effects of international division of labor and the segmenting
effects of the social structure, the economic development under the “make to order”
system or contract manufacturing system only emphasized the process of capital
input, while the construction of labor management system and social security
system seriously lagged behind, which resulted in labor segmentation and labor
control, and gave rise to extremely harmful social contradictions and social prob-
lems. The root of this problem lies in the enterprise restructuring of the 1990s,
during which China quickly sorted out the enterprises’ ownership relations, but
failed to form a sound social protection mechanism with its social development. As
a result, in the governance of extreme capitalization, as the early Western factory
regimes had experienced, all social relations of the workers were forcefully severed
and abolished; the workers were atomized by the factory governance system, and
found themselves at the mercy of capital power. Vast numbers of migrant workers
were thrown into an abandoned state of existence by this form of bare labor; they
were victims of deprivation by capital coercion and institutional marginalization.

6.2.2
Problems Left Over from History by Enterprise
Restructuring
The deepening of state-owned enterprise reform will lead to all-round marketization
of China’s labor relations. On the one hand, when the state-owned enterprises
carried out transformation toward the modern enterprise system, they certainly
would implement the all-staff labor contract system in labor employment, and
gradually integrate with the external labor market, which led to the laying off of
large numbers of workers. On the other hand, because the problems of the
state-owned enterprises’ fuzzy ownership and the absence of distinct owners were
not fundamentally resolved, the state-owned enterprises were unable to establish
real market-oriented labor relations. Because of this and the lack of a complete
social security system, large numbers of laid-off workers and repositioned workers
failed to get proper protection and arrangements for their rights and life.
Starting from the 1990s, state-owned enterprise restructuring was vigorously
carried out in China. The restructuring of state-owned enterprises could be divided
into two parts: the adjustment of the economic layout of the state-owned sector and
the property rights reform of the state-owned enterprises. Both are based on the
precondition of market-oriented employment of state-owned enterprises. On the one
hand, in the process of adjusting the state-owned economy, a large number of
enterprises without market competitiveness changed the line of production or went
bankrupt, causing tens of millions of workers to become unemployed or
semi-unemployed for a long period. Suddenly their identity changed from the
owner of the enterprise to unemployed personnel who were “abandoned” by the
society. They not only lost a lifetime’s guarantee in material life, but also experi-
enced tremendous changes in spiritual life. On the other hand, due to the changes
caused by the property rights reform of state-owned enterprises, the laid-off workers
had to face brutal competition in the labor market under the condition of huge
overall labor surplus. This situation demanded the laid-off workers to achieve
signiﬁcant changes in objective ability and subjective awareness in a short time.
The laid-off workers encountered great changes in their life situation and suf-
fered from huge psychological imbalance. More importantly, the whole set of
protection and security originally provided by the state-owned enterprises, covering
birth, death, illness and old age, suddenly disintegrated, pushing the vast number of
laid-off workers instantly into a volatile market. Both the enterprises and the
workers were faced with risks in the capital market and the labor market. For these
reasons, the laid-off workers found themselves being at their wits’ end, and stuck in
a state of utter confusion. The original state system which could have been their
ultimate refuge suddenly withdrew, leaving the laid-off workers in a helpless sit-
uation.26 The overall situation of the recent years shows that the pressure of
26Li et al. (2006).
6.2

163

reemploying laid-off workers is still very high; their income is still very low and
extremely unstable; a considerable part of them are living below the poverty line.
Although the status change of the workers in state-owned enterprises is a
potential prerequisite for the formation of new labor-capital relations from the
perspective of the workers themselves, the transfer of state-owned assets and the
distribution of wealth in the process of restructuring have in fact become a more
important factor in shaping such labor-capital relations. These issues are directly
related to the question of social justice in resettling the laid-off workers. They also
have direct impact on the workers’ basic pattern of awareness about the
labor-capital relations to be formed in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to make
economic compensations for the workers in state-owned enterprise restructuring
because the workers are the direct bearer of the social and economic costs of the
economic layout adjustment and enterprise property rights reform. They are the key
factor in maintaining social stability and economic development. However, most
paradoxically, all the enterprises that had been involved in the adjustment of
state-owned economy and the property rights reform were also enterprises that had
business difﬁculties or were even insolvent enterprises. Large numbers of laid-off
workers from these enterprises could not get the minimum wage for a long time, nor
did they receive any economic compensations. In concrete social operation, many
laid-off workers’ social insurance was discontinued, although some of them
received subsistence allowances from the state.
In addition, in the process of state-owned enterprise property rights reform, there
existed a lot of power-for-money deals in wide-spread corruption. State-owned
assets were rapidly converted into private wealth through a variety of illegal means,
while the broad masses of workers who had made great contributions for creating
and accumulating these assets came away empty-handed. Such serious polarization
between the rich and the poor greatly damaged the social mechanisms of equality
and trust, increased people’s sense of relative deprivation and sense of status dis-
parity, resulting in a lack of value in the whole society. As a result, no clear and
sufﬁcient value support can be found in the overall social environment for
labor-capital relations.27
In the process of state-owned enterprise restructuring, another phenomenon also
contributed to the deterioration of labor-capital relations, that is, the series of
institutions and measures originally established by the state-owned enterprises for
the workers’ democratic participation, including the Workers’ Congress, were
mostly abandoned and lost their functions, making it difﬁcult for the broad masses
of workers to legally express their own interests and opinions through institution-
alized channels. When such social discontentment accumulated to a certain degree,
large numbers of collective protests and other collective actions would break out, or
the workers would shift all the pressures of social instability directly onto the
government through writing petition letters, making petition visits, and so on.

6.2.3
Institutional Deviation in Labor Governance
Since the beginning of the 21st century, China’s active participation in the global
market indeed gave vitality to its economic development. However, the effects of
economic globalization were not limited to the economic ﬁeld, to a great extent it
resulted in the international market’s reverse regulation of China’s economic
activities. While Chinese products entered the international market, all most all
aspects China’s economic life had to be geared to the international standards,
including the market’s legal environment, the way the government was involved in
the market, the enterprises’ technical, quality and management standards, the
enterprises’ social responsibilities, etc. Such inﬂuences from the international
market further enhanced the ideology of technicalization, standardization and
rationalization in the government and enterprises. Around the year of 2001, the
Chinese government and legislature substantially revised more than 2000 pieces of
laws, administrative regulations and departmental regulations, including the
Foreign Investment Law and the Foreign Trade Law, as well as more than 190,000
local laws and regulations.
Although relevant state departments made adjustments in the governance system
according to the demands of the global economy, the adjustment of labor gover-
nance system relatively lagged behind. Moreover, while drafting and promulgating
relevant laws and regulations, people did not fully consider the question of
embeddedness in regime governance. In fact, in the 1990s, the general discourse of
reform was basically formulated around the concept of marketization; the discourse
of capital such as property rights reform and enterprise restructuring had far greater
inﬂuence than the discourse of labor protection and social security. Especially in the
domain of public social services, comprehensive market-oriented reforms were
carried out one after another in the ﬁelds of social security and social welfare that
were related to the national economy and the people’s livelihood in the traditional
planned economy. Housing, health care, social insurance, education, etc., were all
put on the agenda of the all-round marketization reform. In this sense, the broad
masses of workers basically lost all features of rights in terms of ownership rela-
tions; they also found themselves at the bottom of the entire production and
management chain in terms of management relations. In the mean time they were
prone to become socially neglected groups in the sense of governance. The contract
employment system widely adopted in the whole society mostly embodied the
meaning of hired labor in the discourse of capital, and still lacked effective social
protection in the sense of governance. Under this circumstance, even if some
policies, laws and regulations were put forward to promote labor protection, they
were still prone to deviate from the original intention in the context of all-round
marketization.
In January 2008, the ofﬁcial promulgation of the Labor Contract Law showed
that the central government took the aggravation of labor conﬂicts in the new
situation very seriously, and demonstrated its determination in mediating the
labor-capital relations through legal and administrative means. The Labor Contract

Law aimed to strengthen the protection of workers; in particular, it has stipulations
about the establishment, fulﬁllment, alteration, rescission and termination of labor
contracts. In the “Special Provisions” of the law, stipulations are also made con-
cerning collective contracts, labor dispatching, part-time employment and speciﬁc
responsibilities in the implementation of the law.28 The practical implementation of
the Labor Contract Law has indeed achieved fruitful results. The signing rate of
labor contracts has increased signiﬁcantly. The tendency of signing short-term labor
contracts has changed, with the average term of new labor contracts signiﬁcantly
prolonged. The quality of the labor contracts has also improved. The contract terms
are more complete; the provisions on the rights and obligations of both parties are
clearer; and timely supplements can be made to the contracts to adapt to the need of
new situations. The coverage of social insurance has expanded, while the revenue
of the social insurance fund has also increased.29 The rights and interests of the
migrant workers have been better protected, and the workers’ awareness of rights
protection has been strengthened. The enterprises have enhanced their human
resource management, and further normalized the employment order. Many
enterprises sent personnel to participate in trainings on the Labor Contract Law, so
that they could gradually understand and adapt to its requirements, revise and
improve relevant internal rules and regulations, sign make-up labor contracts,
28As special attention was given to the probation period which was often exploited as a loophole in
the labor employment system, The Labor Contract Law strengthened the protection of workers in
the probation period. For workers who are to serve a term of labor contract longer than three
months but less than one year, the probation period shall not exceed one month; for workers who
are to serve more than one year but less than three years, the probation period shall not exceed two
months; for workers who are to serve a term longer than three years, whether the term is ﬁxed or
not, the probation period shall not exceed six months. If the labor contract has speciﬁed no ﬁxed
term other than completion of a job, or if the term of the labor contract is less than three months,
the contract shall not stipulate a probation period. The same employer and the same worker can
only arrange one probation period. The Labor Contract Law also set limits on the minimum wage
of the probation period. The wages of the workers in the probation period shall not be less than the
lowest wage of the same work position in the employer danwei, nor less than 80% of the wage
stipulated in the labor contract. It is also emphasized that the wage in the probation period shall not
be lower than the minimum wage of the local area of the employer danwei. The Labor Contract
Law also stipulates that the employer danwei cannot ﬁre a worker in probation period at will.
During the probation period, the employer danwei shall not terminate the labor contract except that
the worker has the circumstances stipulated in Article 39, or in Item 1 and Item 2 of Article 40, of
this Law. If the employer danwei decides to terminate a labor contract during the probation period,
it should explain the reasons to the worker(s). See the full text of the Labor Contract Law of the
People’s Republic of China.
29As of September 2009, the number of people who have participated in the basic pension
insurance, basic health care insurance, unemployment insurance, work injury insurance and
maternity insurance stood respectively at 214.74, 273.99, 122.03, 134.59, and 87.97 million. The
numbers have increased over the previous year respectively by 13.37, 50.88, 5.58, 12.86, and
10.22 million. From January to September, the income of the ﬁve social insurance funds reached
947.1 billion yuan, an increase of 223.3 billion yuan, or 30.8%, over the same period of the
previous year. See the report about Liu Jichen, head of the Legal Affairs Department of ACFTU,

standardize the procedure of wage payment, pay social insurance according to the
law, and ensure the implementation of various provisions of the law.
However, in the concrete implementation of the Labor Contract Law, there were
also cases where the provisions were divorced from reality. A particular case was
that many enterprises, including multinational corporations and state-owned
enterprises, took advantage of some ambiguous stipulations, and used the method
of labor service dispatching to infringe on the rights and interests of workers. For
example, in some industries that required comparatively high professional skills,
large numbers of “dispatch workers” were used. The four state-owned commercial
banks, China Post, the railway branch bureaus of the former Ministry of Railways
all had a large number of “dispatch workers.”30 According to the Labor Contract
Law, labor dispatching should generally be used for temporary, auxiliary, or sub-
stitutable work positions. But game-play in the process of legislation led to the
ambiguity of this provision. The original draft stipulated that labor dispatching
should not be used for work posts that last for more than one year. But this clause
was removed when the draft law was voted on. The Enforcement Regulations of the
Labor Contract Law (Draft) promulgated on September 18, 2008 also had a clause
stipulating that labor dispatching should not be used for work posts of longer than
six months, but eventually that clause was also deleted.
Because the Labor Contract Law only made very sketchy description about the
scope of application of labor dispatching, i.e., “substitutable, temporary and aux-
iliary,” instead of enumerating speciﬁc industries, types of work and professions as
the laws of developed countries did, a phenomenon of “reverse dispatching” took
place. Before the enforcement of the Labor Contract Law, many enterprises hur-
riedly terminated the contracts of veteran workers who had served them for many
years, and found a dispatch company to manage these kicked-out workers; they
then had the dispatch company to dispatch these workers back, so that they could
save labor costs. To take advantage of this loophole in the law, a large number of
“labor dispatch companies” were set up in various industries and various regions in
recent years. In order to evade the provision in the Labor Contract Law on making
compensations for terminating and rescinding labor contracts, the dispatch com-
pany often colluded with the enterprises that used dispatched labor. That is, after the
work was ﬁnished, the workers were kicked back to the dispatch company, which,
instead of making compensations, could just dispatch the workers to other
enterprises.31
30Interestingly, a group of university students carried out a survey of Coca-Cola China through
ﬁrsthand experience of working part-time in the company, and published a report of the title
“Coca-Cola Investigation Report.” According to this report, a large number of dispatched workers
and other types of informal workers work in the system of Coca-Cola China. These workers do the
most dangerous, the harshest, and the most tiring work, they have the longest working hours, but
are paid the lowest wages, which often come in arrears or in reduced sums. See College Student
Observers’ Group on Coca-Cola (2008).
31According to rough estimates, there are more than a thousand labor dispatch companies just in
Beijing. Under the current system, the labor dispatch workers are most likely to encounter the

In the mean time, a phenomenon of “false dispatch” hidden in the process of
“reverse dispatch” has inﬂicted greater damage upon the workers. In this phe-
nomenon, the labor dispatch company took advantage of the “triangular relation-
ship” between the three parties, i.e., the dispatch company, the actual employer and
the workers, coerced the workers into signing a contract with another labor dispatch
company which had no clear work relationship with them and thus had no legal
liability. This type of “reverse dispatch” was in fact a kind of employer “coercion,”
under which the workers were threatened with dismissal if they did not comply. As
a result, the stable labor relations between the two parties were destroyed. In
general, the second labor dispatch company was usually a small company, even a
“briefcase company.” In the event of work injury, wage disputes, it was extremely
difﬁcult for the workers to obtain legal compensations because they had lost the
basic legal rights of recourse. “False dispatch” also resulted in the shortening of the
workers’ length of service in the ofﬁcial records, causing further damage to the
legitimate rights and interests of the workers. Especially from 2008 onwards, due to
the impact of the international ﬁnancial crisis, domestic enterprises faced increasing
difﬁculties, the phenomenon of wage arrears became more widespread. The
enterprises found it more difﬁcult to pay the workers’ social insurance premiums in
full. Therefore, the enterprises in many places adopted this form of labor dispatch to
avoid legal responsibilities. In some places there were even business owners who
escaped and hid themselves after failing to pay the workers’ wages. These factors
led to a signiﬁcant increase in the number of labor dispute cases.
It can be said that the further improvement of technocratic governance and the
legal system still failed to fully achieve the rule of law in labor-capital relations in
terms of law-making and law enforcement. On the one hand, power and capital
once again became concentrated through clever ways. On the other hand, new
forms of deprivation such as labor dispatching appeared in the society. In this sense,
the governance system needs to conduct overall governance planning to further
adjust and regulate the labor relations. It should implement all-round social man-
agement, mobilize various social resources, and carry out labor protection.
following types of inequality. Firstly, they are likely to receive unequal treatment in comparison
with the regular workers of the employer danwei. The treatment here mainly refers to non-statutory
treatment, such as year-end bonus, work clothes, etc. This is followed by the problems of insurance
and work injury, in particular the rescission of labor contracts. According to the Labor Contract
Law, if the enterprise take the initiative in terminating labor relations with an employee, it should
give the employee a sum of economic compensation. However, because only work relations, not
labor relations, exist between the employer and the dispatch worker, the legal responsibilities are
evaded.

6.3
The Public Governance of Labor Relations
In order to fundamentally solve the various social contradictions in the
above-mentioned social and economic ﬁelds, since 2003, the central government
has gradually formed a “scientiﬁc outlook of development,” a set of basic ideas for
state governance. That is, the government behaviors in the nature of business
operations should be thoroughly discontinued and replaced by a governance system
based on public services; the core issues of administrative construction and
supervision should include rule of law, establishment of norms, technicalization and
standardization. The transition from business operation to governance not only
reﬂected the basic idea of undertaking social constructions according to the logic of
“administrative absorption of politics” in this stage, but also changed the structure
of the administrative system, the pattern of government behaviors and the gov-
ernment’s intrinsic relationships with various social and economic ﬁelds.
6.3.1
Technocratic Governance and Social Responsibility
As we all know, in the hierarchical administrative system of the Chinese govern-
ment, the target responsibility system has been implemented from the beginning,
where governments of a higher level issue targets, assign tasks, and give quanti-
tative assessments to lower-level governments. Although at different stages, in
different conditions, the lower-level governments had varying amounts of bar-
gaining space over the formulation of speciﬁc targets, on the whole this target
responsibility system is similar to what some scholars call a “pressure system.”32
Because China’s political system has not undergone an all-round reform like the
marketization reform of the economic system, there have always existed features of
“pressure” in the administrative system. Moreover, after the tax-sharing system
reform, this system enhanced centralization, and tightly combined technocratic
governance with target management. In this situation, the transfer of pressure
between higher and lower levels of government is embodied in “ze ren zhuang”
(formal guarantee to meet a certain goal). That is, a higher level government gives
speciﬁc quantitative goals and targets to each of its subordinate departments and
agencies, instructs them to complete the tasks within the speciﬁed time, and gives
them administrative promotion or administrative penalty according to the results of
task performance. In addition, in the organizational practice, a system of “term of
ofﬁce” is adopted for the promotion and assignment of administrative ofﬁcials. As a
result, in the administrative terms of many local ofﬁcials or functional departments,
they generally set targets and work quotas that are higher than those issued by the
higher-level government. That is, in the assessment based on quantitative targets,
those who want to win the ﬁerce performance competition, must outstrip all others
32See Rong et al. (1998).
6.3
The Public Governance of Labor Relations
169

in ﬁxing, reaching and surpassing targets, so as to accumulate as much political
capital as possible during the current term to get promotion for the next term of
ofﬁce.33
Under this condition, the administrative reform triggered by new governance
ideas, further strengthened the tendencies of multiplicity and technicalization of
quantitative targets. Under the guidance of new governance ideas, the conversion of
administrative functions to public services changed the cadre assessment index
system of the past, which was based only on GDP. With the proposal of the
“scientiﬁc outlook of development” and “building a harmonious socialist society,”
many multi-dimensional and hard-to-measure governmental public service func-
tions were fully incorporated into the scope of target control, which was based on
quantitative management. For example, the “green targets” incorporated the targets
of cost control and social impact control concerning environmental pollution and
energy consumption into the assessment. The “public opinion targets” changed the
mechanism of the superior ofﬁcial’s one-sided decision on cadre promotion, and
incorporated public satisfaction appraisal into the assessment of cadre performance.
The “social stability targets” further strengthened the administrative accountability
system. Various factors affecting social stability, such as mass disturbance events
and major safety accidents, constitute a one-vote veto in the performance assess-
ment of ofﬁcials. It can be said that the quantitative assessment of multiple targets
not only expanded the horizontal scope of the administrative target responsibility
system, but also increased the vertical strength of the government’s overall gov-
ernance and control.
The technicalization of administrative governance is consistent with the state’s
efforts in constructing the enterprise assets management system and corporate
governance structure. Since 2001, both state-owned enterprises and private enter-
prises have engaged in the establishment of the modern enterprise system, that is, at
the enterprise level, they should further improve the company system and share-
holding system, and establish a complete modern property rights system. In terms
of the property rights system, the central government actively promoted the
shareholding system, the development of mixed ownership economy, the diversi-
ﬁcation of investment subjects, while keeping the important enterprises under state
control. By 2002, of the 4371 key enterprises in China, 76% had completed
enterprise restructuring. 3118 enterprises had established a clear enterprise investor
system on the basis of having general checkup on the ﬁxed assets and delineating
property rights. In 2003, the third Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central
Committee passed “The Resolution on Issues Regarding the Improvement of the
Socialist Market Economic System,” which emphasized again the following issues.
The state should vigorously develop a mixed ownership economy with the par-
ticipation of state capital, collective capital and non-state capital. The shareholding
system should be the major channel through which public ownership could be
realized. Property rights of various types should be protected in accordance with the
33Zhou (2008, pp. 89, 208–209).

law. The regulations on property rights transactions and the system of supervision
should be improved. Effective circulation of property rights should be encouraged.
Equal legal status and equal development rights should be ensured for the market
subjects. After the promulgation of this document, the property rights reform of
state-owned enterprises further deepened. The small and medium state-owned
enterprises began to reform in the direction of non-state-owned joint-stock system
or joint-stock cooperative system, and began to allow part of the managerial staff to
acquire or hold shares.
The new round of reform unfolded quickly. However, due to insufﬁcient
supervision, many enterprises incurred serious losses of state-owned assets.
Strangely enough, some enterprises even acted as both the seller and the buyer in
the same transaction.34 These phenomena had such a great impact that a tit-for-tat
debate was set off among the intelligentsia.35 Not until 2005 did the State-owned
Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC)
ﬁnally introduce the “ﬁve bans” on the acquisition of state-owned assets by man-
agerial staff, which guided the direction of state-owned enterprise property rights
reform.
In fact, because “ownership” is fundamental to the formation and distribution of
all the rights of the enterprise, property rights reform must involve various aspects
of the enterprise organization, including political, social and economic aspects. In
particular, the supervision of state-owned assets is a core issue related to the
enterprise’s business efﬁciency and distribution fairness. In 2003, the State-owned
Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) was established,
which was responsible for delimitation of property rights, registration of property
rights, supervision of assets evaluation, general checkup on the ﬁxed assets,
keeping statistics and so on in state-owned assets management. Especially in the
respect of property rights transactions, this agency enhanced the supervision of such
transactions, promoted the reasonable ﬂow of state-owned assets, and carried out
supervision and management of the actual performance of the enterprises in pre-
serving and increasing the value of state-owned assets through keeping statistics,

enhancement of supervision was emphasized in several aspects. Firstly, it stan-

35In 2004, Lang Xianping proposed that it was necessary to halt the property rights trading of
state-owned enterprises and to ban management buyout (MBO). A complete professional manager
system with incentive mechanisms and ﬁduciary responsibilities must be set up. [see Lang
Xianping’s (2004); also see Lang Xianping’s (2004)]. Soon after, a debate with the mainstream
economists ensued, focusing on the major issues of state-owned enterprise reform, such as
management buyout, the dilution and transfer of state-owned assets, employee stock ownership,
etc. (see The Economic Observer, September 11, 2004). Interestingly, most of the public opinions
in the discussion of property rights trading focused on protecting the rights of laid-off workers,
which indicated a gradual transfer of public attention from the problem of enterprise efﬁciency to
the problem of equality, which involves the vital interests of the common people.

performance during term of ofﬁce, tried to implement the system of job posting in
personnel management, and tried to implement the system of board of directors
where the outside directors were the majority. Besides, the SASAC further pro-
moted the reform of corporate governance structure, attempting to establish better
ﬁduciary relationships and principal-agent relationships in the mechanisms of
decision-making, supervision and incentives. It also introduced regulations about
the qualiﬁcations, appointment, rewards, rights and obligations of outside directors.
However, the above-mentioned measures seem to indicate that most of the
reform targets were still centered around the arrangements of rights and organiza-
tion at the managerial core of the enterprise, very few of them were directly related
to the workers. The debates in the academia and even among common people,
which were triggered by property rights transactions, mainly focused on the dis-
advantaged groups, while paying little attention to the substantive arrangements
about the workers’ rights within the enterprise. In fact, at this stage, it was changes
in the external environment of the enterprise that helped to draw people’s attention
to the problem of the workers’ rights. Firstly, the central government began to
advocate public services armed with new ideas of governance. Secondly, in the
process of gearing towards international standards, corporate social responsibility
became an important criterion.
All Chinese enterprises, no matter whether it is a private enterprise or a
state-owned enterprise, found themselves in this same situation of reform, which is,
promoting the concept of corporate social responsibility under the conditions of a
global market. The so-called “corporate social responsibility” (CSR) means that the
enterprise operates in ways that meet or even surpass the standards required by
ethics, laws and the public, and that it carefully considers its own impact on the
various relevant stakeholders while engaging in commercial activities. The concept
of corporate social responsibility is based on the idea that business operations must
be consistent with sustainable development. In addition to considering their own
ﬁnancial and operating conditions, the enterprise must consider its impact on the
social and natural environment, especially its impact on various stakeholders. The
term “stakeholder” refers to an individual or a group that is affected by the decisions
and actions of the enterprise, which includes but is not limited to employees,
customers, suppliers, community groups, parent companies or afﬁliates, partners,
investors and stockholders.36 Therefore, “corporate social responsibility” means
36Michael E. Porter and Mark R. Kramer recently published an article in Harvard Business
Review: “Strategy and society: the link between competitive advantage and corporate social
responsibility.” They proposed a brand-new perspective and pointed out that the relationship
between corporate growth and social welfare was not a zero-sum game. In fact, in this new era, if
companies can analyze and identify the social consequences of their business actions, can discover
opportunities to beneﬁt both the society and themselves, so as to determine which corporate social
responsibility (CSR) initiatives they should address, they will ﬁnd the most effective ways of doing
business. CSR should be perceived as an opportunity rather than as damage control or a PR
campaign. This requires dramatically different thinking—a mind-set, the authors warn, that will
become a decisive factor determining a company’s success in future competitions. See Porter and
Kramer (2006).

that under the market economic system, in addition to the responsibility of seeking
proﬁts on behalf of the stockholders, the enterprise also has the responsibility to
consider the interests of relevant stakeholders.37 The governance of enterprise labor
relations, in this regard, refers to the game and coordination among the internal
stakeholders of the enterprise, including the workers, managerial staff and stock-
holders. Among these, the worker’s interests are the most direct and most important
part of corporate social responsibility.38
It is under the dual requirements of corporate social responsibility that economic
globalization has produced reverse regulation effects on China’s economic activi-
ties. The legal environment of the Chinese market, as well as the enterprises’
internal technical, quality and management standards and their social responsibility
must be fully integrated with international standards. In particular, the SA8000
international standard provided regulations about the main contents of business
operation, such as company organization, suppliers/subcontractors, lower-level
suppliers, remedial actions, corrective actions, stakeholders and so on; it also gave
explicit deﬁnitions of child labor, forced labor, health and safety, freedom of
forming associations and collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary mea-
sures, working hours, salary and other aspects of workers’ rights. All these factors
actively or passively delimited the global business operation of the Chinese
enterprises.39 Since 2006, a series of corporate social responsibility laws, including
the Company Law, the Labor Contract Law, the Social Insurance Law, etc., have
been introduced; the Chinese leaders have also repeatedly stressed the importance
of corporate social responsibility on important occasions; the relevant central
government ministries have also taken initiatives to promote corporate social
responsibility within their scope of authorities. In 2009, the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology ofﬁcially included the promotion of corporate social
responsibility in its own functions. In May 2010, the Ministry of Human Resources
and Social Security issued the “Notice on Advancing the Collective Contract
System and Implementing the Rainbow Project,” and set the following targets: to
fully implement the collective contract system in all types of enterprises that had
already set up a trade union; to work hard to increase the coverage ratio of the
collective contract system in the small enterprises without a trade union through
signing regional and professional collective contracts. In September 2011, the
Ministry of Civil Affairs promulgated the “Guidelines for the Development of
Philanthropy in China (2011–2015).” Some other ministries and departments such
as
the
National
Development
and
Reform
Commission,
the
Ministry
of
Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Science and Technology, etc., also
actively engaged in the research and promotion of corporate social responsibility.
It can be said that, seizing the opportunities of social management and social
construction, the relevant government ministries increased technical investment in

labor governance, expanded some social support projects, and achieved some good
results. However, these governance techniques which primarily focused on
enhancing the regime system cannot fundamentally change the state of social mores
which was formed over a long period. It is difﬁcult for them to really enter the
enterprise organization to play an effective role, or to solve the fundamental
problems by starting from the enterprises’ internal labor relations. The primary ﬁeld
for the existence of corporate social responsibility is the protection of the rights of
the enterprise’s own employees. We can draw a conclusion from extreme incidents
of labor relations, such as the Foxconn suicides, that the governance of labor
relations must ﬁrst enter the interior of the enterprise, and must understand the
problem from the overall social responsibility rather than from simply the
capital-labor relationships. The essential questions are to understand the positions
and rights of the workers in different dimensions from the three perspectives of
possession, operation and governance, and to go deep into the enterprise to
understand its internal labor relations from the perspective of overall structure.
6.3.2
Workers’ Participation in the Enterprise
In 2003, the central government put forward the governance philosophy of “scientiﬁc
development,” in an attempt to deal with many prominent social problems caused by
the capitalized mode of economic development. Many of these problems were also
related to the administrative atmosphere that had been formed by the local govern-
ments since the 1990s, in which they only focused on economic growth, but paid no
attention to social justice; only focused on market operations, but paid no attention to
public governance. In addition, the Chinese enterprises, especially the private
enterprises, had very short growth periods, were subject to the inﬂuence of many
social factors in the process of enterprise restructuring, were too quickly geared to the
international market, and had very complicated relationships with various govern-
ment departments. For these reasons, they failed to establish a governance structure
with the coordination of labor relations as the core. Over the past three decades of
reform, especially since the market-oriented reforms of the 1990s, most Chinese
enterprises have been trying to optimize the corporate governance structure through
adhering to the principles of improving production efﬁciency and saving transaction
costs, and have been trying to integrate themselves with the international market order
in accordance with the logic of capital. As a result, the employees do not occupy a very
important logical or theoretical position in management and governance. The
opportunities and mechanisms for the employees to participate in business manage-
ment and enterprise affairs are not yet fully established.
In contrast, the participation of enterprise employees has undergone a long
period of development in the Western countries. In the capitalist enterprise system,
the Western societies have experienced hundreds of years of labor-capital conﬂicts.
Marx has profoundly revealed the secret of capital, that is, under the conditions of
the capitalist private ownership, the capitalists take possession of other people’s
174
6
Social Construction and the Governance …

labor without pay. He also pointed out that labor-capital relations are, in essence,
relations of class struggle. It was proven with facts that throughout the 19th century
the labor conﬂicts between industrial workers and capitalists had intensiﬁed to a
very serious extent. However, the development of the capitalist economy in the 20th
century has led to the continuous adjustment of the Western enterprise system, in
particular, changes in the internal participation mode, the democratic system and the
property rights relations of the modern joint-stock company, which has resulted in
the gradual relaxation of labor-capital relations. In his book, Democratic
Corporation, David Ellerman expounded his thought about establishing the
“democratic ﬁrm” with the employees’ property rights as the point of departure.40
The economist Weitzman put forward his theory of “share economy,” in which he
proposes an economic form of workers’ participation in proﬁt distribution and
revenue sharing, such as the bonus system, the dividend system and the proﬁt
sharing system, which converts the original ﬁxed-wage model to a sharing model
based on employee participation.41 The economist W. E. Halal went a step further.
He named a project for employees to become stockholders as “new capitalism” in
his book, The New Capitalism.42 More importantly, Theodore W. Schultz, Kuznets
and others put forward the theory of human capital, in which they regard the active
participation and creativity of the workers as an essential factor in economic pro-
duction and growth. In the view of Western scholars, “the central question in the
research on labor-capital relations is how cooperative relations, conﬂict relations
and power relations are formed between employers and employees, … The
employment relationship is both an exchange relationship and an authoritative
relationship: when the employees are paid wages or other beneﬁts, they also give up
control in the use of time and put it at the disposal of the employer.”43
As to the internal governance of the enterprise, some scholars treated employee
participation as the key to the problem, and designed different theoretical frame-
works to explain it. According to K. F. Walker, “employee involvement in an
enterprise can be deﬁned as the process by which employees at all levels, not just
the decision-making and managerial levels jointly participate in and realize the
business management functions of the enterprise.”44 This means that the employees
participate directly or indirectly through their representatives, in management
functions such as planning, organizing, directing, and controlling. Institutionalized
employee participation will, to some extent, change the balance of enterprise
decision-making,45 that is, participation itself has important implications for man-
agement and co-determination.46

In this sense, in the study of employee participation, particular emphasis should
be placed on the intentions, modes and effects of such participations. Starting from
this deﬁnition, participations can be classiﬁed into two main types: (1) inside the
enterprise, the employees directly participate or involve themselves in the man-
agement functions only in ways that are designated by the enterprise itself, for
example, the self-planning, self-direction and self-control in achieving individual
performance goals; (2) in internal or cross-enterprise ﬁelds, the employees partic-
ipate in the management functions through their representatives; this indirect mode
of participation goes beyond the individual level of the employee, and a type of
collective participation is realized through the form of employee representation. Its
fundamental demands are related to the overall interests of the employees, such as
wage standards and bonus distribution. This is a collective model of labor-capital
game play, which can be described as a process of joint regulation.47
In his book Human Organization, Likert summed up four basic types of orga-
nizational leadership. After this book was published, his theory became the basic
theoretical framework for analyzing employee participation. Likert pointed out that
in terms of organization leadership, the enterprises can be classiﬁed into two
leadership models, i.e., the model with the boss as the core and the model with the
followers as the core. The former model relies on the authority of the manager in
management, while the latter relies on the followers’ degree of freedom in man-
agement. Both models can be further divided into two smaller categories. In the
former model, the ﬁrst type is exploitive autocratic, where the business owner or
manager treats the subordinates in an autocratic manner; the second type is
benevolent autocratic, where the business owner or manager still adopts an auto-
cratic approach to have strict control over the employees, but never directly puts
pressures on them. In the latter model, the ﬁrst type is consultative, where business
owners or managers consult the subordinates for opinions and suggestions through
certain channels of participation, but still retain the power of making ﬁnal decisions;
the second type is participative, where business owners or managers not only
provide the employees with guidelines for overall participation, but also have all the
decisions made by the consensus of the majority of employees.48 It can be said that
the above discussion of Likert is an attempt to deﬁne the meaning of participation
and to determine the composition of enterprise organization entirely from the
perspective of decision-making (or co-determination), but in fact the meaning of
employment participation is rather complex, and decision-making is only one
important aspect of it.49
47See Briefs (1992, p. 104).
48See Likert (1961).
49Based on empirical data from surveys in Japan, K. Odaka deﬁned four categories of employee
participation: (1) Participation as suggestion. That is, in most cases, the employees as individuals
put forward constructive opinions on technologies, interpersonal management, and so on, to
inﬂuence decision-making. This is a speak-up model. For example, employee opinion surveys
belong to this type. (2) Participation as consultation. That is, the employees or their representatives
and the managers or their representatives hold discussions on the enterprise’s improvement plan
176
6
Social Construction and the Governance …

However, the above-mentioned views about employee participation are not all
that exist. Some other discussions tend to go beyond the perspective of organiza-
tional sociology and institutional sociology in its pure sense. They believe that
under the conditions of capitalization the relationship between labor and capital
cannot be reconciled in an absolute sense, this relationship is fundamentally a
contradictory relationship. A contradictory relationship must be resolved through
ways of contradiction, such as forming a collective entity for collective negotia-
tions, collective bargaining and collective struggle, so as to achieve the mutual
constraint and mutual restriction of labor and capital, and to realize the objective of
safeguarding the interests of employees.50 Moreover, this contradictory relationship
cannot be fundamentally resolved within the organization through an institution-
alized approach, and must rely on workers-based organizations outside the enter-
prise (such as trade unions) to engage in game play with the capital, or rely on state
legislation and political democracy in safeguarding the legitimate rights and
interests of workers.51
In fact, although the Chinese enterprises do not have a long development history,
and were repeatedly affected by revolutions and movements, the Chinese enter-
prises have experienced dramatic changes and rapid expansion especially in the past
30 years of reform, and have become an unprecedented phenomenon in the modern
economic history of the world. Although the Chinese enterprises had insufﬁcient
reform of the modern enterprise system, they have unique features of their own. In
corporate governance, they contain the traditional factors of social management and
social integration, yet they have been reinforcing the power of capital all the time.
More importantly, over the past sixty years the socialist political system and ide-
ology have formed a complete set of models of enterprise ownership and man-
agement, which have always dominated or permeated the governance processes of
all types of enterprises. Since the beginning of the 21st century, there have been
some new changes in the organizational form of corporate participation and gov-
ernance, which are particularly noteworthy.
Some of the macro factors that have contributed to this new trend have been
described above. On the one hand, problems left over from history by enterprise
restructuring need reasonable solutions. On the other hand, the bureaucratic reform
and reform agenda. Although the ﬁnal decision or resolution of the enterprise is not made by the
employees, the employees can freely express their opinions, thoughts and criticisms, for examples,
the workers’ congress, the staff council. (3) Participation as co-determination. That is, the
employees and their representatives meet regularly with the managers and their representatives to
co-determine the regulations, rules and management decisions of the enterprise. In this case, to
participate in the enterprise’s decision-making process is not only a right of the employees, but
also their obligation; the enterprise also provides institutional guarantees for this process.
(4) Participation as self-government. That is, groups of employees have full rights to make
decisions in the operation and management, and share the management rights of the enterprise.
Examples for this type range from project teams to employees’ self-government committees. See
Odaka (1975).
50See Crouch (1979), Webb and Beatrice (1920), Dunning (1860).

promoted by the government has also enhanced the tendency of rationalization in
corporate governance, and the government’s initiative of “making government
affairs public” and the enterprises’ attempt at “making enterprise affairs public” go
side by side. First of all, since the beginning of the 21st century, the path of
state-owned enterprise reform has undergone some important changes. The reform
discourse centering on “property rights” and “market” is gradually replaced by the
new discourse emphasizing “protection of workers’ interests” and “workers’ par-
ticipation in governance.” The reform has begun to carefully deal with and adjust
the interest relationships among the four sides of the state, the enterprises, the
workers and the managers.
Secondly, in 2003, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration
Commission (SASAC) was established, which laid emphasis on further deepening
the reform of state-owned enterprises. However, in its policies, the focus was not
limited to property rights and business efﬁciency; problems concerning the workers’
interests and corporate governance were also put in very prominent positions. “The
Opinions on Further Standardizing the Reform of State-owned Enterprises,” here-
inafter referred to as the “Opinions,” was promulgated in 2005. The “Opinions”
associates “safeguarding national interests and preventing the loss of state-owned
assets” with “safeguarding the interests of state-owned enterprise workers.” It
further emphasizes the dominant status and role of the state-owned enterprise
workers in participating in state-owned enterprise restructuring. It also emphasizes
that state-owned enterprise restructuring is not just the business of government
departments and enterprise leaders, and that it cannot do without the support and
participation of the broad masses of workers. Therefore, a central theme of the
“Opinions” is what can be done so that the broad masses of workers can have the
right to know and the right to participate in enterprise affairs.
In a number of provisions related to this theme, the enterprise workers’ congress,
or the workers’ assembly, is again placed in a prominent position, serving as an
important platform for the decision-making of the enterprise. Signiﬁcant matters,
such as the enterprise restructuring program, the workers’ resettlement program,
enterprise development planning and so on, must be submitted to the enterprise
workers’ congress, or the workers’ assembly, for discussion and approval. In the
process of making decisions on these important matters, the managers must listen to
the opinions of the masses of workers, and timely make known to the public the
results of audits and assessments of the main ﬁnancial indexes. In the aspects
concerning the rights and interests of workers, the “Opinions” has very detailed
provisions. For example, if a state-owned enterprise was transformed into a
state-holding enterprise, after the transformation the enterprise must continue to
perform the labor contracts with the retained workers which were signed before the
transformation. The workers’ working years before the transformation should be
added to the working years after the transformation in the calculation of length of
service for welfare distribution. The enterprise needs not pay economic compen-
sations to the retained workers. As for the workers who are no longer employed by
the enterprise, that is, whose labor contracts were rescinded when the enterprise was
restructured, the enterprise should pay them economic compensations. The holders
178
6
Social Construction and the Governance …

of the state-owned property rights of the enterprise must not force the workers to
use the economic compensation for investing in the restructured enterprise or lend it
to the restructured enterprise. At the time of enterprise restructuring, if the enter-
prise owed the workers wage arrears, money collected in fund-raising, medical fees,
misappropriated housing funds or social insurance premiums, the enterprise, in
principle, should pay off all debts in one lump sum. The restructured enterprises
should make timely arrangements to continue all social insurance relationships
required by state policies, such as old age pension, unemployment, health care,
work injury, child birth, etc., and make timely and full payments of various social
insurance premiums.
Indeed, in recent years, a series of regulations introduced by the central
authorities have strongly motivated the state-owned enterprises to further deepen
their reform of governance. Moreover, with the advancement of technocratic
governance and the introduction of international standards, the enterprises’ internal
governance structure and the level of employee participation have undergone great
changes, and some positive institutional innovations have emerged. As the Chinese
enterprises have experienced great vicissitudes in the past two decades, great
changes have taken place in the worker’s identity, rights, social security, social
welfare and other aspects. Therefore, a very important work in corporate gover-
nance is to redeﬁne the workers’ rights, or the system of rights concerning the
workers within the enterprise. Within the framework of the legal provisions of the
Company Law, the “Opinions” clearly deﬁnes the workers’ rights under the speciﬁc
historical conditions. Moreover, it can be seen from the above-mentioned clauses
that the workers’ rights in all the three dimensions of possession, operation and
governance are given clear descriptions.
In fact, participation in the enterprise does not entirely mean the bottom-up
(including horizontal) systems, mechanisms and actions deﬁned by industrial
democracy in the usual sense. Although employee participation is the opposite of
top-down domination and management, as an organizational behavior, it is a
legitimate pattern of behavior with authorization from higher levels. Organizational
authorization can take different forms, such as authoritative authorization and public
authorization. Participatory authorization refers in particular to certain “bottom-up”
processes of exercising one’s power after getting permission. It can include the
following situations. The employees independently choose, control and manage
their own work, or their group’s work; the subordinates exert inﬂuence on the
superior’s management; the employees exert inﬂuence on the decision-making over
enterprise affairs that are related to their own group. In this sense, the motivation of
employee participation comes from “joint efforts to be made, rights and interests to
be shared, whether from top or from bottom.”
Participation, as a functional requirement by the operation of the organizational
system, is a partial revision and functional change of the orthodox structure of
authority, without changing the basic appearance of the established authority
structure (e.g., “team,” “legal person,” “family,” etc.). In other words, it is the
organization’s new round of power allocation process “from decentralization to
centralization,” which can take many forms. Participatory decentralization refers in
6.3
The Public Governance of Labor Relations
179

particular to the transfer of decision-making “privileges,” which nominally belong
to the managers, to the subordinates;52 the ways of participation are determined by
the enterprise’s basic ownership structure; the systemic risk of the whole structure
cannot be avoided, but re-allocation of power and interests can be achieved by
modifying the organizational pattern. In this sense, employee participation is the
result of mobilization, activation, construction and sublimation of the workers’ will
to participate, to meet the demands of corporate decentralization. In other words,
employee participation is a collective action that is difﬁcult for employees to
complete independently. It needs the cooperation between the employees and the
enterprise. However, the reverse form of participation, or conﬂict participation, still
cannot be ruled out. Under the framework of enterprise authorization and decen-
tralized governance, it is possible to resolve the conﬂict through designing a
legitimate agency to represent the discontented and a cooperative mechanism, and
to integrate employee participation in the channels and framework of cooperation.
In short, as a social process of obtaining control and decision-making power,
participation is the allocation and exercise of power through a series of rules and
mechanisms designed by the organization or evolved from organizational traditions.
As an approach of organizational governance, participation is not a contingency, a
skill or tactics, but a mechanism of organizational governance and control. Its main
function is to stimulate the growth of positive relations between the enterprise and
its employees. It is a relationship of cooperative interaction under these circum-
stances: the employees identify with and remain loyal to the governance ideas of the
enterprise organization; the employees and the managers have mutual expectations
of each other. Only when the enterprise raises the employees’ wishes to the level of
corporate governance and reshapes them as corporate will, can participation be
really sustainable. This shows that, in the framework of governance, employee
participation is not a concept of pure morality, nor is it a concept of pure rights and
interests, it is rather a concept of governance. The concept of employee partici-
pation is not elitist, as the participation of a few elites is not believed to be critical
here; it is not purely populist either, but a result of their combination.
Participation means the downward transfer of the decision-making power over
corporate affairs, i.e., the decision-making “privilege,” which nominally belongs to
the manager, is transferred to the subordinates. It also means the most elementary
level of communication in the enterprise, similar to how an individual should
conduct himself or herself within a team or organization. Due to the existence of
different levels of participation, which lie on top of one another, there must be a
continuum of participation levels ranging from lower levels to higher levels; the
low-level participation might serve as “training sites” for higher-level participation.
For individuals, participation follows a principle of “appropriateness,” that is, the
behavior of participation takes place only when the employees have employment
stability, and higher demands than mere survival. The reasons are that, in essence,
participation is not a way to solve the problem of living, but an important factor in
52Pateman (2006, pp. 65–67).

individuals’ development capacity. In terms of organization, participation refers to
the possibility and rights for employees to participate in corporate affairs, partic-
ularly in matters directly or indirectly related to their own interests, through
organizational processes. For organizations, participation is the best way to achieve
governance, control, and identiﬁcation with the community culture.53
Out investigations show that, since the beginning of the 21st century, various
enterprise organizations have practiced and experimented extensively with insti-
tutions and mechanisms of participation. It can be seen from the observable facts
that the highest form of employee participation in the enterprise is the elitist rep-
resentative system, which adopts a voting system of co-determination for making
decisions on major issues concerning the management, reform and development of
the enterprise, on the construction of cadre teams, and on important matters related
to the vital interests of the employees. However, for most ordinary employees,
direct participation, or the so-called normalcy of participation, refers to exerting
independent and substantial impact on “things around oneself,” that is, the
employees’ own work and its extension process. Through this kind of low-level
basic participation, the employees can open the power space of participation, and
cultivate their ability and wisdom for “bottom-up” decision-making. In this sense,
the motivation of participation comes from “the elites and the masses making joint
efforts and sharing interests and rights.” Some enterprises have effectively extended
a certain degree of discussion rights and decision-making rights to all levels of
employee representatives through enriching the workers’ congress system and
establishing a permanent workers’ congress. In addition, some enterprises have
established a “grassroots mechanism” of participation at the most basic level, in
order to mobilize the masses at the grassroots level to participate extensively in
labor and life, in the daily affairs that are related to themselves.54
In contrast, a large number of private enterprises are more inclined to mobilize
non-governmental and traditional resources to develop the shareholding structure in
ownership relations, the local embedded social network in operation relations, as
well as the family-simulation mechanism in governance. For example, some private
enterprises resort to simulated kinship to establish natural intersubjectivity in the
shareholding structure, as well as a form of common ownership similar to “co-
partnership.”55

participation in the enterprise through the participation (shareholding) system; or
have used traditional system resources, such as the putting-out system, to fully
organize and mobilize scattered labor resources in the local communities and sig-
niﬁcantly reduce costs in operation and transaction; or have used the kinship
simulation mechanism to effectively deploy important personal relationships in the
enterprise.56 Because many private enterprises grew out of the original township
enterprises, although their property rights relations went through transformations
and the basis of collective ownership was removed, their ownership relations are
still complex. Especially in the shareholding structure, family relations, kinship
relations, geographical relations, etc., still exist in the complex allocation and
conversion of equities. In addition, they have carried on some old practices from the
past in business operation and in dealing with the local communities.

In the previous parts, we have seen that China’s labor issues have become
increasingly prominent in the background of rather severe labor-capital conﬂicts,
and have become the core concern of institutions and organizations at all levels
ranging from the state to the enterprise. Then, how can the rights and interests of the
workers be ensured with adequate institutional arrangements? In other words, how
can the workers achieve the expression, maintenance and realization of their own
interests; how can they achieve personal empowerment and make full use of their
rights?
In answering this question, the essential point is how the workers can obtain
their rights through the organization, or through what ways of organization. First of
all, from the perspective of the enterprise, although the enterprise has made certain
institutional arrangements in terms of human resources for the workers’ expression
and claim of interests, such institutional arrangements are completely based on the
business operation of the enterprise. This kind of individualized human-resources
arrangements cannot fully realize the workers’ rights and interests, and the workers
must adopt collective approaches to carry out collective consultations and collective
negotiations with the employers to achieve the balance of power between labor and
capital, and then to realize their interests and rights through a win-win approach.
Secondly, from the perspective of the state, although the state has gradually pro-
vided institutionalized administrative channels and legal channels for the workers to
express and safeguard their rights and interests, it is difﬁcult to imagine that the
workers could have direct contact with the state, or that the state’s direct contact
with the workers could become a normalcy. This precisely runs counter to the
56See Li Yingfei and Qu Jingdong, “Employee participation in the enterprise (Case 2): the pattern
of employee participation in a private enterprise—taking Company HX as an example.” The

gradual withdrawal of the state administrative functions from direct domination or
intervention in the economic and social ﬁelds. Therefore, the workers must par-
ticipate in the political process of the state through their own collective organiza-
tions, must participate in the state’s legislation and policy making to achieve
expression of their rights and interests at the state level, so that in turn they could
inﬂuence the balance of power between labor and capital at the enterprise level.
Therefore, after considering these two aspects, it can be concluded that the
expression of the workers’ own economic interests and political rights, especially
the latter, can only be achieved through organizational channels.
In terms of organization and institutional arrangements, China’s current labor
issues boil down to the issue of the Chinese trade unions, that is, how the Chinese
trade unions, as representatives and defenders of the workers’ legitimate rights and
interests, and as the only legitimate mass organizations of the working class in
China, can participate in the coordination of labor relations and in the state political
processes on behalf of the workers, and can ultimately achieve good governance of
the workers. However, how exactly the trade unions can facilitate the workers’
participation in governance and how exactly they can serve appropriate functions
do not have easy solutions. In fact, although the Chinese trade unions have always
stressed that they are representatives and defenders of the workers’ rights and
interests, their actual role and operating functions must be deﬁned and delimited in
accordance with the country’s speciﬁc political system and overall arrangements for
the workers. Moreover, to some extent it can be said that it is precisely because of
the tensions and contradictions brought about by the current transformation of labor
relations in China that the Chinese trade unions have become an important par-
ticipant in the coordination of labor relations. In other words, this transformation
gave the Chinese trade unions the opportunity to move from the “background” to
the “stage center” of labor relations, and to begin to play a substantive role.
The Chinese trade unions serve as an intermediary between individual workers
and enterprise organizations, between corporate governance and regime gover-
nance. This is the Chinese characteristics of the organizational system of trade
unions. Before the reform, the Chinese trade unions not only had an ambiguous
status, but also had to be extremely cautious in taking actions as if walking on thin
ice, because the establishment and adjustment of labor relations to a large extent
was a “state behavior.” “Even a little action could place the trade unions at the
opposite of the government; if not handled properly, they would be seen as an
opponent of the government, and would be labeled as engaging in syndicalism.”57
It is precisely because of China’s reform and opening up that “the workers’ speciﬁc
rights in employment, income, labor insurance and social welfare have changed
from the workers’ relationships with the state into their relationships with the
enterprise, and continue to develop in market-oriented and contract-oriented
direction.”58 In this process, the interests relations of the three parties, i.e., the state,

58Wei (1996).

the enterprise and the workers, were further differentiated and clariﬁed. The
workers’ status is no longer “state workers,” but enterprise workers.59 Against the
background of such interest differentiation, the trade unions’ status as a major
participant in labor relations became possible. Firstly, from the point of view of the
state, under the socialist market economic system, the kind of direct administrative
relationship between the state and the workers (its organizational carrier is the
danwei) has been “broken.” In a certain sense, the state needs a new form of
organization to achieve “setting up the party branch in the company” (organization
at the grassroots level), to realize the state’s socialist commitment to the workers
and protect them. In rather ideological wording, “the party and the state need the
trade unions to unite the masses of workers around the party and the government,”
and play a role in “reform, development and stability.”60 In other words, at the level
of state governance, the trade unions began to have a special status of their own,
that is, to participate in state governance as the representatives and defenders of the
workers’ interests. Secondly, from the point of view of the workers, they need an
organizational channel to realize the expression, integration and maintenance of
their own interests in the face of the dominant capital, not only at the enterprise
level, but also in the political participation at the state level. Finally, from the point
of view of the enterprise, it also needs to set up an institutionalized platform of
participation to achieve governance of the workers, and the trade unions often play
a constructive role of active cooperation and assistance in helping the enterprise to
establish harmonious labor relations.61
With the market-oriented transformation of China’s labor relations, tensions
arose between labor and capital, the workers’ interests were severely damaged, and
it became difﬁcult for the workers to effectively express and maintain their interests.
Against this background, China’s trade unions have increasingly become an active
player in the reform. It can be clearly seen that in the new historical period, the
Chinese trade unions have achieved a very important status in the process of
safeguarding rights and participation. They not only participate in the core-level
management of the enterprise, but also became an important force in organizing and
mobilizing employee participations at all levels and of all types. The revised Trade
Union Law was enacted in 2001. The new Trade Union Law broke the traditional
pattern where the four functions of the trade unions were given equal priority,
giving prominence to the function of “protection,” which is the focus of the trade
unions’ work in the market economy. Moreover, the new Trade Union Law also
made provisions on the two means for the trade unions to fulﬁll their basic duties.
That is, “the trade unions coordinate labor relations and protect the workers’ labor
59Zhang (1994).
60Zhang (1996).
61In fact, even in the history of syndicalism in the West, trade unions have increasingly become
“an essential part of the social control mechanism”, or a part of the “management and control
system” of the enterprises. Where the managers’ power cannot reach, trade unions can often help
train and discipline the employees. For details on this viewpoint see Hyman (2008).

rights through consultation on the basis of equality and the collective contract
system.”62
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACFTU) not only enhanced the supervision and participation functions of
the trade unions in state-owned enterprises, but also redoubled its efforts in setting
up trade unions in private enterprises.63
Over the past ten years, the ACFTU made huge efforts to promote the con-
struction of trade unions in the enterprises. The work of the trade union system in
the state-owned enterprises gradually recovered. In some private enterprise orga-
nizations, trade unions began to be set up. An organizational network of the trade
union system has been established through connecting the municipal and
county-level trade unions, township-level trade unions, professional trade unions
and other types of local trade unions. An effective interaction mechanism was
formed in the signing of collective contracts, the convening of industry-speciﬁc
workers’ congresses, the offering of legal aid, etc. Especially in the construction of
the modern enterprise system after the state-owned enterprise restructuring, the
trade union leaders became members of the leading group of the enterprise; trade
union organizations not only exerted inﬂuence on the business management of the
enterprise through the participation mechanism, but also went into various oper-
ating departments of the enterprise to serve managing and supervising functions.
The ACFTU vigorously promoted the construction of grassroots trade unions and
the building of trade union cadre team.64 In particular, to solve the problem of
difﬁculty in setting up trade unions in private and foreign-funded enterprises, the
ACFTU mounted a massive campaign nationwide of setting up trade unions, which
culminated in the successful founding of a trade union in Wal-Mart.
However, in comparison to the state-owned enterprises, although great
achievements have been made in the construction of trade union organizations in
the private enterprises, it is still difﬁcult for the trade unions to form relatively
independent departments within the private enterprises. They are heavily restricted
by capital in personnel arrangement, decision-making power and scope of
62See Jihui (2002), Zou (2001).
63In December 2003, at an enlarged meeting of the Third Session of the 14th ACFTU Presidium,
Wang Zhaoguo said in his speech, “In 2004, the trade unions’ work should focus on the following
key areas, strengthening the construction of trade unions at the grassroots level, giving full play to
the grassroots trade unions, showing solicitude for the workers’ production and life, safeguarding
the vital interests of the workers. In short, we should get organized and effectively safeguard our
rights.” That means the key points are to push the construction of the trade unions to the most basic
level, and to truly realize the slogans, “where there are workers, there should be trade union
organizations,” and “to maximally organize the workers into the trade unions.”
64The number of grassroots trade unions has reached 1.324 million, an increase of 12.7% over the
same period of last year. The total membership has reached 170 million people, up 13.1% over last
year, of which 40.978 million are migrant workers. A total of 61,000 trade unions have been set up
in overseas-invested enterprises (including enterprises with investment from Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan), the membership of which has reached 11.797 million. 54.5% of all overseas-invested
enterprises and 55.5% of their employees have been unionized.

functions. The enterprise trade unions can only participate in activities in some
areas of the workers’ production and life, which are often limited to non-signiﬁcant
affairs. As a result, it is difﬁcult to implement the internal participation mechanism
in the sense of governance. The trade unions often have little say in dealing with
signiﬁcant matters concerning the workers’ rights, such as wages, labor protection,
social security, work injury compensations and so on. Some trade unions even
become tools of the bosses to ease and suppress labor-capital contradictions within
the enterprises. Obviously, in the private enterprises which are controlled by the
capital, it is difﬁcult to form mechanisms of effective decision-making participation
and rights protection simply by relying on the enterprise trade unions. These must
be achieved through mandatory institutional constraints from the outside.
Protection of the workers’ labor-economic rights and interests includes active
participation in the promotion of employment and reemployment projects, safe-
guarding the workers’ reasonable wages (especially with regard to collective bar-
gaining and signing collective wage contracts) and social security rights, and active
participation in the protection of the workers’ rights in labor safety and health.
Protection of the workers’ democratic political rights includes the following
aspects. The ﬁrst aspect is to participate in the making of relevant laws, regulations
and policies, and to promote the establishment of the democratic workers’ man-
agement system with the workers’ congress as its basic form in enterprises and
institutions.65 The second is to organize and represent the workers in participating
in the management of social affairs and coordination of social interests. The third is
to participate in coordination of labor relations and mediation of labor disputes, to
promote the implementation of the labor contract system, to promote consultation
on the basis of equality and the collective contract system. The fourth is to
strengthen the trade union’s work of labor law supervision and participate in the
work of labor dispute mediation and arbitration, so as to provide legal aid services
to the workers. In short, the trade unions have moved from the background to the
stage center, which was an adaptation to the changes in enterprise ownership
relations and changes in the environment of governance. The trade unions should
become an intermediary between the individual workers and different social
organizations, and also become a pivotal hub for the communication between
corporate governance and state governance.
In fact, since the beginning of reform, China’s trade union organizations have
always been seeking their own positions in the changing overall social structure,
and trying to change their functions to adapt to the new circumstances. Today’s
65In the aspects of legislation and policy participation, the trade unions have actively participated
in the drafting and revision of laws and regulations including the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, the
Employment Promotion Law, the Labor Contract Law, the Social Insurance Law, the Labor
Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law, the Enterprise Wage Regulations, etc. The trade unions at
province and prefecture levels have participated in the development of 245 local laws and regu-
lations, of which 153 involve the rights and interests of employees, 40 involve the rights and
interests of trade unions. Besides, the trade unions have also participated in the development of
895 local regulatory documents (excluding laws and regulations).

Social Construction and the Governance …

trade unions cannot be regarded purely as a functional department afﬁliated to the
government in the overall system dominated by administration, nor is it the
spokesperson representing just one side of the labor-capital relations, rather it serves
as an intermediary between many social factors and many social ﬁelds. It is difﬁcult
for local trade unions to have unambiguous self-positioning like the danwei system
in the past or the representative of labor in the Western countries. There are no
longer very distinct barriers between higher and lower levels or between different
departments and regions in the administrative structure. However, at a time when
large numbers of social problems emerge and demand timely and effective solu-
tions, the trade unions’ ability to sufﬁciently utilize, allocate and coordinate various
government resources begins to grow. In this sense, the county-level trade unions
are no longer like a specialized functional department, but more like a mechanism
of organization, coordination and mediation, which mobilizes various government
resources to deal with the workers’ problems. Firstly, local trade unions are the
chief initiators and implementers in signing “collective contracts.” The trade unions
are responsible for appointing both parties involved in the collective contract, which
is, the business owners and the representatives of the workers, to sign the collective
contract. They also monitor the fulﬁllment and breach of the contract. Secondly, in
many places we have seen local trade unions (county federation of trade unions or
professional trade unions) organize the election of worker representatives, promote
the convening of industry-speciﬁc workers’ congresses, discuss and pass various
regulations and institutions related to the workers’ rights and interests in the par-
ticular industries. Besides, the local trade unions have also gradually added certain
arbitrational and judicial functions to its own, extending the functions of the trade
unions to the labor departments, judicial departments, etc. For example, they
appoint and organize personnel to participate in the work of labor conﬂict arbi-
tration and the labor court. Many factors have inﬂuence on the speciﬁc functions
and operating mechanisms of the trade unions at various levels. These include
different trade union levels ranging from the state and the regional to the grassroots,
the level of local economic development, difference in social structure, difference in
enterprise ownership system and other complex situations. However, we must point
out that, in principle, the Chinese trade unions at all levels have clear responsi-
bilities and duties: to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the broad masses
of workers by means of organization and in accordance with law. The changes in
the trade union organizations that we have mentioned do no refer to changes in
service tenets, but changes in functions and speciﬁc ways of functioning.
Although since the beginning of the 21st century, the ACFTU has been pushing
forward the above-mentioned undertakings, especially in setting up local and
enterprise trade unions and protecting the workers’ rights, we should not be
over-optimistic about whether the newly set-up trade unions can effectively perform
their functions. In enterprises with different ownership systems, the trade unions
vary greatly in terms of organization and functions. As for the state-owned enter-
prises, due to the original system structure and path-dependence, as well as the
construction of corporate governance in enterprise restructuring in the recent years,
their trade unions’ scope of functions have gradually expanded. Through some
6.3

speciﬁc cases, we can know more details about the role of the trade unions in
corporate governance, their functions in the state-owned property rights structure, in
enterprise management and enterprise governance, their innovative experiments on
employee participation and democratic procedures, etc. In the old industrial areas,
some enterprise trade unions are still endeavoring to solve the problems left over
from history by the enterprise restructuring in the end of the 1990s. However, from
the perspective of organizational structure and rights distribution within the
enterprises, the enterprise trade unions are still far from being able to include all
grassroots workers in the democratic channels of employee participation and
co-determination, not to mention those workers who are without a formal identity,
especially labor dispatch workers who are still basically excluded from the scope of
protection. In contrast to the state-owned enterprises, in most private enterprises, the
trade unions do not have real roles to play; they have not become an independent
department of corporate governance that participate in the management supervision
and democratic procedures within the enterprise; they cannot really fulﬁll the
function of protecting the workers’ rights and interests.

Chapter 7
Epilogue
In the 60 years after the founding of the People’s Republic of China, especially in
the 30 years of reform and opening up, China’s labor relations have gone through a
long and changeful historical process. From the co-existence of multiple economic
forms shortly after the founding of New China to the socialist transformation, from
the implementation of the strategy of national industrialization to the comprehen-
sive reform of production relations in the era of the People’s Commune, the reform
of labor relations has been the foundation for establishing the legitimacy of China’s
political system, yet it has also been a key factor causing the vicissitudes in China’s
politics and economy. But no matter how history evolves, China’s state system, that
is, “a socialist state under the people’s democratic dictatorship led by the working
class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants,” has always been and will
always be the system guarantee for the construction of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
Since the reform and opening up, China’s labor relations have undergone many
changes. In the 1980s, this was reﬂected in the contract system reform of the
township enterprises which were based on the collective ownership system and the
contract system reform of the state-owned enterprises which were based on the
public ownership system. Since the market-oriented reforms in the 1990s, changes
in the labor relations were reﬂected in the movement of huge amounts of rural
surplus labor, and in the large-scale lay-offs of the state-owned enterprises.
Although excessively intense market-oriented reforms facilitated the reasonable
allocation of resources, they also brought huge pressures on the adjustment of labor
relations. The outﬂow of the rural migrant workers and the separation of family
members had negative impacts on the rural communities, and further aggravated the
problems concerning agriculture, countryside and farmers. In the mean time, the
laying off and repositioning of state-owned enterprise workers brought huge
pressures on China’s social stability, and led to a series of problems which are still
unresolved today.

After the beginning of the 21st century, the state has made great efforts to
alleviate the contradictions in labor relations through legislation, legal aid, public
services, social security, policy protection, etc., and has achieved signiﬁcant results.
In the mean time, we must further study the internal labor relations of various
enterprises, their external system environment and their relationships with the local
communities, explore various social factors and historical resources for the coor-
dination of labor relations, so as to conduct the overall planning and all-round
construction of a new type of labor relations that suits the actual conditions of
China’s modernization development, and that can win the people’s support.
Over the past six decades, the changes in China’s labor relations have been rather
great, in depth and in scope. Generally, within a cycle of ten years, China’s labor
relations would experience fundamental changes due to changes in the economic
system and state policies. Especially in the 30 years of reform, because of the intro-
duction of the socialist market economy, the connotations of labor relations have
become increasingly complex. In this period, the socialist system factors, capital and
traditional factors have all combined in the formation of labor relations, which has
encountered huge challenges in both theory and practice. New problems and new
contradictions in the labor relations are mainly reﬂected in the following aspects.
The marketization reform was an all-round reform that was rapidly advanced in
the areas of property rights system, management system, employment system,
contract system, social welfare system, etc. These intense reforms have caused a
certain degree of anomie in the whole society.
The problems left over from history by state-owned enterprise restructuring, as
well as large numbers of labor-capital contradictions in the non-public sectors of the
economy, have transformed into labor disputes due to the lack of sufﬁcient and
effective mechanisms of interest expression and mediation. Although the state-owned
enterprises have greatly improved their economic efﬁciency in the recent ten years, the
poverty-stricken communities of the laid-off workers from the original state-owned
enterprises and other related problems have not been thoroughly treated. These
problems left over from the enterprise restructuring in the 1990s still exist today. Such
poverty-stricken communities are the main source of petitions and calls.
Hundreds of millions of migrant workers helped relieve the shortage of labor in the
cities under the market conditions, and indirectly increased the income of the rural
areas. However, from the perspective of rural families and rural communities, the
long-term separation of family members has caused serious problems for the rural
families and their children. Many rural families, even whole communities, became
empty shells, which are potential causes of dangers affecting social stability, and also
potential causes of problems in labor relations. The huge sacriﬁces made by the
migrant worker families must be treated with a comprehensive social mechanism.
In contrast to the rapid implementation of marketization, the laws, institutions
and cultural environment in support of the reforms were not effectively set up. Since
China was positioned at the low end of international division of labor, when the
logic of capital was given full play without any restriction, and when the enterprises
carried out harsh management of the workers without any adjustment mechanisms,
tragedies took place. A case in point is the Foxconn suicides. In the past, many
190

good mechanisms had great popularity in the Chinese enterprises, such as men-
torship, various industry-wide inter-enterprise activities, etc., which served the
function of alleviating tensions in labor-capital relations, like “lubricant and safety
valves.” However, these mechanisms, which generated abundant opportunities for
enhancement of emotional ties and solidarity, are rarely seen in today’s enterprises.
The laws and regulations related to labor relations are sometimes divorced from
the reality of social and economic development. For example, in the concrete
implementation of the Labor Contract Law, there were cases where the clauses of
the law lost touch with reality. In particular, many enterprises, including multina-
tional corporations and state-owned enterprises, took advantage of some ambiguous
stipulations, and used the method of labor service dispatching to infringe on the
rights and interests of workers. The phenomenon of “false dispatch” was even
worse. In “false dispatch,” the labor dispatch company took advantage of the
“triangular relationship” between the three parties, including the dispatch company,
the actual employer and the workers, and coerced the workers into signing a
contract with another labor dispatch company which had no clear working rela-
tionship with them and thus had no legal liability. This phenomenon caused event
greater damage to the workers’ rights and interests.
In addition, many people are still excluded from the social security system; the
society has a serious shortage of labor service agencies and labor mediation
agencies. The workers’ collective actions triggered by labor disputes are often
treated with a heavy hand, while little importance is attached to the timely allevi-
ation of the contradictions and coordination of social relations. These problems
require us to change our concepts and methods in the governance of labor relations.
In the mean time, these are also the aspects that urgently need to be improved in
social management and social construction.
In conclusion, in view of the 60-year development history of the Chinese
enterprises and advanced governance ideas from around the globe, we are conﬁdent
to say that we have many good traditions and good ideas of our own in the
governance of labor relations, yet we also have much to learn from other countries’
good experiences. Now the time has come for us to carry out overall planning and
all-round construction with a strategic vision in the governance of labor relations.
This requires us to take a holistic approach in studying the problems, probe into
their essential relationships, comprehensively investigate various factors, including
families, enterprises, social organizations, local communities, the state, etc., and
establish a new structure and new mechanism of labor relations coordination.
The governance of labor relations is an extremely important work that serves as
the basis of economic development and social stability. It is also a key component
of the national strategy of social and economic development. In the governance of
labor relations, we need overall planning, we need to integrate various relevant
social factors and mechanisms, and construct a structure of labor relations that
combines organizational participation, social support, public service and con-
struction of citizenship.
We should exercise organizational participation, that is, to adjust labor relations
from the “headstream,” because the social responsibility of the enterprise should be

ﬁrst implemented within the enterprise. The democratic governance inside the
enterprise has two aspects. The ﬁrst is to re-establish the system of workers’ con-
gress and set up various channels for employee participation. The second is to
effectively re-establish the good tradition of the modern mentorship, to build ties of
intimate interaction and professional inheritance, to prepare “lubricant and safety
valves” in the “headstream” for relieving contradictions in labor relations.
We should give further play to the mediating functions of the trade unions at all
levels, enhance the supervising and participating functions of the trade unions in the
state-owned enterprises, and in the mean time step up our efforts in setting up trade
unions in the private enterprises. We should achieve the situation of complementary
advantages between the trade unions and the party and government departments in
the governance of labor relations, and give play to the cohesive and coordinating
roles of the trade unions as an intermediary between different departments, between
the enterprise’s interior and exterior, between the enterprises and the workers.
We should further improve the legal aid services and the negotiation agency
mechanism for resolving labor disputes and labor-capital conﬂicts. Both normal
workers and workers who are involved in labor disputes need helpers in “safe-
guarding their rights.” The essential problems here are whether there is a helper,
whether the help is effective, whether the help is reasonable and in accordance with
the laws. Therefore, the essential approaches for relieving labor relations are to
effectively expand the ranks of legal aid services, to set up proper negotiation
agency teams, to establish public service mechanisms of multiple channels and
multiple forms for resolving labor disputes, and to diversify service agencies.
Importance should be attached to the establishment, supervision and adjustment of
the social security system related to labor relations. In the mean time, the solution of
labor problems should be sought beyond the enterprise organization; extensive
cooperation should be established between the enterprise and the local communities.
We should not understand problems of labor relations merely as problems of the
workers themselves, but should go into the workers’ families, and go further into their
communities. We should enhance social construction and social management, expand
their scopes, and form a protective belt of social support for the workers.
Because the evolution of China’s labor relations has lasted several decades, and
a large variety of factors concerning labor relations have been integrated, when we
face the future we also need to look squarely at our history. It is wrong to think that
what went out of fashion must be abandoned. In fact, various institutional resources
of the past are still useful and effective approaches for solving the labor problems
today, such as the role of the trade union, mentorship, the close relationship
between the enterprise and the local community, etc. We must gradually revive
these good traditions, and in the mean time keep to the pace of the times, go deep
into the realities, carefully investigate and research, and carry out overall planning
and all-round construction of a new system of labor relations that can meet the new
demands of social and economic development.
