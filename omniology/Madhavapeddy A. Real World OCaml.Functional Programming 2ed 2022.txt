Real World OCaml: Functional Programming for the Masses
This fast-moving tutorial introduces you to OCaml, an industrial-strength program-
ming language designed for expressiveness, safety, and speed. Through the book’s
many examples, you’ll quickly learn how OCaml stands out as a tool for writing fast,
succinct, and readable systems code using functional programming.
Real World OCaml takes you through the concepts of the language at a brisk pace,
and then helps you explore the tools and techniques that make OCaml an effective
and practical tool. You’ll also delve deep into the details of the compiler toolchain and
OCaml’s simple and efﬁcient runtime system.
This second edition brings the book up to date with almost a decade of improve-
ments in the OCaml language and ecosystem, with new chapters covering testing,
GADTs, and platform tooling. All of the example code is available online at
realworldocaml.org.
This title is also available as open access on Cambridge Core, thanks to the support
of Tarides. Their generous contribution will bring more people to OCaml.
Anil Madhavapeddy is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science
and Technology at the University of Cambridge. He has used OCaml professionally
for over two decades in numerous ventures, such as XenSource/Citrix and Unikernel
Systems/Docker, and co-founded the MirageOS unikernel project. He is a member of
the OCaml development team.
Yaron Minsky is Co-head of Technology at Jane Street, a major quantitative trading
ﬁrm, where he introduced OCaml, and helped it become the ﬁrm’s primary develop-
ment platform. He is also the host of Jane Street’s tech podcast, Signals & Threads,
and has worked on everything from developer tools to trading strategies.

Why OCaml?
Programming languages matter. They aect the reliability, security, and eciency of
the code you write, as well as how easy it is to read, refactor, and extend. The languages
you know can also change how you think, inuencing the way you design software
even when you're not using them.
We wrote this book because we believe in the importance of programming languages,
and that OCaml in particular is an important language to learn. Both of us have been
using OCaml in our academic and professional lives for over 20 years, and in that time
we've come to see it as a powerful tool for building complex software systems. This
book aims to make this tool available to a wider audience, by providing a clear guide
to what you need to know to use OCaml eectively in the real world.
What makes OCaml special is that it occupies a sweet spot in the space of program-
ming language designs. It provides a combination of eciency, expressiveness and
practicality that is matched by no other language. That is in large part because OCaml
is an elegant combination of a set of language features that have been developed over
the last 60 years. These include:
• Garbage collection for automatic memory management, now a common feature of
modern, high-level languages.
• First-class functions that can be passed around like ordinary values, as seen in
JavaScript, Common Lisp, and C#.
• Static type-checking to increase performance and reduce the number of runtime
errors, as found in Java and C#.
• Parametric polymorphism, which enables the construction of abstractions that work
across dierent data types, similar to generics in Java, Rust, and C# and templates
in C++.
• Good support for immutable programming, i.e., programming without making de-
structive updates to data structures. This is present in traditional functional lan-
guages like Scheme, and is also commonly found in everything from distributed,
big-data frameworks to user-interface toolkits.
• Type inference, so you don't need to annotate every variable in your program with
its type. Instead, types are inferred based on how a value is used. Available in a

2
Prologue
limited form in C# with implicitly typed local variables, and in C++11 with its
auto keyword.
• Algebraic data types and pattern matching to dene and manipulate complex data
structures. Available in Scala, Rust, and F#.
Some of you will know and love all of these features, and for others they'll be
largely new, but most of you will have seen some of them in other languages that
you've used. As we'll demonstrate over the course of this book, there is something
transformative about having all these features together and able to interact in a single
language. Despite their importance, these ideas have made only limited inroads into
mainstream languages, and when they do arrive there, like rst-class functions in C#
or parametric polymorphism in Java, it's typically in a limited and awkward form. The
only languages that completely embody these ideas are statically typed, functional
programming languages like OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala, Rust, and Standard ML.
Among this worthy set of languages, OCaml stands apart because it manages to
provide a great deal of power while remaining highly pragmatic. The compiler has a
straightforward compilation strategy that produces performant code without requiring
heavy optimization and without the complexities of dynamic just-in-time (JIT) com-
pilation. This, along with OCaml's strict evaluation model, makes runtime behavior
easy to predict. The garbage collector is incremental, letting you avoid large garbage
collection (GC)-related pauses, and precise, meaning it will collect all unreferenced
data (unlike many reference-counting collectors), and the runtime is simple and highly
portable.
All of this makes OCaml a great choice for programmers who want to step up to a
better programming language, and at the same time get practical work done.
1.1.1
A Brief History
OCaml was written in 1996 by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, and
Didier Rémy at INRIA in France. It was inspired by a long line of research into ML
starting in the 1960s, and continues to have deep links to the academic community.
ML was originally the meta language of the LCF (Logic for Computable Functions)
proof assistant released by Robin Milner in 1972 (at Stanford, and later at Cambridge).
ML was turned into a compiler in order to make it easier to use LCF on dierent
machines, and it was gradually turned into a full-edged system of its own by the
1980s.
The rst implementation of Caml appeared in 1987. It was created by Ascánder
Suárez (as part of the Formel project at INRIA headed by Gérard Huet) and later
continued by Pierre Weis and Michel Mauny. In 1990, Xavier Leroy and Damien
Doligez built a new implementation called Caml Light that was based on a bytecode
interpreter with a fast, sequential garbage collector. Over the next few years useful
libraries appeared, such as Michel Mauny's syntax manipulation tools, and this helped
promote the use of Caml in education and research teams.
Xavier Leroy continued extending Caml Light with new features, which resulted

1.1 The Base Standard Library
3
in the 1995 release of Caml Special Light. This improved the executable eciency
signicantly by adding a fast native code compiler that made Caml's performance
competitive with mainstream languages such as C++. A module system inspired by
Standard ML also provided powerful facilities for abstraction and made larger-scale
programs easier to construct.
The modern OCaml emerged in 1996, when a powerful and elegant object system
was implemented by Didier Rémy and Jérôme Vouillon. This object system was notable
for supporting many common object-oriented idioms in a statically type-safe way,
whereas the same idioms required runtime checks in languages such as C++ or Java. In
2000, JacquesGarrigueextendedOCaml with severalnewfeaturessuchaspolymorphic
methods, variants, and labeled and optional arguments.
The last two decades has seen OCaml attract a signicant user base, and language
improvements have been steadily added to support the growing commercial and aca-
demic codebases. By 2012, the OCaml 4.0 release had added Generalized Algebraic
Data Types (GADTs) and rst-class modules to increase the exibility of the language.
Since then, OCaml has had a steady yearly release cadence, and OCaml 5.0 with multi-
core support is around the corner in 2022. There is also fast native code support for the
latest CPU architectures such as x86_64, ARM, RISC-V and PowerPC, making OCaml
a good choice for systems where resource usage, predictability, and performance all
matter.
1.1.2
The Base Standard Library
However good it is, a language on its own isn't enough. You also need a set of libraries
to build your applications on. A common source of frustration for those learning OCaml
is that the standard library that ships with the compiler is limited, covering only a subset
of the functionality you would expect from a general-purpose standard library. That's
because the standard library isn't really a general-purpose tool; its fundamental role is
in bootstrapping the compiler, and has been purposefully kept small and portable.
Happily, in the world of open source software, nothing stops alternative libraries
from being written to supplement the compiler-supplied standard library. Base is an
example of such a library, and it's the standard library we'll use through most of this
book.
Jane Street, a company that has been using OCaml for more than 20 years, developed
the code in Base for its own internal use, but from the start designed it with an eye
toward being a general-purpose standard library. Like the OCaml language itself, Base
is engineered with correctness, reliability, and performance in mind. It's also designed
to be easy to install and highly portable. As such, it works on every platform OCaml
does, including UNIX, macOS, Windows, and JavaScript.
Base is distributed with a set of syntax extensions that provide useful new function-
ality to OCaml, and there are additional libraries that are designed to work well with it,
including Core, an extension to Base that includes a wealth of new data structures and
tools; and Async, a library for concurrent programming of the kind that often comes
up when building user interfaces or networked applications. All of these libraries are

4
Prologue
distributed under a liberal Apache 2 license to permit free use in hobby, academic, and
commercial settings.
1.1.3
The OCaml Platform
Base is a comprehensive and eective standard library, but there's much more OCaml
software out there. A large community of programmers has been using OCaml since its
rst release in 1996, and has generated many useful libraries and tools. We'll introduce
some of these libraries in the course of the examples presented in the book.
The installation and management of these third-party libraries is made much easier
via a package management tool known as opam1. We'll explain more about opam
as the book unfolds, but it forms the basis of the OCaml Platform, which is a set
of tools and libraries that, along with the OCaml compiler, lets you build real-world
applications quickly and eectively. Constituent tools of the OCaml Platform include
the dune2 build system and a language server to integrate with popular editors such as
Visual Studio Code (or Emacs or Vim).
We'll also use opam for installing the utop command-line interface. This is a modern
interactive tool that supports command history, macro expansion, module completion,
and other niceties that make it much more pleasant to work with the language. We'll
be using utop throughout the book to let you step through the examples interactively.
1.2
About This Book
Real World OCaml is aimed at programmers who have some experience with con-
ventional programming languages, but not specically with statically typed functional
programming. Depending on your background, many of the concepts we cover will be
new, including traditional functional-programming techniques like higher-order func-
tions and immutable data types, as well as aspects of OCaml's powerful type and
module systems.
If you already know OCaml, this book may surprise you. Base redenes most of
the standard namespace to make better use of the OCaml module system and expose a
number of powerful, reusable data structures by default. Older OCaml code will still
interoperate with Base, but you may need to adapt it for maximal benet. All the new
code that we write uses Base, and we believe the Base model is worth learning; it's
been successfully used on large, multimillion-line codebases and removes a big barrier
to building sophisticated applications in OCaml.
Code that uses only the traditional compiler standard library will always exist,
but there are other online resources for learning how that works. Real World OCaml
focuses on the techniques the authors have used in their personal experience to construct
scalable, robust software systems.

1.2.1
What to Expect
Real World OCaml is split into three parts:
• Part I covers the language itself, opening with a guided tour designed to provide a
quick sketch of the language. Don't expect to understand everything in the tour;
it's meant to give you a taste of many dierent aspects of the language, but the
ideas covered there will be explained in more depth in the chapters that follow.
After covering the core language, Part I then moves onto more advanced
features like modules, functors, and objects, which may take some time to digest.
Understanding these concepts is important, though. These ideas will put you in
good stead even beyond OCaml when switching to other modern languages, many
of which have drawn inspiration from ML.
• Part II builds on the basics by working through useful tools and techniques for
addressing common practical applications, from command-line parsing to asyn-
chronous network programming. Along the way, you'll see how some of the
concepts from Part I are glued together into real libraries and tools that combine
dierent features of the language to good eect.
• Part III discusses OCaml's runtime system and compiler toolchain. It is remarkably
simple when compared to some other language implementations (such as Java's or
.NET's CLR). Reading this part will enable you to build very-high-performance
systems, or to interface with C libraries. This is also where we talk about proling
and debugging techniques using tools such as GNU gdb.
1.2.2
Installation Instructions
Real World OCaml uses some tools that we've developed while writing this book.
Some of these resulted in improvements to the OCaml compiler, which means that you
will need to ensure that you have an up-to-date development environment (using the
4.13.1 version of the compiler). The installation process is largely automated through
the opam package manager. Instructions on how to set it up and what packages to
install can be found at the installation page3.
Some of the libraries we use, notably Base, work anywhere OCaml does, and in
particular work on Windows and JavaScript. The examples in Part I of the book will
for the most part stick to such highly portable libraries. Some of the libraries used,
however, require a UNIX based operating system, and so only work on systems like
macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
Core and Async are notable examples here.
This book is not intended as a reference manual. We aim to teach you about the
language as well as the libraries, tools, and techniques that will help you be a more
eective OCaml programmer. But it's no replacement for API documentation or the
OCaml manual and man pages. You can nd documentation for all of the libraries and
tools referenced in the book online4.

A Guided Tour
This chapter gives an overview of OCaml by walking through a series of small examples
that cover most of the major features of the language. This should provide a sense of
what OCaml can do, without getting too deep into any one topic.
Throughout the book we're going to use Base, a more full-featured and capable
replacement for OCaml's standard library. We'll also use utop, a shell that lets you
type in expressions and evaluate them interactively. utop is an easier-to-use version of
OCaml's standard toplevel (which you can start by typing ocaml at the command line).
These instructions will assume you're using utop, but the ordinary toplevel should
mostly work ne.
Before going any further, make sure you've followed the steps in the installation
page1.
Base and Core
Base comes along with another, yet more extensive standard library replacement, called
Core. We're going to mostly stick to Base, but it's worth understanding the dierences
between these libraries.
• Base is designed to be lightweight, portable, and stable, while providing all of the
fundamentals you need from a standard library. It comes with a minimum of
external dependencies, so Base just takes seconds to build and install.
• Core extends Base in a number of ways: it adds new data structures, like heaps, hash-
sets, and functional queues; it provides types to represent times and time-zones;
well-integrated support for ecient binary serializers; and much more. At the
same time, it has many more dependencies, and so takes longer to build, and will
add more to the size of your executables.
As of the version of Base and Core used in this book (version v0.14), Core is
less portable than Base, running only on UNIX-like systems. For that reason, there is
another package, Core_kernel, which is the portable subset of Core. That said, in the
latest stable release, v0.15 (which was released too late to be adopted for this edition
of the book) Core is portable, and Core_kernel has been deprecated. Given that, we
don't use Core_kernel in this text.

A Guided Tour
Before getting started, make sure you have a working OCaml installation so you can
try out the examples as you read through the chapter.
2.1
OCaml as a Calculator
Our rst step is to open Base:
# open Base;;
By opening Base, we make the denitions it contains available without having to
reference Base explicitly. This is required for many of the examples in the tour and in
the remainder of the book.
Now let's try a few simple numerical calculations:
# 3 + 4;;
- : int = 7
# 8 / 3;;
- : int = 2
# 3.5 +. 6.;;
- : float = 9.5
# 30_000_000 / 300_000;;
- : int = 100
# 3 * 5 > 14;;
- : bool = true
By and large, this is pretty similar to what you'd nd in any programming language,
but a few things jump right out at you:
• We needed to type ;; in order to tell the toplevel that it should evaluate an expression.
This is a peculiarity of the toplevel that is not required in standalone programs
(though it is sometimes helpful to include ;; to improve OCaml's error reporting,
by making it more explicit where a given top-level declaration was intended to
end).
• After evaluating an expression, the toplevel rst prints the type of the result, and
then prints the result itself.
• OCaml allows you to place underscores in the middle of numeric literals to improve
readability. Note that underscores can be placed anywhere within a number, not
just every three digits.
• OCaml carefully distinguishes between float, the type for oating-point numbers,
and int, the type for integers. The types have dierent literals (6. instead of 6)
and dierent inx operators (+. instead of +), and OCaml doesn't automatically
cast between these types. This can be a bit of a nuisance, but it has its benets,
since it prevents some kinds of bugs that arise in other languages due to unex-
pected dierences between the behavior of int and float. For example, in many
languages, 1 / 3 is zero, but 1.0 /. 3.0 is a third. OCaml requires you to be
explicit about which operation you're using.
We can also create a variable to name the value of a given expression, using the let
keyword. This is known as a let binding:

2.2 Functions and Type Inference
11
# let x = 3 + 4;;
val x : int = 7
# let y = x + x;;
val y : int = 14
After a new variable is created, the toplevel tells us the name of the variable (x or
y), in addition to its type (int) and value (7 or 14).
Note that there are some constraints on what identiers can be used for variable
names. Punctuation is excluded, except for _ and ', and variables must start with a
lowercase letter or an underscore. Thus, these are legal:
# let x7 = 3 + 4;;
val x7 : int = 7
# let x_plus_y = x + y;;
val x_plus_y : int = 21
# let x' = x + 1;;
val x' : int = 8
The following examples, however, are not legal:
# let Seven = 3 + 4;;
Line 1, characters 5-10:
Error: Unbound constructor Seven
# let 7x = 7;;
Line 1, characters 5-7:
Error: Unknown modifier 'x' for literal 7x
# let x-plus-y = x + y;;
Line 1, characters 7-11:
Error: Syntax error
This highlights that variables can't be capitalized, can't begin with numbers, and
can't contain dashes.
2.2
Functions and Type Inference
The let syntax can also be used to dene a function:
# let square x = x * x;;
val square : int -> int = <fun>
# square 2;;
- : int = 4
# square (square 2);;
- : int = 16
Functions in OCaml are values like any other, which is why we use the let keyword
to bind a function to a variable name, just as we use let to bind a simple value like an
integer to a variable name. When using let to dene a function, the rst identier after
the let is the function name, and each subsequent identier is a dierent argument to
the function. Thus, square is a function with a single argument.
Now that we're creating more interesting values like functions, the types have gotten
more interesting too. int -> int is a function type, in this case indicating a function
that takes an int and returns an int. We can also write functions that take multiple
arguments. (Reminder: Don't forget open Base, or these examples won't work!)

12
A Guided Tour
# let ratio x y =
Float.of_int x /. Float.of_int y;;
val ratio : int -> int -> float = <fun>
# ratio 4 7;;
- : float = 0.571428571428571397
Note that in OCaml, function arguments are separated by spaces instead of by
parentheses and commas, which is more like the UNIX shell than it is like traditional
programming languages such as Python or Java.
The preceding example also happens to be our rst use of modules. Here,
Float.of_int refers to the of_int function contained in the Float module. This
is dierent from what you might expect from an object-oriented language, where dot-
notation is typically used for accessing a method of an object. Note that module names
always start with a capital letter.
Modules can also be opened to make their contents available without explicitly
qualifying by the module name. We did that once already, when we opened Base
earlier. We can use that to make this code a little easier to read, both avoiding the
repetition of Float above, and avoiding use of the slightly awkward /. operator. In
the following example, we open the Float.O module, which has a bunch of useful
operators and functions that are designed to be used in this kind of context. Note that
this causes the standard int-only arithmetic operators to be shadowed locally.
# let ratio x y =
let open Float.O in
of_int x / of_int y;;
val ratio : int -> int -> float = <fun>
We used a slightly dierent syntax for opening the module, since we were only
opening it in the local scope inside the denition of ratio. There's also a more concise
syntax for local opens, as you can see here.
# let ratio x y =
Float.O.(of_int x / of_int y);;
val ratio : int -> int -> float = <fun>
The notation for the type-signature of a multiargument function may be a little
surprising at rst, but we'll explain where it comes from when we get to function
currying in Chapter 3.2.2 (Multiargument Functions). For the moment, think of the
arrows as separating dierent arguments of the function, with the type after the nal
arrow being the return value. Thus, int -> int -> float describes a function that
takes two int arguments and returns a float.
We can also write functions that take other functions as arguments. Here's an
example of a function that takes three arguments: a test function and two integer
arguments. The function returns the sum of the integers that pass the test:
# let sum_if_true test first second =
(if test first then first else 0)
+ (if test second then second else 0);;
val sum_if_true : (int -> bool) -> int -> int -> int = <fun>
If we look at the inferred type signature in detail, we see that the rst argument

2.2 Type Inference
13
is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean, and that the remaining two
arguments are integers. Here's an example of this function in action:
# let even x =
x % 2 = 0;;
val even : int -> bool = <fun>
# sum_if_true even 3 4;;
- : int = 4
# sum_if_true even 2 4;;
- : int = 6
Note that in the denition of even, we used = in two dierent ways: once as part
of the let binding that separates the thing being dened from its denition; and once
as an equality test, when comparing x % 2 to 0. These are very dierent operations
despite the fact that they share some syntax.
2.2.1
Type Inference
As the types we encounter get more complicated, you might ask yourself how OCaml is
able to gure them out, given that we didn't write down any explicit type information.
OCaml determines the type of an expression using a technique called type inference,
by which the type of an expression is inferred from the available type information
about the components of that expression.
As an example, let's walk through the process of inferring the type of sum_if_true:
1.. OCaml requires that both branches of an if expression have the same type, so the
expression
if test first then first else 0
requires that first must be the same type as 0, and so first must be of type int.
Similarly, from
if test second then second else 0
we can infer that second has type int.
2.. test is passed first as an argument. Since first has type int, the input type of
test must be int.
3.. test first is used as the condition in an if expression, so the return type of test
must be bool.
4.. The fact that + returns int implies that the return value of sum_if_true must be int.
Together, that nails down the types of all the variables, which determines the overall
type of sum_if_true.
Over time, you'll build a rough intuition for how the OCaml inference engine works,
which makes it easier to reason through your programs. You can also make it easier to
understand the types of a given expression by adding explicit type annotations. These
annotations don't change the behavior of an OCaml program, but they can serve as
useful documentation, as well as catch unintended type changes. They can also be
helpful in guring out why a given piece of code fails to compile.
Here's an annotated version of sum_if_true:

14
A Guided Tour
# let sum_if_true (test : int -> bool) (x : int) (y : int) : int =
(if test x then x else 0)
+ (if test y then y else 0);;
val sum_if_true : (int -> bool) -> int -> int -> int = <fun>
In the above, we've marked every argument to the function with its type, with the
nal annotation indicating the type of the return value. Such type annotations can be
placed on any expression in an OCaml program.
2.2.2
Inferring Generic Types
Sometimes, there isn't enough information to fully determine the concrete type of a
given value. Consider this function..
# let first_if_true test x y =
if test x then x else y;;
val first_if_true : ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> 'a -> 'a = <fun>
first_if_true takes as its arguments a function test, and two values, x and y,
where x is to be returned if test x evaluates to true, and y otherwise. So what's the
type of the x argument to first_if_true? There are no obvious clues such as arithmetic
operators or literals to narrow it down. That makes it seem like first_if_true would
work on values of any type.
Indeed, if we look at the type returned by the toplevel, we see that rather than choose
a single concrete type, OCaml has introduced a type variable 'a to express that the
type is generic. (You can tell it's a type variable by the leading single quote mark.) In
particular, the type of the test argument is ('a -> bool), which means that test is
a one-argument function whose return value is bool and whose argument could be of
any type 'a. But, whatever type 'a is, it has to be the same as the type of the other two
arguments, x and y, and of the return value of first_if_true. This kind of genericity
is called parametric polymorphism because it works by parameterizing the type in
question with a type variable. It is very similar to generics in C# and Java.
Because the type of first_if_true is generic, we can write this:
# let long_string s = String.length s > 6;;
val long_string : string -> bool = <fun>
# first_if_true long_string "short" "loooooong";;
- : string = "loooooong"
As well as this:
# let big_number x = x > 3;;
val big_number : int -> bool = <fun>
# first_if_true big_number 4 3;;
- : int = 4
Both long_string and big_number are functions, and each is passed to
first_if_true with two other arguments of the appropriate type (strings in the rst
example, and integers in the second). But we can't mix and match two dierent concrete
types for 'a in the same use of first_if_true:

2.3 Tuples
15
# first_if_true big_number "short" "loooooong";;
Line 1, characters 26-33:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
int
In this example, big_number requires that 'a be instantiated as int, whereas "short"
and "loooooong" require that 'a be instantiated as string, and they can't both be right
at the same time.
Type Errors Versus Exceptions
There's a big dierence in OCaml between errors that are caught at compile time and
those that are caught at runtime. It's better to catch errors as early as possible in the
development process, and compilation time is best of all.
Working in the toplevel somewhat obscures the dierence between runtime and
compile-time errors, but that dierence is still there. Generally, type errors like this
one:
# let add_potato x =
x + "potato";;
Line 2, characters 9-17:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
int
are compile-time errors (because + requires that both its arguments be of type int),
whereas errors that can't be caught by the type system, like division by zero, lead to
runtime exceptions:
# let is_a_multiple x y =
x % y = 0;;
val is_a_multiple : int -> int -> bool = <fun>
# is_a_multiple 8 2;;
- : bool = true
# is_a_multiple 8 0;;
Exception:
(Invalid_argument "8 % 0 in core_int.ml: modulus should be positive")
The distinction here is that type errors will stop you whether or not the oend-
ing code is ever actually executed. Merely dening add_potato is an error, whereas
is_a_multiple only fails when it's called, and then, only when it's called with an input
that triggers the exception.
2.3
Tuples, Lists, Options, and Pattern Matching
2.3.1
Tuples
So far we've encountered a handful of basic types like int, float, and string, as
well as function types like string -> int. But we haven't yet talked about any data
structures. We'll start by looking at a particularly simple data structure, the tuple. A

16
A Guided Tour
tuple is an ordered collection of values that can each be of a dierent type. You can
create a tuple by joining values together with a comma.
# let a_tuple = (3,"three");;
val a_tuple : int * string = (3, "three")
# let another_tuple = (3,"four",5.);;
val another_tuple : int * string * float = (3, "four", 5.)
For the mathematically inclined, * is used in the type t * s because that type
corresponds to the set of all pairs containing one value of type t and one of type s. In
other words, it's the Cartesian product of the two types, which is why we use *, the
symbol for product.
You can extract the components of a tuple using OCaml's pattern-matching syntax,
as shown below:
# let (x,y) = a_tuple;;
val x : int = 3
val y : string = "three"
Here, the (x,y) on the left-hand side of the let binding is the pattern. This pattern lets
us mint the new variables x and y, each bound to dierent components of the value
being matched. These can now be used in subsequent expressions:
# x + String.length y;;
- : int = 8
Note that the same syntax is used both for constructing and for pattern matching on
tuples.
Pattern matching can also show up in function arguments. Here's a function for com-
puting the distance between two points on the plane, where each point is represented
as a pair of floats. The pattern-matching syntax lets us get at the values we need with
a minimum of fuss:
# let distance (x1,y1) (x2,y2) =
Float.sqrt ((x1 -. x2) **. 2. +. (y1 -. y2) **. 2.);;
val distance : float * float -> float * float -> float = <fun>
The **. operator used above is for raising a oating-point number to a power.
This is just a rst taste of pattern matching. Pattern matching is a pervasive tool in
OCaml, and as you'll see, it has surprising power.
Operators in Base and the Stdlib
OCaml's standard library and Base mostly use the same operators for the same things,
but there are some dierences. For example, in Base, **. is oat exponentiation, and
** is integer exponentiation, whereas in the standard library, ** is oat exponentiation,
and integer exponentiation isn't exposed as an operator.
Base does what it does to be consistent with other numerical operators like *. and
*, where the period at the end is used to mark the oating-point versions.
In general, Base is not shy about presenting dierent APIs than OCaml's standard
library when it's done in the service of consistency and clarity.

2.3 Constructing Lists with ::
17
2.3.2
Lists
Where tuples let you combine a xed number of items, potentially of dierent types,
lists let you hold any number of items of the same type. Consider the following example:
# let languages = ["OCaml";"Perl";"C"];;
val languages : string list = ["OCaml"; "Perl"; "C"]
Note that you can't mix elements of dierent types in the same list, unlike tuples:
# let numbers = [3;"four";5];;
Line 1, characters 18-24:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
int
The List Module
Base comes with a List module that has a rich collection of functions for working with
lists. We can access values from within a module by using dot notation. For example,
this is how we compute the length of a list:
# List.length languages;;
- : int = 3
Here's something a little more complicated. We can compute the list of the lengths
of each language as follows:
# List.map languages ~f:String.length;;
- : int list = [5; 4; 1]
List.map takes two arguments: a list and a function for transforming the elements
of that list. It returns a new list with the transformed elements and does not modify the
original list.
Notably, the function passed to List.map is passed under a labeled argument ~f.
Labeled arguments are specied by name rather than by position, and thus allow you
to change the order in which arguments are presented to a function without changing
its behavior, as you can see here:
# List.map ~f:String.length languages;;
- : int list = [5; 4; 1]
We'll learn more about labeled arguments and why they're important in Chapter 3
(Variables and Functions).
Constructing Lists with ::
In addition to constructing lists using brackets, we can use the list constructor :: for
adding elements to the front of a list:
# "French" :: "Spanish" :: languages;;
- : string list = ["French"; "Spanish"; "OCaml"; "Perl"; "C"]
Here, we're creating a new and extended list, not changing the list we started with,
as you can see below:
# languages;;
- : string list = ["OCaml"; "Perl"; "C"]

18
A Guided Tour
Semicolons Versus Commas
Unlike many other languages, OCaml uses semicolons to separate list elements in lists
rather than commas. Commas, instead, are used for separating elements in a tuple. If
you try to use commas in a list, you'll see that your code compiles but doesn't do quite
what you might expect:
# ["OCaml", "Perl", "C"];;
- : (string * string * string) list = [("OCaml", "Perl", "C")]
In particular, rather than a list of three strings, what we have is a singleton list
containing a three-tuple of strings.
This example uncovers the fact that commas create a tuple, even if there are no
surrounding parens. So, we can write:
# 1,2,3;;
- : int * int * int = (1, 2, 3)
to allocate a tuple of integers. This is generally considered poor style and should be
avoided.
The bracket notation for lists is really just syntactic sugar for ::. Thus, the following
declarations are all equivalent. Note that [] is used to represent the empty list and that
:: is right-associative:
# [1; 2; 3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: []));;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
The :: constructor can only be used for adding one element to the front of the list,
with the list terminating at [], the empty list. There's also a list concatenation operator,
@, which can concatenate two lists:
# [1;2;3] @ [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
It's important to remember that, unlike ::, this is not a constant-time operation.
Concatenating two lists takes time proportional to the length of the rst list.
List Patterns Using Match
The elements of a list can be accessed through pattern matching. List patterns are based
on the two list constructors, [] and ::. Here's a simple example:
# let my_favorite_language (my_favorite :: the_rest) =
my_favorite;;
Lines 1-2, characters 26-16:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
[]
val my_favorite_language : 'a list -> 'a = <fun>

2.3 Recursive List Functions
19
By pattern matching using ::, we've isolated and named the rst element of the list
(my_favorite) and the remainder of the list (the_rest). If you know Lisp or Scheme,
what we've done is the equivalent of using the functions car and cdr to isolate the rst
element of a list and the remainder of that list.
As you can see, however, the toplevel did not like this denition and spit out a
warning indicating that the pattern is not exhaustive. This means that there are values
of the type in question that won't be captured by the pattern. The warning even gives an
example of a value that doesn't match the provided pattern, in particular, [], the empty
list. If we try to run my_favorite_language, we'll see that it works on nonempty lists
and fails on empty ones:
# my_favorite_language ["English";"Spanish";"French"];;
- : string = "English"
# my_favorite_language [];;
Exception: "Match_failure //toplevel//:1:26"
You can avoid these warnings, and more importantly make sure that your code
actually handles all of the possible cases, by using a match expression instead.
A match expression is a kind of juiced-up version of the switch statement found
in C and Java. It essentially lets you list a sequence of patterns, separated by pipe
characters. (The one before the rst case is optional.) The compiler then dispatches to
the code following the rst matching pattern. As we've already seen, the pattern can
mint new variables that correspond to parts of the value being matched.
Here's a new version of my_favorite_language that uses match and doesn't trigger
a compiler warning:
# let my_favorite_language languages =
match languages with
| first :: the_rest -> first
| [] -> "OCaml" (* A good default! *);;
val my_favorite_language : string list -> string = <fun>
# my_favorite_language ["English";"Spanish";"French"];;
- : string = "English"
# my_favorite_language [];;
- : string = "OCaml"
The preceding code also includes our rst comment. OCaml comments are bounded
by (* and *) and can be nested arbitrarily and cover multiple lines. There's no equivalent
of C++-style single-line comments that are prexed by //.
The rst pattern, first :: the_rest, covers the case where languages has at least
one element, since every list except for the empty list can be written down with one
or more ::'s. The second pattern, [], matches only the empty list. These cases are
exhaustive, since every list is either empty or has at least one element, a fact that is
veried by the compiler.
Recursive List Functions
Recursive functions, or functions that call themselves, are an important part of working
in OCaml or really any functional language. The typical approach to designing a
recursive function is to separate the logic into a set of base cases that can be solved

20
A Guided Tour
directly and a set of inductive cases, where the function breaks the problem down into
smaller pieces and then calls itself to solve those smaller problems.
When writing recursive list functions, this separation between the base cases and
the inductive cases is often done using pattern matching. Here's a simple example of
a function that sums the elements of a list:
# let rec sum l =
match l with
| [] -> 0
(* base case *)
| hd :: tl -> hd + sum tl
(* inductive case *);;
val sum : int list -> int = <fun>
# sum [1;2;3];;
- : int = 6
Following the common OCaml idiom, we use hd to refer to the head of the list and
tl to refer to the tail. Note that we had to use the rec keyword to allow sum to refer to
itself. As you might imagine, the base case and inductive case are dierent arms of the
match.
Logically, you can think of the evaluation of a simple recursive function like sum
almost as if it were a mathematical equation whose meaning you were unfolding step
by step:
sum [1;2;3]
= 1 + sum [2;3]
= 1 + (2 + sum [3])
= 1 + (2 + (3 + sum []))
= 1 + (2 + (3 + 0))
= 1 + (2 + 3)
= 1 + 5
= 6
This suggests a reasonable if not entirely accurate mental model for what OCaml is
actually doing to evaluate a recursive function.
We can introduce more complicated list patterns as well. Here's a function for
removing sequential duplicates:
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
match list with
| [] -> []
| first :: second :: tl ->
if first = second then
remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)
else
first :: remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl);;
Lines 2-8, characters 5-61:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
_::[]
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
Again, the rst arm of the match is the base case, and the second is the inductive
case. Unfortunately, this code has a problem, as indicated by the warning message.
In particular, it doesn't handle one-element lists. We can x this warning by adding
another case to the match:

2.3 Options
21
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
match list with
| [] -> []
| [x] -> [x]
| first :: second :: tl ->
if first = second then
remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)
else
first :: remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl);;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
# remove_sequential_duplicates [1;1;2;3;3;4;4;1;1;1];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 1]
Note that this code used another variant of the list pattern, [hd], to match a list with
a single element. We can do this to match a list with any xed number of elements; for
example, [x;y;z] will match any list with exactly three elements and will bind those
elements to the variables x, y, and z.
In the last few examples, our list processing code involved a lot of recursive functions.
In practice, this isn't usually necessary. Most of the time, you'll nd yourself happy to
use the iteration functions found in the List module. But it's good to know how to use
recursion for when you need to iterate in a new way.
2.3.3
Options
Another common data structure in OCaml is the option. An option is used to express
that a value might or might not be present. For example:
# let divide x y =
if y = 0 then None else Some (x / y);;
val divide : int -> int -> int option = <fun>
The function divide either returns None if the divisor is zero, or Some of the result
of the division otherwise. Some and None are constructors that let you build optional
values, just as :: and [] let you build lists. You can think of an option as a specialized
list that can only have zero or one elements.
To examine the contents of an option, we use pattern matching, as we did with tuples
and lists. Let's see how this plays out in a small example. We'll write a function that
takes a lename, and returns a version of that lename with the le extension (the part
after the dot) downcased. We'll base this on the function String.rsplit2 to split the
string based on the rightmost period found in the string. Note that String.rsplit2 has
return type (string * string) option, returning None when no character was found
to split on.
# let downcase_extension filename =
match String.rsplit2 filename ~on:'.' with
| None -> filename
| Some (base,ext) ->
base ^ "." ^ String.lowercase ext;;
val downcase_extension : string -> string = <fun>
# List.map ~f:downcase_extension
[ "Hello_World.TXT"; "Hello_World.txt"; "Hello_World" ];;

22
A Guided Tour
- : string list = ["Hello_World.txt"; "Hello_World.txt";
"Hello_World"]
Note that we used the ^ operator for concatenating strings. The concatenation
operator is provided as part of the Stdlib module, which is automatically opened in
every OCaml program.
Options are important because they are the standard way in OCaml to encode a
value that might not be there; there's no such thing as a NullPointerException in
OCaml. This is dierent from most other languages, including Java and C#, where
most if not all data types are nullable, meaning that, whatever their type is, any given
value also contains the possibility of being a null value. In such languages, null is
lurking everywhere.
In OCaml, however, missing values are explicit. A value of type string * string
always contains two well-dened values of type string. If you want to allow, say, the
rst of those to be absent, then you need to change the type to string option * string.
As we'll see in Chapter 8 (Error Handling), this explicitness allows the compiler to
provide a great deal of help in making sure you're correctly handling the possibility of
missing data.
2.4
Records and Variants
So far, we've only looked at data structures that were predened in the language, like
lists and tuples. But OCaml also allows us to dene new data types. Here's a toy
example of a data type representing a point in two-dimensional space:
type point2d = { x : float; y : float }
point2d is a record type, which you can think of as a tuple where the individual
elds are named, rather than being dened positionally. Record types are easy enough
to construct:
# let p = { x = 3.; y = -4. };;
val p : point2d = {x = 3.; y = -4.}
And we can get access to the contents of these types using pattern matching:
# let magnitude { x = x_pos; y = y_pos } =
Float.sqrt (x_pos **. 2. +. y_pos **. 2.);;
val magnitude : point2d -> float = <fun>
The pattern match here binds the variable x_pos to the value contained in the x eld,
and the variable y_pos to the value in the y eld.
We can write this more tersely using what's called eld punning. In particular, when
the name of the eld and the name of the variable it is bound to coincide, we don't
have to write them both down. Using this, our magnitude function can be rewritten as
follows:
# let magnitude { x; y } = Float.sqrt (x **. 2. +. y **. 2.);;
val magnitude : point2d -> float = <fun>

2.4 Records and Variants
23
Alternatively, we can use dot notation for accessing record elds:
# let distance v1 v2 =
magnitude { x = v1.x -. v2.x; y = v1.y -. v2.y };;
val distance : point2d -> point2d -> float = <fun>
And we can of course include our newly dened types as components in larger
types. Here, for example, are some types for modeling dierent geometric objects that
contain values of type point2d:
type circle_desc
= { center: point2d; radius: float }
type rect_desc
= { lower_left: point2d; width: float; height:
float }
type segment_desc = { endpoint1: point2d; endpoint2: point2d }
Now, imagine that you want to combine multiple objects of these types together as
a description of a multi-object scene. You need some unied way of representing these
objects together in a single type. Variant types let you do just that:
type scene_element =
| Circle
of circle_desc
| Rect
of rect_desc
| Segment of segment_desc
The | character separates the dierent cases of the variant (the rst | is optional),
and each case has a capitalized tag, like Circle, Rect or Segment, to distinguish that
case from the others.
Here's how we might write a function for testing whether a point is in the interior
of some element of a list of scene_elements. Note that there are two let bindings in a
row without a double semicolon between them. That's because the double semicolon
is required only to tell utop to process the input, not to separate two declarations
# let is_inside_scene_element point scene_element =
let open Float.O in
match scene_element with
| Circle { center; radius } ->
distance center point < radius
| Rect { lower_left; width; height } ->
point.x
> lower_left.x && point.x < lower_left.x + width
&& point.y > lower_left.y && point.y < lower_left.y + height
| Segment _ -> false
let is_inside_scene point scene =
List.exists scene
~f:(fun el -> is_inside_scene_element point el);;
val is_inside_scene_element : point2d -> scene_element -> bool = <fun>
val is_inside_scene : point2d -> scene_element list -> bool = <fun>
# is_inside_scene {x=3.;y=7.}
[ Circle {center = {x=4.;y= 4.}; radius = 0.5 } ];;
- : bool = false
# is_inside_scene {x=3.;y=7.}
[ Circle {center = {x=4.;y= 4.}; radius = 5.0 } ];;
- : bool = true
You might at this point notice that the use of match here is reminiscent of how
we used match with option and list. This is no accident: option and list are just

24
A Guided Tour
examples of variant types that are important enough to be dened in the standard
library (and in the case of lists, to have some special syntax).
We also made our rst use of an anonymous function in the call to List.exists.
Anonymous functions are declared using the fun keyword, and don't need to be explic-
itly named. Such functions are common in OCaml, particularly when using iteration
functions like List.exists.
The purpose of List.exists is to check if there are any elements of the list in
question for which the provided function evaluates to true. In this case, we're using
List.exists to check if there is a scene element within which our point resides.
Base and Polymorphic Comparison
One other thing to notice was the fact that we opened Float.O in the denition
of is_inside_scene_element. That allowed us to use the simple, un-dotted inx
operators, but more importantly it brought the oat comparison operators into scope.
When using Base, the default comparison operators work only on integers, and you
need to explicitly choose other comparison operators when you want them. OCaml
also oers a special set of polymorphic comparison operators that can work on almost
any type, but those are considered to be problematic, and so are hidden by default by
Base. We'll learn more about polymorphic compare in Chapter 4.6 (Terser and Faster
Patterns).
2.5
Imperative Programming
The code we've written so far has been almost entirely pure or functional, which
roughly speaking means that the code in question doesn't modify variables or values
as part of its execution. Indeed, almost all of the data structures we've encountered are
immutable, meaning there's no way in the language to modify them at all. This is a
quite dierent style from imperative programming, where computations are structured
as sequences of instructions that operate by making modications to the state of the
program.
Functional code is the default in OCaml, with variable bindings and most data
structures being immutable. But OCaml also has excellent support for imperative
programming, including mutable data structures like arrays and hash tables, and control-
ow constructs like for and while loops.
2.5.1
Arrays
Perhaps the simplest mutable data structure in OCaml is the array. Arrays in OCaml
are very similar to arrays in other languages like C: indexing starts at 0, and accessing
or modifying an array element is a constant-time operation. Arrays are more compact
in terms of memory utilization than most other data structures in OCaml, including
lists. Here's an example:

2.5 Mutable Record Fields
25
# let numbers = [| 1; 2; 3; 4 |];;
val numbers : int array = [|1; 2; 3; 4|]
# numbers.(2) <- 4;;
- : unit = ()
# numbers;;
- : int array = [|1; 2; 4; 4|]
The .(i) syntax is used to refer to an element of an array, and the <- syntax is for
modication. Because the elements of the array are counted starting at zero, element
numbers.(2) is the third element.
The unit type that we see in the preceding code is interesting in that it has only
one possible value, written (). This means that a value of type unit doesn't convey
any information, and so is generally used as a placeholder. Thus, we use unit for the
return value of an operation like setting a mutable eld that communicates by side
eect rather than by returning a value. It's also used as the argument to functions that
don't require an input value. This is similar to the role that void plays in languages like
C and Java.
2.5.2
Mutable Record Fields
The array is an important mutable data structure, but it's not the only one. Records,
which are immutable by default, can have some of their elds explicitly declared as
mutable. Here's an example of a mutable data structure for storing a running statistical
summary of a collection of numbers.
type running_sum =
{ mutable sum: float;
mutable sum_sq: float; (* sum of squares *)
mutable samples: int;
}
The elds in running_sum are designed to be easy to extend incrementally, and suf-
cient to compute means and standard deviations, as shown in the following example.
# let mean rsum = rsum.sum /. Float.of_int rsum.samples;;
val mean : running_sum -> float = <fun>
# let stdev rsum =
Float.sqrt
(rsum.sum_sq /. Float.of_int rsum.samples -. mean rsum **. 2.);;
val stdev : running_sum -> float = <fun>
We also need functions to create and update running_sums:
# let create () = { sum = 0.; sum_sq = 0.; samples = 0 };;
val create : unit -> running_sum = <fun>
# let update rsum x =
rsum.samples <- rsum.samples + 1;
rsum.sum
<- rsum.sum
+. x;
rsum.sum_sq
<- rsum.sum_sq
+. x *. x;;
val update : running_sum -> float -> unit = <fun>
create returns a running_sum corresponding to the empty set, and update rsum x

26
A Guided Tour
changes rsum to reect the addition of x to its set of samples by updating the number
of samples, the sum, and the sum of squares.
Note the use of single semicolons to sequence operations. When we were working
purely functionally, this wasn't necessary, but you start needing it when you're writing
imperative code.
Here's an example of create and update in action. Note that this code uses
List.iter, which calls the function ~f on each element of the provided list:

Warning: the preceding algorithm is numerically naive and has poor precision in
the presence of many values that cancel each other out. This Wikipedia article on
algorithms for calculating variance2 provides more details.
2.5.3
Refs
We can create a single mutable value by using a ref. The ref type comes predened
in the standard library, but there's nothing really special about it. It's just a record type
with a single mutable eld called contents:
# let x = { contents = 0 };;
val x : int ref = {contents = 0}
# x.contents <- x.contents + 1;;
- : unit = ()
# x;;
- : int ref = {contents = 1}
There are a handful of useful functions and operators dened for refs to make them
more convenient to work with:
# let x = ref 0
(* create a ref, i.e., { contents = 0 } *);;
val x : int ref = {Base.Ref.contents = 0}
# !x
(* get the contents of a ref, i.e., x.contents *);;
- : int = 0
# x := !x + 1
(* assignment, i.e., x.contents <- ... *);;
- : unit = ()
# !x;;
- : int = 1
There's nothing magical with these operators either. You can completely reimple-
ment the ref type and all of these operators in just a few lines of code:
# type 'a ref = { mutable contents : 'a };;
type 'a ref = { mutable contents : 'a; }
# let ref x = { contents = x };;
2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance

2.5 For and While Loops
27
val ref : 'a -> 'a ref = <fun>
# let (!) r = r.contents;;
val ( ! ) : 'a ref -> 'a = <fun>
# let (:=) r x = r.contents <- x;;
val ( := ) : 'a ref -> 'a -> unit = <fun>
The 'a before the ref indicates that the ref type is polymorphic, in the same way
that lists are polymorphic, meaning it can contain values of any type. The parentheses
around ! and := are needed because these are operators, rather than ordinary functions.
Even though a ref is just another record type, it's important because it is the standard
way of simulating the traditional mutable variables you'll nd in most languages. For
example, we can sum over the elements of a list imperatively by calling List.iter to
call a simple function on every element of a list, using a ref to accumulate the results:
# let sum list =
let sum = ref 0 in
List.iter list ~f:(fun x -> sum := !sum + x);
!sum;;
val sum : int list -> int = <fun>
This isn't the most idiomatic way to sum up a list, but it shows how you can use a
ref in place of a mutable variable.
Nesting lets with let and in
The denition of sum in the above examples was our rst use of let to dene a new
variable within the body of a function. A let paired with an in can be used to introduce
a new binding within any local scope, including a function body. The in marks the
beginning of the scope within which the new variable can be used. Thus, we could
write:
# let z = 7 in
z + z;;
- : int = 14
Note that the scope of the let binding is terminated by the double-semicolon, so
the value of z is no longer available:
# z;;
Line 1, characters 1-2:
Error: Unbound value z
We can also have multiple let bindings in a row, each one adding a new variable
binding to what came before:
# let x = 7 in
let y = x * x in
x + y;;
- : int = 56
This kind of nested let binding is a common way of building up a complex ex-
pression, with each let naming some component, before combining them in one nal
expression.

2.5.4
For and While Loops
OCaml also supports traditional imperative control-ow constructs like for and while
loops. Here, for example, is some code for permuting an array that uses a for loop:
# let permute array =
let length = Array.length array in
for i = 0 to length - 2 do
(* pick a j to swap with *)
let j = i + Random.int (length - i) in
(* Swap i and j *)
let tmp = array.(i) in
array.(i) <- array.(j);
array.(j) <- tmp
done;;
val permute : 'a array -> unit = <fun>
This is our rst use of the Random module. Note that Random starts with a xed seed,
but you can call Random.self_init to choose a new seed at random.
From a syntactic perspective, you should note the keywords that distinguish a for
loop: for, to, do, and done.
Here's an example run of this code:
# let ar = Array.init 20 ~f:(fun i -> i);;
val ar : int array =
[|0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18;
19|]
# permute ar;;
- : unit = ()
# ar;;
- : int array =
[|12; 16; 5; 13; 1; 6; 0; 7; 15; 19; 14; 4; 2; 11; 3; 8; 17; 9; 10;
18|]
OCaml also supports while loops, as shown in the following function for nding
the position of the rst negative entry in an array. Note that while (like for) is also a
keyword:
# let find_first_negative_entry array =
let pos = ref 0 in
while !pos < Array.length array && array.(!pos) >= 0 do
pos := !pos + 1
done;
if !pos = Array.length array then None else Some !pos;;
val find_first_negative_entry : int array -> int option = <fun>
# find_first_negative_entry [|1;2;0;3|];;
- : int option = None
# find_first_negative_entry [|1;-2;0;3|];;
- : int option = Some 1
As a side note, the preceding code takes advantage of the fact that &&, OCaml's
and operator, short-circuits. In particular, in an expression of the form expr1&&expr2,
expr2 will only be evaluated if expr1 evaluated to true. Were it not for that, then the
preceding function would result in an out-of-bounds error. Indeed, we can trigger that
out-of-bounds error by rewriting the function to avoid the short-circuiting:

2.6 Compiling and Running
29
# let find_first_negative_entry array =
let pos = ref 0 in
while
let pos_is_good = !pos < Array.length array in
let element_is_non_negative = array.(!pos) >= 0 in
pos_is_good && element_is_non_negative
do
pos := !pos + 1
done;
if !pos = Array.length array then None else Some !pos;;
val find_first_negative_entry : int array -> int option = <fun>
# find_first_negative_entry [|1;2;0;3|];;
Exception: (Invalid_argument "index out of bounds")
The or operator, ||, short-circuits in a similar way to &&.
2.6
A Complete Program
So far, we've played with the basic features of the language via utop. Now we'll show
how to create a simple standalone program. In particular, we'll create a program that
sums up a list of numbers read in from the standard input.
Here's the code, which you can save in a le called sum.ml. Note that we don't
terminate expressions with ;; here, since it's not required outside the toplevel.
open Base
open Stdio
let rec read_and_accumulate accum =
let line = In_channel.input_line In_channel.stdin in
match line with
| None -> accum
| Some x -> read_and_accumulate (accum +. Float.of_string x)
let () =
printf "Total: %F\n" (read_and_accumulate 0.)
This is our rst use of OCaml's input and output routines, and we needed to open
another library, Stdio, to get access to them. The function read_and_accumulate is a
recursive function that uses In_channel.input_line to read in lines one by one from
the standard input, invoking itself at each iteration with its updated accumulated sum.
Note that input_line returns an optional value, with None indicating the end of the
input stream.
After read_and_accumulate returns, the total needs to be printed. This is done
using the printf command, which provides support for type-safe format strings. The
format string is parsed by the compiler and used to determine the number and type
of the remaining arguments that are required. In this case, there is a single formatting
directive, %F, so printf expects one additional argument of type float.

2.6.1
Compiling and Running
We'll compile our program using dune, a build system that's designed for use with
OCaml projects. First, we need to write a dune-project le to specify the project's
root directory.
(lang dune 2.9)
(name rwo-example)
Then, we need to write a dune le to specify the specic thing being built. Note that a
single project will have just one dune-project le, but potentially many sub-directories
with dierent dune les.
In this case, however, we just have one:
(executable
(name
sum)
(libraries base stdio))
All we need to specify is the fact that we're building an executable (rather than a
library), the name of the executable, and the name of the libraries we depend on.
We can now invoke dune to build the executable.
$ dune build sum.exe
The .exe sux indicates that we're building a native-code executable, which we'll
discuss more in Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and Programs). Once the build completes,
we can use the resulting program like any command-line utility. We can feed input to
sum.exe by typing in a sequence of numbers, one per line, hitting Ctrl-D when we're
done:
$ ./_build/default/sum.exe

a proper command-line parsing interface and better error handling, all of which is

Where to Go from Here
That's it for the guided tour! There are plenty of features left and lots of details to
explain, but we hope that you now have a sense of what to expect from OCaml, and
that you'll be more comfortable reading the rest of the book as a result.

Variables and Functions
Variables and functions are fundamental ideas that show up in virtually all program-
ming languages. OCaml has a dierent take on these concepts than most languages
you're likely to have encountered, so this chapter will cover OCaml's approach to vari-
ables and functions in some detail, starting with the basics of how to dene a variable,
and ending with the intricacies of functions with labeled and optional arguments.
Don't be discouraged if you nd yourself overwhelmed by some of the details,
especially toward the end of the chapter. The concepts here are important, but if they
don't connect for you on your rst read, you should return to this chapter after you've
gotten a better sense of the rest of the language.
3.1
Variables
At its simplest, a variable is an identier whose meaning is bound to a particular value.
In OCaml these bindings are often introduced using the let keyword. We can type a
so-called top-level let binding with the following syntax. Note that variable names
must start with a lowercase letter or an underscore.
let <variable> = <expr>
As we'll see when we get to the module system in Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and
Programs), this same syntax is used for let bindings at the top level of a module.
Every variable binding has a scope, which is the portion of the code that can refer
to that binding. When using utop, the scope of a top-level let binding is everything
that follows it in the session. When it shows up in a module, the scope is the remainder
of that module.
Here's a simple example.
# open Base;;
# let x = 3;;
val x : int = 3
# let y = 4;;
val y : int = 4
# let z = x + y;;
val z : int = 7
let can also be used to create a variable binding whose scope is limited to a
particular expression, using the following syntax.

32
Variables and Functions
let <variable> = <expr1> in <expr2>
This rst evaluates expr1 and then evaluates expr2 with variable bound to whatever
value was produced by the evaluation of expr1. Here's how it looks in practice.
# let languages = "OCaml,Perl,C++,C";;
val languages : string = "OCaml,Perl,C++,C"
# let dashed_languages =
let language_list = String.split languages ~on:',' in
String.concat ~sep:"-" language_list;;
val dashed_languages : string = "OCaml-Perl-C++-C"
Note that the scope of language_list is just the expression String.concat ~sep:"-"
language_list and is not available at the toplevel, as we can see if we try to access it
now. [let bindings/local]
# language_list;;
Line 1, characters 1-14:
Error: Unbound value language_list
A let binding in an inner scope can shadow, or hide, the denition from an outer
scope. So, for example, we could have written the dashed_languages example as
follows.
# let languages = "OCaml,Perl,C++,C";;
val languages : string = "OCaml,Perl,C++,C"
# let dashed_languages =
let languages = String.split languages ~on:',' in
String.concat ~sep:"-" languages;;
val dashed_languages : string = "OCaml-Perl-C++-C"
This time, in the inner scope we called the list of strings languages instead of
language_list, thus hiding the original denition of languages. But once the def-
inition of dashed_languages is complete, the inner scope has closed and the original
denition of languages is still available.
# languages;;
- : string = "OCaml,Perl,C++,C"
One common idiom is to use a series of nested let/in expressions to build up the
components of a larger computation. Thus, we might write.
# let area_of_ring inner_radius outer_radius =
let pi = Float.pi in
let area_of_circle r = pi *. r *. r in
area_of_circle outer_radius -. area_of_circle inner_radius;;
val area_of_ring : float -> float -> float = <fun>
# area_of_ring 1. 3.;;
- : float = 25.132741228718345
It's important not to confuse a sequence of let bindings with the modication of
a mutable variable. For example, consider how area_of_ring would work if we had
instead written this purposefully confusing bit of code:
# let area_of_ring inner_radius outer_radius =
let pi = Float.pi in
let area_of_circle r = pi *. r *. r in

3.1 Pattern Matching and Let
33
let pi = 0. in
area_of_circle outer_radius -. area_of_circle inner_radius;;
Line 4, characters 9-11:
Warning 26 [unused-var]: unused variable pi.
val area_of_ring : float -> float -> float = <fun>
Here, we redened pi to be zero after the denition of area_of_circle. You might
think that this would mean that the result of the computation would now be zero, but in
fact, the behavior of the function is unchanged. That's because the original denition
of pi wasn't changed; it was just shadowed, which means that any subsequent reference
to pi would see the new denition of pi as 0, but earlier references would still see the
old one. But there is no later use of pi, so the binding of pi to 0. made no dierence
at all. This explains the warning produced by the toplevel telling us that there is an
unused variable.
In OCaml, let bindings are immutable. There are many kinds of mutable values in
OCaml, which we'll discuss in Chapter 9 (Imperative Programming), but there are no
mutable variables.
Why Don't Variables Vary?
One source of confusion for people new to OCaml is the fact that variables are
immutable. This seems pretty surprising even on linguistic terms. Isn't the whole
point of a variable that it can vary?
The answer to this is that variables in OCaml (and generally in functional languages)
are really more like variables in an equation than a variable in an imperative language.
If you think about the mathematical identity x(y + z) = xy + xz, there's no notion
of mutating the variables x, y, and z. They vary in the sense that you can instantiate
this equation with dierent numbers for those variables, and it still holds.
The same is true in a functional language. A function can be applied to dierent
inputs, and thus its variables will take on dierent values, even without mutation.
3.1.1
Pattern Matching and Let
Another useful feature of let bindings is that they support the use of patterns on the
left-hand side. Consider the following code, which uses List.unzip, a function for
converting a list of pairs into a pair of lists.
# let (ints,strings) = List.unzip [(1,"one"); (2,"two");
(3,"three")];;
val ints : int list = [1; 2; 3]
val strings : string list = ["one"; "two"; "three"]
Here, (ints,strings) is a pattern, and the let binding assigns values to both of
the identiers that show up in that pattern. A pattern is essentially a description of the
shape of a data structure, where some components are names to be bound to values.
As we saw in Chapter 2.3 (Tuples, Lists, Options, and Pattern Matching), OCaml has
patterns for a variety of dierent data types.
Using a pattern in a let binding makes the most sense for a pattern that is irrefutable,

34
Variables and Functions
i.e., where any value of the type in question is guaranteed to match the pattern. Tuple
and record patterns are irrefutable, but list patterns are not. Consider the following code
that implements a function for upper casing the rst element of a comma-separated
list.
# let upcase_first_entry line =
let (first :: rest) = String.split ~on:',' line in
String.concat ~sep:"," (String.uppercase first :: rest);;
Lines 2-3, characters 5-60:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
[]
val upcase_first_entry : string -> string = <fun>
This case can't really come up in practice, because String.split always returns a
list with at least one element, even when given the empty string.
# upcase_first_entry "one,two,three";;
- : string = "ONE,two,three"
# upcase_first_entry "";;
- : string = ""
But the compiler doesn't know this, and so it emits the warning. It's generally better to
use a match expression to handle such cases explicitly:
# let upcase_first_entry line =
match String.split ~on:',' line with
| [] -> assert false (* String.split returns at least one element
*)
| first :: rest -> String.concat ~sep:"," (String.uppercase first
:: rest);;
val upcase_first_entry : string -> string = <fun>
Note that this is our rst use of assert, which is useful for marking cases that should
be impossible. We'll discuss assert in more detail in Chapter 8 (Error Handling).
3.2
Functions
Given that OCaml is a functional language, it's no surprise that functions are important
and pervasive. Indeed, functions have come up in almost every example we've looked
at so far. This section will go into more depth, explaining the details of how OCaml's
functions work. As you'll see, functions in OCaml dier in a variety of ways from
what you'll nd in most mainstream languages.
3.2.1
Anonymous Functions
We'll start by looking at the most basic style of function declaration in OCaml: the
anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function that is declared without
being named. These can be declared using the fun keyword, as shown here.
# (fun x -> x + 1);;
- : int -> int = <fun>

3.2 Anonymous Functions
35
Anonymous functions operate in much the same way as named functions. For
example, we can apply an anonymous function to an argument:
# (fun x -> x + 1) 7;;
- : int = 8
or pass it to another function. Passing functions to iteration functions like List.map is
probably the most common use case for anonymous functions.
# List.map ~f:(fun x -> x + 1) [1;2;3];;
- : int list = [2; 3; 4]
You can even stu a function into a data structure, like a list:
# let transforms = [ String.uppercase; String.lowercase ];;
val transforms : (string -> string) list = [<fun>; <fun>]
# List.map ~f:(fun g -> g "Hello World") transforms;;
- : string list = ["HELLO WORLD"; "hello world"]
It's worth stopping for a moment to puzzle this example out. Notice that (fun g ->
g "Hello World") is a function that takes a function as an argument, and then applies
that function to the string "Hello World". The invocation of List.map applies (fun g
-> g "Hello World") to the elements of transforms, which are themselves functions.
The returned list contains the results of these function applications.
The key thing to understand is that functions are ordinary values in OCaml, and you
can do everything with them that you'd do with an ordinary value, including passing
them to and returning them from other functions and storing them in data structures.
We even name functions in the same way that we name other values, by using a let
binding.
# let plusone = (fun x -> x + 1);;
val plusone : int -> int = <fun>
# plusone 3;;
- : int = 4
Dening named functions is so common that there is some syntactic sugar for it.
Thus, the following denition of plusone is equivalent to the previous denition.
# let plusone x = x + 1;;
val plusone : int -> int = <fun>
This is the most common and convenient way to declare a function, but syntactic
niceties aside, the two styles of function denition are equivalent.
let and fun
Functions and let bindings have a lot to do with each other. In some sense, you can
think of the parameter of a function as a variable being bound to the value passed by
the caller. Indeed, the following two expressions are nearly equivalent.
# (fun x -> x + 1) 7;;
- : int = 8
# let x = 7 in x + 1;;
- : int = 8

36
Variables and Functions
This connection is important, and will come up more when programming in a monadic
style, as we'll see in Chapter 17 (Concurrent Programming with Async).
3.2.2
Multiargument Functions
OCaml of course also supports multiargument functions, such as:
# let abs_diff x y = abs (x - y);;
val abs_diff : int -> int -> int = <fun>
# abs_diff 3 4;;
- : int = 1
You may nd the type signature of abs_diff with all of its arrows a little hard to parse.
To understand what's going on, let's rewrite abs_diff in an equivalent form, using the
fun keyword.
# let abs_diff =
(fun x -> (fun y -> abs (x - y)));;
val abs_diff : int -> int -> int = <fun>
This rewrite makes it explicit that abs_diff is actually a function of one argument
that returns another function of one argument, which itself returns the nal result.
Because the functions are nested, the inner expression abs (x - y) has access to both
x, which was bound by the outer function application, and y, which was bound by the
inner one.
This style of function is called a curried function. (Currying is named after Haskell
Curry, a logician who had a signicant impact on the design and theory of programming
languages.) The key to interpreting the type signature of a curried function is the
observation that -> is right-associative. The type signature of abs_diff can therefore
be parenthesized as follows.
val abs_diff : int -> (int -> int)
The parentheses don't change the meaning of the signature, but they make it easier to
see the currying.
Currying is more than just a theoretical curiosity. You can make use of currying to
specialize a function by feeding in some of the arguments. Here's an example where we
create a specialized version of abs_diff that measures the distance of a given number
from 3.
# let dist_from_3 = abs_diff 3;;
val dist_from_3 : int -> int = <fun>
# dist_from_3 8;;
- : int = 5
# dist_from_3 (-1);;
- : int = 4
The practice of applying some of the arguments of a curried function to get a new
function is called partial application.
Note that the fun keyword supports its own syntax for currying, so the following
denition of abs_diff is equivalent to the previous one.

3.2 Recursive Functions
37
# let abs_diff = (fun x y -> abs (x - y));;
val abs_diff : int -> int -> int = <fun>
You might worry that curried functions are terribly expensive, but this is not the case.
In OCaml, there is no penalty for calling a curried function with all of its arguments.
(Partial application, unsurprisingly, does have a small extra cost.)
Currying is not the only way of writing a multiargument function in OCaml. It's
also possible to use the dierent parts of a tuple as dierent arguments. So, we could
write.
# let abs_diff (x,y) = abs (x - y);;
val abs_diff : int * int -> int = <fun>
# abs_diff (3,4);;
- : int = 1
OCaml handles this calling convention eciently as well. In particular it does not
generally have to allocate a tuple just for the purpose of sending arguments to a tuple-
style function. You can't, however, use partial application for this style of function.
There are small trade-os between these two approaches, but most of the time, one
should stick to currying, since it's the default style in the OCaml world.
3.2.3
Recursive Functions
A function is recursive if it refers to itself in its denition. Recursion is important
in any programming language, but is particularly important in functional languages,
because it is the way that you build looping constructs. (As will be discussed in
more detail in Chapter 9 (Imperative Programming), OCaml also supports imperative
looping constructs like for and while, but these are only useful when using OCaml's
imperative features.)
In order to dene a recursive function, you need to mark the let binding as recursive
with the rec keyword, as shown in this function for nding the rst sequentially repeated
element in a list.
# let rec find_first_repeat list =
match list with
| [] | [_] ->
(* only zero or one elements, so no repeats *)
None
| x :: y :: tl ->
if x = y then Some x else find_first_repeat (y::tl);;
val find_first_repeat : int list -> int option = <fun>
The pattern [] | [_] is itself a disjunction of multiple patterns, otherwise known
as an or-pattern. An or-pattern matches if any of the sub-patterns match. In this case,
[] matches the empty list, and [_] matches any single element list. The _ is there so
we don't have to put an explicit name on that single element.
We can also dene multiple mutually recursive values by using let rec combined
with the and keyword. Here's a (gratuitously inecient) example.
# let rec is_even x =

38
Variables and Functions
if x = 0 then true else is_odd (x - 1)
and is_odd x =
if x = 0 then false else is_even (x - 1);;
val is_even : int -> bool = <fun>
val is_odd : int -> bool = <fun>
# List.map ~f:is_even [0;1;2;3;4;5];;
- : bool list = [true; false; true; false; true; false]
# List.map ~f:is_odd [0;1;2;3;4;5];;
- : bool list = [false; true; false; true; false; true]
OCaml distinguishes between nonrecursive denitions (using let) and recursive
denitions (using let rec) largely for technical reasons: the type-inference algorithm
needs to know when a set of function denitions are mutually recursive, and these have
to be marked explicitly by the programmer.
But this decision has some good eects. For one thing, recursive (and especially
mutually recursive) denitions are harder to reason about than nonrecursive ones. It's
therefore useful that, in the absence of an explicit rec, you can assume that a let
binding is nonrecursive, and so can only build upon previous denitions.
In addition, having a nonrecursive form makes it easier to create a new denition
that extends and supersedes an existing one by shadowing it.
3.2.4
Prex and Inx Operators
So far, we've seen examples of functions used in both prex and inx style.
# Int.max 3 4
(* prefix *);;
- : int = 4
# 3 + 4
(* infix
*);;
- : int = 7
You might not have thought of the second example as an ordinary function, but it
very much is. Inx operators like + really only dier syntactically from other functions.
In fact, if we put parentheses around an inx operator, you can use it as an ordinary
prex function.
# (+) 3 4;;
- : int = 7
# List.map ~f:((+) 3) [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [7; 8; 9]
In the second expression, we've partially applied (+) to create a function that increments
its single argument by 3.
A function is treated syntactically as an operator if the name of that function is
chosen from one of a specialized set of identiers. This set includes identiers that are
sequences of characters from the following set:
~ ! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @ ^ |
as long as the rst character is not ~, !, or $.
There are also a handful of predetermined strings that count as inx operators,
including mod, the modulus operator, and lsl, for logical shift left, a bit-shifting
operation.

3.2 Prex and Inx Operators
39
We can dene (or redene) the meaning of an operator. Here's an example of a
simple vector-addition operator on int pairs.
# let (+!) (x1,y1) (x2,y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2);;
val ( +! ) : int * int -> int * int -> int * int = <fun>
# (3,2) +! (-2,4);;
- : int * int = (1, 6)
You have to be careful when dealing with operators containing *. Consider the following
example.
# let (***) x y = (x **. y) **. y;;
Line 1, characters 18-19:
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of
type
float
What's going on is that (***) isn't interpreted as an operator at all; it's read as a
comment! To get this to work properly, we need to put spaces around any operator that
begins or ends with *.
# let ( *** ) x y = (x **. y) **. y;;
val ( *** ) : float -> float -> float = <fun>
The syntactic role of an operator is typically determined by its rst character or two,
though there are a few exceptions. The OCaml manual has an explicit table of each
class of operator1 and its associated precedence.
We won't go through the full list here, but there's one important special case worth
mentioning: - and -., which are the integer and oating-point subtraction operators,
and can act as both prex operators (for negation) and inx operators (for subtraction).
So, both -x and x - y are meaningful expressions. Another thing to remember about
negation is that it has lower precedence than function application, which means that if
you want to pass a negative value, you need to wrap it in parentheses, as you can see
in this code.
# Int.max 3 (-4);;
- : int = 3
# Int.max 3 -4;;
Line 1, characters 1-10:
Warning 5 [ignored-partial-application]: this function application is
partial,
maybe some arguments are missing.
Line 1, characters 1-10:
Error: This expression has type int -> int
but an expression was expected of type int
Here, OCaml is interpreting the second expression as equivalent to.
# (Int.max 3) - 4;;
Line 1, characters 1-12:
Warning 5 [ignored-partial-application]: this function application is
partial,
maybe some arguments are missing.

Variables and Functions
Line 1, characters 1-12:
Error: This expression has type int -> int
but an expression was expected of type int
which obviously doesn't make sense.
Here's an example of a very useful operator from the standard library whose behavior
depends critically on the precedence rules described previously.
# let (|>) x f = f x;;
val ( |> ) : 'a -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b = <fun>
This is called the reverse application operator, and it's not quite obvious at rst
what its purpose is: it just takes a value and a function and applies the function to the
value. Despite that bland-sounding description, it has the useful role of sequencing
operations, similar in spirit to using the pipe character in the UNIX shell. Consider, for
example, the following code for printing out the unique elements of your PATH.
# open Stdio;;
# let path = "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin";;
val path : string = "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin"
# String.split ~on:':' path
|> List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare
|> List.iter ~f:print_endline;;
/bin
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
- : unit = ()
We can do this without |> by naming the intermediate values, but the result is a bit
more verbose.
# let split_path = String.split ~on:':' path in
let deduped_path = List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare
split_path in
List.iter ~f:print_endline deduped_path;;
/bin
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
- : unit = ()
An important part of what's happening here is partial application. For example,
List.iter takes two arguments: a function to be called on each element of the list, and
the list to iterate over. We can call List.iter with all its arguments:
# List.iter ~f:print_endline ["Two"; "lines"];;
Two
lines
- : unit = ()
or, we can pass it just the function argument, leaving us with a function for printing
out a list of strings.
# List.iter ~f:print_endline;;
- : string list -> unit = <fun>

3.2 Declaring Functions with function
41
It is this later form that we're using in the preceding |> pipeline.
But |> only works in the intended way because it is left-associative. Let's see what
happens if we try using a right-associative operator, like (>).
# let (^>) x f = f x;;
val ( ^> ) : 'a -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b = <fun>
# String.split ~on:':' path
^> List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare
^> List.iter ~f:print_endline;;
Line 3, characters 6-32:
Error: This expression has type string list -> unit
but an expression was expected of type
(string list -> string list) -> 'a
Type string list is not compatible with type
string list -> string list
The type error is a little bewildering at rst glance. What's going on
is that, because ^> is right associative, the operator is trying to feed the
value List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare to the function List.iter
~f:print_endline. But List.iter ~f:print_endline expects a list of strings as its
input, not a function.
The type error aside, this example highlights the importance of choosing the operator
you use with care, particularly with respect to associativity.
The Application Operator
|> is known as the reverse application operator. You might be unsurprised to learn
that there's also an application operator:
# (@@);;
- : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b = <fun>
This one is useful for cases where you want to avoid many layers of parentheses
when applying functions to complex expressions. In particular, you can replace f (g
(h x)) with f @@ g @@ h x. Note that, just as we needed |> to be left associative, we
need @@ to be right associative.
3.2.5
Declaring Functions with function
Another way to dene a function is using the function keyword. Instead of having
syntactic support for declaring multiargument (curried) functions, function has built-
in pattern matching. Here's an example.
# let some_or_zero = function
| Some x -> x
| None -> 0;;
val some_or_zero : int option -> int = <fun>
# List.map ~f:some_or_zero [Some 3; None; Some 4];;
- : int list = [3; 0; 4]
This is equivalent to combining an ordinary function denition with a match.
# let some_or_zero num_opt =

42
Variables and Functions
match num_opt with
| Some x -> x
| None -> 0;;
val some_or_zero : int option -> int = <fun>
We can also combine the dierent styles of function declaration together, as in the
following example, where we declare a two-argument (curried) function with a pattern
match on the second argument.
# let some_or_default default = function
| Some x -> x
| None -> default;;
val some_or_default : 'a -> 'a option -> 'a = <fun>
# some_or_default 3 (Some 5);;
- : int = 5
# List.map ~f:(some_or_default 100) [Some 3; None; Some 4];;
- : int list = [3; 100; 4]
Also, note the use of partial application to generate the function passed to List.map.
In other words, some_or_default 100 is a function that was created by feeding just
the rst argument to some_or_default.
3.2.6
Labeled Arguments
Up until now, the functions we've dened have specied their arguments positionally,
i.e., by the order in which the arguments are passed to the function. OCaml also supports
labeled arguments, which let you identify a function argument by name. Indeed, we've
already encountered functions from Base like List.map that use labeled arguments.
Labeled arguments are marked by a leading tilde, and a label (followed by a colon) is
put in front of the variable to be labeled. Here's an example.
# let ratio ~num ~denom = Float.of_int num /. Float.of_int denom;;
val ratio : num:int -> denom:int -> float = <fun>
We can then provide a labeled argument using a similar convention. As you can see,
the arguments can be provided in any order.
# ratio ~num:3 ~denom:10;;
- : float = 0.3
# ratio ~denom:10 ~num:3;;
- : float = 0.3
OCaml also supports label punning, meaning that you get to drop the text after the
colon if the name of the label and the name of the variable being used are the same. We
were actually already using label punning when dening ratio. The following shows
how punning can be used when invoking a function.
# let num = 3 in
let denom = 4 in
ratio ~num ~denom;;
- : float = 0.75

3.2 Flexible Argument Ordering and Partial Application
43
Where Are Labels Useful?
Labeled arguments are a surprisingly useful feature, and it's worth walking through
some of the cases where they come up.
Explicating Long Argument Lists
Beyond a certain number, arguments are easier to remember by name than by position.
Letting the names be used at the call-site (and used in any order) makes client code
easier to read and to write.
Adding Information to Uninformative Argument Types
Consider a function for creating a hash table whose rst argument is the initial size
of the array backing the hash table, and the second is a Boolean ag, which indicates
whether that array will ever shrink when elements are removed.
val create_hashtable : int -> bool -> ('a,'b) Hashtable.t
The signature makes it hard to divine the meaning of those two arguments. but with
labeled arguments, we can make the intent immediately clear.
val create_hashtable :
init_size:int -> allow_shrinking:bool -> ('a,'b) Hashtable.t
Choosing label names well is especially important for Boolean values, since it's
often easy to get confused about whether a value being true is meant to enable or
disable a given feature.
Disambiguating Similar Arguments
This issue comes up most often when a function has multiple arguments of the same
type. Consider this signature for a function that extracts a substring.
val substring: string -> int -> int -> string
Here, the two ints are the starting position and length of the substring to extract,
respectively, but you wouldn't know that from the type signature. We can make the
signature more informative by adding labels.
val substring: string -> pos:int -> len:int -> string
This improves the readability of both the signature and of client code, and makes it
harder to accidentally swap the position and the length.
Flexible Argument Ordering and Partial Application
Consider a function like List.iter which takes two arguments: a function and a list
of elements to call that function on. A common pattern is to partially apply List.iter
by giving it just the function, as in the following example from earlier in the chapter.
# String.split ~on:':' path
|> List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare
|> List.iter ~f:print_endline;;
/bin
/sbin

44
Variables and Functions
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
- : unit = ()
This requires that we put the function argument rst.
Other orderings can be useful either for partial application, or for simple reasons of
readability. For example, when using List.iter with a complex, multi-line iteration
function, it's generally easier to read if the function comes second, after the statement
of what list is being iterated over. On the other hand, when calling List.iter with a
small function, but a large, explicitly written list of values, it's generally easier if the
values come last.
Higher-Order Functions and Labels
One surprising gotcha with labeled arguments is that while order doesn't matter when
calling a function with labeled arguments, it does matter in a higher-order context,
e.g., when passing a function with labeled arguments to another function. Here's an
example.
# let apply_to_tuple f (first,second) = f ~first ~second;;
val apply_to_tuple : (first:'a -> second:'b -> 'c) -> 'a * 'b -> 'c =
<fun>
Here, the denition of apply_to_tuple sets up the expectation that its rst argument
is a function with two labeled arguments, first and second, listed in that order. We
could have dened apply_to_tuple dierently to change the order in which the labeled
arguments were listed.
# let apply_to_tuple_2 f (first,second) = f ~second ~first;;
val apply_to_tuple_2 : (second:'a -> first:'b -> 'c) -> 'b * 'a -> 'c =
<fun>
It turns out this order matters. In particular, if we dene a function that has a dierent
order:
# let divide ~first ~second = first / second;;
val divide : first:int -> second:int -> int = <fun>
we'll nd that it can't be passed in to apply_to_tuple_2.
# apply_to_tuple_2 divide (3,4);;
Line 1, characters 18-24:
Error: This expression has type first:int -> second:int -> int
but an expression was expected of type second:'a -> first:'b ->
'c
But, it works smoothly with the original apply_to_tuple.
# let apply_to_tuple f (first,second) = f ~first ~second;;
val apply_to_tuple : (first:'a -> second:'b -> 'c) -> 'a * 'b -> 'c =
<fun>
# apply_to_tuple divide (3,4);;
- : int = 0
As a result, when passing labeled functions as arguments, you need to take care to
be consistent in your ordering of labeled arguments.

3.2 Explicit Passing of an Optional Argument
45
3.2.7
Optional Arguments
An optional argument is like a labeled argument that the caller can choose whether
or not to provide. Optional arguments are passed in using the same syntax as labeled
arguments, and, like labeled arguments, can be provided in any order.
Here's an example of a string concatenation function with an optional separator.
This function uses the ^ operator for pairwise string concatenation.
# let concat ?sep x y =
let sep = match sep with None -> "" | Some s -> s in
x ^ sep ^ y;;
val concat : ?sep:string -> string -> string -> string = <fun>
# concat "foo" "bar"
(* without the optional argument *);;
- : string = "foobar"
# concat ~sep:":" "foo" "bar"
(* with the optional argument
*);;
- : string = "foo:bar"
Here, ? is used in the denition of the function to mark sep as optional. And while
the caller can pass a value of type string for sep, internally to the function, sep is seen
as a string option, with None appearing when sep is not provided by the caller.
The preceding example needed a bit of boilerplate to choose a default separator
when none was provided. This is a common enough pattern that there's an explicit
syntax for providing a default value, which allows us to write concat more concisely.
# let concat ?(sep="") x y = x ^ sep ^ y;;
val concat : ?sep:string -> string -> string -> string = <fun>
Optional arguments are very useful, but they're also easy to abuse. The key advantage
of optional arguments is that they let you write functions with multiple arguments that
users can ignore most of the time, only worrying about them when they specically want
to invoke those options. They also allow you to extend an API with new functionality
without changing existing code.
The downside is that the caller may be unaware that there is a choice to be made,
and so may unknowingly (and wrongly) pick the default behavior. Optional arguments
really only make sense when the extra concision of omitting the argument outweighs
the corresponding loss of explicitness.
This means that rarely used functions should not have optional arguments. A good
rule of thumb is to avoid optional arguments for functions internal to a module, i.e.,
functions that are not included in the module's interface, or mli le. We'll learn more
about mlis in Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and Programs).
Explicit Passing of an Optional Argument
Under the covers, a function with an optional argument receives None when the caller
doesn't provide the argument, and Some when it does. But the Some and None are
normally not explicitly passed in by the caller.
But sometimes, passing in Some or None explicitly is exactly what you want. OCaml
lets you do this by using ? instead of ~ to mark the argument. Thus, the following two
lines are equivalent ways of specifying the sep argument to concat:

46
Variables and Functions
# concat ~sep:":" "foo" "bar" (* provide the optional argument *);;
- : string = "foo:bar"
# concat ?sep:(Some ":") "foo" "bar" (* pass an explicit [Some] *);;
- : string = "foo:bar"
and the following two lines are equivalent ways of calling concat without specifying
sep.
# concat "foo" "bar" (* don't provide the optional argument *);;
- : string = "foobar"
# concat ?sep:None "foo" "bar" (* explicitly pass `None` *);;
- : string = "foobar"
One use case for this is when you want to dene a wrapper function that mimics the
optional arguments of the function it's wrapping. For example, imagine we wanted to
create a function called uppercase_concat, which is the same as concat except that
it converts the rst string that it's passed to uppercase. We could write the function as
follows.
# let uppercase_concat ?(sep="") a b = concat ~sep (String.uppercase
a) b;;
val uppercase_concat : ?sep:string -> string -> string -> string =
<fun>
# uppercase_concat "foo" "bar";;
- : string = "FOObar"
# uppercase_concat "foo" "bar" ~sep:":";;
- : string = "FOO:bar"
In the way we've written it, we've been forced to separately make the decision as to
what the default separator is. Thus, if we later change concat's default behavior, we'll
need to remember to change uppercase_concat to match it.
Instead, we can have uppercase_concat simply pass through the optional argument
to concat using the ? syntax.
# let uppercase_concat ?sep a b = concat ?sep (String.uppercase a) b;;
val uppercase_concat : ?sep:string -> string -> string -> string =
<fun>
Now, if someone calls uppercase_concat without an argument, an explicit None will
be passed to concat, leaving concat to decide what the default behavior should be.
Inference of Labeled and Optional Arguments
One subtle aspect of labeled and optional arguments is how they are inferred by the
type system. Consider the following example for computing numerical derivatives of a
function of two real variables. The function takes an argument delta, which determines
the scale at which to compute the derivative; values x and y, which determine at which
point to compute the derivative; and the function f, whose derivative is being computed.
The function f itself takes two labeled arguments, x and y. Note that you can use an
apostrophe as part of a variable name, so x' and y' are just ordinary variables.
# let numeric_deriv ~delta ~x ~y ~f =
let x' = x +. delta in
let y' = y +. delta in

3.2 Inference of Labeled and Optional Arguments
47
let base = f ~x ~y in
let dx = (f ~x:x' ~y -. base) /. delta in
let dy = (f ~x ~y:y' -. base) /. delta in
(dx,dy);;
val numeric_deriv :
delta:float ->
x:float -> y:float -> f:(x:float -> y:float -> float) -> float *
float =
<fun>
In principle, it's not obvious how the order of the arguments to f should be chosen.
Since labeled arguments can be passed in arbitrary order, it seems like it could as well
be y:float -> x:float -> float as it is x:float -> y:float -> float.
Even worse, it would be perfectly consistent for f to take an optional argument
instead of a labeled one, which could lead to this type signature for numeric_deriv.
val numeric_deriv :
delta:float ->
x:float -> y:float -> f:(?x:float -> y:float -> float) -> float *
float
Since there are multiple plausible types to choose from, OCaml needs some heuristic
for choosing between them. The heuristic the compiler uses is to prefer labels to options
and to choose the order of arguments that shows up in the source code.
Note that these heuristics might at dierent points in the source suggest dierent
types. Here's a version of numeric_deriv where dierent invocations of f list the
arguments in dierent orders.
# let numeric_deriv ~delta ~x ~y ~f =
let x' = x +. delta in
let y' = y +. delta in
let base = f ~x ~y in
let dx = (f ~y ~x:x' -. base) /. delta in
let dy = (f ~x ~y:y' -. base) /. delta in
(dx,dy);;
Line 5, characters 15-16:
Error: This function is applied to arguments
in an order different from other calls.
This is only allowed when the real type is known.
As suggested by the error message, we can get OCaml to accept the fact that f is
used with dierent argument orders if we provide explicit type information. Thus, the
following code compiles without error, due to the type annotation on f.
# let numeric_deriv ~delta ~x ~y ~(f: x:float -> y:float -> float) =
let x' = x +. delta in
let y' = y +. delta in
let base = f ~x ~y in
let dx = (f ~y ~x:x' -. base) /. delta in
let dy = (f ~x ~y:y' -. base) /. delta in
(dx,dy);;
val numeric_deriv :
delta:float ->
x:float -> y:float -> f:(x:float -> y:float -> float) -> float *
float =
<fun>

48
Variables and Functions
Optional Arguments and Partial Application
Optional arguments can be tricky to think about in the presence of partial application.
We can of course partially apply the optional argument itself.
# let colon_concat = concat ~sep:":";;
val colon_concat : string -> string -> string = <fun>
# colon_concat "a" "b";;
- : string = "a:b"
But what happens if we partially apply just the rst argument?
# let prepend_pound = concat "# ";;
val prepend_pound : string -> string = <fun>
# prepend_pound "a BASH comment";;
- : string = "# a BASH comment"
The optional argument ?sep has now disappeared, or been erased. Indeed, if we try to
pass in that optional argument now, it will be rejected.
# prepend_pound "a BASH comment" ~sep:":";;
Line 1, characters 1-14:
Error: This function has type Base.String.t -> Base.String.t
It is applied to too many arguments; maybe you forgot a `;'.
So when does OCaml decide to erase an optional argument?
The rule is: an optional argument is erased as soon as the rst positional (i.e., neither
labeled nor optional) argument dened after the optional argument is passed in. That
explains the behavior of prepend_pound. But if we had instead dened concat with
the optional argument in the second position:
# let concat x ?(sep="") y = x ^ sep ^ y;;
val concat : string -> ?sep:string -> string -> string = <fun>
then application of the rst argument would not cause the optional argument to be
erased.
# let prepend_pound = concat "# ";;
val prepend_pound : ?sep:string -> string -> string = <fun>
# prepend_pound "a BASH comment";;
- : string = "# a BASH comment"
# prepend_pound "a BASH comment" ~sep:"--- ";;
- : string = "# --- a BASH comment"
However, if all arguments to a function are presented at once, then erasure of optional
arguments isn't applied until all of the arguments are passed in. This preserves our
ability to pass in optional arguments anywhere on the argument list. Thus, we can
write.
# concat "a" "b" ~sep:"=";;
- : string = "a=b"
An optional argument that doesn't have any following positional arguments can't be
erased at all, which leads to a compiler warning.
# let concat x y ?(sep="") = x ^ sep ^ y;;
Line 1, characters 18-24:

3.2 Optional Arguments and Partial Application
49
Warning 16 [unerasable-optional-argument]: this optional argument
cannot be erased.
val concat : string -> string -> ?sep:string -> string = <fun>
And indeed, when we provide the two positional arguments, the sep argument is not
erased, instead returning a function that expects the sep argument to be provided.
# concat "a" "b";;
- : ?sep:string -> string = <fun>
As you can see, OCaml's support for labeled and optional arguments is not without
its complexities. But don't let these complexities obscure the usefulness of these
features. Labels and optional arguments are very eective tools for making your APIs
both more convenient and safer, and it's worth the eort of learning how to use them
eectively.

Lists and Patterns
This chapter will focus on two common elements of programming in OCaml: lists and
pattern matching. Both of these were discussed in Chapter 2 (A Guided Tour), but
we'll go into more depth here, presenting the two topics together and using one to help
illustrate the other.
4.1
List Basics
An OCaml list is an immutable, nite sequence of elements of the same type. As we've
seen, OCaml lists can be generated using a bracket-and-semicolon notation:
# open Base;;
# [1;2;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
And they can also be generated using the equivalent :: notation:
# 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: []));;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
As you can see, the :: operator is right-associative, which means that we can build
up lists without parentheses. The empty list [] is used to terminate a list. Note that the
empty list is polymorphic, meaning it can be used with elements of any type, as you
can see here:
# let empty = [];;
val empty : 'a list = []
# 3 :: empty;;
- : int list = [3]
# "three" :: empty;;
- : string list = ["three"]
The way in which the :: operator attaches elements to the front of a list reects
the fact that OCaml's lists are in fact singly linked lists. The gure below is a rough
graphical representation of how the list 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [] is laid out as a data
structure. The nal arrow (from the box containing 3) points to the empty list.

4.2 Using Patterns to Extract Data from a List
51
Each :: essentially adds a new block to the preceding picture. Such a block contains
two things: a reference to the data in that list element, and a reference to the remainder
of the list. This is why :: can extend a list without modifying it; extension allocates a
new list element but does not change any of the existing ones, as you can see:
# let l = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
val l : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# let m = 0 :: l;;
val m : int list = [0; 1; 2; 3]
# l;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
4.2
Using Patterns to Extract Data from a List
We can read data out of a list using a match expression. Here's a simple example of a
recursive function that computes the sum of all elements of a list:
# let rec sum l =
match l with
| [] -> 0
| hd :: tl -> hd + sum tl;;
val sum : int list -> int = <fun>
# sum [1;2;3];;
- : int = 6
# sum [];;
- : int = 0
This code follows the convention of using hd to represent the rst element (or head) of
the list, and tl to represent the remainder (or tail).
The match expression in sum is really doing two things: rst, it's acting as a case-
analysis tool, breaking down the possibilities into a pattern-indexed list of cases. Sec-
ond, it lets you name substructures within the data structure being matched. In this case,
the variables hd and tl are bound by the pattern that denes the second case of the
match expression. Variables that are bound in this way can be used in the expression
to the right of the arrow for the pattern in question.
The fact that match expressions can be used to bind new variables can be a source
of confusion. To see how, imagine we wanted to write a function that ltered out from
a list all elements equal to a particular value. You might be tempted to write that code
as follows, but when you do, the compiler will immediately warn you that something
is wrong:
# let rec drop_value l to_drop =
match l with
| [] -> []

Lists and Patterns
Line 5, characters 7-15:
Warning 11 [redundant-case]: this match case is unused.
val drop_value : 'a list -> 'a -> 'a list = <fun>
Moreover, the function clearly does the wrong thing, ltering out all elements of the
list rather than just those equal to the provided value, as you can see here:
# drop_value [1;2;3] 2;;
- : int list = []
So, what's going on?
The key observation is that the appearance of to_drop in the second case doesn't
imply a check that the rst element is equal to the value to_drop that was passed in
as an argument to drop_value. Instead, it just causes a new variable to_drop to be
bound to whatever happens to be in the rst element of the list, shadowing the earlier
denition of to_drop. The third case is unused because it is essentially the same pattern
as we had in the second case.
A better way to write this code is not to use pattern matching for determining whether
the rst element is equal to to_drop, but to instead use an ordinary if expression:
# let rec drop_value l to_drop =
match l with
| [] -> []
| hd :: tl ->
let new_tl = drop_value tl to_drop in
if hd = to_drop then new_tl else hd :: new_tl;;
val drop_value : int list -> int -> int list = <fun>
# drop_value [1;2;3] 2;;
- : int list = [1; 3]
If we wanted to drop a particular literal value, rather than a value that was passed
in, we could do this using something like our original implementation of drop_value:
# let rec drop_zero l =
match l with
| [] -> []
| 0
:: tl -> drop_zero tl
| hd :: tl -> hd :: drop_zero tl;;
val drop_zero : int list -> int list = <fun>
# drop_zero [1;2;0;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
4.3
Limitations (and Blessings) of Pattern Matching
The preceding example highlights an important fact about patterns, which is that they
can't be used to express arbitrary conditions. Patterns can characterize the layout of
a data structure and can even include literals, as in the drop_zero example, but that's
where they stop. A pattern can check if a list has two elements, but it can't check if the
rst two elements are equal to each other.
You can think of patterns as a specialized sublanguage that can express a limited
(though still quite rich) set of conditions. The fact that the pattern language is limited

4.3 Performance
53
turns out to be a good thing, making it possible to build better support for patterns in
the compiler. In particular, both the eciency of match expressions and the ability of
the compiler to detect errors in matches depend on the constrained nature of patterns.
4.3.1
Performance
Naively, you might think that it would be necessary to check each case in a match in
sequence to gure out which one res. If the cases of a match were guarded by arbitrary
code, that would be the case. But OCaml is often able to generate machine code that
jumps directly to the matched case based on an eciently chosen set of runtime checks.
As an example, consider the following rather silly functions for incrementing an
integer by one. The rst is implemented with a match expression, and the second with
a sequence of if expressions:
# let plus_one_match x =
match x with
| 0 -> 1
| 1 -> 2
| 2 -> 3
| 3 -> 4
| 4 -> 5
| 5 -> 6
| _ -> x + 1;;
val plus_one_match : int -> int = <fun>
# let plus_one_if x =
if
x = 0 then 1
else if x = 1 then 2
else if x = 2 then 3
else if x = 3 then 4
else if x = 4 then 5
else if x = 5 then 6
else x + 1;;
val plus_one_if : int -> int = <fun>
Note the use of _ in the above match. This is a wildcard pattern that matches any
value, but without binding a variable name to the value in question.
If you benchmark these functions, you'll see that plus_one_if is considerably slower
than plus_one_match, and the advantage gets larger as the number of cases increases.
Here, we'll benchmark these functions using the core_bench library, which can be
installed by running opam install core_bench from the command line.
# #require "core_bench";;
# open Core_bench;;
# [ Bench.Test.create ~name:"plus_one_match" (fun () ->
plus_one_match 10)
; Bench.Test.create ~name:"plus_one_if" (fun () ->
plus_one_if 10) ]

Here's another, less articial example. We can rewrite the sum function we described
earlier in the chapter using an if expression rather than a match. We can then use the
functions is_empty, hd_exn, and tl_exn from the List module to deconstruct the list,
allowing us to implement the entire function without pattern matching:
# let rec sum_if l =
if List.is_empty l then 0
else List.hd_exn l + sum_if (List.tl_exn l);;
val sum_if : int list -> int = <fun>
Again, we can benchmark these to see the dierence:
# let numbers = List.range 0 1000 in
[ Bench.Test.create ~name:"sum_if" (fun () -> sum_if numbers)
; Bench.Test.create ~name:"sum"
(fun () -> sum numbers) ]

In this case, the match-based implementation is many times faster than the if-based
implementation. The dierence comes because we need to eectively do the same
work multiple times, since each function we call has to reexamine the rst element of
the list to determine whether or not it's the empty cell. With a match expression, this
work happens exactly once per list element.
This is a more general phenomenon: pattern matching is very ecient, and is usually
faster than what you might write yourself.
4.3.2
Detecting Errors
The error-detecting capabilities of match expressions are if anything more important
than their performance. We've already seen one example of OCaml's ability to nd
problems in a pattern match: in our broken implementation of drop_value, OCaml
warned us that the nal case was redundant. There are no algorithms for determining
if a predicate written in a general-purpose language is redundant, but it can be solved
reliably in the context of patterns.
OCaml also checks match expressions for exhaustiveness. Consider what happens
if we modify drop_zero by deleting the handler for one of the cases. As you can see,
the compiler will produce a warning that we've missed a case, along with an example
of an unmatched pattern:

4.4 Using the List Module Eectively
55
# let rec drop_zero l =
match l with
| [] -> []
| 0
:: tl -> drop_zero tl;;
Lines 2-4, characters 5-31:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
1::_
val drop_zero : int list -> 'a list = <fun>
Even for simple examples like this, exhaustiveness checks are pretty useful. But
as we'll see in Chapter 7 (Variants), they become yet more valuable as you get to
more complicated examples, especially those involving user-dened types. In addition
to catching outright errors, they act as a sort of refactoring tool, guiding you to the
locations where you need to adapt your code to deal with changing types.
4.4
Using the List Module Eectively
We've so far written a fair amount of list-munging code using pattern matching and
recursive functions. In real life, you're usually better o using the List module, which
is full of reusable functions that abstract out common patterns for computing with lists.
Let's work through a concrete example. We'll write a function render_table that,
given a list of column headers and a list of rows, prints them out in a well-formatted
text table. When we're done, here's how the resulting function should work:
# Stdio.print_endline
(render_table
["language";"architect";"first release"]
[ ["Lisp" ;"John McCarthy" ;"1958"] ;
["C"
;"Dennis Ritchie";"1969"] ;

- : unit = ()
The rst step is to write a function to compute the maximum width of each column
of data. We can do this by converting the header and each row into a list of integer
lengths, and then taking the element-wise max of those lists of lengths. Writing the
code for all of this directly would be a bit of a chore, but we can do it quite concisely
by making use of three functions from the List module: map, map2_exn, and fold.
List.map is the simplest to explain. It takes a list and a function for transforming
elements of that list, and returns a new list with the transformed elements. Thus, we
can write:
# List.map ~f:String.length ["Hello"; "World!"];;

56
Lists and Patterns
- : int list = [5; 6]
List.map2_exn is similar to List.map, except that it takes two lists and a function
for combining them. Thus, we might write:
# List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max [1;2;3] [3;2;1];;
- : int list = [3; 2; 3]
The _exn is there because the function throws an exception if the lists are of mismatched
length:
# List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max [1;2;3] [3;2;1;0];;
Exception: (Invalid_argument "length mismatch in map2_exn: 3 <> 4")
List.fold is the most complicated of the three, taking three arguments: a list to
process, an initial accumulator value, and a function for updating the accumulator.
List.fold walks over the list from left to right, updating the accumulator at each step
and returning the nal value of the accumulator when it's done. You can see some of
this by looking at the type-signature for fold:
# List.fold;;
- : 'a list -> init:'accum -> f:('accum -> 'a -> 'accum) -> 'accum = <fun>
We can use List.fold for something as simple as summing up a list:
# List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) [1;2;3;4];;
- : int = 10
This example is particularly simple because the accumulator and the list elements are
of the same type. But fold is not limited to such cases. We can for example use fold
to reverse a list, in which case the accumulator is itself a list:
# List.fold ~init:[] ~f:(fun acc hd -> hd :: acc) [1;2;3;4];;
- : int list = [4; 3; 2; 1]
Let's bring our three functions together to compute the maximum column widths:
# let max_widths header rows =
let lengths l = List.map ~f:String.length l in
List.fold rows
~init:(lengths header)
~f:(fun acc row ->
List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max acc (lengths row));;
val max_widths : string list -> string list list -> int list = <fun>
Using List.map we dene the function lengths, which converts a list of strings to a
list of integer lengths. List.fold is then used to iterate over the rows, using map2_exn
to take the max of the accumulator with the lengths of the strings in each row of the
table, with the accumulator initialized to the lengths of the header row.
Now that we know how to compute column widths, we can write the code to generate
the line that separates the header from the rest of the text table. We'll do this in part by
mapping String.make over the lengths of the columns to generate a string of dashes
of the appropriate length. We'll then join these sequences of dashes together using
String.concat, which concatenates a list of strings with an optional separator string,
and ^, which is a pairwise string concatenation function, to add the delimiters on the
outside:

4.4 Using the List Module Eectively
57
# let render_separator widths =
let pieces = List.map widths
~f:(fun w -> String.make w '-')
in
"|-" ^ String.concat ~sep:"-+-" pieces ^ "-|";;
val render_separator : int list -> string = <fun>
# render_separator [3;6;2];;
- : string = "|-----+--------+----|"
Note that we make the line of dashes two larger than the provided width to provide
some whitespace around each entry in the table.
Performance of String.concat and ˆ
In the preceding code we've concatenated strings two dierent ways: String.concat,
which operates on lists of strings; and ^, which is a pairwise operator. You should avoid
^ for joining large numbers of strings, since it allocates a new string every time it runs.
Thus, the following code
# let s = "." ^ "."
^ "."
^ "."
^ "."
^ "."
^ ".";;
val s : string = "......."
will allocate strings of length 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, whereas this code
# let s = String.concat [".";".";".";".";".";".";"."];;
val s : string = "......."
allocates one string of size 7, as well as a list of length 7. At these small sizes, the
dierences don't amount to much, but for assembling large strings, it can be a serious
performance issue.
Now we need code for rendering a row with data in it. We'll rst write a function
called pad, for padding out a string to a specied length:
# let pad s length =
s ^ String.make (length - String.length s) ' ';;
val pad : string -> int -> string = <fun>
# pad "hello" 10;;
- : string = "hello
"
We can render a row of data by merging together the padded strings. Again, we'll
use List.map2_exn for combining the list of data in the row with the list of widths:
# let render_row row widths =
let padded = List.map2_exn row widths ~f:pad in
"| " ^ String.concat ~sep:" | " padded ^ " |";;
val render_row : string list -> int list -> string = <fun>
# render_row ["Hello";"World"] [10;15];;
- : string = "| Hello
| World
|"
Finally, we can bring this all together to build the render_table function we wanted
at the start!
# let render_table header rows =
let widths = max_widths header rows in
String.concat ~sep:"\n"

More Useful List Functions
The previous example touched on only three of the functions in List. We won't cover
the entire interface (for that you should look at the online docs1), but a few more
functions are useful enough to mention here.
Combining List Elements with List.reduce
List.fold, which we described earlier, is a very general and powerful function. Some-
times, however, you want something simpler and easier to use. One such function
is List.reduce, which is essentially a specialized version of List.fold that doesn't
require an explicit starting value, and whose accumulator has to consume and produce
values of the same type as the elements of the list it applies to.
Here's the type signature:
# List.reduce;;
- : 'a list -> f:('a -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a option = <fun>
reduce returns an optional result, returning None when the input list is empty.
Now we can see reduce in action:
# List.reduce ~f:(+) [1;2;3;4;5];;
- : int option = Some 15
# List.reduce ~f:(+) [];;
- : int option = None
Filtering with List.filter and List.filter_map
Very often when processing lists, you want to restrict your attention to a subset of the
values on your list. The List.filter function is one way of doing that:
# List.filter ~f:(fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [1;2;3;4;5];;
- : int list = [2; 4]
Sometimes, you want to both transform and lter as part of the same computation. In
that case, List.filter_map is what you need. The function passed to List.filter_map
returns an optional value, and List.filter_map drops all elements for which None is
returned.
Here's an example. The following function computes a list of le extensions from
a list of les, piping the results through List.dedup_and_sort to return the list with
duplicates removed and in sorted order. Note that this example uses String.rsplit2
from the String module to split a string on the rightmost appearance of a given character:
1 https://v3.ocaml.org/p/base/v0.14.3/doc/Base/List/index.html

4.4 Combining lists
59
# let extensions filenames =
List.filter_map filenames ~f:(fun fname ->
match String.rsplit2 ~on:'.' fname with
| None
| Some ("",_) -> None
| Some (_,ext) ->
Some ext)
|> List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare;;
val extensions : string list -> string list = <fun>
# extensions ["foo.c"; "foo.ml"; "bar.ml"; "bar.mli"];;
- : string list = ["c"; "ml"; "mli"]
The preceding code is also an example of an or-pattern, which allows you to have
multiple subpatterns within a larger pattern. In this case, None | Some ("",_) is an
or-pattern. As we'll see later, or-patterns can be nested anywhere within larger patterns.
Partitioning with List.partition_tf
Another useful operation that's closely related to ltering is partitioning. The function
List.partition_tf takes a list and a function for computing a Boolean condition on
the list elements, and returns two lists. The tf in the name is a mnemonic to remind
the user that true elements go to the rst list and false ones go to the second. Here's
an example:
# let is_ocaml_source s =
match String.rsplit2 s ~on:'.' with
| Some (_,("ml"|"mli")) -> true
| _ -> false;;
val is_ocaml_source : string -> bool = <fun>
# let (ml_files,other_files) =
List.partition_tf ["foo.c"; "foo.ml"; "bar.ml"; "bar.mli"]
~f:is_ocaml_source;;
val ml_files : string list = ["foo.ml"; "bar.ml"; "bar.mli"]
val other_files : string list = ["foo.c"]
Combining lists
Another very common operation on lists is concatenation. The List module actually
comes with a few dierent ways of doing this. There's List.append, for concatenating
a pair of lists.
# List.append [1;2;3] [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
There's also @, an operator equivalent of List.append.
# [1;2;3] @ [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
In addition, there is List.concat, for concatenating a list of lists:
# List.concat [[1;2];[3;4;5];[6];[]];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
Here's an example of using List.concat along with List.map to compute a recursive
listing of a directory tree.

Lists and Patterns
# module Sys = Core.Sys
module Filename = Core.Filename;;
module Sys = Core.Sys
module Filename = Core.Filename
# let rec ls_rec s =

then [s]
else
Sys.ls_dir s
|> List.map ~f:(fun sub -> ls_rec (Filename.concat s sub))
|> List.concat;;
val ls_rec : string -> string list = <fun>
Note that this example uses some functions from the Sys and Filename modules from
Core for accessing the lesystem and dealing with lenames.
The preceding combination of List.map and List.concat is common enough that
there is a function List.concat_map that combines these into one, more ecient
operation:
# let rec ls_rec s =
if Sys.is_file_exn ~follow_symlinks:true s
then [s]
else
Sys.ls_dir s
|> List.concat_map ~f:(fun sub -> ls_rec (Filename.concat s
sub));;
val ls_rec : string -> string list = <fun>
4.5
Tail Recursion
The only way to compute the length of an OCaml list is to walk the list from beginning
to end. As a result, computing the length of a list takes time linear in the size of the
list. Here's a simple function for doing so:
# let rec length = function
| [] -> 0
| _ :: tl -> 1 + length tl;;
val length : 'a list -> int = <fun>
# length [1;2;3];;
- : int = 3
This looks simple enough, but you'll discover that this implementation runs into
problems on very large lists, as we'll show in the following code:
# let make_list n = List.init n ~f:(fun x -> x);;
val make_list : int -> int list = <fun>
# length (make_list 10);;
- : int = 10
# length (make_list 10_000_000);;
Stack overflow during evaluation (looping recursion?).
The preceding example creates lists using List.init, which takes an integer n and

4.5 Tail Recursion
61
a function f and creates a list of length n, where the data for each element is created
by calling f on the index of that element.
To understand where the error in the above example comes from, you need to learn a
bit more about how function calls work. Typically, a function call needs some space to
keep track of information associated with the call, such as the arguments passed to the
function, or the location of the code that needs to start executing when the function call
is complete. To allow for nested function calls, this information is typically organized
in a stack, where a new stack frame is allocated for each nested function call, and then
deallocated when the function call is complete.
And that's the problem with our call to length: it tried to allocate 10 million stack
frames, which exhausted the available stack space. Happily, there's a way around this
problem. Consider the following alternative implementation:
# let rec length_plus_n l n =
match l with
| [] -> n
| _ :: tl -> length_plus_n tl (n + 1);;
val length_plus_n : 'a list -> int -> int = <fun>
# let length l = length_plus_n l 0;;
val length : 'a list -> int = <fun>
# length [1;2;3;4];;
- : int = 4
This implementation depends on a helper function, length_plus_n, that computes
the length of a given list plus a given n. In practice, n acts as an accumulator in which
the answer is built up, step by step. As a result, we can do the additions along the way
rather than doing them as we unwind the nested sequence of function calls, as we did
in our rst implementation of length.
The advantage of this approach is that the recursive call in length_plus_n is a tail
call. We'll explain more precisely what it means to be a tail call shortly, but the reason
it's important is that tail calls don't require the allocation of a new stack frame, due to
what is called the tail-call optimization. A recursive function is said to be tail recursive
if all of its recursive calls are tail calls. length_plus_n is indeed tail recursive, and as
a result, length can take a long list as input without blowing the stack:
# length (make_list 10_000_000);;
- : int = 10000000
So when is a call a tail call? Let's think about the situation where one function (the
caller) invokes another (the callee). The invocation is considered a tail call when the
caller doesn't do anything with the value returned by the callee except to return it. The
tail-call optimization makes sense because, when a caller makes a tail call, the caller's
stack frame need never be used again, and so you don't need to keep it around. Thus,
instead of allocating a new stack frame for the callee, the compiler is free to reuse the
caller's stack frame.
Tail recursion is important for more than just lists. Ordinary non-tail recursive calls
are reasonable when dealing with data structures like binary trees, where the depth of
the tree is logarithmic in the size of your data. But when dealing with situations where

62
Lists and Patterns
the depth of the sequence of nested calls is on the order of the size of your data, tail
recursion is usually the right approach.
4.6
Terser and Faster Patterns
Now that we know more about how lists and patterns work, let's consider how we
can improve on an example from Chapter 2.3.2 (Recursive List Functions): the func-
tion remove_sequential_duplicates. Here's the implementation that was described
earlier:
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
match list with
| [] -> []
| [x] -> [x]
| first :: second :: tl ->
if first = second then
remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)
else
first :: remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl);;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
We'll consider some ways of making this code more concise and more ecient.
First, let's consider eciency. One problem with the above code is that it in some
cases re-creates on the right-hand side of the arrow a value that already existed on the
left-hand side. Thus, the pattern [hd] -> [hd] actually allocates a new list element,
when really, it should be able to just return the list being matched. We can reduce
allocation here by using an as pattern, which allows us to declare a name for the thing
matched by a pattern or subpattern. While we're at it, we'll use the function keyword
to eliminate the need for an explicit match:
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates = function
| [] as l -> l
| [_] as l -> l
| first :: (second :: _ as tl) ->
if first = second then
remove_sequential_duplicates tl
else
first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
We can further collapse this by combining the rst two cases into one, using an
or-pattern:
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
match list with
| [] | [_] as l -> l
| first :: (second :: _ as tl) ->
if first = second then
remove_sequential_duplicates tl
else
first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>

4.6 Terser and Faster Patterns
63
We can make the code slightly terser now by using a when clause. A when clause
allows us to add an extra precondition to a pattern in the form of an arbitrary OCaml
expression. In this case, we can use it to include the check on whether the rst two
elements are equal:
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
match list with
| [] | [_] as l -> l
| first :: (second :: _ as tl) when first = second ->
remove_sequential_duplicates tl
| first :: tl -> first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
Polymorphic Compare
You might have noticed that remove_sequential_duplicates is specialized to lists of
integers. That's because Base's default equality operator is specialized to integers, as
you can see if you try to apply it to values of a dierent type.
# open Base;;
# "foo" = "bar";;
Line 1, characters 1-6:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
int
OCaml also has a collection of polymorphic equality and comparison operators,
which we can make available by opening the module Base.Poly.
# open Base.Poly;;
# "foo" = "bar";;
- : bool = false
# 3 = 4;;
- : bool = false
# [1;2;3] = [1;2;3];;
- : bool = true
Indeed, if we look at the type of the equality operator, we'll see that it is polymorphic.
# (=);;
- : 'a -> 'a -> bool = <fun>
If we rewrite remove_sequential_duplicates with Base.Poly open, we'll see that
it gets a polymorphic type, and can now be used on inputs of dierent types.
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
match list with
| [] | [_] as l -> l
| first :: (second :: _ as tl) when first = second ->
remove_sequential_duplicates tl
| first :: tl -> first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
# remove_sequential_duplicates [1;2;2;3;4;3;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 3]
# remove_sequential_duplicates ["one";"two";"two";"two";"three"];;
- : string list = ["one"; "two"; "three"]

Lists and Patterns
OCaml comes with a whole family of polymorphic comparison operators, including
the standard inx comparators, <, >=, etc., as well as the function compare that returns
-1, 0, or 1 to ag whether the rst operand is smaller than, equal to, or greater than the
second, respectively.
You might wonder how you could build functions like these yourself if OCaml didn't
come with them built in. It turns out that you can't build these functions on your own.
OCaml's polymorphic comparison functions are built into the runtime to a low level.
These comparisons are polymorphic on the basis of ignoring almost everything about
the types of the values that are being compared, paying attention only to the structure
of the values as they're laid out in memory. (You can learn more about this structure
in Chapter 24 (Memory Representation of Values).)
Polymorphic compare does have some limitations. For example, it will fail at runtime
if it encounters a function value.
# (fun x -> x + 1) = (fun x -> x + 1);;
Exception: (Invalid_argument "compare: functional value")
Similarly, it will fail on values that come from outside the OCaml heap, like values
from C bindings. But it will work in a reasonable way for most other kinds of values.
For simple atomic types, polymorphic compare has the semantics you would expect:
for oating-point numbers and integers, polymorphic compare corresponds to the
expected numerical comparison functions. For strings, it's a lexicographic comparison.
That said, experienced OCaml developers typically avoid polymorphic comparison.
That's surprising, given how obviously useful it is, but there's a good reason. While
it's very convenient, in some cases, the type oblivious nature of polymorphic compare
means that it does something that doesn't make sense for the particular type of values
you're dealing with. This can lead to surprising and hard to resolve bugs in your code.
It's for this reason that Base discourages the use of polymorphic compare by hiding it
by default.
We'll discuss the downsides of polymorphic compare in more detail in Chapter 15
(Maps and Hash Tables).
Note that when clauses have some downsides. As we noted earlier, the static checks
associated with pattern matches rely on the fact that patterns are restricted in what
they can express. Once we add the ability to add an arbitrary condition to a pattern,
something is lost. In particular, the ability of the compiler to determine if a match is
exhaustive, or if some case is redundant, is compromised.
Consider the following function, which takes a list of optional values, and returns the
number of those values that are Some. Because this implementation uses when clauses,
the compiler can't tell that the code is exhaustive:
# let rec count_some list =
match list with
| [] -> 0
| x :: tl when Option.is_none x -> count_some tl
| x :: tl when Option.is_some x -> 1 + count_some tl;;
Lines 2-5, characters 5-57:

4.6 Terser and Faster Patterns
65
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
_::_
(However, some guarded clause may match this value.)
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
Despite the warning, the function does work ne:
# count_some [Some 3; None; Some 4];;
- : int = 2
If we add another redundant case without a when clause, the compiler will stop
complaining about exhaustiveness and won't produce a warning about the redundancy.
# let rec count_some list =
match list with
| [] -> 0
| x :: tl when Option.is_none x -> count_some tl
| x :: tl when Option.is_some x -> 1 + count_some tl
| x :: tl -> -1 (* unreachable *);;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
Probably a better approach is to simply drop the second when clause:
# let rec count_some list =
match list with
| [] -> 0
| x :: tl when Option.is_none x -> count_some tl
| _ :: tl -> 1 + count_some tl;;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
This is a little less clear, however, than the direct pattern-matching solution, where
the meaning of each pattern is clearer on its own:
# let rec count_some list =
match list with
| [] -> 0
| None
:: tl -> count_some tl
| Some _ :: tl -> 1 + count_some tl;;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
The takeaway from all of this is although when clauses can be useful, we should
prefer patterns wherever they are sucient.
As a side note, the above implementation of count_some is longer than necessary;
even worse, it is not tail recursive. In real life, you would probably just use the
List.count function:
# let count_some l = List.count ~f:Option.is_some l;;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>

Files, Modules, and Programs
We've so far experienced OCaml largely through the toplevel. As you move from
exercises to real-world programs, you'll need to leave the toplevel behind and start
building programs from les. Files are more than just a convenient way to store and
manage your code; in OCaml, they also correspond to modules, which act as boundaries
that divide your program into conceptual units.
In this chapter, we'll show you how to build an OCaml program from a collection
of les, as well as the basics of working with modules and module signatures.
5.1
Single-File Programs
We'll start with an example: a utility that reads lines from stdin, computes a frequency
count of the lines, and prints out the ten most frequent lines. We'll start with a simple
implementation, which we'll save as the le freq.ml.
This implementation will use two functions from the List.Assoc module, which
provides utility functions for interacting with association lists, i.e., lists of key/value
pairs. In particular, we use the function List.Assoc.find, which looks up a key in an
association list; and List.Assoc.add, which adds a new binding to an association list,
as shown here:
# open Base;;
# let assoc = [("one", 1); ("two",2); ("three",3)];;
val assoc : (string * int) list = [("one", 1); ("two", 2); ("three",
3)]
# List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal assoc "two";;
- : int option = Some 2
# List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal assoc "four" 4;;
- : (string, int) Base.List.Assoc.t =
[("four", 4); ("one", 1); ("two", 2); ("three", 3)]
# List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal assoc "two"
4;;
- : (string, int) Base.List.Assoc.t = [("two", 4); ("one", 1);
("three", 3)]
Note that List.Assoc.add doesn't modify the original list, but instead allocates a new
list with the requisite key/value pair added.
Now we can write freq.ml.
open Base
open Stdio

5.1 Single-File Programs
67
let build_counts () =
In_channel.fold_lines In_channel.stdin ~init:[] ~f:(fun counts line
->
let count =
match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal counts line with
| None -> 0
| Some x -> x
in
List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal counts line (count + 1))
let () =
build_counts ()
|> List.sort ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) -> Int.descending x y)
|> (fun l -> List.take l 10)
|> List.iter ~f:(fun (line, count) -> printf "%3d: %s\n" count line)
The function build_counts reads in lines from stdin, constructing from those
lines an association list with the frequencies of each line. It does this by invoking
In_channel.fold_lines (similar to the function List.fold described in Chapter 4
(Lists and Patterns)), which reads through the lines one by one, calling the provided
fold function for each line to update the accumulator. That accumulator is initialized
to the empty list.
With build_counts dened, we then call the function to build the association list,
sort that list by frequency in descending order, grab the rst 10 elements o the list,
and then iterate over those 10 elements and print them to the screen. These operations
are tied together using the |> operator described in Chapter 3.2.4 (Prex and Inx
Operators).
Where Is main?
Unlikeprograms in C,Javaor C#,programs in OCamldon'thaveaunique main function.
When an OCaml program is evaluated, all the statements in the implementation les
are evaluated in the order in which they were linked together. These implementation
les can contain arbitrary expressions, not just function denitions. In this example,
the declaration starting with let () = plays the role of the main function, kicking o
the processing. But really the entire le is evaluated at startup, and so in some sense
the full codebase is one big main function.
The idiom of writing let () = may seem a bit odd, but it has a purpose. The let
binding here is a pattern-match to a value of type unit, which is there to ensure that
the expression on the right-hand side returns unit, as is common for functions that
operate primarily by side eect.
If we weren't using Base or any other external libraries, we could build the executable
like this:
$ ocamlopt freq.ml -o freq
File "freq.ml", line 1, characters 5-9:
1 | open Base
^^^^
Error: Unbound module Base

68
Files, Modules, and Programs
[2]
But as you can see, it fails because it can't nd Base and Stdio. We need a somewhat
more complex invocation to get them linked in:
$ ocamlfind ocamlopt -linkpkg -package base -package stdio freq.ml -o
freq
This uses ocamlfind, a tool which itself invokes other parts of the OCaml toolchain
(in this case, ocamlopt) with the appropriate ags to link in particular libraries and pack-
ages. Here, -package base is asking ocamlfind to link in the Base library; -linkpkg
asks ocamlnd to link in the packages as is necessary for building an executable.
While this works well enough for a one-le project, more complicated projects
require a tool to orchestrate the build. One good tool for this task is dune. To invoke
dune, you need to have two les: a dune-project le for the overall project, and a dune
le that congures the particular directory. This is a single-directory project, so we'll
just have one of each, but more realistic projects will have one dune-project and many
dune les.
At its simplest, the dune-project just species the version of the dune conguration-
language in use.
(lang dune 3.0)
We also need a dune le to declare the executable we want to build, along with the
libraries it depends on.
(executable
(name
freq)
(libraries base stdio))
With that in place, we can invoke dune as follows.
$ dune build freq.exe
We can run the resulting executable, freq.exe, from the command line. Executables
built with dune will be left in the _build/default directory, from which they can be
invoked. The specic invocation below will count the words that come up in the le
freq.ml itself.
$ grep -Eo '[[:alpha:]]+' freq.ml | ./_build/default/freq.exe
5: line
5: List
5: counts
4: count
4: fun
4: x
4: equal
3: let
2: f
2: l
Conveniently, dune allows us to combine the building and running an executable
into a single operation, which we can do using dune exec.

5.2 Multile Programs and Modules
69
$ grep -Eo '[[:alpha:]]+' freq.ml | dune exec ./freq.exe
5: line
5: List
5: counts
4: count
4: fun
4: x
4: equal
3: let
2: f
2: l
We've really just scratched the surface of what can be done with dune. We'll discuss
dune in more detail in Chapter 1.1.3 (The OCaml Platform).
Bytecode Versus Native Code
OCaml ships with two compilers: the ocamlopt native code compiler and the ocamlc
bytecode compiler. Programs compiled with ocamlc are interpreted by a virtual ma-
chine, while programs compiled with ocamlopt are compiled to machine code to be run
on a specic operating system and processor architecture. With dune, targets ending
with .bc are built as bytecode executables, and those ending with .exe are built as
native code.
Aside from performance, executables generated by the two compilers have nearly
identical behavior. There are a few things to be aware of. First, the bytecode compiler
can be used on more architectures, and has some tools that are not available for native
code. For example, the OCaml debugger only works with bytecode (although gdb, the
GNU Debugger, works with some limitations on OCaml native-code applications).
The bytecode compiler is also quicker than the native-code compiler. In addition, in
order to run a bytecode executable, you typically need to have OCaml installed on the
system in question. That's not strictly required, though, since you can build a bytecode
executable with an embedded runtime, using the -custom compiler ag.
As a general matter, production executables should usually be built using the native-
code compiler, but it sometimes makes sense to use bytecode for development builds.
And, of course, bytecode makes sense when targeting a platform not supported by the
native-code compiler. We'll cover both compilers in more detail in Chapter 27 (The
Compiler Backend: Bytecode and Native code).
5.2
Multile Programs and Modules
Source les in OCaml are tied into the module system, with each le compiling down
into a module whose name is derived from the name of the le. We've encountered
modules before, such as when we used functions like find and add from the List.Assoc
module. At its simplest, you can think of a module as a collection of denitions that
are stored within a namespace.
Let's consider how we can use modules to refactor the implementation of freq.ml.

70
Files, Modules, and Programs
Remember that the variable counts contains an association list representing the counts
of the lines seen so far. But updating an association list takes time linear in the length
of the list, meaning that the time complexity of processing a le is quadratic in the
number of distinct lines in the le.
We can x this problem by replacing association lists with a more ecient data struc-
ture. To do that, we'll rst factor out the key functionality into a separate module with
an explicit interface. We can consider alternative (and more ecient) implementations
once we have a clear interface to program against.
We'll start by creating a le, counter.ml, that contains the logic for maintaining the
association list used to represent the frequency counts. The key function, called touch,
bumps the frequency count of a given line by one.
open Base
let touch counts line =
let count =
match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal counts line with
| None -> 0
| Some x -> x
in
List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal counts line (count + 1)
The le counter.ml will be compiled into a module named Counter, where the
name of the module is derived automatically from the lename. The module name is
capitalized even if the le is not. Indeed, module names are always capitalized.
We can now rewrite freq.ml to use Counter.
open Base
open Stdio
let build_counts () =
In_channel.fold_lines In_channel.stdin ~init:[] ~f:Counter.touch
let () =
build_counts ()
|> List.sort ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) -> Int.descending x y)
|> (fun l -> List.take l 10)
|> List.iter ~f:(fun (line, count) -> printf "%3d: %s\n" count line)
The resulting code can still be built with dune, which will discover dependencies
and realize that counter.ml needs to be compiled.
$ dune build freq.exe
5.3
Signatures and Abstract Types
While we've pushed some of the logic to the Counter module, the code in freq.ml
can still depend on the details of the implementation of Counter. Indeed, if you look
at the denition of build_counts, you'll see that it depends on the fact that the empty
set of frequency counts is represented as an empty list. We'd like to prevent this kind

5.3 Signatures and Abstract Types
71
of dependency, so we can change the implementation of Counter without needing to
change client code like that in freq.ml.
The implementation details of a module can be hidden by attaching an interface.
(Note that in the context of OCaml, the terms interface, signature, and module type are
all used interchangeably.) A module dened by a le filename.ml can be constrained
by a signature placed in a le called filename.mli.
For counter.mli, we'll start by writing down an interface that describes what's
currently available in counter.ml, without hiding anything. val declarations are used
to specify values in a signature. The syntax of a val declaration is as follows:
val <identifier> : <type>
Using this syntax, we can write the signature of counter.ml as follows.
open Base
(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)
val touch : (string * int) list -> string -> (string * int) list
Note that dune will detect the presence of the mli le automatically and include it
in the build.
To hide the fact that frequency counts are represented as association lists, we'll need
to make the type of frequency counts abstract. A type is abstract if its name is exposed
in the interface, but its denition is not. Here's an abstract interface for Counter:
open Base
(** A collection of string frequency counts *)
type t
(** The empty set of frequency counts *)
val empty : t
(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)
val touch : t -> string -> t
(** Converts the set of frequency counts to an association list. A
string shows up at most once, and the counts are >= 1. *)
val to_list : t -> (string * int) list
We added empty and to_list to Counter, since without them there would be no way
to create a Counter.t or get data out of one.
We also used this opportunity to document the module. The mli le is the place
where you specify your module's interface, and as such is a natural place to put
documentation. We started our comments with a double asterisk to cause them to be
picked up by the odoc tool when generating API documentation. We'll discuss odoc
more in Chapter 22.2.2 (Browsing Interface Documentation).
Here's a rewrite of counter.ml to match the new counter.mli:
open Base
type t = (string * int) list

72
Files, Modules, and Programs
let empty = []
let to_list x = x
let touch counts line =
let count =
match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal counts line with
| None -> 0
| Some x -> x
in
List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal counts line (count + 1)
If we now try to compile freq.ml, we'll get the following error:
$ dune build freq.exe
File "freq.ml", line 5, characters 53-66:
5 |
In_channel.fold_lines In_channel.stdin ~init:[] ~f:Counter.touch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type Counter.t -> Export.string ->
Counter.t
but an expression was expected of type
'a list -> Export.string -> 'a list
Type Counter.t is not compatible with type 'a list
[1]
This is because freq.ml depends on the fact that frequency counts are represented
as association lists, a fact that we've just hidden. We just need to x build_counts to
use Counter.empty instead of [] and to use Counter.to_list to convert the completed
counts to an association list. The resulting implementation is shown below.
open Base
open Stdio
let build_counts () =
In_channel.fold_lines
In_channel.stdin
~init:Counter.empty
~f:Counter.touch
let () =
build_counts ()
|> Counter.to_list
|> List.sort ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) -> Int.descending x y)
|> (fun counts -> List.take counts 10)
|> List.iter ~f:(fun (line, count) -> printf "%3d: %s\n" count line)
With this implementation, the build now succeeds!
$ dune build freq.exe
Now we can turn to optimizing the implementation of Counter. Here's an alternate
and far more ecient implementation, based on Base's Map data structure.
open Base
type t = int Map.M(String).t
let empty = Map.empty (module String)
let to_list t = Map.to_alist t

5.4 Concrete Types in Signatures
73
let touch t s =
let count =
match Map.find t s with
| None -> 0
| Some x -> x
in
Map.set t ~key:s ~data:(count + 1)
There's some unfamiliar syntax in the above example, in particular the use of int
Map.M(String).t to indicate the type of a map, and Map.empty (module String) to
generate an empty map. Here, we're making use of a more advanced feature of the
language (specically, functors and rst-class modules, which we'll get to in later
chapters). The use of these features for the Map data-structure in particular is covered
in Chapter 15 (Maps and Hash Tables).
5.4
Concrete Types in Signatures
In our frequency-count example, the module Counter had an abstract type Counter.t
for representing a collection of frequency counts. Sometimes, you'll want to make a
type in your interface concrete, by including the type denition in the interface.
For example, imagine we wanted to add a function to Counter for returning the line
with the median frequency count. If the number of lines is even, then there is no single
median, and the function would return the lines before and after the median instead.
We'll use a custom type to represent the fact that there are two possible return values.
Here's a possible implementation:
type median =
| Median of string
| Before_and_after of string * string
let median t =
let sorted_strings =
List.sort (Map.to_alist t) ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) ->
Int.descending x y)
in
let len = List.length sorted_strings in
if len = 0 then failwith "median: empty frequency count";
let nth n = fst (List.nth_exn sorted_strings n) in
if len % 2 = 1
then Median (nth (len / 2))
else Before_and_after (nth ((len / 2) - 1), nth (len / 2))
In the above, we use failwith to throw an exception for the case of the empty
list. We'll discuss exceptions more in Chapter 8 (Error Handling). Note also that the
function fst simply returns the rst element of any two-tuple.
Now, to expose this usefully in the interface, we need to expose both the function
and the type median with its denition. Note that values (of which functions are an
example) and types have distinct namespaces, so there's no name clash here. Adding
the following two lines to counter.mli does the trick.

74
Files, Modules, and Programs
(** Represents the median computed from a set of strings. In the case
where there is an even number of choices, the one before and after
the median is returned. *)
type median =
| Median of string
| Before_and_after of string * string
val median : t -> median
The decision of whether a given type should be abstract or concrete is an important
one. Abstract types give you more control over how values are created and accessed,
and make it easier to enforce invariants beyond what is enforced by the type itself;
concrete types let you expose more detail and structure to client code in a lightweight
way. The right choice depends very much on the context.
5.5
Nested Modules
Up until now, we've only considered modules that correspond to les, like counter.ml.
But modules (and module signatures) can be nested inside other modules. As a simple
example, consider a program that needs to deal with multiple identiers like usernames
and hostnames. If you just represent these as strings, then it becomes easy to confuse
one with the other.
A better approach is to mint new abstract types for each identier, where those types
are under the covers just implemented as strings. That way, the type system will prevent
you from confusing a username with a hostname, and if you do need to convert, you
can do so using explicit conversions to and from the string type.
Here's how you might create such an abstract type, within a submodule:
open Base
module Username : sig
type t
val of_string : string -> t
val to_string : t -> string
val ( = ) : t -> t -> bool
end = struct
type t = string
let of_string x = x
let to_string x = x
let ( = ) = String.( = )
end
Note that the to_string and of_string functions above are implemented simply as
the identity function, which means they have no runtime eect. They are there purely
as part of the discipline that they enforce on the code through the type system. We also
chose to put in an equality function, so you can check if two usernames match. In a real
application, we might want more functionality, like the ability to hash and compare
usernames, but we've kept this example purposefully simple.

5.6 Opening Modules
75
The basic structure of a module declaration like this is:
module <name> : <signature> = <implementation>
We could have written this slightly dierently, by giving the signature its own top-
level module type declaration, making it possible to create multiple distinct types with
the same underlying implementation in a lightweight way:
open Base
module Time = Core.Time
module type ID = sig
type t
val of_string : string -> t
val to_string : t -> string
val ( = ) : t -> t -> bool
end
module String_id = struct
type t = string
let of_string x = x
let to_string x = x
let ( = ) = String.( = )
end
module Username : ID = String_id
module Hostname : ID = String_id
type session_info =
{ user : Username.t
; host : Hostname.t
; when_started : Time.t
}
let sessions_have_same_user s1 s2 = Username.( = ) s1.user s2.host
The preceding code has a bug: it compares the username in one session to the host in
the other session, when it should be comparing the usernames in both cases. Because
of how we dened our types, however, the compiler will ag this bug for us.
$ dune build session_info.exe
File "session_info.ml", line 29, characters 59-66:
29 | let sessions_have_same_user s1 s2 = Username.( = ) s1.user
s2.host
^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type Hostname.t
but an expression was expected of type Username.t
[1]
This is a trivial example, but confusing dierent kinds of identiers is a very real
source of bugs, and the approach of minting abstract types for dierent classes of
identiers is an eective way of avoiding such issues.

76
Files, Modules, and Programs
5.6
Opening Modules
Most of the time, you refer to values and types within a module by using the module
name as an explicit qualier. For example, you write List.map to refer to the map
function in the List module. Sometimes, though, you want to be able to refer to the
contents of a module without this explicit qualication. That's what the open statement
is for.
We've encountered open already, specically where we've written open Base to get
access to the standard denitions in the Base library. In general, opening a module
adds the contents of that module to the environment that the compiler looks at to nd
the denition of various identiers. Here's an example:
# module M = struct let foo = 3 end;;
module M : sig val foo : int end
# foo;;
Line 1, characters 1-4:
Error: Unbound value foo
# open M;;
# foo;;
- : int = 3
Here's some general advice on how to use open eectively.
5.6.1
Open Modules Rarely
open is essential when you're using an alternative standard library like Base, but it's
generally good style to keep the opening of modules to a minimum. Opening a module
is basically a trade-o between terseness and explicitnessthe more modules you
open, the fewer module qualications you need, and the harder it is to look at an
identier and gure out where it comes from.
When you do use open, it should mostly be with modules that were designed to be
opened, like Base itself, or Option.Monad_infix or Float.O within Base..
5.6.2
Prefer Local Opens
It's generally better to keep down the amount of code aected by an open. One great
tool for this is local opens, which let you restrict the scope of an open to an arbitrary
expression. There are two syntaxes for local opens. The following example shows the
let open syntax;
# let average x y =
let open Int64 in
(x + y) / of_int 2;;
val average : int64 -> int64 -> int64 = <fun>
Here, of_int and the inx operators are the ones from the Int64 module.
The following shows o a more lightweight syntax which is particularly useful for
small expressions.

5.7 Including Modules
77
# let average x y =
Int64.((x + y) / of_int 2);;
val average : int64 -> int64 -> int64 = <fun>
5.6.3
Using Module Shortcuts Instead
An alternative to local opens that makes your code terser without giving up on explic-
itness is to locally rebind the name of a module. So, when using the Counter.median
type, instead of writing:
let print_median m =
match m with
| Counter.Median string -> printf "True median:\n
%s\n" string
| Counter.Before_and_after (before, after) ->
printf "Before and after median:\n
%s\n
%s\n" before after
you could write:
let print_median m =
let module C = Counter in
match m with
| C.Median string -> printf "True median:\n
%s\n" string
| C.Before_and_after (before, after) ->
printf "Before and after median:\n
%s\n
%s\n" before after
Because the module name C only exists for a short scope, it's easy to read and
remember what C stands for. Rebinding modules to very short names at the top level
of your module is usually a mistake.
5.7
Including Modules
While opening a module aects the environment used to search for identiers, including
a module is a way of adding new identiers to a module proper. Consider the following
simple module for representing a range of integer values:
# module Interval = struct
type t = | Interval of int * int
| Empty
let create low high =
if high < low then Empty else Interval (low,high)
end;;
module Interval :
sig type t = Interval of int * int | Empty val create : int -> int
-> t end
We can use the include directive to create a new, extended version of the Interval
module:
# module Extended_interval = struct
include Interval

78
Files, Modules, and Programs
let contains t x =
match t with
| Empty -> false
| Interval (low,high) -> x >= low && x <= high
end;;
module Extended_interval :
sig
type t = Interval.t = Interval of int * int | Empty
val create : int -> int -> t
val contains : t -> int -> bool
end
# Extended_interval.contains (Extended_interval.create 3 10) 4;;
- : bool = true
The dierence between include and open is that we've done more than change how
identiers are searched for: we've changed what's in the module. If we'd used open,
we'd have gotten a quite dierent result:
# module Extended_interval = struct
open Interval
let contains t x =
match t with
| Empty -> false
| Interval (low,high) -> x >= low && x <= high
end;;
module Extended_interval :
sig val contains : Extended_interval.t -> int -> bool end
# Extended_interval.contains (Extended_interval.create 3 10) 4;;
Line 1, characters 29-53:
Error: Unbound value Extended_interval.create
To consider a more realistic example, imagine you wanted to build an extended
version of the Option module, where you've added some functionality not present in
the module as distributed in Base. That's a job for include.
open Base
(* The new function we're going to add *)
let apply f_opt x =
match f_opt with
| None -> None
| Some f -> Some (f x)
(* The remainder of the option module *)
include Option
Now, how do we write an interface for this new module? It turns out that include
works on signatures as well, so we can pull essentially the same trick to write our mli.
The only issue is that we need to get our hands on the signature for the Option module.
This can be done using module type of, which computes a signature from a module:
open Base
(* Include the interface of the option module from Base *)
include module type of Option

5.8 Missing Denitions
79
(* Signature of function we're adding *)
val apply : ('a -> 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b t
Note that the order of declarations in the mli does not need to match the order of
declarations in the ml. The order of declarations in the ml mostly matters insofar as it
aects which values are shadowed. If we wanted to replace a function in Option with
a new function of the same name, the declaration of that function in the ml would have
to come after the include Option declaration.
We can now use Ext_option as a replacement for Option. If we want to use
Ext_option in preference to Option in our project, we can create a le of common
denitions, which in this case we'll call import.ml.
module Option = Ext_option
Then, by opening Import, we can shadow Base's Option module with our extension.
open Base
open Import
let lookup_and_apply map key x = Option.apply (Map.find map key) x
5.8
Common Errors with Modules
When OCaml compiles a program with an ml and an mli, it will complain if it detects
a mismatch between the two. Here are some of the common errors you'll run into.
5.8.1
Type Mismatches
The simplest kind of error is where the type specied in the signature does not match
the type in the implementation of the module. As an example, if we replace the val
declaration in counter.mli by swapping the types of the rst two arguments:
(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)
val touch : string -> t -> t
and we try to compile, we'll get the following error.
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 1:
Error: The implementation counter.ml
does not match the interface
.freq.eobjs/byte/dune__exe__Counter.cmi:
Values do not match:
val touch :
('a, int, 'b) Base.Map.t -> 'a -> ('a, int, 'b) Base.Map.t
is not included in
val touch : string -> t -> t
File "counter.mli", line 16, characters 0-28: Expected
declaration
File "counter.ml", line 8, characters 4-9: Actual declaration
[1]

80
Files, Modules, and Programs
5.8.2
Missing Denitions
We might decide that we want a new function in Counter for pulling out the frequency
count of a given string. We could add that to the mli by adding the following line.
(** Returns the frequency count for the given string *)
val count : t -> string -> int
Now if we try to compile without actually adding the implementation, we'll get this
error.
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 1:
Error: The implementation counter.ml
does not match the interface
.freq.eobjs/byte/dune__exe__Counter.cmi:
The value `count' is required but not provided
File "counter.mli", line 15, characters 0-30: Expected
declaration
[1]
A missing type denition will lead to a similar error.
5.8.3
Type Denition Mismatches
Type denitions that show up in an mli need to match up with corresponding de-
nitions in the ml. Consider again the example of the type median. The order of the
declaration of variants matters to the OCaml compiler, so the denition of median in
the implementation listing those options in a dierent order:
(** Represents the median computed from a set of strings. In the case
where there is an even number of choices, the one before and after
the median is returned. *)
type median =
| Before_and_after of string * string
| Median of string
val median : t -> median
will lead to a compilation error.
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 1:
Error: The implementation counter.ml
does not match the interface
.freq.eobjs/byte/dune__exe__Counter.cmi:
Type declarations do not match:
type median = Median of string | Before_and_after of string
* string
is not included in
type median = Before_and_after of string * string | Median
of string
Constructors number 1 have different names, Median and
Before_and_after.
File "counter.mli", lines 21-23, characters 0-20: Expected
declaration

5.9 Designing with Modules
81
File "counter.ml", lines 17-19, characters 0-39: Actual
declaration
[1]
Order is similarly important to other type declarations, including the order in which
record elds are declared and the order of arguments (including labeled and optional
arguments) to a function.
5.8.4
Cyclic Dependencies
In most cases, OCaml doesn't allow cyclic dependencies, i.e., a collection of denitions
that all refer to one another. If you want to create such denitions, you typically have
to mark them specially. For example, when dening a set of mutually recursive values
(like the denition of is_even and is_odd in Chapter 3.2.3 (Recursive Functions)), you
need to dene them using let rec rather than ordinary let.
The same is true at the module level. By default, cyclic dependencies between
modules are not allowed, and cyclic dependencies among les are never allowed.
Recursive modules are possible but are a rare case, and we won't discuss them further
here.
The simplest example of a forbidden circular reference is a module referring to
its own module name. So, if we tried to add a reference to Counter from within
counter.ml.
let singleton l = Counter.touch Counter.empty
we'll see this error when we try to build:
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 18, characters 18-31:
18 | let singleton l = Counter.touch Counter.empty
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: The module Counter is an alias for module Dune__exe__Counter,
which is the current compilation unit
[1]
The problem manifests in a dierent way if we create cyclic references between
les. We could create such a situation by adding a reference to Freq from counter.ml,
e.g., by adding the following line.
let _build_counts = Freq.build_counts
In this case, dune will notice the error and complain explicitly about the cycle:
$ dune build freq.exe
Error: Dependency cycle between the following files:
_build/default/.freq.eobjs/freq.impl.all-deps
-> _build/default/.freq.eobjs/counter.impl.all-deps
-> _build/default/.freq.eobjs/freq.impl.all-deps

5.9
Designing with Modules
The module system is a key part of how an OCaml program is structured. As such,
we'll close this chapter with some advice on how to think about designing that structure
eectively.
5.9.1
Expose Concrete Types Rarely
When designing an mli, one choice that you need to make is whether to expose the
concrete denition of your types or leave them abstract. Most of the time, abstraction
is the right choice, for two reasons: it enhances the exibility of your design, and it
makes it possible to enforce invariants on the use of your module.
Abstraction enhances exibility by restricting how users can interact with your types,
thus reducing the ways in which users can depend on the details of your implementation.
If you expose types explicitly, then users can depend on any and every detail of the types
you choose. If they're abstract, then only the specic operations you want to expose are
available. This means that you can freely change the implementation without aecting
clients, as long as you preserve the semantics of those operations.
In a similar way, abstraction allows you to enforce invariants on your types. If your
types are exposed, then users of the module can create new instances of that type (or
if mutable, modify existing instances) in any way allowed by the underlying type. That
may violate a desired invariant i.e., a property about your type that is always supposed
to be true. Abstract types allow you to protect invariants by making sure that you only
expose functions that preserve your invariants.
Despite these benets, there is a trade-o here. In particular, exposing types con-
cretely makes it possible to use pattern-matching with those types, which as we saw in
Chapter 4 (Lists and Patterns) is a powerful and important tool. You should generally
only expose the concrete implementation of your types when there's signicant value
in the ability to pattern match, and when the invariants that you care about are already
enforced by the data type itself.
5.9.2
Design for the Call Site
When writing an interface, you should think not just about how easy it is to understand
the interface for someone who reads your carefully documented mli le, but more
importantly, you want the call to be as obvious as possible for someone who is reading
it at the call site.
The reason for this is that most of the time, people interacting with your API will
be doing so by reading and modifying code that uses the API, not by reading the
interface denition. By making your API as obvious as possible from that perspective,
you simplify the lives of your users.
There are many ways of improving readability of client code. One example is
labeled arguments (discussed in Chapter 3.2.6 (Labeled Arguments)), which act as
documentation that is available at the call site.

5.9 Interfaces Before Implementations
83
You can also improve readability simply by choosing good names for your functions,
variant tags and record elds. Good names aren't always long, to be clear. If you wanted
to write an anonymous function for doubling a number: (fun x -> x * 2), a short
variable name like x is best. A good rule of thumb is that names that have a small scope
should be short, whereas names that have a large scope, like the name of a function in
a module interface, should be longer and more descriptive.
There is of course a tradeo here, in that making your APIs more explicit tends to
make them more verbose as well. Another useful rule of thumb is that more rarely used
names should be longer and more explicit, since the cost of verbosity goes down and
the benet of explicitness goes up the less often a name is used.
5.9.3
Create Uniform Interfaces
Designing the interface of a module is a task that should not be thought of in isolation.
The interfaces that appear in your codebase should play together harmoniously. Part of
achieving that is standardizing aspects of those interfaces.
Base, Core and related libraries have been designed with a uniform set of standards
in mind around the design of module interfaces. Here are some of the guidelines that
they use.
• A module for (almost) every type. You should mint a module for almost every type
in your program, and the primary type of a given module should be called t.
• Put t rst. If you have a module M whose primary type is M.t, the functions in M that
take a value of type M.t should take it as their rst argument.
• Functions that routinely throw an exception should end in _exn. Otherwise, errors
should be signaled by returning an option or an Or_error.t (both of which are
discussed in Chapter 8 (Error Handling) ).
There are also standards in Base about what the type signature for specic functions
should be. For example, the signature for map is always essentially the same, no
matter what the underlying type it is applied to. This kind of function-by-function
API uniformity is achieved through the use of signature includes, which allow for
dierent modules to share components of their interface. This approach is described
in Chapter 11.2.4 (Using Multiple Interfaces).
Base's standards may or may not t your projects, but you can improve the usability
of your codebase by nding some consistent set of standards to apply.
5.9.4
Interfaces Before Implementations
OCaml's concise and exible type language enables a type-oriented approach to soft-
ware design. Such an approach involves thinking through and writing out the types
you're going to use before embarking on the implementation itself.
This is a good approach both when working in the core language, where you would
write your type denitions before writing the logic of your computations, as well as at

84
Files, Modules, and Programs
the module level, where you would write a rst draft of your mli before working on
the ml.
Of course, the design process goes in both directions. You'll often nd yourself
going back and modifying your types in response to things you learn by working on the
implementation. But types and signatures provide a lightweight tool for constructing
a skeleton of your design in a way that helps clarify your goals and intent, before you
spend a lot of time and eort eshing it out.

6
Records
One of OCaml's best features is its concise and expressive system for declaring new
data types. Records are a key element of that system. We discussed records briey in
Chapter 2 (A Guided Tour), but this chapter will go into more depth, covering more of
the technical details, as well as providing advice on how to use records eectively in
your software designs.
A record represents a collection of values stored together as one, where each compo-
nent is identied by a dierent eld name. The basic syntax for a record type declaration
is as follows:
type <record-name> =
{ <field> : <type>;
<field> : <type>;
...
}
Note that record eld names must start with a lowercase letter.
Here's a simple example: a service_info record that represents an entry from the
/etc/services le on a typical Unix system. That le is used for keeping track of the
well-known port and protocol name for protocols such as FTP or SSH. Note that we're
going to open Core in this example rather than Base, since we're using the Unix API,
which you need Core for.
open Core
type service_info =
{ service_name : string;
port
: int;
protocol
: string;
}
We can construct a service_info just as easily as we declared its type. The following
function tries to construct such a record given as input a line from /etc/services le.
To do this, we'll use Re, a regular expression engine for OCaml. If you don't know how
regular expressions work, you can just think of them as a simple pattern language you
can use for parsing a string. (You may need to install it rst by running opam install
re.)
# #require "re";;
# let service_info_of_string line =
let matches =
let pat = "([a-zA-Z]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)" in

86
Records
Re.exec (Re.Posix.compile_pat pat) line
in
{ service_name = Re.Group.get matches 1;
port = Int.of_string (Re.Group.get matches 2);
protocol = Re.Group.get matches 3;
}
;;
val service_info_of_string : string -> service_info = <fun>
We can now construct a concrete record by calling the function on a line from the le.
# let ssh = service_info_of_string "ssh 22/udp # SSH Remote Login
Protocol";;
val ssh : service_info = {service_name = "ssh"; port = 22; protocol =
"udp"}
You might wonder how the compiler inferred that our function returns a value of
type service_info. In this case, the compiler bases its inference on the eld names
used in constructing the record. That inference is most straightforward when each eld
name belongs to only one record type. We'll discuss later in the chapter what happens
when eld names are shared across dierent record types.
Once we have a record value in hand, we can extract elements from the record eld
using dot notation:
# ssh.port;;
- : int = 22
When declaring an OCaml type, you always have the option of parameterizing it by
a polymorphic type. Records are no dierent in this regard. As an example, here's a
type that represents an arbitrary item tagged with a line number.
type 'a with_line_num = { item: 'a; line_num: int }
We can then write polymorphic functions that operate over this parameterized type.
For example, this function takes a le and parses it as a series of lines, using the
provided function for parsing each individual line.
# let parse_lines parse file_contents =
let lines = String.split ~on:'\n' file_contents in
List.mapi lines ~f:(fun line_num line ->
{ item = parse line;
line_num = line_num + 1;
})
;;
val parse_lines : (string -> 'a) -> string -> 'a with_line_num list =
<fun>
We can then use this function for parsing a snippet of a real /etc/services le.
# parse_lines service_info_of_string
"rtmp
1/ddp
# Routing Table Maintenance Protocol
tcpmux
1/udp
# TCP Port Service Multiplexer
tcpmux
1/tcp
# TCP Port Service Multiplexer";;
- : service_info with_line_num list =
[{item = {service_name = "rtmp"; port = 1; protocol = "ddp"};
line_num = 1};

6.1 Patterns and Exhaustiveness
87
{item = {service_name = "tcpmux"; port = 1; protocol = "udp"};
line_num = 2};
{item = {service_name = "tcpmux"; port = 1; protocol = "tcp"};
line_num = 3}]
The polymorphism lets us use the same function when parsing a dierent format,
like this function for parsing a le containing an integer on every line.
# parse_lines Int.of_string "1\n10\n100\n1000";;
- : int with_line_num list =
[{item = 1; line_num = 1}; {item = 10; line_num = 2};
{item = 100; line_num = 3}; {item = 1000; line_num = 4}]
6.1
Patterns and Exhaustiveness
Another way of getting information out of a record is by using a pattern match, as
shown in the following function.
# let service_info_to_string
{ service_name = name; port = port; protocol = prot
}
=
sprintf "%s %i/%s" name port prot
;;
val service_info_to_string : service_info -> string = <fun>
# service_info_to_string ssh;;
- : string = "ssh 22/udp"
Note that the pattern we used had only a single case, rather than using several cases
separated by |'s. We needed only one pattern because record patterns are irrefutable,
meaning that a record pattern match will never fail at runtime. That's because the set
of elds available in a record is always the same. In general, patterns for types with
a xed structure, like records and tuples, are irrefutable, unlike types with variable
structures like lists and variants.
Another important characteristic of record patterns is that they don't need to be
complete; a pattern can mention only a subset of the elds in the record. This can be
convenient, but it can also be error prone. In particular, this means that when new elds
are added to the record, code that should be updated to react to the presence of those
new elds will not be agged by the compiler.
As an example, imagine that we wanted to change our service_info record so that
it preserves comments. We can do this by providing a new denition of service_info
that includes a comment eld:
type service_info =
{ service_name : string;
port
: int;
protocol
: string;
comment
: string option;
}
The code for service_info_to_string would continue to compile without change.
But in this case, we should probably update the code so that the generated string

88
Records
includes the comment if it's there. It would be nice if the type system would warn us
that we should consider updating the function.
Happily, OCaml oers an optional warning for missing elds in record patterns.
With that warning turned on (which you can do in the toplevel by typing #warnings
"+9"), the compiler will indeed warn us.
# #warnings "+9";;
# let service_info_to_string
{ service_name = name; port = port; protocol = prot
}
=
sprintf "%s %i/%s" name port prot
;;
Line 2, characters 5-59:
Warning 9 [missing-record-field-pattern]: the following labels are
not bound in this record pattern:
comment
Either bind these labels explicitly or add '; _' to the pattern.
val service_info_to_string : service_info -> string = <fun>
We can disable the warning for a given pattern by explicitly acknowledging that we
are ignoring extra elds. This is done by adding an underscore to the pattern:
# let service_info_to_string
{ service_name = name; port = port; protocol = prot; _ }
=
sprintf "%s %i/%s" name port prot
;;
val service_info_to_string : service_info -> string = <fun>
It's a good idea to enable the warning for incomplete record matches and to explicitly
disable it with an _ where necessary.
Compiler Warnings
The OCaml compiler is packed full of useful warnings that can be enabled and disabled
separately. These are documented in the compiler itself, so we could have found out
about warning 9 as follows:
$ ocaml -warn-help | egrep '\b9\b'
9 [missing-record-field-pattern] Missing fields in a record pattern.
R Alias for warning 9.
You can think of OCaml's warnings as a powerful set of optional static analysis tools.
They're enormously helpful in catching all sorts of bugs, and you should enable them
in your build environment. You don't typically enable all warnings, but the defaults
that ship with the compiler are pretty good.
The warnings used for building the examples in this book are specied with the
following ag: -w @A-4-33-40-41-42-43-34-44.
The syntax of -w can be found by running ocaml -help, but this particular invocation
turns on all warnings as errors, disabling only the numbers listed explicitly after the A.
Treating warnings as errors (i.e., making OCaml fail to compile any code that
triggers a warning) is good practice, since without it, warnings are too often ignored
during development. When preparing a package for distribution, however, this is a bad

6.2 Field Punning
89
idea, since the list of warnings may grow from one release of the compiler to another,
and so this may lead your package to fail to compile on newer compiler releases.
6.2
Field Punning
When the name of a variable coincides with the name of a record eld, OCaml provides
some handy syntactic shortcuts. For example, the pattern in the following function binds
all of the elds in question to variables of the same name. This is called eld punning:
# let service_info_to_string { service_name; port; protocol; comment
} =
let base = sprintf "%s %i/%s" service_name port protocol in
match comment with
| None -> base
| Some text -> base ^ " #" ^ text;;
val service_info_to_string : service_info -> string = <fun>
Field punning can also be used to construct a record. Consider the following updated
version of service_info_of_string.
# let service_info_of_string line =
(* first, split off any comment *)
let (line,comment) =
match String.rsplit2 line ~on:'#' with
| None -> (line,None)
| Some (ordinary,comment) -> (ordinary, Some comment)
in
(* now, use a regular expression to break up the
service definition *)
let matches =
Re.exec
(Re.Posix.compile_pat
"([a-zA-Z]+)[ \t]+([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)")
line
in
let service_name = Re.Group.get matches 1 in
let port = Int.of_string (Re.Group.get matches 2) in
let protocol = Re.Group.get matches 3 in
{ service_name; port; protocol; comment };;
val service_info_of_string : string -> service_info = <fun>
In the preceding code, we dened variables corresponding to the record elds rst,
and then the record declaration itself simply listed the elds that needed to be included.
You can take advantage of both eld punning and label punning when writing a function
for constructing a record from labeled arguments:
# let create_service_info ~service_name ~port ~protocol ~comment =
{ service_name; port; protocol; comment };;
val create_service_info :
service_name:string ->
port:int -> protocol:string -> comment:string option ->
service_info =
<fun>

90
Records
This is considerably more concise than what you would get without punning:
# let create_service_info
~service_name:service_name ~port:port
~protocol:protocol ~comment:comment =
{ service_name = service_name;
port = port;
protocol = protocol;
comment = comment;
};;
val create_service_info :
service_name:string ->
port:int -> protocol:string -> comment:string option ->
service_info =
<fun>
Together, eld and label punning encourage a style where you propagate the same
names throughout your codebase. This is generally good practice, since it encourages
consistent naming, which makes it easier to navigate the source.
6.3
Reusing Field Names
Dening records with the same eld names can be problematic. As a simple example,
let's consider a collection of types representing the protocol of a logging server.
We'll describe three message types: log_entry, heartbeat, and logon. The
log_entry message is used to deliver a log entry to the server; the logon message
is sent when initiating a connection and includes the identity of the user connecting
and credentials used for authentication; and the heartbeat message is periodically sent
by the client to demonstrate to the server that the client is alive and connected. All of
these messages include a session ID and the time the message was generated.
type log_entry =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
important: bool;
message: string;
}
type heartbeat =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
status_message: string;
}
type logon =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
user: string;
credentials: string;
}
Reusing eld names can lead to some ambiguity. For example, if we want to write
a function to grab the session_id from a record, what type will it have?
# let get_session_id t = t.session_id;;

6.3 Reusing Field Names
91
val get_session_id : logon -> string = <fun>
In this case, OCaml just picks the most recent denition of that record eld. We can
force OCaml to assume we're dealing with a dierent type (say, a heartbeat) using a
type annotation:
# let get_heartbeat_session_id (t:heartbeat) = t.session_id;;
val get_heartbeat_session_id : heartbeat -> string = <fun>
While it's possible to resolve ambiguous eld names using type annotations, the
ambiguity can be a bit confusing. Consider the following functions for grabbing the
session ID and status from a heartbeat:
# let status_and_session t = (t.status_message, t.session_id);;
val status_and_session : heartbeat -> string * string = <fun>
# let session_and_status t = (t.session_id, t.status_message);;
Line 1, characters 45-59:
Error: This expression has type logon
There is no field status_message within type logon
Why did the rst denition succeed without a type annotation and the second
one fail? The dierence is that in the rst case, the type-checker considered the
status_message eld rst and thus concluded that the record was a heartbeat. When
the order was switched, the session_id eld was considered rst, and so that drove
the type to be considered to be a logon, at which point t.status_message no longer
made sense.
Adding a type annotation resolves the ambiguity, no matter what order the elds are
considered in.
# let session_and_status (t:heartbeat) = (t.session_id,
t.status_message);;
val session_and_status : heartbeat -> string * string = <fun>
We can avoid the ambiguity altogether, either by using nonoverlapping eld names
or by putting dierent record types in dierent modules. Indeed, packing types into
modules is a broadly useful idiom (and one used quite extensively by Base), providing
for each type a namespace within which to put related values. When using this style,
it is standard practice to name the type associated with the module t. So, we would
write:
module Log_entry = struct
type t =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
important: bool;
message: string;
}
end
module Heartbeat = struct
type t =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
status_message: string;
}

92
Records
end
module Logon = struct
type t =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
user: string;
credentials: string;
}
end
Now, our log-entry-creation function can be rendered as follows:
# let create_log_entry ~session_id ~important message =
{ Log_entry.time = Time_ns.now ();
Log_entry.session_id;
Log_entry.important;
Log_entry.message
};;
val create_log_entry :
session_id:string -> important:bool -> string -> Log_entry.t = <fun>
The module name Log_entry is required to qualify the elds, because this function is
outside of the Log_entry module where the record was dened. OCaml only requires
the module qualication for one record eld, however, so we can write this more
concisely. Note that we are allowed to insert whitespace between the module path and
the eld name:
# let create_log_entry ~session_id ~important message =
{ Log_entry.
time = Time_ns.now (); session_id; important; message };;
val create_log_entry :
session_id:string -> important:bool -> string -> Log_entry.t = <fun>
Earlier, we saw that you could help OCaml understand which record eld was
intended by adding a type annotation. We can use that here to make the example even
more concise.
# let create_log_entry ~session_id ~important message : Log_entry.t =
{ time = Time_ns.now (); session_id; important; message };;
val create_log_entry :
session_id:string -> important:bool -> string -> Log_entry.t = <fun>
This is not restricted to constructing a record; we can use the same approaches when
pattern matching:
# let message_to_string { Log_entry.important; message; _ } =
if important then String.uppercase message else message;;
val message_to_string : Log_entry.t -> string = <fun>
When using dot notation for accessing record elds, we can qualify the eld by the
module as well.
# let is_important t = t.Log_entry.important;;
val is_important : Log_entry.t -> bool = <fun>
The syntax here is a little surprising when you rst encounter it. The thing to keep
in mind is that the dot is being used in two ways: the rst dot is a record eld access,

6.4 Functional Updates
93
with everything to the right of the dot being interpreted as a eld name; the second
dot is accessing the contents of a module, referring to the record eld important from
within the module Log_entry. The fact that Log_entry is capitalized and so can't be a
eld name is what disambiguates the two uses.
Qualifying a record eld by the module it comes from can be awkward. Happily,
OCaml doesn't require that the record eld be qualied if it can otherwise infer the
type of the record in question. In particular, we can rewrite the above declarations by
adding type annotations and removing the module qualications.
# let message_to_string ({ important; message; _ } : Log_entry.t) =
if important then String.uppercase message else message;;
val message_to_string : Log_entry.t -> string = <fun>
# let is_important (t:Log_entry.t) = t.important;;
val is_important : Log_entry.t -> bool = <fun>
This feature of the language, known by the somewhat imposing name of type-
directed constructor disambiguation, applies to variant tags as well as record elds, as
we'll see in Chapter 7 (Variants).
6.4
Functional Updates
Fairly often, you will nd yourself wanting to create a new record that diers from an
existing record in only a subset of the elds. For example, imagine our logging server
had a record type for representing the state of a given client, including when the last
heartbeat was received from that client.
type client_info =
{ addr: Unix.Inet_addr.t;
port: int;
user: string;
credentials: string;
last_heartbeat_time: Time_ns.t;
}
We could dene a function for updating the client information when a new heartbeat
arrives as follows.
# let register_heartbeat t hb =
{ addr = t.addr;
port = t.port;
user = t.user;
credentials = t.credentials;
last_heartbeat_time = hb.Heartbeat.time;
};;
val register_heartbeat : client_info -> Heartbeat.t -> client_info =
<fun>
This is fairly verbose, given that there's only one eld that we actually want to
change, and all the others are just being copied over from t. We can use OCaml's
functional update syntax to do this more tersely.
The
following
shows
how
we
can
use
functional
updates
to
rewrite
register_heartbeat more concisely.

94
Records
# let register_heartbeat t hb =
{ t with last_heartbeat_time = hb.Heartbeat.time };;
val register_heartbeat : client_info -> Heartbeat.t -> client_info =
<fun>
The with keyword marks that this is a functional update, and the value assignments
on the right-hand side indicate the changes to be made to the record on the left-hand
side of the with.
Functional updates make your code independent of the identity of the elds in the
record that are not changing. This is often what you want, but it has downsides as
well. In particular, if you change the denition of your record to have more elds, the
type system will not prompt you to reconsider whether your code needs to change to
accommodate the new elds. Consider what happens if we decided to add a eld for
the status message received on the last heartbeat:
type client_info =
{ addr: Unix.Inet_addr.t;
port: int;
user: string;
credentials: string;
last_heartbeat_time: Time_ns.t;
last_heartbeat_status: string;
}
The original implementation of register_heartbeat would now be invalid, and
thus the compiler would eectively warn us to think about how to handle this new eld.
But the version using a functional update continues to compile as is, even though it
incorrectly ignores the new eld. The correct thing to do would be to update the code
as follows:
# let register_heartbeat t hb =
{ t with last_heartbeat_time
= hb.Heartbeat.time;
last_heartbeat_status = hb.Heartbeat.status_message;
};;
val register_heartbeat : client_info -> Heartbeat.t -> client_info =
<fun>
These downsides notwithstanding, functional updates are very useful, and a good
choice for cases where it's not important that you consider every eld of the record
when making a change.
6.5
Mutable Fields
Like most OCaml values, records are immutable by default. You can, however, declare
individual record elds as mutable. In the following code, we've made the last two
elds of client_info mutable:
type client_info =
{ addr: Unix.Inet_addr.t;
port: int;
user: string;

6.6 First-Class Fields
95
credentials: string;
mutable last_heartbeat_time: Time_ns.t;
mutable last_heartbeat_status: string;
}
The <- operator is used for setting a mutable eld. The side-eecting version of
register_heartbeat would be written as follows:
# let register_heartbeat t (hb:Heartbeat.t) =
t.last_heartbeat_time
<- hb.time;
t.last_heartbeat_status <- hb.status_message;;
val register_heartbeat : client_info -> Heartbeat.t -> unit = <fun>
Note that mutable assignment, and thus the <- operator, is not needed for initial-
ization because all elds of a record, including mutable ones, are specied when the
record is created.
OCaml's policy of immutable-by-default is a good one, but imperative programming
is an important part of programming in OCaml. We go into more depth about how (and
when) to use OCaml's imperative features in Chapter 9 (Imperative Programming).
6.6
First-Class Fields
Consider the following function for extracting the usernames from a list of Logon
messages:
# let get_users logons =
List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare
(List.map logons ~f:(fun x -> x.Logon.user));;
val get_users : Logon.t list -> string list = <fun>
Here, we wrote a small function (fun x -> x.Logon.user) to access the user eld.
This kind of accessor function is a common enough pattern that it would be convenient
to generate it automatically. The ppx_fields_conv syntax extension that ships with
Core does just that.
The [@@deriving fields] annotation at the end of the declaration of a record type
will cause the extension to be applied to a given type declaration. We need to enable
the extension explicitly,
# #require "ppx_jane";;
at which point, we can dene Logon as follows:
# module Logon = struct
type t =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
user: string;
credentials: string;
}
[@@deriving fields]
end;;
module Logon :

96
Records
sig
type t = {
session_id : string;
time : Time_ns.t;
user : string;
credentials : string;
}
val credentials : t -> string
val user : t -> string
val time : t -> Time_ns.t
val session_id : t -> string
module Fields :
sig
val names : string list
val credentials :
([< `Read | `Set_and_create ], t, string) Field.t_with_perm
val user :
([< `Read | `Set_and_create ], t, string) Field.t_with_perm
val time :
([< `Read | `Set_and_create ], t, Time_ns.t)
Field.t_with_perm
...
end
end
Note that this will generate a lot of output because fieldslib generates a large
collection of helper functions for working with record elds. We'll only discuss a few
of these; you can learn about the remainder from the documentation that comes with
fieldslib.
One of the functions we obtain is Logon.user, which we can use to extract the user
eld from a logon message:
# let get_users logons =
List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare
(List.map logons ~f:Logon.user);;
val get_users : Logon.t list -> string list = <fun>
In addition to generating eld accessor functions, fieldslib also creates a submod-
ule called Fields that contains a rst-class representative of each eld, in the form of
a value of type Field.t. The Field module provides the following functions:
Field.name Returns the name of a eld
Field.get Returns the content of a eld
Field.fset Does a functional update of a eld
Field.setter Returns None if the eld is not mutable or Some f if it is, where f is a
function for mutating that eld
A Field.t has two type parameters: the rst for the type of the record, and the second
for the type of the eld in question. Thus, the type of Logon.Fields.session_id is
(Logon.t, string) Field.t, whereas the type of Logon.Fields.time is (Logon.t,
Time.t) Field.t. Thus, if you call Field.get on Logon.Fields.user, you'll get a
function for extracting the user eld from a Logon.t:

6.6 First-Class Fields
97
# Field.get Logon.Fields.user;;
- : Logon.t -> string = <fun>
Thus, the rst parameter of the Field.t corresponds to the record you pass to get,
and the second parameter corresponds to the value contained in the eld, which is also
the return type of get.
The type of Field.get is a little more complicated than you might naively expect
from the preceding one:
# Field.get;;
- : ('b, 'r, 'a) Field.t_with_perm -> 'r -> 'a = <fun>
The type is Field.t_with_perm rather than Field.t because elds have a notion of
access control that comes up in some special cases where we expose the ability to read
a eld from a record, but not the ability to create new records, and so we can't expose
functional updates.
We can use rst-class elds to do things like write a generic function for displaying
a record eld:
# let show_field field to_string record =
let name = Field.name field in
let field_string = to_string (Field.get field record) in
name ^ ": " ^ field_string;;
val show_field :
('a, 'b, 'c) Field.t_with_perm -> ('c -> string) -> 'b -> string =
<fun>
This takes three arguments: the Field.t, a function for converting the contents of
the eld in question to a string, and a record from which the eld can be grabbed.
Here's an example of show_field in action:
# let logon = { Logon.
session_id = "26685";
time = Time_ns.of_string "2017-07-21 10:11:45 EST";
user = "yminsky";
credentials = "Xy2d9W"; };;
val logon : Logon.t =
{Logon.session_id = "26685"; time = 2017-07-21 15:11:45.000000000Z;
user = "yminsky"; credentials = "Xy2d9W"}
# show_field Logon.Fields.user Fn.id logon;;
- : string = "user: yminsky"
# show_field Logon.Fields.time Time_ns.to_string logon;;
- : string = "time: 2017-07-21 15:11:45.000000000Z"
As a side note, the preceding example is our rst use of the Fn module (short for
function), which provides a collection of useful primitives for dealing with functions.
Fn.id is the identity function.
fieldslib also provides higher-level operators, like Fields.fold and Fields.iter,
which let you walk over the elds of a record. So, for example, in the case of Logon.t,
the eld iterator has the following type:
# Logon.Fields.iter;;
- : session_id:(([< `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, string)
Field.t_with_perm -> unit) ->

98
Records
time:(([< `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, Time_ns.t)
Field.t_with_perm -> unit) ->
user:(([< `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, string)
Field.t_with_perm ->
unit) ->
credentials:(([< `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, string)
Field.t_with_perm -> unit) ->
unit
= <fun>
This is a bit daunting to look at, largely because of the access control markers, but
the structure is actually pretty simple. Each labeled argument is a function that takes
a rst-class eld of the necessary type as an argument. Note that iter passes each of
these callbacks the Field.t, not the contents of the specic record eld. The contents
of the eld, though, can be looked up using the combination of the record and the
Field.t.
Now, let's use Logon.Fields.iter and show_field to print out all the elds of a
Logon record:
# let print_logon logon =
let print to_string field =
printf "%s\n" (show_field field to_string logon)
in
Logon.Fields.iter
~session_id:(print Fn.id)
~time:(print Time_ns.to_string)
~user:(print Fn.id)
~credentials:(print Fn.id);;
val print_logon : Logon.t -> unit = <fun>
# print_logon logon;;
session_id: 26685
time: 2017-07-21 15:11:45.000000000Z
user: yminsky
credentials: Xy2d9W
- : unit = ()
One nice side eect of this approach is that it helps you adapt your code when
the elds of a record change. If you were to add a eld to Logon.t, the type of
Logon.Fields.iter would change along with it, acquiring a new argument. Any code
using Logon.Fields.iter won't compile until it's xed to take this new argument into
account.
Field iterators are useful for a variety of record-related tasks, from building record-
validation functions to scaolding the denition of a web form from a record type.
Such applications can benet from the guarantee that all elds of the record type in
question have been considered.

7
Variants
Variant types are one of the most useful features of OCaml and also one of the most
unusual. They let you represent data that may take on multiple dierent forms, where
each form is marked by an explicit tag. As we'll see, when combined with pattern
matching, variants give you a powerful way of representing complex data and of
organizing the case-analysis on that information.
The basic syntax of a variant type declaration is as follows:
type <variant> =
| <Tag> [ of <type> [* <type>]... ]
| <Tag> [ of <type> [* <type>]... ]
| ...
Each row essentially represents a case of the variant. Each case has an associated tag
(also called a constructor, since you use it to construct a value) and may optionally
have a sequence of elds, where each eld has a specied type.
Let's consider a concrete example of how variants can be useful. Most UNIX-
like operating systems support terminals as a fundamental, text-based user interface.
Almost all of these terminals support a set of eight basic colors.
Those colors can be naturally represented as a variant. Each color is declared as a
simple tag, with pipes used to separate the dierent cases. Note that variant tags must
be capitalized.
open Base
open Stdio
type basic_color =
| Black | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue | Magenta | Cyan | White
As we show below, the variant tags introduced by the denition of basic_color can
be used for constructing values of that type.
# Cyan;;
- : basic_color = Cyan
# [Blue; Magenta; Red];;
- : basic_color list = [Blue; Magenta; Red]
The following function uses pattern matching to convert each of these to the corre-
sponding integer code that is used for communicating these colors to the terminal.
# let basic_color_to_int = function
| Black -> 0 | Red
-> 1 | Green -> 2 | Yellow -> 3
| Blue
-> 4 | Magenta -> 5 | Cyan
-> 6 | White
-> 7;;

100
Variants
val basic_color_to_int : basic_color -> int = <fun>
# List.map ~f:basic_color_to_int [Blue;Red];;
- : int list = [4; 1]
We know that the above function handles every color in basic_color because the
compiler would have warned us if we'd missed one:
# let incomplete_color_to_int = function
| Black -> 0 | Red -> 1 | White -> 7;;
Lines 1-2, characters 31-41:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
(Green|Yellow|Blue|Magenta|Cyan)
val incomplete_color_to_int : basic_color -> int = <fun>
In any case, using the correct function, we can generate escape codes to change the
color of a given string displayed in a terminal.
# let color_by_number number text =
Printf.sprintf "\027[38;5;%dm%s\027[0m" number text;;
val color_by_number : int -> string -> string = <fun>
# let blue = color_by_number (basic_color_to_int Blue) "Blue";;
val blue : string = "\027[38;5;4mBlue\027[0m"
# printf "Hello %s World!\n" blue;;
Hello Blue World!
- : unit = ()
On most terminals, that word Blue will be rendered in blue.
In this example, the cases of the variant are simple tags with no associated data. This
is substantively the same as the enumerations found in languages like C and Java. But
as we'll see, variants can do considerably more than represent simple enumerations.
As it happens, an enumeration isn't enough to eectively describe the full set of
colors that a modern terminal can display. Many terminals, including the venerable
xterm, support 256 dierent colors, broken up into the following groups:
• The eight basic colors, in regular and bold versions
• A 6 × 6 × 6 RGB color cube
• A 24-level grayscale ramp
We'll also represent this more complicated color space as a variant, but this time,
the dierent tags will have arguments that describe the data available in each case.
Note that variants can have multiple arguments, which are separated by *s.
type weight = Regular | Bold
type color =
| Basic of basic_color * weight (* basic colors, regular and bold *)
| RGB
of int * int * int
(* 6x6x6 color cube *)
| Gray
of int
(* 24 grayscale levels *)
As before, we can use these introduced tags to construct values of our newly dened
type.
# [RGB (250,70,70); Basic (Green, Regular)];;
- : color list = [RGB (250, 70, 70); Basic (Green, Regular)]

7.0 First-Class Fields
101
And again, we'll use pattern matching to convert a color to a corresponding integer.
In this case, the pattern matching does more than separate out the dierent cases; it
also allows us to extract the data associated with each tag:
# let color_to_int = function
| Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
let base = match weight with Bold -> 8 | Regular -> 0 in
base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
| RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
| Gray i -> 232 + i;;
val color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
Now, we can print text using the full set of available colors:
# let color_print color s =
printf "%s\n" (color_by_number (color_to_int color) s);;
val color_print : color -> string -> unit = <fun>
# color_print (Basic (Red,Bold)) "A bold red!";;
A bold red!
- : unit = ()
# color_print (Gray 4) "A muted gray...";;
A muted gray...
- : unit = ()
Variants, Tuples and Parens
Variants with multiple arguments look an awful lot like tuples. Consider the following
example of a value of the type color we dened earlier.
# RGB (200,0,200);;
- : color = RGB (200, 0, 200)
It really looks like we've created a 3-tuple and wrapped it with the RGB constructor.
But that's not what's really going on, as you can see if we create a tuple rst and then
place it inside the RGB constructor.
# let purple = (200,0,200);;
val purple : int * int * int = (200, 0, 200)
# RGB purple;;
Line 1, characters 1-11:
Error: The constructor RGB expects 3 argument(s),
but is applied here to 1 argument(s)
We can also create variants that explicitly contain tuples, like this one.
# type tupled = Tupled of (int * int);;
type tupled = Tupled of (int * int)
The syntactic dierence is unfortunately quite subtle, coming down to the extra set of
parens around the arguments. But having dened it this way, we can now take the tuple
in and out freely.
# let of_tuple x = Tupled x;;
val of_tuple : int * int -> tupled = <fun>
# let to_tuple (Tupled x) = x;;
val to_tuple : tupled -> int * int = <fun>

102
Variants
If, on the other hand, we dene a variant without the parens, then we get the same
behavior we got with the RGB constructor.
# type untupled = Untupled of int * int;;
type untupled = Untupled of int * int
# let of_tuple x = Untupled x;;
Line 1, characters 18-28:
Error: The constructor Untupled expects 2 argument(s),
but is applied here to 1 argument(s)
# let to_tuple (Untupled x) = x;;
Line 1, characters 14-26:
Error: The constructor Untupled expects 2 argument(s),
but is applied here to 1 argument(s)
Note that, while we can't just grab the tuple as a whole from this type, we can
achieve more or less the same ends by explicitly deconstructing and reconstructing the
data we need.
# let of_tuple (x,y) = Untupled (x,y);;
val of_tuple : int * int -> untupled = <fun>
# let to_tuple (Untupled (x,y)) = (x,y);;
val to_tuple : untupled -> int * int = <fun>
The dierences between a multi-argument variant and a variant containing a tuple
are mostly about performance. A multi-argument variant is a single allocated block in
memory, while a variant containing a tuple requires an extra heap-allocated block for
the tuple. You can learn more about OCaml's memory representation in Chapter 24
(Memory Representation of Values).
7.1
Catch-All Cases and Refactoring
OCaml's type system can act as a refactoring tool, warning you of places where your
code needs to be updated to match an interface change. This is particularly valuable in
the context of variants.
Consider what would happen if we were to change the denition of color to the
following:
type color =
| Basic of basic_color
(* basic colors *)
| Bold
of basic_color
(* bold basic colors *)
| RGB
of int * int * int (* 6x6x6 color cube *)
| Gray
of int
(* 24 grayscale levels *)
We've essentially broken out the Basic case into two cases, Basic and Bold, and
Basic has changed from having two arguments to one. color_to_int as we wrote it
still expects the old structure of the variant, and if we try to compile that same code
again, the compiler will notice the discrepancy:
# let color_to_int = function
| Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
let base = match weight with Bold -> 8 | Regular -> 0 in

7.1 Catch-All Cases and Refactoring
103
base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
| RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
| Gray i -> 232 + i;;
Line 2, characters 13-33:
Error: This pattern matches values of type 'a * 'b
but a pattern was expected which matches values of type
basic_color
Here, the compiler is complaining that the Basic tag is used with the wrong number
of arguments. If we x that, however, the compiler will ag a second problem, which
is that we haven't handled the new Bold tag:
# let color_to_int = function
| Basic basic_color -> basic_color_to_int basic_color
| RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
| Gray i -> 232 + i;;
Lines 1-4, characters 20-24:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
Bold _
val color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
Fixing this now leads us to the correct implementation:
# let color_to_int = function
| Basic basic_color -> basic_color_to_int basic_color
| Bold
basic_color -> 8 + basic_color_to_int basic_color
| RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
| Gray i -> 232 + i;;
val color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
As we've seen, the type errors identied the things that needed to be xed to
complete the refactoring of the code. This is fantastically useful, but for it to work
well and reliably, you need to write your code in a way that maximizes the compiler's
chances of helping you nd the bugs. To this end, a useful rule of thumb is to avoid
catch-all cases in pattern matches.
Here's an example that illustrates how catch-all cases interact with exhaustion
checks. Imagine we wanted a version of color_to_int that works on older terminals
by rendering the rst 16 colors (the eight basic_colors in regular and bold) in the
normal way, but renders everything else as white. We might have written the function
as follows.
# let oldschool_color_to_int = function
| Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
let base = match weight with Bold -> 8 | Regular -> 0 in
base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
| _ -> basic_color_to_int White;;
val oldschool_color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
If we then applied the same x we did above, we would have ended up with this.
# let oldschool_color_to_int = function
| Basic basic_color -> basic_color_to_int basic_color
| _ -> basic_color_to_int White;;
val oldschool_color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>

104
Variants
Because of the catch-all case, we'll no longer be warned about missing the Bold
case. That's why you should beware of catch-all cases: they suppress exhaustiveness
checking.
7.2
Combining Records and Variants
The term algebraic data types is often used to describe a collection of types that
includes variants, records, and tuples. Algebraic data types act as a peculiarly useful
and powerful language for describing data. At the heart of their utility is the fact
that they combine two dierent kinds of types: product types, like tuples and records,
which combine multiple dierent types together and are mathematically similar to
Cartesian products; and sum types, like variants, which let you combine multiple
dierent possibilities into one type, and are mathematically similar to disjoint unions.
Algebraic data types gain much of their power from the ability to construct lay-
ered combinations of sums and products. Let's see what we can achieve with this by
reiterating the Log_entry message type that was described in Chapter 6 (Records).
module Time_ns = Core.Time_ns
module Log_entry = struct
type t =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
important: bool;
message: string;
}
end
This record type combines multiple pieces of data into a single value. In particular, a
single Log_entry.t has a session_id and a time and an important ag and a message.
More generally, you can think of record types as conjunctions. Variants, on the other
hand, are disjunctions, letting you represent multiple possibilities. To construct an
example of where this is useful, we'll rst write out the other message types that came
along-side Log_entry.
module Heartbeat = struct
type t =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
status_message: string;
}
end
module Logon = struct
type t =
{ session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
user: string;
credentials: string;
}
end

7.2 Combining Records and Variants
105
A variant comes in handy when we want to represent values that could be any of
these three types. The client_message type below lets you do just that.
type client_message = | Logon of Logon.t
| Heartbeat of Heartbeat.t
| Log_entry of Log_entry.t
In particular, a client_message is a Logon or a Heartbeat or a Log_entry. If we
want to write code that processes messages generically, rather than code specialized to a
xed message type, we need something like client_message to act as one overarching
type for the dierent possible messages. We can then match on the client_message to
determine the type of the particular message being handled.
You can increase the precision of your types by using variants to represent dif-
ferences between dierent cases, and records to represent shared structure. Consider
the following function that takes a list of client_messages and returns all messages
generated by a given user. The code in question is implemented by folding over the list
of messages, where the accumulator is a pair of:
• The set of session identiers for the user that have been seen thus far
• The set of messages so far that are associated with the user
Here's the concrete code:
# let messages_for_user user messages =
let (user_messages,_) =
List.fold messages ~init:([], Set.empty (module String))
~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) message ->
match message with
| Logon m ->
if String.(m.user = user) then
(message::messages, Set.add user_sessions m.session_id)
else acc
| Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ ->
let session_id = match message with
| Logon
m -> m.session_id
| Heartbeat m -> m.session_id
| Log_entry m -> m.session_id
in
if Set.mem user_sessions session_id then
(message::messages,user_sessions)
else acc
)
in
List.rev user_messages;;
val messages_for_user : string -> client_message list ->
client_message list =
<fun>
We take advantage of the fact that the type of the record m is known in the above
code, so we don't have to qualify the record elds by the module they come from. e.g.,
we write m.user instead of m.Logon.user.
One annoyance of the above code is that the logic for determining the session ID is
somewhat repetitive, contemplating each of the possible message types (including the

106
Variants
Logon case, which isn't actually possible at that point in the code) and extracting the
session ID in each case. This per-message-type handling seems unnecessary, since the
session ID works the same way for all message types.
We can improve the code by refactoring our types to explicitly reect the information
that's shared between the dierent messages. The rst step is to cut down the denitions
of each per-message record to contain just the information unique to that record:
module Log_entry = struct
type t = { important: bool;
message: string;
}
end
module Heartbeat = struct
type t = { status_message: string; }
end
module Logon = struct
type t = { user: string;
credentials: string;
}
end
We can then dene a variant type that combines these types:
type details =
| Logon of Logon.t
| Heartbeat of Heartbeat.t
| Log_entry of Log_entry.t
Separately, we need a record that contains the elds that are common across all
messages:
module Common = struct
type t = { session_id: string;
time: Time_ns.t;
}
end
A full message can then be represented as a pair of a Common.t and a details. Using
this, we can rewrite our preceding example as follows. Note that we add extra type
annotations so that OCaml recognizes the record elds correctly. Otherwise, we'd need
to qualify them explicitly.
# let messages_for_user user (messages : (Common.t * details) list) =
let (user_messages,_) =
List.fold messages ~init:([],Set.empty (module String))
~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) ((common,details)
as message) ->
match details with
| Logon m ->
if String.(=) m.user user then
(message::messages, Set.add user_sessions
common.session_id)
else acc
| Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ ->
if Set.mem user_sessions common.session_id then
(message::messages, user_sessions)

7.2 Embedded Records
107
else acc
)
in
List.rev user_messages;;
val messages_for_user :
string -> (Common.t * details) list -> (Common.t * details) list =
<fun>
As you can see, the code for extracting the session ID has been replaced with the
simple expression common.session_id.
In addition, this design allows us to grab the specic message and dispatch code to
handle just that message type. In particular, while we use the type Common.t * details
to represent an arbitrary message, we can use Common.t * Logon.t to represent a logon
message. Thus, if we had functions for handling individual message types, we could
write a dispatch function as follows:
# let handle_message server_state ((common:Common.t), details) =
match details with
| Log_entry m -> handle_log_entry server_state (common,m)
| Logon
m -> handle_logon
server_state (common,m)
| Heartbeat m -> handle_heartbeat server_state (common,m);;
val handle_message : server_state -> Common.t * details -> unit =
<fun>
And it's explicit at the type level that handle_log_entry sees only Log_entry
messages, handle_logon sees only Logon messages, etc.
7.2.1
Embedded Records
If we don't need to be able to pass the record types separately from the variant, then
OCaml allows us to embed the records directly into the variant.
type details =
| Logon
of { user: string; credentials: string; }
| Heartbeat of { status_message: string; }
| Log_entry of { important: bool; message: string; }
Even though the type is dierent, we can write messages_for_user in essentially
the same way we did before.
# let messages_for_user user (messages : (Common.t * details) list) =
let (user_messages,_) =
List.fold messages ~init:([],Set.empty (module String))
~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) ((common,details)
as message) ->
match details with
| Logon m ->
if String.(=) m.user user then
(message::messages, Set.add user_sessions
common.session_id)
else acc
| Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ ->
if Set.mem user_sessions common.session_id then
(message::messages, user_sessions)

108
Variants
else acc
)
in
List.rev user_messages;;
val messages_for_user :
string -> (Common.t * details) list -> (Common.t * details) list =
<fun>
Variants with inline records are both more concise and more ecient than having
variants containing references to free-standing record types, because they don't require
a separate allocated object for the contents of the variant.
The main downside is the obvious one, which is that an inline record can't be treated
as its own free-standing object. And, as you can see below, OCaml will reject code that
tries to do so.
# let get_logon_contents = function
| Logon m -> Some m
| _ -> None;;
Line 2, characters 23-24:
Error: This form is not allowed as the type of the inlined record
could escape.
7.3
Variants and Recursive Data Structures
Another common application of variants is to represent tree-like recursive data struc-
tures. We'll show how this can be done by walking through the design of a simple
Boolean expression language. Such a language can be useful anywhere you need to
specify lters, which are used in everything from packet analyzers to mail clients.
An expression in this language will be dened by the variant expr, with one tag for
each kind of expression we want to support:
type 'a expr =
| Base
of 'a
| Const of bool
| And
of 'a expr list
| Or
of 'a expr list
| Not
of 'a expr
Note that the denition of the type expr is recursive, meaning that an expr may
contain other exprs. Also, expr is parameterized by a polymorphic type 'a which is
used for specifying the type of the value that goes under the Base tag.
The purpose of each tag is pretty straightforward. And, Or, and Not are the basic
operators for building up Boolean expressions, and Const lets you enter the constants
true and false.
The Base tag is what allows you to tie the expr to your application, by letting you
specify an element of some base predicate type, whose truth or falsehood is determined
by your application. If you were writing a lter language for an email processor, your
base predicates might specify the tests you would run against an email, as in the
following example:

7.3 Variants and Recursive Data Structures
109
type mail_field = To | From | CC | Date | Subject
type mail_predicate = { field: mail_field;
contains: string }
Using the preceding code, we can construct a simple expression with mail_predicate
as its base predicate:
# let test field contains = Base { field; contains };;
val test : mail_field -> string -> mail_predicate expr = <fun>
# And [ Or [ test To "doligez"; test CC "doligez" ];
test Subject "runtime";
];;
- : mail_predicate expr =
And
[Or
[Base {field = To; contains = "doligez"};
Base {field = CC; contains = "doligez"}];
Base {field = Subject; contains = "runtime"}]
Being able to construct such expressions isn't enough; we also need to be able to
evaluate them. Here's a function for doing just that:
# let rec eval expr base_eval =
(* a shortcut, so we don't need to repeatedly pass [base_eval]
explicitly to [eval] *)
let eval' expr = eval expr base_eval in
match expr with
| Base
base
-> base_eval base
| Const bool
-> bool
| And
exprs -> List.for_all exprs ~f:eval'
| Or
exprs -> List.exists
exprs ~f:eval'
| Not
expr
-> not (eval' expr);;
val eval : 'a expr -> ('a -> bool) -> bool = <fun>
The structure of the code is pretty straightforwardwe're just pattern matching
over the structure of the data, doing the appropriate calculation based on which tag we
see. To use this evaluator on a concrete example, we just need to write the base_eval
function, which is capable of evaluating a base predicate.
Another useful operation on expressions is simplication, which is the process of
taking a boolean expression and reducing it to an equivalent one that is smaller. First,
we'll build a few simplifying construction functions that mirror the tags of an expr.
The and_ function below does a few things:
• Reduces the entire expression to the constant false if any of the arms of the And are
themselves false.
• Drops any arms of the And that there the constant true.
• Drops the And if it only has one arm.
• If the And has no arms, then reduces it to Const true.
The code is below.
# let and_ l =
if List.exists l ~f:(function Const false -> true | _ -> false)
then Const false

110
Variants
else
match List.filter l ~f:(function Const true -> false | _ ->
true) with
| [] -> Const true
| [ x ] -> x
| l -> And l;;
val and_ : 'a expr list -> 'a expr = <fun>
Or is the dual of And, and as you can see, the code for or_ follows a similar pattern
as that for and_, mostly reversing the role of true and false.
# let or_ l =
if List.exists l ~f:(function Const true -> true | _ -> false)
then Const true
else
match List.filter l ~f:(function Const false -> false | _ ->
true) with
| [] -> Const false
| [x] -> x
| l -> Or l;;
val or_ : 'a expr list -> 'a expr = <fun>
Finally, not_ just has special handling for constants, applying the ordinary boolean
negation function to them.
# let not_ = function
| Const b -> Const (not b)
| e -> Not e;;
val not_ : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
We can now write a simplication routine that is based on the preceding functions.
Note that this function is recursive, in that it applies all of these simplications in a
bottom-up way across the entire expression.
# let rec simplify = function
| Base _ | Const _ as x -> x
| And l -> and_ (List.map ~f:simplify l)
| Or l
-> or_
(List.map ~f:simplify l)
| Not e -> not_ (simplify e);;
val simplify : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
We can now apply this to a Boolean expression and see how good a job it does at
simplifying it.
# simplify (Not (And [ Or [Base "it's snowing"; Const true];
Base "it's raining"]));;
- : string expr = Not (Base "it's raining")
Here, it correctly converted the Or branch to Const true and then eliminated the And
entirely, since the And then had only one nontrivial component.
There are some simplications it misses, however. In particular, see what happens
if we add a double negation in.
# simplify (Not (And [ Or [Base "it's snowing"; Const true];
Not (Not (Base "it's raining"))]));;
- : string expr = Not (Not (Not (Base "it's raining")))

7.4 Polymorphic Variants
111
It fails to remove the double negation, and it's easy to see why. The not_ function
has a catch-all case, so it ignores everything but the one case it explicitly considers,
that of the negation of a constant. Catch-all cases are generally a bad idea, and if we
make the code more explicit, we see that the missing of the double negation is more
obvious:
# let not_ = function
| Const b -> Const (not b)
| (Base _ | And _ | Or _ | Not _) as e -> Not e;;
val not_ : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
We can of course x this by simply adding an explicit case for double negation:
# let not_ = function
| Const b -> Const (not b)
| Not e -> e
| (Base _ | And _ | Or _ ) as e -> Not e;;
val not_ : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
The example of a Boolean expression language is more than a toy. There's a module
very much in this spirit in Core called Blang (short for Boolean language), and it
gets a lot of practical use in a variety of applications. The simplication algorithm in
particular is useful when you want to use it to specialize the evaluation of expressions
for which the evaluation of some of the base predicates is already known.
More generally, using variants to build recursive data structures is a common tech-
nique, and shows up everywhere from designing little languages to building complex
data structures.
7.4
Polymorphic Variants
In addition to the ordinary variants we've seen so far, OCaml also supports so-called
polymorphic variants. As we'll see, polymorphic variants are more exible and syn-
tactically more lightweight than ordinary variants, but that extra power comes at a cost.
Syntactically, polymorphic variants are distinguished from ordinary variants by the
leading backtick. And unlike ordinary variants, polymorphic variants can be used
without an explicit type declaration:
# let three = `Int 3;;
val three : [> `Int of int ] = `Int 3
# let four = `Float 4.;;
val four : [> `Float of float ] = `Float 4.
# let nan = `Not_a_number;;
val nan : [> `Not_a_number ] = `Not_a_number
# [three; four; nan];;
- : [> `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number ] list =
[`Int 3; `Float 4.; `Not_a_number]
As you can see, polymorphic variant types are inferred automatically, and when we
combine variants with dierent tags, the compiler infers a new type that knows about

112
Variants
all of those tags. Note that in the preceding example, the tag name (e.g., `Int) matches
the type name (int). This is a common convention in OCaml.
The type system will complain if it sees incompatible uses of the same tag:
# let five = `Int "five";;
val five : [> `Int of string ] = `Int "five"
# [three; four; five];;
Line 1, characters 15-19:
Error: This expression has type [> `Int of string ]
but an expression was expected of type
[> `Float of float | `Int of int ]
Types for tag `Int are incompatible
The > at the beginning of the variant types above is critical because it marks the
types as being open to combination with other variant types. We can read the type [>
`Float of float | `Int of int] as describing a variant whose tags include `Float
of float and `Int of int, but may include more tags as well. In other words, you
can roughly translate > to mean: these tags or more.
OCaml will in some cases infer a variant type with <, to indicate these tags or less,
as in the following example:
# let is_positive = function
| `Int
x -> x > 0
| `Float x -> Float.(x > 0.);;
val is_positive : [< `Float of float | `Int of int ] -> bool = <fun>
The < is there because is_positive has no way of dealing with values that have tags
other than `Float of float or `Int of int, but can handle types that have either or
both of those two tags.
We can think of these < and > markers as indications of upper and lower bounds on
the tags involved. If the same set of tags are both an upper and a lower bound, we end
up with an exact polymorphic variant type, which has neither marker. For example:
# let exact = List.filter ~f:is_positive [three;four];;
val exact : [ `Float of float | `Int of int ] list = [`Int 3; `Float
4.]
Perhaps surprisingly, we can also create polymorphic variant types that have distinct
upper and lower bounds. Note that Ok and Error in the following example come from
the Result.t type from Base.
# let is_positive = function
| `Int
x -> Ok (x > 0)
| `Float x -> Ok Float.O.(x > 0.)
| `Not_a_number -> Error "not a number";;
val is_positive :
[< `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number ] -> (bool, string)
result =
<fun>
# List.filter [three; four] ~f:(fun x ->
match is_positive x with Error _ -> false | Ok b -> b);;
- : [< `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number > `Float `Int ]
list =
[`Int 3; `Float 4.]

7.4 Example: Terminal Colors Redux
113
Here, the inferred type states that the tags can be no more than `Float, `Int, and
`Not_a_number, and must contain at least `Float and `Int. As you can already start
to see, polymorphic variants can lead to fairly complex inferred types.
Polymorphic Variants and Catch-All Cases
As we saw with the denition of is_positive, a match expression can lead to the
inference of an upper bound on a variant type, limiting the possible tags to those that
can be handled by the match. If we add a catch-all case to our match expression, we
end up with a type with a lower bound.
# let is_positive_permissive = function
| `Int
x -> Ok Int.(x > 0)
| `Float x -> Ok Float.(x > 0.)
| _ -> Error "Unknown number type";;
val is_positive_permissive :
[> `Float of float | `Int of int ] -> (bool, string) result = <fun>
# is_positive_permissive (`Int 0);;
- : (bool, string) result = Ok false
# is_positive_permissive (`Ratio (3,4));;
- : (bool, string) result = Error "Unknown number type"
Catch-all cases are error-prone even with ordinary variants, but they are especially
so with polymorphic variants. That's because you have no way of bounding what tags
your function might have to deal with. Such code is particularly vulnerable to typos.
For instance, if code that uses is_positive_permissive passes in Float misspelled
as Floot, the erroneous code will compile without complaint.
# is_positive_permissive (`Floot 3.5);;
- : (bool, string) result = Error "Unknown number type"
With ordinary variants, such a typo would have been caught as an unknown tag. As
a general matter, one should be wary about mixing catch-all cases and polymorphic
variants.
7.4.1
Example: Terminal Colors Redux
To see how to use polymorphic variants in practice, we'll return to terminal colors.
Imagine that we have a new terminal type that adds yet more colors, say, by adding an
alpha channel so you can specify translucent colors. We could model this extended set
of colors as follows, using an ordinary variant:
type extended_color =
| Basic of basic_color * weight
(* basic colors, regular and bold
*)
| RGB
of int * int * int
(* 6x6x6 color space *)
| Gray
of int
(* 24 grayscale levels *)
| RGBA
of int * int * int * int (* 6x6x6x6 color space *)
We want to write a function extended_color_to_int that works like color_to_int
for all of the old kinds of colors, with new logic only for handling colors that include
an alpha channel. One might try to write such a function as follows.

114
Variants
# let extended_color_to_int = function
| RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
| (Basic _ | RGB _ | Gray _) as color -> color_to_int color;;
Line 3, characters 59-64:
Error: This expression has type extended_color
but an expression was expected of type color
The code looks reasonable enough, but it leads to a type error because
extended_color and color are in the compiler's view distinct and unrelated types.
The compiler doesn't, for example, recognize any equality between the Basic tag in
the two types.
What we want to do is to share tags between two dierent variant types, and poly-
morphic variants let us do this in a natural way. First, let's rewrite basic_color_to_int
and color_to_int using polymorphic variants. The translation here is pretty straight-
forward:
# let basic_color_to_int = function
| `Black -> 0 | `Red
-> 1 | `Green -> 2 | `Yellow -> 3
| `Blue
-> 4 | `Magenta -> 5 | `Cyan
-> 6 | `White
-> 7;;
val basic_color_to_int :
[< `Black | `Blue | `Cyan | `Green | `Magenta | `Red | `White |
`Yellow ] ->
int = <fun>
# let color_to_int = function
| `Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
let base = match weight with `Bold -> 8 | `Regular -> 0 in
base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
| `RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
| `Gray i -> 232 + i;;
val color_to_int :
[< `Basic of
[< `Black
| `Blue
| `Cyan
| `Green
| `Magenta
| `Red
| `White
| `Yellow ] *
[< `Bold | `Regular ]
| `Gray of int
| `RGB of int * int * int ] ->
int = <fun>
Now we can try writing extended_color_to_int. The key issue with this code is
that extended_color_to_int needs to invoke color_to_int with a narrower type, i.e.,
one that includes fewer tags. Written properly, this narrowing can be done via a pattern
match. In particular, in the following code, the type of the variable color includes only
the tags `Basic, `RGB, and `Gray, and not `RGBA:
# let extended_color_to_int = function
| `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
| (`Basic _ | `RGB _ | `Gray _) as color -> color_to_int color;;
val extended_color_to_int :
[< `Basic of

7.4 Example: Terminal Colors Redux
115
[< `Black
| `Blue
| `Cyan
| `Green
| `Magenta
| `Red
| `White
| `Yellow ] *
[< `Bold | `Regular ]
| `Gray of int
| `RGB of int * int * int
| `RGBA of int * int * int * int ] ->
int = <fun>
The preceding code is more delicately balanced than one might imagine. In partic-
ular, if we use a catch-all case instead of an explicit enumeration of the cases, the type
is no longer narrowed, and so compilation fails:
# let extended_color_to_int = function
| `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
| color -> color_to_int color;;
Line 3, characters 29-34:
Error: This expression has type [> `RGBA of int * int * int * int ]
but an expression was expected of type
[< `Basic of
[< `Black
| `Blue
| `Cyan
| `Green
| `Magenta
| `Red
| `White
| `Yellow ] *
[< `Bold | `Regular ]
| `Gray of int
| `RGB of int * int * int ]
The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `RGBA
Let's consider how we might turn our code into a proper library with an implemen-
tation in an ml le and an interface in a separate mli, as we saw in Chapter 5 (Files,
Modules, and Programs). Let's start with the mli.
open Base
type basic_color =
[ `Black
| `Blue | `Cyan
| `Green
| `Magenta | `Red
| `White | `Yellow ]
type color =
[ `Basic of basic_color * [ `Bold | `Regular ]
| `Gray of int
| `RGB

type extended_color =
[ color
| `RGBA of int * int * int * int ]

116
Variants
val color_to_int
: color -> int
val extended_color_to_int : extended_color -> int
Here, extended_color is dened as an explicit extension of color. Also, notice
that we dened all of these types as exact variants. We can implement this library as
follows.
open Base

the

of
extended_color_to_int that highlights some of the downsides of polymorphic vari-
ants. In particular, we added some special-case handling for the color gray, rather than
using color_to_int. Unfortunately, we misspelled Gray as Grey. This is exactly the
kind of error that the compiler would catch with ordinary variants, but with polymor-
phic variants, this compiles without issue. All that happened was that the compiler
inferred a wider type for extended_color_to_int, which happens to be compatible
with the narrower type that was listed in the mli. As a result, this library builds without
error.
$ dune build @all
If we add an explicit type annotation to the code itself (rather than just in the mli),
then the compiler has enough information to warn us:
let extended_color_to_int : extended_color -> int = function
| `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216

7.4 When to Use Polymorphic Variants

| (`Basic _ | `RGB _ | `Gray _) as color -> color_to_int color
In particular, the compiler will complain that the `Grey case is unused:
$ dune build @all

30 |
| `Grey x -> 2000 + x
^^^^^^^
Error: This pattern matches values of type [? `Grey of 'a ]
but a pattern was expected which matches values of type
extended_color
The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `Grey
[1]
Once we have type denitions at our disposal, we can revisit the question of how
we write the pattern match that narrows the type. In particular, we can explicitly use
the type name as part of the pattern match, by prexing it with a #:
let extended_color_to_int : extended_color -> int = function
| `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
| #color as color -> color_to_int color
This is useful when you want to narrow down to a type whose denition is long,
and you don't want the verbosity of writing the tags down explicitly in the match.
7.4.2
When to Use Polymorphic Variants
At rst glance, polymorphic variants look like a strict improvement over ordinary
variants. You can do everything that ordinary variants can do, plus it's more exible
and more concise. What's not to like?
In reality, regular variants are the more pragmatic choice most of the time. That's
because the exibility of polymorphic variants comes at a price. Here are some of the
downsides:
Complexity The typing rules for polymorphic variants are a lot more complicated
than they are for regular variants. This means that heavy use of polymorphic
variants can leave you scratching your head trying to gure out why a given
piece of code did or didn't compile. It can also lead to absurdly long and
hard to decode error messages. Indeed, concision at the value level is often
balanced out by more verbosity at the type level.
Error-nding Polymorphic variants are type-safe, but the typing discipline that they
impose is, by dint of its exibility, less likely to catch bugs in your program.
Eciency This isn't a huge eect, but polymorphic variants are somewhat heavier than
regular variants, and OCaml can't generate code for matching on polymorphic
variants that is quite as ecient as what it generated for regular variants.
All that said, polymorphic variants are still a useful and powerful feature, but it's
worth understanding their limitations and how to use them sensibly and modestly.
Probably the safest and most common use case for polymorphic variants is where

118
Variants
ordinary variants would be sucient but are syntactically too heavyweight. For exam-
ple, you often want to create a variant type for encoding the inputs or outputs to a
function, where it's not worth declaring a separate type for it. Polymorphic variants
are very useful here, and as long as there are type annotations that constrain these to
have explicit, exact types, this tends to work well.
Variants are most problematic exactly where you take full advantage of their power;
in particular, when you take advantage of the ability of polymorphic variant types to
overlap in the tags they support. This ties into OCaml's support for subtyping. As we'll
discuss further when we cover objects in Chapter 13 (Objects), subtyping brings in a
lot of complexity, and most of the time, that's complexity you want to avoid.

Error Handling
Nobody likes dealing with errors. It's tedious, it's easy to get wrong, and it's usually
just not as fun as thinking about how your program is going to succeed. But error
handling is important, and however much you don't like thinking about it, having your
software fail due to poor error handling is worse.
Thankfully, OCaml has powerful tools for handling errors reliably and with a mini-
mum of pain. In this chapter we'll discuss some of the dierent approaches in OCaml
to handling errors, and give some advice on how to design interfaces that make error
handling easier.
We'll start by describing the two basic approaches for reporting errors in OCaml:
error-aware return types and exceptions.
8.1
Error-Aware Return Types
The best way in OCaml to signal an error is to include that error in your return value.
Consider the type of the find function in the List module:
# open Base;;
# List.find;;
- : 'a list -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a option = <fun>
The option in the return type indicates that the function may not succeed in nding
a suitable element:
# List.find [1;2;3] ~f:(fun x -> x >= 2);;
- : int option = Some 2
# List.find [1;2;3] ~f:(fun x -> x >= 10);;
- : int option = None
Including errors in the return values of your functions requires the caller to handle
the error explicitly, allowing the caller to make the choice of whether to recover from
the error or propagate it onward.
Consider the compute_bounds function below, which takes a list and a comparison
function and returns upper and lower bounds for the list by nding the smallest and
largest element on the list. List.hd and List.last, which return None when they
encounter an empty list, are used to extract the largest and smallest element of the list:
# let compute_bounds ~compare list =
let sorted = List.sort ~compare list in

120
Error Handling
match List.hd sorted, List.last sorted with
| None,_ | _, None -> None
| Some x, Some y -> Some (x,y);;
val compute_bounds : compare:('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> ('a * 'a)
option =
<fun>
The match expression is used to handle the error cases, propagating a None in hd or
last into the return value of compute_bounds.
On the other hand, in the find_mismatches that follows, errors encountered during
the computation do not propagate to the return value of the function. find_mismatches
takes two hash tables as arguments and searches for keys that have dierent data in one
table than in the other. As such, the failure to nd a key in one table isn't a failure of
any sort:
# let find_mismatches table1 table2 =
Hashtbl.fold table1 ~init:[] ~f:(fun ~key ~data mismatches ->
match Hashtbl.find table2 key with
| Some data' when data' <> data -> key :: mismatches
| _ -> mismatches
);;
val find_mismatches :
('a, int) Hashtbl.Poly.t -> ('a, int) Hashtbl.Poly.t -> 'a list =
<fun>
The use of options to encode errors underlines the fact that it's not clear whether a
particular outcome, like not nding something on a list, is an error or is just another
valid outcome. This depends on the larger context of your program, and thus is not
something that a general-purpose library can know in advance. One of the advantages
of error-aware return types is that they work well in both situations.
8.1.1
Encoding Errors with Result
Options aren't always a suciently expressive way to report errors. Specically, when
you encode an error as None, there's nowhere to say anything about the nature of the
error.
Result.t is meant to address this deciency. The type is dened as follows:
module Result : sig
type ('a,'b) t = | Ok of 'a
| Error of 'b
end
A Result.t is essentially an option augmented with the ability to store other infor-
mation in the error case. Like Some and None for options, the constructors Ok and Error
are available at the toplevel. As such, we can write:
# [ Ok 3; Error "abject failure"; Ok 4 ];;
- : (int, string) result list = [Ok 3; Error "abject failure"; Ok 4]
without rst opening the Result module.

8.1 Error and Or_error
121
8.1.2
Error and Or_error
Result.t gives you complete freedom to choose the type of value you use to represent
errors, but it's often useful to standardize on an error type. Among other things, this
makes it easier to write utility functions to automate common error handling patterns.
But which type to choose? Is it better to represent errors as strings? Some more
structured representation like XML? Or something else entirely?
Base's answer to this question is the Error.t type. You can, for example, construct
one from a string.
# Error.of_string "something went wrong";;
- : Error.t = something went wrong
An Or_error.t is simply a Result.t with the error case specialized to the Error.t
type. Here's an example.
# Error (Error.of_string "failed!");;
- : ('a, Error.t) result = Error failed!
The Or_error module provides a bunch of useful operators for constructing er-
rors. For example, Or_error.try_with can be used for catching exceptions from a
computation.
# let float_of_string s =
Or_error.try_with (fun () -> Float.of_string s);;
val float_of_string : string -> float Or_error.t = <fun>
# float_of_string "3.34";;
- : float Or_error.t = Base__.Result.Ok 3.34
# float_of_string "a.bc";;
- : float Or_error.t =
Base__.Result.Error (Invalid_argument "Float.of_string a.bc")
Perhaps the most common way to create Error.ts is using s-expressions. An s-
expression is a balanced parenthetical expression where the leaves of the expressions
are strings. Here's a simple example:
(This (is an) (s expression))
S-expressions are supported by the Sexplib package that is distributed with Base
and is the most common serialization format used in Base. Indeed, most types in Base
come with built-in s-expression converters.
# Error.create "Unexpected character" 'c' Char.sexp_of_t;;
- : Error.t = ("Unexpected character" c)
We're not restricted to doing this kind of error reporting with built-in types. As we'll
discuss in more detail in Chapter 21 (Data Serialization with S-Expressions), Sexplib
comes with a syntax extension that can autogenerate sexp converters for specic types.
We can enable it in the toplevel with a #require statement enabling ppx_jane, which is
a package that pulls in multiple dierent syntax extensions, including ppx_sexp_value,
the one we need here. (Because of technical issues with the toplevel, we can't easily
enable these syntax extensions individually.)
# #require "ppx_jane";;

122
Error Handling
# Error.t_of_sexp
[%sexp ("List is too long",[1;2;3] : string * int list)];;
- : Error.t = ("List is too long" (1 2 3))
Error also supports operations for transforming errors. For example, it's often useful
to augment an error with information about the context of the error or to combine
multiple errors together. Error.tag and Error.of_list fulll these roles:
# Error.tag
(Error.of_list [ Error.of_string "Your tires were slashed";
Error.of_string "Your windshield was smashed" ])
~tag:"over the weekend";;
- : Error.t =
("over the weekend" "Your tires were slashed" "Your windshield was
smashed")
A very common way of generating errors is the %message syntax extension, which
provides a compact syntax for providing a string describing the error, along with further
values represented as s-expressions. Here's an example.
# let a = "foo" and b = ("foo",[3;4]);;
val a : string = "foo"
val b : string * int list = ("foo", [3; 4])
# Or_error.error_s
[%message "Something went wrong" (a:string) (b: string * int
list)];;
- : 'a Or_error.t =
Base__.Result.Error ("Something went wrong" (a foo) (b (foo (3 4))))
This is the most common idiom for generating Error.t's.
8.1.3
bind and Other Error Handling Idioms
As you write more error handling code in OCaml, you'll discover that certain patterns
start to emerge. A number of these common patterns have been codied by functions
in modules like Option and Result. One particularly useful pattern is built around the
function bind, which is both an ordinary function and an inx operator >>=. Here's the
denition of bind for options:
# let bind option ~f =
match option with
| None -> None
| Some x -> f x;;
val bind : 'a option -> f:('a -> 'b option) -> 'b option = <fun>
As you can see, bind None f returns None without calling f, and bind (Some x)
~f returns f x. bind can be used as a way of sequencing together error-producing
functions so that the rst one to produce an error terminates the computation. Here's
a rewrite of compute_bounds to use a nested series of binds:
# let compute_bounds ~compare list =
let sorted = List.sort ~compare list in
Option.bind (List.hd sorted) ~f:(fun first ->
Option.bind (List.last sorted) ~f:(fun last ->

8.1 bind and Other Error Handling Idioms
123
Some (first,last)));;
val compute_bounds : compare:('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> ('a * 'a)
option =
<fun>
The preceding code is a little bit hard to swallow, however, on a syntactic level. We
can make it easier to read and drop some of the parentheses, by using the inx operator
form of bind, which we get access to by locally opening Option.Monad_infix. The
module is called Monad_infix because the bind operator is part of a subinterface called
Monad, which we'll see again in Chapter 17 (Concurrent Programming with Async).
# let compute_bounds ~compare list =
let open Option.Monad_infix in
let sorted = List.sort ~compare list in
List.hd sorted
>>= fun first ->
List.last sorted >>= fun last
->
Some (first,last);;
val compute_bounds : compare:('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> ('a * 'a)
option =
<fun>
This use of bind isn't really materially better than the one we started with, and
indeed, for small examples like this, direct matching of options is generally better than
using bind. But for large, complex examples with many stages of error handling, the
bind idiom becomes clearer and easier to manage.
Monads and Let_syntax
We can make this look a little bit more ordinary by using a syntax extension that's
designed specically for monadic binds, called Let_syntax. Here's what the above
example looks like using this extension.
# #require "ppx_let";;
# let compute_bounds ~compare list =
let open Option.Let_syntax in
let sorted = List.sort ~compare list in
let%bind first = List.hd sorted in
let%bind last
= List.last sorted in
Some (first,last);;
val compute_bounds : compare:('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> ('a * 'a)
option =
<fun>
Note that we needed a #require statement to enable the extension.
To understand what's going on here, you need to know that
let%bind
x = some_expr in some_other_expr is rewritten into some_expr >>= fun x ->
some_other_expr.
The advantage of Let_syntax is that it makes monadic bind look more like a regular
let-binding. This works nicely because you can think of the monadic bind in this case
as a special form of let binding that has some built-in error handling semantics.
There are other useful idioms encoded in the functions in Option. One example
is Option.both, which takes two optional values and produces a new optional pair

124
Error Handling
that is None if either of its arguments are None. Using Option.both, we can make
compute_bounds even shorter:
# let compute_bounds ~compare list =
let sorted = List.sort ~compare list in
Option.both (List.hd sorted) (List.last sorted);;
val compute_bounds : compare:('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> ('a * 'a)
option =
<fun>
These error-handling functions are valuable because they let you express your error
handling both explicitly and concisely. We've only discussed these functions in the
context of the Option module, but more functionality of this kind can be found in the
Result and Or_error modules.
8.2
Exceptions
Exceptions in OCaml are not that dierent from exceptions in many other languages,
like Java, C#, and Python. Exceptions are a way to terminate a computation and report
an error, while providing a mechanism to catch and handle (and possibly recover from)
exceptions that are triggered by subcomputations.
You can trigger an exception by, for example, dividing an integer by zero:
# 3 / 0;;
Exception: Division_by_zero.
And an exception can terminate a computation even if it happens nested somewhere
deep within it:
# List.map ~f:(fun x -> 100 / x) [1;3;0;4];;
Exception: Division_by_zero.
If we put a printf in the middle of the computation, we can see that List.map is
interrupted partway through its execution, never getting to the end of the list:
# List.map ~f:(fun x -> Stdio.printf "%d\n%!" x; 100 / x) [1;3;0;4];;
1
3
0
Exception: Division_by_zero.
In addition to built-in exceptions like Divide_by_zero, OCaml lets you dene your
own:
# exception Key_not_found of string;;
exception Key_not_found of string
# raise (Key_not_found "a");;
Exception: Key_not_found("a").
Exceptions are ordinary values and can be manipulated just like other OCaml values:
# let exceptions = [ Division_by_zero; Key_not_found "b" ];;
val exceptions : exn list = [Division_by_zero; Key_not_found("b")]
# List.filter exceptions
~f:(function

8.2 Exceptions
125
| Key_not_found _ -> true
| _ -> false);;
- : exn list = [Key_not_found("b")]
Exceptions are all of the same type, exn, which is itself something of a special case
in the OCaml type system. It is similar to the variant types we encountered in Chapter 7
(Variants), except that it is open, meaning that it's not fully dened in any one place. In
particular, new tags (specically, new exceptions) can be added to it by dierent parts
of the program. This is in contrast to ordinary variants, which are dened with a closed
universe of available tags. One result of this is that you can never have an exhaustive
match on an exn, since the full set of possible exceptions is not known.
The following function uses the Key_not_found exception we dened above to signal
an error:
# let rec find_exn alist key = match alist with
| [] -> raise (Key_not_found key)
| (key',data) :: tl -> if String.(=) key key' then data else
find_exn tl key;;
val find_exn : (string * 'a) list -> string -> 'a = <fun>
# let alist = [("a",1); ("b",2)];;
val alist : (string * int) list = [("a", 1); ("b", 2)]
# find_exn alist "a";;
- : int = 1
# find_exn alist "c";;
Exception: Key_not_found("c").
Note that we named the function find_exn to warn the user that the function routinely
throws exceptions, a convention that is used heavily in Base.
In the preceding example, raise throws the exception, thus terminating the compu-
tation. The type of raise is a bit surprising when you rst see it: [raise}{.idx}
# raise;;
- : exn -> 'a = <fun>
The return type of 'a makes it look like raise manufactures a value to return that
is completely unconstrained in its type. That seems impossible, and it is. Really, raise
has a return type of 'a because it never returns at all. This behavior isn't restricted to
functions like raise that terminate by throwing exceptions. Here's another example of
a function that doesn't return a value:
# let rec forever () = forever ();;
val forever : unit -> 'a = <fun>
forever doesn't return a value for a dierent reason: it's an innite loop.
This all matters because it means that the return type of raise can be whatever it
needs to be to t into the context it is called in. Thus, the type system will let us throw
an exception anywhere in a program.
Declaring Exceptions Using [@@deriving sexp]
OCaml can't always generate a useful textual representation of an exception. For
example:
# type 'a bounds = { lower: 'a; upper: 'a };;

126
Error Handling
type 'a bounds = { lower : 'a; upper : 'a; }
# exception Crossed_bounds of int bounds;;
exception Crossed_bounds of int bounds
# Crossed_bounds { lower=10; upper=0 };;
- : exn = Crossed_bounds(_)
But if we declare the exception (and the types it depends on) using [@@deriving sexp],
we'll get something with more information:
# type 'a bounds = { lower: 'a; upper: 'a } [@@deriving sexp];;
type 'a bounds = { lower : 'a; upper : 'a; }
val bounds_of_sexp : (Sexp.t -> 'a) -> Sexp.t -> 'a bounds = <fun>
val sexp_of_bounds : ('a -> Sexp.t) -> 'a bounds -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# exception Crossed_bounds of int bounds [@@deriving sexp];;
exception Crossed_bounds of int bounds
# Crossed_bounds { lower=10; upper=0 };;
- : exn = (//toplevel//.Crossed_bounds ((lower 10) (upper 0)))
The period in front of Crossed_bounds is there because the representation generated
by [@@deriving sexp] includes the full module path of the module where the exception
in question is dened. In this case, the string //toplevel// is used to indicate that this
was declared at the utop prompt, rather than in a module.
This is all part of the support for s-expressions provided by the Sexplib library and
syntax extension, which is described in more detail in Chapter 21 (Data Serialization
with S-Expressions).
8.2.1
Helper Functions for Throwing Exceptions
Base provides a number of helper functions to simplify the task of throwing exceptions.
The simplest one is failwith, which could be dened as follows:
# let failwith msg = raise (Failure msg);;
val failwith : string -> 'a = <fun>
There are several other useful functions for raising exceptions, which can be found
in the API documentation for the Common and Exn modules in Base.
Another important way of throwing an exception is the assert directive. assert
is used for situations where a violation of the condition in question indicates a bug.
Consider the following piece of code for zipping together two lists:
# let merge_lists xs ys ~f =
if List.length xs <> List.length ys then None
else
let rec loop xs ys =
match xs,ys with
| [],[] -> []
| x::xs, y::ys -> f x y :: loop xs ys
| _ -> assert false
in
Some (loop xs ys);;
val merge_lists : 'a list -> 'b list -> f:('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c list
option =

8.2 Cleaning Up in the Presence of Exceptions
127
<fun>
# merge_lists [1;2;3] [-1;1;2] ~f:(+);;
- : int list option = Some [0; 3; 5]
# merge_lists [1;2;3] [-1;1] ~f:(+);;
- : int list option = None
Here we use assert false, which means that the assert, once reached, is guaranteed
to trigger. In general, one can put an arbitrary condition in the assertion.
In this case, the assert can never be triggered because we have a check that makes
sure that the lists are of the same length before we call loop. If we change the code so
that we drop this test, then we can trigger the assert:
# let merge_lists xs ys ~f =
let rec loop xs ys =
match xs,ys with
| [],[] -> []
| x::xs, y::ys -> f x y :: loop xs ys
| _ -> assert false
in
loop xs ys;;
val merge_lists : 'a list -> 'b list -> f:('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c list =
<fun>
# merge_lists [1;2;3] [-1] ~f:(+);;
Exception: "Assert_failure //toplevel//:6:14"
This shows what's special about assert: it captures the line number and character
oset of the source location from which the assertion was made.
8.2.2
Exception Handlers
So far, we've only seen exceptions fully terminate the execution of a computation. But
sometimes, we want a program to be able to respond to and recover from an exception.
This is achieved through the use of exception handlers.
In OCaml, an exception handler is declared using a try/with expression. Here's the
basic syntax.
try <expr> with
| <pat1> -> <expr1>
| <pat2> -> <expr2>
...
A try/with clause rst evaluates its body, expr. If no exception is thrown, then the
result of evaluating the body is what the entire try/with clause evaluates to.
But if the evaluation of the body throws an exception, then the exception will be fed
to the pattern-match clauses following the with. If the exception matches a pattern, then
we consider the exception caught, and the try/with clause evaluates to the expression
on the right-hand side of the matching pattern.
Otherwise, the original exception continues up the stack of function calls, to be han-
dled by the next outer exception handler. If the exception is never caught, it terminates
the program.

128
Error Handling
8.2.3
Cleaning Up in the Presence of Exceptions
One headache with exceptions is that they can terminate your execution at unexpected
places, leaving your program in an awkward state. Consider the following function
for loading a le full of numerical data. This code parses data that matches a simple
comma-separated le format, where each eld is a oating point number. In this
example we open Stdio, to get access to routines for reading from les.
# open Stdio;;
# let parse_line line =
String.split_on_chars ~on:[','] line
|> List.map ~f:Float.of_string;;
val parse_line : string -> float list = <fun>
# let load filename =
let inc = In_channel.create filename in
let data =
In_channel.input_lines inc
|> List.map ~f:parse_line
in
In_channel.close inc;
data;;
val load : string -> float list list = <fun>
One problem with this code is that the parsing function can throw an exception if
the le in question is malformed. Unfortunately, that means that the In_channel.t that
was opened will never be closed, leading to a le-descriptor leak.
We can x this using Base's Exn.protect function, which takes two arguments: a
thunk f, which is the main body of the computation to be run; and a thunk finally,
which is to be called when f exits, whether it exits normally or with an exception. This
is similar to the try/finally construct available in many programming languages, but
it is implemented in a library, rather than being a built-in primitive. Here's how it could
be used to x our load function:
# let load filename =
let inc = In_channel.create filename in
Exn.protect
~f:(fun () -> In_channel.input_lines inc |> List.map
~f:parse_line)
~finally:(fun () -> In_channel.close inc);;
val load : string -> float list list = <fun>
This is a common enough problem that In_channel has a function called with_file
that automates this pattern:
# let load filename =
In_channel.with_file filename ~f:(fun inc ->
In_channel.input_lines inc |> List.map ~f:parse_line);;
val load : string -> float list list = <fun>
In_channel.with_file is built on top of protect so that it can clean up after itself
in the presence of exceptions.

8.2 Catching Specic Exceptions
129
8.2.4
Catching Specic Exceptions
OCaml's exception-handling system allows you to tune your error-recovery logic to the
particular error that was thrown. For example, find_exn, which we dened earlier in
the chapter, throws Key_not_found when the element in question can't be found. Let's
look at an example of how you could take advantage of this. In particular, consider the
following function:
# let lookup_weight ~compute_weight alist key =
try
let data = find_exn alist key in
compute_weight data
with
Key_not_found _ -> 0.;;
val lookup_weight :
compute_weight:('a -> float) -> (string * 'a) list -> string ->
float =
<fun>
As you can see from the type, lookup_weight takes an association list, a key for
looking up a corresponding value in that list, and a function for computing a oating-
point weight from the looked-up value. If no value is found, then a weight of 0. should
be returned.
The use of exceptions in this code, however, presents some problems. In particular,
what happens if compute_weight throws an exception? Ideally, lookup_weight should
propagate that exception on, but if the exception happens to be Key_not_found, then
that's not what will happen:
# lookup_weight ~compute_weight:(fun _ -> raise (Key_not_found "foo"))
["a",3; "b",4] "a";;
- : float = 0.
This kind of problem is hard to detect in advance because the type system doesn't
tell you what exceptions a given function might throw. For this reason, it's usually best
to avoid relying on the identity of the exception to determine the nature of a failure. A
better approach is to narrow the scope of the exception handler, so that when it res
it's very clear what part of the code failed:
# let lookup_weight ~compute_weight alist key =
match
try Some (find_exn alist key)
with _ -> None
with
| None -> 0.
| Some data -> compute_weight data;;
val lookup_weight :
compute_weight:('a -> float) -> (string * 'a) list -> string ->
float =
<fun>
This nesting of a try within a match expression is both awkward and involves some
unnecessary computation (in particular, the allocation of the option). Happily, OCaml
allows for exceptions to be caught by match expressions directly, which lets you write
this more concisely as follows.

130
Error Handling
# let lookup_weight ~compute_weight alist key =
match find_exn alist key with
| exception _ -> 0.
| data -> compute_weight data;;
val lookup_weight :
compute_weight:('a -> float) -> (string * 'a) list -> string ->
float =
<fun>
Note that the exception keyword is used to mark the exception-handling cases.
Best of all is to avoid exceptions entirely, which we could do by using the exception-
free function from Base, List.Assoc.find, instead:
# let lookup_weight ~compute_weight alist key =
match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal alist key with
| None -> 0.
| Some data -> compute_weight data;;
val lookup_weight :
compute_weight:('a -> float) ->
(string, 'a) Base.List.Assoc.t -> string -> float = <fun>
8.2.5
Backtraces
A big part of the value of exceptions is that they provide useful debugging information
in the form of a stack backtrace. Consider the following simple program:
open Base
open Stdio
exception Empty_list
let list_max = function
| [] -> raise Empty_list
| hd :: tl -> List.fold tl ~init:hd ~f:(Int.max)
let () =
printf "%d\n" (list_max [1;2;3]);
printf "%d\n" (list_max [])
If we build and run this program, we'll get a stack backtrace that will provide some
information about where the error occurred and the stack of function calls that were in
place at the time of the error:
$ dune exec -- ./blow_up.exe
3
Fatal error: exception Dune__exe__Blow_up.Empty_list
Raised at Dune__exe__Blow_up.list_max in file "blow_up.ml", line 6,
characters 10-26
Called from Dune__exe__Blow_up in file "blow_up.ml", line 11,
characters 16-29
[2]
You
can
also
capture
a
backtrace
within
your
program
by
calling
Backtrace.Exn.most_recent, which returns the backtrace of the most recently thrown
exception. This is useful for reporting detailed information on errors that did not cause
your program to fail.

8.2 Backtraces
131
This works well if you have backtraces enabled, but that isn't always the case. In
fact, by default, OCaml has backtraces turned o, and even if you have them turned on
at runtime, you can't get backtraces unless you have compiled with debugging symbols.
Base reverses the default, so if you're linking in Base, you will have backtraces enabled
by default.
Even using Base and compiling with debugging symbols, you can turn backtraces
o via the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable, as shown below.
$ OCAMLRUNPARAM=b=0 dune exec -- ./blow_up.exe
3
Fatal error: exception Dune__exe__Blow_up.Empty_list
[2]
The resulting error message is considerably less informative. You can also turn
backtraces o in your code by calling Backtrace.Exn.set_recording false.
There is a legitimate reason to run without backtraces: speed. OCaml's exceptions
are fairly fast, but they're faster still if you disable backtraces. Here's a simple bench-
mark that shows the eect, using the core_bench package:
open Core
open Core_bench
exception Exit
let x = 0
type how_to_end = Ordinary | Raise | Raise_no_backtrace
let computation how_to_end =
let x = 10 in
let y = 40 in
let _z = x + (y * y) in
match how_to_end with
| Ordinary -> ()
| Raise -> raise Exit
| Raise_no_backtrace -> raise_notrace Exit
let computation_with_handler how = try computation how with Exit -> ()
let () =
[
Bench.Test.create ~name:"simple computation" (fun () ->
computation Ordinary);
Bench.Test.create ~name:"computation w/handler" (fun () ->
computation_with_handler Ordinary);
Bench.Test.create ~name:"end with exn" (fun () ->
computation_with_handler Raise);
Bench.Test.create ~name:"end with exn notrace" (fun () ->
computation_with_handler Raise_no_backtrace);
]
|> Bench.make_command |> Command.run
We're testing four cases here:
• a simple computation with no exception,

132
Error Handling
• the same, but with an exception handler but no exception thrown,
• the same, but where an exception is thrown,
• and nally, the same, but where we throw an exception using raise_notrace, which
is a version of raise which locally avoids the costs of keeping track of the
backtrace.
Here are the results.
$ dune exec -- \
> ./exn_cost.exe -ascii -quota 1 -clear-columns time cycles
Estimated testing time 4s (4 benchmarks x 1s). Change using '-quota'.

6.23c
end with exn
27.96ns
55.69c
end with exn notrace
11.69ns
23.28c
Note that we lose just a small number of cycles to setting up an exception handler,
which means that an unused exception handler is quite cheap indeed. We lose a much
bigger chunk, around 55 cycles, to actually raising an exception. If we explicitly raise
an exception with no backtrace, it costs us about 25 cycles.
We can also disable backtraces, as we discussed, using OCAMLRUNPARAM. That changes
the results a bit.
$ OCAMLRUNPARAM=b=0 dune exec -- \
> ./exn_cost.exe -ascii -quota 1 -clear-columns time cycles
Estimated testing time 4s (4 benchmarks x 1s). Change using '-quota'.

end with exn notrace

The only signicant change here is that raising an exception in the ordinary way
becomes just a bit cheaper: 20 cycles instead of 55 cycles. But it's still not as fast as
using raise_notrace explicitly.
Dierences on this scale should only matter if you're using exceptions routinely as
part of your ow control. That's not a common pattern, and when you do need it, it's
better from a performance perspective to use raise_notrace. All of which is to say,
you should almost always leave stack-traces on.
8.2.6
From Exceptions to Error-Aware Types and Back Again
Both exceptions and error-aware types are necessary parts of programming in OCaml.
As such, you often need to move between these two worlds. Happily, Base comes with
some useful helper functions to help you do just that. For example, given a piece of
code that can throw an exception, you can capture that exception into an option as
follows:

8.3 Choosing an Error-Handling Strategy
133
# let find alist key =
Option.try_with (fun () -> find_exn alist key);;
val find : (string * 'a) list -> string -> 'a option = <fun>
# find ["a",1; "b",2] "c";;
- : int option = Base.Option.None
# find ["a",1; "b",2] "b";;
- : int option = Base.Option.Some 2
Result and Or_error have similar try_with functions. So, we could write:
# let find alist key =
Or_error.try_with (fun () -> find_exn alist key);;
val find : (string * 'a) list -> string -> 'a Or_error.t = <fun>
# find ["a",1; "b",2] "c";;
- : int Or_error.t = Base__.Result.Error ("Key_not_found(\"c\")")
We can then reraise that exception:
# Or_error.ok_exn (find ["a",1; "b",2] "b");;
- : int = 2
# Or_error.ok_exn (find ["a",1; "b",2] "c");;
Exception: Key_not_found("c").
8.3
Choosing an Error-Handling Strategy
Given that OCaml supports both exceptions and error-aware return types, how do you
choose between them? The key is to think about the trade-o between concision and
explicitness.
Exceptions are more concise because they allow you to defer the job of error handling
to some larger scope, and because they don't clutter up your types. But this concision
comes at a cost: exceptions are all too easy to ignore. Error-aware return types, on the
other hand, are fully manifest in your type denitions, making the errors that your code
might generate explicit and impossible to ignore.
The right trade-o depends on your application. If you're writing a rough-and-ready
program where getting it done quickly is key and failure is not that expensive, then
using exceptions extensively may be the way to go. If, on the other hand, you're writing
production software whose failure is costly, then you should probably lean in the
direction of using error-aware return types.
To be clear, it doesn't make sense to avoid exceptions entirely. The maxim of use
exceptions for exceptional conditions applies. If an error occurs suciently rarely,
then throwing an exception is often the right behavior.
Also, for errors that are omnipresent, error-aware return types may be overkill. A
good example is out-of-memory errors, which can occur anywhere, and so you'd need
to use error-aware return types everywhere to capture those. Having every operation
marked as one that might fail is no more explicit than having none of them marked.
In short, for errors that are a foreseeable and ordinary part of the execution of your
production code and that are not omnipresent, error-aware return types are typically
the right solution.

Imperative Programming
This chapter includes contributions from Jason Hickey.
Most of the code shown so far in this book, and indeed, most OCaml code in general,
is pure. Pure code works without mutating the program's internal state, performing I/O,
reading the clock, or in any other way interacting with changeable parts of the world.
Thus, a pure function behaves like a mathematical function, always returning the same
results when given the same inputs, and never aecting the world except insofar as it
returns the value of its computation. Imperative code, on the other hand, operates by
side eects that modify a program's internal state or interact with the outside world.
An imperative function has a new eect, and potentially returns dierent results, every
time it's called.
Pure code is the default in OCaml, and for good reasonit's generally easier
to reason about, less error prone and more composable. But imperative code is of
fundamental importance to any practical programming language, because real-world
tasks require that you interact with the outside world, which is by its nature imperative.
Imperative programming can also be important for performance. While pure code is
quite ecient in OCaml, there are many algorithms that can only be implemented
eciently using imperative techniques.
OCaml oers a happy compromise here, making it easy and natural to program in a
pure style, but also providing great support for imperative programming. This chapter
will walk you through OCaml's imperative features, and help you use them to their
fullest.
9.1
Example: Imperative Dictionaries
We'll start with the implementation of a simple imperative dictionary, i.e., a mutable
mapping from keys to values. This is very much a toy implementation, and it's really
not suitable for any real-world use. That's ne, since both Base and the standard
library provide eective imperative dictionaries. There's more advice on using Base's
implementation in particular in Chapter 15 (Maps and Hash Tables).
The dictionary we'll describe now, like those in Base and the standard library, will
be implemented as a hash table. In particular, we'll use an open hashing scheme, where

9.1 Example: Imperative Dictionaries
135
the hash table will be an array of buckets, each bucket containing a list of key/value
pairs that have been hashed into that bucket.
Here's the signature we'll match, provided as an interface le, dictionary.mli. The
type ('a, 'b) t represents a dictionary with keys of type 'a and data of type 'b.
open Base
type ('a, 'b) t
val create
:
hash:('a -> int)
-> equal:('a -> 'a -> bool)
-> ('a, 'b) t
val length : ('a, 'b) t -> int
val add : ('a, 'b) t -> key:'a -> data:'b -> unit
val find : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b option
val iter : ('a, 'b) t -> f:(key:'a -> data:'b -> unit) -> unit
val remove : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> unit
This mli also includes a collection of helper functions whose purpose and behavior
should be largely inferable from their names and type signatures. Note that the create
function takes as its arguments functions for hashing keys and testing them for equality.
You might notice that some of the functions, like add and iter, return unit. This
is unusual for functional code, but common for imperative functions whose primary
purpose is to mutate some data structure, rather than to compute a value.
We'll now walk through the implementation (contained in the corresponding ml
le, dictionary.ml) piece by piece, explaining dierent imperative constructs as they
come up.
Our rst step is to dene the type of a dictionary as a record.
open Base
type ('a, 'b) t =
{ mutable length : int
; buckets : ('a * 'b) list array
; hash : 'a -> int
; equal : 'a -> 'a -> bool
}
The rst eld, length, is declared as mutable. In OCaml, records are immutable
by default, but individual elds are mutable when marked as such. The second eld,
buckets, is immutable but contains an array, which is itself a mutable data structure.
The remaining elds contain the functions for hashing and equality checking.
Now we'll start putting together the basic functions for manipulating a dictionary:
let num_buckets = 17
let hash_bucket t key = t.hash key % num_buckets
let create ~hash ~equal =
{ length = 0
; buckets = Array.create ~len:num_buckets []
; hash

136
Imperative Programming
; equal
}
let length t = t.length
let find t key =
List.find_map
t.buckets.(hash_bucket t key)
~f:(fun (key', data) ->
if t.equal key' key then Some data else None)
Note that num_buckets is a constant, which means our bucket array is of xed length.
A practical implementation would need to be able to grow the array as the number of
elements in the dictionary increases, but we'll omit this to simplify the presentation.
The function hash_bucket is used throughout the rest of the module to choose the
position in the array that a given key should be stored at.
The other functions dened above are fairly straightforward:
create Creates an empty dictionary.
length Grabs the length from the corresponding record eld, thus returning the
number of entries stored in the dictionary.
find Looks for a matching key in the table and returns the corresponding value if
found as an option.
Another important piece of imperative syntax shows up in find: we write
array.(index) to grab a value from an array. find also uses List.find_map, which
you can see the type of by typing it into the toplevel:
# open Base;;
# List.find_map;;
- : 'a list -> f:('a -> 'b option) -> 'b option = <fun>
List.find_map iterates over the elements of the list, calling f on each one until a
Some is returned by f, at which point that value is returned. If f returns None on all
values, then None is returned.
Now let's look at the implementation of iter:
let iter t ~f =
for i = 0 to Array.length t.buckets - 1 do
List.iter t.buckets.(i) ~f:(fun (key, data) -> f ~key ~data)
done
iter is designed to walk over all the entries in the dictionary. In particular, iter
t ~f will call f for each key/value pair in dictionary t. Note that f must return unit,
since it is expected to work by side eect rather than by returning a value, and the
overall iter function returns unit as well.
The code for iter uses two forms of iteration: a for loop to walk over the array of
buckets; and within that loop a call to List.iter to walk over the values in a given
bucket. We could have done the outer loop with a recursive function instead of a for
loop, but for loops are syntactically convenient, and are more familiar and idiomatic
in imperative contexts.
The following code is for adding and removing mappings from the dictionary:

9.1 Example: Imperative Dictionaries
137
let bucket_has_key t i key =
List.exists t.buckets.(i) ~f:(fun (key', _) -> t.equal key' key)
let add t ~key ~data =
let i = hash_bucket t key in
let replace = bucket_has_key t i key in
let filtered_bucket =
if replace
then
List.filter t.buckets.(i) ~f:(fun (key', _) ->
not (t.equal key' key))
else t.buckets.(i)
in
t.buckets.(i) <- (key, data) :: filtered_bucket;
if not replace then t.length <- t.length + 1
let remove t key =
let i = hash_bucket t key in
if bucket_has_key t i key
then (
let filtered_bucket =
List.filter t.buckets.(i) ~f:(fun (key', _) ->
not (t.equal key' key))
in
t.buckets.(i) <- filtered_bucket;
t.length <- t.length - 1)
This preceding code is made more complicated by the fact that we need to detect
whether we are overwriting or removing an existing binding, so we can decide whether
t.length needs to be changed. The helper function bucket_has_key is used for this
purpose.
Another piece of syntax shows up in both add and remove: the use of the <- operator
to update elements of an array (array.(i) <- expr) and for updating a record eld
(record.field <- expression).
We also use ;, the sequencing operator, to express a sequence of imperative actions.
We could have done the same using let bindings:
let () = t.buckets.(i) <- (key, data) :: filtered_bucket in
if not replace then t.length <- t.length + 1
but ; is more concise and idiomatic. More generally,
<expr1>;
<expr2>;
...
<exprN>
is equivalent to
let () = <expr1> in
let () = <expr2> in
...
<exprN>
When a sequence expression expr1; expr2 is evaluated, expr1 is evaluated rst,
and then expr2. The expression expr1 should have type unit (though this is a warning

138
Imperative Programming
rather than a hard restriction. The -strict-sequence compiler ag makes this a hard
restriction, which is generally a good idea), and the value of expr2 is returned as
the value of the entire sequence. For example, the sequence print_string "hello
world"; 1 + 2 rst prints the string "hello world", then returns the integer 3.
Note also that we do all of the side-eecting operations at the very end of each
function. This is good practice because it minimizes the chance that such operations
will be interrupted with an exception, leaving the data structure in an inconsistent state.
9.2
Primitive Mutable Data
Now that we've looked at a complete example, let's take a more systematic look at
imperative programming in OCaml. We encountered two dierent forms of mutable
data above: records with mutable elds and arrays. We'll now discuss these in more
detail, along with the other primitive forms of mutable data that are available in OCaml.
9.2.1
Array-Like Data
OCaml supports a number of array-like data structures; i.e., mutable integer-indexed
containers that provide constant-time access to their elements. We'll discuss several of
them in this section.
Ordinary arrays
The array type is used for general-purpose polymorphic arrays. The Array module
has a variety of utility functions for interacting with arrays, including a number of
mutating operations. These include Array.set, for setting an individual element, and
Array.blit, for eciently copying values from one range of indices to another.
Arrays also come with special syntax for retrieving an element from an array:
<array_expr>.(<index_expr>)
and for setting an element in an array:
<array_expr>.(<index_expr>) <- <value_expr>
Out-of-bounds accesses for arrays (and indeed for all the array-like data structures)
will lead to an exception being thrown.
Array literals are written using [| and |] as delimiters. Thus, [| 1; 2; 3 |] is a
literal integer array.
bytes and strings.
The strings we've encountered thus far are essentially byte arrays, and are most often
used for textual data. You could imagine using a char array (a char represents an
8-bit character) for the same purpose, but strings are considerably more space-ecient;
an array uses one 8-byte word on a 64-bit machineto store a single entry, whereas
strings use one byte per character.

9.2 Ref cells
139
Unlike arrays, though, strings are immutable, and sometimes, it's convenient to have
a space-ecient, mutable array of bytes. Happily, OCaml has that, via the bytes type.
You can set individual characters using Bytes.set, and a value of type bytes can
be converted to and from the string type.
# let b = Bytes.of_string "foobar";;
val b : bytes = "foobar"
# Bytes.set b 0 (Char.uppercase (Bytes.get b 0));;
- : unit = ()
# Bytes.to_string b;;
- : string = "Foobar"
Bigarrays
A Bigarray.t is a handle to a block of memory stored outside of the OCaml heap.
These are mostly useful for interacting with C or Fortran libraries, and are discussed in
Chapter 24 (Memory Representation of Values). Bigarrays too have their own getting
and setting syntax:
<bigarray_expr>.{<index_expr>}
<bigarray_expr>.{<index_expr>} <- <value_expr>
9.2.2
Mutable Record and Object Fields and Ref Cells
As we've seen, records are immutable by default, but individual record elds can
be declared as mutable. These mutable elds can be set using the <- operator, i.e.,
record.field <- expr.
As we'll see in Chapter 13 (Objects), elds of an object can similarly be declared
as mutable, and can then be modied in much the same way as record elds.
Ref cells
Variables in OCaml are never mutablethey can refer to mutable data, but what the
variable points to can't be changed. Sometimes, though, you want to do exactly what
you would do with a mutable variable in another language: dene a single, mutable
value. In OCaml this is typically achieved using a ref, which is essentially a container
with a single mutable polymorphic eld.
The denition for the ref type is as follows:
# type 'a ref = { mutable contents : 'a };;
type 'a ref = { mutable contents : 'a; }
The standard library denes the following operators for working with refs.
ref expr Constructs a reference cell containing the value dened by the expression
expr.
!refcell Returns the contents of the reference cell.
refcell := expr Replaces the contents of the reference cell.
You can see these in action:

140
Imperative Programming
# let x = ref 1;;
val x : int ref = {Base.Ref.contents = 1}
# !x;;
- : int = 1
# x := !x + 1;;
- : unit = ()
# !x;;
- : int = 2
The preceding are just ordinary OCaml functions, which could be dened as follows:
# let ref x = { contents = x };;
val ref : 'a -> 'a ref = <fun>
# let (!) r = r.contents;;
val ( ! ) : 'a ref -> 'a = <fun>
# let (:=) r x = r.contents <- x;;
val ( := ) : 'a ref -> 'a -> unit = <fun>
This reects the fact that ref cells are really just a special case of mutable record
elds.
9.2.3
Foreign Functions
Another source of imperative operations in OCaml is resources that come from inter-
facing with external libraries through OCaml's foreign function interface (FFI). The
FFI opens OCaml up to imperative constructs that are exported by system calls or other
external libraries. Many of these come built in, like access to the write system call or
to the clock, while others come from user libraries. OCaml's FFI is discussed in more
detail in Chapter 23 (Foreign Function Interface).
9.3
For and While Loops
OCaml provides support for traditional imperative looping constructs, in particular,
for and while loops. Neither of these constructs is strictly necessary, since they can
be simulated with recursive functions. Nonetheless, explicit for and while loops are
both more concise and more idiomatic when programming imperatively.
The for loop is the simpler of the two. Indeed, we've already seen the for loop in
actionthe iter function in Dictionary is built using it. Here's a simple example of
for. Note that we open the Stdio library to get access to the printf function.
# open Stdio;;
# for i = 0 to 3 do printf "i = %d\n" i done;;
i = 0
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
- : unit = ()
As you can see, the upper and lower bounds are inclusive. We can also use downto
to iterate in the other direction:

9.4 Example: Doubly Linked Lists
141
# for i = 3 downto 0 do printf "i = %d\n" i done;;
i = 3
i = 2
i = 1
i = 0
- : unit = ()
Note that the loop variable of a for loop, i in this case, is immutable in the scope
of the loop and is also local to the loop, i.e., it can't be referenced outside of the loop.
OCaml also supports while loops, which include a condition and a body. The loop
rst evaluates the condition, and then, if it evaluates to true, evaluates the body and
starts the loop again. Here's a simple example of a function for reversing an array in
place:
# let rev_inplace ar =
let i = ref 0 in
let j = ref (Array.length ar - 1) in
(* terminate when the upper and lower indices meet *)
while !i < !j do
(* swap the two elements *)
let tmp = ar.(!i) in
ar.(!i) <- ar.(!j);
ar.(!j) <- tmp;
(* bump the indices *)
Int.incr i;
Int.decr j
done;;
val rev_inplace : 'a array -> unit = <fun>
# let nums = [|1;2;3;4;5|];;
val nums : int array = [|1; 2; 3; 4; 5|]
# rev_inplace nums;;
- : unit = ()
# nums;;
- : int array = [|5; 4; 3; 2; 1|]
In the preceding example, we used Int.incr and Int.decr, which are built-in
functions for incrementing and decrementing an int ref by one, respectively.
9.4
Example: Doubly Linked Lists
Another common imperative data structure is the doubly linked list. Doubly linked
lists can be traversed in both directions, and elements can be added and removed
from the list in constant time. Core denes a doubly linked list (the module is called
Doubly_linked), but we'll dene our own linked list library as an illustration.
Here's the mli of the module we'll build:
open Base
type 'a t
type 'a element
(** Basic list operations *)

142
Imperative Programming
val create : unit -> 'a t
val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
(** Navigation using [element]s *)
val first : 'a t -> 'a element option
val next : 'a element -> 'a element option
val prev : 'a element -> 'a element option
val value : 'a element -> 'a
(** Whole-data-structure iteration *)
val iter : 'a t -> f:('a -> unit) -> unit
val find_el : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a element option
(** Mutation *)
val insert_first : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a element
val insert_after : 'a element -> 'a -> 'a element
val remove : 'a t -> 'a element -> unit
Note that there are two types dened here: 'a t, the type of a list; and 'a element,
the type of an element. Elements act as pointers to the interior of a list and allow us to
navigate the list and give us a point at which to apply mutating operations.
Now let's look at the implementation. We'll start by dening 'a element and 'a t:
open Base
type 'a element =
{ value : 'a
; mutable next : 'a element option
; mutable prev : 'a element option
}
type 'a t = 'a element option ref
An 'a element is a record containing the value to be stored in that node as well
as optional (and mutable) elds pointing to the previous and next elements. At the
beginning of the list, the prev eld is None, and at the end of the list, the next eld is
None.
The type of the list itself, 'a t, is a mutable reference to an optional element. This
reference is None if the list is empty, and Some otherwise.
Now we can dene a few basic functions that operate on lists and elements:
let create () = ref None
let is_empty t = Option.is_none !t
let value elt = elt.value
let first t = !t
let next elt = elt.next
let prev elt = elt.prev
These all follow relatively straightforwardly from our type denitions.

9.4 Modifying the List
143
Cyclic Data Structures
Doubly linked lists are a cyclic data structure, meaning that it is possible to follow
a nontrivial sequence of pointers that closes in on itself. In general, building cyclic
data structures requires the use of side eects. This is done by constructing the data
elements rst, and then adding cycles using assignment afterward.
There is an exception to this, though: you can construct xed-size cyclic data
structures using let rec:
# let rec endless_loop = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: endless_loop;;
val endless_loop : int list = [1; 2; 3; <cycle>]
This approach is quite limited, however. General-purpose cyclic data structures
require mutation.
9.4.1
Modifying the List
Now, we'll start considering operations that mutate the list, starting with insert_first,
which inserts an element at the front of the list:
let insert_first t value =
let new_elt = { prev = None; next = !t; value } in
(match !t with
| Some old_first -> old_first.prev <- Some new_elt
| None -> ());
t := Some new_elt;
new_elt
insert_first rst denes a new element new_elt, and then links it into the list,
nally setting the list itself to point to new_elt. Note that the precedence of a match
expression is very low, so to separate it from the following assignment (t := Some
new_elt), we surround the match with parentheses. We could have used begin ... end
for the same purpose, but without some kind of bracketing, the nal assignment would
incorrectly become part of the None case.
We can use insert_after to insert elements later in the list. insert_after takes as
arguments both an element after which to insert the new node and a value to insert:
let insert_after elt value =
let new_elt = { value; prev = Some elt; next = elt.next } in
(match elt.next with
| Some old_next -> old_next.prev <- Some new_elt
| None -> ());
elt.next <- Some new_elt;
new_elt
We also need a remove function:
let remove t elt =
let { prev; next; _ } = elt in
(match prev with
| Some prev -> prev.next <- next
| None -> t := next);
(match next with

144
Imperative Programming
| Some next -> next.prev <- prev
| None -> ());
elt.prev <- None;
elt.next <- None
Note that the preceding code is careful to change the prev pointer of the following
element and the next pointer of the previous element, if they exist. If there's no previous
element, then the list pointer itself is updated. In any case, the next and previous pointers
of the element itself are set to None.
These functions are more fragile than they may seem. In particular, misuse of the
interface may lead to corrupted data. For example, double-removing an element will
cause the main list reference to be set to None, thus emptying the list. Similar problems
arise from removing an element from a list it doesn't belong to.
This shouldn't be a big surprise. Complex imperative data structures can be quite
tricky, considerably trickier than their pure equivalents. The issues described previously
can be dealt with by more careful error detection, and such error correction is taken care
of in modules like Core's Doubly_linked. You should use imperative data structures
from a well-designed library when you can. And when you can't, you should make
sure to put great care into your error handling.
9.4.2
Iteration Functions
When dening containers like lists, dictionaries, and trees, you'll typically want to
dene a set of iteration functions like iter, map, and fold, which let you concisely
express common iteration patterns.
Dlist has two such iterators: iter, the goal of which is to call a unit-producing
function on every element of the list, in order; and find_el, which runs a provided test
function on each value stored in the list, returning the rst element that passes the test.
Both iter and find_el are implemented using simple recursive loops that use next to
walk from element to element and value to extract the element from a given node:
let iter t ~f =
let rec loop = function
| None -> ()
| Some el ->
f (value el);
loop (next el)
in
loop !t
let find_el t ~f =
let rec loop = function
| None -> None
| Some elt -> if f (value elt) then Some elt else loop (next elt)
in
loop !t
This completes our implementation, but there's still considerably more work to be
done to make a really usable doubly linked list. As mentioned earlier, you're probably
better o using something like Core Doubly_linked module that has a more complete

9.5 Laziness and Other Benign Eects
145
interface and has more of the tricky corner cases worked out. Nonetheless, this example
should serve to demonstrate some of the techniques you can use to build nontrivial
imperative data structure in OCaml, as well as some of the pitfalls.
9.5
Laziness and Other Benign Eects
There are many instances where you basically want to program in a pure style, but
you want to make limited use of side eects to improve the performance of your code.
Such side eects are sometimes called benign eects, and they are a useful way of
leveraging OCaml's imperative features while still maintaining most of the benets of
pure programming.
One of the simplest benign eects is laziness. A lazy value is one that is not
computed until it is actually needed. In OCaml, lazy values are created using the lazy
keyword, which can be used to convert any expression of type s into a lazy value of type
s lazy_t. The evaluation of that expression is delayed until forced with Lazy.force:
# let v = lazy (print_endline "performing lazy computation";
Float.sqrt 16.);;
val v : float lazy_t = <lazy>
# Lazy.force v;;
performing lazy computation
- : float = 4.
# Lazy.force v;;
- : float = 4.
You can see from the print statement that the actual computation was performed
only once, and only after force had been called.
To better understand how laziness works, let's walk through the implementation of
our own lazy type. We'll start by declaring types to represent a lazy value:
# type 'a lazy_state =
| Delayed of (unit -> 'a)
| Value of 'a
| Exn of exn;;
type 'a lazy_state = Delayed of (unit -> 'a) | Value of 'a | Exn of exn
# type 'a our_lazy = { mutable state : 'a lazy_state };;
type 'a our_lazy = { mutable state : 'a lazy_state; }
A lazy_state represents the possible states of a lazy value. A lazy value is Delayed
before it has been run, where Delayed holds a function for computing the value in
question. A lazy value is in the Value state when it has been forced and the computation
ended normally. The Exn case is for when the lazy value has been forced, but the
computation ended with an exception. A lazy value is simply a record with a single
mutable eld containing a lazy_state, where the mutability makes it possible to
change from being in the Delayed state to being in the Value or Exn states.
We can create a lazy value from a thunk, i.e., a function that takes a unit argument.
Wrapping an expression in a thunk is another way to suspend the computation of an
expression:

146
Imperative Programming
# let our_lazy f = { state = Delayed f };;
val our_lazy : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a our_lazy = <fun>
# let v =
our_lazy (fun () ->
print_endline "performing lazy computation"; Float.sqrt 16.);;
val v : float our_lazy = {state = Delayed <fun>}
Now we just need a way to force a lazy value. The following function does just that.
# let our_force l =
match l.state with
| Value x -> x
| Exn e -> raise e
| Delayed f ->
try
let x = f () in
l.state <- Value x;
x
with exn ->
l.state <- Exn exn;
raise exn;;
val our_force : 'a our_lazy -> 'a = <fun>
Which we can use in the same way we used Lazy.force:
# our_force v;;
performing lazy computation
- : float = 4.
# our_force v;;
- : float = 4.
The main user-visible dierence between our implementation of laziness and the
built-in version is syntax. Rather than writing our_lazy (fun () -> sqrt 16.), we
can (with the built-in lazy) just write lazy (sqrt 16.), avoiding the necessity of
declaring a function.
9.5.1
Memoization and Dynamic Programming
Another benign eect is memoization. A memoized function remembers the result
of previous invocations of the function so that they can be returned without further
computation when the same arguments are presented again.
Here's a function that takes as an argument an arbitrary single-argument function
and returns a memoized version of that function. Here we'll use Base's Hashtbl module,
rather than our toy Dictionary.
This implementation requires an argument of a Hashtbl.Key.t, which plays the role
of the hash and equal from Dictionary. Hashtbl.Key.t is an example of what's called
a rst-class module, which we'll see more of in Chapter 12 (First-Class Modules).
# let memoize m f =
let memo_table = Hashtbl.create m in
(fun x ->
Hashtbl.find_or_add memo_table x ~default:(fun () -> f x));;
val memoize : 'a Hashtbl.Key.t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b = <fun>

9.5 Memoization and Dynamic Programming
147
The preceding code is a bit tricky. memoize takes as its argument a function f
and then allocates a polymorphic hash table (called memo_table), and returns a new
function which is the memoized version of f. When called, this new function uses
Hashtbl.find_or_add to try to nd a value in the memo_table, and if it fails, to call f
and store the result. Note that memo_table is referred to by the function, and so won't
be collected until the function returned by memoize is itself collected.
Memoization can be useful whenever you have a function that is expensive to
recompute and you don't mind caching old values indenitely. One important caution:
a memoized function by its nature leaks memory. As long as you hold on to the
memoized function, you're holding every result it has returned thus far.
Memoization is also useful for eciently implementing some recursive algorithms.
One good example is the algorithm for computing the edit distance (also called the
Levenshtein distance) between two strings. The edit distance is the number of single-
character changes (including letter switches, insertions, and deletions) required to
convert one string to the other. This kind of distance metric can be useful for a variety
of approximate string-matching problems, like spellcheckers.
Consider the following code for computing the edit distance. Understanding the
algorithm isn't important here, but you should pay attention to the structure of the
recursive calls:
# let rec edit_distance s t =
match String.length s, String.length t with
| (0,x) | (x,0) -> x
| (len_s,len_t) ->
let s' = String.drop_suffix s 1 in
let t' = String.drop_suffix t 1 in
let cost_to_drop_both =
if Char.(=) s.[len_s - 1] t.[len_t - 1] then 0 else 1
in
List.reduce_exn ~f:Int.min
[ edit_distance s' t
+ 1
; edit_distance s
t' + 1
; edit_distance s' t' + cost_to_drop_both
];;
val edit_distance : string -> string -> int = <fun>
# edit_distance "OCaml" "ocaml";;
- : int = 2
The thing to note is that if you call edit_distance "OCaml" "ocaml", then that will
in turn dispatch the following calls:
And these calls will in turn dispatch other calls:

148
Imperative Programming
As you can see, some of these calls are repeats. For example, there are two dierent
calls to edit_distance "OCam" "oca". The number of redundant calls grows exponen-
tially with the size of the strings, meaning that our implementation of edit_distance
is brutally slow for large strings. We can see this by writing a small timing function,
using Core's Time module.
# let time f =
let open Core in
let start = Time.now () in
let x = f () in
let stop = Time.now () in
printf "Time: %F ms\n" (Time.diff stop start |> Time.Span.to_ms);
x;;
val time : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a = <fun>
And now we can use this to try out some examples:
# time (fun () -> edit_distance "OCaml" "ocaml");;
Time: 0.655651092529 ms
- : int = 2
# time (fun () -> edit_distance "OCaml 4.13" "ocaml 4.13");;
Time: 2541.6533947 ms
- : int = 2
Just those few extra characters made it thousands of times slower!
Memoization would be a huge help here, but to x the problem, we need to memoize
the calls that edit_distance makes to itself. Such recursive memoization is closely
related to a common algorithmic technique called dynamic programming, except that
with dynamic programming, you do the necessary sub-computations bottom-up, in
anticipation of needing them. With recursive memoization, you go top-down, only
doing a sub-computation when you discover that you need it.
To see how to do this, let's step away from edit_distance and instead consider
a much simpler example: computing the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence. The
Fibonacci sequence by denition starts out with two 1s, with every subsequent element
being the sum of the previous two. The classic recursive denition of Fibonacci is as
follows:
# let rec fib i =

9.5 Memoization and Dynamic Programming
149
if i <= 1 then i else fib (i - 1) + fib (i - 2);;
val fib : int -> int = <fun>
This is, however, exponentially slow, for the same reason that edit_distance was
slow: we end up making many redundant calls to fib. It shows up quite dramatically
in the performance:
# time (fun () -> fib 20);;
Time: 1.14369392395 ms
- : int = 6765
# time (fun () -> fib 40);;
Time: 14752.7184486 ms
- : int = 102334155
As you can see, fib 40 takes thousands of times longer to compute than fib 20.
So, how can we use memoization to make this faster? The tricky bit is that we need
to insert the memoization before the recursive calls within fib. We can't just dene
fib in the ordinary way and memoize it after the fact and expect the rst call to fib to
be improved.
# let fib = memoize (module Int) fib;;
val fib : int -> int = <fun>
# time (fun () -> fib 40);;
Time: 18174.5970249 ms
- : int = 102334155
# time (fun () -> fib 40);;
Time: 0.00524520874023 ms
- : int = 102334155
In order to make fib fast, our rst step will be to rewrite fib in a way that unwinds
the recursion. The following version expects as its rst argument a function (called
fib) that will be called in lieu of the usual recursive call.
# let fib_norec fib i =
if i <= 1 then i
else fib (i - 1) + fib (i - 2);;
val fib_norec : (int -> int) -> int -> int = <fun>
We can now turn this back into an ordinary Fibonacci function by tying the recursive
knot:
# let rec fib i = fib_norec fib i;;
val fib : int -> int = <fun>
# fib 20;;
- : int = 6765
We can even write a polymorphic function that we'll call make_rec that can tie the
recursive knot for any function of this form:
# let make_rec f_norec =
let rec f x = f_norec f x in
f;;
val make_rec : (('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b = <fun>
# let fib = make_rec fib_norec;;
val fib : int -> int = <fun>
# fib 20;;
- : int = 6765

150
Imperative Programming
This is a pretty strange piece of code, and it may take a few moments of thought
to gure out what's going on. Like fib_norec, the function f_norec passed in to
make_rec is a function that isn't recursive but takes as an argument a function that it
will call. What make_rec does is to essentially feed f_norec to itself, thus making it a
true recursive function.
This is clever enough, but all we've really done is nd a new way to implement the
same old slow Fibonacci function. To make it faster, we need a variant of make_rec that
inserts memoization when it ties the recursive knot. We'll call that function memo_rec:
# let memo_rec m f_norec x =
let fref = ref (fun _ -> assert false) in
let f = memoize m (fun x -> f_norec !fref x) in
fref := f;
f x;;
val memo_rec : 'a Hashtbl.Key.t -> (('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b =
<fun>
Note that memo_rec has almost the same signature as make_rec.
We're using the reference here as a way of tying the recursive knot without using a
let rec, which for reasons we'll describe later wouldn't work here.
Using memo_rec, we can now build an ecient version of fib:
# let fib = memo_rec (module Int) fib_norec;;
val fib : int -> int = <fun>
# time (fun () -> fib 40);;
Time: 0.121355056763 ms
- : int = 102334155
As you can see, the exponential time complexity is now gone.
The memory behavior here is important. If you look back at the denition of
memo_rec, you'll see that the call memo_rec fib_norec does not trigger a call to memoize.
Only when fib is called and thereby the nal argument to memo_rec is presented does
memoize get called. The result of that call falls out of scope when the fib call returns,
and so calling memo_rec on a function does not create a memory leakthe memoization
table is collected after the computation completes.
We can use memo_rec as part of a single declaration that makes this look like it's
little more than a special form of let rec:
# let fib = memo_rec (module Int) (fun fib i ->
if i <= 1 then 1 else fib (i - 1) + fib (i - 2));;
val fib : int -> int = <fun>
Memoization is overkill for implementing Fibonacci, and indeed, the fib dened
above is not especially ecient, allocating space linear in the number passed into fib.
It's easy enough to write a Fibonacci function that takes a constant amount of space.
But memoization is a good approach for optimizing edit_distance, and we can
apply the same approach we used on fib here. We will need to change edit_distance
to take a pair of strings as a single argument, since memo_rec only works on single-
argument functions. (We can always recover the original interface with a wrapper
function.) With just that change and the addition of the memo_rec call, we can get a
memoized version of edit_distance. The memoization key is going to be a pair of

9.5 Memoization and Dynamic Programming
151
strings, so we need to get our hands on a module with the necessary functionality for
building a hash-table in Base.
Writing hash-functions and equality tests and the like by hand can be tedious and
error prone, so instead we'll use a few dierent syntax extensions for deriving the
necessary functionality automatically. By enabling ppx_jane, we pull in a collection
of such derivers, three of which we use in dening String_pair below.
# #require "ppx_jane";;
# module String_pair = struct
type t = string * string [@@deriving sexp_of, hash, compare]
end;;
module String_pair :
sig
type t = string * string
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
val hash_fold_t : Hash.state -> t -> Hash.state
val hash : t -> int
val compare : t -> t -> int
end
With that in hand, we can dene our optimized form of edit_distance.
# let edit_distance = memo_rec (module String_pair)
(fun edit_distance (s,t) ->
match String.length s, String.length t with
| (0,x) | (x,0) -> x
| (len_s,len_t) ->
let s' = String.drop_suffix s 1 in
let t' = String.drop_suffix t 1 in
let cost_to_drop_both =
if Char.(=) s.[len_s - 1] t.[len_t - 1] then 0 else 1
in
List.reduce_exn ~f:Int.min
[ edit_distance (s',t ) + 1
; edit_distance (s ,t') + 1
; edit_distance (s',t') + cost_to_drop_both
]);;
val edit_distance : String_pair.t -> int = <fun>
This new version of edit_distance is much more ecient than the one we started
with; the following call is many thousands of times faster than it was without memo-
ization.
# time (fun () -> edit_distance ("OCaml 4.09","ocaml 4.09"));;
Time: 0.964403152466 ms
- : int = 2
Limitations of let rec
You might wonder why we didn't tie the recursive knot in memo_rec using let rec, as
we did for make_rec earlier. Here's code that tries to do just that:
# let memo_rec m f_norec =
let rec f = memoize m (fun x -> f_norec f x) in
f;;
Line 2, characters 17-49:

152
Imperative Programming
Error: This kind of expression is not allowed as right-hand side of
`let rec'
OCaml rejects the denition because OCaml, as a strict language, has limits on what
it can put on the right-hand side of a let rec. In particular, imagine how the following
code snippet would be compiled:
let rec x = x + 1
Note that x is an ordinary value, not a function. As such, it's not clear how this
denition should be handled by the compiler. You could imagine it compiling down to
an innite loop, but x is of type int, and there's no int that corresponds to an innite
loop. As such, this construct is eectively impossible to compile.
To avoid such impossible cases, the compiler only allows three possible constructs to
show up on the right-hand side of a let rec: a function denition, a constructor, or the
lazy keyword. This excludes some reasonable things, like our denition of memo_rec,
but it also blocks things that don't make sense, like our denition of x.
It's worth noting that these restrictions don't show up in a lazy language like Haskell.
Indeed, we can make something like our denition of x work if we use OCaml's laziness:
# let rec x = lazy (force x + 1);;
val x : int lazy_t = <lazy>
Of course, actually trying to compute this will fail. OCaml's lazy throws an excep-
tion when a lazy value tries to force itself as part of its own evaluation.
# force x;;
Exception: Lazy.Undefined
But we can also create useful recursive denitions with lazy. In particular, we can
use laziness to make our denition of memo_rec work without explicit mutation:
# let lazy_memo_rec m f_norec x =
let rec f = lazy (memoize m (fun x -> f_norec (force f) x)) in
(force f) x;;
val lazy_memo_rec : 'a Hashtbl.Key.t -> (('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a ->
'b =
<fun>
# time (fun () -> lazy_memo_rec (module Int) fib_norec 40);;
Time: 0.181913375854 ms
- : int = 102334155
Laziness is more constrained than explicit mutation, and so in some cases can lead
to code whose behavior is easier to think about.
9.6
Input and Output
Imperative programming is about more than modifying in-memory data structures. Any
function that doesn't boil down to a deterministic transformation from its arguments
to its return value is imperative in nature. That includes not only things that mutate
your program's data, but also operations that interact with the world outside of your

9.6 Terminal I/O
153
program. An important example of this kind of interaction is I/O, i.e., operations for
reading or writing data to things like les, terminal input and output, and network
sockets.
There are multiple I/O libraries in OCaml. In this section we'll discuss OCaml's
buered I/O library that can be used through the In_channel and Out_channel mod-
ules in Stdio. Other I/O primitives are also available through the Unix module in Core
as well as Async, the asynchronous I/O library that is covered in Chapter 17 (Concur-
rent Programming with Async). Most of the functionality in Core's In_channel and
Out_channel (and in Core's Unix module) derives from the standard library, but we'll
use Core's interfaces here.
9.6.1
Terminal I/O
OCaml's buered I/O library is organized around two types: in_channel, for channels
you read from, and out_channel, for channels you write to. The In_channel and
Out_channel modules only have direct support for channels corresponding to les and
terminals; other kinds of channels can be created through the Unix module.
We'll start our discussion of I/O by focusing on the terminal. Following the UNIX
model, communication with the terminal is organized around three channels, which
correspond to the three standard le descriptors in Unix:
In_channel.stdin The standard input channel. By default, input comes from the
terminal, which handles keyboard input.
Out_channel.stdout The standard output channel. By default, output written to
stdout appears on the user terminal.
Out_channel.stderr The standard error channel. This is similar to stdout but is
intended for error messages.
The values stdin, stdout, and stderr are useful enough that they are also avail-
able in the top level of Core's namespace directly, without having to go through the
In_channel and Out_channel modules.
Let's see this in action in a simple interactive application. The following program,
time_converter, prompts the user for a time zone, and then prints out the current time
in that time zone. Here, we use Core's Zone module for looking up a time zone, and
the Time module for computing the current time and printing it out in the time zone in
question:
open Core
let () =
Out_channel.output_string stdout "Pick a timezone: ";
Out_channel.flush stdout;
match In_channel.(input_line stdin) with
| None -> failwith "No timezone provided"
| Some zone_string ->
let zone = Time.Zone.find_exn zone_string in
let time_string = Time.to_string_abs (Time.now ()) ~zone in
Out_channel.output_string stdout

154
Imperative Programming
(String.concat
["The time in ";Time.Zone.to_string zone;" is
";time_string;".\n"]);
Out_channel.flush stdout
We can build this program using dune and run it, though you'll need to add a
dune-project and dune le, as described in Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and Programs).
You'll see that it prompts you for input, as follows:
$ dune exec ./time_converter.exe
Pick a timezone:
You can then type in the name of a time zone and hit Return, and it will print out
the current time in the time zone in question:
Pick a timezone: Europe/London
The time in Europe/London is 2013-08-15 00:03:10.666220+01:00.
We called Out_channel.flush on stdout because out_channels are buered, which
is to say that OCaml doesn't immediately do a write every time you call output_string.
Instead, writes are buered until either enough has been written to trigger the ushing
of the buers, or until a ush is explicitly requested. This greatly increases the eciency
of the writing process by reducing the number of system calls.
Note that In_channel.input_line returns a string option, with None in-
dicating

(i.e.,
an
end-of-le
condition).
Out_channel.output_string is used to print the nal output, and Out_channel.flush
is called to ush that output to the screen. The nal ush is not technically required,
since the program ends after that instruction, at which point all remaining output will
be ushed anyway, but the explicit ush is nonetheless good practice.
9.6.2
Formatted Output with printf
Generating output with functions like Out_channel.output_string is simple and easy
to understand, but can be a bit verbose. OCaml also supports formatted output using
the printf function, which is modeled after printf in the C standard library. printf
takes a format string that describes what to print and how to format it, as well as
arguments to be printed, as determined by the formatting directives embedded in the
format string. So, for example, we can write:
# printf
"%i is an integer, %F is a float, \"%s\" is a string\n"
3 4.5 "five";;
3 is an integer, 4.5 is a float, "five" is a string
- : unit = ()
Unlike C's printf, the printf in OCaml is type-safe. In particular, if we provide
an argument whose type doesn't match what's presented in the format string, we'll get
a type error:
# printf "An integer: %i\n" 4.5;;
Line 1, characters 27-30:

9.6 Formatted Output with printf
155
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected
of type
int
Understanding Format Strings
The format strings used by printf turn out to be quite dierent from ordinary strings.
This dierence ties to the fact that OCaml's printf facility, unlike the equivalent in C,
is type-safe. In particular, the compiler checks that the types referred to by the format
string match the types of the rest of the arguments passed to printf.
To check this, OCaml needs to analyze the contents of the format string at compile
time, which means the format string needs to be available as a string literal at compile
time. Indeed, if you try to pass an ordinary string to printf, the compiler will complain:
# let fmt = "%i is an integer\n";;
val fmt : string = "%i is an integer\n"
# printf fmt 3;;
Line 1, characters 8-11:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
('a -> 'b, Stdio.Out_channel.t, unit) format =
('a -> 'b, Stdio.Out_channel.t, unit, unit, unit, unit)
format6
If OCaml infers that a given string literal is a format string, then it parses it at
compile time as such, choosing its type in accordance with the formatting directives
it nds. Thus, if we add a type annotation indicating that the string we're dening is
actually a format string, it will be interpreted as such. (Here, we open the Camlinter-
nalFormatBasics so that the representation of the format string that's printed out won't
ll the whole page.)
# open CamlinternalFormatBasics;;
# let fmt : ('a, 'b, 'c) format =
"%i is an integer\n";;
val fmt : (int -> 'c, 'b, 'c) format =
Format
(Int (Int_i, No_padding, No_precision,
String_literal (" is an integer\n", End_of_format)),
"%i is an integer\n")
And accordingly, we can pass it to printf:
# printf fmt 3;;
3 is an integer
- : unit = ()
If this looks dierent from everything else you've seen so far, that's because it is.
This is really a special case in the type system. Most of the time, you don't need to
know about this special handling of format stringsyou can just use printf and not
worry about the details. But it's useful to keep the broad outlines of the story in the
back of your head.

156
Imperative Programming
Now let's see how we can rewrite our time conversion program to be a little more
concise using printf:
open Core
let () =
printf "Pick a timezone: %!";
match In_channel.input_line In_channel.stdin with
| None -> failwith "No timezone provided"
| Some zone_string ->
let zone = Time.Zone.find_exn zone_string in
let time_string = Time.to_string_abs (Time.now ()) ~zone in
printf "The time in %s is %s.\n%!" (Time.Zone.to_string zone)
time_string
In the preceding example, we've used only two formatting directives: %s, for includ-
ing a string, and %! which causes printf to ush the channel.
printf's formatting directives oer a signicant amount of control, allowing you
to specify things like:
• Alignment and padding
• Escaping rules for strings
• Whether numbers should be formatted in decimal, hex, or binary
• Precision of oat conversions
There are also printf-style functions that target outputs other than stdout, includ-
ing:
• eprintf, which prints to stderr
• fprintf, which prints to an arbitrary out_channel
• sprintf, which returns a formatted string
All of this, and a good deal more, is described in the API documentation for the
Printf module in the OCaml Manual.
9.6.3
File I/O
Another common use of in_channels and out_channels is for working with les. Here
are a couple of functionsone that creates a le full of numbers, and the other that
reads in such a le and returns the sum of those numbers:
# let create_number_file filename numbers =
let outc = Out_channel.create filename in
List.iter numbers ~f:(fun x -> Out_channel.fprintf outc "%d\n" x);
Out_channel.close outc;;
val create_number_file : string -> int list -> unit = <fun>
# let sum_file filename =
let file = In_channel.create filename in
let numbers = List.map ~f:Int.of_string (In_channel.input_lines
file) in
let sum = List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) numbers in
In_channel.close file;

9.6 File I/O
157
sum;;
val sum_file : string -> int = <fun>
# create_number_file "numbers.txt" [1;2;3;4;5];;
- : unit = ()
# sum_file "numbers.txt";;
- : int = 15
For both of these functions, we followed the same basic sequence: we rst create the
channel, then use the channel, and nally close the channel. The closing of the channel
is important, since without it, we won't release resources associated with the le back
to the operating system.
One problem with the preceding code is that if it throws an exception in the middle
of its work, it won't actually close the le. If we try to read a le that doesn't actually
contain numbers, we'll see such an error:
# sum_file "/etc/hosts";;
Exception:
(Failure
"Int.of_string: \"127.0.0.1
localhost localhost.localdomain
localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4\"")
And if we do this over and over in a loop, we'll eventually run out of le descriptors:
# for i = 1 to 10000 do try ignore (sum_file "/etc/hosts") with _ ->
() done;;
- : unit = ()
# sum_file "numbers.txt";;
Error: I/O error: ...: Too many open files
And now, you'll need to restart your toplevel if you want to open any more les!
To avoid this, we need to make sure that our code cleans up after itself. We can do
this using the protect function described in Chapter 8 (Error Handling), as follows:
# let sum_file filename =
let file = In_channel.create filename in
Exn.protect ~f:(fun () ->
let numbers = List.map ~f:Int.of_string (In_channel.input_lines
file) in
List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) numbers)
~finally:(fun () -> In_channel.close file);;
val sum_file : string -> int = <fun>
And now, the le descriptor leak is gone:
# for i = 1 to 10000 do try ignore (sum_file "/etc/hosts" : int) with
_ -> () done;;
- : unit = ()
# sum_file "numbers.txt";;
- : int = 15
This is really an example of a more general issue with imperative programming and
exceptions. If you're changing the internal state of your program and you're interrupted
by an exception, you need to consider quite carefully if it's safe to continue working
from your current state.
In_channel has functions that automate the handling of some of these details. For

158
Imperative Programming
example, In_channel.with_file takes a lename and a function for processing data
from an in_channel and takes care of the bookkeeping associated with opening and
closing the le. We can rewrite sum_file using this function, as shown here:
# let sum_file filename =
In_channel.with_file filename ~f:(fun file ->
let numbers = List.map ~f:Int.of_string (In_channel.input_lines
file) in
List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) numbers);;
val sum_file : string -> int = <fun>
Another misfeature of our implementation of sum_file is that we read the entire
le into memory before processing it. For a large le, it's more ecient to process a
line at a time. You can use the In_channel.fold_lines function to do just that:
# let sum_file filename =
In_channel.with_file filename ~f:(fun file ->
In_channel.fold_lines file ~init:0 ~f:(fun sum line ->
sum + Int.of_string line));;
val sum_file : string -> int = <fun>
This is just a taste of the functionality of In_channel and Out_channel. To get a
fuller understanding, you should review the API documentation.
9.7
Order of Evaluation
The order in which expressions are evaluated is an important part of the denition of
a programming language, and it is particularly important when programming impera-
tively. Most programming languages you're likely to have encountered are strict, and
OCaml is too. In a strict language, when you bind an identier to the result of some
expression, the expression is evaluated before the variable is bound. Similarly, if you
call a function on a set of arguments, those arguments are evaluated before they are
passed to the function.
Consider the following simple example. Here, we have a collection of angles, and
we want to determine if any of them have a negative sin. The following snippet of
code would answer that question:
# let x = Float.sin 120. in
let y = Float.sin 75.
in
let z = Float.sin 128. in
List.exists ~f:(fun x -> Float.O.(x < 0.)) [x;y;z];;
- : bool = true
In some sense, we don't really need to compute the sin 128 because sin 75 is
negative, so we could know the answer before even computing sin 128.
It doesn't have to be this way. Using the lazy keyword, we can write the original
computation so that sin 128 won't ever be computed:
# let x = lazy (Float.sin 120.) in
let y = lazy (Float.sin 75.)
in
let z = lazy (Float.sin 128.) in

9.8 Side Eects and Weak Polymorphism
159
List.exists ~f:(fun x -> Float.O.(Lazy.force x < 0.)) [x;y;z];;
- : bool = true
We can conrm that fact by a few well-placed printfs:
# let x = lazy (printf "1\n"; Float.sin 120.) in
let y = lazy (printf "2\n"; Float.sin 75.)
in
let z = lazy (printf "3\n"; Float.sin 128.) in
List.exists ~f:(fun x -> Float.O.(Lazy.force x < 0.)) [x;y;z];;
1
2
- : bool = true
OCaml is strict by default for a good reason: lazy evaluation and imperative pro-
gramming generally don't mix well because laziness makes it harder to reason about
when a given side eect is going to occur. Understanding the order of side eects is
essential to reasoning about the behavior of an imperative program.
Because OCaml is strict, we know that expressions that are bound by a sequence
of let bindings will be evaluated in the order that they're dened. But what about the
evaluation order within a single expression? Ocially, the answer is that evaluation
order within an expression is undened. In practice, OCaml has only one compiler,
and that behavior is a kind of de facto standard. Unfortunately, the evaluation order in
this case is often the opposite of what one might expect.
Consider the following example:
# List.exists ~f:(fun x -> Float.O.(x < 0.))
[ (printf "1\n"; Float.sin 120.);
(printf "2\n"; Float.sin 75.);
(printf "3\n"; Float.sin 128.); ];;
3
2
1
- : bool = true
Here, you can see that the subexpression that came last was actually evaluated rst!
This is generally the case for many dierent kinds of expressions. If you want to make
sure of the evaluation order of dierent subexpressions, you should express them as a
series of let bindings.
9.8
Side Eects and Weak Polymorphism
Consider the following simple, imperative function:
# let remember =
let cache = ref None in
(fun x ->
match !cache with
| Some y -> y
| None -> cache := Some x; x);;
val remember : '_weak1 -> '_weak1 = <fun>
remember simply caches the rst value that's passed to it, returning that value on

160
Imperative Programming
every call. That's because cache is created and initialized once and is shared across
invocations of remember.
remember is not a terribly useful function, but it raises an interesting question: what
should its type be?
On its rst call, remember returns the same value it's passed, which means its input
type and return type should match. Accordingly, remember should have type t -> t for
some type t. There's nothing about remember that ties the choice of t to any particular
type, so you might expect OCaml to generalize, replacing t with a polymorphic type
variable. It's this kind of generalization that gives us polymorphic types in the rst
place. The identity function, as an example, gets a polymorphic type in this way:
# let identity x = x;;
val identity : 'a -> 'a = <fun>
# identity 3;;
- : int = 3
# identity "five";;
- : string = "five"
As you can see, the polymorphic type of identity lets it operate on values with
dierent types.
This is not what happens with remember, though. As you can see from the above
examples, the type that OCaml infers for remember looks almost, but not quite, like the
type of the identity function. Here it is again:
val remember : '_weak1 -> '_weak1 = <fun>
The underscore in the type variable '_weak1 tells us that the variable is only weakly
polymorphic, which is to say that it can be used with any single type. That makes sense
because, unlike identity, remember always returns the value it was passed on its rst
invocation, which means its return value must always have the same type.
OCaml will convert a weakly polymorphic variable to a concrete type as soon as it
gets a clue as to what concrete type it is to be used as:
# let remember_three () = remember 3;;
val remember_three : unit -> int = <fun>
# remember;;
- : int -> int = <fun>
# remember "avocado";;
Line 1, characters 10-19:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
int
Note that the type of remember was settled by the denition of remember_three, even
though remember_three was never called!
9.8.1
The Value Restriction
So, when does the compiler infer weakly polymorphic types? As we've seen, we need
weakly polymorphic types when a value of unknown type is stored in a persistent
mutable cell. Because the type system isn't precise enough to determine all cases

9.8 Partial Application and the Value Restriction
161
where this might happen, OCaml uses a rough rule to ag cases that don't introduce
any persistent mutable cells, and to only infer polymorphic types in those cases. This
rule is called the value restriction.
The core of the value restriction is the observation that some kinds of expressions,
which we'll refer to as simple values, by their nature can't introduce persistent mutable
cells, including:
• Constants (i.e., things like integer and oating-point literals)
• Constructors that only contain other simple values
• Function declarations, i.e., expressions that begin with fun or function, or the
equivalent let binding, let f x = ...
• let bindings of the form let var = expr1 in expr2, where both expr1 and expr2 are
simple values
Thus, the following expression is a simple value, and as a result, the types of values
contained within it are allowed to be polymorphic:
# (fun x -> [x;x]);;
- : 'a -> 'a list = <fun>
But, if we write down an expression that isn't a simple value by the preceding
denition, we'll get dierent results.
# identity (fun x -> [x;x]);;
- : '_weak2 -> '_weak2 list = <fun>
In principle, it would be safe to infer a fully polymorphic variable here, but because
OCaml's type system doesn't distinguish between pure and impure functions, it can't
separate those two cases.
The value restriction doesn't require that there is no mutable state, only that there is
no persistent mutable state that could share values between uses of the same function.
Thus, a function that produces a fresh reference every time it's called can have a fully
polymorphic type:
# let f () = ref None;;
val f : unit -> 'a option ref = <fun>
But a function that has a mutable cache that persists across calls, like memoize, can
only be weakly polymorphic.
9.8.2
Partial Application and the Value Restriction
Most of the time, when the value restriction kicks in, it's for a good reason, i.e., it's
because the value in question can actually only safely be used with a single type. But
sometimes, the value restriction kicks in when you don't want it. The most common
such case is partially applied functions. A partially applied function, like any function
application, is not a simple value, and as such, functions created by partial application
are sometimes less general than you might expect.
Consider the List.init function, which is used for creating lists where each element
is created by calling a function on the index of that element:

162
Imperative Programming
# List.init;;
- : int -> f:(int -> 'a) -> 'a list = <fun>
# List.init 10 ~f:Int.to_string;;
- : string list = ["0"; "1"; "2"; "3"; "4"; "5"; "6"; "7"; "8"; "9"]
Imagine we wanted to create a specialized version of List.init that always created
lists of length 10. We could do that using partial application, as follows:
# let list_init_10 = List.init 10;;
val list_init_10 : f:(int -> '_weak3) -> '_weak3 list = <fun>
As you can see, we now infer a weakly polymorphic type for the resulting function.
That's because there's nothing that guarantees that List.init isn't creating a persistent
ref somewhere inside of it that would be shared across multiple calls to list_init_10.
We can eliminate this possibility, and at the same time get the compiler to infer a
polymorphic type, by avoiding partial application:
# let list_init_10 ~f = List.init 10 ~f;;
val list_init_10 : f:(int -> 'a) -> 'a list = <fun>
This transformation is referred to as eta expansion and is often useful to resolve
problems that arise from the value restriction.
9.8.3
Relaxing the Value Restriction
OCaml is actually a little better at inferring polymorphic types than was suggested
previously. The value restriction as we described it is basically a syntactic check: you
can do a few operations that count as simple values, and anything that's a simple value
can be generalized.
But OCaml actually has a relaxed version of the value restriction that can make use
of type information to allow polymorphic types for things that are not simple values.
For example, we saw that a function application, even a simple application of the
identity function, is not a simple value and thus can turn a polymorphic value into a
weakly polymorphic one:
# identity (fun x -> [x;x]);;
- : '_weak4 -> '_weak4 list = <fun>
But that's not always the case. When the type of the returned value is immutable,
then OCaml can typically infer a fully polymorphic type:
# identity [];;
- : 'a list = []
On the other hand, if the returned type is mutable, then the result will be weakly
polymorphic:
# [||];;
- : 'a array = [||]
# identity [||];;
- : '_weak5 array = [||]
A more important example of this comes up when dening abstract data types.
Consider the following simple data structure for an immutable list type that supports
constant-time concatenation:

9.8 Relaxing the Value Restriction
163
# module Concat_list : sig
type 'a t
val empty : 'a t
val singleton : 'a -> 'a t
val concat
: 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
(* constant time *)
val to_list : 'a t -> 'a list
(* linear time
*)
end = struct
type 'a t = Empty | Singleton of 'a | Concat of 'a t * 'a t
let empty = Empty
let singleton x = Singleton x
let concat x y = Concat (x,y)
let rec to_list_with_tail t tail =
match t with
| Empty -> tail
| Singleton x -> x :: tail
| Concat (x,y) -> to_list_with_tail x (to_list_with_tail y tail)
let to_list t =
to_list_with_tail t []
end;;
module Concat_list :
sig
type 'a t
val empty : 'a t
val singleton : 'a -> 'a t
val concat : 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
val to_list : 'a t -> 'a list
end
The details of the implementation don't matter so much, but it's important to note
that a Concat_list.t is unquestionably an immutable value. However, when it comes
to the value restriction, OCaml treats it as if it were mutable:
# Concat_list.empty;;
- : 'a Concat_list.t = <abstr>
# identity Concat_list.empty;;
- : '_weak6 Concat_list.t = <abstr>
The issue here is that the signature, by virtue of being abstract, has obscured the fact
that Concat_list.t is in fact an immutable data type. We can resolve this in one of two
ways: either by making the type concrete (i.e., exposing the implementation in the mli),
which is often not desirable; or by marking the type variable in question as covariant.
We'll learn more about covariance and contravariance in Chapter 13 (Objects), but for
now, you can think of it as an annotation that can be put in the interface of a pure data
structure.
In particular, if we replace type 'a t in the interface with type +'a t, that will
make it explicit in the interface that the data structure doesn't contain any persistent
references to values of type 'a, at which point, OCaml can infer polymorphic types for
expressions of this type that are not simple values:
# module Concat_list : sig

164
Imperative Programming
type +'a t
val empty : 'a t
val singleton : 'a -> 'a t
val concat
: 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
(* constant time *)
val to_list : 'a t -> 'a list
(* linear time
*)
end = struct
type 'a t = Empty | Singleton of 'a | Concat of 'a t * 'a t
let empty = Empty
let singleton x = Singleton x
let concat x y = Concat (x,y)
let rec to_list_with_tail t tail =
match t with
| Empty -> tail
| Singleton x -> x :: tail
| Concat (x,y) -> to_list_with_tail x (to_list_with_tail y tail)
let to_list t =
to_list_with_tail t []
end;;
module Concat_list :
sig
type +'a t
val empty : 'a t
val singleton : 'a -> 'a t
val concat : 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
val to_list : 'a t -> 'a list
end
Now, we can apply the identity function to Concat_list.empty without losing any
polymorphism:
# identity Concat_list.empty;;
- : 'a Concat_list.t = <abstr>

Summary
This chapter has covered quite a lot of ground, including:
• Discussing the building blocks of mutable data structures as well as the basic imper-
ative constructs like for loops, while loops, and the sequencing operator ;
• Walking through the implementation of a couple of classic imperative data structures
• Discussing so-called benign eects like memoization and laziness
• Covering OCaml's API for blocking I/O
• Discussing how language-level issues like order of evaluation and weak polymor-
phism interact with OCaml's imperative features
The scope and sophistication of the material here is an indication of the importance
of OCaml's imperative features. The fact that OCaml defaults to immutability shouldn't

obscure the fact that imperative programming is a fundamental part of building any
serious application, and that if you want to be an eective OCaml programmer, you
need to understand OCaml's approach to imperative programming.

10
GADTs
Generalized Algebraic Data Types, or GADTs for short, are an extension of the variants
we sawin Chapter7 (Variants).GADTsaremore expressivethanregularvariants, which
helps you create types that more precisely match the shape of the program you want to
write. That can help you write code that's safer, more concise, and more ecient.
At the same time, GADTs are an advanced feature of OCaml, and their power comes
at a distinct cost. GADTs are harder to use and less intuitive than ordinary variants,
and it can sometimes be a bit of a puzzle to gure out how to use them eectively. All
of which is to say that you should only use a GADT when it makes a big qualitative
improvement to your design.
That said, for the right use-case, GADTs can be really transformative, and this
chapter will walk through several examples that demonstrate the range of use-cases
that GADTs support.
At their heart, GADTs provide two extra features above and beyond ordinary vari-
ants:
• They let the compiler learn more type information when you descend into a case of
a pattern match.
• They make it easy to use existential types, which let you work with data of a specic
but unknown type.
It's a little hard to understand these features without working through some examples,
so we'll do that next.
10.1
A Little Language
One classic use-case for GADTs is for writing typed expression languages, similar
to the boolean expression language described in Chapter 7.3 (Variants and Recursive
Data Structures). In this section, we'll create a slightly richer language that lets us
mix arithmetic and boolean expressions. This means that we have to deal with the
possibility of ill-typed expressions, e.g., an expression that adds a bool and an int.
Let's rst try to do this with an ordinary variant. We'll declare two types here: value,
which represents a primitive value in the language (i.e., an int or a bool), and expr,
which represents the full set of possible expressions.

10.1 Making the Language Type-Safe
167
open Base
type value =
| Int of int
| Bool of bool
type expr =
| Value of value
| Eq of expr * expr
| Plus of expr * expr
| If of expr * expr * expr
We can write a recursive evaluator for this type in a pretty straight-ahead style. First,
we'll declare an exception that can be thrown when we hit an ill-typed expression, e.g.,
when encountering an expression that tries to add a bool and an int.
exception Ill_typed
With that in hand, we can write the evaluator itself.
# let rec eval expr =
match expr with
| Value v -> v
| If (c, t, e) ->
(match eval c with
| Bool b -> if b then eval t else eval e
| Int _ -> raise Ill_typed)
| Eq (x, y) ->
(match eval x, eval y with
| Bool _, _ | _, Bool _ -> raise Ill_typed
| Int f1, Int f2 -> Bool (f1 = f2))
| Plus (x, y) ->
(match eval x, eval y with
| Bool _, _ | _, Bool _ -> raise Ill_typed
| Int f1, Int f2 -> Int (f1 + f2));;
val eval : expr -> value = <fun>
This implementation is a bit ugly because it has a lot of dynamic checks to detect
type errors. Indeed, it's entirely possible to create an ill-typed expression which will
trip these checks.
# let i x = Value (Int x)
and b x = Value (Bool x)
and (+:) x y = Plus (x,y);;
val i : int -> expr = <fun>
val b : bool -> expr = <fun>
val ( +: ) : expr -> expr -> expr = <fun>
# eval (i 3 +: b false);;
Exception: Ill_typed.
This possibility of ill-typed expressions doesn't just complicate the implementation:
it's also a problem for users, since it's all too easy to create ill-typed expressions by
mistake.

168
GADTs
10.1.1
Making the Language Type-Safe
Let's consider what a type-safe version of this API might look like in the absence of
GADTs. To even express the type constraints, we'll need expressions to have a type
parameter to distinguish integer expressions from boolean expressions. Given such a
parameter, the signature for such a language might look like this.
module type Typesafe_lang_sig = sig
type 'a t
(** functions for constructing expressions *)
val int : int -> int t
val bool : bool -> bool t
val if_ : bool t -> 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
val eq : 'a t -> 'a t -> bool t
val plus : int t -> int t -> int t
(** Evaluation functions *)
val int_eval : int t -> int
val bool_eval : bool t -> bool
end
The functions int_eval and bool_eval deserve some explanation. You might expect
there to be a single evaluation function, with this signature.
val eval : 'a t -> 'a
But as we'll see, we're not going to be able to implement that, at least, not without
using GADTs. So for now, we're stuck with two dierent evaluators, one for each type
of expression.
Now let's write an implementation that matches this signature.
module Typesafe_lang : Typesafe_lang_sig = struct
type 'a t = expr
let int x = Value (Int x)
let bool x = Value (Bool x)
let if_ c t e = If (c, t, e)
let eq x y = Eq (x, y)
let plus x y = Plus (x, y)
let int_eval expr =
match eval expr with
| Int x -> x
| Bool _ -> raise Ill_typed
let bool_eval expr =
match eval expr with
| Bool x -> x
| Int _ -> raise Ill_typed
end
As you can see, the ill-typed expression we had trouble with before can't be con-
structed, because it's rejected by OCaml's type-system.

10.1 Trying to Do Better with Ordinary Variants
169
# let expr = Typesafe_lang.(plus (int 3) (bool false));;
Line 1, characters 40-52:
Error: This expression has type bool t but an expression was expected
of type
int t
Type bool is not compatible with type int
So, what happened here? How did we add the type-safety we wanted? The funda-
mental trick is to add what's called a phantom type. In this denition:
type 'a t = expr
the type parameter 'a is the phantom type, since it doesn't show up in the body of the
denition of t.
Because the type parameter is unused, it's free to take on any value. That means
we can constrain the use of that type parameter arbitrarily in the signature, which is a
freedom we use to add the type-safety rules that we wanted.
This all amounts to an improvement in terms of the API, but the implementation is
if anything worse. We still have the same evaluator with all of its dynamic checking
for type errors. But we've had to write yet more wrapper code to make this work.
Also, the phantom-type discipline is quite error prone. You might have missed the
fact that the type on the eq function above is wrong!
# Typesafe_lang.eq;;
- : 'a Typesafe_lang.t -> 'a Typesafe_lang.t -> bool Typesafe_lang.t =
<fun>
It looks like it's polymorphic over the type of expressions, but the evaluator only
supports checking equality on integers. As a result, we can still construct an ill-typed
expression, phantom-types notwithstanding.
# let expr = Typesafe_lang.(eq (bool true) (bool false));;
val expr : bool Typesafe_lang.t = <abstr>
# Typesafe_lang.bool_eval expr;;
Exception: Ill_typed.
This highlights why we still need the dynamic checks in the implementation: the
types within the implementation don't necessarily rule out ill-typed expressions. The
same fact explains why we needed two dierent eval functions: the implementation
of eval doesn't have any type-level guarantee of when it's handling a bool expression
versus an int expression, so it can't safely give results where the type of the result varies
based on the result of the expression.
10.1.2
Trying to Do Better with Ordinary Variants
To see why we need GADTs, let's see how far we can get without them. In particular,
let's see what happens when we try to encode the typing rules we want for our DSL
directly into the denition of the expression type. We'll do that by putting an ordinary
type parameter on our expr and value types, in order to represent the type of an
expression or value.

170
GADTs
type 'a value =
| Int of 'a
| Bool of 'a
type 'a expr =
| Value of 'a value
| Eq of 'a expr * 'a expr
| Plus of 'a expr * 'a expr
| If of bool expr * 'a expr * 'a expr
This looks promising at rst, but it doesn't quite do what we want. Let's experiment a
little.
# let i x = Value (Int x)
and b x = Value (Bool x)
and (+:) x y = Plus (x,y);;
val i : 'a -> 'a expr = <fun>
val b : 'a -> 'a expr = <fun>
val ( +: ) : 'a expr -> 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
# i 3;;
- : int expr = Value (Int 3)
# b false;;
- : bool expr = Value (Bool false)
# i 3 +: i 4;;
- : int expr = Plus (Value (Int 3), Value (Int 4))
So far so good. But if you think about it for a minute, you'll realize this doesn't
actually do what we want. For one thing, the type of the outer expression is always just
equal to the type of the inner expression, which means that some things that should
type-check don't.
# If (Eq (i 3, i 4), i 0, i 1);;
Line 1, characters 9-12:
Error: This expression has type int expr
but an expression was expected of type bool expr
Type int is not compatible with type bool
Also, some things that shouldn't typecheck do.
# b 3;;
- : int expr = Value (Bool 3)
The problem here is that the way we want to use the type parameter isn't supported
by ordinary variants. In particular, we want the type parameter to be populated in
dierent ways in the dierent tags, and to depend in non-trivial ways on the types of
the data associated with each tag. That's where GADTs can help.
10.1.3
GADTs to the Rescue
Now we're ready to write our rst GADT. Here's a new version of our value and expr
types that correctly encode our desired typing rules.
type _ value =
| Int : int -> int value
| Bool : bool -> bool value

10.1 GADTs to the Rescue
171
type _ expr =
| Value : 'a value -> 'a expr
| Eq : int expr * int expr -> bool expr
| Plus : int expr * int expr -> int expr
| If : bool expr * 'a expr * 'a expr -> 'a expr
The syntax here requires some decoding. The colon to the right of each tag is what
tells you that this is a GADT. To the right of the colon, you'll see what looks like
an ordinary, single-argument function type, and you can almost think of it that way;
specically, as the type signature for that particular tag, viewed as a type constructor.
The left-hand side of the arrow states the types of the arguments to the constructor, and
the right-hand side determines the type of the constructed value.
In the denition of each tag in a GADT, the right-hand side of the arrow is an instance
of the type of the overall GADT, with independent choices for the type parameter in
each case. Importantly, the type parameter can depend both on the tag and on the type
of the arguments. Eq is an example where the type parameter is determined entirely
by the tag: it always corresponds to a bool expr. If is an example where the type
parameter depends on the arguments to the tag, in particular the type parameter of the
If is the type parameter of the then and else clauses.
Let's try some examples.
# let i x = Value (Int x)
and b x = Value (Bool x)
and (+:) x y = Plus (x,y);;
val i : int -> int expr = <fun>
val b : bool -> bool expr = <fun>
val ( +: ) : int expr -> int expr -> int expr = <fun>
# i 3;;
- : int expr = Value (Int 3)
# b 3;;
Line 1, characters 3-4:
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of
type
bool
# i 3 +: i 6;;
- : int expr = Plus (Value (Int 3), Value (Int 6))
# i 3 +: b false;;
Line 1, characters 8-15:
Error: This expression has type bool expr
but an expression was expected of type int expr
Type bool is not compatible with type int
What we see here is that the type-safety rules we previously enforced with signature-
level restrictions on phantom types are now directly encoded in the denition of the
expression type.
These type-safety rules apply not just when constructing an expression, but also
when deconstructing one, which means we can write a simpler and more concise
evaluator that doesn't need any type-safety checks.
# let eval_value : type a. a value -> a = function
| Int x -> x

172
GADTs
| Bool x -> x;;
val eval_value : 'a value -> 'a = <fun>
# let rec eval : type a. a expr -> a = function
| Value v -> eval_value v
| If (c, t, e) -> if eval c then eval t else eval e
| Eq (x, y) -> eval x = eval y
| Plus (x, y) -> eval x + eval y;;
val eval : 'a expr -> 'a = <fun>
Note that we now have a single polymorphic eval function, as opposed to the two
type-specic evaluators we needed when using phantom types.
10.1.4
GADTs, Locally Abstract Types, and Polymorphic Recursion
The above example lets us see one of the downsides of GADTs, which is that code using
them needs extra type annotations. Look at what happens if we write the denition of
value without the annotation.
# let eval_value = function
| Int x -> x
| Bool x -> x;;
Line 3, characters 7-13:
Error: This pattern matches values of type bool value
but a pattern was expected which matches values of type int
value
Type bool is not compatible with type int
The issue here is that OCaml by default isn't willing to instantiate ordinary type
variables in dierent ways in the body of the same function, which is what is required
here. We can x that by adding a locally abstract type, which doesn't have that
restriction.
# let eval_value (type a) (v : a value) : a =
match v with
| Int x -> x
| Bool x -> x;;
val eval_value : 'a value -> 'a = <fun>
This isn't the same annotation we wrote earlier, and indeed, if we try this approach
with eval, we'll see that it doesn't work.
# let rec eval (type a) (e : a expr) : a =
match e with
| Value v -> eval_value v
| If (c, t, e) -> if eval c then eval t else eval e
| Eq (x, y) -> eval x = eval y
| Plus (x, y) -> eval x + eval y;;
Line 4, characters 43-44:
Error: This expression has type a expr but an expression was expected
of type
bool expr
The type constructor a would escape its scope
This is a pretty unhelpful error message, but the basic problem is that eval is recursive,
and inference of GADTs doesn't play well with recursive calls.

10.2 Varying Your Return Type
173
More specically, the issue is that the type-checker is trying to merge the locally
abstract type a into the type of the recursive function eval, and merging it into the
outer scope within which eval is dened is the way in which a is escaping its scope.
We can x this by explicitly marking eval as polymorphic, which OCaml has a
handy type annotation for.
# let rec eval : 'a. 'a expr -> 'a =
fun (type a) (x : a expr) ->
match x with
| Value v -> eval_value v
| If (c, t, e) -> if eval c then eval t else eval e
| Eq (x, y) -> eval x = eval y
| Plus (x, y) -> eval x + eval y;;
val eval : 'a expr -> 'a = <fun>
This works because by marking eval as polymorphic, the type of eval isn't specialized
to a, and so a doesn't escape its scope.
It's also helpful here because eval itself is an example of polymorphic recursion,
which is to say that eval needs to call itself at multiple dierent types. This comes
up, for example, with If, since the If itself must be of type bool, but the type of the
then and else clauses could be of type int. This means that when evaluating If, we'll
dispatch eval at a dierent type than it was called on.
As such, eval needs to see itself as polymorphic. This kind of polymorphism
is basically impossible to infer automatically, which is a second reason we need to
annotate eval's polymorphism explicitly.
The above syntax is a bit verbose, so OCaml has syntactic sugar to combine the
polymorphism annotation and the creation of the locally abstract types:
# let rec eval : type a. a expr -> a = function
| Value v -> eval_value v
| If (c, t, e) -> if eval c then eval t else eval e
| Eq (x, y) -> eval x = eval y
| Plus (x, y) -> eval x + eval y;;
val eval : 'a expr -> 'a = <fun>
This type of annotation is the right one to pick when you write any recursive function
that makes use of GADTs.
10.2
When Are GADTs Useful?
The typed language we showed above is a perfectly reasonable example, but GADTs
are useful for a lot more than designing little languages. In this section, we'll try to
give you a broader sampling of the kinds of things you can do with GADTs.
10.2.1
Varying Your Return Type
Sometimes, you want to write a single function that can eectively have dierent types
in dierent circumstances. In some sense, this is totally ordinary. After all, OCaml's

174
GADTs
polymorphism means that values can take on dierent types in dierent contexts.
List.find is a ne example. The signature indicates that the type of the result varies
with the type of the input list.
# List.find;;
- : 'a list -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a option = <fun>
And of course you can use List.find to produce values of dierent types.
# List.find ~f:(fun x -> x > 3) [1;3;5;2];;
- : int option = Some 5
# List.find ~f:(Char.is_uppercase) ['a';'B';'C'];;
- : char option = Some B
But this approach is limited to simple dependencies between types that correspond
to how data ows through your code. Sometimes you want types to vary in a more
exible way.
To make this concrete, let's say we wanted to create a version of find that is
congurable in terms of how it handles the case of not nding an item. There are three
dierent behaviors you might want:
• Throw an exception.
• Return None.
• Return a default value.
Let's try to write a function that exhibits these behaviors without using GADTs.
First, we'll create a variant type that represents the three possible behaviors.
module If_not_found = struct
type 'a t =
| Raise
| Return_none
| Default_to of 'a
end
Now we can write flexible_find, which takes an If_not_found.t as a parameter
and varies its behavior accordingly.
# let rec flexible_find list ~f (if_not_found : _ If_not_found.t) =
match list with
| hd :: tl ->
if f hd then Some hd else flexible_find ~f tl if_not_found
| [] ->
(match if_not_found with
| Raise -> failwith "Element not found"
| Return_none -> None
| Default_to x -> Some x);;
val flexible_find :
'a list -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a If_not_found.t -> 'a option = <fun>
Here are some examples of the above function in action:
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;5] Return_none;;
- : int option = None
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;5] (Default_to 10);;
- : int option = Some 10

10.2 Varying Your Return Type
175
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;5] Raise;;
Exception: (Failure "Element not found")
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;20] Raise;;
- : int option = Some 20
This mostly does what we want, but the problem is that flexible_find always
returns an option, even when it's passed Raise or Default_to, which guarantees that
the None case is never used.
To eliminate the unnecessary option in the Raise and Default_to cases, we're going
to turn If_not_found.t into a GADT. In particular, we'll mint it as a GADT with two
type parameters: one for the type of the list element, and one for the return type of the
function.
module If_not_found = struct
type (_, _) t =
| Raise : ('a, 'a) t
| Return_none : ('a, 'a option) t
| Default_to : 'a -> ('a, 'a) t
end
As you can see, Raise and Default_to both have the same element type and return
type, but Return_none provides an optional return value.
Here's a denition of flexible_find that takes advantage of this GADT.
# let rec flexible_find
: type a b. f:(a -> bool) -> a list -> (a, b) If_not_found.t -> b =
fun ~f list if_not_found ->
match list with
| [] ->
(match if_not_found with
| Raise -> failwith "No matching item found"
| Return_none -> None
| Default_to x -> x)
| hd :: tl ->
if f hd
then (
match if_not_found with
| Raise -> hd
| Return_none -> Some hd
| Default_to _ -> hd)
else flexible_find ~f tl if_not_found;;
val flexible_find :
f:('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> ('a, 'b) If_not_found.t -> 'b = <fun>
As you can see from the signature of flexible_find, the return value now depends
on the type of If_not_found.t, which means it can depend on the particular variant of
If_not_found.t that's in use. As a result, flexible_find only returns an option when
it needs to.
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;5] Return_none;;
- : int option = Base.Option.None
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;5] (Default_to 10);;
- : int = 10
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;5] Raise;;
Exception: (Failure "No matching item found")

176
GADTs
# flexible_find ~f:(fun x -> x > 10) [1;2;20] Raise;;
- : int = 20
10.2.2
Capturing the Unknown
Code that works with unknown types is routine in OCaml, and comes up in the simplest
of examples:
# let tuple x y = (x,y);;
val tuple : 'a -> 'b -> 'a * 'b = <fun>
The type variables 'a and 'b indicate that there are two unknown types here, and
these type variables are universally quantied. Which is to say, the type of tuple is:
for all types a and b, a -> b -> a * b.
And indeed, we can restrict the type of tuple to any 'a and 'b we want.
# (tuple : int -> float -> int * float);;
- : int -> float -> int * float = <fun>
# (tuple : string -> string * string -> string * (string * string));;
- : string -> string * string -> string * (string * string) = <fun>
Sometimes, however, we want type variables that are existentially quantied, mean-
ing that instead of being compatible with all types, the type represents a particular but
unknown type.
GADTs provide one natural way of encoding such type variables. Here's a simple
example.
type stringable =
Stringable : { value: 'a; to_string: 'a -> string } -> stringable
This type packs together a value of some arbitrary type, along with a function for
converting values of that type to strings.
We can tell that 'a is existentially quantied because it shows up on the left-hand
side of the arrow but not on the right, so the 'a that shows up internally doesn't appear
in a type parameter for stringable itself. Essentially, the existentially quantied type
is bound within the denition of stringable.
The following function can print an arbitrary stringable:
# let print_stringable (Stringable s) =
Stdio.print_endline (s.to_string s.value);;
val print_stringable : stringable -> unit = <fun>
We can use print_stringable on a collection of stringables of dierent underlying
types.
# let stringables =
(let s value to_string = Stringable { to_string; value } in
[ s 100 Int.to_string
; s 12.3 Float.to_string
; s "foo" Fn.id
]);;
val stringables : stringable list =
[Stringable {value = <poly>; to_string = <fun>};

10.2 Abstracting Computational Machines
177
Stringable {value = <poly>; to_string = <fun>};
Stringable {value = <poly>; to_string = <fun>}]
# List.iter ~f:print_stringable stringables;;
100
12.3
foo
- : unit = ()
The thing that lets this all work is that the type of the underlying object is existentially
bound within the type stringable. As such, the type of the underlying values can't
escape the scope of stringable, and any function that tries to return such a value won't
type-check.
# let get_value (Stringable s) = s.value;;
Line 1, characters 32-39:
Error: This expression has type $Stringable_'a
but an expression was expected of type 'a
The type constructor $Stringable_'a would escape its scope
It's worth spending a moment to decode this error message, and the meaning of the
type variable $Stringable_'a in particular. You can think of this variable as having
three parts:
• The $ marks the variable as an existential.
• Stringable is the name of the GADT tag that this variable came from.
• 'a is the name of the type variable from inside that tag.
10.2.3
Abstracting Computational Machines
A common idiom in OCaml is to combine small components into larger computational
machines, using a collection of component-combining functions, or combinators.
GADTs can be helpful for writing such combinators. To see how, let's consider an
example: pipelines. Here, a pipeline is a sequence of steps where each step consumes
the output of the previous step, potentially does some side eects, and returns a value
to be passed to the next step. This is analogous to a shell pipeline, and is useful for all
sorts of system automation tasks.
But, can't we write pipelines already? After all, OCaml comes with a perfectly
serviceable pipeline operator:
# open Core;;
# let sum_file_sizes () =
Sys.ls_dir "."
|> List.filter ~f:Sys.is_file_exn
|> List.map ~f:(fun file_name -> (Unix.lstat file_name).st_size)
|> List.sum (module Int) ~f:Int64.to_int_exn;;
val sum_file_sizes : unit -> int = <fun>
This works well enough, but the advantage of a custom pipeline type is that it lets you
build extra services beyond basic execution of the pipeline, e.g.:
• Proling, so that when you run a pipeline, you get a report of how long each step of
the pipeline took.

178
GADTs
• Control over execution, like allowing users to pause the pipeline mid-execution, and
restart it later.
• Custom error handling, so, for example, you could build a pipeline that kept track of
where it failed, and oered the possibility of restarting it.
The type signature of such a pipeline type might look something like this:
module type Pipeline = sig
type ('input,'output) t
val ( @> ) : ('a -> 'b) -> ('b,'c) t -> ('a,'c) t
val empty : ('a,'a) t
end
Here, the type ('a,'b) t represents a pipeline that consumes values of type 'a and
emits values of type 'b. The operator @> lets you add a step to a pipeline by providing a
function to prepend on to an existing pipeline, and empty gives you an empty pipeline,
which can be used to seed the pipeline.
The following shows how we could use this API for building a pipeline like our
earlier example using |>. Here, we're using a functor, which we'll see in more detail
in Chapter 11 (Functors), as a way to write code using the pipeline API before we've
implemented it.
# module Example_pipeline (Pipeline : Pipeline) = struct
open Pipeline
let sum_file_sizes =
(fun () -> Sys.ls_dir ".")
@> List.filter ~f:Sys.is_file_exn
@> List.map ~f:(fun file_name -> (Unix.lstat file_name).st_size)
@> List.sum (module Int) ~f:Int64.to_int_exn
@> empty
end;;
module Example_pipeline :
functor (Pipeline : Pipeline) ->
sig val sum_file_sizes : (unit, int) Pipeline.t end
If all we want is a pipeline capable of a no-frills execution, we can dene our pipeline
itself as a simple function, the @> operator as function composition. Then executing
the pipeline is just function application.
module Basic_pipeline : sig
include Pipeline
val exec : ('a,'b) t -> 'a -> 'b
end= struct
type ('input, 'output) t = 'input -> 'output
let empty = Fn.id
let ( @> ) f t input =
t (f input)
let exec t input = t input
end
But this way of implementing a pipeline doesn't give us any of the extra services we

10.2 Abstracting Computational Machines
179
discussed. All we're really doing is step-by-step building up the same kind of function
that we could have gotten using the |> operator.
We could get a more powerful pipeline by simply enhancing the pipeline type, pro-
viding it with extra runtime structures to track proles, or handle exceptions, or provide
whatever else is needed for the particular use-case. But this approach is awkward, since
it requires us to pre-commit to whatever services we're going to support, and to embed
all of them in our pipeline representation.
GADTs provide a simpler approach. Instead of concretely building a machine for
executing a pipeline, we can use GADTs to abstractly represent the pipeline we want,
and then build the functionality we want on top of that representation.
Here's what such a representation might look like.
type (_, _) pipeline =
| Step : ('a -> 'b) * ('b, 'c) pipeline -> ('a, 'c) pipeline
| Empty : ('a, 'a) pipeline
The tags here represent the two building blocks of a pipeline: Step corresponds to
the @> operator, and Empty corresponds to the empty pipeline, as you can see below.
# let ( @> ) f pipeline = Step (f,pipeline);;
val ( @> ) : ('a -> 'b) -> ('b, 'c) pipeline -> ('a, 'c) pipeline = <fun>
# let empty = Empty;;
val empty : ('a, 'a) pipeline = Empty
With that in hand, we can do a no-frills pipeline execution easily enough.
# let rec exec : type a b. (a, b) pipeline -> a -> b =
fun pipeline input ->
match pipeline with
| Empty -> input
| Step (f, tail) -> exec tail (f input);;
val exec : ('a, 'b) pipeline -> 'a -> 'b = <fun>
But we can also do more interesting things. For example, here's a function that
executes a pipeline and produces a prole showing how long each step of a pipeline
took.
# let exec_with_profile pipeline input =
let rec loop
: type a b.
(a, b) pipeline -> a -> Time_ns.Span.t list -> b *
Time_ns.Span.t list
=
fun pipeline input rev_profile ->
match pipeline with
| Empty -> input, rev_profile
| Step (f, tail) ->
let start = Time_ns.now () in
let output = f input in
let elapsed = Time_ns.diff (Time_ns.now ()) start in
loop tail output (elapsed :: rev_profile)
in
let output, rev_profile = loop pipeline input [] in
output, List.rev rev_profile;;

180
GADTs
val exec_with_profile : ('a, 'b) pipeline -> 'a -> 'b * Time_ns.Span.t
list =
<fun>
The more abstract GADT approach for creating a little combinator library like this
has several advantages over having combinators that build a more concrete computa-
tional machine:
• The core types are simpler, since they are typically built out of GADT tags that are
just reections of the types of the base combinators.
• The design is more modular, since your core types don't need to contemplate every
possible use you want to make of them.
• The code tends to be more ecient, since the more concrete approach typically
involves allocating closures to wrap up the necessary functionality, and closures
are more heavyweight than GADT tags.
10.2.4
Narrowing the Possibilities
Another use-case for GADTs is to narrow the set of possible states for a given data-type
in dierent circumstances.
One context where this can be useful is when managing complex application state,
where the available data changes over time. Let's consider a simple example, where
we're writing code to handle a logon request from a user, and we want to check if the
user in question is authorized to logon.
We'll assume that the user logging in is authenticated as a particular name, but that
in order to authenticate, we need to do two things: to translate that user-name into a
numeric user-id, and to fetch permissions for the service in question; once we have
both, we can check if the user-id is permitted to log on.
Without GADTs, we might model the state of a single logon request as follows.
type logon_request =
{ user_name : User_name.t
; user_id : User_id.t option
; permissions : Permissions.t option
}
Here, User_name.t represents a textual name, User_id.t represents an integer identi-
er associated with a user, and a Permissions.t lets you determine which User_id.t's
are authorized to log in.
Here's how we might write a function for testing whether a given request is autho-
rized.
# let authorized request =
match request.user_id, request.permissions with
| None, _ | _, None ->
Error "Can't check authorization: data incomplete"
| Some user_id, Some permissions ->
Ok (Permissions.check permissions user_id);;
val authorized : logon_request -> (bool, string) result = <fun>

10.2 A Completion-Sensitive Option Type
181
The intent is to only call this function once the data is complete, i.e., when the user_id
and permissions elds have been lled in, which is why it errors out if the data is
incomplete.
The code above works just ne for a simple case like this. But in a real system, your
code can get more complicated in multiple ways, e.g.,
• more elds to manage, including more optional elds,
• more operations that depend on these optional elds,
• multiple requests to be handled in parallel, each of which might be in a dierent
state of completion.
As this kind of complexity creeps in, it can be useful to be able to track the state of a
given request at the type level, and to use that to narrow the set of states a given request
can be in, thereby removing some extra case analysis and error handling, which can
reduce the complexity of the code and remove opportunities for mistakes.
One way of doing this is to mint dierent types to represent dierent states of the
request, e.g., one type for an incomplete request where various elds are optional, and
a dierent type where all of the data is mandatory.
While this works, it can be awkward and verbose. With GADTs, we can track the
state of the request in a type parameter, and have that parameter be used to narrow the
set of available cases, without duplicating the type.
A Completion-Sensitive Option Type
We'll start by creating an option type that is sensitive to whether our request is in a
complete or incomplete state. To do that, we'll mint types to represent the states of
being complete and incomplete.
type incomplete = Incomplete
type complete = Complete
The denition of the types doesn't really matter, since we're never instantiating these
types, just using them as markers of dierent states. All that matters is that the types
are distinct.
Now we can mint a completeness-sensitive option type. Note the two type variables:
the rst indicates the type of the contents of the option, and the second indicates
whether this is being used in an incomplete state.
type (_, _) coption =
| Absent : (_, incomplete) coption
| Present : 'a -> ('a, _) coption
We use Absent and Present rather than Some or None to make the code less confusing
when both option and coption are used together.
You might notice that we haven't used complete here explicitly. Instead, what we've
done is to ensure that only an incomplete coption can be Absent. Accordingly, a
coption that's complete (and therefore not incomplete) can only be Present.
This is easier to understand with some examples. Consider the following function
for getting the value out of a coption, returning a default value if Absent is found.

182
GADTs
# let get ~default o =
match o with
| Present x -> x
| Absent -> default;;
val get : default:'a -> ('a, incomplete) coption -> 'a = <fun>
Note that the incomplete type was inferred here. If we annotate the coption as
complete, the code no longer compiles.
# let get ~default (o : (_,complete) coption) =
match o with
| Absent -> default
| Present x -> x;;
Line 3, characters 7-13:
Error: This pattern matches values of type ('a, incomplete) coption
but a pattern was expected which matches values of type
('a, complete) coption
Type incomplete is not compatible with type complete
We can make this compile by deleting the Absent branch (and the now useless
default argument).
# let get (o : (_,complete) coption) =
match o with
| Present x -> x;;
val get : ('a, complete) coption -> 'a = <fun>
We could write this more simply as:
# let get (Present x : (_,complete) coption) = x;;
val get : ('a, complete) coption -> 'a = <fun>
As we can see, when the coption is known to be complete, the pattern matching is
narrowed to just the Present case.
A Completion-Sensitive Request Type
We can use coption to dene a completion-sensitive version of logon_request.
type 'c logon_request =
{ user_name : User_name.t
; user_id : (User_id.t, 'c) coption
; permissions : (Permissions.t, 'c) coption
}
There's a single type parameter for the logon_request that marks whether it's
complete, at which point, both the user_id and permissions elds will be complete
as well.
As before, it's easy to ll in the user_id and permissions elds.
# let set_user_id request x = { request with user_id = Present x };;
val set_user_id : 'a logon_request -> User_id.t -> 'a logon_request =
<fun>
# let set_permissions request x = { request with permissions =
Present x };;
val set_permissions : 'a logon_request -> Permissions.t -> 'a
logon_request =
<fun>

10.2 Type Distinctness and Abstraction
183
Note that lling in the elds doesn't automatically mark a request as complete. To
do that, we need to explicitly test for completeness, and then construct a version of the
record with just the completed elds lled in.
# let check_completeness request =
match request.user_id, request.permissions with
| Absent, _ | _, Absent -> None
| (Present _ as user_id), (Present _ as permissions) ->
Some { request with user_id; permissions };;
val check_completeness : incomplete logon_request -> 'a logon_request
option =
<fun>
The result is polymorphic, meaning it can return a logon request of any kind, which
includes the possibility of returning a complete request. In practice, the function type
is easier to understand if we constrain the return value to explicitly return a complete
request.
# let check_completeness request : complete logon_request option =
match request.user_id, request.permissions with
| Absent, _ | _, Absent -> None
| (Present _ as user_id), (Present _ as permissions) ->
Some { request with user_id; permissions };;
val check_completeness :
incomplete logon_request -> complete logon_request option = <fun>
Finally, we can write an authorization checker that works unconditionally on a
complete login request.
# let authorized (request : complete logon_request) =
let { user_id = Present user_id; permissions = Present
permissions; _ } = request in
Permissions.check permissions user_id;;
val authorized : complete logon_request -> bool = <fun>
After all that work, the result may seem a bit underwhelming, and indeed, most
of the time, this kind of narrowing isn't worth the complexity of setting it up. But
for a suciently complex state machine, cutting down on the possibilities that your
code needs to contemplate can make a big dierence to the comprehensibility and
correctness of the result.
Type Distinctness and Abstraction
In the example in this section, we used two types, complete and incomplete to mark
dierent states, and we dened those types so as to be in some sense obviously dierent.
type incomplete = Incomplete
type complete = Complete
This isn't strictly necessary. Here's another way of dening these types that makes
them less obviously distinct.
type incomplete = Z
type complete = Z

184
GADTs
OCaml's variant types are nominal, so complete and incomplete are distinct types,
despite having variants of the same name, as you can see when we try to put instances
of each type in the same list.
# let i = (Z : incomplete) and c = (Z : complete);;
val i : incomplete = Z
val c : complete = Z
# [i; c];;
Line 1, characters 5-6:
Error: This expression has type complete
but an expression was expected of type incomplete
As a result, we can narrow a pattern match using these types as indices, much as we
did earlier. First, we set up the coption type:
type ('a, _) coption =
| Absent : (_, incomplete) coption
| Present : 'a -> ('a, _) coption
Then, we write a function that requires the coption to be complete, and accordingly,
need only contemplate the Present case.
# let assume_complete (coption : (_,complete) coption) =
match coption with
| Present x -> x;;
val assume_complete : ('a, complete) coption -> 'a = <fun>
An easy-to-miss issue here is that the way we expose these types through an interface
can cause OCaml to lose track of the distinctness of the types in question. Consider
this version, where we entirely hide the denition of complete and incomplete.
module M : sig
type incomplete
type complete
end = struct
type incomplete = Z
type complete = Z
end
include M
type ('a, _) coption =
| Absent : (_, incomplete) coption
| Present : 'a -> ('a, _) coption
Now, the assume_complete function we wrote is no longer found to be exhaustive.
# let assume_complete (coption : (_,complete) coption) =
match coption with
| Present x -> x;;
Lines 2-3, characters 5-21:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
Absent
val assume_complete : ('a, complete) coption -> 'a = <fun>
That's because by leaving the types abstract, we've entirely hidden the underlying
types, leaving the type system with no evidence that the types are distinct.
Let's see what happens if we expose the implementation of these types.

10.2 Narrowing Without GADTs
185
module M : sig
type incomplete = Z
type complete = Z
end = struct
type incomplete = Z
type complete = Z
end
include M
type ('a, _) coption =
| Absent : (_, incomplete) coption
| Present : 'a -> ('a, _) coption
But the result is still not exhaustive!
# let assume_complete (coption : (_,complete) coption) =
match coption with
| Present x -> x;;
Lines 2-3, characters 5-21:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
Absent
val assume_complete : ('a, complete) coption -> 'a = <fun>
In order to be exhaustive, we need the types that are exposed to be denitively
dierent, which would be the case if we dened them as variants with dierently
named tags, as we did originally.
The reason for this is that types that appear to be dierent in an interface may turn
out to be the same in the implementation, as we can see below.
module M : sig
type incomplete = Z
type complete = Z
end = struct
type incomplete = Z
type complete = incomplete = Z
end
All of which is to say: when creating types to act as abstract markers for the type
parameter of a GADT, you should choose denitions that make the distinctness of
those types clear, and you should expose those denitions in your mlis.
Narrowing Without GADTs
Thus far, we've only seen narrowing in the context of GADTs, but OCaml can eliminate
impossible cases from ordinary variants too. As with GADTs, to eliminate a case you
need to demonstrate that the case in question is impossible at the type level.
One way to do this is via an uninhabited type, which is a type that has no associated
values. You can declare such a value by creating a variant with no tags.
type nothing = |
This turns out to be useful enough that Base has a standard uninhabited type, Nothing.t.
So, how does an uninhabited type help? Well, consider the Result.t type, discussed

186
GADTs
in as described in Chapter 8.1.1 (Encoding Errors with Result). Normally, to match a
Result.t, you need to handle both the Ok and Error cases.
# open Stdio;;
# let print_result (x : (int,string) Result.t) =
match x with
| Ok x -> printf "%d\n" x
| Error x -> printf "ERROR: %s\n" x;;
val print_result : (int, string) result -> unit = <fun>
But if the Error case contains an uninhabitable type, well, that case can never be
instantiated, and OCaml will tell you as much.
# let print_result (x : (int, Nothing.t) Result.t) =
match x with
| Ok x -> printf "%d\n" x
| Error _ -> printf "ERROR\n";;
Line 4, characters 7-14:
Warning 56 [unreachable-case]: this match case is unreachable.
Consider replacing it with a refutation case '<pat> -> .'
val print_result : (int, Nothing.t) result -> unit = <fun>
We can follow the advice above, and add a so-called refutation case.
# let print_result (x : (int, Nothing.t) Result.t) =
match x with
| Ok x -> printf "%d\n" x
| Error _ -> .;;
val print_result : (int, Nothing.t) result -> unit = <fun>
The period in the nal case tells the compiler that we believe this case can never
be reached, and OCaml will verify that it's true. In some simple cases, however, the
compiler can automatically add the refutation case for you, so you don't need to write
it out explicitly.
# let print_result (x : (int, Nothing.t) Result.t) =
match x with
| Ok x -> printf "%d\n" x;;
val print_result : (int, Nothing.t) result -> unit = <fun>
Narrowing with uninhabitable types can be useful when using a highly congurable
library that supports multiple dierent modes of use, not all of which are necessarily
needed for a given application. One example of this comes from Async's RPC (remote
procedure-call) library. Async RPCs support a particular avor of interaction called
a State_rpc. Such an RPC is parameterized by four types, for four dierent kinds of
data:
• query, for the initial client request,
• state, for the initial snapshot returned by the server,
• update, for the sequence of updates to that snapshot, and
• error, for an error to terminate the stream.
Now, imagine you want to use a State_rpc in a context where you don't need to
terminate the stream with a custom error. We could just instantiate the State_rpc using
the type unit for the error type.

10.3 Or-Patterns
187
open Core
open Async
let rpc =
Rpc.State_rpc.create
~name:"int-map"
~version:1
~bin_query:[%bin_type_class: unit]
~bin_state:[%bin_type_class: int Map.M(String).t]
~bin_update:[%bin_type_class: int Map.M(String).t]
~bin_error:[%bin_type_class: unit]
()
But with this approach, you still have to handle the error case when writing code to
dispatch the RPC.
# let dispatch conn =
match%bind Rpc.State_rpc.dispatch rpc conn () >>| ok_exn with
| Ok (initial_state, updates, _) -> handle_state_changes
initial_state updates
| Error () -> failwith "this is not supposed to happen";;
val dispatch : Rpc.Connection.t -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
An alternative approach is to use an uninhabited type for the error:
let rpc =
Rpc.State_rpc.create
~name:"foo"
~version:1
~bin_query:[%bin_type_class: unit]
~bin_state:[%bin_type_class: int Map.M(String).t]
~bin_update:[%bin_type_class: int Map.M(String).t]
~bin_error:[%bin_type_class: Nothing.t]
()
Now, we've essentially banned the use of the error type, and as a result, our dispatch
function needs only deal with the Ok case.
# let dispatch conn =
match%bind Rpc.State_rpc.dispatch rpc conn () >>| ok_exn with
| Ok (initial_state, updates, _) -> handle_state_changes
initial_state updates;;
val dispatch : Rpc.Connection.t -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
What's nice about this example is that it shows that narrowing can be applied to
code that isn't designed with narrowing in mind.
10.3
Limitations of GADTs
Hopefully, we've demonstrated the utility of GADTs, while at the same time showing
some of the attendant complexities. In this nal section, we're going to highlight some
remaining diculties with using GADTs that you may run into, as well as how to work
around them.

188
GADTs
10.3.1
Or-Patterns
GADTs don't work well with or-patterns. Consider the following type that represents
various ways we might use for obtaining some piece of data.
open Core
module Source_kind = struct
type _ t =
| Filename : string t
| Host_and_port : Host_and_port.t t
| Raw_data : string t
end
We can write a function that takes a Source_kind.t and the corresponding source,
and prints it out.
# let source_to_sexp (type a) (kind : a Source_kind.t) (source : a) =
match kind with
| Filename -> String.sexp_of_t source
| Host_and_port -> Host_and_port.sexp_of_t source
| Raw_data -> String.sexp_of_t source;;
val source_to_sexp : 'a Source_kind.t -> 'a -> Sexp.t = <fun>
But, observing that the right-hand side of Raw_data and Filename are the same, you
might try to merge those cases together with an or-pattern. Unfortunately, that doesn't
work.
# let source_to_sexp (type a) (kind : a Source_kind.t) (source : a) =
match kind with
| Filename | Raw_data -> String.sexp_of_t source
| Host_and_port -> Host_and_port.sexp_of_t source;;
Line 3, characters 47-53:
Error: This expression has type a but an expression was expected of
type
string
Or-patterns do sometimes work, but only when you don't make use of the type
information that is discovered during the pattern match. Here's an example of a function
that uses or-patterns successfully.
# let requires_io (type a) (kind : a Source_kind.t) =
match kind with
| Filename | Host_and_port -> true
| Raw_data -> false;;
val requires_io : 'a Source_kind.t -> bool = <fun>
In any case, the lack of or-patterns is annoying, but it's not a big deal, since you
can reduce the code duplication by pulling out most of the content of the duplicated
right-hand sides into functions that can be called in each of the duplicated cases.
10.3.2
Deriving Serializers
As will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 21 (Data Serialization with S-
Expressions), s-expressions are a convenient data format for representing structured
data. Rather than write the serializers and deserializers by hand, we typically use

10.3 Deriving Serializers
189
ppx_sexp_value, which is a syntax extension which auto-generates these functions for
a given type, based on that type's denition.
Here's an example:
# type position = { x: float; y: float } [@@deriving sexp];;
type position = { x : float; y : float; }
val position_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> position = <fun>
val sexp_of_position : position -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# sexp_of_position { x = 3.5; y = -2. };;
- : Sexp.t = ((x 3.5) (y -2))
# position_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "((x 72) (y 1.2))");;
- : position = {x = 72.; y = 1.2}
While [@@deriving sexp] works with most types, it doesn't always work with
GADTs.
# type _ number_kind =
| Int : int number_kind
| Float : float number_kind
[@@deriving sexp];;
Lines 1-4, characters 1-20:
Error: This expression has type int number_kind
but an expression was expected of type a__001_ number_kind
Type int is not compatible with type a__001_
The error message is pretty awful, but if you stop and think about it, it's not too
surprising that we ran into trouble here. What should the type of number_kind_of_sexp
be anyway? When parsing "Int", the returned type would have to be int number_kind,
and when parsing "Float", the type would have to be float number_kind. That kind
of dependency between the value of an argument and the type of the returned value is
just not expressible in OCaml's type system.
This argument doesn't stop us from serializing, and indeed, [@@deriving sexp_of],
which only creates the serializer, works just ne.
# type _ number_kind =
| Int : int number_kind
| Float : float number_kind
[@@deriving sexp_of];;
type _ number_kind = Int : int number_kind | Float : float number_kind
val sexp_of_number_kind :
('a__001_ -> Sexp.t) -> 'a__001_ number_kind -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# sexp_of_number_kind Int.sexp_of_t Int;;
- : Sexp.t = Int
It is possible to build a deserializer for number_kind, but it's tricky. First, we'll need
a type that packs up a number_kind while hiding its type parameter. This is going to
be the value we return from our parser.
type packed_number_kind = P : _ number_kind -> packed_number_kind
Next, we'll need to create a non-GADT version of our type, for which we'll derive a
deserializer.
type simple_number_kind = Int | Float [@@deriving of_sexp]

190
GADTs
Then, we write a function for converting from our non-GADT type to the packed
variety.
# let simple_number_kind_to_packed_number_kind kind :
packed_number_kind
=
match kind with
| Int -> P Int
| Float -> P Float;;
val simple_number_kind_to_packed_number_kind :
simple_number_kind -> packed_number_kind = <fun>
Finally, we combine our generated sexp-converter with our conversion type to
produce the full deserialization function.
# let number_kind_of_sexp sexp =
simple_number_kind_of_sexp sexp
|> simple_number_kind_to_packed_number_kind;;
val number_kind_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> packed_number_kind = <fun>
And here's that function in action.
# List.map ~f:number_kind_of_sexp
[ Sexp.of_string "Float"; Sexp.of_string "Int" ];;
- : packed_number_kind list = [P Float; P Int]
While all of this is doable, it's denitely awkward, and requires some unpleasant
code duplication.

11
Functors
Up until now, we've seen OCaml's modules play an important but limited role. In
particular, we've used modules to organize code into units with specied interfaces.
But OCaml's module system can do much more than that, serving as a powerful tool for
building generic code and structuring large-scale systems. Much of that power comes
from functors.
Functors are, roughly speaking, functions from modules to modules, and they can
be used to solve a variety of code-structuring problems, including:
Dependency injection Makes the implementations of some components of a system
swappable. This is particularly useful when you want to mock up parts of
your system for testing and simulation purposes.
Autoextension of modules Functors give you a way of extending existing modules
with new functionality in a standardized way. For example, you might want to
add a slew of comparison operators derived from a base comparison function.
To do this by hand would require a lot of repetitive code for each type, but
functors let you write this logic just once and apply it to many dierent types.
Instantiating modules with state Modules can contain mutable states, and that
means that you'll occasionally want to have multiple instantiations of a par-
ticular module, each with its own separate and independent mutable state.
Functors let you automate the construction of such modules.
These are really just some of the uses that you can put functors to. We'll make no
attempt to provide examples of all of the uses of functors here. Instead, this chapter
will try to provide examples that illuminate the language features and design patterns
that you need to master in order to use functors eectively.
11.1
A Trivial Example
Let's create a functor that takes a module containing a single integer variable x and
returns a new module with x incremented by one. This is intended to serve as a way
to walk through the basic mechanics of functors, even though it's not something you'd
want to do in practice.
First, let's dene a signature for a module that contains a single value of type int:

192
Functors
# open Base;;
# module type X_int = sig val x : int end;;
module type X_int = sig val x : int end
Now we can dene our functor. We'll use X_int both to constrain the argument to
the functor and to constrain the module returned by the functor:
# module Increment (M : X_int) : X_int = struct
let x = M.x + 1
end;;
module Increment : functor (M : X_int) -> X_int
One thing that immediately jumps out is that functors are more syntactically heavy-
weight than ordinary functions. For one thing, functors require explicit (module) type
annotations, which ordinary functions do not. Technically, only the type on the input
is mandatory, although in practice, you should usually constrain the module returned
by the functor, just as you should use an mli, even though it's not mandatory.
The following shows what happens when we omit the module type for the output of
the functor:
# module Increment (M : X_int) = struct
let x = M.x + 1
end;;
module Increment : functor (M : X_int) -> sig val x : int end
We can see that the inferred module type of the output is now written out explicitly,
rather than being a reference to the named signature X_int.
We can use Increment to dene new modules:
# module Three = struct let x = 3 end;;
module Three : sig val x : int end
# module Four = Increment(Three);;
module Four : sig val x : int end
# Four.x - Three.x;;
- : int = 1
In this case, we applied Increment to a module whose signature is exactly equal to
X_int. But we can apply Increment to any module that satises the interface X_int, in
the same way that the contents of an ml le must satisfy the mli. That means that the
module type can omit some information available in the module, either by dropping
elds or by leaving some elds abstract. Here's an example:
# module Three_and_more = struct
let x = 3
let y = "three"
end;;
module Three_and_more : sig val x : int val y : string end
# module Four = Increment(Three_and_more);;
module Four : sig val x : int end
The rules for determining whether a module matches a given signature are similar
in spirit to the rules in an object-oriented language that determine whether an object
satises a given interface. As in an object-oriented context, the extra information that
doesn't match the signature you're looking for (in this case, the variable y) is simply
ignored.

11.2 A Bigger Example: Computing with Intervals
193
11.2
A Bigger Example: Computing with Intervals
Let's consider a more realistic example of how to use functors: a library for computing
with intervals. Intervals are a common computational object, and they come up in
dierent contexts and for dierent types. You might need to work with intervals of
oating-point values or strings or times, and in each of these cases, you want similar
operations: testing for emptiness, checking for containment, intersecting intervals, and
so on.
We can use functors to build a generic interval library that can be used with any
type that supports a total ordering on the underlying set.
First we'll dene a module type that captures the information we'll need about the
endpoints of the intervals. This interface, which we'll call Comparable, contains just
two things: a comparison function and the type of the values to be compared:
# module type Comparable = sig
type t
val compare : t -> t -> int
end;;
module type Comparable = sig type t val compare : t -> t -> int end
The comparison function follows the standard OCaml idiom for such functions,
returning 0 if the two elements are equal, a positive number if the rst element is larger
than the second, and a negative number if the rst element is smaller than the second.
Thus, we could rewrite the standard comparison functions on top of compare.
compare x y < 0
(* x < y *)
compare x y = 0
(* x = y *)
compare x y > 0
(* x > y *)
(This idiom is a bit of a historical error. It would be better if compare returned a
variant with three cases for less than, greater than, and equal. But it's a well-established
idiom at this point, and unlikely to change.)
The functor for creating the interval module follows. We represent an interval with a
variant type, which is either Empty or Interval (x,y), where x and y are the bounds of
the interval. In addition to the type, the body of the functor contains implementations
of a number of useful primitives for interacting with intervals:
# module Make_interval(Endpoint : Comparable) = struct
type t = | Interval of Endpoint.t * Endpoint.t
| Empty
(** [create low high] creates a new interval from [low] to
[high].
If [low > high], then the interval is empty *)
let create low high =
if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
else Interval (low,high)
(** Returns true iff the interval is empty *)
let is_empty = function
| Empty -> true
| Interval _ -> false

194
Functors
(** [contains t x] returns true iff [x] is contained in the
interval [t] *)
let contains t x =
match t with
| Empty -> false
| Interval (l,h) ->
Endpoint.compare x l >= 0 && Endpoint.compare x h <= 0
(** [intersect t1 t2] returns the intersection of the two input
intervals *)
let intersect t1 t2 =
let min x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x else y in
let max x y = if Endpoint.compare x y >= 0 then x else y in
match t1,t2 with
| Empty, _ | _, Empty -> Empty
| Interval (l1,h1), Interval (l2,h2) ->
create (max l1 l2) (min h1 h2)
end;;
module Make_interval :
functor (Endpoint : Comparable) ->
sig
type t = Interval of Endpoint.t * Endpoint.t | Empty
val create : Endpoint.t -> Endpoint.t -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> Endpoint.t -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
We can instantiate the functor by applying it to a module with the right signature.
In the following code, rather than name the module rst and then call the functor, we
provide the functor input as an anonymous module:
# module Int_interval =
Make_interval(struct
type t = int
let compare = Int.compare
end);;
module Int_interval :
sig
type t = Interval of int * int | Empty
val create : int -> int -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> int -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
If the input interface for your functor is aligned with the standards of the libraries
you use, then you don't need to construct a custom module to feed to the functor. In
this case, we can directly use the Int or String modules provided by Base:
# module Int_interval = Make_interval(Int);;
module Int_interval :
sig
type t = Make_interval(Base.Int).t = Interval of int * int | Empty
val create : int -> int -> t

11.2 A Bigger Example: Computing with Intervals
195
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> int -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
# module String_interval = Make_interval(String);;
module String_interval :
sig
type t =
Make_interval(Base.String).t =
Interval of string * string
| Empty
val create : string -> string -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> string -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
This works because many modules in Base, including Int and String, satisfy an
extended version of the Comparable signature described previously. Such standardized
signatures are good practice, both because they make functors easier to use, and because
they encourage standardization that makes your codebase easier to navigate.
We can use the newly dened Int_interval module like any ordinary module:
# let i1 = Int_interval.create 3 8;;
val i1 : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Interval (3, 8)
# let i2 = Int_interval.create 4 10;;
val i2 : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Interval (4, 10)
# Int_interval.intersect i1 i2;;
- : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Interval (4, 8)
This design gives us the freedom to use any comparison function we want for
comparing the endpoints. We could, for example, create a type of integer interval with
the order of the comparison reversed, as follows:
# module Rev_int_interval =
Make_interval(struct
type t = int
let compare x y = Int.compare y x
end);;
module Rev_int_interval :
sig
type t = Interval of int * int | Empty
val create : int -> int -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> int -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
The behavior of Rev_int_interval is of course dierent from Int_interval:
# let interval = Int_interval.create 4 3;;
val interval : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Empty
# let rev_interval = Rev_int_interval.create 4 3;;
val rev_interval : Rev_int_interval.t = Rev_int_interval.Interval (4,
3)
Importantly, Rev_int_interval.t is a dierent type than Int_interval.t, even

196
Functors
though its physical representation is the same. Indeed, the type system will prevent us
from confusing them.
# Int_interval.contains rev_interval 3;;
Line 1, characters 23-35:
Error: This expression has type Rev_int_interval.t
but an expression was expected of type Int_interval.t
This is important, because confusing the two kinds of intervals would be a semantic
error, and it's an easy one to make. The ability of functors to mint new types is a useful
trick that comes up a lot.
11.2.1
Making the Functor Abstract
There's a problem with Make_interval. The code we wrote depends on the invariant
that the upper bound of an interval is greater than its lower bound, but that invari-
ant can be violated. The invariant is enforced by the create function, but because
Int_interval.t is not abstract, we can bypass the create function:
# Int_interval.is_empty (* going through create *)
(Int_interval.create 4 3);;
- : bool = true
# Int_interval.is_empty (* bypassing create *)
(Int_interval.Interval (4,3));;
- : bool = false
To make Int_interval.t abstract, we need to restrict the output of Make_interval
with an interface. Here's an explicit interface that we can use for that purpose:
# module type Interval_intf = sig
type t
type endpoint
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end;;
module type Interval_intf =
sig
type t
type endpoint
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
This interface includes the type endpoint to give us a way of referring to the endpoint
type. Given this interface, we can redo our denition of Make_interval. Notice that we
added the type endpoint to the implementation of the module to match Interval_intf:
# module Make_interval(Endpoint : Comparable) : Interval_intf = struct
type endpoint = Endpoint.t
type t = | Interval of Endpoint.t * Endpoint.t
| Empty

11.2 Sharing Constraints
197
(** [create low high] creates a new interval from [low] to
[high].
If [low > high], then the interval is empty *)
let create low high =
if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
else Interval (low,high)
(** Returns true iff the interval is empty *)
let is_empty = function
| Empty -> true
| Interval _ -> false
(** [contains t x] returns true iff [x] is contained in the
interval [t] *)
let contains t x =
match t with
| Empty -> false
| Interval (l,h) ->
Endpoint.compare x l >= 0 && Endpoint.compare x h <= 0
(** [intersect t1 t2] returns the intersection of the two input
intervals *)
let intersect t1 t2 =
let min x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x else y in
let max x y = if Endpoint.compare x y >= 0 then x else y in
match t1,t2 with
| Empty, _ | _, Empty -> Empty
| Interval (l1,h1), Interval (l2,h2) ->
create (max l1 l2) (min h1 h2)
end;;
module Make_interval : functor (Endpoint : Comparable) ->
Interval_intf
11.2.2
Sharing Constraints
The resulting module is abstract, but it's unfortunately too abstract. In particular, we
haven't exposed the type endpoint, which means that we can't even construct an
interval anymore:
# module Int_interval = Make_interval(Int);;
module Int_interval :
sig
type t = Make_interval(Base.Int).t
type endpoint = Make_interval(Base.Int).endpoint
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
# Int_interval.create 3 4;;
Line 1, characters 21-22:
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of
type
Int_interval.endpoint

198
Functors
To x this, we need to expose the fact that endpoint is equal to Int.t (or more
generally, Endpoint.t, where Endpoint is the argument to the functor). One way of
doing this is through a sharing constraint, which allows you to tell the compiler to
expose the fact that a given type is equal to some other type. The syntax for a simple
sharing constraint is as follows:
<Module_type> with type <type> = <type'>
The result of this expression is a new signature that's been modied so that it exposes
the fact that type dened inside of the module type is equal to type' whose denition
is outside of it. One can also apply multiple sharing constraints to the same signature:
<Module_type> with type <type1> = <type1'> and type <type2> = <type2'>
We can use a sharing constraint to create a specialized version of Interval_intf
for integer intervals:
# module type Int_interval_intf =
Interval_intf with type endpoint = int;;
module type Int_interval_intf =
sig
type t
type endpoint = int
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
We can also use sharing constraints in the context of a functor. The most common
use case is where you want to expose that some of the types of the module being
generated by the functor are related to the types in the module fed to the functor.
In this case, we'd like to expose an equality between the type endpoint in the
new module and the type Endpoint.t, from the module Endpoint that is the functor
argument. We can do this as follows:
# module Make_interval(Endpoint : Comparable)
: (Interval_intf with type endpoint = Endpoint.t)
= struct
type endpoint = Endpoint.t
type t = | Interval of Endpoint.t * Endpoint.t
| Empty
(** [create low high] creates a new interval from [low] to
[high].
If [low > high], then the interval is empty *)
let create low high =
if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
else Interval (low,high)
(** Returns true iff the interval is empty *)
let is_empty = function
| Empty -> true
| Interval _ -> false

11.2 Destructive Substitution
199
(** [contains t x] returns true iff [x] is contained in the
interval [t] *)
let contains t x =
match t with
| Empty -> false
| Interval (l,h) ->
Endpoint.compare x l >= 0 && Endpoint.compare x h <= 0
(** [intersect t1 t2] returns the intersection of the two input
intervals *)
let intersect t1 t2 =
let min x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x else y in
let max x y = if Endpoint.compare x y >= 0 then x else y in
match t1,t2 with
| Empty, _ | _, Empty -> Empty
| Interval (l1,h1), Interval (l2,h2) ->
create (max l1 l2) (min h1 h2)
end;;
module Make_interval :
functor (Endpoint : Comparable) ->
sig
type t
type endpoint = Endpoint.t
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
Now the interface is as it was, except that endpoint is known to be equal to
Endpoint.t. As a result of that type equality, we can again do things that require that
endpoint be exposed, like constructing intervals:
# module Int_interval = Make_interval(Int);;
module Int_interval :
sig
type t = Make_interval(Base.Int).t
type endpoint = int
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
# let i = Int_interval.create 3 4;;
val i : Int_interval.t = <abstr>
# Int_interval.contains i 5;;
- : bool = false
11.2.3
Destructive Substitution
Sharing constraints basically do the job, but they have some downsides. In particular,
we've now been stuck with the useless type declaration of endpoint that clutters up
both the interface and the implementation. A better solution would be to modify the

200
Functors
Interval_intf signature by replacing endpoint with Endpoint.t everywhere it shows
up, and deleting the denition of endpoint from the signature. We can do just this
using what's called destructive substitution. Here's the basic syntax:
<Module_type> with type <type> := <type'>
This looks just like a sharing constraint, except that we use := instead of =. The
following shows how we could use this with Make_interval.
# module type Int_interval_intf =
Interval_intf with type endpoint := int;;
module type Int_interval_intf =
sig
type t
val create : int -> int -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> int -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
There's now no endpoint type: all of its occurrences have been replaced by int. As
with sharing constraints, we can also use this in the context of a functor:
# module Make_interval(Endpoint : Comparable)
: Interval_intf with type endpoint := Endpoint.t =
struct
type t = | Interval of Endpoint.t * Endpoint.t
| Empty
(** [create low high] creates a new interval from [low] to
[high].
If [low > high], then the interval is empty *)
let create low high =
if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
else Interval (low,high)
(** Returns true iff the interval is empty *)
let is_empty = function
| Empty -> true
| Interval _ -> false
(** [contains t x] returns true iff [x] is contained in the
interval [t] *)
let contains t x =
match t with
| Empty -> false
| Interval (l,h) ->
Endpoint.compare x l >= 0 && Endpoint.compare x h <= 0
(** [intersect t1 t2] returns the intersection of the two input
intervals *)
let intersect t1 t2 =
let min x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x else y in
let max x y = if Endpoint.compare x y >= 0 then x else y in
match t1,t2 with
| Empty, _ | _, Empty -> Empty
| Interval (l1,h1), Interval (l2,h2) ->

11.2 Using Multiple Interfaces
201
create (max l1 l2) (min h1 h2)
end;;
module Make_interval :
functor (Endpoint : Comparable) ->
sig
type t
val create : Endpoint.t -> Endpoint.t -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> Endpoint.t -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
The interface is precisely what we want: the type t is abstract, and the type of the
endpoint is exposed; so we can create values of type Int_interval.t using the creation
function, but not directly using the constructors and thereby violating the invariants of
the module.
# module Int_interval = Make_interval(Int);;
module Int_interval :
sig
type t = Make_interval(Base.Int).t
val create : int -> int -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> int -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
end
# Int_interval.is_empty
(Int_interval.create 3 4);;
- : bool = false
# Int_interval.is_empty (Int_interval.Interval (4,3));;
Line 1, characters 24-45:
Error: Unbound constructor Int_interval.Interval
In addition, the endpoint type is gone from the interface, meaning we no longer need
to dene the endpoint type alias in the body of the module.
It's worth noting that the name is somewhat misleading, in that there's nothing
destructive about destructive substitution; it's really just a way of creating a new
signature by transforming an existing one.
11.2.4
Using Multiple Interfaces
Another feature that we might want for our interval module is the ability to serialize,
i.e., to be able to read and write intervals as a stream of bytes. In this case, we'll do this
by converting to and from s-expressions, which were mentioned already in Chapter 8
(Error Handling). To recall, an s-expression is essentially a parenthesized expression
whose atoms are strings, and it is a serialization format that is used commonly in Base.
Here's an example:
# Sexp.List [ Sexp.Atom "This"; Sexp.Atom "is"
; Sexp.List [Sexp.Atom "an"; Sexp.Atom "s-expression"]];;
- : Sexp.t = (This is (an s-expression))

202
Functors
Base is designed to work well with a syntax extension called ppx_sexp_conv
which will generate s-expression conversion functions for any type annotated with
[@@deriving sexp]. We can enable ppx_sexp_conv along with a collection of other
useful extensions by enabling ppx_jane:
# #require "ppx_jane";;
Now, we can use the deriving annotation to create sexp-converters for a given type.
# type some_type = int * string list [@@deriving sexp];;
type some_type = int * string list
val some_type_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> some_type = <fun>
val sexp_of_some_type : some_type -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# sexp_of_some_type (33, ["one"; "two"]);;
- : Sexp.t = (33 (one two))
# Core.Sexp.of_string "(44 (five six))" |> some_type_of_sexp;;
- : some_type = (44, ["five"; "six"])
We'll discuss s-expressions and Sexplib in more detail in Chapter 21 (Data Seri-
alization with S-Expressions), but for now, let's see what happens if we attach the
[@@deriving sexp] declaration to the denition of t within the functor:
# module Make_interval(Endpoint : Comparable)
: (Interval_intf with type endpoint := Endpoint.t) = struct
type t = | Interval of Endpoint.t * Endpoint.t
| Empty
[@@deriving sexp]
(** [create low high] creates a new interval from [low] to
[high].
If [low > high], then the interval is empty *)
let create low high =
if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
else Interval (low,high)
(** Returns true iff the interval is empty *)
let is_empty = function
| Empty -> true
| Interval _ -> false
(** [contains t x] returns true iff [x] is contained in the
interval [t] *)
let contains t x =
match t with
| Empty -> false
| Interval (l,h) ->
Endpoint.compare x l >= 0 && Endpoint.compare x h <= 0
(** [intersect t1 t2] returns the intersection of the two input
intervals *)
let intersect t1 t2 =
let min x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x else y in
let max x y = if Endpoint.compare x y >= 0 then x else y in
match t1,t2 with
| Empty, _ | _, Empty -> Empty
| Interval (l1,h1), Interval (l2,h2) ->
create (max l1 l2) (min h1 h2)

11.2 Using Multiple Interfaces
203
end;;
Line 4, characters 28-38:
Error: Unbound value Endpoint.t_of_sexp
The problem is that [@@deriving sexp] adds code for dening the s-expression
converters, and that code assumes that Endpoint has the appropriate sexp-conversion
functions for Endpoint.t. But all we know about Endpoint is that it satises the
Comparable interface, which doesn't say anything about s-expressions.
Happily, Base comes with a built-in interface for just this purpose called Sexpable.S,
which is dened as follows:
sig
type t
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
val t_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> t
end
We can modify Make_interval to use the Sexpable.S interface, for both its input
and its output. First, let's create an extended version of the Interval_intf interface that
includes the functions from the Sexpable.S interface. We can do this using destructive
substitution on the Sexpable.S interface, to avoid having multiple distinct type t's
clashing with each other:
# module type Interval_intf_with_sexp = sig
include Interval_intf
include Sexpable.S with type t := t
end;;
module type Interval_intf_with_sexp =
sig
type t
type endpoint
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
val t_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> t
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
end
Equivalently, we can dene a type t within our new module, and apply destructive
substitutions to all of the included interfaces, Interval_intf included, as shown in
the following example. This is somewhat cleaner when combining multiple interfaces,
since it correctly reects that all of the signatures are being handled equivalently:
# module type Interval_intf_with_sexp = sig
type t
include Interval_intf with type t := t
include Sexpable.S with type t := t
end;;
module type Interval_intf_with_sexp =
sig
type t
type endpoint
val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> t

val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> endpoint -> bool
val intersect : t -> t -> t
val t_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> t
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
end
Now we can write the functor itself. We have been careful to override the sexp
converter here to ensure that the data structure's invariants are still maintained when
reading in from an s-expression:
# module Make_interval(Endpoint : sig
type t
include Comparable with type t := t
include Sexpable.S with type t := t
end)

let max x y = if Endpoint.compare x y >= 0 then x else y in

11.3
Extending Modules
Another common use of functors is to generate type-specic functionality for a given
module in a standardized way. Let's see how this works in the context of a functional
queue, which is just a functional version of a FIFO (rst-in, rst-out) queue. Being
functional, operations on the queue return new queues, rather than modifying the
queues that were passed in.
Here's a reasonable mli for such a module:
type 'a t
val empty : 'a t
(** [enqueue q el] adds [el] to the back of [q] *)

206
Functors
val enqueue : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a t
(** [dequeue q] returns None if the [q] is empty, otherwise returns
the first element of the queue and the remainder of the queue *)
val dequeue : 'a t -> ('a * 'a t) option
(** Folds over the queue, from front to back *)
val fold : 'a t -> init:'acc -> f:('acc -> 'a -> 'acc) -> 'acc
The signature of the fold function requires some explanation. It follows the same
pattern as the List.fold function we described in Chapter 4.4 (Using the List Module
Eectively). Essentially, Fqueue.fold q ~init ~f walks over the elements of q from
front to back, starting with an accumulator of init and using f to update the accumu-
lator value as it walks over the queue, returning the nal value of the accumulator at
the end of the computation. fold is a quite powerful operation, as we'll see.
We'll implement Fqueue using the well known trick of maintaining an input and an
output list so that one can both eciently enqueue on the input list and dequeue from
the output list. If you attempt to dequeue when the output list is empty, the input list is
reversed and becomes the new output list. Here's the implementation:
open Base
type 'a t = 'a list * 'a list
let empty = ([],[])
let enqueue (in_list, out_list) x =
(x :: in_list,out_list)
let dequeue (in_list, out_list) =
match out_list with
| hd :: tl -> Some (hd, (in_list, tl))
| [] ->
match List.rev in_list with
| [] -> None
| hd :: tl -> Some (hd, ([], tl))
let fold (in_list, out_list) ~init ~f =
let after_out = List.fold ~init ~f out_list in
List.fold_right ~init:after_out ~f:(fun x acc -> f acc x) in_list
One problem with Fqueue is that the interface is quite skeletal. There are lots of
useful helper functions that one might want that aren't there. The List module, by way
of contrast, has functions like List.iter, which runs a function on each element; and
List.for_all, which returns true if and only if the given predicate evaluates to true
on every element of the list. Such helper functions come up for pretty much every
container type, and implementing them over and over is a dull and repetitive aair.
As it happens, many of these helper functions can be derived mechanically from
the fold function we already implemented. Rather than write all of these helper
functions by hand for every new container type, we can instead use a functor to add
this functionality to any container that has a fold function.
We'll create a new module, Foldable, that automates the process of adding helper

11.3 Extending Modules
207
functions to a fold-supporting container. As you can see, Foldable contains a module
signature S which denes the signature that is required to support folding; and a functor
Extend that allows one to extend any module that matches Foldable.S:
open Base
module type S = sig
type 'a t
val fold : 'a t -> init:'acc -> f:('acc -> 'a -> 'acc) -> 'acc
end
module type Extension = sig
type 'a t
val iter
: 'a t -> f:('a -> unit) -> unit
val length
: 'a t -> int
val count
: 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> int
val for_all : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool
val exists
: 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool
end
(* For extending a Foldable module *)
module Extend(Arg : S)
: (Extension with type 'a t := 'a Arg.t) =
struct
open Arg
let iter t ~f =
fold t ~init:() ~f:(fun () a -> f a)
let length t =
fold t ~init:0
~f:(fun acc _ -> acc + 1)
let count t ~f =
fold t ~init:0
~f:(fun count x -> count + if f x then 1 else 0)
exception Short_circuit
let for_all c ~f =
try iter c ~f:(fun x -> if not (f x) then raise Short_circuit);
true
with Short_circuit -> false
let exists c ~f =
try iter c ~f:(fun x -> if f x then raise Short_circuit); false
with Short_circuit -> true
end
Now we can apply this to Fqueue. We can create an interface for an extended version
of Fqueue as follows:
type 'a t
include (module type of Fqueue) with type 'a t := 'a t
include Foldable.Extension with type 'a t := 'a t
In order to apply the functor, we'll put the denition of Fqueue in a submodule
called T, and then call Foldable.Extend on T:

208
Functors
include Fqueue
include Foldable.Extend(Fqueue)
Base comes with a number of functors for extending modules that follow this same
basic pattern, including:
• Container.Make : Very similar to Foldable.Extend.
• Comparable.Make : Adds support for functionality that depends on the presence of a
comparison function, including support for containers like maps and sets.
• Hashable.Make : Adds support for hashing-based data structures including hash
tables, hash sets, and hash heaps.
• Monad.Make : For so-called monadic libraries, like those discussed in Chapters Chap-
ter 8 (Error Handling) and Chapter 17 (Concurrent Programming with Async).
Here, the functor is used to provide a collection of standard helper functions based
on the bind and return operators.
These functors come in handy when you want to add the same kind of functionality
that is commonly available in Base to your own types.
We've really only covered some of the possible uses of functors. Functors are
really a quite powerful tool for modularizing your code. The cost is that functors are
syntactically heavyweight compared to the rest of the language, and that there are some
tricky issues you need to understand to use them eectively, with sharing constraints
and destructive substitution being high on that list.
All of this means that for small and simple programs, heavy use of functors is
probably a mistake. But as your programs get more complicated and you need more
eective modular architectures, functors become a highly valuable tool.

First-Class Modules
You can think of OCaml as being broken up into two parts: a core language that
is concerned with values and types, and a module language that is concerned with
modules and module signatures. These sublanguages are stratied, in that modules can
contain types and values, but ordinary values can't contain modules or module types.
That means you can't do things like dene a variable whose value is a module, or a
function that takes a module as an argument.
OCaml provides a way around this stratication in the form of rst-class modules.
First-class modules are ordinary values that can be created from and converted back
to regular modules.
First-class modules are a sophisticated technique, and you'll need to get comfortable
with some advanced aspects of the language to use them eectively. But it's worth
learning, because letting modules into the core language is quite powerful, increasing
the range of what you can express and making it easier to build exible and modular
systems.
12.1
Working with First-Class Modules
We'll start out by covering the basic mechanics of rst-class modules by working
through some toy examples. We'll get to more realistic examples in the next section.
12.1.1
Creating First-Class Modules
In that light, consider the following signature of a module with a single integer variable:
# open Base;;
# module type X_int = sig val x : int end;;
module type X_int = sig val x : int end
We can also create a module that matches this signature:
# module Three : X_int = struct let x = 3 end;;
module Three : X_int
# Three.x;;
- : int = 3
A rst-class module is created by packaging up a module with a signature that it
satises. This is done using the module keyword.

210
First-Class Modules
(module <Module> : <Module_type>)
We can convert Three into a rst-class module as follows:
# let three = (module Three : X_int);;
val three : (module X_int) = <module>
12.1.2
Inference and Anonymous Modules
The module type doesn't need to be part of the construction of a rst-class module if
it can be inferred. Thus, we can write:
# module Four = struct let x = 4 end;;
module Four : sig val x : int end
# let numbers = [ three; (module Four) ];;
val numbers : (module X_int) list = [<module>; <module>]
We can also create a rst-class module from an anonymous module:
# let numbers = [three; (module struct let x = 4 end)];;
val numbers : (module X_int) list = [<module>; <module>]
12.1.3
Unpacking First-Class Modules
In order to access the contents of a rst-class module, you need to unpack it into an
ordinary module. This can be done using the val keyword, using this syntax:
(val <first_class_module> : <Module_type>)
Here's an example:
# module New_three = (val three : X_int);;
module New_three : X_int
# New_three.x;;
- : int = 3
12.1.4
Functions for Manipulating First-Class Modules
We can also write ordinary functions which consume and create rst-class modules.
The following shows the denition of two functions: to_int, which converts a (module
X_int) into an int; and plus, which returns the sum of two (module X_int):
# let to_int m =
let module M = (val m : X_int) in
M.x;;
val to_int : (module X_int) -> int = <fun>
# let plus m1 m2 =
(module struct
let x = to_int m1 + to_int m2
end : X_int);;
val plus : (module X_int) -> (module X_int) -> (module X_int) = <fun>

12.1 Exposing types
211
You can also unpack a rst-class module with a pattern match, which lets us write
to_int more concisely:
# let to_int (module M : X_int) = M.x;;
val to_int : (module X_int) -> int = <fun>
With these functions in hand, we can now work with values of type (module X_int)
in a more natural style, taking advantage of the concision and simplicity of the core
language:
# let six = plus three three;;
val six : (module X_int) = <module>
# to_int (List.fold ~init:six ~f:plus [three;three]);;
- : int = 12
12.1.5
Richer First-Class Modules
First-class modules can contain types and functions in addition to simple values like
int. Here's an interface that contains a type and a corresponding bump operation that
takes a value of the type and produces a new one:
# module type Bumpable = sig
type t
val bump : t -> t
end;;
module type Bumpable = sig type t val bump : t -> t end
We can create multiple instances of this module with dierent underlying types:
# module Int_bumper = struct
type t = int
let bump n = n + 1
end;;
module Int_bumper : sig type t = int val bump : t -> t end
# module Float_bumper = struct
type t = float
let bump n = n +. 1.
end;;
module Float_bumper : sig type t = float val bump : t -> t end
And we can convert these to rst-class modules:
# let int_bumper = (module Int_bumper : Bumpable);;
val int_bumper : (module Bumpable) = <module>
12.1.6
Exposing types
You can't do much with int_bumper because it's fully abstract, so we can't take
advantage of the fact that the type in question is int, which makes it impossible to
construct or really do anything with values of type Bumper.t.
# let (module Bumper) = int_bumper in
Bumper.bump 3;;
Line 2, characters 15-16:

212
First-Class Modules
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of
type
Bumper.t
To make int_bumper usable, we need to expose that the type Bumpable.t is actually
equal to int. Below we'll do that for int_bumper, and also provide the corresponding
denition for float_bumper.
# let int_bumper = (module Int_bumper : Bumpable with type t = int);;
val int_bumper : (module Bumpable with type t = int) = <module>
# let float_bumper = (module Float_bumper : Bumpable with type t =
float);;
val float_bumper : (module Bumpable with type t = float) = <module>
The addition of the sharing constraint has exposed the type t, which lets us actually
use the values within the module.
# let (module Bumper) = int_bumper in
Bumper.bump 3;;
- : int = 4
# let (module Bumper) = float_bumper in
Bumper.bump 3.5;;
- : float = 4.5
We can also use these rst-class modules polymorphically. The following function
takes two arguments: a Bumpable module and a list of elements of the same type as the
type t of the module:
# let bump_list
(type a)
(module Bumper : Bumpable with type t = a)
(l: a list)
=
List.map ~f:Bumper.bump l;;
val bump_list : (module Bumpable with type t = 'a) -> 'a list -> 'a
list =
<fun>
In this example, a is a locally abstract type. For any function, you can declare a
pseudoparameter of the form (type a) which introduces a fresh type named a. This
type acts like an abstract type within the context of the function. In the example above,
the locally abstract type was used as part of a sharing constraint that ties the type B.t
with the type of the elements of the list passed in.
The resulting function is polymorphic in both the type of the list element and the
type Bumpable.t. We can see this function in action:
# bump_list int_bumper [1;2;3];;
- : int list = [2; 3; 4]
# bump_list float_bumper [1.5;2.5;3.5];;
- : float list = [2.5; 3.5; 4.5]
Polymorphic rst-class modules are important because they allow you to connect the
types associated with a rst-class module to the types of other values you're working
with.

12.2 Example: A Query-Handling Framework
213
More on Locally Abstract Types
One of the key properties of locally abstract types is that they're dealt with as abstract
types in the function they're dened within, but are polymorphic from the outside.
Consider the following example:
# let wrap_in_list (type a) (x:a) = [x];;
val wrap_in_list : 'a -> 'a list = <fun>
The type a is used in a way that is compatible with it being abstract, but the type of
the function that is inferred is polymorphic.
If, on the other hand, we try to use the type a as if it were equivalent to some concrete
type, say, int, then the compiler will complain.
# let double_int (type a) (x:a) = x + x;;
Line 1, characters 33-34:
Error: This expression has type a but an expression was expected of
type int
One common use of locally abstract types is to create a new type that can be used
in constructing a module. Here's an example of doing this to create a new rst-class
module:
# module type Comparable = sig
type t
val compare : t -> t -> int
end;;
module type Comparable = sig type t val compare : t -> t -> int end
# let create_comparable (type a) compare =
(module struct
type t = a
let compare = compare
end : Comparable with type t = a);;
val create_comparable :
('a -> 'a -> int) -> (module Comparable with type t = 'a) = <fun>
# create_comparable Int.compare;;
- : (module Comparable with type t = int) = <module>
# create_comparable Float.compare;;
- : (module Comparable with type t = float) = <module>
This technique is useful beyond rst-class modules. For example, we can use the
same approach to construct a local module to be fed to a functor.
12.2
Example: A Query-Handling Framework
Now let's look at rst-class modules in the context of a more complete and realistic
example. In particular, we're going to implement a system for responding to user-
generated queries.
This system will use s-expressions for formatting queries and responses, as well
as the conguration for the query handler. S-expressions are a simple, exible, and
human-readable serialization format commonly used in Base and related libraries. For

214
First-Class Modules
now, it's enough to think of them as balanced parenthetical expressions whose atomic
values are strings, e.g., (this (is an) (s expression)). S-expressions are covered
in more detail in Chapter 21 (Data Serialization with S-Expressions).
The following signature for a module that implements a system for responding to
user-generated queries. Here, we use Base's Sexp module for handling s-expressions.
Note that we could just as easily have used another serialization format, like JSON, as
discussed in Chapter 19 (Handling JSON Data).
module type Query_handler = sig
(** Configuration for a query handler *)
type config
val sexp_of_config : config -> Sexp.t
val config_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> config
(** The name of the query-handling service *)
val name : string
(** The state of the query handler *)
type t
(** Creates a new query handler from a config *)
val create : config -> t
(** Evaluate a given query, where both input and output are
s-expressions *)
val eval : t -> Sexp.t -> Sexp.t Or_error.t
end;;
Implementing s-expression converters by hand is tedious and error-prone, but hap-
pily, we have an alternative. ppx_sexp_conv is a syntax extension which can be used
to automatically generate s-expression converters based on their type denition. We'll
enable ppx_sexp_conv by enabling ppx_jane, which brings in a larger family of syntax
extensions.
# #require "ppx_jane";;
Here's an example of the extension in action. Note that we need the annotation
[@@deriving sexp] to kick o the generation of the converters.
# type u = { a: int; b: float } [@@deriving sexp];;
type u = { a : int; b : float; }
val u_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> u = <fun>
val sexp_of_u : u -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# sexp_of_u {a=3;b=7.};;
- : Sexp.t = ((a 3) (b 7))
# u_of_sexp (Core.Sexp.of_string "((a 43) (b 3.4))");;
- : u = {a = 43; b = 3.4}
The same annotations can be attached within a signature to add the appropriate type
signature.
# module type M = sig type t [@@deriving sexp] end;;
module type M =

12.2 Implementing a Query Handler
215
sig type t val t_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> t val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
end
12.2.1
Implementing a Query Handler
Now we can construct an example of a query handler that satises the Query_handler
interface. We'll start with a handler that produces unique integer IDs, which works by
keeping an internal counter that's bumped every time a new value is requested. The
input to the query in this case is just the trivial s-expression (), otherwise known as
Sexp.unit:
module Unique = struct
type config = int [@@deriving sexp]
type t = { mutable next_id: int }
let name = "unique"
let create start_at = { next_id = start_at }
let eval t sexp =
match Or_error.try_with (fun () -> unit_of_sexp sexp) with
| Error _ as err -> err
| Ok () ->
let response = Ok (Int.sexp_of_t t.next_id) in
t.next_id <- t.next_id + 1;
response
end;;
We can use this module to create an instance of the Unique query handler and interact
with it directly:
# let unique = Unique.create 0;;
val unique : Unique.t = {Unique.next_id = 0}
# Unique.eval unique (Sexp.List []);;
- : (Sexp.t, Error.t) result = Ok 0
# Unique.eval unique (Sexp.List []);;
- : (Sexp.t, Error.t) result = Ok 1
Here's another example: a query handler that does directory listings. Here, the cong
is the default directory that relative paths are interpreted within:
module List_dir = struct
type config = string [@@deriving sexp]
type t = { cwd: string }
(** [is_abs p] Returns true if [p] is an absolute path
*)
let is_abs p =
String.length p > 0 && Char.(=) p.[0] '/'
let name = "ls"
let create cwd = { cwd }
let eval t sexp =
match Or_error.try_with (fun () -> string_of_sexp sexp) with
| Error _ as err -> err
| Ok dir ->

216
First-Class Modules
let dir =
if is_abs dir then dir
else Core.Filename.concat t.cwd dir
in
Ok (Array.sexp_of_t String.sexp_of_t (Core.Sys.readdir dir))
end;;
Again, we can create an instance of this query handler and interact with it directly:
# let list_dir = List_dir.create "/var";;
val list_dir : List_dir.t = {List_dir.cwd = "/var"}
# List_dir.eval list_dir (sexp_of_string ".");;
- : (Sexp.t, Error.t) result =
Ok
(yp networkd install empty ma mail spool jabberd vm msgs audit root
lib db
at log folders netboot run rpc tmp backups agentx rwho)
# List_dir.eval list_dir (sexp_of_string "yp");;
- : (Sexp.t, Error.t) result = Ok (binding)
12.2.2
Dispatching to Multiple Query Handlers
Now, what if we want to dispatch queries to any of an arbitrary collection of handlers?
Ideally, we'd just like to pass in the handlers as a simple data structure like a list.
This is awkward to do with modules and functors alone, but it's quite natural with
rst-class modules. The rst thing we'll need to do is create a signature that combines
a Query_handler module with an instantiated query handler:
# module type Query_handler_instance = sig
module Query_handler : Query_handler
val this : Query_handler.t
end;;
module type Query_handler_instance =
sig module Query_handler : Query_handler val this : Query_handler.t
end
With this signature, we can create a rst-class module that encompasses both an
instance of the query and the matching operations for working with that query.
We can create an instance as follows:
# let unique_instance =
(module struct
module Query_handler = Unique
let this = Unique.create 0
end : Query_handler_instance);;
val unique_instance : (module Query_handler_instance) = <module>
Constructing instances in this way is a little verbose, but we can write a function
that eliminates most of this boilerplate. Note that we are again making use of a locally
abstract type:
# let build_instance
(type a)
(module Q : Query_handler with type config = a)

12.2 Dispatching to Multiple Query Handlers
217
config
=
(module struct
module Query_handler = Q
let this = Q.create config
end : Query_handler_instance);;
val build_instance :
(module Query_handler with type config = 'a) ->
'a -> (module Query_handler_instance) = <fun>
Using build_instance, constructing a new instance becomes a one-liner:
# let unique_instance = build_instance (module Unique) 0;;
val unique_instance : (module Query_handler_instance) = <module>
# let list_dir_instance = build_instance (module List_dir)
"/var";;
val list_dir_instance : (module Query_handler_instance) = <module>
We can now write code that lets you dispatch queries to one of a list of query handler
instances. We assume that the shape of the query is as follows:
(query-name query)
where query-name is the name used to determine which query handler to dispatch the
query to, and query is the body of the query.
The rst thing we'll need is a function that takes a list of query handler instances
and constructs a dispatch table from it:
# let build_dispatch_table handlers =
let table = Hashtbl.create (module String) in
List.iter handlers
~f:(fun ((module I : Query_handler_instance) as instance) ->
Hashtbl.set table ~key:I.Query_handler.name ~data:instance);
table;;
val build_dispatch_table :
(module Query_handler_instance) list ->
(string, (module Query_handler_instance)) Hashtbl.Poly.t = <fun>
Next, we'll need a function that dispatches to a handler using a dispatch table:
# let dispatch dispatch_table name_and_query =
match name_and_query with
| Sexp.List [Sexp.Atom name; query] ->
begin match Hashtbl.find dispatch_table name with
| None ->
Or_error.error "Could not find matching handler"
name String.sexp_of_t
| Some (module I : Query_handler_instance) ->
I.Query_handler.eval I.this query
end
| _ ->
Or_error.error_string "malformed query";;
val dispatch :
(string, (module Query_handler_instance)) Hashtbl.Poly.t ->
Sexp.t -> Sexp.t Or_error.t = <fun>
This function interacts with an instance by unpacking it into a module I and then
using the query handler instance (I.this) in concert with the associated module
(I.Query_handler).

218
First-Class Modules
The bundling together of the module and the value is in many ways reminiscent
of object-oriented languages. One key dierence is that rst-class modules allow you
to package up more than just functions or methods. As we've seen, you can also
include types and even modules. We've only used it in a small way here, but this
extra power allows you to build more sophisticated components that involve multiple
interdependent types and values.
We can turn this into a complete, running example by adding a command-line
interface:
# open Stdio;;
# let rec cli dispatch_table =
printf ">>> %!";
let result =
match In_channel.(input_line stdin) with
| None -> `Stop
| Some line ->
match Or_error.try_with (fun () ->
Core.Sexp.of_string line)
with
| Error e -> `Continue (Error.to_string_hum e)
| Ok (Sexp.Atom "quit") -> `Stop
| Ok query ->
begin match dispatch dispatch_table query with
| Error e -> `Continue (Error.to_string_hum e)
| Ok s
-> `Continue (Sexp.to_string_hum s)
end;
in
match result with
| `Stop -> ()
| `Continue msg ->
printf "%s\n%!" msg;
cli dispatch_table;;
val cli : (string, (module Query_handler_instance)) Hashtbl.Poly.t ->
unit =
<fun>
We'll run this command-line interface from a standalone program by putting the
above code in a le, and adding the following to launch the interface.
let () =
cli (build_dispatch_table [unique_instance; list_dir_instance])
Here's an example of a session with this program:
$ dune exec -- ./query_handler.exe
>>> (unique ())
0
>>> (unique ())
1
>>> (ls .)
(agentx at audit backups db empty folders jabberd lib log mail msgs
named
netboot pgsql_socket_alt root rpc run rwho spool tmp vm yp)
>>> (ls vm)

12.2 Loading and Unloading Query Handlers

swapfile6)
12.2.3
Loading and Unloading Query Handlers
One of the advantages of rst-class modules is that they aord a great deal of dynamism
and exibility. For example, it's a fairly simple matter to change our design to allow
query handlers to be loaded and unloaded at runtime.
We'll do this by creating a query handler whose job is to control the set of active
query handlers. The module in question will be called Loader, and its conguration is
a list of known Query_handler modules. Here are the basic types:
module Loader = struct
type config = (module Query_handler) list [@sexp.opaque]
[@@deriving sexp]
type t = { known
: (module Query_handler)
String.Table.t
; active : (module Query_handler_instance) String.Table.t
}
let name = "loader"
Note that a Loader.t has two tables: one containing the known query handler
modules, and one containing the active query handler instances. The Loader.t will
be responsible for creating new instances and adding them to the table, as well as for
removing instances, all in response to user queries.
Next, we'll need a function for creating a Loader.t. This function requires the list
of known query handler modules. Note that the table of active modules starts out as
empty:
let create known_list =
let active = String.Table.create () in
let known
= String.Table.create () in
List.iter known_list
~f:(fun ((module Q : Query_handler) as q) ->
Hashtbl.set known ~key:Q.name ~data:q);
{ known; active }
Now we can write the functions for manipulating the table of active query handlers.
We'll start with the function for loading an instance. Note that it takes as an argument
both the name of the query handler and the conguration for instantiating that handler
in the form of an s-expression. These are used for creating a rst-class module of type
(module Query_handler_instance), which is then added to the active table:
let load t handler_name config =
if Hashtbl.mem t.active handler_name then
Or_error.error "Can't re-register an active handler"
handler_name String.sexp_of_t
else
match Hashtbl.find t.known handler_name with
| None ->
Or_error.error "Unknown handler" handler_name String.sexp_of_t
| Some (module Q : Query_handler) ->

220
First-Class Modules
let instance =
(module struct
module Query_handler = Q
let this = Q.create (Q.config_of_sexp config)
end : Query_handler_instance)
in
Hashtbl.set t.active ~key:handler_name ~data:instance;
Ok Sexp.unit
Since the load function will refuse to load an already active handler, we also need
the ability to unload a handler. Note that the handler explicitly refuses to unload itself:
let unload t handler_name =
if not (Hashtbl.mem t.active handler_name) then
Or_error.error "Handler not active" handler_name
String.sexp_of_t
else if String.(=) handler_name name then
Or_error.error_string "It's unwise to unload yourself"
else (
Hashtbl.remove t.active handler_name;
Ok Sexp.unit
)
Finally, we need to implement the eval function, which will determine the query
interface presented to the user. We'll do this by creating a variant type, and using the
s-expression converter generated for that type to parse the query from the user:
type request =
| Load of string * Sexp.t
| Unload of string
| Known_services
| Active_services
[@@deriving sexp]
The eval function itself is fairly straightforward, dispatching to the appropriate
functions to respond to each type of query. Note that we write <:sexp_of<string
list>> to autogenerate a function for converting a list of strings to an s-expression, as
described in Chapter 21 (Data Serialization with S-Expressions).
This function ends the denition of the Loader module:
let eval t sexp =
match Or_error.try_with (fun () -> request_of_sexp sexp) with
| Error _ as err -> err
| Ok resp ->
match resp with
| Load (name,config) -> load
t name config
| Unload name
-> unload t name
| Known_services ->
Ok ([%sexp_of: string list] (Hashtbl.keys t.known))
| Active_services ->
Ok ([%sexp_of: string list] (Hashtbl.keys t.active))
end
Finally, we can put this all together with the command-line interface. We rst create
an instance of the loader query handler and then add that instance to the loader's active
table. We can then launch the command-line interface, passing it the active table.

12.3 Living Without First-Class Modules
221
let () =
let loader = Loader.create [(module Unique); (module List_dir)] in
let loader_instance =
(module struct
module Query_handler = Loader
let this = loader
end : Query_handler_instance)
in
Hashtbl.set loader.Loader.active
~key:Loader.name ~data:loader_instance;
cli loader.active
The resulting command-line interface behaves much as you'd expect, starting out
with no query handlers available but giving you the ability to load and unload them.
Here's an example of it in action. As you can see, we start out with loader itself as the
only active handler.
$ dune exec -- ./query_handler_loader.exe
>>> (loader known_services)
(ls unique)
>>> (loader active_services)
(loader)
Any attempt to use an inactive query handler will fail:
>>> (ls .)
Could not find matching handler: ls
But, we can load the ls handler with a cong of our choice, at which point it will be
available for use. And once we unload it, it will be unavailable yet again and could be
reloaded with a dierent cong.
>>> (loader (load ls /var))
()
>>> (ls .)
(agentx at audit backups db empty folders jabberd lib log mail msgs
named
netboot pgsql_socket_alt root rpc run rwho spool tmp vm yp)
>>> (loader (unload ls))
()
>>> (ls .)
Could not find matching handler: ls
Notably, the loader can't be loaded (since it's not on the list of known handlers) and
can't be unloaded either:
>>> (loader (unload loader))
It's unwise to unload yourself
Although we won't describe the details here, we can push this dynamism yet further
using OCaml's dynamic linking facilities, which allow you to compile and link in new
code to a running program. This can be automated using libraries like ocaml_plugin,
which can be installed via OPAM, and which takes care of much of the workow
around setting up dynamic linking.

First-Class Modules
12.3
Living Without First-Class Modules
It's worth noting that most designs that can be done with rst-class modules can be
simulated without them, with some level of awkwardness. For example, we could
rewrite our query handler example without rst-class modules using the following
types:
# type query_handler_instance =
{ name : string
; eval : Sexp.t -> Sexp.t Or_error.t };;
type query_handler_instance = {
name : string;
eval : Sexp.t -> Sexp.t Or_error.t;
}
# type query_handler = Sexp.t -> query_handler_instance;;
type query_handler = Sexp.t -> query_handler_instance
The idea here is that we hide the true types of the objects in question behind the
functions stored in the closure. Thus, we could put the Unique query handler into this
framework as follows:
# let unique_handler config_sexp =
let config = Unique.config_of_sexp config_sexp in
let unique = Unique.create config in
{ name = Unique.name
; eval = (fun config -> Unique.eval unique config)
};;
val unique_handler : Sexp.t -> query_handler_instance = <fun>
For an example on this scale, the preceding approach is completely reasonable, and
rst-class modules are not really necessary. But the more functionality you need to hide
away behind a set of closures, and the more complicated the relationships between the
dierent types in question, the more awkward this approach becomes, and the better it
is to use rst-class modules.

Objects
This chapter was written by Leo White and Jason Hickey.
We've already seen several tools that OCaml provides for organizing programs,
particularly modules. In addition, OCaml also supports object-oriented programming.
There are objects, classes, and their associated types. In this chapter, we'll introduce
you to OCaml objects and subtyping. In the next chapter, Chapter 14 (Classes), we'll
introduce you to classes and inheritance.
What Is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (often shortened to OOP) is a programming style that
encapsulates computation and data within logical objects. Each object contains some
data stored in elds and has method functions that can be invoked against the data
within the object (also called sending a message to the object). The code denition
behind an object is called a class, and objects are constructed from a class denition
by calling a constructor with the data that the object will use to build itself.
There are ve fundamental properties that dierentiate OOP from other styles:
Abstraction The details of the implementation are hidden in the object, and the
external interface is just the set of publicly accessible methods.
Dynamic lookup When a message is sent to an object, the method to be executed is
determined by the implementation of the object, not by some static property of
the program. In other words, dierent objects may react to the same message
in dierent ways.
Subtyping If an object a has all the functionality of an object b, then we may use a in
any context where b is expected.
Inheritance The denition of one kind of object can be reused to produce a new kind
of object. This new denition can override some behavior, but also share code
with its parent.
Open recursion An object's methods can invoke another method in the same object
using a special variable (often called self or this). When objects are created
from classes, these calls use dynamic lookup, allowing a method dened in
one class to invoke methods dened in another class that inherits from the
rst.
Almost every notable modern programming language has been inuenced by OOP,

224
Objects
and you'll have run across these terms if you've ever used C++, Java, C#, Ruby, Python,
or JavaScript.
13.1
OCaml Objects
If you already know about object-oriented programming in a language like Java or C++,
the OCaml object system may come as a surprise. Foremost is the complete separation
of objects and their types from the class system. In a language like Java, a class name
is also used as the type of objects created by instantiating it, and the relationships
between these object types correspond to inheritance. For example, if we implement
a class Deque in Java by inheriting from a class Stack, we would be allowed to pass a
deque anywhere a stack is expected.
OCaml is entirely dierent. Classes are used to construct objects and support inher-
itance, but classes are not types. Instead, objects have object types, and if you want
to use objects, you aren't required to use classes at all. Here's an example of a simple
object:
# open Base;;
# let s = object
val mutable v = [0; 2]
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
end;;
val s : < pop : int option; push : int -> unit > = <obj>
The object has an integer list value v, a method pop that returns the head of v, and a
method push that adds an integer to the head of v.
The object type is enclosed in angle brackets < ... >, containing just the types
of the methods. Fields, like v, are not part of the public interface of an object. All
interaction with an object is through its methods. The syntax for a method invocation
uses the # character:
# s#pop;;
- : int option = Some 0
# s#push 4;;
- : unit = ()
# s#pop;;
- : int option = Some 4
Note that unlike functions, methods can have zero parameters, since the method call
is routed to a concrete object instance. That's why the pop method doesn't have a unit
argument, as the equivalent functional version would.

13.2 Object Polymorphism
225
Objects can also be constructed by functions. If we want to specify the initial value
of the object, we can dene a function that takes the value and returns an object:
# let stack init = object
val mutable v = init
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
end;;
val stack : 'a list -> < pop : 'a option; push : 'a -> unit > = <fun>
# let s = stack [3; 2; 1];;
val s : < pop : int option; push : int -> unit > = <obj>
# s#pop;;
- : int option = Some 3
Note that the types of the function stack and the returned object now use the
polymorphic type 'a. When stack is invoked on a concrete value [3; 2; 1], we get
the same object type as before, with type int for the values on the stack.
13.2
Object Polymorphism
Like polymorphic variants, methods can be used without an explicit type declaration:
# let area sq = sq#width * sq#width;;
val area : < width : int; .. > -> int = <fun>
# let minimize sq : unit = sq#resize 1;;
val minimize : < resize : int -> unit; .. > -> unit = <fun>
# let limit sq = if (area sq) > 100 then minimize sq;;
val limit : < resize : int -> unit; width : int; .. > -> unit = <fun>
As you can see, object types are inferred automatically from the methods that are
invoked on them.
The type system will complain if it sees incompatible uses of the same method:
# let toggle sq b : unit =
if b then sq#resize `Fullscreen else minimize sq;;
Line 2, characters 51-53:
Error: This expression has type < resize : [> `Fullscreen ] -> unit;
.. >
but an expression was expected of type < resize : int -> unit;
.. >
Types for method resize are incompatible
The .. in the inferred object types are ellipses, standing for other unspecied
methods that the object may have. The type < width : float; .. > species an
object that must have at least a width method, and possibly some others as well. Such
object types are said to be open.

226
Objects
We can manually close an object type using a type annotation:
# let area_closed (sq: < width : int >) = sq#width * sq#width;;
val area_closed : < width : int > -> int = <fun>
# let sq = object
method width = 30
method name = "sq"
end;;
val sq : < name : string; width : int > = <obj>
# area_closed sq;;
Line 1, characters 13-15:
Error: This expression has type < name : string; width : int >
but an expression was expected of type < width : int >
The second object type has no method name
Elisions Are Polymorphic
The .. in an open object type is an elision, standing for possibly more methods. It
may not be apparent from the syntax, but an elided object type is actually polymorphic.
For example, if we try to write a type denition, we get an unbound type variable
error:
# type square = < width : int; ..>;;
Line 1, characters 1-33:
Error: A type variable is unbound in this type declaration.
In type < width : Base.int; .. > as 'a the variable 'a is
unbound
This is because .. is really a special kind of type variable called a row variable.
This kind of typing scheme using row variables is called row polymorphism. Row
polymorphism is also used in polymorphic variant types, and there is a close re-
lationship between objects and polymorphic variants: objects are to records what
polymorphic variants are to ordinary variants.
An object of type < pop : int option; .. > can be any object with a method
pop : int option; it doesn't matter how it is implemented. When the method #pop
is invoked, the actual method that is run is determined by the object. Consider the
following function.
# let print_pop st = Option.iter ~f:(Stdio.printf "Popped: %d\n")
st#pop;;
val print_pop : < pop : int option; .. > -> unit = <fun>
We can run it on the stack type we dened above, which is based on linked lists.
# print_pop (stack [5;4;3;2;1]);;
Popped: 5
- : unit = ()
But we could also create a totally dierent implementation of stacks, using Base's
array-based Stack module.
# let array_stack l = object
val stack = Stack.of_list l
method pop = Stack.pop stack

13.4 When to Use Objects
227
end;;
val array_stack : 'a list -> < pop : 'a option > = <fun>
And print_pop will work just as well on this kind of stack object, despite having a
completely dierent implementation.
# print_pop (array_stack [5;4;3;2;1]);;
Popped: 5
- : unit = ()
13.3
Immutable Objects
Many people consider object-oriented programming to be intrinsically imperative,
where an object is like a state machine. Sending a message to an object causes it to
change state, possibly sending messages to other objects.
Indeed, in many programs this makes sense, but it is by no means required. Let's
dene a function that creates immutable stack objects:
# let imm_stack init = object
val v = init
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl -> Some (hd, {< v = tl >})
| [] -> None
method push hd =
{< v = hd :: v >}
end;;
val imm_stack :
'a list -> (< pop : ('a * 'b) option; push : 'a -> 'b > as 'b) = <fun>
The key parts of this implementation are in the pop and push methods. The expression
{< ... >} produces a copy of the current object, with the same type, and the specied
elds updated. In other words, the push hd method produces a copy of the object, with
v replaced by hd :: v. The original object is not modied:
# let s = imm_stack [3; 2; 1];;
val s : < pop : (int * 'a) option; push : int -> 'a > as 'a = <obj>
# let r = s#push 4;;
val r : < pop : (int * 'a) option; push : int -> 'a > as 'a = <obj>
# s#pop;;
- : (int * (< pop : 'a; push : int -> 'b > as 'b)) option as 'a =
Some (3, <obj>)
# r#pop;;
- : (int * (< pop : 'a; push : int -> 'b > as 'b)) option as 'a =
Some (4, <obj>)
There are some restrictions on the use of the expression {< ... >}. It can be used
only within a method body, and only the values of elds may be updated. Method
implementations are xed at the time the object is created; they cannot be changed
dynamically.

13.4
When to Use Objects
You might wonder when to use objects in OCaml, which has a multitude of alternative
mechanisms to express similar concepts. First-class modules are more expressive (a
module can include types, while classes and objects cannot). Modules, functors, and
data types also oer a wide range of ways to express program structure. In fact, many
seasoned OCaml programmers rarely use classes and objects, if at all.
Objects have some advantages over records: they don't require type denitions, and
their support for row polymorphism makes them more exible. However, the heavy
syntax and additional runtime cost means that objects are rarely used in place of
records.
The real benets of objects come from the class system. Classes support inheritance
and open recursion. Open recursion allows interdependent parts of an object to be
dened separately. This works because calls between the methods of an object are
determined when the object is instantiated, a form of late binding. This makes it
possible (and necessary) for one method to refer to other methods in the object without
knowing statically how they will be implemented.
In contrast, modules use early binding. If you want to parameterize your module
code so that some part of it can be implemented later, you would write a function or
functor. This is more explicit, but often more verbose than overriding a method in a
class.
In general, a rule of thumb is: use classes and objects in situations where open
recursion is a big win. Two good examples are Xavier Leroy's Cryptokit1, which
provides a variety of cryptographic primitives that can be combined in building-block
style; and the Camlimages2 library, which manipulates various graphical le formats.
Camlimages also provides a module-based version of the same library, letting you
choose between functional and object-oriented styles depending on your problem
domain.
We'll introduce you to classes, and examples using open recursion, in Chapter 14
(Classes).
13.5
Subtyping
Subtyping is a central concept in object-oriented programming. It governs when an
object with one type A can be used in an expression that expects an object of another
type B. When this is true, we say that A is a subtype of B. More concretely, subtyping
restricts when the coercion operator e :> t can be applied. This coercion works only
if the type of e is a subtype of t.

13.5 Depth Subtyping
229
13.5.1
Width Subtyping
To explore this, let's dene some simple object types for geometric shapes. The generic
type shape just has a method to compute the area.
# type shape = < area : float >;;
type shape = < area : float >
Now let's add a type representing a specic kind of shape, as well as a function for
creating objects of that type.
# type square = < area : float; width : int >;;
type square = < area : float; width : int >
# let square w = object
method area = Float.of_int (w * w)
method width = w
end;;
val square : int -> < area : float; width : int > = <fun>
A square has a method area just like a shape, and an additional method width. Still,
we expect a square to be a shape, and it is. Note, however, that the coercion :> must
be explicit:
# (square 10 : shape);;
Line 1, characters 2-11:
Error: This expression has type < area : float; width : int >
but an expression was expected of type shape
The second object type has no method width
# (square 10 :> shape);;
- : shape = <obj>
This form of object subtyping is called width subtyping. Width subtyping means
that an object type A is a subtype of B, if A has all of the methods of B, and possibly
more. A square is a subtype of shape because it implements all of the methods of
shape, which in this case means the area method.
13.5.2
Depth Subtyping
We can also use depth subtyping with objects. Depth subtyping allows us to coerce an
object if its individual methods could safely be coerced. So an object type < m: t1 >
is a subtype of < m: t2 > if t1 is a subtype of t2.
First, let's add a new shape type, circle:
# type circle = < area : float; radius : int >;;
type circle = < area : float; radius : int >
# let circle r = object
method area = 3.14 *. (Float.of_int r) **. 2.0
method radius = r
end;;
val circle : int -> < area : float; radius : int > = <fun>
Using that, let's create a couple of objects that each have a shape method, one
returning a shape of type circle:

230
Objects
# let coin = object
method shape = circle 5
method color = "silver"
end;;
val coin : < color : string; shape : < area : float; radius : int > >
= <obj>
And the other returning a shape of type square:
# let map = object
method shape = square 10
end;;
val map : < shape : < area : float; width : int > > = <obj>
Both these objects have a shape method whose type is a subtype of the shape type,
so they can both be coerced into the object type < shape : shape >:
# type item = < shape : shape >;;
type item = < shape : shape >
# let items = [ (coin :> item) ; (map :> item) ];;
val items : item list = [<obj>; <obj>]
Polymorphic Variant Subtyping
Subtyping can also be used to coerce a polymorphic variant into a larger polymorphic
variant type. A polymorphic variant type A is a subtype of B, if the tags of A are a
subset of the tags of B:
# type num = [ `Int of int | `Float of float ];;
type num = [ `Float of float | `Int of int ]
# type const = [ num | `String of string ];;
type const = [ `Float of float | `Int of int | `String of string ]
# let n : num = `Int 3;;
val n : num = `Int 3
# let c : const = (n :> const);;
val c : const = `Int 3
13.5.3
Variance
What about types built from object types? If a square is a shape, we expect a square
list to be a shape list. OCaml does indeed allow such coercions:
# let squares: square list = [ square 10; square 20 ];;
val squares : square list = [<obj>; <obj>]
# let shapes: shape list = (squares :> shape list);;
val shapes : shape list = [<obj>; <obj>]
Note that this relies on lists being immutable. It would not be safe to treat a square
array as a shape array because it would allow you to store non-square shapes into
what should be an array of squares. OCaml recognizes this and does not allow the
coercion:
# let square_array: square array = [| square 10; square 20 |];;
val square_array : square array = [|<obj>; <obj>|]

13.5 Variance Annotations
231
# let shape_array: shape array = (square_array :> shape array);;
Line 1, characters 32-61:
Error: Type square array is not a subtype of shape array
The second object type has no method width
We say that 'a list is covariant (in 'a), while 'a array is invariant.
Subtyping function types requires a third class of variance. A function with type
square -> string cannot be used with type shape -> string because it expects its
argument to be a square and would not know what to do with a circle. However, a
function with type shape -> string can safely be used with type square -> string:
# let shape_to_string: shape -> string =
fun s -> Printf.sprintf "Shape(%F)" s#area;;
val shape_to_string : shape -> string = <fun>
# let square_to_string: square -> string =
(shape_to_string :> square -> string);;
val square_to_string : square -> string = <fun>
We say that 'a -> string is contravariant in 'a. In general, function types are con-
travariant in their arguments and covariant in their results.
Variance Annotations
OCaml works out the variance of a type using that type's denition. Consider the
following simple immutable Either type.
# module Either = struct
type ('a, 'b) t =
| Left of 'a
| Right of 'b
let left x = Left x
let right x = Right x
end;;
module Either :
sig
type ('a, 'b) t = Left of 'a | Right of 'b
val left : 'a -> ('a, 'b) t
val right : 'a -> ('b, 'a) t
end
By looking at what coercions are allowed, we can see that the type parameters of the
immutable Either type are covariant.
# let left_square = Either.left (square 40);;
val left_square : (< area : float; width : int >, 'a) Either.t =
Either.Left <obj>
# (left_square :> (shape,_) Either.t);;
- : (shape, 'a) Either.t = Either.Left <obj>
The story is dierent, however, if the denition is hidden by a signature.
# module Abs_either : sig
type ('a, 'b) t
val left: 'a -> ('a, 'b) t
val right: 'b -> ('a, 'b) t
end = Either;;
module Abs_either :

232
Objects
sig
type ('a, 'b) t
val left : 'a -> ('a, 'b) t
val right : 'b -> ('a, 'b) t
end
In this case, OCaml is forced to assume that the type is invariant.
# (Abs_either.left (square 40) :> (shape, _) Abs_either.t);;
Line 1, characters 2-29:
Error: This expression cannot be coerced to type (shape, 'b)
Abs_either.t;
it has type (< area : float; width : int >, 'a) Abs_either.t
but is here used with type (shape, 'b) Abs_either.t
Type < area : float; width : int > is not compatible with type
shape = < area : float >
The second object type has no method width
We can x this by adding variance annotations to the type's parameters in the
signature: + for covariance or - for contravariance:
# module Var_either : sig
type (+'a, +'b) t
val left: 'a -> ('a, 'b) t
val right: 'b -> ('a, 'b) t
end = Either;;
module Var_either :
sig
type (+'a, +'b) t
val left : 'a -> ('a, 'b) t
val right : 'b -> ('a, 'b) t
end
As you can see, this now allows the coercion once again.
# (Var_either.left (square 40) :> (shape, _) Var_either.t);;
- : (shape, 'a) Var_either.t = <abstr>
For a more concrete example of variance, let's create some stacks containing shapes
by applying our stack function to some squares and some circles:
# type 'a stack = < pop: 'a option; push: 'a -> unit >;;
type 'a stack = < pop : 'a option; push : 'a -> unit >
# let square_stack: square stack = stack [square 30; square 10];;
val square_stack : square stack = <obj>
# let circle_stack: circle stack = stack [circle 20; circle 40];;
val circle_stack : circle stack = <obj>
If we wanted to write a function that took a list of such stacks and found the total
area of their shapes, we might try:
# let total_area (shape_stacks: shape stack list) =
let stack_area acc st =
let rec loop acc =
match st#pop with
| Some s -> loop (acc +. s#area)
| None -> acc
in

13.5 Variance Annotations
233
loop acc
in
List.fold ~init:0.0 ~f:stack_area shape_stacks;;
val total_area : shape stack list -> float = <fun>
However, when we try to apply this function to our objects, we get an error:
# total_area [(square_stack :> shape stack); (circle_stack :> shape
stack)];;
Line 1, characters 13-42:
Error: Type square stack = < pop : square option; push : square ->
unit >
is not a subtype of
shape stack = < pop : shape option; push : shape -> unit >
Type shape = < area : float > is not a subtype of
square = < area : float; width : int >
The first object type has no method width
As you can see, square stack and circle stack are not subtypes of shape stack.
The problem is with the push method. For shape stack, the push method takes an
arbitrary shape. So if we could coerce a square stack to a shape stack, then it would
be possible to push an arbitrary shape onto square stack, which would be an error.
Another way of looking at this is that < push: 'a -> unit; .. > is contravariant
in 'a, so < push: square -> unit; pop: square option > cannot be a subtype of
< push: shape -> unit; pop: shape option >.
Still, the total_area function should be ne, in principle. It doesn't call push, so it
isn't making that error. To make it work, we need to use a more precise type that indi-
cates we are not going to be using the push method. We dene a type readonly_stack
and conrm that we can coerce the list of stacks to it:
# type 'a readonly_stack = < pop : 'a option >;;
type 'a readonly_stack = < pop : 'a option >
# let total_area (shape_stacks: shape readonly_stack list) =
let stack_area acc st =
let rec loop acc =
match st#pop with
| Some s -> loop (acc +. s#area)
| None -> acc
in
loop acc
in
List.fold ~init:0.0 ~f:stack_area shape_stacks;;
val total_area : shape readonly_stack list -> float = <fun>
# total_area [(square_stack :> shape readonly_stack); (circle_stack :>
shape readonly_stack)];;
- : float = 7280.
Aspects of this section may seem fairly complicated, but it should be pointed out
that this typing works, and in the end, the type annotations are fairly minor. In most
typed object-oriented languages, these coercions would simply not be possible. For
example, in C++, a STL type list<T> is invariant in T, so it is simply not possible
to use list<square> where list<shape> is expected (at least safely). The situation
is similar in Java, although Java has an escape hatch that allows the program to fall

234
Objects
back to dynamic typing. The situation in OCaml is much better: it works, it is statically
checked, and the annotations are pretty simple.
13.5.4
Narrowing
Narrowing, also called down casting, is the ability to coerce an object to one of its
subtypes. For example, if we have a list of shapes shape list, we might know (for
some reason) what the actual type of each shape is. Perhaps we know that all objects
in the list have type square. In this case, narrowing would allow the recasting of the
object from type shape to type square. Many languages support narrowing through
dynamic type checking. For example, in Java, a coercion (Square) x is allowed if
the value x has type Square or one of its subtypes; otherwise the coercion throws an
exception.
Narrowing is not permitted in OCaml. Period.
Why? There are two reasonable explanations, one based on a design principle, and
another technical (the technical reason is simple: it is hard to implement).
The design argument is this: narrowing violates abstraction. In fact, with a struc-
tural typing system like in OCaml, narrowing would essentially provide the ability to
enumerate the methods in an object. To check whether an object obj has some method
foo : int, one would attempt a coercion (obj :> < foo : int >).
More pragmatically, narrowing leads to poor object-oriented style. Consider the
following Java code, which returns the name of a shape object:
String GetShapeName(Shape s) {
if (s instanceof Square) {
return "Square";
} else if (s instanceof Circle) {
return "Circle";
} else {
return "Other";
}
}
Most programmers would consider this code to be awkward, at the least. Instead of
performing a case analysis on the type of object, it would be better to dene a method
to return the name of the shape. Instead of calling GetShapeName(s), we should call
s.Name() instead.
However, the situation is not always so obvious. The following code checks whether
an array of shapes looks like a barbell, composed of two Circle objects separated by
a Line, where the circles have the same radius:
boolean IsBarbell(Shape[] s) {
return s.length == 3 && (s[0] instanceof Circle) &&
(s[1] instanceof Line) && (s[2] instanceof Circle) &&
((Circle) s[0]).radius() == ((Circle) s[2]).radius();
}
In this case, it is much less clear how to augment the Shape class to support this
kind of pattern analysis. It is also not obvious that object-oriented programming is
well-suited for this situation. Pattern matching seems like a better t:

13.5 Subtyping Versus Row Polymorphism
235
# type shape = Circle of { radius : int } | Line of { length: int };;
type shape = Circle of { radius : int; } | Line of { length : int; }
# let is_barbell = function
| [Circle {radius=r1}; Line _; Circle {radius=r2}] when r1 = r2 ->
true
| _ -> false;;
val is_barbell : shape list -> bool = <fun>
Regardless, there is a solution if you nd yourself in this situation, which is to
augment the classes with variants. You can dene a method variant that injects the
actual object into a variant type.
# type shape = < variant : repr >
and circle = < variant : repr; radius : int >
and line = < variant : repr; length : int >
and repr =
| Circle of circle
| Line of line;;
type shape = < variant : repr >
and circle = < radius : int; variant : repr >
and line = < length : int; variant : repr >
and repr = Circle of circle | Line of line
# let is_barbell = function
| [s1; s2; s3] ->
(match s1#variant, s2#variant, s3#variant with
| Circle c1, Line _, Circle c2 when c1#radius = c2#radius ->
true
| _ -> false)
| _ -> false;;
val is_barbell : < variant : repr; .. > list -> bool = <fun>
This pattern works, but it has drawbacks. In particular, the recursive type denition
should make it clear that this pattern is essentially equivalent to using variants, and
that objects do not provide much value here.
13.5.5
Subtyping Versus Row Polymorphism
There is considerable overlap between subtyping and row polymorphism. Both mecha-
nisms allow you to write functions that can be applied to objects of dierent types. In
these cases, row polymorphism is usually preferred over subtyping because it does not
require explicit coercions, and it preserves more type information, allowing functions
like the following:
# let remove_large l =
List.filter ~f:(fun s -> Float.(s#area <= 100.)) l;;
val remove_large : (< area : float; .. > as 'a) list -> 'a list = <fun>
The return type of this function is built from the open object type of its argument,
preserving any additional methods that it may have, as we can see below.
# let squares : < area : float; width : int > list =
[square 5; square 15; square 10];;
val squares : < area : float; width : int > list = [<obj>; <obj>;
<obj>]

236
Objects
# remove_large squares;;
- : < area : float; width : int > list = [<obj>; <obj>]
Writing a similar function with a closed type and applying it using subtyping does
not preserve the methods of the argument: the returned object is only known to have
an area method:
# let remove_large (l: < area : float > list) =
List.filter ~f:(fun s -> Float.(s#area <= 100.)) l;;
val remove_large : < area : float > list -> < area : float > list =
<fun>
# remove_large (squares :> < area : float > list );;
- : < area : float > list = [<obj>; <obj>]
There are some situations where we cannot use row polymorphism. In particular,
row polymorphism cannot be used to place dierent types of objects in the same
container. For example, lists of heterogeneous elements cannot be created using row
polymorphism:
# let hlist: < area: float; ..> list = [square 10; circle 30];;
Line 1, characters 50-59:
Error: This expression has type < area : float; radius : int >
but an expression was expected of type < area : float; width :
int >
The second object type has no method radius
Similarly, we cannot use row polymorphism to store dierent types of object in the
same reference:
# let shape_ref: < area: float; ..> ref = ref (square 40);;
val shape_ref : < area : float; width : int > ref =
{Base.Ref.contents = <obj>}
# shape_ref := circle 20;;
Line 1, characters 14-23:
Error: This expression has type < area : float; radius : int >
but an expression was expected of type < area : float; width :
int >
The second object type has no method radius
In both these cases we must use subtyping:
# let hlist: shape list = [(square 10 :> shape); (circle 30 :>
shape)];;
val hlist : shape list = [<obj>; <obj>]
# let shape_ref: shape ref = ref (square 40 :> shape);;
val shape_ref : shape ref = {Base.Ref.contents = <obj>}
# shape_ref := (circle 20 :> shape);;
- : unit = ()

Classes
This chapter was written by Leo White and Jason Hickey.
Programming with objects directly is great for encapsulation, but one of the main
goals of object-oriented programming is code reuse through inheritance. For inheri-
tance, we need to introduce classes. In object-oriented programming, a class is essen-
tially a recipe for creating objects. The recipe can be changed by adding new methods
and elds, or it can be changed by modifying existing methods.
14.1
OCaml Classes
In OCaml, class denitions must be dened as toplevel statements in a module. The
syntax for a class denition uses the keyword class:
# open Base;;
# class istack = object
val mutable v = [0; 2]
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
end;;
class istack :
object
val mutable v : int list
method pop : int option
method push : int -> unit
end
The class istack : object ... end result shows that we have created a class
istack with class type object ... end. Like module types, class types are completely
separate from regular OCaml types (e.g., int, string, and list) and, in particular,
should not be confused with object types (e.g., < get : int; .. >). The class type
describes the class itself rather than the objects that the class creates. This particular

238
Classes
class type species that the istack class denes a mutable eld v, a method pop that
returns an int option, and a method push with type int -> unit.
To produce an object, classes are instantiated with the keyword new:
# let s = new istack;;
val s : istack = <obj>
# s#pop;;
- : int option = Some 0
# s#push 5;;
- : unit = ()
# s#pop;;
- : int option = Some 5
You may have noticed that the object s has been given the type istack. But wait,
we've stressed classes are not types, so what's up with that? In fact, what we've said
is entirely true: classes and class names are not types. However, for convenience, the
denition of the class istack also denes an object type istack with the same methods
as the class. This type denition is equivalent to:
# type istack = < pop: int option; push: int -> unit >;;
type istack = < pop : int option; push : int -> unit >
Note that this type represents any object with these methods: objects created using
the istack class will have this type, but objects with this type may not have been
created by the istack class.
14.2
Class Parameters and Polymorphism
A class denition serves as the constructor for the class. In general, a class denition
may have parameters that must be provided as arguments when the object is created
with new.
Let's implement a variant of the istack class that can hold any values, not just
integers. When dening the class, the type parameters are placed in square brackets
before the class name in the class denition. We also add a parameter init for the
initial contents of the stack:
# class ['a] stack init = object
val mutable v : 'a list = init
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
end;;
class ['a] stack :
'a list ->

14.3 Object Types as Interfaces
239
object
val mutable v : 'a list
method pop : 'a option
method push : 'a -> unit
end
Note that the type parameter ['a] in the denition uses square brackets, but for
other uses of the type they are omitted (or replaced with parentheses if there is more
than one type parameter).
The type annotation on the declaration of v is used to constrain type inference. If
we omit this annotation, the type inferred for the class will be too polymorphic: init
could have some type 'b list:
# class ['a] stack init = object
val mutable v = init
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
end;;
Lines 1-13, characters 1-6:
Error: Some type variables are unbound in this type:
class ['a] stack :
'b list ->
object
val mutable v : 'b list
method pop : 'b option
method push : 'b -> unit
end
The method pop has type 'b option where 'b is unbound
In general, we need to provide enough constraints so that the compiler will infer the
correct type. We can add type constraints to the parameters, to the elds, and to the
methods. It is a matter of preference how many constraints to add. You can add type
constraints in all three places, but the extra text may not help clarity. A convenient
middle ground is to annotate the elds and/or class parameters, and add constraints to
methods only if necessary.
14.3
Object Types as Interfaces
We may wish to traverse the elements on our stack. One common style for doing this
in object-oriented languages is to dene a class for an iterator object. An iterator
provides a generic mechanism to inspect and traverse the elements of a collection.
There are two common styles for dening abstract interfaces like this. In Java, an

240
Classes
iterator would normally be specied with an interface, which species a set of method
types:
// Java-style iterator, specified as an interface.
interface <T> iterator {
T Get();
boolean HasValue();
void Next();
};
In languages without interfaces, like C++, the specication would normally use
abstract classes to specify the methods without implementing them (C++ uses the =
0 denition to mean not implemented):
// Abstract class definition in C++.
template<typename T>
class Iterator {
public:
virtual ~Iterator() {}
virtual T get() const = 0;
virtual bool has_value() const = 0;
virtual void next() = 0;
};
OCaml supports both styles. In fact, OCaml is more exible than these approaches
because an object type can be implemented by any object with the appropriate methods;
it does not have to be specied by the object's class a priori. We'll leave abstract classes
for later. Let's demonstrate the technique using object types.
First, we'll dene an object type iterator that species the methods in an iterator:
# type 'a iterator = < get : 'a; has_value : bool; next : unit >;;
type 'a iterator = < get : 'a; has_value : bool; next : unit >
Next, we'll dene an actual iterator for lists. We can use this to iterate over the
contents of our stack:
# class ['a] list_iterator init = object
val mutable current : 'a list = init
method has_value = not (List.is_empty current)
method get =
match current with
| hd :: tl -> hd
| [] -> raise (Invalid_argument "no value")
method next =
match current with
| hd :: tl -> current <- tl
| [] -> raise (Invalid_argument "no value")
end;;
class ['a] list_iterator :
'a list ->
object
val mutable current : 'a list
method get : 'a

14.3 Functional Iterators
241
method has_value : bool
method next : unit
end
Finally, we add a method iterator to the stack class to produce an iterator. To do
so, we construct a list_iterator that refers to the current contents of the stack:
# class ['a] stack init = object
val mutable v : 'a list = init
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
method iterator : 'a iterator =
new list_iterator v
end;;
class ['a] stack :
'a list ->
object
val mutable v : 'a list
method iterator : 'a iterator
method pop : 'a option
method push : 'a -> unit
end
Now we can build a new stack, push some values to it, and iterate over them:
# let s = new stack [];;
val s : '_weak1 stack = <obj>
# s#push 5;;
- : unit = ()
# s#push 4;;
- : unit = ()
# let it = s#iterator;;
val it : int iterator = <obj>
# it#get;;
- : int = 4
# it#next;;
- : unit = ()
# it#get;;
- : int = 5
# it#next;;
- : unit = ()
# it#has_value;;
- : bool = false

242
Classes
14.3.1
Functional Iterators
In practice, most OCaml programmers avoid iterator objects in favor of functional-style
techniques. For example, the alternative stack class that follows takes a function f and
applies it to each of the elements on the stack:
# class ['a] stack init = object
val mutable v : 'a list = init
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
method iter f =
List.iter ~f v
end;;
class ['a] stack :
'a list ->
object
val mutable v : 'a list
method iter : ('a -> unit) -> unit
method pop : 'a option
method push : 'a -> unit
end
What about functional operations like map and fold? In general, these methods take
a function that produces a value of some other type than the elements of the set.
For example, a fold method for our ['a] stack class should have type ('b -> 'a
-> 'b) -> 'b -> 'b, where the 'b is polymorphic. To express a polymorphic method
type like this, we must use a type quantier, as shown in the following example:
# class ['a] stack init = object
val mutable v : 'a list = init
method pop =
match v with
| hd :: tl ->
v <- tl;
Some hd
| [] -> None
method push hd =
v <- hd :: v
method fold : 'b. ('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b -> 'b =
(fun f init -> List.fold ~f ~init v)
end;;
class ['a] stack :
'a list ->
object

14.5 Class Types
243
val mutable v : 'a list
method fold : ('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b -> 'b
method pop : 'a option
method push : 'a -> unit
end
The type quantier 'b. can be read as for all 'b. Type quantiers can only be
used directly after the method name, which means that method parameters must be
expressed using a fun or function expression.
14.4
Inheritance
Inheritance uses an existing class to dene a new one. For example, the following class
denition inherits from our stack class for strings and adds a new method print that
prints all the strings on the stack:
# class sstack init = object
inherit [string] stack init
method print =
List.iter ~f:Stdio.print_endline v
end;;
class sstack :
string list ->
object
val mutable v : string list
method pop : string option
method print : unit
method push : string -> unit
end
A class can override methods from classes it inherits. For example, this class creates
stacks of integers that double the integers before they are pushed onto the stack:
# class double_stack init = object
inherit [int] stack init as super
method push hd =
super#push (hd * 2)
end;;
class double_stack :
int list ->
object
val mutable v : int list
method pop : int option
method push : int -> unit
end
The preceding as super statement creates a special object called super which can
be used to call superclass methods. Note that super is not a real object and can only
be used to call methods.

244
Classes
14.5
Class Types
To allow code in a dierent le or module to inherit from a class, we must expose it
and give it a class type. What is the class type?
As an example, let's wrap up our stack class in an explicit module (we'll use explicit
modules for illustration, but the process is similar when we want to dene a .mli le).
In keeping with the usual style for modules, we dene a type 'a t to represent the type
of our stacks:
module Stack = struct
class ['a] stack init = object
...
end
type 'a t = 'a stack
let make init = new stack init
end
We have multiple choices in dening the module type, depending on how much of
the implementation we want to expose. At one extreme, a maximally abstract signature
would completely hide the class denitions:
module AbstractStack : sig
type 'a t = < pop: 'a option; push: 'a -> unit >
val make : 'a list -> 'a t
end = Stack
The abstract signature is simple because we ignore the classes. But what if we
want to include them in the signature so that other modules can inherit from the class
denitions? For this, we need to specify types for the classes, called class types.
Class types do not appear in mainstream object-oriented programming languages,
so you may not be familiar with them, but the concept is pretty simple. A class type
species the type of each of the visible parts of the class, including both elds and
methods. Just as with module types, you don't have to give a type for everything;
anything you omit will be hidden:
module VisibleStack : sig
type 'a t = < pop: 'a option; push: 'a -> unit >
class ['a] stack : object
val mutable v : 'a list
method pop : 'a option
method push : 'a -> unit
end
val make : 'a list -> 'a t
end = Stack
In this signature, we've chosen to make everything visible. The class type for stack
species the types of the eld v, as well as the types of each of the methods.

14.6 Open Recursion
245
14.6
Open Recursion
Open recursion allows an object's methods to invoke other methods on the same object.
These calls are looked up dynamically, allowing a method in one class to call a method
from another class, if both classes are inherited by the same object. This allows mutually
recursive parts of an object to be dened separately.
This ability to dene mutually recursive methods from separate components is a
key feature of classes: achieving similar functionality with data types or modules is
much more cumbersome and verbose.
For example, consider writing recursive functions over a simple document format.
This format is represented as a tree with three dierent types of node:
type doc =
| Heading of string
| Paragraph of text_item list
| Definition of string list_item list
and text_item =
| Raw of string
| Bold of text_item list
| Enumerate of int list_item list
| Quote of doc
and 'a list_item =
{ tag: 'a;
text: text_item list }
It is quite easy to write a function that operates by recursively traversing this data.
However, what if you need to write many similar recursive functions? How can you
factor out the common parts of these functions to avoid repetitive boilerplate?
The simplest way is to use classes and open recursion. For example, the following
class denes objects that fold over the document data:
class ['a] folder = object(self)
method doc acc = function
| Heading _ -> acc
| Paragraph text -> List.fold ~f:self#text_item ~init:acc text
| Definition list -> List.fold ~f:self#list_item ~init:acc list
method list_item: 'b. 'a -> 'b list_item -> 'a =
fun acc {tag; text} ->
List.fold ~f:self#text_item ~init:acc text
method text_item acc = function
| Raw _ -> acc
| Bold text -> List.fold ~f:self#text_item ~init:acc text
| Enumerate list -> List.fold ~f:self#list_item ~init:acc list
| Quote doc -> self#doc acc doc
end
The object (self) syntax binds self to the current object, allowing the doc,
list_item, and text_item methods to call each other.
By inheriting from this class, we can create functions that fold over the document

246
Classes
data. For example, the count_doc function counts the number of bold tags in the
document that are not within a list:
class counter = object
inherit [int] folder as super
method list_item acc li = acc
method text_item acc ti =
let acc = super#text_item acc ti in
match ti with
| Bold _ -> acc + 1
| _ -> acc
end
let count_doc = (new counter)#doc
Note how the super special object is used in text_item to call the [int] folder
class's text_item method to fold over the children of the text_item node.
14.7
Private Methods
Methods can be declared private, which means that they may be called by subclasses,
but they are not visible otherwise (similar to a protected method in C++).
For example, we may want to include methods in our folder class for handling
each of the dierent cases in doc and text_item. However, we may not want to force
subclasses of folder to expose these methods, as they probably shouldn't be called
directly:
class ['a] folder2 = object(self)
method doc acc = function
| Heading str -> self#heading acc str
| Paragraph text -> self#paragraph acc text
| Definition list -> self#definition acc list
method list_item: 'b. 'a -> 'b list_item -> 'a =
fun acc {tag; text} ->
List.fold ~f:self#text_item ~init:acc text
method text_item acc = function
| Raw str -> self#raw acc str
| Bold text -> self#bold acc text
| Enumerate list -> self#enumerate acc list
| Quote doc -> self#quote acc doc
method private heading acc str = acc
method private paragraph acc text =
List.fold ~f:self#text_item ~init:acc text
method private definition acc list =
List.fold ~f:self#list_item ~init:acc list
method private raw acc str = acc
method private bold acc text =

14.8 Binary Methods
247
List.fold ~f:self#text_item ~init:acc text
method private enumerate acc list =
List.fold ~f:self#list_item ~init:acc list
method private quote acc doc = self#doc acc doc
end
let f :
< doc : int -> doc -> int;
list_item : 'a . int -> 'a list_item -> int;
text_item : int -> text_item -> int >
= new folder2
The nal statement that builds the value f shows how the instantiation of a folder2
object has a type that hides the private methods.
To be precise, the private methods are part of the class type, but not part of the object
type. This means, for example, that the object f has no method bold. However, the
private methods are available to subclasses: we can use them to simplify our counter
class:
class counter_with_private_method = object
inherit [int] folder2 as super
method list_item acc li = acc
method private bold acc txt =
let acc = super#bold acc txt in
acc + 1
end
The key property of private methods is that they are visible to subclasses, but not
anywhere else. If you want the stronger guarantee that a method is really private, not
even accessible in subclasses, you can use an explicit class type that omits the method.
In the following code, the private methods are explicitly omitted from the class type of
counter_with_sig and can't be invoked in subclasses of counter_with_sig:
class counter_with_sig : object
method doc : int -> doc -> int
method list_item : int -> 'b list_item -> int
method text_item : int -> text_item -> int
end = object
inherit [int] folder2 as super
method list_item acc li = acc
method private bold acc txt =
let acc = super#bold acc txt in
acc + 1
end
14.8
Binary Methods
A binary method is a method that takes an object of self type. One common example
is dening a method for equality:

248
Classes
# class square w = object(self : 'self)
method width = w
method area = Float.of_int (self#width * self#width)
method equals (other : 'self) = other#width = self#width
end;;
class square :
int ->
object ('a)
method area : float
method equals : 'a -> bool
method width : int
end
# class circle r = object(self : 'self)
method radius = r
method area = 3.14 *. (Float.of_int self#radius) **. 2.0
method equals (other : 'self) = other#radius = self#radius
end;;
class circle :
int ->
object ('a)
method area : float
method equals : 'a -> bool
method radius : int
end
Note how we can use the type annotation (self: 'self) to obtain the type of the
current object.
We can now test dierent object instances for equality by using the equals binary
method:
# (new square 5)#equals (new square 5);;
- : bool = true
# (new circle 10)#equals (new circle 7);;
- : bool = false
This works, but there is a problem lurking here. The method equals takes an object
of the exact type square or circle. Because of this, we can't dene a common base
class shape that also includes an equality method:
# type shape = < equals : shape -> bool; area : float >;;
type shape = < area : float; equals : shape -> bool >
# (new square 5 :> shape);;
Line 1, characters 1-24:
Error: Type square = < area : float; equals : square -> bool; width :
int >
is not a subtype of shape = < area : float; equals : shape ->
bool >
Type shape = < area : float; equals : shape -> bool >
is not a subtype of
square = < area : float; equals : square -> bool; width :
int >
The first object type has no method width
The problem is that a square expects to be compared with a square, not an arbitrary
shape; likewise for circle. This problem is fundamental. Many languages solve it

14.8 Binary Methods
249
either with narrowing (with dynamic type checking), or by method overloading. Since
OCaml has neither of these, what can we do?
Since the problematic method is equality, one proposal we could consider is to just
drop it from the base type shape and use polymorphic equality instead. However, the
built-in polymorphic equality has very poor behavior when applied to objects:
# Poly.(=)
(object method area = 5 end)
(object method area = 5 end);;
- : bool = false
The problem here is that two objects are considered equal by the built-in polymorphic
equality if and only if they are physically equal. There are other reasons not to use the
built-in polymorphic equality, but these false negatives are a showstopper.
If we want to dene equality for shapes in general, the remaining solution is to use the
same approach as we described for narrowing. That is, introduce a representation type
implemented using variants, and implement the comparison based on the representation
type:
# type shape_repr =
| Square of int
| Circle of int;;
type shape_repr = Square of int | Circle of int
# type shape =
< repr : shape_repr; equals : shape -> bool; area : float >;;
type shape = < area : float; equals : shape -> bool; repr :
shape_repr >
# class square w = object(self)
method width = w
method area = Float.of_int (self#width * self#width)
method repr = Square self#width
method equals (other : shape) =
match (self#repr, other#repr) with
| Square x, Square x' -> Int.(=) x x'
| _ -> false
end;;
class square :
int ->
object
method area : float
method equals : shape -> bool
method repr : shape_repr
method width : int
end
The binary method equals is now implemented in terms of the concrete type
shape_repr. When using this pattern, you will not be able to hide the repr method,
but you can hide the type denition using the module system:
module Shapes : sig
type shape_repr
type shape =
< repr : shape_repr; equals : shape -> bool; area: float >
class square : int ->

250
Classes
object
method width : int
method area : float
method repr : shape_repr
method equals : shape -> bool
end
end = struct
type shape_repr =
| Square of int
| Circle of int
...
end
Note that this solution prevents us from adding new kinds of shapes without adding
new constructors to the shape_repr type, which is quite restrictive. We can x this,
however, by using OCaml's rarely-used but still useful extensible variants.
Extensible variants let you separate the denition of a variant type from the denition
of its constructors. The resulting type is by denition open, in the sense that new variants
can always be added. As a result, the compiler can't check whether pattern matching
on such a variant is exhaustive. Happily, exhaustivity is not what we need here.
Here's how we'd rewrite the above example with extensible variants.
# type shape_repr = ..;;
type shape_repr = ..
# type shape =
< repr : shape_repr; equals : shape -> bool; area : float >;;
type shape = < area : float; equals : shape -> bool; repr :
shape_repr >
# type shape_repr += Square of int;;
type shape_repr += Square of int
# class square w = object(self)
method width = w
method area = Float.of_int (self#width * self#width)
method repr = Square self#width
method equals (other : shape) =
match (self#repr, other#repr) with
| Square x, Square x' -> Int.(=) x x'
| _ -> false
end;;
class square :
int ->
object
method area : float
method equals : shape -> bool
method repr : shape_repr
method width : int
end
One oddity of the representation type approach is that the objects created by these
classes are in one-to-one correspondence with members of the representation type,
making the objects seem somewhat redundant.
But equality is an extreme instance of a binary method: it needs access to all
the information of the other object. Many other binary methods need only partial

14.9 Create Some Simple Shapes
251
information about the object. For instance, consider a method that compares shapes by
their sizes:
# class square w = object(self)
method width = w
method area = Float.of_int (self#width * self#width)
method larger (other : shape) = Float.(self#area > other#area)
end;;
class square :
int ->
object
method area : float
method larger : shape -> bool
method width : int
end
The larger method can be used on a square, but it can also be applied to any object
of type shape.
14.9
Virtual Classes and Methods
A virtual class is a class where some methods or elds are declared but not implemented.
This should not be confused with the word virtual as it is used in C++. A virtual
method in C++ uses dynamic dispatch, while regular, nonvirtual methods are statically
dispatched. In OCaml, all methods use dynamic dispatch, but the keyword virtual
means that the method or eld is not implemented. A class containing virtual methods
must also be agged virtual and cannot be directly instantiated (i.e., no object of this
class can be created).
To explore this, let's extend our shapes examples to simple, interactive graphics.
We will use the Async concurrency library and the Async_graphics1 library, which
provides an asynchronous interface to OCaml's built-in Graphics library. Concurrent
programming with Async will be explored later in Chapter 17 (Concurrent Program-
ming with Async); for now you can safely ignore the details. You just need to run
opam install async_graphics to get the library installed on your system.
We will give each shape a draw method that describes how to draw the shape on the
Async_graphics display:
open Core
open Async
open Async_graphics
type drawable = < draw: unit >
14.9.1
Create Some Simple Shapes
Now let's add classes for making squares and circles. We include an on_click method
for adding event handlers to the shapes:
1 http://github.com/lpw25/async_graphics/

252
Classes
class square w x y = object(self)
val mutable x: int = x
method x = x
val mutable y: int = y
method y = y
val mutable width = w
method width = width
method draw = fill_rect x y width width
method private contains x' y' =
x <= x' && x' <= x + width &&
y <= y' && y' <= y + width
method on_click ?start ?stop f =
on_click ?start ?stop
(fun ev ->
if self#contains ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y then
f ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y)
end
The square class is pretty straightforward, and the circle class below also looks
very similar:
class circle r x y = object(self)
val mutable x: int = x
method x = x
val mutable y: int = y
method y = y
val mutable radius = r
method radius = radius
method draw = fill_circle x y radius
method private contains x' y' =
let dx = x' - x in
let dy = y' - y in
dx * dx + dy * dy <= radius * radius
method on_click ?start ?stop f =
on_click ?start ?stop
(fun ev ->
if self#contains ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y then
f ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y)
end
These classes have a lot in common, and it would be useful to factor out this common
functionality into a superclass. We can easily move the denitions of x and y into a
superclass, but what about on_click? Its denition depends on contains, which has
a dierent denition in each class. The solution is to create a virtual class. This class
will declare a contains method but leave its denition to the subclasses.

14.9 Create Some Simple Shapes
253
Here is the more succinct denition, starting with a virtual shape class that imple-
ments on_click and on_mousedown:
class virtual shape x y = object(self)
method virtual private contains: int -> int -> bool
val mutable x: int = x
method x = x
val mutable y: int = y
method y = y
method on_click ?start ?stop f =
on_click ?start ?stop
(fun ev ->
if self#contains ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y then
f ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y)
method on_mousedown ?start ?stop f =
on_mousedown ?start ?stop
(fun ev ->
if self#contains ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y then
f ev.mouse_x ev.mouse_y)
end
Now we can dene square and circle by inheriting from shape:
class square w x y = object
inherit shape x y
val mutable width = w
method width = width
method draw = fill_rect x y width width
method private contains x' y' =
x <= x' && x' <= x + width &&
y <= y' && y' <= y + width
end
class circle r x y = object
inherit shape x y
val mutable radius = r
method radius = radius
method draw = fill_circle x y radius
method private contains x' y' =
let dx = x' - x in
let dy = y' - y in
dx * dx + dy * dy <= radius * radius
end
One way to view a virtual class is that it is like a functor, where the inputs
are the declaredbut not denedvirtual methods and elds. The functor applica-

254
Classes
tion is implemented through inheritance, when virtual methods are given concrete
implementations.
14.10
Initializers
You can execute expressions during the instantiation of a class by placing them before
the object expression or in the initial value of a eld:
# class obj x =
let () = Stdio.printf "Creating obj %d\n" x in
object
val field = Stdio.printf "Initializing field\n"; x
end;;
class obj : int -> object val field : int end
# let o = new obj 3;;
Creating obj 3
Initializing field
val o : obj = <obj>
However, these expressions are executed before the object has been created and
cannot refer to the methods of the object. If you need to use an object's methods during
instantiation, you can use an initializer. An initializer is an expression that will be
executed during instantiation but after the object has been created.
For example, suppose we wanted to extend our previous shapes module with a
growing_circle class for circles that expand when clicked. We could inherit from
circle and use the inherited on_click to add a handler for click events:
class growing_circle r x y = object(self)
inherit circle r x y
initializer
self#on_click (fun _x _y -> radius <- radius * 2)
end
14.11
Multiple Inheritance
When a class inherits from more than one superclass, it is using multiple inheritance.
Multiple inheritance extends the variety of ways that classes can be combined, and it
can be quite useful, particularly with virtual classes. However, it can be tricky to use,
particularly when the inheritance hierarchy is a graph rather than a tree, so it should
be used with care.
14.11.1
How Names Are Resolved
The main trickiness of multiple inheritance is due to namingwhat happens when a
method or eld with some name is dened in more than one class?
If there is one thing to remember about inheritance in OCaml, it is this: inheritance is

14.11 Mixins
255
like textual inclusion. If there is more than one denition for a name, the last denition
wins.
For example, consider this class, which inherits from square and denes a new draw
method that uses draw_rect instead of fill_rect to draw the square:
class square_outline w x y = object
inherit square w x y
method draw = draw_rect x y width width
end
Since the inherit declaration comes before the method denition, the new draw
method overrides the old one, and the square is drawn using draw_rect. But, what if
we had dened square_outline as follows?
class square_outline w x y = object
method draw = draw_rect x y w w
inherit square w x y
end
Here the inherit declaration comes after the method denition, so the draw method
from square will override the other denition, and the square will be drawn using
fill_rect.
To reiterate, to understand what inheritance means, replace each inherit directive
with its denition, and take the last denition of each method or eld. Note that the
methods and elds added by an inheritance are those listed in its class type, so private
methods that are hidden by the type will not be included.
14.11.2
Mixins
When should you use multiple inheritance? If you ask multiple people, you're likely
to get multiple (perhaps heated) answers. Some will argue that multiple inheritance is
overly complicated; others will argue that inheritance is problematic in general, and
one should use object composition instead. But regardless of who you talk to, you will
rarely hear that multiple inheritance is great and that you should use it widely.
In any case, if you're programming with objects, there's one general pattern for
multiple inheritance that is both useful and reasonably simple: the mixin pattern.
Generically, a mixin is just a virtual class that implements a feature based on another
one. If you have a class that implements methods A, and you have a mixin M that
provides methods B from A, then you can inherit from Mmixing it into get
features B.
That's too abstract, so let's give some examples based on our interactive shapes. We
may wish to allow a shape to be dragged by the mouse. We can dene this functionality
for any object that has mutable x and y elds and an on_mousedown method for adding
event handlers:
class virtual draggable = object(self)
method virtual on_mousedown:
?start:unit Deferred.t ->
?stop:unit Deferred.t ->

256
Classes
(int -> int -> unit) -> unit
val virtual mutable x: int
val virtual mutable y: int
val mutable dragging = false
method dragging = dragging
initializer
self#on_mousedown
(fun mouse_x mouse_y ->
let offset_x = x - mouse_x in
let offset_y = y - mouse_y in
let mouse_up = Ivar.create () in
let stop = Ivar.read mouse_up in
dragging <- true;
on_mouseup ~stop
(fun _ ->
Ivar.fill mouse_up ();
dragging <- false);
on_mousemove ~stop
(fun ev ->
x <- ev.mouse_x + offset_x;
y <- ev.mouse_y + offset_y))
end
This allows us to create draggable shapes using multiple inheritance:
class small_square = object
inherit square 20 40 40
inherit draggable
end
We can also use mixins to create animated shapes. Each animated shape has a list
of update functions to be called during animation. We create an animated mixin to
provide this update list and ensure that the functions in it are called at regular intervals
when the shape is animated:
class virtual animated span = object(self)
method virtual on_click:
?start:unit Deferred.t ->
?stop:unit Deferred.t ->
(int -> int -> unit) -> unit
val mutable updates: (int -> unit) list = []
val mutable step = 0
val mutable running = false
method running = running
method animate =
step <- 0;
running <- true;
let stop =
Clock.after span
>>| fun () -> running <- false
in
Clock.every ~stop (Time.Span.of_sec (1.0 /. 24.0))
(fun () ->

14.11 Mixins
257
step <- step + 1;
List.iter ~f:(fun f -> f step) updates
)
initializer
self#on_click (fun _x _y -> if not self#running then self#animate)
end
We use initializers to add functions to this update list. For example, this class will
produce circles that move to the right for a second when clicked:
class my_circle = object
inherit circle 20 50 50
inherit animated Time.Span.second
initializer updates <- [fun _ -> x <- x + 5]
end
These initializers can also be added using mixins:
class virtual linear x' y' = object
val virtual mutable updates: (int -> unit) list
val virtual mutable x: int
val virtual mutable y: int
initializer
let update _ =
x <- x + x';
y <- y + y'
in
updates <- update :: updates
end
let pi = (Float.atan 1.0) *. 4.0
class virtual harmonic offset x' y' = object
val virtual mutable updates: (int -> unit) list
val virtual mutable x: int
val virtual mutable y: int
initializer
let update step =
let m = Float.sin (offset +. ((Float.of_int step) *. (pi /.
64.))) in
let x' = Float.to_int (m *. Float.of_int x') in
let y' = Float.to_int (m *. Float.of_int y') in
x <- x + x';
y <- y + y'
in
updates <- update :: updates
end
Since the linear and harmonic mixins are only used for their side eects, they can
be inherited multiple times within the same object to produce a variety of dierent
animations:
class my_square x y = object
inherit square 40 x y

258
Classes
inherit draggable
inherit animated (Time.Span.of_int_sec 5)
inherit linear 5 0
inherit harmonic 0.0 7 ~-10
end
let my_circle = object
inherit circle 30 250 250
inherit animated (Time.Span.minute)
inherit harmonic 0.0 10 0
inherit harmonic (pi /. 2.0) 0 10
end
14.11.3
Displaying the Animated Shapes
We nish our shapes module by creating a main function to draw some shapes on the
graphical display and running that function using the Async scheduler:
let main () =
let shapes = [
(my_circle :> drawable);
(new my_square 50 350 :> drawable);
(new my_square 50 200 :> drawable);
(new growing_circle 20 70 70 :> drawable);
] in
let repaint () =
clear_graph ();
List.iter ~f:(fun s -> s#draw) shapes;
synchronize ()
in
open_graph "";
auto_synchronize false;
Clock.every (Time.Span.of_sec (1.0 /. 24.0)) repaint
let () = never_returns (Scheduler.go_main ~main ())
Our main function creates a list of shapes to be displayed and denes a repaint
function that actually draws them on the display. We then open a graphical display and
ask Async to run repaint at regular intervals.
Finally, build the binary by linking against the async_graphics package, which will
pull in all the other dependencies:
(executable
(name
shapes)
(modules
shapes)
(libraries async_graphics))
$ dune build shapes.exe
When you run the binary, a new graphical window should appear (on macOS, you
will need to install the X11 package rst, which you will be prompted for). Try clicking
on the various widgets, and gasp in awe at the sophisticated animations that unfold as
a result.

14.11 Displaying the Animated Shapes
259
The graphics library described here is the one built into OCaml and is more useful
as a learning tool than anything else. There are several third-party libraries that provide
more sophisticated bindings to various graphics subsystems:
Lablgtk2 A strongly typed interface to the GTK widget library.
LablGL3 An interface between OCaml and OpenGL, a widely supported standard
for 3D rendering.
js_of_ocaml4 Compiles OCaml code to JavaScript and has bindings to WebGL. This
is the emerging standard for 3D rendering in web browsers.


Part II
Tools and Techniques
Part II builds on the basics by working through useful tools and techniques for ad-
dressing common practical applications, from command-line parsing to asynchronous
network programming. Along the way, you'll see how some of the concepts from Part I
are glued together into real libraries and tools that combine dierent features of the
language to good eect.


15
Maps and Hash Tables
Lots of programming problems require dealing with data organized as key/value pairs.
Maybe the simplest way of representing such data in OCaml is an association list,
which is simply a list of pairs of keys and values. For example, you could represent a
mapping between the 10 digits and their English names as follows:
# open Base;;
# let digit_alist =
[ 0, "zero"; 1, "one"; 2, "two"
; 3, "three"; 4, "four"
; 5, "five"; 6, "six"; 7, "seven"; 8, "eight"; 9, "nine" ];;
val digit_alist : (int * string) list =
[(0, "zero"); (1, "one"); (2, "two"); (3, "three"); (4, "four");
(5, "five"); (6, "six"); (7, "seven"); (8, "eight"); (9, "nine")]
We can use functions from the List.Assoc module to manipulate this data:
# List.Assoc.find ~equal:Int.equal digit_alist 6;;
- : string option = Some "six"
# List.Assoc.find ~equal:Int.equal digit_alist 22;;
- : string option = None
# List.Assoc.add ~equal:Int.equal digit_alist 0 "zilch";;
- : (int, string) Base.List.Assoc.t =
[(0, "zilch"); (1, "one"); (2, "two"); (3, "three"); (4, "four");
(5, "five"); (6, "six"); (7, "seven"); (8, "eight"); (9, "nine")]
Association lists are simple and easy to use, but their performance is not ideal, since
almost every nontrivial operation on an association list requires a linear-time scan of
the list.
In this chapter, we'll talk about two more ecient alternatives to association lists:
maps and hash tables. A map is an immutable tree-based data structure where most
operations take time logarithmic in the size of the map, whereas a hash table is a
mutable data structure where most operations have constant time complexity. We'll
describe both of these data structures in detail and provide some advice as to how to
choose between them.
15.1
Maps
Let's consider an example of how one might use a map in practice. In Chapter 5 (Files,
Modules, and Programs), we showed a module Counter for keeping frequency counts
on a set of strings. Here's the interface:

264
Maps and Hash Tables
open Base
(** A collection of string frequency counts *)
type t
(** The empty set of frequency counts *)
val empty : t
(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)
val touch : t -> string -> t
(** Converts the set of frequency counts to an association list. Every
string in the list will show up at most once, and the integers
will be at least 1. *)
val to_list : t -> (string * int) list
The intended behavior here is straightforward. Counter.empty represents an empty
collection of frequency counts; touch increments the frequency count of the specied
string by 1; and to_list returns the list of nonzero frequencies.
Here's the implementation.
open Base
type t = (string, int, String.comparator_witness) Map.t
let empty = Map.empty (module String)
let to_list t = Map.to_alist t
let touch t s =
let count =
match Map.find t s with
| None -> 0
| Some x -> x
in
Map.set t ~key:s ~data:(count + 1)
Take a look at the denition of the type t above. You'll see that the Map.t has three
type parameters. The rst two are what you might expect; one for the type of the key,
and one for the type of the data. The third type parameter, the comparator witness,
requires some explaining.
The comparator witness is used to indicate which comparison function was used to
construct the map, rather than saying something about the type of data stored in the
map. The type String.comparator_witness in particular indicates that this map was
built with the default comparison function from the String module. We'll talk about
why the comparator witness is important later in the chapter.
The call to Map.empty is also worth explaining, in that, unusually, it takes a rst-class
module as an argument. The point of the rst class module is to provide the comparison
function that is required for building the map, along with an s-expression converter for
generating useful error messages (we'll talk more about s-expressions in Chapter 21
(Data Serialization with S-Expressions)). We don't need to provide the module again
for functions like Map.find or Map.add, because the map itself contains a reference to
the comparison function it uses.

15.1 Modules and Comparators
265
Not every module can be used for creating maps, but the standard ones in Base can.
Later in the chapter, we'll show how you can set up a module of your own so it can be
used in this way.
15.1.1
Sets
In addition to maps, Base also provides a set data type that's designed along similar
lines. In some sense, sets are little more than maps where you ignore the data. But
while you could encode sets in terms of maps, it's more natural, and more ecient, to
use Base's specialized set type. Here's a simple example.
# Set.of_list (module Int) [1;2;3] |> Set.to_list;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# Set.union
(Set.of_list (module Int) [1;2;3;2])
(Set.of_list (module Int) [3;5;1])
|> Set.to_list;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 5]
In addition to the operators you would expect to have for maps, sets support the
traditional set operations, including union, intersection, and set dierence.
15.1.2
Modules and Comparators
It's easy enough to create a map or set based on a type represented by a module in Base.
Here, we'll create a map from digits to their English names, based on digit_alist,
which was dened earlier in the chapter.
# let digit_map = Map.of_alist_exn (module Int) digit_alist;;
val digit_map : (int, string, Int.comparator_witness) Map.t = <abstr>
# Map.find digit_map 3;;
- : string option = Some "three"
The function Map.of_alist_exn constructs a map from a provided association list,
throwing an exception if a key is used more than once. Let's take a look at the type
signature of Map.of_alist_exn.
# #show Map.of_alist_exn;;
val of_alist_exn :
('a, 'cmp) Map.comparator -> ('a * 'b) list -> ('a, 'b, 'cmp) Map.t
The type Map.comparator is actually an alias for a rst-class module type, repre-
senting any module that matches the signature Comparator.S, shown below.
# #show Base.Comparator.S;;
module type S =
sig
type t
type comparator_witness
val comparator : (t, comparator_witness) Comparator.t
end

266
Maps and Hash Tables
Such a module must contain the type of the key itself, as well as the
comparator_witness type, which serves as a type-level identier of the comparison
function in question, and nally, the concrete comparator itself, a value that contains
the necessary comparison function.
Modules from Base like Int and String already satisfy this interface. But what
if you want to satisfy this interface with a new module? Consider, for example, the
following type representing a book, for which we've written a comparison function
and an s-expression serializer.
# module Book = struct
type t = { title: string; isbn: string }
let compare t1 t2 =
let cmp_title = String.compare t1.title t2.title in
if cmp_title <> 0 then cmp_title
else String.compare t1.isbn t2.isbn
let sexp_of_t t : Sexp.t =
List [ Atom t.title; Atom t.isbn ]
end;;
module Book :
sig
type t = { title : string; isbn : string; }
val compare : t -> t -> int
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
end
This module has the basic functionality we need, but doesn't satisfy the
Comparator.S interface, so we can't use it for creating a map, as you can see.
# Map.empty (module Book);;
Line 1, characters 19-23:
Error: Signature mismatch:

File "duniverse/base/src/comparator.mli", line 21, characters
2-53:
Expected declaration
In order to satisfy the interface, we need to use the Comparator.Make functor to
extend the module. Here, we use a common idiom where we create a submodule,
called T containing the basic functionality for the type in question, and then include
both that module and the result of applying a functor to that module.
module Book = struct
module T = struct
type t = { title: string; isbn: string }
let compare t1 t2 =

15.1 Why Do We Need Comparator Witnesses?
267
let cmp_title = String.compare t1.title t2.title in
if cmp_title <> 0 then cmp_title
else String.compare t1.isbn t2.isbn
let sexp_of_t t : Sexp.t =
List [ Atom t.title; Atom t.isbn ]
end
include T
include Comparator.Make(T)
end;;
With this module in hand, we can now build a set of Book.t's.
# let some_programming_books =
Set.of_list (module Book)
[ { title = "Real World OCaml"
; isbn = "978-1449323912" }
; { title = "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
; isbn = "978-0262510875" }
; { title = "The C Programming Language"
; isbn = "978-0131101630" } ];;
val some_programming_books : (Book.t, Book.comparator_witness) Set.t =
<abstr>
While we used Comparator.Make in the above, it's often preferable to use
Comparable.Make instead, since it provides extra helper functions, like inx com-
parison operators and min and max functions, in addition to the comparator itself.
15.1.3
Why Do We Need Comparator Witnesses?
The comparator witness is quite dierent from other types that we've seen. Instead
of tracking the kind of data being used, it's used to single out a particular value, a
comparison function. Why do we even need such a thing?
The comparator witness matters because some of the operations on maps and
sets, in particular those that combine multiple maps or sets together, depend for their
correctness on the fact that both objects being combined are ordered according to the
same total order, which in turn is determined by the comparison function.
Consider, for example, Map.symmetric_diff, which computes the dierence be-
tween two maps.
# let left = Map.of_alist_exn (module String) ["foo",1; "bar",3;
"snoo",0];;
val left : (string, int, String.comparator_witness) Map.t = <abstr>
# let right = Map.of_alist_exn (module String) ["foo",0; "snoo",0];;
val right : (string, int, String.comparator_witness) Map.t = <abstr>
# Map.symmetric_diff ~data_equal:Int.equal left right |>
Sequence.to_list;;
- : (string, int) Map.Symmetric_diff_element.t list =
[("bar", `Left 3); ("foo", `Unequal (1, 0))]
As you can see below, the type of Map.symmetric_diff requires that the two maps

268
Maps and Hash Tables
it compares have the same comparator witness, in addition to the same key and value
type.
# #show Map.symmetric_diff;;
val symmetric_diff :
('k, 'v, 'cmp) Map.t ->
('k, 'v, 'cmp) Map.t ->
data_equal:('v -> 'v -> bool) ->
('k, 'v) Map.Symmetric_diff_element.t Sequence.t
Without this constraint, we could run Map.symmetric_diff on maps that are sorted
in dierent orders, which could lead to garbled results.
To see this constraint in action, we'll need to create two maps with the same key
and data types, but dierent comparison functions. In the following, we do this by
minting a new module Reverse, which represents strings sorted in the reverse of the
usual lexicographic order.
module Reverse = struct
module T = struct
type t = string
let sexp_of_t = String.sexp_of_t
let t_of_sexp = String.t_of_sexp
let compare x y = String.compare y x
end
include T
include Comparator.Make(T)
end;;
As you can see in the following, both Reverse and String can be used to create
maps with a key type of string:
# let alist = ["foo", 0; "snoo", 3];;
val alist : (string * int) list = [("foo", 0); ("snoo", 3)]
# let ord_map = Map.of_alist_exn (module String) alist;;
val ord_map : (string, int, String.comparator_witness) Map.t = <abstr>
# let rev_map = Map.of_alist_exn (module Reverse) alist;;
val rev_map : (string, int, Reverse.comparator_witness) Map.t =
<abstr>
Map.min_elt returns the key and value for the smallest key in the map, which
conrms that these two maps do indeed use dierent comparison functions.
# Map.min_elt ord_map;;
- : (string * int) option = Some ("foo", 0)
# Map.min_elt rev_map;;
- : (string * int) option = Some ("snoo", 3)
As a result, the algorithm in Map.symmetric_diff just wouldn't work correctly when
applied to these values. Happily, the type system will give us a compile-time error if
we try, instead of throwing an error at run time, or worse, silently returning the wrong
result.
# Map.symmetric_diff ord_map rev_map;;

15.1.4
The Polymorphic Comparator
We don't need to generate specialized comparators for every type we want to build a map
on. We can instead build a map based on OCaml's built-in polymorphic comparison
function, which was discussed in Chapter 4 (Lists and Patterns).
# Map.Poly.of_alist_exn digit_alist;;
- : (int, string) Map.Poly.t = <abstr>
Note that maps based on the polymorphic comparator have dierent comparator wit-
nesses than those based on the type-specic comparison function. Thus, the compiler
rejects the following:
# Map.symmetric_diff
(Map.Poly.singleton 3 "three")
(Map.singleton (module Int) 3 "four" );;
Line 3, characters 5-43:
Error: This expression has type (int, string, Int.comparator_witness)
Map.t
but an expression was expected of type
(int, string, Comparator.Poly.comparator_witness) Map.t
Type Int.comparator_witness is not compatible with type
Comparator.Poly.comparator_witness
This is rejected for good reason: there's no guarantee that the comparator associated
with a given type will order things in the same way that polymorphic compare does.
The Perils of Polymorphic Compare
Polymorphic compare is awfully convenient, but it has serious downsides and should
mostly be avoided in production code. To understand why, it helps to understand how
polymorphic compare works.
Polymorphic compare operates directly on the runtime representation of OCaml
values, walking the structure of those values without regard for their type.
And despite ignoring types, it mostly behaves as you would hope. Comparisons on
ints and floats respect the ordinary ordering of numeric values, and containers like
strings, lists, and arrays are compared lexicographically. And it works on almost every
OCaml type, with some important exceptions like functions.
But the type-oblivious nature of polymorphic compare means that it peeks under
ordinary abstraction boundaries, and that can lead to some deeply confusing results.
Maps themselves provide a great example of this. Consider the following two maps.
# let m1 = Map.of_alist_exn (module Int) [1, "one";2, "two"];;
val m1 : (int, string, Int.comparator_witness) Map.t = <abstr>
# let m2 = Map.of_alist_exn (module Int) [2, "two";1, "one"];;
val m2 : (int, string, Int.comparator_witness) Map.t = <abstr>

270
Maps and Hash Tables
Logically, these two maps should be equal, and that's the result that you get if you
call Map.equal on them:
# Map.equal String.equal m1 m2;;
- : bool = true
But because the elements were added in dierent orders, the layout of the trees
underlying the maps will be dierent. As such, polymorphic compare will conclude
that they're dierent.
We can see this below. Note that Base hides polymorphic comparison by default,
but it is available within the Poly module.
# Poly.(m1 = m2);;
Exception: (Invalid_argument "compare: functional value")
This comparison failed because polymorphic compare doesn't work on functions,
and maps store the comparison function they were created with. Happily, there's a
function, Map.Using_comparator.to_tree which exposes the underlying binary tree
without the attached comparison function. We can use that to compare the underlying
trees:
# Poly.((Map.Using_comparator.to_tree m1) =
(Map.Using_comparator.to_tree m2));;
- : bool = false
As you can see, polymorphic compare now produces a result, but it's not the result we
want.
The abstraction-breaking nature of polymorphic compare can cause real and quite
subtle bugs. If, for example, you build a map whose keys are sets (which have the
same issues with polymorphic compare that maps do), then the map built with the
polymorphic comparator will behave incorrectly, separating out keys that should be
aggregated together. Even worse, it will behave inconsistently, since the behavior of
polymorphic compare will depend on the order in which the sets were built.
15.1.5
Satisfying Comparator.S with [@@deriving]
Using maps and sets on a new type requires satisfying the Comparator.S interface,
which in turn requires s-expression converters and comparison functions for the type
in question. Writing such functions by hand is annoying and error prone, but there's a
better way. Base comes along with a set of syntax extensions that automate these tasks
away.
Let's return to an example from earlier in the chapter, where we created a type
Book.t and set it up for use in creating maps and sets.
module Book = struct
module T = struct
type t = { title: string; isbn: string }
let compare t1 t2 =

15.1 Satisfying Comparator.S with [@@deriving]
271
let cmp_title = String.compare t1.title t2.title in
if cmp_title <> 0 then cmp_title
else String.compare t1.isbn t2.isbn
let sexp_of_t t : Sexp.t =
List [ Atom t.title; Atom t.isbn ]
end
include T
include Comparator.Make(T)
end
Much of the code here is devoted to creating a comparison function and s-expression
converter for the type Book.t. But if we have the ppx_sexp_conv and ppx_compare
syntax extensions enabled, then we can request that default implementations of these
functions be created for us. We can enable both of these extensions via the omnibus
ppx_jane package.
# #require "ppx_jane";;
And we can use the extensions in our denition of Book as follows:
module Book = struct
module T = struct
type t = { title: string; isbn: string }
[@@deriving compare, sexp_of]
end
include T
include Comparator.Make(T)
end;;
If you want a comparison function that orders things in a particular way, you can
always write your own by hand; but if all you need is a total order suitable for creating
maps and sets with, then [@@deriving compare] is a good choice.
=, ==, and phys_equal
OCaml has multiple notions of equality, and picking the right one can be tricky. If you
don't open Base, you'll nd that the == operator tests for physical equality, while the =
operator is the polymorphic equality function.
Two values are considered physically equal if they are the same pointer in memory.
Two data structures that have identical contents but are constructed separately will not
be considered equal by ==. Polymorphic equality, on the other hand, is structural, which
eectively means that it considers values to be equal if they have the same contents.
Most of the time you don't want either of these forms of equality! Polymorphic
equality is problematic for reasons we explained earlier in the chapter, and physical
equality, while useful, is something that's needed in particular cases, most often when
you're dealing with mutable objects, where the physical identity of the object matters.
Base hides polymorphic equality, instead reserving = for equality functions associ-
ated with particular types. At the top-level = is specialized to integers.
# 1 = 2;;
- : bool = false

272
Maps and Hash Tables
# "one" = "two";;
Line 1, characters 1-6:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
int
Other type-specic equality functions are found in their associated modules
# String.("one" = "two");;
- : bool = false
It's quite easy to mix up = and ==, and so Base deprecates == and provides phys_equal
instead, a function with a clear and descriptive name.
# ref 1 == ref 1;;
Line 1, characters 7-9:
Alert deprecated: Base.==
[2016-09] this element comes from the stdlib distributed with OCaml.
Use [phys_equal] instead.
- : bool = false
# phys_equal (ref 1) (ref 1);;
- : bool = false
This is just a small way in which Base tries to avoid error-prone APIs.
15.1.6
Applying [@@deriving] to Maps and Sets
In the previous section, we showed how to use [@@deriving] annotations to set up
a type so it could be used to create a map or set type. But what if we want to put a
[@@deriving] annotation on a map or set type itself?
# type string_int_map =
(string,int,String.comparator_witness) Map.t [@@deriving sexp];;
Line 2, characters 44-49:
Error: Unbound value Map.t_of_sexp
Hint: Did you mean m__t_of_sexp?
This fails because there is no existing Map.t_of_sexp. This isn't a simple omission;
there's no reasonable way to dene a useful Map.t_of_sexp, because a comparator
witness isn't something that can be parsed out of the s-expression.
Happily, there's another way of writing the type of a map that does work with the
various [@@deriving] extensions, which you can see below.
# type string_int_map = int Map.M(String).t [@@deriving sexp];;
type string_int_map = int Base.Map.M(Base.String).t
val string_int_map_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> string_int_map = <fun>
val sexp_of_string_int_map : string_int_map -> Sexp.t = <fun>
Here, we use a functor, Map.M, to dene the type we need. While this looks dierent
than the ordinary type signature, the meaning of the type is the same, as we can see
below.
# let m = Map.singleton (module String) "one" 1;;
val m : (string, int, String.comparator_witness) Map.t = <abstr>

15.2 Hash Tables
273
# (m : int Map.M(String).t);;
- : int Base.Map.M(Base.String).t = <abstr>
This same type works with other derivers as well, like those for comparison and
hash functions. Since this way of writing the type is also shorter, it's what you should
use most of the time.
15.1.7
Trees
As we've discussed, maps carry within them the comparator that they were created
with. Sometimes, for space eciency reasons, you want a version of the map data
structure that doesn't include the comparator. You can get such a representation with
Map.Using_comparator.to_tree, which returns just the tree underlying the map, with-
out the comparator.
# let ord_tree = Map.Using_comparator.to_tree ord_map;;
val ord_tree :
(string, int, String.comparator_witness)
Map.Using_comparator.Tree.t =
<abstr>
Even though the tree doesn't physically include a comparator, it does include the
comparator in its type. This is what is known as a phantom type, because it reects
something about the logic of the value in question, even though it doesn't correspond
to any values directly represented in the underlying physical structure of the value.
Since the comparator isn't included in the tree, we need to provide the comparator
explicitly when we, say, search for a key, as shown below:
# Map.Using_comparator.Tree.find ~comparator:String.comparator
ord_tree "snoo";;
- : int option = Some 3
The algorithm of Map.Tree.find depends on the fact that it's using the same com-
parator when looking up a value as you were when you stored it. That's the invariant
that the phantom type is there to enforce. As you can see in the following example,
using the wrong comparator will lead to a type error:
# Map.Using_comparator.Tree.find ~comparator:Reverse.comparator
ord_tree "snoo";;
Line 1, characters 63-71:
Error: This expression has type
(string, int, String.comparator_witness)
Map.Using_comparator.Tree.t
but an expression was expected of type
(string, int, Reverse.comparator_witness)
Map.Using_comparator.Tree.t
Type String.comparator_witness is not compatible with type
Reverse.comparator_witness

274
Maps and Hash Tables
15.2
Hash Tables
Hash tables are the imperative cousin of maps. We walked through a basic hash table
implementation in Chapter 9 (Imperative Programming), so in this section we'll mostly
discuss the pragmatics of Core's Hashtbl module. We'll cover this material more briey
than we did with maps because many of the concepts are shared.
Hash tables dier from maps in a few key ways. First, hash tables are mutable,
meaning that adding a key/value pair to a hash table modies the table, rather than
creating a new table with the binding added. Second, hash tables generally have
better time-complexity than maps, providing constant-time lookup and modications,
as opposed to logarithmic for maps. And nally, just as maps depend on having a
comparison function for creating the ordered binary tree that underlies a map, hash
tables depend on having a hash function, i.e., a function for converting a key to an
integer.
15.2.1
Time Complexity of Hash Tables
The statement that hash tables provide constant-time access hides some complexities.
First of all, most hash table implementations, OCaml's included, need to resize the
table when it gets too full. A resize requires allocating a new backing array for the
hash table and copying over all entries, and so it is quite an expensive operation. That
means adding a new element to the table is only amortized constant, which is to say,
it's constant on average over a long sequence of operations, but some of the individual
operations can cost more.
Another hidden cost of hash tables has to do with the hash function you use. If you
end up with a pathologically bad hash function that hashes all of your data to the same
number, then all of your insertions will hash to the same underlying bucket, meaning
you no longer get constant-time access at all. Base's hash table implementation uses
binary trees for the hash-buckets, so this case only leads to logarithmic time, rather
than linear for a traditional implementation.
The logarithmic behavior of Base's hash tables in the presence of hash collisions also
helps protect against some denial-of-service attacks. One well-known type of attack is
to send queries to a service with carefully chosen keys to cause many collisions. This,
in combination with the linear behavior of most hashtables, can cause the service to
become unresponsive due to high CPU load. Base's hash tables would be much less
susceptible to such an attack because the amount of degradation would be far less.
We create a hashtable in a way that's similar to how we create maps, by providing a
rst-class module from which the required operations for building a hashtable can be
obtained.
# let table = Hashtbl.create (module String);;
val table : (string, '_weak1) Base.Hashtbl.t = <abstr>
# Hashtbl.set table ~key:"three" ~data:3;;
- : unit = ()
# Hashtbl.find table "three";;

15.2 Hash Tables
275
- : int option = Some 3
As with maps, most modules in Base are ready to be used for this purpose, but if
you want to create a hash table from one of your own types, you need to do some work
to prepare it. In order for a module to be suitable for passing to Hashtbl.create, it has
to match the following interface.
# #show Base.Hashtbl.Key.S;;
module type S =
sig
type t
val compare : t -> t -> int
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
val hash : t -> int
end
Note that there's no equivalent to the comparator witness that came up for maps
and sets. That's because the requirement for multiple objects to share a comparison
function or a hash function mostly just doesn't come up for hash tables. That makes
building a module suitable for use with a hash table simpler.
# module Book = struct
type t = { title: string; isbn: string }
[@@deriving compare, sexp_of, hash]
end;;
module Book :
sig
type t = { title : string; isbn : string; }
val compare : t -> t -> int
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t
val hash_fold_t :
Base_internalhash_types.state -> t ->
Base_internalhash_types.state
val hash : t -> int
end
# let table = Hashtbl.create (module Book);;
val table : (Book.t, '_weak2) Base.Hashtbl.t = <abstr>
You can also create a hashtable based on OCaml's polymorphic hash and comparison
functions.
# let table = Hashtbl.Poly.create ();;
val table : ('_weak3, '_weak4) Base.Hashtbl.t = <abstr>
# Hashtbl.set table ~key:("foo",3,[1;2;3]) ~data:"random data!";;
- : unit = ()
# Hashtbl.find table ("foo",3,[1;2;3]);;
- : string option = Some "random data!"
This is highly convenient, but polymorphic comparison can behave in surprising
ways, so it's generally best to avoid this for code where correctness matters.
15.2.2
Collisions with the Polymorphic Hash Function
The polymorphic hash function, like polymorphic compare, has problems that derive
from the fact that it doesn't pay any attention to the type, just blindly walking down

276
Maps and Hash Tables
the structure of a data type and computing a hash from what it sees. That means that
for data structures like maps and sets where equivalent instances can have dierent
structures, it will do the wrong thing.
But there's another problem with polymorphic hash, which is that it is prone to
creating hash collisions. OCaml's polymorphic hash function works by walking over
the data structure it's given using a breadth-rst traversal that is bounded in the number
of nodes it's willing to traverse. By default, that bound is set at 10 meaningful nodes.
The bound on the traversal means that the hash function may ignore part of the
data structure, and this can lead to pathological cases where every value you store has
the same hash value. We'll demonstrate this below, using the function List.range to
allocate lists of integers of dierent length:
# Hashtbl.Poly.hashable.hash (List.range 0 9);;
- : int = 209331808
# Hashtbl.Poly.hashable.hash (List.range 0 10);;
- : int = 182325193
# Hashtbl.Poly.hashable.hash (List.range 0 11);;
- : int = 182325193
# Hashtbl.Poly.hashable.hash (List.range 0 100);;
- : int = 182325193
As you can see, the hash function stops after the rst 10 elements. The same can
happen with any large data structure, including records and arrays. When building hash
functions over large custom data structures, it is generally a good idea to write one's
own hash function, or to use the ones provided by [@@deriving], which don't have this
problem, as you can see below.
# [%hash: int list] (List.range 0 9);;
- : int = 999007935
# [%hash: int list] (List.range 0 10);;
- : int = 195154657
# [%hash: int list] (List.range 0 11);;
- : int = 527899773
# [%hash: int list] (List.range 0 100);;
- : int = 594983280
Note that rather than declaring a type and using [@@deriving hash] to invoke
ppx_hash, we use [%hash], a shorthand for creating a hash function inline in an
expression.
15.3
Choosing Between Maps and Hash Tables
Maps and hash tables overlap enough in functionality that it's not always clear when to
choose one or the other. Maps, by virtue of being immutable, are generally the default
choice in OCaml. OCaml also has good support for imperative programming, though,
and when programming in an imperative idiom, hash tables are often the more natural
choice.

15.3 Choosing Between Maps and Hash Tables
277
Programming idioms aside, there are signicant performance dierences between
maps and hash tables. For code that is dominated by updates and lookups, hash tables
are a clear performance win, and the win is clearer the larger the amount of data.
The best way of answering a performance question is by running a benchmark,
so let's do just that. The following benchmark uses the core_bench library, and it
compares maps and hash tables under a very simple workload. Here, we're keeping
track of a set of 1,000 dierent integer keys and cycling over the keys and updating the
values they contain. Note that we use the Map.change and Hashtbl.change functions
to update the respective data structures:
open Base
open Core_bench
let map_iter ~num_keys ~iterations =
let rec loop i map =
if i <= 0
then ()
else
loop
(i - 1)
(Map.change map (i % num_keys) ~f:(fun current ->
Some (1 + Option.value ~default:0 current)))
in
loop iterations (Map.empty (module Int))
let table_iter ~num_keys ~iterations =
let table = Hashtbl.create (module Int) ~size:num_keys in
let rec loop i =
if i <= 0
then ()
else (
Hashtbl.change table (i % num_keys) ~f:(fun current ->
Some (1 + Option.value ~default:0 current));
loop (i - 1))
in
loop iterations
let tests ~num_keys ~iterations =
let t name f = Bench.Test.create f ~name in
[ t "table" (fun () -> table_iter ~num_keys ~iterations)
; t "map" (fun () -> map_iter ~num_keys ~iterations)
]
let () =
tests ~num_keys:1000 ~iterations:100_000
|> Bench.make_command
|> Core.Command.run
The results show the hash table version to be around four times faster than the map
version:

We can make the speedup smaller or larger depending on the details of the test; for
example, it will vary with the number of distinct keys. But overall, for code that is
heavy on sequences of querying and updating a set of key/value pairs, hash tables will
signicantly outperform maps.
Hash tables are not always the faster choice, though. In particular, maps excel in
situations where you need to keep multiple related versions of the data structure in
memory at once. That's because maps are immutable, and so operations like Map.add
that modify a map do so by creating a new map, leaving the original undisturbed.
Moreover, the new and old maps share most of their physical structure, so keeping
multiple versions around can be space-ecient.
Here's a benchmark that demonstrates this. In it, we create a list of maps (or hash
tables) that are built up by iteratively applying small updates, keeping these copies
around. In the map case, this is done by using Map.change to update the map. In the
hash table implementation, the updates are done using Hashtbl.change, but we also
need to call Hashtbl.copy to take snapshots of the table:
open Base
open Core_bench
let create_maps ~num_keys ~iterations =
let rec loop i map =
if i <= 0
then []
else (
let new_map =
Map.change map (i % num_keys) ~f:(fun current ->
Some (1 + Option.value ~default:0 current))
in
new_map :: loop (i - 1) new_map)
in
loop iterations (Map.empty (module Int))
let create_tables ~num_keys ~iterations =
let table = Hashtbl.create (module Int) ~size:num_keys in
let rec loop i =
if i <= 0
then []
else (
Hashtbl.change table (i % num_keys) ~f:(fun current ->
Some (1 + Option.value ~default:0 current));
let new_table = Hashtbl.copy table in
new_table :: loop (i - 1))

]
let () =

Unsurprisingly, maps perform far better than hash tables on this benchmark, in this
case by more than a factor of 10:

These numbers can be made more extreme by increasing the size of the tables or
the length of the list.
As you can see, the relative performance of trees and maps depends a great deal
on the details of how they're used, and so whether to choose one data structure or the
other will depend on the details of the application.

Command-Line Parsing
Many of the OCaml programs that you'll write will end up as binaries that need to be
run from a command prompt. Any nontrivial command line should support a collection
of basic features:
• Parsing of command-line arguments
• Generation of error messages in response to incorrect inputs
• Help for all the available options
• Interactive autocompletion
It's tedious and error-prone to code all of this manually for every program you write.
Core provides the Command library, which simplies all of this by letting you declare
your command-line options in one place and by deriving all of the above functionality
from these declarations.
Command is simple to use for simple applications but also scales well as your needs
grow more complex. In particular, Command provides a sophisticated subcommand
mode that groups related commands together as the complexity of your user interface
grows. You may already be familiar with this command-line style from the Git or
Mercurial version control systems.
In this chapter, we'll:
• Learn how to use Command to construct basic and grouped command-line interfaces
• Build simple equivalents to the cryptographic md5 and shasum utilities
• Demonstrate how to declare complex command-line interfaces in a type-safe and
elegant way
16.1
Basic Command-Line Parsing
Let's start by working through a clone of the md5sum command that is present on most
Linux installations (the equivalent command on macOS is simply md5). The following
function dened below reads in the contents of a le, applies the MD5 one-way
cryptographic hash function to the data, and outputs an ASCII hex representation of
the result:
open Core

16.1 Dening Basic Commands
281
let do_hash file =
Md5.digest_file_blocking file |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline
The do_hash function accepts a filename parameter and prints the human-readable
MD5 string to the console standard output. The rst step toward turning this function
into a command-line program is to create a parser for the command line arguments. The
module Command.Param provides a set of combinators that can be combined together
to dene a parameter parser for optional ags and positional arguments, including
documentation, the types they should map to, and whether to take special actions such
as pausing for interactive input if certain inputs are encountered.
16.1.1
Dening an Anonymous Argument
Let's build a parser for a command line UI with a single anonymous argument, i.e., an
argument that is passed in without a ag.
let filename_param =
let open Command.Param in
anon ("filename" %: string)
Here, anon is used to signal the parsing of an anonymous argument, and the ex-
pression ("filename" %: string) indicates the textual name of the argument and
specication that describes the kind of value that is expected. The textual name is used
for generating help text, and the specication, which has type Command.Arg_type.t, is
used both to nail down the OCaml type of the returned value (string, in this case) and
to guide features like input validation. The values anon, string and %: all come from
the Command.Param module.
16.1.2
Dening Basic Commands
Once we've dened a specication, we need to put it to work on real input. The simplest
way is to directly create a command-line interface with Command.basic.
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(Command.Param.map filename_param ~f:(fun filename () ->
do_hash filename))
The summary argument is a one-line description which goes at the top of the help
screen, while the (optional) readme argument is for providing a more detailed descrip-
tion that will be provided on demand.
The nal argument is the most interesting one, which is the parameter parser. This
will be easier to understand if we rst learn a bit more about the type signatures of the
various components we've been using. Let's do that by recreating some of this code in
the toplevel.
# let filename_param = Command.Param.(anon ("filename" %: string));;
val filename_param : string Command.Spec.param = <abstr>

Command-Line Parsing
The type parameter of filename_param is there to indicate the type of the value returned
by the parser; in this case, string.
But Command.basic requires a parameter parser that returns a value of type unit
-> unit. We can see that by using #show to explore the types.
# #show Command.basic;;
val basic : unit Command.basic_command
# #show Command.basic_command;;
type nonrec 'result basic_command =
summary:string ->
?readme:(unit -> string) ->
(unit -> 'result) Command.Spec.param -> Command.t
Note that the 'result parameter of the type alias basic_command is instantiated as
unit for the type of Command.basic.
It makes sense that Command.basic wants a parser that returns a function; after all,
in the end, it needs a function it can run that constitutes the execution of the program.
But how do we get such a parser, given the parser we have returns just a lename?
The answer is to use a map function to change the value returned by the parser.
As you can see below, the type of Command.Param.map is very similar to the type of
List.map.
# #show Command.Param.map;;
val map : 'a Command.Spec.param -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'b Command.Spec.param
In our program, we used map to convert the filename_param parser, which returns a
string representing the le name, into a parser that returns a function of type unit ->
unit containing the body of the command. It might not be obvious that the function
passed to map returns a function, but remember that, due to currying, the invocation
of map above could be written equivalently as follows.
Command.Param.map filename_param ~f:(fun filename ->
fun () -> do_hash filename)
16.1.3
Running Commands
Once we've dened the basic command, running it is just one function call away.
let () = Command.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
Command.run takes a couple of optional arguments that are useful to identify which
version of the binary you are running in production. You'll need the following dune
le:
(executable
(name
md5)
(libraries
core)
(preprocess (pps ppx_jane)))
At which point we can build and execute the program using dune exec. Let's use
this to query version information from the binary.

16.1 Multi-Argument Commands
283
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -version
1.0
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -build-info
RWO
The versions that you see in the output were dened via the optional arguments
to Command.run. You can leave these blank in your own programs or get your build
system to generate them directly from your version control system. Dune provides a
dune-build-info library1 that automates this process for most common workows.
We can invoke our binary with -help to see the auto-generated help.
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -help
Generate an MD5 hash of the input data
md5.exe FILENAME
More detailed information
=== flags ===
[-build-info]
print info about this build and exit
[-version]
print the version of this build and exit
[-help]
print this help text and exit
(alias: -?)
If you supply the filename argument, then do_hash is called with the argument and
the MD5 output is displayed to the standard output.
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe md5.ml
2ae55d17ff11d337492a1ca5510ee01b
And that's all it takes to build our little MD5 utility! Here's a complete version
of the example we just walked through, made slightly more succinct by removing
intermediate variables.
open Core
let do_hash file =
Md5.digest_file_blocking file |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
Command.Param.(
map
(anon ("filename" %: string))
~f:(fun filename () -> do_hash filename))
let () = Command.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command

284
Command-Line Parsing
16.1.4
Multi-Argument Commands
All the examples thus far have involved a single argument, but we can of course create
multi-argument commands as well. We can make a parser for multiple arguments by
binding together simpler parsers, using the function Command.Param.both. Here is its
type.
# #show Command.Param.both;;
val both :
'a Command.Spec.param ->
'b Command.Spec.param -> ('a * 'b) Command.Spec.param
both allows us to take two parameter parsers and combine them into a single parser
that returns the two arguments as a pair. In the following, we rewrite our md5 program
so it takes two anonymous arguments: the rst is an integer saying how many characters
of the hash to print out, and the second is the lename.
open Core
let do_hash hash_length filename =
Md5.digest_file_blocking filename
|> Md5.to_hex
|> (fun s -> String.prefix s hash_length)
|> print_endline
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
Command.Param.(
map
(both
(anon ("hash_length" %: int))
(anon ("filename" %: string)))
~f:(fun (hash_length, filename) () ->
do_hash hash_length filename))
let () = Command.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
Building and running this command, we can see that it now indeed expects two
arguments.
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe 5 md5.ml
f8824
This works well enough for two parameters, but if you want longer parameter lists,
this approach gets old fast. A better way is to use let-syntax, which was discussed in
Chapter 8.1.3 (bind and Other Error Handling Idioms).
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let open Command.Let_syntax in
let open Command.Param in
let%map hash_length = anon ("hash_length" %: int)

16.2 Dening Custom Argument Types
285
and filename = anon ("filename" %: string) in
fun () -> do_hash hash_length filename)
Here, we take advantage of let-syntax's support for parallel let bindings, using and
to join the denitions together. This syntax translates down to the same pattern based
on both that we showed above, but it's easier to read and use, and scales better to more
arguments.
The need to open both modules is a little awkward, and the Param module in par-
ticular you really only need on the right-hand-side of the equals-sign. This is achieved
automatically by using the let%map_open syntax, demonstrated below. We'll also drop
the open of Command.Let_syntax in favor of explicitly using let%map_open.Command
to mark the let-syntax as coming from the Command module
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let%map_open.Command hash_length = anon ("hash_length" %: int)
and filename = anon ("filename" %: string) in
fun () -> do_hash hash_length filename)
Let-syntax is the most common way of writing parsers for Command, and we'll use
that idiom from here on.
Now that we have the basics in place, the rest of the chapter will examine some of
the more advanced features of Command.
16.2
Argument Types
You aren't just limited to parsing command lines of strings and ints. There are some
other argument types dened in Command.Param, like date and percent. But most of
the time, argument types for specic types in Core and other associated libraries are
dened in the module that denes the type in question.
As an example, we can tighten up the specication of the command to
Filename.arg_type to reect that the argument must be a valid lename, and not
just any string.
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let%map_open.Command file =
anon ("filename" %: Filename.arg_type)
in
fun () -> do_hash file)
Thisdoesn'tchangethevalidationoftheprovidedvalue,butitdoesenableinteractive
command-line completion. We'll explain how to enable that later in the chapter.

286
Command-Line Parsing
16.2.1
Dening Custom Argument Types
We can also dene our own argument types if the predened ones aren't sucient. For
instance, let's make a regular_file argument type that ensures that the input le isn't
a character device or some other odd UNIX le type that can't be fully read.
open Core
let do_hash file =
Md5.digest_file_blocking file |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline
let regular_file =
Command.Arg_type.create (fun filename ->
match Sys.is_file filename with
| `Yes -> filename
| `No -> failwith "Not a regular file"
| `Unknown ->
failwith "Could not determine if this was a regular file")
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let%map_open.Command filename =
anon ("filename" %: regular_file)
in
fun () -> do_hash filename)
let () = Command.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
The regular_file function transforms a filename string parameter into the same
string but rst checks that the le exists and is a regular le type. When you build and
run this code, you will see the new error messages if you try to open a special device
such as /dev/null:
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe md5.ml
5df5ec6301ea37bebc22912ceaa6b2e2
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe /dev/null
Error parsing command line:
failed to parse FILENAME value "/dev/null"
(Failure "Not a regular file")
For usage information, run
md5.exe -help
[1]
16.2.2
Optional and Default Arguments
A more realistic md5 binary could also read from the standard input if a filename isn't
specied. To do this, we need to declare the lename argument as optional, which we
can do with the maybe operator.

16.2 Optional and Default Arguments
287
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let%map_open.Command filename =
anon (maybe ("filename" %: string))
in
fun () -> do_hash filename)
But building this results in a compile-time error.
$ dune build md5.exe
File "md5.ml", line 15, characters 23-31:
15 |
fun () -> do_hash filename)
^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type string option
but an expression was expected of type string
[1]
This is because changing the argument type has also changed the type of the value
that is returned by the parser. It now produces a string option instead of a string,
reecting the optionality of the argument. We can adapt our example to use the new
information and read from standard input if no le is specied.
open Core
let get_contents = function
| None | Some "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
| Some filename -> In_channel.read_all filename
let do_hash filename =
get_contents filename
|> Md5.digest_string
|> Md5.to_hex
|> print_endline
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let%map_open.Command filename =
anon (maybe ("filename" %: Filename.arg_type))
in
fun () -> do_hash filename)
let () = Command.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
The filename parameter to do_hash is now a string option type. This is resolved
into a string via get_contents to determine whether to read the standard input or a
le, and then the rest of the command is similar to our previous examples.
$ cat md5.ml | dune exec -- ./md5.exe
54fd98cd30f8faa76be46be0005f00bf
Another possible way to handle this would be to supply a dash as the default
lename if one isn't specied. The maybe_with_default function can do just this, with
the benet of not having to change the callback parameter type.

288
Command-Line Parsing
The following example behaves exactly the same as the previous example, but
replaces maybe with maybe_with_default:
open Core
let get_contents = function
| "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
| filename -> In_channel.read_all filename
let do_hash filename =
get_contents filename
|> Md5.digest_string
|> Md5.to_hex
|> print_endline
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let%map_open.Command filename =
anon (maybe_with_default "-" ("filename" %: Filename.arg_type))
in
fun () -> do_hash filename)
let () = Command.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
Building and running this conrms that it has the same behavior as before.
$ cat md5.ml | dune exec -- ./md5.exe
f0ea4085ca226eef2c0d70026619a244
16.2.3
Sequences of Arguments
Another common way of parsing anonymous arguments is as a variable length list. As
an example, let's modify our MD5 code to take a collection of les to process on the
command line.
open Core
let get_contents = function
| "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
| filename -> In_channel.read_all filename
let do_hash filename =
get_contents filename
|> Md5.digest_string
|> Md5.to_hex
|> fun md5 -> printf "MD5 (%s) = %s\n" filename md5
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
(let%map_open.Command files =
anon (sequence ("filename" %: Filename.arg_type))

16.3 Adding Labeled Flags
289
in
fun () ->
match files with
| [] -> do_hash "-"
| _ -> List.iter files ~f:do_hash)
let () = Command.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
The callback function is a little more complex now, to handle the extra options. The
files are now a string list, and an empty list reverts to using standard input, just
as our previous maybe and maybe_with_default examples did. If the list of les isn't
empty, then it opens up each le and runs them through do_hash sequentially.
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe /etc/services ./_build/default/md5.exe
MD5 (/etc/services) = 6501e9c7bf20b1dc56f015e341f79833
MD5 (./_build/default/md5.exe) = 6602408aa98478ba5617494f7460d3d9
16.3
Adding Labeled Flags
You aren't limited to anonymous arguments on the command line. A ag is a named
eld that can be followed by an optional argument. These ags can appear in any order
on the command line, or multiple times, depending on how they're declared in the
specication.
Let's add two arguments to our md5 command that mimics the macOS version. A
-s ag species the string to be hashed directly on the command line and -t runs a
self-test. The complete example follows.
open Core
let checksum_from_string buf =
Md5.digest_string buf |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline
let checksum_from_file filename =
let contents =
match filename with
| "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
| filename -> In_channel.read_all filename
in
Md5.digest_string contents |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline
let command =
Command.basic
~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
(let%map_open.Command use_string =
flag
"-s"
(optional string)
~doc:"string Checksum the given string"
and trial = flag "-t" no_arg ~doc:" run a built-in time trial"
and filename =
anon (maybe_with_default "-" ("filename" %: Filename.arg_type))
in

290
Command-Line Parsing
fun () ->
if trial
then printf "Running time trial\n"
else (
match use_string with
| Some buf -> checksum_from_string buf
| None -> checksum_from_file filename))
let () = Command.run command
The specication now uses the flag function to dene the two new labeled,
command-line arguments. The doc string is formatted so that the rst word is the
short name that appears in the usage text, with the remainder being the full help text.
Notice that the -t ag has no argument, and so we prepend its doc text with a blank
space. The help text for the preceding code looks like this:
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -help
Generate an MD5 hash of the input data
md5.exe [FILENAME]
=== flags ===
[-s string]
Checksum the given string
[-t]
run a built-in time trial
[-build-info]
print info about this build and exit
[-version]
print the version of this build and exit
[-help]
print this help text and exit
(alias: -?)
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -s "ocaml rocks"
5a118fe92ac3b6c7854c595ecf6419cb
The -s ag in our specication requires a string argument and isn't optional.
The Command parser outputs an error message if the ag isn't supplied, as with the
anonymous arguments in earlier examples. There are a number of other functions that
you can wrap ags in to control how they are parsed:
• required <arg> will return <arg> and error if not present
• optional <arg> with return <arg> option
• optional_with_default <val> <arg> will return <arg> with default <val> if not
present
• listed <arg> will return <arg> list (this ag may appear multiple times)
• no_arg will return a bool that is true if the ag is present
The ags aect the type of the callback function in exactly the same way as anony-
mous arguments do. This lets you change the specication and ensure that all the
callback functions are updated appropriately, without runtime errors.

16.4 Grouping Subcommands Together
291
16.4
Grouping Subcommands Together
You can get pretty far by using ags and anonymous arguments to assemble complex,
command-line interfaces. After a while, though, too many options can make the pro-
gram very confusing for newcomers to your application. One way to solve this is by
grouping common operations together and adding some hierarchy to the command-line
interface.
You'll have run across this style already when using the opam package manager (or,
in the non-OCaml world, the Git or Mercurial commands). opam exposes commands
in this form:
$ opam env
$ opam remote list -k git
$ opam install --help
$ opam install core --verbose
The config, remote, and install keywords form a logical grouping of commands
that factor out a set of ags and arguments. This lets you prevent ags that are specic
to a particular subcommand from leaking into the general conguration space.
This usually only becomes a concern when your application organically grows
features. Luckily, it's simple to extend your application to do this in Command: just
use Command.group, which lets you merge a collection of Command.t's into one.
# Command.group;;
- : summary:string ->
?readme:(unit -> string) ->
?preserve_subcommand_order:unit ->
?body:(path:string list -> unit) ->
(string * Command.t) list -> Command.t
= <fun>
The group signature accepts a list of basic Command.t values and their corresponding
names. When executed, it looks for the appropriate subcommand from the name list,
and dispatches it to the right command handler.
Let's build the outline of a calendar tool that does a few operations over dates from
the command line. We rst need to dene a command that adds days to an input date
and prints the resulting date:
open Core
let add =
Command.basic
~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
(let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
and days = anon ("days" %: int) in
fun () ->
Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline)
let () = Command.run add
Everything in this command should be familiar to you by now, and it works as you
might expect.

292
Command-Line Parsing
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe -help
Add [days] to the [base] date and print day
cal.exe BASE DAYS
=== flags ===
[-build-info]
print info about this build and exit
[-version]
print the version of this build and exit
[-help]
print this help text and exit
(alias: -?)
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe 2012-12-25 40
2013-02-03
Now, let's also add the ability to take the dierence between two dates, but, in-
stead of creating a new binary, we'll group both operations as subcommands using
Command.group.
open Core
let add =
Command.basic
~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date"
Command.Let_syntax.(
let%map_open base = anon ("base" %: date)
and days = anon ("days" %: int) in
fun () ->
Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline)
let diff =
Command.basic
~summary:"Show days between [date1] and [date2]"
(let%map_open.Command date1 = anon ("date1" %: date)
and date2 = anon ("date2" %: date) in
fun () -> Date.diff date1 date2 |> printf "%d days\n")
let command =
Command.group
~summary:"Manipulate dates"
[ "add", add; "diff", diff ]
let () = Command.run command
And that's all you really need to add subcommand support! Let's build the example
rst in the usual way and inspect the help output, which now reects the subcommands
we just added.
(executable
(name
cal)
(libraries
core)
(preprocess (pps ppx_jane)))
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe -help
Manipulate dates

16.5 Prompting for Interactive Input
293
cal.exe SUBCOMMAND
=== subcommands ===
add
Add [days] to the [base] date
diff
Show days between [date1] and [date2]
version
print version information
help
explain a given subcommand (perhaps recursively)
We can invoke the two commands we just dened to verify that they work and see
the date parsing in action:
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe add 2012-12-25 40
2013-02-03
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe diff 2012-12-25 2012-11-01
54 days
16.5
Prompting for Interactive Input
Sometimes, if a value isn't provided on the command line, you want to prompt for it
instead. Let's return to the calendar tool we built before.
open Core
let add =
Command.basic
~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
(let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
and days = anon ("days" %: int) in
fun () ->
Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline)
let () = Command.run add
This program requires you to specify both the base date and the number of days to
add onto it. If days isn't supplied on the command line, an error is output. Now let's
modify it to interactively prompt for a number of days if only the base date is supplied.
open Core
let add_days base days =
Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline
let prompt_for_string name of_string =
printf "enter %s: %!" name;
match In_channel.input_line In_channel.stdin with
| None -> failwith "no value entered. aborting."
| Some line -> of_string line
let add =
Command.basic
~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
(let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
and days = anon (maybe ("days" %: int)) in

294
Command-Line Parsing
let days =
match days with
| Some x -> x
| None -> prompt_for_string "days" Int.of_string
in
fun () -> add_days base days)
let () = Command.run add
The days anonymous argument is now an optional integer in the spec, and when
it isn't there, we simply prompt for the value as part of the ordinary execution of our
program.
Sometimes, it's convenient to pack the prompting behavior into the parser itself. For
one thing, this would allow you to easily share the prompting behavior among multiple
commands. This is easy enough to do by adding a new function, anon_prompt, which
creates a parser that automatically prompts if the value isn't provided.
let anon_prompt name of_string =
let arg = Command.Arg_type.create of_string in
let%map_open.Command value = anon (maybe (name %: arg)) in
match value with
| Some v -> v
| None -> prompt_for_string name of_string
let add =
Command.basic
~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
(let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
and days = anon_prompt "days" Int.of_string in
fun () -> add_days base days)
We can see the prompting behavior if we run the program without providing the
second argument.
$ echo 35 | dune exec -- ./cal.exe 2013-12-01
enter days: 2014-01-05
16.6
Command-Line Autocompletion with bash
Modern UNIX shells usually have a tab-completion feature to interactively help you
gure out how to build a command line. These work by pressing the Tab key in the
middle of typing a command, and seeing the options that pop up. You've probably used
this most often to nd the les in the current directory, but it can actually be extended
for other parts of the command, too.
The precise mechanism for autocompletion varies depending on what shell you are
using, but we'll assume you are using the most common one: bash. This is the default
interactive shell on most Linux distributions and macOS, but you may need to switch
to it on *BSD or Windows (when using Cygwin). The rest of this section assumes that
you're using bash.

16.6 Installing the Completion Fragment
295
Bash autocompletion isn't always installed by default, so check your OS package
manager to see if you have it available.
• On Debian Linux, do apt install bash-completion
• On macOS Homebrew, do brew install bash-completion
• On FreeBSD, do pkg install bash-completion.
Once bash completion is installed and congured, check that it works by typing the
ssh command and pressing the Tab key. This should show you the list of known hosts
from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts le. If it lists some hosts that you've recently connected
to, you can continue on. If it lists the les in your current directory instead, then check
your OS documentation to congure completion correctly.
One last bit of information you'll need to nd is the location of the
bash_completion.d directory. This is where all the shell fragments that contain the
completion logic are held. On Linux, this is often in /etc/bash_completion.d, and in
Homebrew on macOS, it would be /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d by default.
16.6.1
Generating Completion Fragments from Command
The Command library has a declarative description of all the possible valid options,
and it can use this information to generate a shell script that provides completion
support for that command. To generate the fragment, just run the command with the
COMMAND_OUTPUT_INSTALLATION_BASH environment variable set to any value.
For example, let's try it on our MD5 example from earlier, assuming that the binary
is called md5 in the current directory:
$ env COMMAND_OUTPUT_INSTALLATION_BASH=1 dune exec -- ./md5.exe
function _jsautocom_32087 {
export COMP_CWORD
COMP_WORDS[0]=./md5.exe
if type readarray > /dev/null
then readarray -t COMPREPLY < <("${COMP_WORDS[@]}")
else IFS="
" read -d "" -A COMPREPLY < <("${COMP_WORDS[@]}")
fi
}
complete -F _jsautocom_32087 ./md5.exe
Recall that we used the Arg_type.file to specify the argument type. This also
supplies the completion logic so that you can just press Tab to complete les in your
current directory.
16.6.2
Installing the Completion Fragment
You don't need to worry about what the preceding output script actually does (unless
you have an unhealthy fascination with shell scripting internals, that is). Instead, redirect
the output to a le in your current directory and source it into your current shell:

Command completion support works for ags and grouped commands and is very
useful when building larger command-line interfaces. Don't forget to install the shell
fragment into your global bash_completion.d directory if you want it to be loaded in
all of your login shells.
Installing a Generic Completion Handler
Sadly, bash doesn't support installing a generic handler for all Command-based ap-
plications. This means you have to install the completion script for every application,
but you should be able to automate this in the build and packaging system for your
application.
It will help to check out how other applications install tab-completion scripts and
follow their lead, as the details are very OS-specic.
16.7
Alternative Command-Line Parsers
This rounds up our tour of the Command library. This isn't the only way to parse
command-line arguments of course; there are several alternatives available on opam.
Three of the most prominent ones follow:
The Arg module The Arg module is from the OCaml standard library, which is
used by the compiler itself to handle its command-line interface. Command
is built on top of Arg, but you can also use Arg directly. You can use
the Command.Spec.flags_of_args_exn function to convert Arg specications
into ones compatible with Command, which is a simple way of porting an
Arg-based command line interface to Command.
ocaml-getopt2 ocaml-getopt provides the general command-line syntax of GNU
getopt and getopt_long. The GNU conventions are widely used in the open
source world, and this library lets your OCaml programs obey the same rules.
Cmdliner3 Cmdliner is a mix between the Command and Getopt libraries. It allows
for the declarative denition of command-line interfaces but exposes a more
getopt-like interface. It also automates the generation of UNIX man pages
as part of the specication. Cmdliner is the parser used by opam to manage
its command line.

Concurrent Programming with
Async
The logic of building programs that interact with the outside world is often dominated
by waiting; waiting for the click of a mouse, or for data to be fetched from disk, or
for space to be available on an outgoing network buer. Even mildly sophisticated
interactive applications are typically concurrent, needing to wait for multiple dierent
events at the same time, responding immediately to whatever happens rst.
One approach to concurrency is to use preemptive system threads, which is the
dominant approach in languages like Java or C#. In this model, each task that may
require simultaneous waiting is given an operating system thread of its own so it can
block without stopping the entire program.
Another approach is to have a single-threaded program, where that single thread
runs an event loop whose job is to react to external events like timeouts or mouse
clicks by invoking a callback function that has been registered for that purpose. This
approach shows up in languages like JavaScript that have single-threaded runtimes, as
well as in many GUI toolkits.
Each of these mechanisms has its own trade-os. System threads require signicant
memory and other resources per thread. Also, the operating system can arbitrarily
interleave the execution of system threads, requiring the programmer to carefully
protect shared resources with locks and condition variables, which is exceedingly
error-prone.
Single-threaded event-driven systems, on the other hand, execute a single task at
a time and do not require the same kind of complex synchronization that preemptive
threads do. However, the inverted control structure of an event-driven program often
means that your own control ow has to be threaded awkwardly through the system's
event loop, leading to a maze of event callbacks.
This chapter covers the Async library, which oers a hybrid model that aims to
provide the best of both worlds, avoiding the performance compromises and synchro-
nization woes of preemptive threads without the confusing inversion of control that
usually comes with event-driven systems.
17.1
Async Basics
Recall how I/O is typically done in Core. Here's a simple example.
# open Core;;

298
Concurrent Programming with Async
# #show In_channel.read_all;;
val read_all : string -> string
# Out_channel.write_all "test.txt" ~data:"This is only a test.";;
- : unit = ()
# In_channel.read_all "test.txt";;
- : string = "This is only a test."
From the type of In_channel.read_all, you can see that it must be a blocking
operation. In particular, the fact that it returns a concrete string means it can't return
until the read has completed. The blocking nature of the call means that no progress
can be made on anything else until the call is complete.
In Async, well-behaved functions never block. Instead, they return a value of type
Deferred.t that acts as a placeholder that will eventually be lled in with the result. As
an example, consider the signature of the Async equivalent of In_channel.read_all.
# #require "async";;
# open Async;;
# #show Reader.file_contents;;
val file_contents : string -> string Deferred.t
We rst load the Async package in the toplevel using #require, and then open the
module. Async, like Core, is designed to be an extension to your basic programming
environment, and is intended to be opened.
A deferred is essentially a handle to a value that may be computed in the future. As
such, if we call Reader.file_contents, the resulting deferred will initially be empty,
as you can see by calling Deferred.peek.
# let contents = Reader.file_contents "test.txt";;
val contents : string Deferred.t = <abstr>
# Deferred.peek contents;;
- : string option = None
The value in contents isn't yet determined partly because nothing running could do
the necessary I/O. When using Async, processing of I/O and other events is handled
by the Async scheduler. When writing a standalone program, you need to start the
scheduler explicitly, but utop knows about Async and can start the scheduler automat-
ically. More than that, utop knows about deferred values, and when you type in an
expression of type Deferred.t, it will make sure the scheduler is running and block
until the deferred is determined. Thus, we can write:
# contents;;
- : string = "This is only a test."
Slightly confusingly, the type shown here is not the type of contents, which is
string Deferred.t, but rather string, the type of the value contained within that
deferred.
If we peek again, we'll see that the value of contents has been lled in.
# Deferred.peek contents;;
- : string option = Some "This is only a test."
In order to do real work with deferreds, we need a way of waiting for a deferred
computation to nish, which we do using Deferred.bind. Here's the type-signature of
bind.

17.1 Async Basics
299
# #show Deferred.bind;;
val bind : 'a Deferred.t -> f:('a -> 'b Deferred.t) -> 'b Deferred.t
bind is eectively a way of sequencing concurrent computations. In particular,
Deferred.bind d ~f causes f to be called after the value of d has been determined.
Here's a simple use of bind for a function that replaces a le with an uppercase
version of its contents.
# let uppercase_file filename =
Deferred.bind (Reader.file_contents filename)
~f:(fun text ->
Writer.save filename ~contents:(String.uppercase text));;
val uppercase_file : string -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
# uppercase_file "test.txt";;
- : unit = ()
# Reader.file_contents "test.txt";;
- : string = "THIS IS ONLY A TEST."
Again, bind is acting as a sequencing operator, causing the le to be saved
via the call to Writer.save only after the contents of the le were rst read via
Reader.file_contents.
Writing out Deferred.bind explicitly can be rather verbose, and so Async includes
an inx operator for it: >>=. Using this operator, we can rewrite uppercase_file as
follows:
# let uppercase_file filename =
Reader.file_contents filename
>>= fun text ->
Writer.save filename ~contents:(String.uppercase text);;
val uppercase_file : string -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
Here, we've dropped the parentheses around the function on the right-hand side of
the bind, and we didn't add a level of indentation for the contents of that function. This
is standard practice for using the inx bind operator.
Now let's look at another potential use of bind. In this case, we'll write a function
that counts the number of lines in a le:
# let count_lines filename =
Reader.file_contents filename
>>= fun text ->
List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n');;
Line 4, characters 5-45:
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of
type
'a Deferred.t
This looks reasonable enough, but as you can see, the compiler is unhappy. The
issue here is that bind expects a function that returns a Deferred.t, but we've provided
it with a function that returns the result directly. What we need is return, a function
provided by Async that takes an ordinary value and wraps it up in a deferred.
# #show_val return;;
val return : 'a -> 'a Deferred.t
# let three = return 3;;

300
Concurrent Programming with Async
val three : int Deferred.t = <abstr>
# three;;
- : int = 3
Using return, we can make count_lines compile:
# let count_lines filename =
Reader.file_contents filename
>>= fun text ->
return (List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n'));;
val count_lines : string -> int Deferred.t = <fun>
Together, bind and return form a design pattern in functional programming known
as a monad. You'll run across this signature in many applications beyond just threads.
Indeed, we already ran across monads in Chapter 8.1.3 (bind and Other Error Handling
Idioms).
Calling bind and return together is a fairly common pattern, and as such there is a
standard shortcut for it called Deferred.map, which has the following signature:
# #show Deferred.map;;
val map : 'a Deferred.t -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'b Deferred.t
and comes with its own inx equivalent, >>|. Using it, we can rewrite count_lines
again a bit more succinctly:
# let count_lines filename =
Reader.file_contents filename
>>| fun text ->
List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n');;
val count_lines : string -> int Deferred.t = <fun>
# count_lines "/etc/hosts";;
- : int = 10
Note that count_lines returns a deferred, but utop waits for that deferred to become
determined, and shows us the contents of the deferred instead.
17.1.1
Using Let Syntax
As was discussed in Chapter 8.1.3 (bind and Other Error Handling Idioms), there is a
special syntax, which we call let syntax, designed for working with monads, which we
can enable by enabling ppx_let.
# #require "ppx_let";;
Here's what the bind-using version of count_lines looks like using that syntax.
# let count_lines filename =
let%bind text = Reader.file_contents filename in
return (List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n'));;
val count_lines : string -> int Deferred.t = <fun>
And here's the map-based version of count_lines.
# let count_lines filename =
let%map text = Reader.file_contents filename in
List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n');;
val count_lines : string -> int Deferred.t = <fun>

17.1 Ivars and Upon
301
The dierence here is just syntactic, with these examples compiling down to the
same thing as the corresponding examples written using inx operators. What's nice
about let syntax is that it highlights the analogy between monadic bind and OCaml's
built-in let-binding, thereby making your code more uniform and more readable.
Let syntax works for any monad, and you decide which monad is in use by
opening the appropriate Let_syntax module. Opening Async also implicitly opens
Deferred.Let_syntax, but in some contexts you may want to do that explicitly.
For the most part, let syntax is easier to read and work with, and you should default
to it when using Async, which is what we'll do for the remainder of the chapter.
17.1.2
Ivars and Upon
Deferreds are usually built using combinations of bind, map and return, but sometimes
you want to construct a deferred where you can programmatically decide when it gets
lled in. This can be done using an ivar. (The term ivar dates back to a language called
Concurrent ML that was developed by John Reppy in the early '90s. The i in ivar
stands for incremental.)
There are three fundamental operations for working with an ivar: you can create
one, using Ivar.create; you can read o the deferred that corresponds to the ivar in
question, using Ivar.read; and you can ll an ivar, thus causing the corresponding
deferred to become determined, using Ivar.fill. These operations are illustrated
below:
# let ivar = Ivar.create ();;
val ivar : '_weak1 Ivar.t =
{Async_kernel__.Types.Ivar.cell = Async_kernel__Types.Cell.Empty}
# let def = Ivar.read ivar;;
val def : '_weak2 Deferred.t = <abstr>
# Deferred.peek def;;
- : '_weak3 option = None
# Ivar.fill ivar "Hello";;
- : unit = ()
# Deferred.peek def;;
- : string option = Some "Hello"
Ivars are something of a low-level feature; operators like map, bind and return are
typically easier to use and think about. But ivars can be useful when you want to build
a synchronization pattern that isn't already well supported.
As an example, imagine we wanted a way of scheduling a sequence of actions that
would run after a xed delay. In addition, we'd like to guarantee that these delayed
actions are executed in the same order they were scheduled in. Here's a signature that
captures this idea:
# module type Delayer_intf = sig
type t
val create : Time.Span.t -> t
val schedule : t -> (unit -> 'a Deferred.t) -> 'a Deferred.t
end;;
module type Delayer_intf =

302
Concurrent Programming with Async
sig
type t
val create : Time.Span.t -> t
val schedule : t -> (unit -> 'a Deferred.t) -> 'a Deferred.t
end
An action is handed to schedule in the form of a deferred-returning thunk (a thunk
is a function whose argument is of type unit). A deferred is handed back to the caller of
schedule that will eventually be lled with the contents of the deferred value returned
by the thunk. To implement this, we'll use an operator called upon, which has the
following signature:
# #show upon;;
val upon : 'a Deferred.t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit
Like bind and return, upon schedules a callback to be executed when the deferred
it is passed is determined; but unlike those calls, it doesn't create a new deferred for
this callback to ll.
Our delayer implementation is organized around a queue of thunks, where every
call to schedule adds a thunk to the queue and also schedules a job in the future to grab
a thunk o the queue and run it. The waiting will be done using the function after,
which takes a time span and returns a deferred which becomes determined after that
time span elapses:
# module Delayer : Delayer_intf = struct
type t = { delay: Time.Span.t;
jobs: (unit -> unit) Queue.t;
}
let create delay =
{ delay; jobs = Queue.create () }
let schedule t thunk =
let ivar = Ivar.create () in
Queue.enqueue t.jobs (fun () ->
upon (thunk ()) (fun x -> Ivar.fill ivar x));
upon (after t.delay) (fun () ->
let job = Queue.dequeue_exn t.jobs in
job ());
Ivar.read ivar
end;;
module Delayer : Delayer_intf
This code isn't particularly long, but it is subtle. In particular, note how the queue
of thunks is used to ensure that the enqueued actions are run in the order they were
scheduled, even if the thunks scheduled by upon are run out of order. This kind of
subtlety is typical of code that involves ivars and upon, and because of this, you should
stick to the simpler map/bind/return style of working with deferreds when you can.
Understanding bind in Terms of Ivars and upon
Here's roughly what happens when you write let d' = Deferred.bind d ~f.

17.2 Example: An Echo Server
303
• A new ivar i is created to hold the nal result of the computation. The corresponding
deferred is returned
• A function is registered to be called when the deferred d becomes determined.
• That function, once run, calls f with the value that was determined for d.
• Another function is registered to be called when the deferred returned by f becomes
determined.
• When that function is called, it uses it to ll i, causing the corresponding deferred
it to become determined.
That sounds like a lot, but we can implement this relatively concisely.
# let my_bind d ~f =
let i = Ivar.create () in
upon d (fun x -> upon (f x) (fun y -> Ivar.fill i y));
Ivar.read i;;
val my_bind : 'a Deferred.t -> f:('a -> 'b Deferred.t) -> 'b Deferred.t
=
<fun>
Async's real implementation has more optimizations and is therefore more compli-
cated. But the above implementation is still a useful rst-order mental model for how
bind works under the covers. And it's another good example of how upon and ivars can
be useful for building concurrency primitives.
17.2
Example: An Echo Server
Now that we have the basics of Async under our belt, let's look at a small standalone
Async program. In particular, we'll write an echo server, i.e., a program that accepts
connections from clients and spits back whatever is sent to it.
The rst step is to create a function that can copy data from an input to an output.
Here, we'll use Async's Reader and Writer modules, which provide a convenient
abstraction for working with input and output channels:
open Core
open Async
(* Copy data from the reader to the writer, using the provided buffer
as scratch space *)
let rec copy_blocks buffer r w =
match%bind Reader.read r buffer with
| `Eof -> return ()
| `Ok bytes_read ->
Writer.write w (Bytes.to_string buffer) ~len:bytes_read;
let%bind () = Writer.flushed w in
copy_blocks buffer r w
Bind is used in the code to sequence the operations, with a bind marking each place
we wait.
• First, we call Reader.read to get a block of input.

304
Concurrent Programming with Async
• When that's complete and if a new block was returned, we write that block to the
writer.
• Finally, we wait until the writer's buers are ushed, at which point we recurse.
If we hit an end-of-le condition, the loop is ended. The deferred returned by a call
to copy_blocks becomes determined only once the end-of-le condition is hit.
One important aspect of how copy_blocks is written is that it provides pushback,
which is to say that if the process can't make progress writing, it will stop reading. If
you don't implement pushback in your servers, then anything that prevents you from
writing (e.g., a client that is unable to keep up) will cause your program to allocate
unbounded amounts of memory, as it keeps track of all the data it intends to write but
hasn't been able to yet.
Tail-Calls and Chains of Deferreds
There's another memory problem you might be concerned about, which is the allocation
of deferreds. If you think about the execution of copy_blocks, you'll see it's creating a
chain of deferreds, two per time through the loop. The length of this chain is unbounded,
and so, naively, you'd think this would take up an unbounded amount of memory as
the echo process continues.
Happily, this is a case that Async knows how to optimize. In particular, the whole
chain of deferreds should become determined precisely when the nal deferred in the
chain is determined, in this case, when the Eof condition is hit. Because of this, we
could safely replace all of these deferreds with a single deferred. Async does just this,
and so there's no memory leak after all.
This is essentially a form of tail-call optimization, lifted to the Deferred monad.
Indeed, you can tell that the bind in question doesn't lead to a memory leak in more or
less the same way you can tell that the tail recursion optimization should apply, which
is that the bind that creates the deferred is in tail-position. In other words, nothing is
done to that deferred once it's created; it's simply returned as is.
copy_blocks provides the logic for handling a client connection, but we still need to
set up a server to receive such connections and dispatch to copy_blocks. For this, we'll
use Async's Tcp module, which has a collection of utilities for creating TCP clients
and servers:
(** Starts a TCP server, which listens on the specified port, invoking
copy_blocks every time a client connects. *)
let run () =
let host_and_port =
Tcp.Server.create
~on_handler_error:`Raise
(Tcp.Where_to_listen.of_port 8765)
(fun _addr r w ->
let buffer = Bytes.create (16 * 1024) in
copy_blocks buffer r w)
in
ignore
(host_and_port

17.2 Example: An Echo Server
305
: (Socket.Address.Inet.t, int) Tcp.Server.t Deferred.t)
The result of calling Tcp.Server.create is a Tcp.Server.t, which is a handle to
the server that lets you shut the server down. We don't use that functionality here, so
we explicitly ignore server to suppress the unused-variables error. We put in a type
annotation around the ignored value to make the nature of the value we're ignoring
explicit.
The most important argument to Tcp.Server.create is the nal one, which is the
client connection handler. Notably, the preceding code does nothing explicit to close
down the client connections when the communication is done. That's because the
server will automatically shut down the connection once the deferred returned by the
handler becomes determined.
Finally, we need to initiate the server and start the Async scheduler:
(* Call [run], and then start the scheduler *)
let () =
run ();
never_returns (Scheduler.go ())
One of the most common newbie errors with Async is to forget to run the scheduler.
It can be a bewildering mistake, because without the scheduler, your program won't
do anything at all; even calls to printf won't reach the terminal.
It's worth noting that even though we didn't spend much explicit eort on thinking
about multiple clients, this server is able to handle many clients concurrently connecting
and reading and writing data.
Now that we have the echo server, we can connect to the echo server using the
netcat tool, which is invoked as nc. Note that we use dune exec to both build and run
the executable. We use the double-dashes so that Dune's parsing of arguments doesn't
interfere with argument parsing for the executed program.
$ dune exec -- ./echo.exe &
$ echo "This is an echo server" | nc 127.0.0.1 8765
This is an echo server
$ echo "It repeats whatever I write" | nc 127.0.0.1 8765
It repeats whatever I write
$ killall echo.exe
Functions that Never Return
The call to never_returns around the call to Scheduler.go is a little bit surprising, but
it has a purpose: to make it clear to whoever invokes Scheduler.go that the function
never returns.
By default, a function that doesn't return will have an inferred return type of 'a:
# let rec loop_forever () = loop_forever ();;
val loop_forever : unit -> 'a = <fun>
# let always_fail () = assert false;;
val always_fail : unit -> 'a = <fun>
This is a little odd, but it does make sense. After all, if a function never returns,
we're free to impute any type at all to its non-existent return value. As a result, from

306
Concurrent Programming with Async
a typing perspective, a function that never returns can t into any context within your
program.
But that itself can be problematic, especially with a function like Scheduler.go,
where the fact that it never returns is perhaps not entirely obvious. The point of
never_returns is to create an explicit marker so the user knows that the function in
question doesn't return.
To do this, Scheduler.go is dened to have a return value of Nothing.t.
# #show Scheduler.go;;
val go : ?raise_unhandled_exn:bool -> unit -> never_returns
never_returns is just an alias of Nothing.t.
Nothing.t is uninhabited, which means there are no values of that type. As such, a
function can't actually return a value of type Nothing.t, so only a function that never
returns can have Nothing.t as its return type! And we can cause a function that never
returns to have a return value of Nothing.t by just adding a type annotation.
# let rec loop_forever () : Nothing.t = loop_forever ();;
val loop_forever : unit -> never_returns = <fun>
The function never_returns consumes a value of type Nothing.t and returns an
unconstrained type 'a.
# #show_val never_returns;;
val never_returns : never_returns -> 'a
If you try to write a function that uses Scheduler.go, and just assumes that it returns
unit, you'll get a helpful type error.
# let do_stuff n =
let x = 3 in
if n > 0 then Scheduler.go ();
x + n;;
Line 3, characters 19-34:
Error: This expression has type never_returns
but an expression was expected of type unit
because it is in the result of a conditional with no else
branch
We can x this by inserting a call to never_returns, thus making the fact that
Scheduler.go doesn't return apparent to the reader.
# let do_stuff n =
let x = 3 in
if n > 0 then never_returns (Scheduler.go ());
x + n;;
val do_stuff : int -> int = <fun>
17.2.1
Improving the Echo Server
Let's try to go a little bit farther with our echo server by walking through a few
improvements. In particular, we will:

17.2 Improving the Echo Server
307
• Add a proper command-line interface with Command
• Add a ag to specify the port to listen on and a ag to make the server echo back the
capitalized version of whatever was sent to it
• Simplify the code using Async's Pipe interface
The following code does all of this:
open Core
open Async
let run ~uppercase ~port =
let host_and_port =
Tcp.Server.create
~on_handler_error:`Raise
(Tcp.Where_to_listen.of_port port)
(fun _addr r w ->
Pipe.transfer
(Reader.pipe r)
(Writer.pipe w)
~f:(if uppercase then String.uppercase else Fn.id))
in
ignore
(host_and_port
: (Socket.Address.Inet.t, int) Tcp.Server.t Deferred.t);
Deferred.never ()
let () =
Command.async
~summary:"Start an echo server"
(let%map_open.Command uppercase =
flag
"-uppercase"
no_arg
~doc:" Convert to uppercase before echoing back"
and port =
flag
"-port"
(optional_with_default 8765 int)
~doc:" Port to listen on (default 8765)"
in
fun () -> run ~uppercase ~port)
|> Command.run
Note the use of Deferred.never in the run function. As you might guess from the
name, Deferred.never returns a deferred that is never determined. In this case, that
indicates that the echo server doesn't ever shut down.
The biggest change in the preceding code is the use of Async's Pipe. A Pipe is
an asynchronous communication channel that's used for connecting dierent parts of
your program. You can think of it as a consumer/producer queue that uses deferreds for
communicating when the pipe is ready to be read from or written to. Our use of pipes
is fairly minimal here, but they are an important part of Async, so it's worth discussing
them in some detail.
Pipes are created in connected read/write pairs:

308
Concurrent Programming with Async
# let (r,w) = Pipe.create ();;
val r : '_weak4 Pipe.Reader.t = <abstr>
val w : '_weak4 Pipe.Writer.t = <abstr>
r and w are really just read and write handles to the same underlying object. Note
that r and w have weakly polymorphic types, as discussed in Chapter 9 (Imperative
Programming), and so can only contain values of a single, yet-to-be-determined type.
If we just try and write to the writer, we'll see that we block indenitely in utop.
You can break out of the wait by hitting Control-C:
# Pipe.write w "Hello World!";;
Interrupted.
That's because a pipe has a certain amount of internal slack, a number of slots in
the pipe to which something can be written before the write will block. By default, a
pipe has zero slack, which means that the deferred returned by a write is determined
only when the value is read out of the pipe.
# let (r,w) = Pipe.create ();;
val r : '_weak5 Pipe.Reader.t = <abstr>
val w : '_weak5 Pipe.Writer.t = <abstr>
# let write_complete = Pipe.write w "Hello World!";;
val write_complete : unit Deferred.t = <abstr>
# Pipe.read r;;
- : [ `Eof | `Ok of string ] = `Ok "Hello World!"
# write_complete;;
- : unit = ()
In the function run, we're taking advantage of one of the many utility functions
provided for pipes in the Pipe module. In particular, we're using Pipe.transfer to set
up a process that takes data from a reader-pipe and moves it to a writer-pipe. Here's
the type of Pipe.transfer:
# Pipe.transfer;;
- : 'a Pipe.Reader.t -> 'b Pipe.Writer.t -> f:('a -> 'b) -> unit
Deferred.t =
<fun>
The two pipes being connected are generated by the Reader.pipe and Writer.pipe
call respectively. Note that pushback is preserved throughout the process, so that if
the writer gets blocked, the writer's pipe will stop pulling data from the reader's pipe,
which will prevent the reader from reading in more data.
Importantly, the deferred returned by Pipe.transfer becomes determined once
the reader has been closed and the last element is transferred from the reader to
the writer. Once that deferred becomes determined, the server will shut down that
client connection. So, when a client disconnects, the rest of the shutdown happens
transparently.
The command-line parsing for this program is based on the Command library that
we introduced in Chapter 16 (Command-Line Parsing). Opening Async, shadows the
Command module with an extended version that contains the async call:
# #show Command.async_spec;;
val async_spec :

17.3 URI Handling
309
('a, unit Deferred.t) Async.Command.basic_spec_command
Command.with_options
This diers from the ordinary Command.basic call in that the main function must
return a Deferred.t, and that the running of the command (using Command.run) auto-
matically starts the Async scheduler, without requiring an explicit call to Scheduler.go.
17.3
Example: Searching Denitions with DuckDuckGo
DuckDuckGo is a search engine with a freely available search interface. In this section,
we'll use Async to write a small command-line utility for querying DuckDuckGo to
extract denitions for a collection of terms.
Our code is going to rely on a number of other libraries, all of which can be installed
using opam. Refer to the installation instructions1 if you need help on the installation.
Here's the list of libraries we'll need:
textwrap A library for wrapping long lines. We'll use this for printing out our results.
uri A library for handling URIs, or Uniform Resource Identiers, of which HTTP
URLs are an example.
yojson A JSON parsing library that was described in Handling Json Data2.
cohttp A library for creating HTTP clients and servers. We need Async support,
which comes with the cohttp-async package.
Now let's dive into the implementation.
17.3.1
URI Handling
HTTP URLs, which identify endpoints across the Web, are actually part of a more gen-
eral family known as Uniform Resource Identiers (URIs). The full URI specication
is dened in RFC39863 and is rather complicated. Luckily, the uri library provides a
strongly typed interface that takes care of much of the hassle.
We'll need a function for generating the URIs that we're going to use to query the
DuckDuckGo servers:
open Core
open Async
(* Generate a DuckDuckGo search URI from a query string *)
let query_uri query =
let base_uri =
Uri.of_string "http://api.duckduckgo.com/?format=json"
in
Uri.add_query_param base_uri ("q", [ query ])
1 http://dev.realworldocaml.org/install.html
2 json.html#handling-json-data
3 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986

310
Concurrent Programming with Async
A Uri.t is constructed from the Uri.of_string function, and a query parameter
q is added with the desired search query. The library takes care of encoding the URI
correctly when outputting it in the network protocol.
17.3.2
Parsing JSON Strings
The HTTP response from DuckDuckGo is in JSON, a common (and thankfully simple)
format that is specied in RFC46274. We'll parse the JSON data using the Yojson
library, which was introduced in Chapter 19 (Handling JSON Data).
We expect the response from DuckDuckGo to come across as a JSON record, which
is represented by the Assoc tag in Yojson's JSON variant. We expect the denition itself
to come across under either the key Abstract or Denition, and so the following
code looks under both keys, returning the rst one for which a nonempty value is
dened:
(* Extract the "Definition" or "Abstract" field from the DuckDuckGo
results *)
let get_definition_from_json json =
match Yojson.Safe.from_string json with
| `Assoc kv_list ->
let find key =
match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal kv_list key with
| None | Some (`String "") -> None
| Some s -> Some (Yojson.Safe.to_string s)
in
(match find "Abstract" with
| Some _ as x -> x
| None -> find "Definition")
| _ -> None
17.3.3
Executing an HTTP Client Query
Now let's look at the code for dispatching the search queries over HTTP, using the
Cohttp library:
(* Execute the DuckDuckGo search *)
let get_definition word =
let%bind _, body = Cohttp_async.Client.get (query_uri word) in
let%map string = Cohttp_async.Body.to_string body in
word, get_definition_from_json string
To better understand what's going on, it's useful to look at the type for
Cohttp_async.Client.get, which we can do in utop:
# #require "cohttp-async";;
# #show Cohttp_async.Client.get;;
val get :
?interrupt:unit Deferred.t ->
?ssl_config:Conduit_async.V2.Ssl.Config.t ->
?headers:Cohttp.Header.t ->
Uri.t -> (Cohttp.Response.t * Cohttp_async.Body.t) Deferred.t
4 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt

17.3 Executing an HTTP Client Query
311
The get call takes as a required argument a URI and returns a deferred value
containing a Cohttp.Response.t (which we ignore) and a pipe reader to which the
body of the request will be streamed.
In
this
case,
the
HTTP
body
probably
isn't
very
large,
so
we
call
Cohttp_async.Body.to_string to collect the data from the connection as a single
deferred string, rather than consuming the data incrementally.
Running a single search isn't that interesting from a concurrency perspective, so
let's write code for dispatching multiple searches in parallel. First, we need code for
formatting and printing out the search result:
(* Print out a word/definition pair *)
let print_result (word, definition) =
printf
"%s\n%s\n\n%s\n\n"
word
(String.init (String.length word) ~f:(fun _ -> '-'))
(match definition with
| None -> "No definition found"
| Some def ->
String.concat ~sep:"\n" (Wrapper.wrap (Wrapper.make 70) def))
We use the Wrapper module from the textwrap package to do the line wrapping. It
may not be obvious that this routine is using Async, but it does: the version of printf
that's called here is actually Async's specialized printf that goes through the Async
scheduler rather than printing directly. The original denition of printf is shadowed by
this new one when you open Async. An important side eect of this is that if you write
an Async program and forget to start the scheduler, calls like printf won't actually
generate any output!
The next function dispatches the searches in parallel, waits for the results, and then
prints:
(* Run many searches in parallel, printing out the results after
they're all done. *)
let search_and_print words =
let%map results = Deferred.all (List.map words ~f:get_definition) in
List.iter results ~f:print_result
We used List.map to call get_definition on each word, and Deferred.all to wait
for all the results. Here's the type of Deferred.all:
# Deferred.all;;
- : 'a Deferred.t list -> 'a list Deferred.t = <fun>
The list returned by Deferred.all reects the order of the deferreds passed to it.
As such, the denitions will be printed out in the same order that the search words are
passed in, no matter what order the queries return in. It also means that no printing
occurs until all results arrive.
We could rewrite this code to print out the results as they're received (and thus
potentially out of order) as follows:
(* Run many searches in parallel, printing out the results as you
go *)

312
Concurrent Programming with Async
let search_and_print words =
Deferred.all_unit
(List.map words ~f:(fun word ->
get_definition word >>| print_result))
The dierence is that we both dispatch the query and print out the result in the
closure passed to map, rather than wait for all of the results to get back and then print
them out together. We use Deferred.all_unit, which takes a list of unit deferreds
and returns a single unit deferred that becomes determined when every deferred on
the input list is determined. We can see the type of this function in utop:
# Deferred.all_unit;;
- : unit Deferred.t list -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
Finally, we create a command-line interface using Command.async:
let () =
Command.async
~summary:"Retrieve definitions from duckduckgo search engine"
(let%map_open.Command words =
anon (sequence ("word" %: string))
in
fun () -> search_and_print words)
|> Command.run
And that's all we need for a simple but usable denition searcher:
$ dune exec -- ./search.exe "Concurrent Programming" "OCaml"

17.4
Exception Handling
When programming with external resources, errors are everywhere. Everything from a
aky server to a network outage to exhausting of local resources can lead to a runtime
error. When programming in OCaml, some of these errors will show up explicitly in

17.4 Exception Handling
313
a function's return type, and some of them will show up as exceptions. We covered
exception handling in OCaml in Chapter 8.2 (Exceptions), but as we'll see, exception
handling in a concurrent program presents some new challenges.
Let's get a better sense of how exceptions work in Async by creating an asynchronous
computation that (sometimes) fails with an exception. The function maybe_raise blocks
for half a second, and then either throws an exception or returns unit, alternating
between the two behaviors on subsequent calls:
# let maybe_raise =
let should_fail = ref false in
fun () ->
let will_fail = !should_fail in
should_fail := not will_fail;
let%map () = after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.5) in
if will_fail then raise Exit else ();;
val maybe_raise : unit -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
# maybe_raise ();;
- : unit = ()
# maybe_raise ();;
Exception: (monitor.ml.Error Exit ("Caught by monitor
block_on_async"))
In utop, the exception thrown by maybe_raise () terminates the evaluation of just
that expression, but in a standalone program, an uncaught exception would bring down
the entire process.
So, how could we capture and handle such an exception? You might try to do this
using OCaml's built-in try/with expression, but as you can see that doesn't quite do
the trick:
# let handle_error () =
try
let%map () = maybe_raise () in
"success"
with _ -> return "failure";;
val handle_error : unit -> string Deferred.t = <fun>
# handle_error ();;
- : string = "success"
# handle_error ();;
Exception: (monitor.ml.Error Exit ("Caught by monitor
block_on_async"))
This didn't work because try/with only captures exceptions that are thrown by the
code executed synchronously within it, while maybe_raise schedules an Async job
that will throw an exception in the future, after the try/with expression has exited.
We can capture this kind of asynchronous error using the try_with function provided
by Async. try_with f takes as its argument a deferred-returning thunk f and returns
a deferred that becomes determined either as Ok of whatever f returned, or Error exn
if f threw an exception before its return value became determined.
Here's a trivial example of try_with in action.
# let handle_error () =
match%map try_with (fun () -> maybe_raise ()) with
| Ok ()
-> "success"

314
Concurrent Programming with Async
| Error _ -> "failure";;
val handle_error : unit -> string Deferred.t = <fun>
# handle_error ();;
- : string = "success"
# handle_error ();;
- : string = "failure"
17.4.1
Monitors
try_with is a useful tool for handling exceptions in Async, but it's not the whole story.
All of Async's exception-handling mechanisms, try_with included, are built on top of
Async's system of monitors, which are inspired by the error-handling mechanism in
Erlang of the same name. Monitors are fairly low-level and are only occasionally used
directly, but it's nonetheless worth understanding how they work.
In Async, a monitor is a context that determines what to do when there is an
unhandled exception. Every Async job runs within the context of some monitor, which,
when the job is running, is referred to as the current monitor. When a new Async job
is scheduled, say, using bind or map, it inherits the current monitor of the job that
spawned it.
Monitors are arranged in a treewhen a new monitor is created (say, using
Monitor.create), it is a child of the current monitor. You can explicitly run jobs
within a monitor using within, which takes a thunk that returns a nondeferred value,
or within', which takes a thunk that returns a deferred. Here's an example:
# let blow_up () =
let monitor = Monitor.create ~name:"blow up monitor" () in
within' ~monitor maybe_raise;;
val blow_up : unit -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
# blow_up ();;
- : unit = ()
# blow_up ();;
Exception: (monitor.ml.Error Exit ("Caught by monitor blow up
monitor"))
In addition to the ordinary stack-trace, the exception displays the trace of monitors
through which the exception traveled, starting at the one we created, called blow up
monitor. The other monitors you see come from utop's special handling of deferreds.
Monitors can do more than just augment the error-trace of an exception. You
can also use a monitor to explicitly handle errors delivered to that monitor. The
Monitor.detach_and_get_error_stream call is a particularly important one. It de-
taches the monitor from its parent, handing back the stream of errors that would
otherwise have been delivered to the parent monitor. This allows one to do custom han-
dling of errors, which may include reraising errors to the parent. Here is a very simple
example of a function that captures and ignores errors in the processes it spawns.
# let swallow_error () =
let monitor = Monitor.create () in
Stream.iter (Monitor.detach_and_get_error_stream monitor)
~f:(fun _exn -> printf "an error happened\n");

17.4 Monitors
315
within' ~monitor (fun () ->
let%bind () = after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.25) in
failwith "Kaboom!");;
val swallow_error : unit -> 'a Deferred.t = <fun>
The deferred returned by this function is never determined, since the computation
ends with an exception rather than a return value. That means that if we run this
function in utop, we'll never get our prompt back.
We can x this by using Deferred.any along with a timeout to get a deferred
we know will become determined eventually. Deferred.any takes a list of deferreds,
and returns a deferred which will become determined assuming any of its arguments
becomes determined.
# Deferred.any [ after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.5)
; swallow_error () ];;
an error happened
- : unit = ()
As you can see, the message an error happened is printed out before the timeout
expires.
Here's an example of a monitor that passes some exceptions through to the parent
and handles others. Exceptions are sent to the parent using Monitor.send_exn, with
Monitor.current being called to nd the current monitor, which is the parent of the
newly created monitor.
# exception Ignore_me;;
exception Ignore_me
# let swallow_some_errors exn_to_raise =
let child_monitor
= Monitor.create
() in
let parent_monitor = Monitor.current () in
Stream.iter
(Monitor.detach_and_get_error_stream child_monitor)
~f:(fun error ->
match Monitor.extract_exn error with
| Ignore_me -> printf "ignoring exn\n"
| _ -> Monitor.send_exn parent_monitor error);
within' ~monitor:child_monitor (fun () ->
let%bind () = after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.25) in
raise exn_to_raise);;
val swallow_some_errors : exn -> 'a Deferred.t = <fun>
Note that we use Monitor.extract_exn to grab the underlying exception that was
thrown. Async wraps exceptions it catches with extra information, including the mon-
itor trace, so you need to grab the underlying exception if you want to depend on the
details of the original exception thrown.
If we pass in an exception other than Ignore_me, like, say, the built-in exception
Not_found, then the exception will be passed to the parent monitor and delivered as
usual:
# exception Another_exception;;
exception Another_exception
# Deferred.any [ after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.5)
; swallow_some_errors Another_exception ];;

316
Concurrent Programming with Async
Exception:
(monitor.ml.Error (Another_exception) ("Caught by monitor (id 69)")).
If instead we use Ignore_me, the exception will be ignored, and the computation
will nish when the timeout expires.
# Deferred.any [ after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.5)
; swallow_some_errors Ignore_me ];;
ignoring exn
- : unit = ()
In practice, you should rarely use monitors directly, and instead use functions
like try_with and Monitor.protect that are built on top of monitors. One example
of a library that uses monitors directly is Tcp.Server.create, which tracks both
exceptions thrown by the logic that handles the network connection and by the callback
for responding to an individual request, in either case responding to an exception
by closing the connection. It is for building this kind of custom error handling that
monitors can be helpful.
17.4.2
Example: Handling Exceptions with DuckDuckGo
Let's now go back and improve the exception handling of our DuckDuckGo client. In
particular, we'll change it so that any query that fails is reported without preventing
other queries from completing.
The search code as it is fails rarely, so let's make a change that allows us to trigger
failures more predictably. We'll do this by making it possible to distribute the requests
over multiple servers. Then, we'll handle the errors that occur when one of those
servers is misspecied.
First we'll need to change query_uri to take an argument specifying the server to
connect to:
(* Generate a DuckDuckGo search URI from a query string *)
let query_uri ~server query =
let base_uri =
Uri.of_string
(String.concat [ "http://"; server; "/?format=json" ])
in
Uri.add_query_param base_uri ("q", [ query ])
In addition, we'll make the necessary changes to get the list of servers on the
command-line, and to distribute the search queries round-robin across the list of
servers.
Now, let's see what happens when we rebuild the application and run it on two
servers, one of which won't respond to the query.
$ dune exec -- ./search.exe -servers localhost,api.duckduckgo.com
"Concurrent Programming" "OCaml"
(monitor.ml.Error (Unix.Unix_error "Connection refused" connect
127.0.0.1:80)
("Raised by primitive operation at file
\"duniverse/async_unix/src/unix_syscalls.ml\", line 1046,
characters 17-74"

17.4 Example: Handling Exceptions with DuckDuckGo
317
"Called from file \"duniverse/async_kernel/src/deferred1.ml\", line
17, characters 40-45"
"Called from file \"duniverse/async_kernel/src/job_queue.ml\", line
170, characters 6-47"
"Caught by monitor Tcp.close_sock_on_error"))
[1]
As you can see, we got a Connection refused failure, which ends the entire
program, even though one of the two queries would have gone through successfully on
its own. We can handle the failures of individual connections separately by using the
try_with function within each call to get_definition, as follows:
(* Execute the DuckDuckGo search *)
let get_definition ~server word =
match%map
try_with (fun () ->
let%bind _, body =
Cohttp_async.Client.get (query_uri ~server word)
in
let%map string = Cohttp_async.Body.to_string body in
word, get_definition_from_json string)
with
| Ok (word, result) -> word, Ok result
| Error _ -> word, Error "Unexpected failure"
Here, we rst use try_with to capture the exception, and then use match%map
(another syntax provided by ppx_let) to convert the error into the form we want: a
pair whose rst element is the word being searched for, and the second element is the
(possibly erroneous) result.
Now we just need to change the code for print_result so that it can handle the new
type:
(* Print out a word/definition pair *)
let print_result (word, definition) =
printf
"%s\n%s\n\n%s\n\n"
word
(String.init (String.length word) ~f:(fun _ -> '-'))
(match definition with
| Error s -> "DuckDuckGo query failed: " ^ s
| Ok None -> "No definition found"
| Ok (Some def) ->
String.concat ~sep:"\n" (Wrapper.wrap (Wrapper.make 70) def))
Now, if we run that same query, we'll get individualized handling of the connection
failures:
$ dune exec -- ./search.exe -servers localhost,api.duckduckgo.com

Caml language with object-oriented programming constructs."
Now, only the query that went to localhost failed.
Note that in this code, we're relying on the fact that Cohttp_async.Client.get
will clean up after itself after an exception, in particular by closing its le descrip-
tors. If you need to implement such functionality directly, you may want to use the
Monitor.protect call, which is analogous to the protect call described in Chap-
ter 8.2.3 (Cleaning Up in the Presence of Exceptions).
17.5
Timeouts, Cancellation, and Choices
In a concurrent program, one often needs to combine results from multiple, distinct
concurrent subcomputations going on in the same program. We already saw this in our
DuckDuckGo example, where we used Deferred.all and Deferred.all_unit to wait
for a list of deferreds to become determined. Another useful primitive is Deferred.both,
which lets you wait until two deferreds of dierent types have returned, returning both
values as a tuple. Here, we use the function sec, which is shorthand for creating a
time-span equal to a given number of seconds:
# let string_and_float =
Deferred.both
(let%map () = after (sec 0.5) in "A")
(let%map () = after (sec 0.25) in 32.33);;
val string_and_float : (string * float) Deferred.t = <abstr>
# string_and_float;;
- : string * float = ("A", 32.33)
Sometimes, however, we want to wait only for the rst of multiple events to occur.
This happens particularly when dealing with timeouts. In that case, we can use the
call Deferred.any, which, given a list of deferreds, returns a single deferred that will
become determined once any of the values on the list is determined.
# Deferred.any
[ (let%map () = after (sec 0.5) in "half a second")
; (let%map () = after (sec 1.0) in "one second")
; (let%map () = after (sec 4.0) in "four seconds")
];;
- : string = "half a second"
Let's use this to add timeouts to our DuckDuckGo searches. The following code is
a wrapper for get_definition that takes a timeout (in the form of a Time.Span.t) and
returns either the denition, or, if that takes too long, an error:
let get_definition_with_timeout ~server ~timeout word =
Deferred.any
[ (let%map () = after timeout in

17.5 Timeouts, Cancellation, and Choices
319
word, Error "Timed out")
; (match%map get_definition ~server word with
| word, Error _ -> word, Error "Unexpected failure"
| word, (Ok _ as x) -> word, x)
]
We use let%map above to transform the deferred values we're waiting for so that
Deferred.any can choose between values of the same type.
A problem with this code is that the HTTP query kicked o by get_definition is not
actually shut down when the timeout res. As such, get_definition_with_timeout
can leak an open connection. Happily, Cohttp does provide a way of shutting down a
client. You can pass a deferred under the label interrupt to Cohttp_async.Client.get.
Once interrupt is determined, the client connection will be shut down.
The
following
code
shows
how
you
can
change
get_definition
and
get_definition_with_timeout to cancel the get call if the timeout expires:
(* Execute the DuckDuckGo search *)
let get_definition ~server ~interrupt word =
match%map
try_with (fun () ->
let%bind _, body =
Cohttp_async.Client.get ~interrupt (query_uri ~server word)
in
let%map string = Cohttp_async.Body.to_string body in
word, get_definition_from_json string)
with
| Ok (word, result) -> word, Ok result
| Error _ -> word, Error "Unexpected failure"
Next, we'll modify get_definition_with_timeout to create a deferred to pass in
to get_definition, which will become determined when our timeout expires:
let get_definition_with_timeout ~server ~timeout word =
match%map
get_definition ~server ~interrupt:(after timeout) word
with
| word, (Ok _ as x) -> word, x
| word, Error _ -> word, Error "Unexpected failure"
This will cause the connection to shutdown cleanly when we time out; but our code
no longer explicitly knows whether or not the timeout has kicked in. In particular, the
error message on a timeout will now be "Unexpected failure" rather than "Timed
out", which it was in our previous implementation.
We can get more precise handling of timeouts using Async's choose function.
choose lets you pick among a collection of dierent deferreds, reacting to exactly one
of them. Each deferred is paired, using the function choice, with a function that is
called if and only if that deferred is chosen. Here's the type signature of choice and
choose:
# choice;;
- : 'a Deferred.t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b Deferred.choice = <fun>
# choose;;
- : 'a Deferred.choice list -> 'a Deferred.t = <fun>

320
Concurrent Programming with Async
Note that there's no guarantee that the winning deferred will be the one that becomes
determined rst. But choose does guarantee that only one choice will be chosen, and
only the chosen choice will execute the attached function.
In the following example, we use choose to ensure that the interrupt deferred
becomes determined if and only if the timeout deferred is chosen. Here's the code:
let get_definition_with_timeout ~server ~timeout word =
let interrupt = Ivar.create () in
choose
[ choice (after timeout) (fun () ->
Ivar.fill interrupt ();
word, Error "Timed out")
; choice
(get_definition ~server ~interrupt:(Ivar.read interrupt) word)
(fun (word, result) ->
let result' =
match result with
| Ok _ as x -> x
| Error _ -> Error "Unexpected failure"
in
word, result')
]
Now, if we run this with a suitably small timeout, we'll see that one query succeeds
and the other fails reporting a timeout:
$ dune exec -- ./search.exe "concurrent programming" ocaml -timeout

Working with System Threads
Although we haven't worked with them yet, OCaml does have built-in support for
true system threads, i.e., kernel-level threads whose interleaving is controlled by the
operating system. We discussed in the beginning of the chapter the advantages of
Async's cooperative threading model over system threads, but even if you mostly use

17.6 Working with System Threads
321
Async, OCaml's system threads are sometimes necessary, and it's worth understanding
them.
The most surprising aspect of OCaml's system threads is that they don't aord
you any access to physical parallelism. That's because OCaml's runtime has a single
runtime lock that at most one thread can be holding at a time.
Given that threads don't provide physical parallelism, why are they useful at all?
The most common reason for using system threads is that there are some operating
system calls that have no nonblocking alternative, which means that you can't run them
directly in a system like Async without blocking your entire program. For this reason,
Async maintains a thread pool for running such calls. Most of the time, as a user of
Async you don't need to think about this, but it is happening under the covers.
Another reason to have multiple threads is to deal with non-OCaml libraries that
have their own event loop or for another reason need their own threads. In that case,
it's sometimes useful to run some OCaml code on the foreign thread as part of the
communication to your main program. OCaml's foreign function interface is discussed
in more detail in Chapter 23 (Foreign Function Interface).
Multicore OCaml
OCaml doesn't support truly parallel threads today, but it will soon. The current
development branch of OCaml, which is expected to be released in 2022 as OCaml 5.0,
has a long awaited multicore-capable garbage collector, which is the result of years of
research and hard implementation work.
We won't discuss the multicore gc here in part because it's not yet released, and in
part because there's a lot of open questions about how OCaml programs should take
advantage of multicore in a way that's safe, convenient, and performant. Given all that,
we just don't know enough to write a chapter about multicore today.
In any case, while multicore OCaml isn't here yet, it's an exciting part of OCaml's
near-term future.
Another occasional use for system threads is to better interoperate with compute-
intensive OCaml code. In Async, if you have a long-running computation that never
calls bind or map, then that computation will block out the Async runtime until it
completes.
One way of dealing with this is to explicitly break up the calculation into smaller
pieces that are separated by binds. But sometimes this explicit yielding is impractical,
since it may involve intrusive changes to an existing codebase. Another solution is
to run the code in question in a separate thread. Async's In_thread module provides
multiple facilities for doing just this, In_thread.run being the simplest. We can simply
write:
# let def = In_thread.run (fun () -> List.range 1 10);;
val def : int list Deferred.t = <abstr>
# def;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9]
to cause List.range 1 10 to be run on one of Async's worker threads. When the

322
Concurrent Programming with Async
computation is complete, the result is placed in the deferred, where it can be used in
the ordinary way from Async.
Interoperability between Async and system threads can be quite tricky. Consider the
following function for testing how responsive Async is. The function takes a deferred-
returning thunk, and it rst runs that thunk, and then uses Clock.every to wake up
every 100 milliseconds and print out a timestamp, until the returned deferred becomes
determined, at which point it prints out one last timestamp:
# let log_delays thunk =
let start = Time.now () in
let print_time () =
let diff = Time.diff (Time.now ()) start in
printf "%s, " (Time.Span.to_string diff)
in
let d = thunk () in
Clock.every (sec 0.1) ~stop:d print_time;
let%bind () = d in
printf "\nFinished at: ";
print_time ();
printf "\n";
Writer.flushed (force Writer.stdout);;
val log_delays : (unit -> unit Deferred.t) -> unit Deferred.t = <fun>
If we feed this function a simple timeout deferred, it works as you might expect,
waking up roughly every 100 milliseconds:
# log_delays (fun () -> after (sec 0.5));;
37.670135498046875us, 100.65722465515137ms, 201.19547843933105ms,

Finished at: 500.67615509033203ms,
- : unit = ()
Now see what happens if, instead of waiting on a clock event, we wait for a busy
loop to nish running:
# let busy_loop () =
let x = ref None in
for i = 1 to 100_000_000 do x := Some i done;;
val busy_loop : unit -> unit = <fun>
# log_delays (fun () -> return (busy_loop ()));;
Finished at: 874.99594688415527ms,
- : unit = ()
As you can see, instead of waking up 10 times a second, log_delays is blocked out
entirely while busy_loop churns away.
If, on the other hand, we use In_thread.run to ooad this to a dierent system
thread, the behavior will be dierent:
# log_delays (fun () -> In_thread.run busy_loop);;
31.709671020507812us, 107.50102996826172ms, 207.65542984008789ms,

Finished at: 840.72136878967285ms,
- : unit = ()
Now log_delays does get a chance to run, but it's no longer at clean 100 millisecond

17.6 Thread-Safety and Locking
323
intervals. The reason is that now that we're using system threads, we are at the mercy
of the operating system to decide when each thread gets scheduled. The behavior of
threads is very much dependent on the operating system and how it is congured.
Another tricky aspect of dealing with OCaml threads has to do with allocation.
When compiling to native code, OCaml's threads only get a chance to give up the
runtime lock when they interact with the allocator, so if there's a piece of code that
doesn't allocate at all, then it will never allow another OCaml thread to run. Bytecode
doesn't have this behavior, so if we run a nonallocating loop in bytecode, our timer
process will get to run:
# let noalloc_busy_loop () =
for i = 0 to 100_000_000 do () done;;
val noalloc_busy_loop : unit -> unit = <fun>
# log_delays (fun () -> In_thread.run noalloc_busy_loop);;

Finished at: 418.69187355041504ms,
- : unit = ()
But if we compile this to a native-code executable, then the nonallocating busy loop
will block anything else from running:
$ dune exec -- native_code_log_delays.exe
197.41058349609375us,
Finished at: 1.2127914428710938s,
The takeaway from these examples is that predicting thread interleavings is a subtle
business. Staying within the bounds of Async has its limitations, but it leads to more
predictable behavior.
17.6.1
Thread-Safety and Locking
Once you start working with system threads, you'll need to be careful about mutable
data structures. Most mutable OCaml data structures will behave non-deterministically
when accessed concurrently by multiple threads. The issues you can run into range
from runtime exceptions to corrupted data structures. That means you should almost
always use mutexes when sharing mutable data between dierent systems threads. Even
data structures that seem like they should be safe but are mutable under the covers, like
lazy values, can behave in surprising ways when accessed from multiple threads.
There are two commonly available mutex packages for OCaml: the Mutex module
that's part of the standard library, which is just a wrapper over OS-level mutexes and
Nano_mutex, a more ecient alternative that takes advantage of some of the locking
done by the OCaml runtime to avoid needing to create an OS-level mutex much of the
time. As a result, creating a Nano_mutex.t is 20 times faster than creating a Mutex.t,
and acquiring the mutex is about 40 percent faster.
Overall, combining Async and threads is quite tricky, but it's pretty simple if the
following two conditions hold:
• There is no shared mutable state between the various threads involved.

324
Concurrent Programming with Async
• The computations executed by In_thread.run do not make any calls to the Async
library.
That said, you can safely use threads in ways that violate these constraints. In
particular, foreign threads can acquire the Async lock using calls from the Thread_safe
module in Async, and thereby run Async computations safely. This is a very exible
way of connecting threads to the Async world, but it's a complex use case that is beyond
the scope of this chapter.

18
Testing
The goal of this chapter is to teach you how to write eective tests in OCaml, and to
show o some tools that can help. Tooling is especially important in the context of
testing because one of the things that prevents people from doing as much testing as
they should is the tedium of it. But with the right tools in hand, writing tests can be
lightweight and fun.
And that's important, because when testing is fun, you'll do more of it, and thorough
testing is an essential element of building reliable and evolvable software. People
sometimes imagine that tests are less important in a language like OCaml with a rich
and expressive type-system, but in some sense the opposite is true. Really, types help
you get more value out of your testing eort, both because they prevent you from
needing to test all sorts of trivial properties that are automatically enforced by the
type system, and because the rigidity of types mean that your code often has a kind
of snap-together quality, where a relatively small number of tests can do an outsize
amount to ensure that your code is behaving as expected.
Before we start introducing testing tools, it's worth pausing to consider what we
want out of our tests in the rst place.
Ideally, tests should be:
• Easy to write and run. Tests should require a minimum of boilerplate to create and
to hook into your development process. Ideally, you should set things up so that
tests are run automatically on every proposed change, preventing people from
accidentally breaking the build.
• Easy to update. Tests that are hard to adjust in the face of code changes can become
their own form of technical debt.
• Fast, so they don't slow down your development process.
• Deterministic. It's hard to take test failures seriously if there's a decent chance
that the failure is a random glitch. You want your test failures to be believable
indications of a problem, which requires determinism.
• Understandable. Good tests should be easy to read, and their failures should be
localized and specic, so it's easy to nd and x the problem agged by a failing
test.
No testing framework can ensure that your tests satisfy these properties. But the
tools you choose can help or hinder on all these fronts.

326
Testing
As we go through the rest of this chapter and introduce you to some of the available
tooling, you should be able to see how each tool helps advance these goals.
18.1
Inline Tests
The rst step towards a good testing environment is making it easy to set up and run a
test. To that end, we'll show you how to write tests with ppx_inline_test, which lets
you add tests to any module in a library with a specially annotated let binding.
To use inline tests in a library, we need to do two things:
• Tell Dune to expect inline tests to show up in the library, and
• enable ppx_inline_test as a preprocessor.
The rst of these is achieved by adding an (inline_tests) declaration, and the
second is achieved by adding ppx_inline_test to the set of preprocessors. Here's the
resulting dune le.
(library
(name foo)
(libraries base stdio)
(inline_tests)
(preprocess (pps ppx_inline_test)))
With this done, any module in this library can host a test. We'll demonstrate this by
creating a le called test.ml, containing one test.
open Base
let%test "rev" =
List.equal Int.equal (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ]) [ 1; 2; 3 ]
The test passes if the expression on the right-hand side of the equals-sign evaluates
to true. Inline tests are not automatically run with the instantiation of the module, but
are instead registered for running via the test runner.
$ dune runtest
No output is generated because the test passed successfully. But if we break the test,
open Base
let%test "rev" =
List.equal Int.equal (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ]) [ 3; 2; 1 ]
we'll see an error when we run it.
$ dune runtest
File "test.ml", line 3, characters 0-74: rev is false.
FAILED 1 / 1 tests
[1]

18.1 Where Should Tests Go?
327
18.1.1
More Readable Errors with test_eq
One problem with the test output we just saw is that it doesn't show the data associated
with the failed test, thus making it harder to diagnose and x the problem when it
occurs. We can x this if we signal a test failure by throwing an exception, rather than
by returning false. That exception can then be used to report the details of what went
wrong.
To do this, we'll change our test declaration to use let%test_unit instead of
let%test, so that the test no longer expects a body that returns a bool. We're also
going to use the [%test_eq] syntax, which, given a type, generates code to test for
equality and throw a meaningful exception if the arguments are unequal.
To use [%test_eq], we're going to need to add the ppx_assert syntax extension, so
we'll need to adjust our dune le appropriately.
(library
(name foo)
(libraries base stdio)
(preprocess
(pps ppx_inline_test ppx_assert))
(inline_tests))
Here's what our new test looks like.
open Base
let%test_unit "rev" =
[%test_eq: int list] (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ]) [ 3; 2; 1 ]
Now we can run the test to see what the output looks like.
$ dune runtest
File "test.ml", line 3, characters 0-79: rev threw
(duniverse/ppx_assert/runtime-lib/runtime.ml.E "comparison failed"
((1 2 3) vs (3 2 1) (Loc test.ml:4:13))).

"duniverse/ppx_inline_test/runtime-lib/runtime.ml", line 444,

As you can see, the data that caused the comparison to fail is printed out, along with
the stack backtrace. Sadly, the backtrace is in this case mostly a distraction. That's a
downside of using exceptions to report test failures.

328
Testing
18.1.2
Where Should Tests Go?
The inline test framework lets you put tests into any .ml le that's part of a library. But
just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
Putting tests directly in the library you're building certainly has some benets. For
one thing, it lets you put a test for a given function directly after the denition of that
function, which in some cases can be good for readability. This approach also lets you
test aspects of your code that aren't exposed by its external interface.
While this sounds appealing at rst glance, putting tests in libraries has several
downsides.
• Readability. Including all of your tests directly in your application code can make
that code itself harder to read. This can lead to people writing too few tests in an
eort to keep their application code uncluttered.
• Bloat. When your tests are written as a part of your library, it means that every user
of your library has to link in that testing code in their production application. Even
though that code won't be run, it still adds to the size of the executable. It can
also require dependencies on libraries that you don't need in production, which
can reduce the portability of your code.
• Testing mindset. Writing tests on the inside of your libraries lets you write tests
against any part of your implementation, rather than just the exposed API. This
freedom is useful, but can also put you in the wrong testing mindset. Testing
that's phrased in terms of the public API often does a better job of testing
what's fundamental about your code, and will better survive refactoring of the
implementation. Also, the discipline of keeping tests outside of requires you to
write code that can be tested that way, which pushes towards better designs.
For all of these reasons, our recommendation is to put the bulk of your tests in
test-only libraries created for that purpose. There are some legitimate reasons to want
to put some test directly in your production library, e.g., when you need access to some
functionality to do the test that's important but is really awkward to expose. But such
cases are very much the exception.
Why Can't Inline Tests Go in Executables?
We've only talked about putting tests into libraries. What about executables? It turns out
you can't do this directly, because Dune doesn't support the inline_tests declaration
in source les that are directly part of an executable.
There's a good reason for this: the ppx_inline_test test runner needs to instantiate
the modules that contain the tests. If those modules have toplevel side-eects, that's a
recipe for disaster, since you don't want those top-level eects to be triggered by the
test framework.
So, how do we test code that's part of an executable? The solution is to break up
your program into two pieces: a directory containing a library that contains the logic
of your program, but no top-level eects; and a directory for the executable that links
in the library, and is responsible for launching the code.

18.2 Basic Mechanics
329
18.2
Expect Tests
The tests we've shown so far have been mostly about checking some specic properties
in a given scenario. Sometimes, though, what you want is not to test this or that property,
but to capture and make visible your code's behavior. Expect tests let you do just that.
18.2.1
Basic Mechanics
With expect tests, your source le species both the code to be executed and the
expected output. Upon running an expect test, any discrepancy between the expected
output and what was actually generated is reported as a test failure.
Here's a simple example of a test written in this style. While the test generates output
(though a call to print_endline), that output isn't captured in the source, at least, not
yet.
open! Base
open Stdio
let%expect_test "trivial" = print_endline "Hello World!"
open and open!
In this example, we use open! instead of open because we happen not to be using any
values from Base, and so the compiler will warn us about an unused open.
But because Base is eectively our standard library, we want to keep it open anyway,
since we want any new code we write to nd Base's modules rather than those from
the ordinary standard library. The exclamation point at the end of open suppresses that
warning.
A sensible idiom is to always use open! when opening a library like Base, so that
you don't have to choose when to use the !, and when not to.
If we run the test, we'll be presented with a di between what we wrote, and a
corrected version of the source le that now has an [%expect] clause containing the
output. Note that Dune will use the patdiff tool if it's available, which generates
easier-to-read dis. You can install patdiff with opam.
$ dune runtest
patdiff (internal) (exit 1)
(cd _build/default && rwo/_build/install/default/bin/patdiff
-keep-whitespace -location-style omake -ascii test.ml
test.ml.corrected)
------ test.ml
++++++ test.ml.corrected
File "test.ml", line 5, characters 0-1:
|open! Base
|open Stdio
|
|let%expect_test "trivial" =
-|
print_endline "Hello World!"
+|
print_endline "Hello World!";

330
Testing
+|
[%expect {| Hello World! |}]
[1]
The expect test runner also creates a version of the le with the captured output, with
.corrected appended to the end of the lename. If this new output looks correct, we
can promote it by copying the corrected le over the original source. The dune promote
command does just this, leaving our source as follows.
open Base
open Stdio
let%expect_test "trivial" =
print_endline "Hello World!";
[%expect {| Hello World! |}]
Now, if we run the test again, we'll see that it passes.
$ dune runtest
We only have one expect block in this example, but the system supports having
multiple expect blocks:
open Base
open Stdio
let%expect_test "multi-block" =
print_endline "Hello";
[%expect {| Hello |}];
print_endline "World!";
[%expect {| World! |}]
18.2.2
What Are Expect Tests Good For?
It's not obvious why one would want to use expect tests in the rst place. Why should
this:
open Base
open Stdio
let%expect_test _ =
print_s [%sexp (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ] : int list)];
[%expect {| (1 2 3) |}]
be preferable to this:
open Base
let%test "rev" =
List.equal Int.equal (List.rev [ 3; 2; 1 ]) [ 1; 2; 3 ]
Indeed, for examples like this, expect tests aren't better: simple example-based
tests like the one above work ne when it's easy and convenient to write out specic
examples in full. And, as we'll discuss later in the chapter, property tests are your best
bet when you have a clear set of predicates that you want to test, and examples can be
naturally generated at random.

18.2 Exploratory Programming
331
Where expect tests shine is where you want to make visible some aspect of the
behavior of your system that's hard to capture in a predicate. This is more useful than
it might seem at rst. Let's consider a few dierent example use-cases to see why.
18.2.3
Exploratory Programming
Expect tests can be especially helpful when you're in exploration mode, where you're
trying to solve a problem by playing around with the data, and have no clear specica-
tion in advance.
A common programming task of this type is web-scraping, where the goal is
generally to extract some useful information from a web page. Figuring out the right
way to do so often involves trial and error.
Here's some code that does this kind of data extraction, using the lambdasoup
package to traverse a chunk of HTML and spit out some data embedded within it. In
particular, the function aims to produce the set of hosts that show up in links within a
document.
open Base
open Stdio
let get_href_hosts soup =
Soup.select "a[href]" soup
|> Soup.to_list
|> List.map ~f:(Soup.R.attribute "href")
|> Set.of_list (module String)
We can use an expect test to demonstrate what this function does on an example
page.
let%expect_test _ =
let example_html =
{|
<html>
Some random <b>text</b> with a
<a href="http://ocaml.org/base">link</a>.
And here's another
<a href="http://github.com/ocaml/dune">link</a>.
And here is <a>link</a> with no href.
</html>|}
in
let soup = Soup.parse example_html in
let hrefs = get_href_hosts soup in
print_s [%sexp (hrefs : Set.M(String).t)]
Quoted Strings
The example above used a new syntax for string literals, called quoted strings. Here's
an example.
# {|This is a quoted string|};;
- : string = "This is a quoted string"

332
Testing
The advantage of this syntax is that it allows the content to be written without the
usual escaping required for ordinary string literals. Consider the following examples.
# {|This is a literal quote: "|};;
((:- : string = "This is a literal quote: \""::)
As you can see, we didn't need to escape the included quote, though the version of
the string echoed back by the toplevel uses ordinary string literal syntax, and so the
quote there comes out escaped.
Quoted strings are especially useful when writing strings containing text from
another language, like HTML. With quoted strings, you can just paste in a snippet of
some other source language, and it should work unmodied.
The one tricky corner is if you need to include a literal |} inside your quoted string.
The trick is that you can change the delimiter for the quoted string by adding an arbitrary
identier, thereby ensuring that the delimiter won't show up in the body of the string.
# {xxx|This is how you quote a {|quoted string|}|xxx};;
- : string = "This is how you quote a {|quoted string|}"
If we run the test, we'll see that the output isn't exactly what was intended.

The problem here is that we failed to extract the host from the URI string. I.e., we
ended up with http://github.com/ocaml/dune instead of github.com. We can x that
by using the uri library to parse the string and extract the host. Here's the modied
code.

One nice aspect of this exploratory workow is that once you've gotten things
working, you can leave the examples you used to develop the code as permanent tests.
18.2.4
Visualizing Complex Behavior
Expect tests can be used to examine the dynamic behavior of a system. Let's walk
through a simple example: a rate limiter. The job of a rate limiter is to bound the rate at
which a system consumes a particular resource. The following is the mli for a library
that species the logic of a simple rolling-window-style rate limiter, where the intent
is to make sure that there's no window of time of the specied period during which
more than a specied number of events occurs.
open Core
type t
val create : now:Time_ns.t -> period:Time_ns.Span.t -> rate:int -> t
val maybe_consume : t -> now:Time_ns.t -> [ `Consumed | `No_capacity ]

334
Testing
We can demonstrate the behavior of the system by running through some examples.
First, we'll write some helper functions to make the examples shorter and easier to
read.
open Core
let start_time = Time_ns.of_string "2021-06-01 7:00:00"
let limiter () =

let consume lim offset =
let result =
Rate_limiter.maybe_consume

in
printf
"%4.2f: %s\n"
offset
(match result with
| `Consumed -> "C"
| `No_capacity -> "N")
Here, we dene three values: start_time, which is just a point in time at which to
begin our examples; limiter, which is a function for constructing a fresh Limiter.t
object, with some reasonable defaults; and consume, which attempts to consume a
resource.
Notably, consume doesn't just update the limiter, it also prints out a marker of the
result, i.e., whether the consumption succeeded or failed.
Now we can use these helpers to see how the rate limiter would behave in a simple
scenario. First, we're going to try to consume three times at time zero; then we're going
to wait a half-second and consume again, and then we'll wait one more half-second,
and try again.
let%expect_test _ =
let lim = limiter () in
let consume offset = consume lim offset in
(* Exhaust the rate limit, without advancing the clock. *)
for _ = 1 to 3 do
consume 0.
done;
[%expect {| |}];
(* Wait until a half-second has elapsed, try again *)
consume 0.5;
[%expect {| |}];
(* Wait until a full second has elapsed, try again *)
consume 1.;
[%expect {|
|}]
Running the tests and accepting the promotions will include the execution trace.

18.2 Visualizing Complex Behavior
335
let%expect_test _ =
let lim = limiter () in
let consume offset = consume lim offset in
(* Exhaust the rate limit, without advancing the clock. *)
for _ = 1 to 3 do
consume 0.
done;
[%expect {|
0.00: C
0.00: C
0.00: C |}];
(* Wait until a half-second has elapsed, try again *)
consume 0.5;
[%expect {| 0.50: C |}];
(* Wait until a full second has elapsed, try again *)
consume 1.;
[%expect {| 1.00: C |}]
The above, however, is not the expected outcome! In particular, all of our calls to
consume succeeded, despite us violating the 2-per-second rate limit. That's because
there was a bug in our implementation. The implementation has a queue of times
where consume events occurred, and we use this function to drain the queue.
let rec drain_old_events t =
match Queue.peek t.events with
| None -> ()
| Some time ->
if Time_ns.Span.( < ) (Time_ns.diff t.now time) t.period
then (
ignore (Queue.dequeue_exn t.events : Time_ns.t);
drain_old_events t)
But the comparison goes the wrong way: we should discard events that are older
than the limit-period, not younger. If we x that, we'll see that the trace behaves as
we'd expect.
let%expect_test _ =
let lim = limiter () in
let consume offset = consume lim offset in
(* Exhaust the rate limit, without advancing the clock. *)
for _ = 1 to 3 do
consume 0.
done;
[%expect {|
0.00: C
0.00: C
0.00: N |}];
(* Wait until a half-second has elapsed, try again *)
consume 0.5;
[%expect {| 0.50: N |}];
(* Wait until a full second has elapsed, try again *)
consume 1.;
[%expect {| 1.00: C |}]
One of the things that makes this test readable is that we went to some trouble to
keep the code short and easy to read. Some of this was about creating useful helper

336
Testing
functions, and some of it was about having a concise and noise-free format for the data
captured by the expect blocks.
18.2.5
End-to-End Tests
The expect tests we've seen so far have been self-contained, not doing any IO or
interacting with system resources. As a result, these tests are fast to run and entirely
deterministic.
That's a great ideal, but it's not always achievable, especially when you want to run
more end-to-end tests of your program. But even if you need to run tests that involve
multiple processes interacting with each other and using real IO, expect tests are still
a useful tool.
To see how such tests can be built, we'll write some tests for the echo server we
developed in Chapter 17.2 (Example: An Echo Server).
We'll start by creating a new test directory with a dune le next to our echo-server
implementation.
(library
(name echo_test)
(libraries core async)
(preprocess (pps ppx_jane))
(inline_tests (deps ../bin/echo.exe)))
The important line is the last one, where in the inline_tests declaration, we
declare a dependency on the echo-server binary. Also, note that rather than select
useful preprocessors one by one, we used the omnibus ppx_jane package, which
bundles together a collection of useful extensions.
That done, our next step is to write some helper functions. We won't show the
implementation, but here's the signature for our Helpers module. Note that there's an
argument in the launch function that lets you enable the feature in the echo server that
causes it to uppercase the text it receives.
open! Core
open Async
(** Launches the echo server *)
val launch : port:int -> uppercase:bool -> Process.t Deferred.t
(** Connects to the echo server, returning a reader and writer for
communicating with the server. *)
val connect : port:int -> (Reader.t * Writer.t) Deferred.t
(** Sends data to the server, printing out the result
*)
val send_data : Reader.t -> Writer.t -> string -> unit Deferred.t
(** Kills the echo server, and waits until it exits
*)
val cleanup : Process.t -> unit Deferred.t
With the above, we can now write a test that launches the server, connects to it over
TCP, and then sends some data and displays the results.

Note that we put in some expect annotations where we want to see data, but we
haven't lled them in. We can now run the test to see what happens. The results,
however, are not what you might hope for.

What went wrong here? The issue is that the connect fails, because at the time of
the connection, the echo server hasn't nished setting up the server. We can x this by
adding a one second delay before connecting, using Async's Clock.after. With this
change, the test now passes, with the expected results.

return ())
~finally:(fun () -> cleanup process)
We xed the problem, but the solution should make you uncomfortable. For one
thing, why is one second the right timeout, rather than a half a second, or ten? The time
we wait is some balance between reducing the likelihood of a non-deterministic failure
versus preserving performance of the test, which is a bit of an awkward trade-o to
have to make.
We can improve on this by removing the Clock.after call, and instead adding a
retry loop to the connect test helper
let rec connect ~port =
match%bind
Monitor.try_with (fun () ->
Tcp.connect
(Tcp.Where_to_connect.of_host_and_port
{ host = "localhost"; port }))
with
| Ok (_, r, w) -> return (r, w)
| Error _ ->
let%bind () = Clock.after (Time.Span.of_sec 0.01) in
connect ~port
There's still a timeout in this code, in that we wait a bit before retrying. But that
timeout is quite aggressive, so you never waste more than 10 milliseconds waiting
unnecessarily. That means tests will typically run fast, but if they do run slowly (maybe
because your machine is heavily loaded during a big build), the test will still pass.

18.3 Property Testing with Quickcheck
339
The lesson here is that keeping tests deterministic in the context of running programs
doing real I/O gets messy fast. When possible, you should write your code in a way
that allows most of it to be tested without having to connect to real running servers.
But when you do need to do it, you can still use expect tests for this purpose.
18.2.6
How to Make a Good Expect Test
Taken together, these examples suggest some guidelines for building good expect tests:
• Write helper functions to help you set up your test scenarios more concisely.
• Write custom pretty-printers that surface just the information that you need to see
in the test. This makes your tests easier to read, and also minimizes unnecessary
churn when details that are irrelevant to your test change.
• Aim for determinism, ideally by organizing your code so you can put it through
its paces without directly interacting with the outside world, which is generally
the source of non-determinism. But if you must, be careful to avoid timeouts and
other stopgaps that will fall apart under performance pressure.
18.3
Property Testing with Quickcheck
Many tests amount to little more than individual examples decorated with simple
assertions to check this or that property. Property testing is a useful extension of this
approach, which lets you explore a much larger portion of your code's behavior with
only a small amount of programmer eort.
The basic idea is simple enough. A property test requires two things: a function that
takes an example input and checks that a given property holds on that example; and a
way of generating random examples. The test then checks whether the predicate holds
over many randomly generated examples.
We can write a property test using only the tools we've learned so far. In this example,
we'll check an obvious-seeming invariant connecting three operations:
• Int.sign, which computes a Sign.t representing the sign of an integer, either
Positive, Negative, or Zero
• Int.neg, which negates a number
• Sign.flip, which ips a Sign.t, i.e., mapping Positive to Negative and vice versa.
The invariant we want to check is that the sign of the negation of any integer x is the
ip of the sign of x.
Here's a simple implementation of this test.
open Base
let%test_unit "negation flips the sign" =
for _ = 0 to 100_000 do
let x = Random.int_incl Int.min_value Int.max_value in
[%test_eq: Sign.t]

340
Testing
(Int.sign (Int.neg x))
(Sign.flip (Int.sign x))
done
As you might expect, the test passes.
$ dune runtest
One choice we had to make in our implementation is which probability distribution
to use for selecting examples. This may not seem like an important question, but it is.
When it comes to testing, not all probability distributions are created equal.
Indeed, the choice we made, which was to pick integers uniformly and at random
from the full set of integers, is problematic, since it picks interesting special cases,
like zero and one, with the same probability as everything else. Given the number of
integers, the chance of testing any of those special cases is rather low, which seems
like a problem.
This is a place where Quickcheck can help. Quickcheck is a library to help automate
the construction of testing distributions. Let's try rewriting the above example using it.
Note that we open Core here because Core has nicely integrated support for Quickcheck,
with helper functions already integrated into most common modules. There's also a
standalone Base_quickcheck library that can be used without Core.
open Core
let%test_unit "negation flips the sign" =
Quickcheck.test
~sexp_of:[%sexp_of: int]
(Int.gen_incl Int.min_value Int.max_value)
~f:(fun x ->
[%test_eq: Sign.t]
(Int.sign (Int.neg x))
(Sign.flip (Int.sign x)))
Note that we didn't explicitly state how many examples should be tested. Quickcheck
has a built-in default which can be overridden by way of an optional argument.
Running the test uncovers the fact that the property we've been testing doesn't
actually hold on all outputs, as you can see below.

The example that triggers the exception is -4611686018427387904, also known
as Int.min_value, which is the smallest value of type Int.t. This uncovers some-
thing about integers which may not have been obvious, which is that the largest int,
Int.max_value, is smaller in absolute value than Int.max_value.
# Int.min_value;;
- : int = -4611686018427387904
# Int.max_value;;
- : int = 4611686018427387903
That means there's no natural choice for the negation of min_value. It turns out that
the standard behavior here (not just for OCaml) is for the negation of min_value to be
equal to itself.
# Int.neg Int.min_value;;
- : int = -4611686018427387904
Quickcheck's decision to put much larger weight on special cases is what allowed
us to discover this unexpected behavior. Note that in this case, it's not really a bug that
we've uncovered, it's just that the property that we thought would hold can't in practice.
But either way, Quickcheck helped us understand the behavior of our code better.
18.3.1
Handling Complex Types
Tests can't subsist on simple atomic types alone, which is why you'll often want to build
probability distributions over more complex types. Here's a simple example, where
we want to test the behavior of List.rev_append. For this test, we're going to use a
probability distribution for generating pairs of lists of integers. The following example
shows how that can be done using Quickcheck's combinators.
open Core
let gen_int_list_pair =
let int_list_gen =
List.gen_non_empty (Int.gen_incl Int.min_value Int.max_value)
in
Quickcheck.Generator.both int_list_gen int_list_gen
let%test_unit "List.rev_append is List.append of List.rev" =
Quickcheck.test
~sexp_of:[%sexp_of: int list * int list]
gen_int_list_pair

342
Testing
~f:(fun (l1, l2) ->
[%test_eq: int list]
(List.rev_append l1 l2)
(List.append (List.rev l1) l2))
Here, we made use of Quickcheck.Generator.both, which is useful for creating a
generator for pairs from two generators for the constituent types.
# open Core;;
# #show Quickcheck.Generator.both;;
val both :
'a Base_quickcheck.Generator.t ->
'b Base_quickcheck.Generator.t -> ('a * 'b)
Base_quickcheck.Generator.t
The declaration of the generator is pretty simple, but it's also tedious. Happily,
Quickcheck ships with a PPX that can automate creation of the generator given just
the type declaration. We can use that to simplify our code, as shown below.
open Core
let%test_unit "List.rev_append is List.append of List.rev" =
Quickcheck.test
~sexp_of:[%sexp_of: int list * int list]
[%quickcheck.generator: int list * int list]
~f:(fun (l1, l2) ->
[%test_eq: int list]
(List.rev_append l1 l2)
(List.append (List.rev l1) l2))
This also works with other, more complex data-types, like variants. Here's a simple
example.
type shape =
| Circle of { radius: float }
| Rect of { height: float; width: float }
| Poly of (float * float) list
[@@deriving quickcheck];;
This will make a bunch of reasonable default decisions, like picking Circle, Rect,
and Poly with equal probability. We can use annotations to adjust this, for example, by
specifying the weight on a particular variant.
type shape =
| Circle of { radius: float } [@quickcheck.weight 0.5]
| Rect of { height: float; width: float }
| Poly of (float * float) list
[@@deriving quickcheck];;
Note that the default weight on each case is 1, so now Circle will be generated
with probability 0.5 / 2.5 or 0.2, instead of the 1/3rd probability that it would have
natively.
18.3.2
More Control with Let-Syntax
If the annotations associated with ppx_quickcheck don't let you do precisely what
you want, you can get more control by taking advantage of the fact that Quickcheck's

18.4 Other Tools to Do (Mostly) the Same Things
343
generators form a monad. That means it supports operators like bind and map, which
we rst presented in an error handling context in Chapter 8.1.3 (bind and Other Error
Handling Idioms).
In combination with let syntax, the generator monad gives us a convenient way to
specify generators for custom types. Here's an example generator for the shape type
above.
# let gen_shape =
let open Quickcheck.Generator.Let_syntax in
let module G = Base_quickcheck.Generator in
let circle =
let%map radius = G.float_positive_or_zero in
Circle { radius }
in
let rect =
let%bind height = G.float_positive_or_zero in
let%map width = G.float_inclusive height Float.infinity in
Rect { height; width }
in
let poly =
let%map points =
List.gen_non_empty
(G.both G.float_positive_or_zero G.float_positive_or_zero)
in
Poly points
in
G.union [ circle; rect; poly ];;
val gen_shape : shape Base_quickcheck.Generator.t = <abstr>
Throughout this function we're making choices about the probability distribution.
For example, the use of the union operator means that circles, rectangles and polygons
will be equally likely. We could have used weighted_union to pick a dierent distribu-
tion. Also, we've ensured that all oat values are non-negative, and that the width of
the rectangle is no smaller than its height.
The full API for building generators is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it's
worth digging into the API docs if you want more control over the distribution of your
test examples.
18.4
Other Testing Tools
The testing tools we've described in this chapter cover a lot of ground, but there are
other tools worth knowing about.
18.4.1
Other Tools to Do (Mostly) the Same Things
Here are some notable tools that do more or less the same things as the testing tools
we've featured in this chapter.

344
Testing
• Alcotest1, which is another system for registering and running tests.
• qcheck2, an alternative implementation of quickcheck.
• Dune's cram tests3, which are expect-like tests that are written in a shell-like syntax.
These are great for testing command-line utilities, and are inspired by Mercurial's
testing framework.
Which of these you might end up preferring is to some degree a matter of taste.
18.4.2
Fuzzing
There's one other kind of testing tool that we haven't covered in this chapter, but is
worth knowing about: instrumentation-guided fuzzing. You can think of this as another
take on property testing, with a very dierent approach to generating random examples.
Traditional fuzzing just throws randomly mutated data at a program, and looks for
some indication of failure, often simply the program crashing with a segfault. This kind
of fuzzing has been surprisingly eective at nding bugs, especially security bugs, in
production software. But blind randomization is still quite limited in terms of how
much program behavior it can eectively explore.
Instrumentation-guided fuzzing improves on this by instrumenting the program, and
then using that instrumentation to guide the randomization in the direction of more
code coverage. By far the most successful tool in this space is American Fuzzy Lop4,
or AFL, and OCaml has support for the necessary instrumentation.
AFL can have eerily good results, and can with no guidance do things like construct-
ing nearly-parseable text when fuzzing a parser, just by iteratively randomizing inputs
in the direction of more coverage of the program being exercised.
If you're interested in AFL, there are some related tools worth knowing about.
• Crowbar5 is a quickcheck-style library for writing down properties to be tested by
AFL.
• Bun6 is a library for integrating AFL into your continuous-integration pipeline.

Handling JSON Data
Data serialization, i.e., converting data to and from a sequence of bytes that's suitable
for writing to disk or sending across the network, is an important and common pro-
gramming task. You often have to match someone else's data format (such as XML),
sometimes you need a highly ecient format, and other times you want something that
is easy for humans to edit. To this end, OCaml libraries provide several techniques for
data serialization depending on what your problem is.
We'll start by using the popular and simple JSON data format and then look at other
serialization formats later in the book. This chapter introduces you to a couple of new
techniques that glue together the basic ideas from Part I of the book by using:
• Polymorphic variants to write more extensible libraries and protocols (but still retain
the ability to extend them if needed)
• Functional combinators to compose common operations over data structures in a
type-safe way
• External tools to generate boilerplate OCaml modules and signatures from external
specication les
19.1
JSON Basics
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format often used in web services and browsers.
It's described in RFC46271 and is easier to parse and generate than alternatives such
as XML. You'll run into JSON very often when working with modern web APIs, so
we'll cover several dierent ways to manipulate it in this chapter.
JSON consists of two basic structures: an unordered collection of key/value pairs,
and an ordered list of values. Values can be strings, Booleans, oats, integers, or null.
Let's see what a JSON record for an example book description looks like:
{
"title": "Real World OCaml",
"tags" : [ "functional programming", "ocaml", "algorithms" ],
"pages": 450,
"authors": [
{ "name": "Jason Hickey", "affiliation": "Google" },
{ "name": "Anil Madhavapeddy", "affiliation": "Cambridge"},
1 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt

346
Handling JSON Data
{ "name": "Yaron Minsky", "affiliation": "Jane Street"}
],
"is_online": true
}
The outermost JSON value is usually a record (delimited by the curly braces) and
contains an unordered set of key/value pairs. The keys must be strings, but values can
be any JSON type. In the preceding example, tags is a string list, while the authors
eld contains a list of records. Unlike OCaml lists, JSON lists can contain multiple
dierent JSON types within a single list.
This free-form nature of JSON types is both a blessing and a curse. It's very easy to
generate JSON values, but code that parses them also has to handle subtle variations
in how the values are represented. For example, what if the preceding pages value is
actually represented as a string value of 450 instead of an integer?
Our rst task is to parse the JSON into a more structured OCaml type so that we
can use static typing more eectively. When manipulating JSON in Python or Ruby,
you might write unit tests to check that you have handled unusual inputs. The OCaml
model prefers compile-time static checking as well as unit tests. For example, using
pattern matching can warn you if you've not checked that a value can be Null as well
as contain an actual value.
Installing the Yojson Library
There are several JSON libraries available for OCaml. For this chapter, we've picked
the popular Yojson library, which you can install by running opam install yojson.
Once installed, you can open it in utop as follows:
# open Core;;
# #require "yojson";;
# open Yojson;;
19.2
Parsing JSON with Yojson
The JSON specication has very few data types, and the Yojson.Basic.t type that
follows is sucient to express any valid JSON structure:
type json = [
| `Assoc of (string * json) list
| `Bool of bool
| `Float of float
| `Int of int
| `List of json list
| `Null
| `String of string
]
Some interesting properties should leap out at you after reading this denition:
• The json type is recursive, which is to say that some of the tags refer back to the

19.2 Parsing JSON with Yojson
347
overall json type. In particular, Assoc and List types can contain references to
further JSON values of dierent types. This is unlike the OCaml lists, whose
contents must be of a uniform type.
• The denition specically includes a Null variant for empty elds. OCaml doesn't
allow null values by default, so this must be encoded explicitly.
• The type denition uses polymorphic variants and not normal variants. This will
become signicant later, when we extend it with custom extensions to the JSON
format.
Let's parse the earlier JSON example into this type now. The rst stop is the
Yojson.Basic documentation, where we nd these helpful functions:
val from_string : ?buf:Bi_outbuf.t -> ?fname:string -> ?lnum:int ->
string -> json
(* Read a JSON value from a string.
[buf]
: use this buffer at will during parsing instead of
creating a new one.
[fname] : data file name to be used in error messages. It does not
have to be a real file.
[lnum]
: number of the first line of input. Default is 1. *)
val from_file : ?buf:Bi_outbuf.t -> ?fname:string -> ?lnum:int ->
string -> json
(* Read a JSON value from a file. See [from_string] for the meaning
of the optional
arguments. *)
val from_channel : ?buf:Bi_outbuf.t -> ?fname:string -> ?lnum:int ->
in_channel -> json
(** Read a JSON value from a channel.
See [from_string] for the meaning of the optional arguments. *)
When rst reading these interfaces, you can generally ignore the optional arguments
(which have the question marks in the type signature), since they should have sensible
defaults. In the preceding signature, the optional arguments oer ner control over the
memory buer allocation and error messages from parsing incorrect JSON.
The type signature for these functions with the optional elements removed makes
their purpose much clearer. The three ways of parsing JSON are either directly from a
string, from a le on a lesystem, or via a buered input channel:
val from_string
: string
-> json
val from_file
: string
-> json
val from_channel : in_channel -> json
The next example shows both the string and file functions in action, assuming
the JSON record is stored in a le called book.json:
open Core
let () =
(* Read JSON file into an OCaml string *)
let buf = In_channel.read_all "book.json" in
(* Use the string JSON constructor *)
let json1 = Yojson.Basic.from_string buf in

348
Handling JSON Data
(* Use the file JSON constructor *)
let json2 = Yojson.Basic.from_file "book.json" in
(* Test that the two values are the same *)
print_endline (if Yojson.Basic.equal json1 json2 then "OK" else
"FAIL")
You can build this by running dune:
$ dune exec -- ./read_json.exe
OK
The from_file function accepts an input lename and takes care of opening and
closing it for you. It's far more common to use from_string to construct JSON values
though, since these strings come in via a network connection (we'll see more of this
in Chapter 17 (Concurrent Programming with Async)) or a database. Finally, the
example checks that the two input mechanisms actually resulted in the same OCaml
data structure.
19.3
Selecting Values from JSON Structures
Now that we've gured out how to parse the example JSON into an OCaml value, let's
manipulate it from OCaml code and extract specic elds:
open Core
let () =
(* Read the JSON file *)
let json = Yojson.Basic.from_file "book.json" in
(* Locally open the JSON manipulation functions *)
let open Yojson.Basic.Util in
let title = json |> member "title" |> to_string in
let tags = json |> member "tags" |> to_list |> filter_string in
let pages = json |> member "pages" |> to_int in
let is_online = json |> member "is_online" |> to_bool_option in
let is_translated = json |> member "is_translated" |>
to_bool_option in
let authors = json |> member "authors" |> to_list in
let names = List.map authors ~f:(fun json -> member "name" json |>
to_string) in
(* Print the results of the parsing *)
printf "Title: %s (%d)\n" title pages;
printf "Authors: %s\n" (String.concat ~sep:", " names);
printf "Tags: %s\n" (String.concat ~sep:", " tags);
let string_of_bool_option =
function
| None -> "<unknown>"
| Some true -> "yes"
| Some false -> "no" in
printf "Online: %s\n" (string_of_bool_option is_online);
printf "Translated: %s\n" (string_of_bool_option is_translated)
Now build and run this in the same way as the previous example:

Title: Real World OCaml (450)
Authors: Jason Hickey, Anil Madhavapeddy, Yaron Minsky

Online: yes
Translated: <unknown>
This code introduces the Yojson.Basic.Util module, which contains combinator
functions that let you easily map a JSON object into a more strongly typed OCaml
value.
Functional Combinators
Combinators are a design pattern that crops up quite often in functional programming.
John Hughes denes them as a function which builds program fragments from pro-
gram fragments. In a functional language, this generally means higher-order functions
that combine other functions to apply useful transformations over values.
You've already run across several of these in the List module:
val map
: 'a list -> f:('a -> 'b)
-> 'b list
val fold : 'a list -> init:'accum -> f:('accum -> 'a -> 'accum) ->
'accum
map and fold are extremely common combinators that transform an input list by
applying a function to each value of the list. The map combinator is simplest, with the
resulting list being output directly. fold applies each value in the input list to a function
that accumulates a single result, and returns that instead:
val iter : 'a list -> f:('a -> unit) -> unit
iter is a more specialized combinator that is only useful when writing imperative
code. The input function is applied to every value, but no result is supplied. The
function must instead apply some side eect such as changing a mutable record eld
or printing to the standard output.
Yojson provides several combinators in the Yojson.Basic.Util module to manipu-
late values:
• val member : string -> json -> json selects a named eld from a JSON record.
• val to_string : json -> string converts a JSON value into an OCaml string.
It raises an exception if this is impossible.
• val to_int : json -> int converts a JSON value into an int. It raises an exception
if this is impossible.
• val filter_string : json list -> string list lters valid strings from a list
of JSON elds, and return them as an OCaml string list.
We'll go through each of these uses one by one now. The following examples also use

350
Handling JSON Data
the |> pipe-forward operator that we explained in Chapter 3 (Variables and Functions).
This lets us chain together multiple JSON selection functions and feed the output from
one into the next one, without having to create separate let bindings for each one.
Let's start with selecting a single title eld from the record:
# open Yojson.Basic.Util;;
# let title = json |> member "title" |> to_string;;
val title : string = "Real World OCaml"
The member function accepts a JSON object and named key and returns the JSON
eld associated with that key, or Null. Since we know that the title value is always
a string in our example schema, we want to convert it to an OCaml string. The
to_string function performs this conversion and raises an exception if there is an
unexpected JSON type. The |> operator provides a convenient way to chain these
operations together:
# let tags = json |> member "tags" |> to_list |> filter_string;;
val tags : string list = ["functional programming"; "ocaml";
"algorithms"]
# let pages = json |> member "pages" |> to_int;;
val pages : int = 450
The tags eld is similar to title, but the eld is a list of strings instead of a single
one. Converting this to an OCaml string list is a two-stage process. First, we convert
the JSON List to an OCaml list of JSON values and then lter out the String values
as an OCaml string list. Remember that OCaml lists must contain values of the
same type, so any JSON values that cannot be converted to a string will be skipped
from the output of filter_string:
# let is_online = json |> member "is_online" |> to_bool_option;;
val is_online : bool option = Some true
# let is_translated = json |> member "is_translated" |>
to_bool_option;;
val is_translated : bool option = None
The is_online and is_translated elds are optional in our JSON schema, so
no error should be raised if they are not present. The OCaml type is a bool option
to reect this and can be extracted via to_bool_option. In our example JSON, only
is_online is present and is_translated will be None:
# let authors = json |> member "authors" |> to_list;;
val authors : Yojson.Basic.t list =
[`Assoc
[("name", `String "Jason Hickey"); ("affiliation", `String
"Google")];
`Assoc
[("name", `String "Anil Madhavapeddy");
("affiliation", `String "Cambridge")];
`Assoc
[("name", `String "Yaron Minsky");
("affiliation", `String "Jane Street")]]
The nal use of JSON combinators is to extract all the name elds from the list of
authors. We rst construct the author list, and then map it into a string list. Notice

19.4 Constructing JSON Values
351
that the example explicitly binds authors to a variable name. It can also be written
more succinctly using the pipe-forward operator:
# let names =
json |> member "authors" |> to_list
|> List.map ~f:(fun json -> member "name" json |> to_string);;
val names : string list =
["Jason Hickey"; "Anil Madhavapeddy"; "Yaron Minsky"]
This style of programming, which omits variable names and chains functions to-
gether, is known as point-free programming. It's a succinct style but shouldn't be
overused due to the increased diculty of debugging intermediate values. If an ex-
plicit name is assigned to each stage of the transformations, debuggers in particular
have an easier time making the program ow simpler to represent to the programmer.
This technique of using statically typed parsing functions is very powerful in com-
bination with the OCaml type system. Many errors that don't make sense at runtime
(for example, mixing up lists and objects) will be caught statically via a type error.
19.4
Constructing JSON Values
Building and printing JSON values is pretty straightforward given the Yojson.Basic.t
type. You can just construct values of type t and call the to_string function on them.
Let's remind ourselves of the Yojson.Basic.t type again:
type json = [
| `Assoc of (string * json) list
| `Bool of bool
| `Float of float
| `Int of int
| `List of json list
| `Null
| `String of string
]
We can directly build a JSON value against this type and use the pretty-printing
functions in the Yojson.Basic module to display JSON output:
# let person = `Assoc [ ("name", `String "Anil") ];;
val person : [> `Assoc of (string * [> `String of string ]) list ] =
`Assoc [("name", `String "Anil")]
In the preceding example, we've constructed a simple JSON object that represents
a single person. We haven't actually dened the type of person explicitly, as we're
relying on the magic of polymorphic variants to make this all work.
The OCaml type system infers a type for person based on how you construct its
value. In this case, only the Assoc and String variants are used to dene the record, and
so the inferred type only contains these elds without knowledge of the other possible
allowed variants in JSON records that you haven't used yet (e.g. Int or Null):
# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_string;;
- : ?std:bool -> Yojson.Basic.t -> string = <fun>

352
Handling JSON Data
The pretty_to_string function has a more explicit signature that requires an
argument of type Yojson.Basic.t. When person is applied to pretty_to_string, the
inferred type of person is statically checked against the structure of the json type to
ensure that they're compatible:
# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_string person;;
- : string = "{ \"name\": \"Anil\" }"
# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_channel stdout person;;
{ "name": "Anil" }
- : unit = ()
In this case, there are no problems. Our person value has an inferred type that is
a valid subtype of json, and so the conversion to a string just works without us ever
having to explicitly specify a type for person. Type inference lets you write more
succinct code without sacricing runtime reliability, as all the uses of polymorphic
variants are still checked at compile time.
Polymorphic Variants and Easier Type Checking
One diculty you will encounter is that type errors involving polymorphic variants
can be quite verbose. For example, suppose you build an Assoc and mistakenly include
a single value instead of a list of keys:
# let person = `Assoc ("name", `String "Anil");;
val person : [> `Assoc of string * [> `String of string ] ] =
`Assoc ("name", `String "Anil")
# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_string person;;
Line 1, characters 31-37:
Error: This expression has type
[> `Assoc of string * [> `String of string ] ]
but an expression was expected of type Yojson.Basic.t
Types for tag `Assoc are incompatible
The type error is more verbose than it needs to be, which can be inconvenient to
wade through for larger values. You can help the compiler to narrow down this error
to a shorter form by adding explicit type annotations as a hint about your intentions:
# let (person : Yojson.Basic.t) =
`Assoc ("name", `String "Anil");;
Line 2, characters 10-34:
Error: This expression has type 'a * 'b
but an expression was expected of type (string *
Yojson.Basic.t) list
We've annotated person as being of type Yojson.Basic.t, and as a result, the
compiler spots that the argument to the Assoc variant has the incorrect type. This
illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of polymorphic variants: they're lightweight
and exible, but the error messages can be quite confusing. However, a bit of careful
manual type annotation makes tracking down such issues much easier.
We'll discuss more techniques like this that help you interpret type errors more
easily in Chapter 26 (The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking).

19.5 Using Nonstandard JSON Extensions
353
19.5
Using Nonstandard JSON Extensions
The standard JSON types are really basic, and OCaml types are far more expressive.
Yojson supports an extended JSON format for those times when you're not interoper-
ating with external systems and just want a convenient human-readable, local format.
The Yojson.Safe.json type is a superset of the Basic polymorphic variant and looks
like this:
type json = [
| `Assoc of (string * json) list
| `Bool of bool
| `Float of float
| `Floatlit of string
| `Int of int
| `Intlit of string
| `List of json list
| `Null
| `String of string
| `Stringlit of string
| `Tuple of json list
| `Variant of string * json option
]
The Safe.json type includes all of the variants from Basic.json and extends it
with a few more useful ones. A standard JSON type such as a String will type-check
against both the Basic module and also the nonstandard Safe module. If you use the
extended values with the Basic module, however, the compiler will reject your code
until you make it compliant with the portable subset of JSON.
Yojson supports the following JSON extensions:
The lit sux Denotes that the value is stored as a JSON string. For example, a
Floatlit will be stored as "1.234" instead of 1.234.
The Tuple type Stored as ("abc", 123) instead of a list.
The Variant type Encodes
OCaml
variants
more
explicitly,
as
<"Foo">
or
<"Bar":123> for a variant with parameters.
The only purpose of these extensions is to have greater control over how OCaml
values are represented in JSON (for instance, storing a oating-point number as a JSON
string). The output still obeys the same standard format that can be easily exchanged
with other languages.
You can convert a Safe.json to a Basic.json type by using the to_basic function
as follows:
val to_basic : json -> Yojson.Basic.t
(** Tuples are converted to JSON arrays, Variants are converted to
JSON strings or arrays of a string (constructor) and a json value
(argument). Long integers are converted to JSON strings.
Examples:
`Tuple [ `Int 1; `Float 2.3 ]
->
`List [ `Int 1; `Float 2.3 ]
`Variant ("A", None)
->
`String "A"
`Variant ("B", Some x)
->
`List [ `String "B", x ]

354
Handling JSON Data
`Intlit "12345678901234567890"
->
`String
"12345678901234567890"
*)
19.6
Automatically Mapping JSON to OCaml Types
The combinators described previously make it easy to write functions that extract
elds from JSON records, but the process is still pretty manual. When you implement
larger specications, it's much easier to generate the mappings from JSON schemas to
OCaml values more mechanically than writing conversion functions individually.
We'll cover an alternative JSON processing method that is better for larger-scale
JSON handling now, using ATD2, which provides a domain specic language, or
DSL, that compiles JSON specications into OCaml modules, which are then used
throughout your application.
You can install the atdgen executable by calling opam install atdgen.
$ opam install atdgen
$ atdgen -version
2.2.1
You may need to run eval $(opam env) in your shell if you don't nd atdgen in
your path.
19.6.1
ATD Basics
The idea behind ATD is to specify the format of the JSON in a separate le and then
run a compiler (atdgen) that outputs OCaml code to construct and parse JSON values.
This means that you don't need to write any OCaml parsing code at all, as it will all be
autogenerated for you.
Let's go straight into looking at an example of how this works, by using a small
portion of the GitHub API. GitHub is a popular code hosting and sharing website that
provides a JSON-based web API3. The following ATD code fragment describes the
GitHub authorization API (which is based on a pseudostandard web protocol known
as OAuth):
type scope = [
User <json name="user">
| Public_repo <json name="public_repo">
| Repo <json name="repo">
| Repo_status <json name="repo_status">
| Delete_repo <json name="delete_repo">
| Gist <json name="gist">
]
type app = {
2 https://github.com/ahrefs/atd
3 http://developer.github.com

19.6 Compiling ATD Specications to OCaml
355
name: string;
url: string;
}
<ocaml field_prefix="app_">
type authorization_request = {
scopes: scope list;
note: string;
} <ocaml field_prefix="auth_req_">
type authorization_response = {
scopes: scope list;
token: string;
app: app;
url: string;
id: int;
?note: string option;
?note_url: string option;
}
The ATD specication syntax is deliberately quite similar to OCaml type denitions.
Every JSON record is assigned a type name (e.g., app in the preceding example). You
can also dene variants that are similar to OCaml's variant types (e.g., scope in the
example).
19.6.2
ATD Annotations
ATD does deviate from OCaml syntax due to its support for annotations within the
specication. The annotations can customize the code that is generated for a particular
target (of which the OCaml backend is of most interest to us).
For example, the preceding GitHub scope eld is dened as a variant type, with
each option starting with an uppercase letter as is conventional for OCaml variants.
However, the JSON values that come back from GitHub are actually lowercase and so
aren't exactly the same as the option name.
The annotation <json name="user"> signals that the JSON value of the eld is
user, but that the variable name of the parsed variant in OCaml should be User. These
annotations are often useful to map JSON values to reserved keywords in OCaml (e.g.,
type).
19.6.3
Compiling ATD Specications to OCaml
The ATD specication we dened can be compiled to OCaml code using the atdgen
command-line tool. Let's run the compiler twice to generate some OCaml type deni-
tions and a JSON serializing module that converts between input data and those type
denitions.
The atdgen command will generate some new les in your current directory.
github_t.ml and github_t.mli will contain an OCaml module with types dened
that correspond to the ATD le:
$ atdgen -t github.atd

356
Handling JSON Data
$ atdgen -j github.atd
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package atd -i github_t.mli
type scope =
[ `Delete_repo | `Gist | `Public_repo | `Repo | `Repo_status |
`User ]
type app = { app_name : string; app_url : string; }
type authorization_response = {
scopes : scope list;
token : string;
app : app;
url : string;
id : int;
note : string option;
note_url : string option;
}
type authorization_request = {
auth_req_scopes : scope list;
auth_req_note : string;
}
There is an obvious correspondence to the ATD denition. Note that eld names
in OCaml records in the same module cannot shadow one another, and so we instruct
ATDgen to prex every eld with a name that distinguishes it from other records
in the same module. For example, <ocaml field_prefix="auth_req_"> in the ATD
spec prexes every eld name in the generated authorization_request record with
auth_req.
The Github_t module only contains the type denitions, while Github_j provides
serialization functions to and from JSON. You can read the github_j.mli to see the
full interface, but the important functions for most uses are the conversion functions
to and from a string. For our preceding example, this looks like:
val string_of_authorization_request :
?len:int -> authorization_request -> string
(** Serialize a value of type {!authorization_request}
into a JSON string.
@param len specifies the initial length
of the buffer used internally.
Default: 1024. *)
val string_of_authorization_response :
?len:int -> authorization_response -> string
(** Serialize a value of type {!authorization_response}
into a JSON string.
@param len specifies the initial length
of the buffer used internally.
Default: 1024. *)
This is pretty convenient! We've now written a single ATD le, and all the OCaml
boilerplate to convert between JSON and a strongly typed record has been generated
for us. You can control various aspects of the serializer by passing ags to atdgen. The
important ones for JSON are:
-j-std Converts tuples and variants into standard JSON and refuses to print NaN and

19.6 Example: Querying GitHub Organization Information
357
innities. You should specify this if you intend to interoperate with services
that aren't using ATD.
-j-custom-fields FUNCTION Calls a custom function for every unknown eld
encountered, instead of raising a parsing exception.
-j-defaults Always explicitly outputs a JSON value if possible. This requires the
default value for that eld to be dened in the ATD specication.
The full ATD specication4 is quite sophisticated and documented online. The ATD
compiler can also target formats other than JSON and outputs code for other languages
(such as Java) if you need more interoperability.
There are also several similar projects that automate the code generation process.
Piqi5 supports conversions between XML, JSON, and the Google protobuf format; and
Thrift6 supports many other programming languages and includes OCaml bindings.
19.6.4
Example: Querying GitHub Organization Information
Let's nish up with an example of some live JSON parsing from GitHub and build
a tool to query organization information via their API. Start by looking at the online
API documentation7 for GitHub to see what the JSON schema for retrieving the
organization information looks like.
Now create an ATD le that covers the elds we need. Any extra elds present in the
response will be ignored by the ATD parser, so we don't need a completely exhaustive
specication of every eld that GitHub might send back:
type org = {
login: string;
id: int;
url: string;
?name: string option;
?blog: string option;
?email: string option;
public_repos: int
}
Let's build the OCaml type declaration rst by calling atdgen -t on the specication
le:
$ dune build github_org_t.mli
$ cat _build/default/github_org_t.mli
(* Auto-generated from "github_org.atd" *)
[@@@ocaml.warning "-27-32-35-39"]
type org = {
login: string;
id: int;
url: string;

5 http://piqi.org
6 http://thrift.apache.org
7 http://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/

358
Handling JSON Data
name: string option;
blog: string option;
email: string option;
public_repos: int
}
The OCaml type has an obvious mapping to the ATD spec, but we still need the
logic to convert JSON buers to and from this type. Calling atdgen -j will generate
this serialization code for us in a new le called github_org_j.ml:
$ dune build github_org_j.mli
$ cat _build/default/github_org_j.mli
(* Auto-generated from "github_org.atd" *)
[@@@ocaml.warning "-27-32-35-39"]
type org = Github_org_t.org = {
login: string;
id: int;
url: string;
name: string option;
blog: string option;
email: string option;
public_repos: int
}
val write_org :
Bi_outbuf.t -> org -> unit
(** Output a JSON value of type {!org}. *)
val string_of_org :
?len:int -> org -> string
(** Serialize a value of type {!org}
into a JSON string.
@param len specifies the initial length
of the buffer used internally.
Default: 1024. *)
val read_org :
Yojson.Safe.lexer_state -> Lexing.lexbuf -> org
(** Input JSON data of type {!org}. *)
val org_of_string :
string -> org
(** Deserialize JSON data of type {!org}. *)
The Github_org_j serializer interface contains everything we need to map to and
from the OCaml types and JSON. The easiest way to use this interface is by using
the string_of_org and org_of_string functions, but there are also more advanced
low-level buer functions available if you need higher performance (but we won't go
into that in this tutorial).
All we need to complete our example is an OCaml program that fetches the JSON
and uses these modules to output a one-line summary. Our following example does
just that.
The following code calls the cURL command-line utility by using the Shell interface

19.6 Example: Querying GitHub Organization Information
359
to run an external command and capture its output. You'll need to ensure that you have
cURL installed on your system before running the example. You might also need to
opam install shell if you haven't installed it previously:
open Core
let print_org file () =
let url = sprintf "https://api.github.com/orgs/%s" file in
Shell.run_full "curl" [url]
|> Github_org_j.org_of_string
|> fun org ->
let open Github_org_t in
let name = Option.value ~default:"???" org.name in
printf "%s (%d) with %d public repos\n"
name org.id org.public_repos
let () =
Command.basic_spec ~summary:"Print Github organization information"
Command.Spec.(empty +> anon ("organization" %: string))
print_org
|> Command.run
The following is a short shell script that generates all of the OCaml code and also
builds the nal executable:
(rule
(targets github_org_j.ml github_org_j.mli)
(deps
github_org.atd)
(mode
fallback)
(action
(run atdgen -j %{deps})))
(rule

(executable

(libraries core yojson atdgen shell)
(flags
:standard -w -32)
(modules
github_org_info github_org_t github_org_j))
$ dune build github_org_info.exe
You can now run the command-line tool with a single argument to specify the name
of the organization, and it will dynamically fetch the JSON from the web, parse it, and
render the summary to your console:
$ dune exec -- ./github_org_info.exe mirage
MirageOS (131943) with 125 public repos
$ dune exec -- ./github_org_info.exe janestreet
??? (3384712) with 145 public repos
The JSON returned from the janestreet query is missing an organization name,
but this is explicitly reected in the OCaml type, since the ATD spec marked name

as an optional eld. Our OCaml code explicitly handles this case and doesn't have to
worry about null-pointer exceptions. Similarly, the JSON integer for the id is mapped
into a native OCaml integer via the ATD conversion.
While this tool is obviously quite simple, the ability to specify optional and default
elds is very powerful. Take a look at the full ATD specication for the GitHub API
in the ocaml-github8 repository online, which has lots of quirks typical in real-world
web APIs.
Our example shells out to curl on the command line to obtain the JSON, which
is rather inecient. You could integrate an Async-based HTTP fetch directly into
your OCaml application, as described in Chapter 17 (Concurrent Programming with
Async).

Parsing with OCamllex and Menhir
This chapter includes contributions from Jason Hickey.
Many programming tasks start with the interpretation of some form of structured
textual data. Parsing is the process of converting such data into data structures that are
easy to program against. For simple formats, it's often enough to parse the data in an
ad hoc way, say, by breaking up the data into lines, and then using regular expressions
for breaking those lines down into their component pieces.
But this simplistic approach tends to fall down when parsing more complicated
data, particularly data with the kind of recursive structure you nd in full-blown
programming languages or exible data formats like JSON and XML. Parsing such
formats accurately and eciently while providing useful error messages is a complex
task.
Often, you can nd an existing parsing library that handles these issues for you. But
there are tools to simplify the task when you do need to write a parser, in the form of
parser generators. A parser generator creates a parser from a specication of the data
format that you want to parse, and uses that to generate a parser.
Parser generators have a long history, including tools like lex and yacc that date
back to the early 1970s. OCaml has its own alternatives, including ocamllex, which
replaces lex, and ocamlyacc and menhir, which replace yacc. We'll explore these
tools in the course of walking through the implementation of a parser for the JSON
serialization format that we discussed in Chapter 19 (Handling JSON Data).
Parsing is a broad and often intricate topic, and our purpose here is not to teach
all of the theoretical issues, but to provide a pragmatic introduction of how to build a
parser in OCaml.
Menhir Versus ocamlyacc
Menhir is an alternative parser generator that is generally superior to the venerable
ocamlyacc, which dates back quite a few years. Menhir is mostly compatible with
ocamlyacc grammars, and so you can usually just switch to Menhir and expect older
code to work (with some minor dierences described in the Menhir manual).
The biggest advantage of Menhir is that its error messages are generally more
human-comprehensible, and the parsers that it generates are fully reentrant and can be
parameterized in OCaml modules more easily. We recommend that any new code you
develop should use Menhir instead of ocamlyacc.

Menhir isn't distributed directly with OCaml but is available through OPAM by
running opam install menhir.
20.1
Lexing and Parsing
Parsing is traditionally broken down into two parts: lexical analysis, which is a kind of
simplied parsing phase that converts a stream of characters into a stream of logical
tokens; and full-on parsing, which involves converting a stream of tokens into the nal
representation, which is often in the form of a tree-like data structure called an abstract
syntax tree, or AST.
It's confusing that the term parsing is applied to both the overallprocess of converting
textual data to structured data, and also more specically to the second phase of
converting a stream of tokens to an AST; so from here on out, we'll use the term
parsing to refer only to this second phase.
Let's consider lexing and parsing in the context of the JSON format. Here's a snippet
of text that represents a JSON object containing a string labeled title and an array
containing two objects, each with a name and array of zip codes:
{
"title": "Cities",
"cities": [
{ "name": "Chicago",
"zips": [60601] },
{ "name": "New York", "zips": [10004] }
]
}
At a syntactic level, we can think of a JSON le as a series of simple logical units,
like curly braces, square brackets, commas, colons, identiers, numbers, and quoted
strings. Thus, we could represent our JSON text as a sequence of tokens of the following
type:
type token =
| NULL
| TRUE
| FALSE
| STRING of string
| INT of int
| FLOAT of float
| LEFT_BRACK
| RIGHT_BRACK
| LEFT_BRACE
| RIGHT_BRACE
| COMMA
| COLON
| EOF
Note that this representation loses some information about the original text. For
example, whitespace is not represented. It's common, and indeed useful, for the token
stream to forget some details of the original text that are not required for understanding
its meaning.

20.2 Dening a Parser
363
If we converted the preceding example into a list of these tokens, it would look
something like this:
[ LEFT_BRACE; STRING("title"); COLON; STRING("Cities");
COMMA; STRING("cities"); ... ]
This kind of representation is easier to work with than the original text, since it
gets rid of some unimportant syntactic details and adds useful structure. But it's still a
good deal more low-level than the simple AST we used for representing JSON data in
Chapter 19 (Handling JSON Data):
type value =
[ `Assoc of (string * value) list
| `Bool of bool
| `Float of float
| `Int of int
| `List of value list
| `Null
| `String of string ]
This representation is much richer than our token stream, capturing the fact that
JSON values can be nested inside each other and that JSON has a variety of value types,
including numbers, strings, arrays, and objects. The parser we'll write will convert a
token stream into a value of this AST type, as shown below for our earlier JSON
example:
`Assoc
["title", `String "Cities";
"cities", `List
[`Assoc ["name", `String "Chicago"; "zips", `List [`Int 60601]];
`Assoc ["name", `String "New York"; "zips", `List [`Int
10004]]]]
20.2
Dening a Parser
A parser-specication le has sux .mly and contains two sections that are broken
up by separator lines consisting of the characters %% on a line by themselves. The rst
section of the le is for declarations, including token and type specications, prece-
dence directives, and other output directives; and the second section is for specifying
the grammar of the language to be parsed.
We'll start by declaring the list of tokens. A token is declared using the syntax
%token <type>uid, where the <type> is optional and uid is a capitalized identier. For
JSON, we need tokens for numbers, strings, identiers, and punctuation:
%token <int> INT
%token <float> FLOAT
%token <string> ID
%token <string> STRING
%token TRUE
%token FALSE
%token NULL

364
Parsing with OCamllex and Menhir
%token LEFT_BRACE
%token RIGHT_BRACE
%token LEFT_BRACK
%token RIGHT_BRACK
%token COLON
%token COMMA
%token EOF
The <type> specications mean that a token carries a value. The INT token carries
an integer value with it, FLOAT has a float value, and STRING carries a string value.
The remaining tokens, such as TRUE, FALSE, or the punctuation, aren't associated with
any value, and so we can omit the <type> specication.
20.2.1
Describing the Grammar
The next thing we need to do is to specify the grammar of a JSON expression. menhir,
like many parser generators, expresses grammars as context-free grammars. (More
precisely, menhir supports LR(1) grammars, but we will ignore that technical distinc-
tion here.) You can think of a context-free grammar as a set of abstract names, called
non-terminal symbols, along with a collection of rules for transforming a nonterminal
symbol into a sequence of tokens and nonterminal symbols. A sequence of tokens
is parsable by a grammar if you can apply the grammar's rules to produce a series
of transformations, starting at a distinguished start symbol that produces the token
sequence in question.
We'll start describing the JSON grammar by declaring the start symbol to be the
non-terminal symbol prog, and by declaring that when parsed, a prog value should
be converted into an OCaml value of type Json.value option. We then end the
declaration section of the parser with a %%:
%start <Json.value option> prog
%%
Once that's in place, we can start specifying the productions. In menhir, productions
are organized into rules, where each rule lists all the possible productions for a given
nonterminal symbol. Here, for example, is the rule for prog:
prog:
| EOF
{ None }
| v = value { Some v }
;
The syntax for this is reminiscent of an OCaml match expression. The pipes separate
the individual productions, and the curly braces contain a semantic action: OCaml code
that generates the OCaml value corresponding to the production in question. Semantic
actions are arbitrary OCaml expressions that are evaluated during parsing to produce
values that are attached to the non-terminal in the rule.
We have two cases for prog: either there's an EOF, which means the text is empty,
and so there's no JSON value to read, we return the OCaml value None; or we have an
instance of the value nonterminal, which corresponds to a well-formed JSON value,

20.2 Parsing Sequences
365
and we wrap the corresponding Json.value in a Some tag. Note that in the value case,
we wrote v = value to bind the OCaml value that corresponds to the variable v, which
we can then use within the curly braces for that production.
Now let's consider a more complex example, the rule for the value symbol:
value:
| LEFT_BRACE; obj = object_fields; RIGHT_BRACE
{ `Assoc obj }
| LEFT_BRACK; vl = array_values; RIGHT_BRACK
{ `List vl }
| s = STRING
{ `String s }
| i = INT
{ `Int i }
| x = FLOAT
{ `Float x }
| TRUE
{ `Bool true }
| FALSE
{ `Bool false }
| NULL
{ `Null }
;
According to these rules, a JSON value is either:
• An object bracketed by curly braces
• An array bracketed by square braces
• A string, integer, oat, bool, or null value
In each of the productions, the OCaml code in curly braces shows what to transform
the object in question to. Note that we still have two nonterminals whose denitions
we depend on here but have not yet dened: object_fields and array_values. We'll
look at how these are parsed next.
20.2.2
Parsing Sequences
The rule for object_fields follows, and is really just a thin wrapper that reverses the
list returned by the following rule for rev_object_fields. Note that the rst production
in rev_object_fields has an empty left-hand side, because what we're matching on
in this case is an empty sequence of tokens. The comment (* empty *) is used to
make this clear:
object_fields: obj = rev_object_fields { List.rev obj };
rev_object_fields:
| (* empty *) { [] }
| obj = rev_object_fields; COMMA; k = ID; COLON; v = value
{ (k, v) :: obj }
;
The rules are structured as they are because menhir generates left-recursive parsers,
which means that the constructed pushdown automaton uses less stack space with

366
Parsing with OCamllex and Menhir
left-recursive denitions. The following right-recursive rule accepts the same input,
but during parsing, it requires linear stack space to read object eld denitions:
(* Inefficient right-recursive rule *)
object_fields:
| (* empty *) { [] }
| k = STRING; COLON; v = value; COMMA; obj = object_fields
{ (k, v) :: obj }
Alternatively, we could keep the left-recursive denition and simply construct the
returned value in left-to-right order. This is even less ecient, since the complexity of
building the list incrementally in this way is quadratic in the length of the list:
(* Quadratic left-recursive rule *)
object_fields:
| (* empty *) { [] }
| obj = object_fields; COMMA; k = STRING; COLON; v = value
{ obj @ [k, v] }
;
Assembling lists like this is a pretty common requirement in most realistic grammars,
and the preceding rules (while useful for illustrating how parsing works) are rather
verbose. Menhir features an extended standard library of built-in rules to simplify this
handling. These rules are detailed in the Menhir manual and include optional values,
pairs of values with optional separators, and lists of elements (also with optional
separators).
A version of the JSON grammar using these more succinct Menhir rules follows.
Notice the use of separated_list to parse both JSON objects and lists with one rule:
%token <int> INT
%token <float> FLOAT
%token <string> STRING
%token TRUE
%token FALSE
%token NULL
%token LEFT_BRACE
%token RIGHT_BRACE
%token LEFT_BRACK
%token RIGHT_BRACK
%token COLON
%token COMMA
%token EOF
%start <Json.value option> prog
%%
prog:
| v = value { Some v }
| EOF
{ None
} ;
value:
| LEFT_BRACE; obj = obj_fields; RIGHT_BRACE { `Assoc obj
}
| LEFT_BRACK; vl = list_fields; RIGHT_BRACK { `List vl
}
| s = STRING
{ `String s
}
| i = INT
{ `Int i
}
| x = FLOAT
{ `Float x
}

20.3 Regular Expressions
367
| TRUE
{ `Bool true
}
| FALSE
{ `Bool false }
| NULL
{ `Null
} ;
obj_fields:
obj = separated_list(COMMA, obj_field)
{ obj } ;
obj_field:
k = STRING; COLON; v = value
{ (k, v) } ;
list_fields:
vl = separated_list(COMMA, value)
{ vl } ;
We can hook in menhir by adding a (menhir) stanza to our dune le, which tells
the build system to switch to using menhir instead of ocamlyacc to handle les with
the .mly sux:
(menhir
(modules parser))
(ocamllex lexer)
(library
(name json_parser)
(modules parser lexer json)
(libraries core))
20.3
Dening a Lexer
Now we can dene a lexer, using ocamllex, to convert our input text into a stream of
tokens. The specication of the lexer is placed in a le with an .mll sux.
20.3.1
OCaml Prelude
Let's walk through the denition of a lexer section by section. The rst section is an
optional chunk of OCaml code that is bounded by a pair of curly braces:
{
open Lexing
open Parser
exception SyntaxError of string
}
This code is there to dene utility functions used by later snippets of OCaml code
and to set up the environment by opening useful modules and dene an exception,
SyntaxError. Any OCaml functions you dene here will be subsequently available in
the remainder of the lexer denition.

368
Parsing with OCamllex and Menhir
20.3.2
Regular Expressions
The next section of the lexing le is a collection of named regular expressions. These
look syntactically like ordinary OCaml let bindings, but really this is a specialized
syntax for declaring regular expressions. Here's an example:
let int = '-'? ['0'-'9'] ['0'-'9']*
The syntax here is something of a hybrid between OCaml syntax and traditional
regular expression syntax. The int regular expression species an optional leading -,
followed by a digit from 0 to 9, followed by some number of digits from 0 to 9. The
question mark is used to indicate an optional component of a regular expression; the
square brackets are used to specify ranges; and the * operator is used to indicate a
(possibly empty) repetition.
Floating-point numbers are specied similarly, but we deal with decimal points and
exponents. We make the expression easier to read by building up a sequence of named
regular expressions, rather than creating one big and impenetrable expression:
let digit = ['0'-'9']
let frac = '.' digit*
let exp = ['e' 'E'] ['-' '+']? digit+
let float = digit* frac? exp?
Finally, we dene whitespace, newlines, and identiers:
let white = [' ' '\t']+
let newline = '\r' | '\n' | "\r\n"
let id = ['a'-'z' 'A'-'Z' '_'] ['a'-'z' 'A'-'Z' '0'-'9' '_']*
The newline introduces the | operator, which lets one of several alternative regular
expressions match (in this case, the various carriage-return combinations of CR, LF,
or CRLF).
20.3.3
Lexing Rules
The lexing rules are essentially functions that consume the data, producing OCaml
expressions that evaluate to tokens. These OCaml expressions can be quite complicated,
using side eects and invoking other rules as part of the body of the rule. Let's look at
the read rule for parsing a JSON expression:
rule read =
parse
| white
{ read lexbuf }
| newline
{ next_line lexbuf; read lexbuf }
| int
{ INT (int_of_string (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf)) }
| float
{ FLOAT (float_of_string (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf)) }
| "true"
{ TRUE }
| "false"
{ FALSE }
| "null"
{ NULL }
| '"'
{ read_string (Buffer.create 17) lexbuf }
| '{'
{ LEFT_BRACE }
| '}'
{ RIGHT_BRACE }
| '['
{ LEFT_BRACK }

20.3 Lexing Rules
369
| ']'
{ RIGHT_BRACK }
| ':'
{ COLON }
| ','
{ COMMA }
| _ { raise (SyntaxError ("Unexpected char: " ^ Lexing.lexeme
lexbuf)) }
| eof
{ EOF }
The rules are structured very similarly to pattern matches, except that the variants
are replaced by regular expressions on the left-hand side. The right-hand side clause
is the parsed OCaml return value of that rule. The OCaml code for the rules has a
parameter called lexbuf that denes the input, including the position in the input le,
as well as the text that was matched by the regular expression.
The rst white { read lexbuf } calls the lexer recursively. That is, it skips the
input whitespace and returns the following token. The action newline { next_line
lexbuf; read lexbuf } is similar, but we use it to advance the line number for the
lexer using the utility function that we dened at the top of the le. Let's skip to the
third action:
| int { INT (int_of_string (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf)) }
This action species that when the input matches the int regular expression,
then the lexer should return the expression INT (int_of_string (Lexing.lexeme
lexbuf)). The expression Lexing.lexeme lexbuf returns the complete string matched
by the regular expression. In this case, the string represents a number, so we use the
int_of_string function to convert it to a number.
There are actions for each dierent kind of token. The string expressions like
"true" { TRUE } are used for keywords, and the special characters have actions, too,
like '{' { LEFT_BRACE }.
Some of these patterns overlap. For example, the regular expression "true" is also
matched by the id pattern. ocamllex used the following disambiguation when a prex
of the input is matched by more than one pattern:
• The longest match always wins. For example, the rst input trueX: 167 matches the
regular expression "true" for four characters, and it matches id for ve characters.
The longer match wins, and the return value is ID "trueX".
• If all matches have the same length, then the rst action wins. If the input were
true: 167, then both "true" and id match the rst four characters; "true" is
rst, so the return value is TRUE.
Unused Lexing Values
In our parser, we have not used all the token regexps that we dened in the lexer. For
instance, id is unused since we do not parse unquoted strings for object identiers
(something that is allowed by JavaScript, but not the subset of it that is JSON). If
we included a token pattern match for this in the lexer, then we would have to adjust
the parser accordingly to add a %token <string> ID. This would in turn trigger an
unused warning since the parser never constructs a value with type ID:
File "parser.mly", line 4, characters 16-18:

370
Parsing with OCamllex and Menhir
Warning: the token ID is unused.
It's completely ne to dene unused regexps as we've done, and to hook them into
parsers as required. For example, we might use ID if we add an extension to our parser
for supporting unquoted string identiers as a non-standard JSON extension.
20.3.4
Recursive Rules
Unlike many other lexer generators, ocamllex allows the denition of multiple lexers
in the same le, and the denitions can be recursive. In this case, we use recursion to
match string literals using the following rule denition:
and read_string buf =
parse
| '"'
{ STRING (Buffer.contents buf) }
| '\\' '/'
{ Buffer.add_char buf '/'; read_string buf lexbuf }
| '\\' '\\' { Buffer.add_char buf '\\'; read_string buf lexbuf }
| '\\' 'b'
{ Buffer.add_char buf '\b'; read_string buf lexbuf }
| '\\' 'f'
{ Buffer.add_char buf '\012'; read_string buf lexbuf }
| '\\' 'n'
{ Buffer.add_char buf '\n'; read_string buf lexbuf }
| '\\' 'r'
{ Buffer.add_char buf '\r'; read_string buf lexbuf }
| '\\' 't'
{ Buffer.add_char buf '\t'; read_string buf lexbuf }
| [^ '"' '\\']+
{ Buffer.add_string buf (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf);
read_string buf lexbuf
}
| _ { raise (SyntaxError ("Illegal string character: " ^
Lexing.lexeme lexbuf)) }
| eof { raise (SyntaxError ("String is not terminated")) }
This rule takes a buf : Buffer.t as an argument. If we reach the terminating double
quote ", then we return the contents of the buer as a STRING.
The other cases are for handling the string contents. The action [^ '"' '\\']+ {
... } matches normal input that does not contain a double quote or backslash. The
actions beginning with a backslash \ dene what to do for escape sequences. In each
of these cases, the nal step includes a recursive call to the lexer.
That covers the lexer. Next, we need to combine the lexer with the parser to bring it
all together.
Handling Unicode
We've glossed over an important detail here: parsing Unicode characters to handle the
full spectrum of the world's writing systems. OCaml has several third-party solutions
to handling Unicode, with varying degrees of exibility and complexity:
• Uutfa is a nonblocking streaming Unicode codec for OCaml, available as a standalone
library. It is accompanied by the Uunfb text normalization and Uucdc Unicode
character database libraries. There is also a robust parser for JSONd available
that illustrates the use of Uutf in your own libraries.

20.4 Bringing It All Together
371
• Camomilee supports the full spectrum of Unicode character types, conversion from
around 200 encodings, and collation and locale-sensitive case mappings.
• sedlexf isalexergeneratorforUnicodethatcanserveasaUnicode-awarereplacement
for ocamllex.
All of these libraries are available via opam under their respective names.

d http://erratique.ch/software/jsonm
e https://github.com/yoriyuki/Camomile
f https://github.com/ocaml-community/sedlex
20.4
Bringing It All Together
For the nal part, we need to compose the lexer and parser. As we saw in the type
denition in parser.mli, the parsing function expects a lexer of type Lexing.lexbuf
-> token, and a lexbuf:
val prog : (Lexing.lexbuf -> token) -> Lexing.lexbuf -> Json.value
option
Before we start with the lexing, let's rst dene some functions to handle parsing er-
rors. There are currently two errors: Parser.Error and Lexer.SyntaxError. A simple
solution when encountering an error is to print the error and give up:
open Core
open Lexer
open Lexing
let print_position outx lexbuf =
let pos = lexbuf.lex_curr_p in
fprintf outx "%s:%d:%d" pos.pos_fname
pos.pos_lnum (pos.pos_cnum - pos.pos_bol + 1)
let parse_with_error lexbuf =
try Parser.prog Lexer.read lexbuf with
| SyntaxError msg ->
fprintf stderr "%a: %s\n" print_position lexbuf msg;
None
| Parser.Error ->
fprintf stderr "%a: syntax error\n" print_position lexbuf;
exit (-1)
The give up on the rst error approach is easy to implement but isn't very friendly.
In general, error handling can be pretty intricate, and we won't discuss it here. However,
the Menhir parser denes additional mechanisms you can use to try and recover from
errors. These are described in detail in its reference manual1.
The standard lexing library Lexing provides a function from_channel to read
1 http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/

372
Parsing with OCamllex and Menhir
the input from a channel. The following function describes the structure, where the
Lexing.from_channel function is used to construct a lexbuf, which is passed with the
lexing function Lexer.read to the Parser.prog function. Parsing.prog returns None
when it reaches end of le. We dene a function Json.output_value, not shown here,
to print a Json.value:
let rec parse_and_print lexbuf =
match parse_with_error lexbuf with
| Some value ->
printf "%a\n" Json.output_value value;
parse_and_print lexbuf
| None -> ()
let loop filename () =
let inx = In_channel.create filename in
let lexbuf = Lexing.from_channel inx in
lexbuf.lex_curr_p <- { lexbuf.lex_curr_p with pos_fname = filename
};
parse_and_print lexbuf;
In_channel.close inx
let () =
Command.basic_spec ~summary:"Parse and display JSON"
Command.Spec.(empty +> anon ("filename" %: string))
loop
|> Command.run
Here's a test input le we can use to test the code we just wrote:
true
false
null
[1, 2, 3., 4.0, .5, 5.5e5, 6.3]
"Hello World"
{ "field1": "Hello",
"field2": 17e13,
"field3": [1, 2, 3],
"field4": { "fieldA": 1, "fieldB": "Hello" }
}
Now build and run the example using this le, and you can see the full parser in
action:
$ dune exec ./test.exe test1.json
true
false
null
[1, 2, 3.000000, 4.000000, 0.500000, 550000.000000, 6.300000]
"Hello World"
{ "field1": "Hello",
"field2": 170000000000000.000000,
"field3": [1, 2, 3],
"field4": { "fieldA": 1,
"fieldB": "Hello" } }
With our simple error handling scheme, errors are fatal and cause the program to
terminate with a nonzero exit code:

20.4 Bringing It All Together
373
$ cat test2.json
{ "name": "Chicago",
"zips": [12345,
}
{ "name": "New York",
"zips": [10004]
}
$ dune exec ./test.exe test2.json
test2.json:3:2: syntax error
[255]
That wraps up our parsing tutorial. As an aside, notice that the JSON polymorphic
variant type that we dened in this chapter is actually structurally compatible with the
Yojson representation explained in Chapter 19 (Handling JSON Data). That means that
you can take this parser and use it with the helper functions in Yojson to build more
sophisticated applications.

21
Data Serialization with
S-Expressions
S-expressions are nested parenthetical expressions whose atomic values are strings.
They were rst popularized by the Lisp programming language in the 1960s, and have
remained one of the simplest and most eective ways to encode structured data in a
human-readable and editable form.
An example s-expression might look like this.
(this (is an) (s expression))
S-expressions play a major role in Base and Core, eectively acting as the default
serialization format. Indeed, we've encountered s-expressions multiple times already,
including in Chapter 8 (Error Handling), Chapter 11 (Functors), and Chapter 12 (First-
Class Modules).
This chapter will go into s-expressions in more depth. In particular, we'll discuss:
• The details of the s-expression format, including how to parse it while generating
good error messages for debugging malformed inputs
• How to generate converters between s-expressions and arbitrary OCaml types
• How to use annotations to control the behavior of these generated converters
• How to integrate s-expressions into your interfaces, in particular how to add s-
expression converters to a module without breaking abstraction boundaries
We'll tie this together at the end of the chapter with a simple s-expression formatted
conguration le for a web server
21.1
Basic Usage
The type used to represent an s-expression is quite simple:
module Sexp : sig
type t =
| Atom of string
| List of t list
end
An s-expression can be thought of as a tree where each node contains a list of its
children, and where the leaves of the tree are strings. Core provides good support for
s-expressions in its Sexp module, including functions for converting s-expressions to
and from strings. Let's rewrite our example s-expression in terms of this type:

21.1 Basic Usage
375
# open Core;;
# Sexp.List [
Sexp.Atom "this";
Sexp.List [ Sexp.Atom "is"; Sexp.Atom "an"];
Sexp.List [ Sexp.Atom "s"; Sexp.Atom "expression" ];
];;
- : Sexp.t = (this (is an) (s expression))
This prints out nicely because Core registers a pretty printer with the toplevel. This
pretty printer is based on the functions in Sexp for converting s-expressions to and
from strings:
# Sexp.to_string (Sexp.List [Sexp.Atom "1"; Sexp.Atom "2"]);;
- : string = "(1 2)"
# Sexp.of_string ("(1 2 (3 4))");;
- : Sexp.t = (1 2 (3 4))
Base, Core, and Parsexp
In these examples, we're using Core rather than Base because Core has integrated
support for parsing s-expressions, courtesy of the Parsexp library. If you just use Base,
you'll nd that you don't have Sexp.of_string at your disposal.
# open Base;;
# Sexp.of_string "(1 2 3)";;
Line 1, characters 1-15:
Alert deprecated: Base.Sexp.of_string
[since 2018-02] Use [Parsexp.Single.parse_string_exn]
Line 1, characters 1-15:
Error: This expression has type unit
This is not a function; it cannot be applied.
That's because, in an attempt to keep Base light, the s-expression parsing functions
aren't included. That said, you can always use them by calling out to the corresponding
functions from the Parsexp library:
# Parsexp.Single.parse_string_exn "(1 2 3)";;
- : Sexp.t = (1 2 3)
In addition to providing the Sexp module, most of the base types in Base and Core
support conversion to and from s-expressions. For example, we can use the conversion
functions dened in the respective modules for integers, strings, and exceptions:
# Int.sexp_of_t 3;;
- : Sexp.t = 3
# String.sexp_of_t "hello";;
- : Sexp.t = hello
# Exn.sexp_of_t (Invalid_argument "foo");;
- : Sexp.t = (Invalid_argument foo)
It's also possible to convert container types such as lists or arrays that are polymor-
phic over the type of data they contain.
# #show List.sexp_of_t;;
val sexp_of_t : ('a -> Sexp.t) -> 'a list -> Sexp.t

376
Data Serialization with S-Expressions
Notice that List.sexp_of_t is polymorphic and takes as its rst argument another
conversion function to handle the elements of the list to be converted. Base and Core
use this scheme more generally for dening sexp converters for polymorphic types.
Here's an example of it in action.
# List.sexp_of_t Int.sexp_of_t [1; 2; 3];;
- : Sexp.t = (1 2 3)
The functions that go in the other direction, i.e., reconstruct an OCaml value from an
s-expression, use essentially the same trick for handling polymorphic types, as shown
below.
# List.t_of_sexp Int.t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "(1 2 3)");;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
Such a function will fail with an exception when presented with an s-expression that
doesn't match the structure of the OCaml type in question.
# List.t_of_sexp Int.t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "(1 2 three)");;
Exception:
(Of_sexp_error "int_of_sexp: (Failure int_of_string)" (invalid_sexp
three))
More on Top-Level Printing
The values of the s-expressions that we created were printed properly as s-expressions
in the toplevel, instead of as the tree of Atom and List variants that they're actually
made of.
This isduetoOCaml'sfacilityforinstallingcustom top-levelprinters thatcanrewrite
some values into more top-level-friendly equivalents. They are generally installed as
ocamlfind packages ending in top:
$ ocamlfind list | grep top
astring.top
(version: 0.8.3)
cohttp.top
(version: n/a)
compiler-libs.toplevel (version: [distributed with Ocaml])
core.top
(version: v0.10.0)
...
uri.top
(version: 1.9.6)
utop
(version: 2.1.0)
The core.top package (which you should have loaded by default in your .ocamlinit
le) loads in printers for the Core extensions already, so you don't need to do anything
special to use the s-expression printer.
21.1.1
S-Expression Converters for New Types
But what if you want a function to convert a brand new type to an s-expression? You
can of course write it yourself manually. Here's an example.
# type t = { foo: int; bar: float };;
type t = { foo : int; bar : float; }
# let sexp_of_t t =

21.1 S-Expression Converters for New Types
377
let a x = Sexp.Atom x and l x = Sexp.List x in
l [ l [a "foo"; Int.sexp_of_t t.foo
];
l [a "bar"; Float.sexp_of_t t.bar]; ];;
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# sexp_of_t { foo = 3; bar = -5.5 };;
- : Sexp.t = ((foo 3) (bar -5.5))
This is somewhat tiresome to write, and it gets more so when you consider the parser,
i.e., t_of_sexp, which is considerably more complex. Writing this kind of parsing and
printing code by hand is mechanical and error prone, not to mention a drag.
Given how mechanical the code is, you could imagine writing a program that
inspects the type denition and automatically generates the conversion code for you.
As it turns out, there's a syntax extension called ppx_sexp_conv which does just that,
creating the required functions for every type annotated with [@@deriving sexp]. To
enable ppx_sexp_conv, we're going to enable ppx_jane, which is a larger collection of
useful extensions that includes ppx_sexp_conv.
# #require "ppx_jane";;
We can use the extension as follows.
# type t = { foo: int; bar: float } [@@deriving sexp];;
type t = { foo : int; bar : float; }
val t_of_sexp : Sexp.t -> t = <fun>
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "((bar 35) (foo 3))");;
- : t = {foo = 3; bar = 35.}
The syntax extension can be used outside of type declarations as well. As discussed
in Chapter 8 (Error Handling), [@@deriving sexp] can be attached to the declaration
of an exception to improve the quality of errors printed by OCaml's top-level exception
handler.
Here are two exception declarations, one with an annotation, and one without:
exception Ordinary_exn of string list;;
exception Exn_with_sexp of string list [@@deriving sexp];;
And here's the dierence in what you see when you throw these exceptions.
# raise (Ordinary_exn ["1";"2";"3"]);;
Exception: Ordinary_exn(_).
# raise (Exn_with_sexp ["1";"2";"3"]);;
Exception: (//toplevel//.Exn_with_sexp (1 2 3))
ppx_sexp_conv also supports inline declarations that generate converters for anony-
mous types.
# [%sexp_of: int * string ];;
- : int * string -> Sexp.t = <fun>
# [%sexp_of: int * string ] (3, "foo");;
- : Sexp.t = (3 foo)
The syntax extensions bundled with Base and Core almost all have the same basic
structure: they auto-generate code based on type denitions, implementing functional-
ity that you could in theory have implemented by hand, but with far less programmer
eort.

378
Data Serialization with S-Expressions
Syntax Extensions and PPX
OCaml doesn't directly support deriving s-expression converters from type denitions.
Instead, it provides a mechanism called PPX which allows you to add to the compilation
pipeline code for transforming OCaml programs at the syntactic level, via the -ppx
compiler ag.
PPXs operate on OCaml's abstract syntax tree, or AST, which is a data type that
represents the syntax of a well-formed OCaml program. Annotations like [%sexp_of:
int] or [@@deriving sexp] are part of special extensions to the syntax, called exten-
sion points, which were added to the language to give a place to put information that
would be consumed by syntax extensions like ppx_sexp_conv.
ppx_sexp_conv is part of a family of syntax extensions, including ppx_compare, de-
scribed in Chapter 15 (Maps and Hash Tables), and ppx_fields, described in Chapter 6
(Records), that generate code based on type declarations.
Using these extensions from a dune le is as simple as adding this directive to a
(library) or (executable) stanza to indicate that the les should be run through a
preprocessor:
(executable
(name hello)
(preprocess (pps ppx_sexp_conv))
)
21.2
The Sexp Format
The textual representation of s-expressions is pretty straightforward. An s-expression
is written down as a nested parenthetical expression, with whitespace-separated strings
as the atoms. Quotes are used for atoms that contain parentheses or spaces themselves;
backslash is the escape character; and semicolons are used to introduce single-line
comments. Thus, the following le, example.scm:
((foo 3.3) ;; This is a comment
(bar "this is () an \" atom"))
can be loaded as follows.
# Sexp.load_sexp "example.scm";;
- : Sexp.t = ((foo 3.3) (bar "this is () an \" atom"))
As you can see, the comment is not part of the loaded s-expression.
All in, the s-expression format supports three comment syntaxes:
; Comments out everything to the end of line
#|,|# Delimiters for commenting out a block
#; Comments out the rst complete s-expression that follows
The following example shows all of these in action:

21.3 Preserving Invariants
379
;; comment_heavy_example.scm
((this is included)
; (this is commented out
(this stays)
#; (all of this is commented
out (even though it crosses lines.))
(and #| block delimiters #| which can be nested |#
will comment out
an arbitrary multi-line block))) |#
now we're done
))
Again, loading the le as an s-expression drops the comments:
# Sexp.load_sexp "comment_heavy.scm";;
- : Sexp.t = ((this is included) (this stays) (and now we're done))
If we introduce an error into our s-expression, by, say, creating a le
broken_example.scm which is example.scm, without the open-paren in front of bar,
we'll get a parse error:
# Sexp.load_sexp "example_broken.scm";;
Exception:
(Sexplib.Sexp.Parse_error
((err_msg "unexpected character: ')'") (text_line 4) (text_char 30)
(global_offset 78) (buf_pos 78)))
21.3
Preserving Invariants
Modules and module interfaces are an important part of how OCaml code is structured
and designed. One of the key reasons we use module interfaces is to make it possible
to enforce invariants. In particular, by restricting how values of a given type can be
created and transformed, interfaces let you enforce various rules, including ensuring
that your data is well-formed.
When you add s-expression converters (or really any deserializer) to an API, you're
adding an alternate path for creating values, and if you're not careful, that alternate
path can violate the carefully maintained invariants of your code.
In the following, we'll show how this problem can crop up, and how to resolve it.
Let's consider a module Int_interval for representing closed integer intervals, similar
to the one described in Chapter 11 (Functors).
Here's the signature.
type t [@@deriving sexp]
(** [create lo hi] creates an interval from [lo] to [hi] inclusive,
and is empty if [lo > hi]. *)
val create : int -> int -> t
val is_empty : t -> bool
val contains : t -> int -> bool

380
Data Serialization with S-Expressions
In addition to basic operations for creating and evaluating intervals, this interface
also exposes s-expression converters. Note that the [@@deriving sexp] syntax works
in a signature as well, but in this case, it just adds the signature for the conversion
functions, not the implementation.
Here's the implementation of Int_interval.
open Core
(* for [Range (x,y)], we require that [y >= x] *)
type t =
| Range of int * int
| Empty
[@@deriving sexp]
let create x y = if x > y then Empty else Range (x, y)
let is_empty = function
| Empty -> true
| Range _ -> false
let contains i x =
match i with
| Empty -> false
| Range (low, high) -> x >= low && x <= high
One critical invariant here is that Range is only used to represent non-empty intervals.
A call to create with a lower bound above the upper bound will return an Empty.
Now, let's demonstrate the functionality with some tests, using the expect test
framework described in Chapter 18.2 (Expect Tests). First, we'll write a test helper that
takes an interval and a list of points, and prints out the result of checking for emptiness,
and a classication of which points are inside and outside the interval.
let test_interval i points =
let in_, out =
List.partition_tf points ~f:(fun x -> Int_interval.contains i x)
in
let to_string l =
List.map ~f:Int.to_string l |> String.concat ~sep:", "
in
print_endline
(String.concat
~sep:"\n"
[ (if Int_interval.is_empty i then "empty" else "non-empty")
; "in:
" ^ to_string in_
; "out: " ^ to_string out
])
We can run this test on a non-empty interval,
let%expect_test "ordinary interval" =
test_interval (Int_interval.create 3 6) (List.range 1 10);
[%expect
{|
non-empty
in:
3, 4, 5, 6
out: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 |}]

21.3 Preserving Invariants
381
And also on an empty one.
let%expect_test "empty interval" =
test_interval (Int_interval.create 6 3) (List.range 1 10);
[%expect {|
empty
in:
out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |}]
Note that the result of checking is_empty lines up with the test of what elements are
contained and not contained in the interval.
Now, let's test out the s-expression converters, starting with sexp_of_t. This test
lets you see that a ipped-bounds interval is represented by Empty.
let%expect_test "test to_sexp" =
let t lo hi =
let i = Int_interval.create lo hi in
print_s [%sexp (i : Int_interval.t)]
in
t 3 6;
[%expect {| (Range 3 6) |}];
t 4 4;
[%expect {| (Range 4 4) |}];
t 6 3;
[%expect {| Empty |}]
The next thing to check is the t_of_sexp converters, and here, we run into a problem.
In particular, consider what would happen if we create an interval from the s-expression
(Range 6 3). That's an s-expression that shouldn't ever be generated by the library,
since intervals should never have swapped bounds. But there's nothing to stop us from
generating that s-expression by hand.
let%expect_test "test (range 6 3)" =
let i = Int_interval.t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "(Range 6 3)") in
test_interval i (List.range 1 10);
[%expect
{|
non-empty
in:
out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |}]
You can see something bad has happened, since this interval is detected as non-
empty, but doesn't appear to contain anything. The problem traces back to the fact
that t_of_sexp doesn't check the same invariant that create does. We can x this, by
overriding the auto-generated s-expression converter with one that checks the invariant,
in this case, by calling create.
let t_of_sexp sexp =
match t_of_sexp sexp with
| Empty -> Empty
| Range (x, y) -> create x y
Overriding an existing function denition with a new one is perfectly acceptable in
OCaml. Since t_of_sexp is dened with an ordinary let rather than a let rec, the
call to the t_of_sexp goes to the derived version of the function, rather than being a
recursive call.

382
Data Serialization with S-Expressions
Note that, rather than xing up the invariant, we could have instead thrown an
exception if the invariant was violated. In any case, the approach we took means that
rerunning our test produces a more consistent and sensible result.
let%expect_test "test (range 6 3)" =
let i = Int_interval.t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "(Range 6 3)") in
test_interval i (List.range 1 10);
[%expect
{|
empty
in:
out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |}]
21.4
Getting Good Error Messages
There are two steps to deserializing a type from an s-expression: rst, converting the
bytes in a le to an s-expression; and the second, converting that s-expression into the
type in question. One problem with this is that it can be hard to localize errors to the
right place using this scheme. Consider the following example.
open Core
type t =
{ a : string
; b : int
; c : float option
}
[@@deriving sexp]
let () =
let t = Sexp.load_sexp "example.scm" |> t_of_sexp in
printf "b is: %d\n%!" t.b
If you were to run this on a malformatted le, say, this one:
((a not-a-string)
(b not-a-string)
(c 1.0))
you'll get the following error. (Note that we set the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable
to suppress the stack trace here.)
$ OCAMLRUNPARAM=b=0 dune exec -- ./read_foo.exe
Uncaught exception:
(Of_sexp_error "int_of_sexp: (Failure int_of_string)"
(invalid_sexp not-a-string))
[2]
If all you have is the error message and the string, it's not terribly informative. In
particular, you know that the parsing errored out on the atom not-an-integer, but
you don't know which one! In a large le, this kind of bad error message can be pure
misery.

21.5 @sexp.opaque
383
But there's hope! We can make a small change to the code to improve the error
message greatly:
open Core
type t =
{ a : string
; b : int
; c : float option
}
[@@deriving sexp]
let () =
let t = Sexp.load_sexp_conv_exn "example.scm" t_of_sexp in
printf "b is: %d\n%!" t.b
If we run it again, we'll see a more informative error.
$ OCAMLRUNPARAM=b=0 dune exec -- ./read_foo.exe
Uncaught exception:
(Of_sexp_error example.scm:2:4 "int_of_sexp: (Failure
int_of_string)"
(invalid_sexp not-an-integer))
[2]
Here, example.scm:2:5 tells us that the error occurred in the le "example.scm" on
line 2, character 5. This is a much better start for guring out what went wrong. The
ability to nd the precise location of the error depends on the sexp converter reporting
errors using the function of_sexp_error. This is already done by converters generated
by ppx_sexp_conv, but you should make sure to do the same when you write custom
converters.
21.5
Sexp-Conversion Directives
ppx_sexp_conv supports a collection of directives for modifying the default behavior
of the auto-generated sexp converters. These directives allow you to customize the
way in which types are represented as s-expressions without having to write a custom
converter.
21.5.1
@sexp.opaque
The most commonly used directive is [@sexp_opaque], whose purpose is to mark
a given component of a type as being unconvertible. Anything marked with the
[@sexp.opaque] attribute will be presented as the atom <opaque> by the to-sexp
converter, and will trigger an exception from the from-sexp converter.
Note that the type of a component marked as opaque doesn't need to have a sexp
converter dened. By default, if we dene a type without a sexp converter and then try
to use it as part of another type with a sexp converter, we'll error out:

384
Data Serialization with S-Expressions
# type no_converter = int * int;;
type no_converter = int * int
# type t = { a: no_converter; b: string } [@@deriving sexp];;
Line 1, characters 15-27:
Error: Unbound value no_converter_of_sexp
But with [@sexp.opaque], we can embed our opaque no_converter type within the
other data structure without an error.
type t =
{ a: (no_converter [@sexp.opaque]);
b: string
} [@@deriving sexp];;
And if we now convert a value of this type to an s-expression, we'll see the contents of
eld a marked as opaque:
# sexp_of_t { a = (3,4); b = "foo" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a <opaque>) (b foo))
Note that t_of_sexp is still generated, but will fail at runtime when called.
# t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "((a whatever) (b foo))");;
Exception:
(Of_sexp_error "opaque_of_sexp: cannot convert opaque values"
(invalid_sexp whatever))
It might seem perverse to create a parser for a type containing a [@sexp.opaque]
value, but it's not as useless as it seems. In particular, such a converter won't necessarily
fail on all inputs. Consider a record containing a list of opaque values:
type t =
{ a: (no_converter [@sexp.opaque]) list;
b: string
} [@@deriving sexp];;
The t_of_sexp function can still succeed, as long as the list is empty.
# t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "((a ()) (b foo))");;
- : t = {a = []; b = "foo"}
Sometimes, though, one or other of the converters is useless, and you want to
explicitly choose what to generate. You can do that by using [@@deriving sexp_of]
or [@@deriving of_sexp] instead of [@@deriving sexp].
21.5.2
@sexp.list
Sometimes, sexp converters have more parentheses than one would ideally like. Con-
sider the following variant type.
type compatible_versions =
| Specific of string list
| All
[@@deriving sexp];;
Here's what the concrete syntax looks like.

21.5 Specifying Defaults
385
# sexp_of_compatible_versions
(Specific ["3.12.0"; "3.12.1"; "3.13.0"]);;
- : Sexp.t = (Specific (3.12.0 3.12.1 3.13.0))
The set of parens around the list of versions is arguably excessive. We can drop
those parens using the [@sexp.list] directive.
type compatible_versions =
| Specific of string list [@sexp.list]
| All [@@deriving sexp]
And here's the resulting lighter syntax.
# sexp_of_compatible_versions
(Specific ["3.12.0"; "3.12.1"; "3.13.0"]);;
- : Sexp.t = (Specific 3.12.0 3.12.1 3.13.0)
21.5.3
@sexp.option
By default, optional values are represented either as () for None. Here's an example of
a record type containing an option:
type t =
{ a: int option;
b: string;
} [@@deriving sexp]
And here's what the concrete syntax looks like.
# sexp_of_t { a = None; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a ()) (b hello))
# sexp_of_t { a = Some 3; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a (3)) (b hello))
This all works as you might expect, but in the context of a record, you might want
a dierent behavior, which is to make the eld itself optional. The [@sexp.option]
directive gives you just that.
type t =
{ a: int option [@sexp.option];
b: string;
} [@@deriving sexp]
And here is the new syntax. Note that when the value of a is Some, it shows up in the
s-expression unadorned, and when it's None, the entire record eld is omitted.
# sexp_of_t { a = Some 3; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a 3) (b hello))
# sexp_of_t { a = None; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((b hello))
21.5.4
Specifying Defaults
[@sexp.option] gives you a way of interpreting the s-expression for a record where
some of the elds are left unspecied. The [@default] directive provides another.

386
Data Serialization with S-Expressions
Consider the following type, which represents the conguration of a very simple
web server:
type http_server_config = {
web_root: string;
port: int;
addr: string;
} [@@deriving sexp];;
One could imagine making some of these parameters optional; in particular, by
default, we might want the web server to bind to port 80, and to listen as localhost. We
can do this as follows:
type http_server_config = {
web_root: string;
port: int [@default 80];
addr: string [@default "localhost"];
} [@@deriving sexp];;
Now, if we try to convert an s-expression that species only the web_root, we'll see
that the other values are lled in with the desired defaults:
# let cfg =
"((web_root /var/www/html))"
|> Sexp.of_string
|> http_server_config_of_sexp;;
val cfg : http_server_config =
{web_root = "/var/www/html"; port = 80; addr = "localhost"}
If we convert the conguration back out to an s-expression, you'll notice that all of
the elds are present, even though they're not strictly necessary:
# sexp_of_http_server_config cfg;;
- : Sexp.t = ((web_root /var/www/html) (port 80) (addr localhost))
We could make the generated s-expression also drop default values, by using the
[@sexp_drop_default] directive:
type http_server_config = {
web_root: string;
port: int [@default 80] [@sexp_drop_default.equal];
addr: string [@default "localhost"] [@sexp_drop_default.equal];
} [@@deriving sexp];;
And here's an example of it in action:
# let cfg =
"((web_root /var/www/html))"
|> Sexp.of_string
|> http_server_config_of_sexp;;
val cfg : http_server_config =
{web_root = "/var/www/html"; port = 80; addr = "localhost"}
# sexp_of_http_server_config cfg;;
- : Sexp.t = ((web_root /var/www/html))
As you can see, the elds that are at their default values are omitted from the
generated s-expression. On the other hand, if we convert a cong with non-default
values, they will show up in the generated s-expression.

21.5 Specifying Defaults
387
# sexp_of_http_server_config { cfg with port = 8080 };;
- : Sexp.t = ((web_root /var/www/html) (port 8080))
# sexp_of_http_server_config
{ cfg with port = 8080; addr = "192.168.0.1" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((web_root /var/www/html) (port 8080) (addr 192.168.0.1))
This can be very useful in designing cong le formats that are both reasonably terse
and easy to generate and maintain. It can also be useful for backwards compatibility: if
you add a new eld to your cong record but make that eld optional, then you should
still be able to parse older versions of your cong.
The exact attribute you use depends on the comparison functions available over the
type that you wish to drop:
• [@sexp_drop_default.compare] if the type supports [%compare]
• [@sexp_drop_default.equal] if the type supports [%equal]
• [@sexp_drop_default.sexp] if you want to compare the sexp representations
• [@sexp_drop_default f] and give an explicit equality function
Most of the type denitions supplied with Base and Core provide the comparison
and equality operations, so those are reasonable default attributes to use.

The OCaml Platform
So far in Part II, we've gone through a number of libraries and techniques you can
use to build larger scale OCaml programs. We'll now wrap up this part by examining
the tools you can use for editing, compiling, testing, documenting and publishing your
own projects.
The OCaml community has developed a suite of modern tools to interface it with
IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, and to generate API documentation and implement
modern software engineering practices such as continuous integration (CI) and unit
or fuzz testing. All you need to do is to specify your project metadata (for example,
library dependencies and compiler versions), and the OCaml Platform tools that we'll
describe next will do much of the heavy lifting.
Using the Opam Source-Based Package Manager
opam is the ocial package manager and metadata packaging format that is used in the
OCaml community. We've been using it in earlier chapters to install OCaml libraries,
and we're going to take a closer look at how to use opam within a full project next.
You've almost certainly done this already at this point in the book, but in case you've
skipped straight to this chapter make sure you rst initialize opam's global state.
$ opam init
By default, opam doesn't require any special user permissions and stores all of the
les it installs in ~/.opam, such as the current build of the OCaml compiler if you didn't
have one pre-installed when you initialized opam.
You can maintain multiple development environments with dierent packages and
compilers installed, each of which is called a switch  the default one can be
found under ~/.opam/default. Run opam switch to see all the dierent sandboxed
environments you have available:
$ opam switch
#
switch
compiler
description
default
ocaml.4.13.1

22.1 Choosing an OCaml Compiler Version
389
22.1
A Hello World OCaml Project
Let's start by creating a sample OCaml project and navigating around it. Dune has a
basic built-in command to initialize a project template that is suitable to get us started.
$ dune init proj hello
Success: initialized project component named hello
Dune will create a hello/ directory and populate it with a skeleton OCaml project.
This sample project has the basic metadata required for us to learn more about the
opam package manager and the dune build tool that we've used earlier in the book.
22.1.1
Setting Up an Opam Local Switch
The next thing we need is a suitable environment for this project, with dune and any
other library dependencies available. The best way to do this is to create a new opam
sandbox, via the opam switch create command. If you specify a project directory
argument to this command, then it creates a local switch that stores all the dependen-
cies within that directory rather than under ~/.opam. This is a convenient way to keep
all your build dependencies and source code in one place on your lesystem.
Let's make a local switch for our hello world project now:
$ cd hello
$ opam switch create .
This invokes opam to install the project dependencies (in this case, just the OCaml
compiler and dune as we didn't specify any more when initializing the project). All of
the les from the local switch will be present under _opam/ in the working directory.
You can nd the dune binary that was just compiled inside that directory, for example:
$ ./_opam/bin/dune --version
3.0.2
Since opam will install other binaries and libraries in the local switch as your project
grows, you will need to add the switch to your command-line path. You can use opam
env to add the right directories to your local shell path so that you can invoke the locally
installed tools:
$ eval $(opam env)
If you prefer not to modify your shell conguration, then you can also invoke
commands via opam exec to modify the path for the subcommand specied in the
remainder of the command line.
$ opam exec -- dune build
This executes dune build with the opam environment variables added to the com-
mand invocation, so it will pick up the locally built dune from your project. The double
dash in the command line is a common Unix convention that tells opam to stop pars-
ing its own optional arguments for the remainder of the command, so that they don't
interfere with the command that is being executed.

390
The OCaml Platform
22.1.2
Choosing an OCaml Compiler Version
When creating a switch, opam analyses the project dependencies and selects the newest
OCaml compiler that is compatible with them. Sometimes though, you will want to
select a specic version of the OCaml compiler, perhaps to ensure reproducibility or
to use a particular feature. You can use opam switch list-available to get a full list
of all the compilers that are available.
ocaml-system
4.13.1
The OCaml compiler
(system version, from outside
of opam)
ocaml-base-compiler
4.13.1
Official release 4.13.1
ocaml-variants
4.13.1+options
Official release of OCaml 4.13.1
You'll nd many more versions present than the snippet above, but notice that there
are three dierent types of OCaml compiler packages present.
ocaml-system is the name opam uses for the pre-existing version of the OCaml
compiler that was already installed on your machine. This compiler is always fast to
install since nothing needs to be compiled for it. The only thing needed to create a
system switch is to have the right version of OCaml already installed (e.g. via apt
or Homebrew) and to pass the same version to the switch creation as an additional
argument.
For example, if you have OCaml 4.13.1 installed, then running this command will
use the system compiler:
$ opam switch create . 4.13.1
On the other hand, if you didn't have that system compiler installed, then the
compiler will need to be built from scratch. The command above would select the
ocaml-base-compiler package in this case, which contains the full OCaml compiler
source code. It will take a little longer than ocaml-system, but you have much more
exibility about the choice of versions. The default operation of opam switch create
is to calculate the latest supported compiler version from your project metadata and
use that one for the local switch.
If you always want to locally install a particular compiler, then you can rene the
package description:
$ opam switch create . ocaml-base-compiler.4.13.1
Sometimes, you will also need to add custom conguration options to the compiler,
such as the flambda optimiser. There are two packages that handle this: ocaml-variants
is a package that detects the presence of various ocaml-option packages to activate
conguration ags. For example, to build a compiler with flambda, you would:
$ opam switch create . ocaml-variants.4.13.1+options
ocaml-option-flambda
You can specify multiple ocaml-option packages to cover all the customization
your project needs. See the full set of option packages by using:
$ opam search ocaml-option

22.1 Dening Libraries as Collections of Modules
391
22.1.3
Structure of an OCaml Project
Back in Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and Programs), we looked at what a simple program
with a couple of OCaml modules looks like. Let's now look at the set of les in our
hello/ application to examine a fuller project structure.
.
|-- dune-project
|-- hello.opam
|-- lib
|
|-- dune
|-- bin
|
|-- dune
|
`-- main.ml
`-- test
|-- dune
`-- hello.ml
Some observations about this structure:
• The dune-project le marks the root of the project, and is used for writing down
some key metadata for the project (more on that later).
• The hello.opam le contains metadata for registering this software as an opam
project. As we'll see, we won't need to edit this manually because we can generate
the le via dune.
• There are three source directories, each with its own dune le specifying the build
parameters for that part of the codebase. The trio of lib, bin and test makes
good sense for a project that is primarily an executable, rather than a reusable
library. In that case, you would might use these directories as follows:
 The lib directory would contain the bulk of the source.
 The bin directory would contain a thin wrapper on top of the code in lib which
actually launches the executable.
 The test directory has the bulk of the tests for lib, which, following the advice
in Chapter 18.1.2 (Where Should Tests Go?), are in a separate directory
from the source.
Now we'll talk about the dierent parts of this structure in more detail.
22.1.4
Dening Module Names
A matching pair of ml and mli les dene an OCaml module, named after the le and
capitalized. Module names are the only kind of name you refer to within OCaml code.
Let's create a Msg module in our skeleton project inside lib/.
$ echo 'let greeting = "Hello World"' > lib/msg.ml
$ echo 'val greeting : string' > lib/msg.mli
A valid OCaml module name cannot contain dashes or other special characters other
than underscores. If you need to refresh your memory about how les and modules
interact, refer back to Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and Programs).

392
The OCaml Platform
22.1.5
Dening Libraries as Collections of Modules
One or more OCaml modules can be gathered together into a library, providing a
convenient way to package up multiple dependencies with a single name. A project
usually puts the business logic of the application into a library rather than directly
into an executable binary, since this makes writing tests and documentation easier in
addition to improving reusability.
Libraries are dened by putting a dune le into a directory, such as the one generated
for us in lib/dune:
(library
(name hello))
Dune will treat all OCaml modules in that directory as being part of the hello library
(this behavior can be overridden by a modules eld for more advanced projects). By
default, dune also exposes libraries as wrapped under a single OCaml module, and the
name eld determines the name of that module.
In our example project, msg.ml is dened in lib/dune which denes a hello library.
Thus, users of our newly dened module can access it as Hello.Msg. You can read
more about wrapping and module aliases in Chapter 26.4.4 (Wrapping Libraries with
Module Aliases). Although our hello library only currently contains a single Msg
module, it is common to have multiple modules per library in larger projects. Other
modules within the hello library can simply refer to Msg.
You must refer to library names in a dune le when deciding what libraries to
link in, and never individual module names. You can query the installed libraries
in your current switch via ocamlfind list at your command prompt, after running
opam install ocamlfind to install it if necessary:
$ ocamlfind list
afl-persistent
(version: 1.2)
alcotest
(version: 1.5.0)
alcotest.engine
(version: 1.5.0)
alcotest.stdlib_ext (version: 1.5.0)
angstrom
(version: 0.15.0)
asn1-combinators
(version: 0.2.6)
...
If there's a public_name eld present in the dune library denition, this determines
the publicly exposed name for the library. The public library name is what you specify
via the libraries eld in other projects that use your project's libraries. Without
a public name, the dened library is local to the current dune project only. The
(libraries) eld in the lib/dune le is empty since this is a trivial standalone library.
22.1.6
Writing Test Cases for a Library
Our next step is to dene a test case in test/dune for our library. In Chapter 18
(Testing), we showed you how to embed tests within a library, using the inline test
mechanism. In this section, we'll show you how to use dune's test stanza to create a
test-only executable, which is useful when you're not using inline tests.

22.1 Building an Executable Program
393
Let's start by writing a test as a simple assertion in test/hello.ml.
let () = assert (String.equal Hello.Msg.greeting "Hello World")
We can use the test dune stanza to build an executable binary that is run when you
invoke dune runtest (along with any inline tests dened within libraries). We'll also
add a dependency on our locally dened hello library so that we can access it. The
test/dune le looks like this:
(test
(libraries hello)
(name hello))
Once you run the tests via dune runtest, you can nd the built artifacts in
_build/default/test/ in your project checkout.
$ ls -la _build/default/test
total 992
drwxr-xr-x
7 avsm
staff
224 27 Feb 16:13 .

1 avsm
staff
64 27 Feb 16:13 hello.ml
-r--r--r--
1 avsm
staff
28 27 Feb 15:23 hello.mli
We deliberately dened two les called hello.ml in both lib/ and test/. It's
completely ne to dene an executable hello.exe (in test/) alongside the OCaml
library called hello (in lib/).
22.1.7
Building an Executable Program
Finally, we want to actually use our hello world from the command-line. This is dened
in bin/dune in a very similar fashion to test cases.
(executable
(public_name hello)
(name main)
(libraries hello)))
There has to be a bin/main.ml alongside the bin/dune le that represents the entry
module for the executable. Only that module and the modules and libraries it depends
on will be linked into the executable. Much like libraries, the (name) eld here has to
adhere to OCaml module naming conventions, and the public_name eld represents
the binary name that is installed onto the system and just needs to be a valid Unix or
Windows lename.
Now try modifying bin/main.ml to refer to our Hello.Msg module:
let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting
You can build and execute the command locally using dune exec and the
local name of the executable. You can also nd the built executable in
_build/default/bin/main.exe.

394
The OCaml Platform
$ dune build
$ dune exec -- bin/main.exe
Hello World
You can also refer to the public name of the executable if it's more convenient.
$ dune exec -- hello
Hello World
The dune exec and opam exec command we mentioned earlier in the chapter both
nest, so you could append them to each other using the double-dash directive to separate
them.
$ opam exec -- dune exec -- hello --args
This is quite a common thing to do when integrating with continuous integration
systems that need systematic scripting of both opam and dune (a topic we'll come to
shortly in this chapter).
22.2
Setting Up an Integrated Development Environment
Now that we've seen the basic structure of the OCaml project, it's time to setup an
integrated development environment. An IDE is particularly useful for OCaml because
it lets you leverage the information that's extracted by OCaml's rich type-system. A
good IDE will provide you with the facilities to browse interface documentation, see
inferred types for code, and to jump to the denitions of external modules.
22.2.1
Using Visual Studio Code
The recommended IDE for newcomers to OCaml is Visual Studio Code1 using the
OCaml Platform plugin2. The plugin uses the Language Server Protocol to communi-
cate with your opam and dune environment. All you need to do is to install the OCaml
LSP server via opam:
opam install ocaml-lsp-server
Once installed, the VSCode OCaml plugin will ask you which opam switch to use.
Just the default one should be sucient to get you going with building and browsing
your interfaces.
What Is The Language Server Protocol?
The Language Server Protocol denes a communications standard between an editor
or IDE and a language-specic server that provides features such as auto-completion,
denition search, reference indexing and other facilities that require specialized support
from language tooling. This allows a programming language toolchain to implement
all this functionality just once, and then integrate cleanly into the multiplicity of
1 https://code.visualstudio.com
2 https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform

22.2 Browsing Interface Documentation
395
IDE environments available these days  and even go beyond conventional desktop
environments to web-based notebooks such as Jupyter.
Since OCaml has a complete and mature LSP server, you'll nd that an increasing
number of IDEs will just support it out of the box once you install the ocaml-lsp-server.
It integrates automatically with the various tools we've used in this book, such as
detecting opam switches, invoking dune rules, and so on.
22.2.2
Browsing Interface Documentation
The OCaml LSP server understands how to interface with dune and examine the build
artifacts (such as the typed .cmt interface les), so opening your local project in VS
Code is sucient to activate all the features. Try navigating over to bin/main.ml, where
you will see the invocation to the hello library.
let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting
First perform a build of the project to generate the type annotation les. Then
hover your mouse over the Hello.Msg.greeting function  you should see some
documentation pop up about the function and its arguments. This information comes
from the docstrings written into the msg.mli interface le in the hello library.
Modify the msg.mli interface le to contain some signature documentation as
follows:
(** This is a docstring, as it starts with "**", as opposed to normal
comments that start with a single star.
The top-most docstring of the module should contain a description
of the module, what it does, how to use it, etc.
The function-specific documentation located below the function
signatures. *)
(** This is the docstring for the [greeting] function.
A typical documentation for this function would be:
Returns a greeting message.
{4 Examples}
{[ print_endline greeting ]} *)
val greeting : string
Documentation strings are parsed by the odoc3 tool to generate HTML and PDF
documentation from a collection of opam packages. If you intend your code to be used
by anyone else (or indeed, by yourself a few months later) you should take the time to
annotate your OCaml signature les with documentation. An easy way to preview the
HTML documentation is to build it locally with dune:
3 https://github.com/ocaml/odoc

396
The OCaml Platform
$ opam install odoc
$ dune build @doc
This will leave the HTML les in _build/default/_doc/_html, which you can
view normally with a web browser.
22.2.3
Autoformatting Your Source Code
As you develop more OCaml code, you'll nd it convenient to have it formatted to a
common style. The ocamlformat tool can help you do this easily from within VSCode.
$ echo 'version=0.20.1' > .ocamlformat
$ opam install ocamlformat.0.20.1
The .ocamlformat le controls the autoformatting options available, and xes the
version of the tool that is used. You can upgrade to a newer ocamlformat version when-
ever you want, but it is a manual process to avoid an upstream release auto-reformatting
your project code without your intervention. You can examine the formatting options
via ocamlformat --help  most of the time the defaults should be ne.
Once you've got ocamlformat congured, you can either format your project from
within VSCode (shift-alt-F being the default), or by running:
$ dune build @fmt
This will generate a set of reformatted les in the build directory, which you can
accept with dune promote as you did earlier in the testing chapter.
22.3
Publishing Your Code Online
With your IDE all set up you'll quickly develop useful OCaml code and want to share
it with others. We'll now go through how to dene opam packages, set up continuous
integration and publish your code.
22.3.1
Dening Opam Packages
The only metadata le that is really required to participate in the open-source OCaml
ecosystem is an opam le in your source tree. Each opam le denes a package  a
collection of OCaml libraries and executable binaries or application data. Each opam
package can dene dependencies on other opam packages, and includes build and
testing directions for your project. This is what's installed when you eventually publish
the package and someone else types in opam install hello.
A collection of opam les can be stored in an opam repository to create a pack-
age database, with a central one for the OCaml ecosystem available at https:
//github.com/ocaml/opam-repository. The ocial (but not exclusive) tool used
for manipulating opam les is the eponymous opam package manager4 that we've been
using throughout this book.
4 https://opam.ocaml.org

22.3 Generating Project Metadata from Dune
397
How Do We Name OCaml Modules, Libraries and Packages?
Much of the time, the module, library, and package names are all the same. But there
are reasons for these names to be distinct as well:
• Some libraries are exposed as multiple top-level modules, which means you need a
dierent name for that collection of modules.
• Even when the library has a single top-level module, you might want the library
name to be dierent from the module name to avoid name clashes at the library
level.
• Package names might dier from library names if a package combines multiple
libraries and/or binaries together.
It's important to understand the dierence between modules, libraries and packages
as you work on bigger projects. These can easily have thousands of modules, hundreds
of libraries and dozens of opam packages in a single codebase.
22.3.2
Generating Project Metadata from Dune
The hello.opam le in our sample project is currently empty, but you don't need to
write it by hand  instead, we can dene our project metadata using the dune build
system and have the opam le autogenerated for us. The root directory of an OCaml
project built by dune has a dune-project le that denes the project metadata. In our
example project, it starts with:
(lang dune 3.0)
The line above is the version of the syntax used in your build les, and not the actual
version of the dune binary. One of the nicest features of dune is that it is forwards-
compatible with older metadata. By dening the version of the dune language that you
are currently using, future versions of dune will do their best to emulate the current
behavior until you choose to upgrade your project.
The rest of the dune-project le denes other useful project metadata:
(name hello)
(documentation "https://username.github.io/hello/")
(source (github username/hello))
(license ISC)
(authors "Your name")
(maintainers "Your name")
(generate_opam_files true)
The elds in here all represent project metadata ranging from textual descriptions,
to project URLs, to other opam package dependencies. Go ahead and edit the metadata
above to reect your own details, and then build the project:
$ dune build
The build command will update the hello.opam le in your source tree as well,
keeping it in sync with your changes. The nal part of the dune-project le contains
dependency information for other packages your project depends on.

398
The OCaml Platform
(package
(name hello)
(synopsis "A short description of the project")
(description "A short description of the project")
(depends
(ocaml (>= 4.08.0))
(alcotest :with-test)
(odoc :with-doc)))
The (package) stanza here refers to opam packages, both for the name and for the
dependency specications. This is in contrast to the dune les which refer to ocamlnd
libraries, since those represent the compilation units for OCaml code (whereas opam
packages are broader collections of package data).
Notice that the dependency specication can also include version information. One
of the key features of opam is that each repository contains multiple versions of
the same package. The opam CLI contains a constraint solver that will nd versions
of all dependencies that are compatible with your current project. When you add a
dependency, you can therefore specify lower and upper version bounds as required by
your use of that package. The with-test and with-doc are further constraints that only
add those dependencies for test and documentation generation respectively.
Once you've dened your opam and dune dependencies, you can run various lint
commands to check that your metadata is consistent.
$ opam dune-lint
$ opam lint
The opam-dune-lint plugin will check that the ocamlnd libraries and opam pack-
ages in your dune les match up, and oer to x them up if it spots a mismatch.
opam lint runs additional checks on the opam les within your project.
22.3.3
Setting up Continuous Integration
Once you have your project metadata dened, it's a good time to begin hosting it online.
Two of the most popular platforms for this are GitHub5 and GitLab6. The remainder
of this chapter will assume you are using GitHub for simplicity, although you are
encouraged to check out the alternatives to nd the best solution for your own needs.
When you create a GitHub repository and push your code to it, you can also add an
OCaml GitHub Action that will install the OCaml Platform tools and run your code
across various architectures and operating systems. You can nd the full documentation
online at the Set up OCaml7 page on the GitHub marketplace. Conguring an action
is as simple as adding a .github/workflows/test.yml le to your project that looks
something like this:
name: Hello world workflow
on:
pull_request:
5 https://github.com
6 https://gitlab.com
7 https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-up-ocaml

This workow le will run your project on OCaml installations on Windows, macOS
and Linux, using the latest patch release of OCaml 4.13. Notice that it also runs the test
cases you have dened earlier on all those dierent operating systems as well. You can
do an awful lot of customization of these continuous integration workows, so refer to
the online documentation for more options.
22.3.4
Other Conventions
There are a few other les you may also want to add to a project to match common
conventions:
• A Makefile contains targets for common actions such as all, build, test or clean.
While you don't need this when using VSCode, some other operating system
package managers might benet from having one present.
• The LICENSE denes the terms under which your code is made available. Our example
defaults to the permissive ISC license, and this is generally a safe default unless
you have specic plans for your project.
• A README.md is a Markdown-formatted introduction to your library or application.
• A .gitignore le contains the patterns for generated les from the OCaml tools
so that they can be ignored by the Git version control software. If you're not
familiar with using Git, look over one of the tutorials one such as GitHub's git
hello world8.

The OCaml Platform
22.3.5
Releasing Your Code into the Opam Repository
Once your continuous integration is passing, you are all set to try to tag a release of
your project and share it with other users! The OCaml Platform supplies a convenient
tool called dune-release which automates much of this process for you.
$ opam install dune-release
The rst thing you need to do is to create a CHANGES.md le in your project in
Markdown format, which contains a header per version. This is typically a succinct
summary of the changes between versions that can be read by users. For our rst
release, we might have:
## v1.0.0
- Initial public release of our glorious hello world
project (@avsm)
- Added test cases for making sure we do in fact hello world.
Commit this le to your repository in the root. Before you proceed with a release,
you need to make sure that all of your local changes have been pushed to the remote
GitHub repository, and that your working tree is clean. You can do this by using git:
$ git clean -dxf
$ git diff
This will remove any untracked les from the local checkout (such as the _build
directory) and check that tracked les are unmodied. We should now be ready to
perform the release! First create a git tag to mark this release:
$ dune-release tag
This will parse your CHANGES.md le and gure out the latest version, and create a
local git tag in your repository after prompting you. Once that succeeds, you can start
the release process via:
$ dune-release
This will begin an interactive session where you will need to enter some GitHub
authentication details (via creating a personal access token). Once that is completed,
the tool will run all local tests, generate documentation and upload it to your GitHub
pages branch for that project, and nally oer to open a pull request to the central opam-
repository. Recall that the central opam package set is all just a normal git repository,
and so your opam le will be added to that and your GitHub account will create a PR.
At this point, you can sit back and relax while the central opam repository test system
runs your package through a battery of installations (including on exotic architectures
you might not access to, such as S390X mainframes or 32-bit ARMv7). If there
is a problem detected, some friendly maintainers from the OCaml community will
comment on the pull request and guide you through how to address it. You can simply
delete the git tag and re-run the release process until the package is merged. Once it is
merged, you can navigate to the <ocaml.org> site and view it online in an hour or so.
It will also be available in the central repository for other users to install.

Creating Lock Files for Your Projects
Before you publish a project, you might also want to create an opam lock le to
include with the archive. A lock le records the exact versions of all the transitive
opam dependencies at the time you generate it. All you need to do is to run:
$ opam lock
This generates a pkgname.opam.locked le which contains the same metadata as
your original le, but with all the dependencies explicitly listed. Later on, if a user
wants to reconstruct your exact opam environment (as opposed to the package solution
they might calculate with a future opam repository), then they can pass an option
during installation:
$ opam install pkgname --locked
$ opam switch create . --locked
Lock les are an optional but useful step to take when releasing your project to the
Internet.

Part III
The Compiler and Runtime
System
Part III discusses OCaml's runtime system and compiler toolchain. It is remarkably
simple when compared to some other language implementations (such as Java's or
.NET's CLR). Reading this part will enable you to build very-high-performance sys-
tems, or to interface with C libraries. This is also where we talk about proling and
debugging techniques using tools such as GNU gdb.

Foreign Function Interface
This chapter includes contributions from Jeremy Yallop.
OCaml has several options available to interact with non-OCaml code. The compiler
can link with external system libraries via C code and also can produce standalone
native object les that can be embedded within other non-OCaml applications.
The mechanism by which code in one programming language can invoke routines
in a dierent programming language is called a foreign function interface. This chapter
will:
• Show how to call routines in C libraries directly from your OCaml code
• Teach you how to build higher-level abstractions in OCaml from the low-level C
bindings
• Work through some full examples for binding a terminal interface and UNIX date/-
time functions
The simplest foreign function interface in OCaml doesn't even require you to write
any C code at all! The Ctypes library lets you dene the C interface in pure OCaml, and
the library then takes care of loading the C symbols and invoking the foreign function
call.
Let's dive straight into a realistic example to show you how the library looks. We'll
create a binding to the Ncurses terminal toolkit, as it's widely available on most systems
and doesn't have any complex dependencies.
Installing the Ctypes Library
If you want to use Ctypes interactively, you'll also need to install the libffi library as
a prerequisite to using Ctypes. It's a fairly popular library and should be available in
your OS package manager. If you're using opam 2.1 or higher, it will prompt you to
install it automatically when you install ctypes-foreign.
$ opam install ctypes ctypes-foreign
$ utop
# require "ctypes-foreign" ;;
You'll also need the Ncurses library for the rst example. This comes preinstalled
on many operating systems such as macOS, and Debian Linux provides it as the
libncurses5-dev package.

406
Foreign Function Interface
23.1
Example: A Terminal Interface
Ncurses is a library to help build terminal-independent text interfaces in a reasonably
ecient way. It's used in console mail clients like Mutt and Pine, and console web
browsers such as Lynx.
The full C interface is quite large and is explained in the online documentation1.
We'll just use the small excerpt, since we just want to demonstrate Ctypes in action:
typedef struct _win_st WINDOW;
typedef unsigned int chtype;
WINDOW *initscr
(void);
WINDOW *newwin
(int, int, int, int);
void
endwin
(void);
void
refresh
(void);
void
wrefresh
(WINDOW *);
void
addstr (const char *);
int
mvwaddch
(WINDOW *, int, int, const chtype);
void
mvwaddstr (WINDOW *, int, int, char *);
void
box (WINDOW *, chtype, chtype);
int
cbreak (void);
The Ncurses functions either operate on the current pseudoterminal or on a window
that has been created via newwin. The WINDOW structure holds the internal library state
and is considered abstract outside of Ncurses. Ncurses clients just need to store the
pointer somewhere and pass it back to Ncurses library calls, which in turn dereference
its contents.
Note that there are over 200 library calls in Ncurses, so we're only binding a select
few for this example. The initscr and newwin create WINDOW pointers for the global and
subwindows, respectively. The mvwaddrstr takes a window, x/y osets, and a string
and writes to the screen at that location. The terminal is only updated after refresh or
wrefresh are called.
Ctypes provides an OCaml interface that lets you map these C functions to equivalent
OCaml functions. The library takes care of converting OCaml function calls and
arguments into the C calling convention, invoking the foreign call within the C library
and nally returning the result as an OCaml value.
Let's begin by dening the basic values we need, starting with the WINDOW state
pointer:
open Ctypes
type window = unit ptr
let window : window typ = ptr void
We don't know the internal representation of the window pointer, so we treat it as
a C void pointer. We'll improve on this later on in the chapter, but it's good enough
for now. The second statement denes an OCaml value that represents the WINDOW C
pointer. This value is used later in the Ctypes function denitions:
1 http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/

23.1 Example: A Terminal Interface
407
open Foreign
let initscr = foreign "initscr" (void @-> returning window)
That's all we need to invoke our rst function call to initscr to initialize the
terminal. The foreign function accepts two parameters:
• The C function call name, which is looked up using the dlsym POSIX function.
• A value that denes the complete set of C function arguments and its return type. The
@-> operator adds an argument to the C parameter list, and returning terminates
the parameter list with the return type.
The remainder of the Ncurses binding simply expands on these denitions:
let newwin =
foreign "newwin" (int @-> int @-> int @-> int @-> returning window)
let endwin = foreign "endwin" (void @-> returning void)
let refresh = foreign "refresh" (void @-> returning void)
let wrefresh = foreign "wrefresh" (window @-> returning void)
let addstr = foreign "addstr" (string @-> returning void)
let mvwaddch =
foreign
"mvwaddch"
(window @-> int @-> int @-> char @-> returning void)
let mvwaddstr =
foreign
"mvwaddstr"
(window @-> int @-> int @-> string @-> returning void)
let box = foreign "box" (window @-> char @-> char @-> returning void)
let cbreak = foreign "cbreak" (void @-> returning int)
These denitions are all straightforward mappings from the C declarations in the
Ncurses header le. Note that the string and int values here are nothing to do with
OCaml type declarations; instead, they are values that come from opening the Ctypes
module at the top of the le.
Most of the parameters in the Ncurses example represent fairly simple scalar C
types, except for window (a pointer to the library state) and string, which maps from
OCaml strings that have a specic length onto C character buers whose length is
dened by a terminating null character that immediately follows the string data.
The module signature for ncurses.mli looks much like a normal OCaml signa-
ture. You can infer it directly from the ncurses.ml by running a command called
ocaml-print-intf, which you can install with opam.
$ ocaml-print-intf ncurses.ml
type window = unit Ctypes.ptr
val window : window Ctypes.typ
val initscr : unit -> window
val newwin : int -> int -> int -> int -> window
val endwin : unit -> unit
val refresh : unit -> unit

408
Foreign Function Interface
val wrefresh : window -> unit
val addstr : string -> unit
val mvwaddch : window -> int -> int -> char -> unit
val mvwaddstr : window -> int -> int -> string -> unit
val box : window -> char -> char -> unit
val cbreak : unit -> int
The ocaml-print-intf tool examines the default signature inferred by the compiler
for a module le and prints it out as human-readable output. You can copy this into
a corresponding mli le and customize it to improve its safety for external callers by
making some of its internals more abstract.
Here's the customized ncurses.mli interface that we can safely use from other
libraries:
type window
val window : window Ctypes.typ
val initscr : unit -> window
val endwin : unit -> unit
val refresh : unit -> unit
val wrefresh : window -> unit
val newwin : int -> int -> int -> int -> window
val mvwaddch : window -> int -> int -> char -> unit
val addstr : string -> unit
val mvwaddstr : window -> int -> int -> string -> unit
val box : window -> char -> char -> unit
val cbreak : unit -> int
Note that the window type is now abstract in the signature, to ensure that window
pointers can only be constructed via the Ncurses.initscr function. This prevents
void pointers obtained from other sources from being mistakenly passed to an Ncurses
library call.
Now compile a hello world terminal drawing program to tie this all together:
open Ncurses
let () =
let main_window = initscr () in
ignore (cbreak ());
let small_window = newwin 10 10 5 5 in
mvwaddstr main_window 1 2 "Hello";
mvwaddstr small_window 2 2 "World";
box small_window '\000' '\000';
refresh ();
Unix.sleep 1;
wrefresh small_window;
Unix.sleep 5;
endwin ()
The hello executable is compiled by linking with the ctypes-foreign package. We
also add in a (flags) directive to instruct the compiler to link in the system ncurses
C library to the executable. If you do not specify the C library in the dune le, then
the program may build successfully, but attempting to invoke the executable will fail
as not all of the dependencies will be available.

23.2 Basic Scalar C Types
409
(executable
(name
hello)
(libraries ctypes-foreign)
(flags
:standard -cclib -lncurses))
And now we can build it with Dune.
$ dune build hello.exe
Running hello.exe should now display a Hello World in your terminal!
Ctypes wouldn't be very useful if it were limited to only dening simple C types,
of course. It provides full support for C pointer arithmetic, pointer conversions, and
reading and writing through pointers, using OCaml functions as function pointers to
C code, as well as struct and union denitions.
We'll go over some of these features in more detail for the remainder of the chapter
by using some POSIX date functions as running examples.
Linking Modes: lib and Stub Generation
The core of ctypes is a set of OCaml combinators for describing the structure of C
types (numeric types, arrays, pointers, structs, unions and functions). You can then use
these combinators to describe the types of the C functions that you want to call. There
are two entirely distinct ways to actually link to the system libraries that contain the
function denitions: dynamic linking and stub generation.
The ctypes-foreign package used in this chapter uses the low-level libffi library
to dynamically open C libraries, search for the relevant symbols for the function call
being invoked, and marshal the function parameters according to the operating system's
application binary interface (ABI). While much of this happens behind-the-scenes and
permits convenient interactive programming while developing bindings, it is not always
the solution you want to use in production.
The ctypes-cstubs package provides an alternative mechanism to shift much of the
linking work to be done once at build time, instead of doing it on every invocation of the
function. It does this by taking the same OCaml binding descriptions, and generating
intermediate C source les that contain the corresponding C/OCaml glue code. When
these are compiled with a normal dune build, the generated C code is treated just
as any handwritten code might be, and compiled against the system header les. This
allows certain C values to be used that cannot be dynamically probed (e.g. preprocessor
macro denitions), and can also catch denition errors if there is a C header mismatch
at compile time.
C rarely makes life easier though. There are some denitions that cannot be entirely
expressed as static C code (e.g. dynamic function pointers), and those require the use
of ctypes-foreign (and libffi). Using ctypes does make it possible to share the
majority of denitions across both linking modes, all while avoiding writing C code
directly.
While we do not cover the details of C stub generation further in this chapter, you can
read more about how to use this mode in the Dealing with foreign libraries chapter
in the dune manual.

Foreign Function Interface
23.2
Basic Scalar C Types
First, let's look at how to dene basic scalar C types. Every C type is represented by
an OCaml equivalent via the single type denition:
type 'a typ
Ctypes.typ is the type of values that represents C types to OCaml. There are two types
associated with each instance of typ:
• The C type used to store and pass values to the foreign library.
• The corresponding OCaml type. The 'a type parameter contains the OCaml type
such that a value of type t typ is used to read and write OCaml values of type t.
There are various other uses of typ values within Ctypes, such as:
• Constructing function types for binding native functions
• Constructing pointers for reading and writing locations in C-managed storage
• Describing component elds of structures, unions, and arrays
Here are the denitions for most of the standard C99 scalar types, including some
platform-dependent ones:
val void
: unit typ
val char
: char typ
val schar
: int typ
val short
: int typ
val int
: int typ
val long
: long typ
val llong
: llong typ
val nativeint : nativeint typ
val int8_t
: int typ
val int16_t
: int typ
val int32_t
: int32 typ
val int64_t
: int64 typ
val uchar
: uchar typ
val uint8_t
: uint8 typ
val uint16_t
: uint16 typ
val uint32_t
: uint32 typ
val uint64_t
: uint64 typ
val size_t
: size_t typ
val ushort
: ushort typ
val uint
: uint typ
val ulong
: ulong typ
val ullong
: ullong typ
val float
: float typ
val double
: float typ
val complex32 : Complex.t typ
val complex64 : Complex.t typ
These values are all of type 'a typ, where the value name (e.g., void) tells you
the C type and the 'a component (e.g., unit) is the OCaml representation of that C

23.3 Pointers and Arrays
411
type. Most of the mappings are straightforward, but some of them need a bit more
explanation:
• Void values appear in OCaml as the unit type. Using void in an argument or
result type specication produces an OCaml function that accepts or returns
unit. Dereferencing a pointer to void is an error, as in C, and will raise the
IncompleteType exception.
• The C size_t type is an alias for one of the unsigned integer types. The actual
size and alignment requirements for size_t varies between platforms. Ctypes
provides an OCaml size_t type that is aliased to the appropriate integer type.
• OCaml only supports double-precision oating-point numbers, and so the C float
and double types both map onto the OCaml float type, and the C float complex
and double complex types both map onto the OCaml double-precision Complex.t
type.
23.3
Pointers and Arrays
Pointers are at the heart of C, so they are necessarily part of Ctypes, which provides sup-
port for pointer arithmetic, pointer conversions, reading and writing through pointers,
and passing and returning pointers to and from functions.
We've already seen a simple use of pointers in the Ncurses example. Let's start a
new example by binding the following POSIX functions:
time_t time(time_t *);
double difftime(time_t, time_t);
char *ctime(const time_t *timep);
The time function returns the current calendar time and is a simple start. The rst
step is to open some of the Ctypes modules:
Ctypes The Ctypes module provides functions for describing C types in OCaml.
PosixTypes The PosixTypes module includes some extra POSIX-specic types (such
as time_t).
Foreign The Foreign module exposes the foreign function that makes it possible to
invoke C functions.
With these opens in place, we can now create a binding to time directly from the
toplevel.
# #require "ctypes-foreign";;
# #require "ctypes.top";;
# open Core;;
# open Ctypes;;
# open PosixTypes ;;
# open Foreign;;
# let time = foreign "time" (ptr time_t @-> returning time_t);;
val time : time_t Ctypes_static.ptr -> time_t = <fun>

412
Foreign Function Interface
The foreign function is the main link between OCaml and C. It takes two arguments:
the name of the C function to bind, and a value describing the type of the bound function.
In the time binding, the function type species one argument of type ptr time_t and
a return type of time_t.
We can now call time immediately in the same toplevel. The argument is actually
optional, so we'll just pass a null pointer that has been coerced into becoming a null
pointer to time_t:
# let cur_time = time (from_voidp time_t null);;
val cur_time : time_t = <abstr>
Since we're going to call time a few times, let's create a wrapper function that passes
the null pointer through:
# let time' () = time (from_voidp time_t null);;
val time' : unit -> time_t = <fun>
Since time_t is an abstract type, we can't actually do anything useful with it directly.
We need to bind a second function to do anything useful with the return values from
time. We'll move on to difftime; the second C function in our prototype list:
# let difftime = foreign "difftime" (time_t @-> time_t @-> returning
double);;
val difftime : time_t -> time_t -> float = <fun>
Here's the resulting function difftime in action.
# let delta =
let t1 = time' () in
Unix.sleep 2;
let t2 = time' () in
difftime t2 t1;;
val delta : float = 2.
The binding to difftime above is sucient to compare two time_t values.
23.3.1
Allocating Typed Memory for Pointers
Let's look at a slightly less trivial example where we pass a nonnull pointer to a
function. Continuing with the theme from earlier, we'll bind to the ctime function,
which converts a time_t value to a human-readable string:
# let ctime = foreign "ctime" (ptr time_t @-> returning string);;
val ctime : time_t Ctypes_static.ptr -> string = <fun>
The binding is continued in the toplevel to add to our growing collection. However,
we can't just pass the result of time to ctime:
# ctime (time' ());;
Line 1, characters 7-17:
Error: This expression has type time_t but an expression was expected
of type
time_t Ctypes_static.ptr = (time_t, [ `C ]) pointer
This is because ctime needs a pointer to the time_t rather than passing it by value.
We thus need to allocate some memory for the time_t and obtain its memory address:

23.3 Using Views to Map Complex Values
413
# let t_ptr = allocate time_t (time' ());;
...
The allocate function takes the type of the memory to be allocated and the initial
value and it returns a suitably typed pointer. We can now call ctime passing the pointer
as an argument:
# ctime t_ptr;;
...
23.3.2
Using Views to Map Complex Values
While scalar types typically have a 1:1 representation, other C types require extra work
to convert them into OCaml. Views create new C type descriptions that have special
behavior when used to read or write C values.
We've already used one view in the denition of ctime earlier. The string view
wraps the C type char * (written in OCaml as ptr char) and converts between the C
and OCaml string representations each time the value is written or read.
Here is the type signature of the Ctypes.view function:
val view :
read:('a -> 'b) ->
write:('b -> 'a) ->
'a typ -> 'b typ
Ctypes has some internal low-level conversion functions that map between an
OCaml string and a C character buer by copying the contents into the respective
data structure. They have the following type signature:
val string_of_char_ptr : char ptr -> string
val char_ptr_of_string : string -> char ptr
Given these functions, the denition of the Ctypes.string value that uses views is
quite simple:
let string =
view (char ptr)
~read:string_of_char_ptr
~write:char_ptr_of_string
The type of this string function is a normal typ with no external sign of the use of
the view function:
val string
: string typ
OCaml Strings Versus C Character Buers
Although OCaml strings may look like C character buers from an interface perspec-
tive, they're very dierent in terms of their memory representations.
OCaml strings are stored in the OCaml heap with a header that explicitly denes
their length. C buers are also xed-length, but by convention, a C string is terminated

414
Foreign Function Interface
by a null (a \0 byte) character. The C string functions calculate their length by scanning
the buer until the rst null character is encountered.
This means that you need to be careful that OCaml strings that you pass to C
functions don't contain any null values, since the rst occurrence of a null character
will be treated as the end of the C string. Ctypes also defaults to a copying interface for
strings, which means that you shouldn't use them when you want the library to mutate
the buer in-place. In that situation, use the Ctypes Bigarray support to pass memory
by reference instead.
23.4
Structs and Unions
The C constructs struct and union make it possible to build new types from existing
types. Ctypes contains counterparts that work similarly.
23.4.1
Dening a Structure
Let's improve the timer function that we wrote earlier. The POSIX function
gettimeofday retrieves the time with microsecond resolution. The signature of
gettimeofday is as follows, including the structure denitions:
struct timeval {
long tv_sec;
long tv_usec;
};
int gettimeofday(struct timeval *, struct timezone *tv);
Using Ctypes, we can describe this type as follows in our toplevel, continuing on
from the previous denitions:
# type timeval;;
type timeval
# let timeval : timeval structure typ = structure "timeval";;
val timeval : timeval structure typ =
Ctypes_static.Struct
{Ctypes_static.tag = "timeval";
spec = Ctypes_static.Incomplete {Ctypes_static.isize = 0}; fields
= []}
The rst command denes a new OCaml type timeval that we'll use to instantiate
the OCaml version of the struct. This is a phantom type that exists only to distinguish
the underlying C type from other pointer types. The particular timeval structure now
has a distinct type from other structures we dene elsewhere, which helps to avoid
getting them mixed up.
The second command calls structure to create a fresh structure type. At this point,
the structure type is incomplete: we can add elds but cannot yet use it in foreign
calls or use it to create values.

23.4 Incomplete Structure Denitions
415
23.4.2
Adding Fields to Structures
The timeval structure denition still doesn't have any elds, so we need to add those
next:
# let tv_sec
= field timeval "tv_sec" long;;
val tv_sec : (Signed.long, timeval structure) field =
{Ctypes_static.ftype = Ctypes_static.Primitive
Ctypes_primitive_types.Long;
foffset = 0; fname = "tv_sec"}
# let tv_usec = field timeval "tv_usec" long;;
val tv_usec : (Signed.long, timeval structure) field =
{Ctypes_static.ftype = Ctypes_static.Primitive
Ctypes_primitive_types.Long;
foffset = 8; fname = "tv_usec"}
# seal timeval;;
- : unit = ()
The field function appends a eld to the structure, as shown with tv_sec and
tv_usec. Structure elds are typed accessors that are associated with a particular
structure, and they correspond to the labels in C.
Every eld addition mutates the structure variable and records a new size (the exact
value of which depends on the type of the eld that was just added). Once we seal
the structure, we will be able to create values using it, but adding elds to a sealed
structure is an error.
23.4.3
Incomplete Structure Denitions
Since gettimeofday needs a struct timezone pointer for its second argument, we
also need to dene a second structure type:
# type timezone;;
type timezone
# let timezone : timezone structure typ = structure "timezone";;
val timezone : timezone structure typ =
Ctypes_static.Struct
{Ctypes_static.tag = "timezone";
spec = Ctypes_static.Incomplete {Ctypes_static.isize = 0}; fields
= []}
We don't ever need to create struct timezone values, so we can leave this struct as
incomplete without adding any elds or sealing it. If you ever try to use it in a situation
where its concrete size needs to be known, the library will raise an IncompleteType
exception.
We're nally ready to bind to gettimeofday now:
# let gettimeofday = foreign "gettimeofday" ~check_errno:true
(ptr timeval @-> ptr timezone @-> returning int);;
val gettimeofday :
timeval structure Ctypes_static.ptr ->
timezone structure Ctypes_static.ptr -> int = <fun>
There's one other new feature here: the returning_checking_errno function be-
haves like returning, except that it checks whether the bound C function modies

416
Foreign Function Interface
the C error ag. Changes to errno are mapped into OCaml exceptions and raise a
Unix.Unix_error exception just as the standard library functions do.
As before, we can create a wrapper to make gettimeofday easier to use. The
functions make, addr, and getf create a structure value, retrieve the address of a
structure value, and retrieve the value of a eld from a structure.
# let gettimeofday' () =
let tv = make timeval in

Float.of_int secs +. Float.of_int usecs /. 1_000_000.0;;
val gettimeofday' : unit -> float = <fun>
And we can now call that function to get the current time.
# gettimeofday' ();;
- : float = 1650045389.278065

Why Do We Need to Use returning?
The alert reader may be curious about why all these function denitions have to be
terminated by returning:
(* correct types *)
val time: ptr time_t @-> returning time_t
val difftime: time_t @-> time_t @-> returning double
The returning function may appear superuous here. Why couldn't we simply give
the types as follows?
(* incorrect types *)
val time: ptr time_t @-> time_t
val difftime: time_t @-> time_t @-> double
The reason involves higher types and two dierences between the way that functions
are treated in OCaml and C. Functions are rst-class values in OCaml, but not in C.
For example, in C it is possible to return a function pointer from a function, but not to
return an actual function.
Secondly, OCaml functions are typically dened in a curried style. The signature of
a two-argument function is written as follows:

418
Foreign Function Interface
val curried : int -> int -> int
but this really means:
val curried : int -> (int -> int)
and the arguments can be supplied one at a time to create a closure. In contrast, C
functions receive their arguments all at once. The equivalent C function type is the
following:
int uncurried_C(int, int);
and the arguments must always be supplied together:
uncurried_C(3, 4);
A C function that's written in curried style looks very dierent:
/* A function that accepts an int, and returns a function
pointer that accepts a second int and returns an int. */
typedef int (function_t)(int);
function_t *curried_C(int);
/* supply both arguments */
curried_C(3)(4);
/* supply one argument at a time */
function_t *f = curried_C(3); f(4);
The OCaml type of uncurried_C when bound by Ctypes is int -> int -> int:
a two-argument function. The OCaml type of curried_C when bound by ctypes is
int -> (int -> int): a one-argument function that returns a one-argument function.
In OCaml, of course, these types are absolutely equivalent. Since the OCaml types
are the same but the C semantics are quite dierent, we need some kind of marker to
distinguish the cases. This is the purpose of returning in function denitions.
23.4.4
Dening Arrays
Arrays in C are contiguous blocks of the same type of value. Any of the basic types
dened previously can be allocated as blocks via the Array module:
module Array : sig
type 'a t = 'a array
val get : 'a t -> int -> 'a
val set : 'a t -> int -> 'a -> unit
val of_list : 'a typ -> 'a list -> 'a t
val to_list : 'a t -> 'a list
val length : 'a t -> int
val start : 'a t -> 'a ptr
val from_ptr : 'a ptr -> int -> 'a t
val make : 'a typ -> ?initial:'a -> int -> 'a t
end
The array functions are similar to those in the standard library Array module except

23.5 Passing Functions to C
419
that they operate on arrays stored using the at C representation rather than the OCaml
representation described in Chapter 24 (Memory Representation of Values).
As with standard OCaml arrays, the conversion between arrays and lists requires
copying the values, which can be expensive for large data structures. Notice that you
can also convert an array into a ptr pointer to the head of the underlying buer, which
can be useful if you need to pass the pointer and size arguments separately to a C
function.
Unions in C are named structures that can be mapped onto the same underlying
memory. They are also fully supported in Ctypes, but we won't go into more detail
here.
Pointer Operators for Dereferencing and Arithmetic
Ctypes denes a number of operators that let you manipulate pointers and arrays just
as you would in C. The Ctypes equivalents do have the benet of being more strongly
typed, of course.
• !@ p will dereference the pointer p.
• p <-@ v will write the value v to the address p.
• p +@ n computes the address of the nth next element, if p points to an array element.
• p -@ n computes the address of the nth previous element, if p points to an array
element.
There are also other useful non-operator functions available (see the Ctypes docu-
mentation), such as pointer dierencing and comparison.
23.5
Passing Functions to C
It's also straightforward to pass OCaml function values to C. The C standard library
function qsort sorts arrays of elements using a comparison function passed in as a
function pointer. The signature for qsort is:
void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,
int(*compar)(const void *, const void *));
C programmers often use typedef to make type denitions involving function
pointers easier to read. Using a typedef, the type of qsort looks a little more palatable:
typedef int(compare_t)(const void *, const void *);
void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, compare_t *);
This also happens to be a close mapping to the corresponding Ctypes denition.
Since type descriptions are regular values, we can just use let in place of typedef and
end up with working OCaml bindings to qsort:
# open Core open Ctypes open PosixTypes open Foreign open
Ctypes_static;;
# let compare_t = ptr void @-> ptr void @-> returning int;;

420
Foreign Function Interface
val compare_t : (unit Ctypes_static.ptr -> unit Ctypes_static.ptr ->
int) fn =
Function (Pointer Void,
Function (Pointer Void, Returns (Primitive
Ctypes_primitive_types.Int)))
# let qsort =
foreign "qsort"
(ptr void @-> size_t @-> size_t @-> funptr compare_t
@-> returning void);;
val qsort :
unit Ctypes_static.ptr ->
size_t ->
size_t -> (unit Ctypes_static.ptr -> unit Ctypes_static.ptr -> int)
-> unit =
<fun>
We only use compare_t once (in the qsort denition), so you can choose to inline
it in the OCaml code if you prefer. As the type shows, the resulting qsort value is a
higher-order function, since the fourth argument is itself a function.
Arrays created using Ctypes have a richer runtime structure than C arrays, so we don't
need to pass size information around. Furthermore, we can use OCaml polymorphism
in place of the unsafe void ptr type.
23.5.1
Example: A Command-Line Quicksort
The following is a command-line tool that uses the qsort binding to sort all of the
integers supplied on the standard input:
open Core
open Ctypes
open PosixTypes
open Foreign
let compare_t = ptr void @-> ptr void @-> returning int
let qsort =
foreign
"qsort"
(ptr void
@-> size_t
@-> size_t
@-> funptr compare_t
@-> returning void)
let qsort' cmp arr =
let open Unsigned.Size_t in
let ty = CArray.element_type arr in
let len = of_int (CArray.length arr) in
let elsize = of_int (sizeof ty) in
let start = to_voidp (CArray.start arr) in
let compare l r = cmp !@(from_voidp ty l) !@(from_voidp ty r) in
qsort start len elsize compare
let sort_stdin () =

23.5 Example: A Command-Line Quicksort
421
let array =
In_channel.input_line_exn In_channel.stdin
|> String.split ~on:' '
|> List.map ~f:int_of_string
|> CArray.of_list int
in
qsort' Int.compare array;
CArray.to_list array
|> List.map ~f:Int.to_string
|> String.concat ~sep:" "
|> print_endline
let () =
Command.basic_spec
~summary:"Sort integers on standard input"
Command.Spec.empty
sort_stdin
|> Command.run
Compile it in the usual way with dune and test it against some input data, and also
build the inferred interface so we can examine it more closely:
(executable
(name
qsort)
(libraries core ctypes-foreign))
$ echo 2 4 1 3 | dune exec ./qsort.exe
1 2 3 4
The inferred mli shows us the types of the raw qsort binding and also the qsort'
wrapper function.
$ ocaml-print-intf qsort.ml
val compare_t :
(unit Ctypes_static.ptr -> unit Ctypes_static.ptr -> int) Ctypes.fn
val qsort :
unit Ctypes_static.ptr ->
PosixTypes.size_t ->
PosixTypes.size_t ->
(unit Ctypes_static.ptr -> unit Ctypes_static.ptr -> int) -> unit
val qsort' : ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a Ctypes.CArray.t -> unit
val sort_stdin : unit -> unit
The qsort' wrapper function has a much more canonical OCaml interface than the
raw binding. It accepts a comparator function and a Ctypes array, and returns unit.
Using qsort' to sort arrays is straightforward. Our example code reads the standard
input as a list, converts it to a C array, passes it through qsort, and outputs the result to
the standard output. Again, remember to not confuse the Ctypes.Array module with
the Core.Array module: the former is in scope since we opened Ctypes at the start of
the le.
Lifetime of Allocated Ctypes
Values allocated via Ctypes (i.e., using allocate, Array.make, and so on) will not
be garbage-collected as long as they are reachable from OCaml values. The system

422
Foreign Function Interface
memory they occupy is freed when they do become unreachable, via a nalizer function
registered with the garbage collector (GC).
The denition of reachability for Ctypes values is a little dierent from conventional
OCaml values, though. The allocation functions return an OCaml-managed pointer to
the value, and as long as some derivative pointer is still reachable by the GC, the value
won't be collected.
Derivative means a pointer that's computed from the original pointer via arith-
metic, so a reachable reference to an array element or a structure eld protects the
whole object from collection.
A corollary of the preceding rule is that pointers written into the C heap don't have
any eect on reachability. For example, if you have a C-managed array of pointers to
structs, then you'll need some additional way of keeping the structs themselves around
to protect them from collection. You could achieve this via a global array of values on
the OCaml side that would keep them live until they're no longer needed.
Functions passed to C have similar considerations regarding lifetime. On the OCaml
side, functions created at runtime may be collected when they become unreachable.
As we've seen, OCaml functions passed to C are converted to function pointers, and
function pointers written into the C heap have no eect on the reachability of the
OCaml functions they reference. With qsort things are straightforward, since the
comparison function is only used during the call to qsort itself. However, other C
libraries may store function pointers in global variables or elsewhere, in which case
you'll need to take care that the OCaml functions you pass to them aren't prematurely
garbage-collected.
23.6
Learning More About C Bindings
The Ctypes distribution2 contains a number of larger-scale examples, including:
• Bindings to the POSIX fts API, which demonstrates C callbacks more comprehen-
sively
• A more complete Ncurses binding than the example we opened the chapter with
• A comprehensive test suite that covers the complete library, and can provide useful
snippets for your own bindings
This chapter hasn't really needed you to understand the innards of OCaml at all.
Ctypes does its best to make function bindings easy, but the rest of this part will also
ll you in about interactions with OCaml memory layout in Chapter 24 (Memory Repre-
sentation of Values) and automatic memory management in Chapter 25 (Understanding
the Garbage Collector).
Ctypes gives OCaml programs access to the C representation of values, shielding
you from the details of the OCaml value representation, and introduces an abstraction
layer that hides the details of foreign calls. While this covers a wide variety of situations,
2 http://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes

23.6 Struct Memory Layout
423
it's sometimes necessary to look behind the abstraction to obtain ner control over the
details of the interaction between the two languages.
You can nd more information about the C interface in several places:
• The standard OCaml foreign function interface allows you to glue OCaml and C
together from the other side of the boundary, by writing C functions that operate
on the OCaml representation of values. You can nd details of the standard
interface in the OCaml manual3 and in the book Developing Applications with
Objective Caml4.
• Florent Monnier maintains an excellent online tutorial5 that provides examples of
how to call OCaml functions from C. This covers a wide variety of OCaml data
types and also more complex callbacks between C and OCaml.
23.6.1
Struct Memory Layout
The C language gives implementations a certain amount of freedom in choosing how
to lay out structs in memory. There may be padding between members and at the end of
the struct, in order to satisfy the memory alignment requirements of the host platform.
Ctypes uses platform-appropriate size and alignment information to replicate the struct
layout process. OCaml and C will have consistent views about the layout of the struct
as long as you declare the elds of a struct in the same order and with the same types
as the C library you're binding to.
However, this approach can lead to diculties when the elds of a struct aren't fully
specied in the interface of a library. The interface may list the elds of a structure
without specifying their order, or make certain elds available only on certain platforms,
or insert undocumented elds into struct denitions for performance reasons. For
example, the struct timeval denition used in this chapter accurately describes the
layout of the struct on common platforms, but implementations on some more unusual
architectures include additional padding members that will lead to strange behavior in
the examples.
The Cstubs subpackage of Ctypes addresses this issue. Rather than simply assuming
that struct denitions given by the user accurately reect the actual denitions of structs
used in C libraries, Cstubs generates code that uses the C library headers to discover
the layout of the struct. The good news is that the code that you write doesn't need
to change much. Cstubs provides alternative implementations of the field and seal
functions that you've already used to describe struct timeval; instead of computing
member osets and sizes appropriate for the platform, these implementations obtain
them directly from C.
The details of using Cstubs are available in the online documentation6, along with
instructions on integration with autoconf platform portability instructions.

24
Memory Representation of Values
The FFI interface we described in Chapter 23 (Foreign Function Interface) hides the
precise details of how values are exchanged across C libraries and the OCaml runtime.
There is a simple reason for this: using this interface directly is a delicate operation
that requires understanding a few dierent moving parts before you can get it right.
You rst need to know the mapping between OCaml types and their runtime memory
representation. You also need to ensure that your code is interfacing correctly with
OCaml runtime's memory management.
However, knowledge of the OCaml internals is useful beyond just writing foreign
function interfaces. As you build and maintain more complex OCaml applications,
you'll need to interface with various external system tools that operate on compiled
OCaml binaries. For example, proling tools report output based on the runtime
memory layout, and debuggers execute binaries without any knowledge of the static
OCaml types. To use these tools eectively, you'll need to do some translation between
the OCaml and C worlds.
Luckily, the OCaml toolchain is very predictable. The compiler minimizes the
amount of optimization magic that it performs, and relies instead on its straightforward
execution model for good performance. With some experience, you can know rather
precisely where a block of performance-critical OCaml code is spending its time.
Why Do OCaml Types Disappear at Runtime?
The OCaml compiler runs through several phases during the compilation process. The
rst phase is syntax checking, during which source les are parsed into abstract syntax
trees (ASTs). The next stage is a type checking pass over the AST. In a validly typed
program, a function cannot be applied with an unexpected type. For example, the
print_endline function must receive a single string argument, and an int will result
in a type error.
Since OCaml veries these properties at compile time, it doesn't need to keep track
of as much information at runtime. Thus, later stages of the compiler can discard and
simplify the type declarations to a much more minimal subset that's actually required
to distinguish polymorphic values at runtime. This is a major performance win versus
something like a Java or .NET method call, where the runtime must look up the concrete
instance of the object and dispatch the method call. Those languages amortize some of

24.1 Distinguishing Integers and Pointers at Runtime
425
the cost via Just-in-Time dynamic patching, but OCaml prefers runtime simplicity
instead.
We'll explain this compilation pipeline in more detail in Chapter 26 (The Com-
piler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking) and Chapter 27 (The Compiler Backend:
Bytecode and Native code).
This chapter covers the precise mapping from OCaml types to runtime values and
walks you through them via the toplevel. We'll cover how these values are managed by
the runtime later on in Chapter 25 (Understanding the Garbage Collector).
24.1
OCaml Blocks and Values
A running OCaml program uses blocks of memory (i.e., contiguous sequences of words
in RAM) to represent values such as tuples, records, closures, or arrays. An OCaml
program implicitly allocates a block of memory when such a value is created:
# type t = { foo: int; bar: int };;
type t = { foo : int; bar : int; }
# let x = { foo = 13; bar = 14 };;
val x : t = {foo = 13; bar = 14}
The type declaration t doesn't take up any memory at runtime, but the subsequent
let binding allocates a new block of memory with two words of available space. One
word holds the foo eld, and the other word holds the bar eld. The OCaml compiler
translates such an expression into an explicit allocation for the block from OCaml's
runtime system.
OCaml uses a uniform memory representation in which every OCaml variable is
stored as a value. An OCaml value is a single memory word that is either an immediate
integer or a pointer to some other memory. The OCaml runtime tracks all values so that
it can free them when they are no longer needed. It thus needs to be able to distinguish
between integer and pointer values, since it scans pointers to nd further values but
doesn't follow integers that don't point to anything meaningful beyond their immediate
value.
24.1.1
Distinguishing Integers and Pointers at Runtime
Wrapping primitive types (such as integers) inside another data structure that records
extra metadata about the value is known as boxing. Values are boxed in order to make
it easier for the garbage collector (GC) to do its job, but at the expense of an extra level
of indirection to access the data within the boxed value.
OCaml values don't all have to be boxed at runtime. Instead, values use a single tag
bit per word to distinguish integers and pointers at runtime. The value is an integer
if the lowest bit of the block word is nonzero, and a pointer if the lowest bit of
the block word is zero. Several OCaml types map onto this integer representation,
including bool, int, the empty list, and unit. Some types, like variants, sometimes

426
Memory Representation of Values
use this integer representation and sometimes don't. In particular, for variants, constant
constructors, i.e., constructors with no arguments like None, are represented as integers,
but constructors like Some that carry associated values are boxed.
This representation means that integers are unboxed runtime values in OCaml so
that they can be stored directly without having to allocate a wrapper block. They can
be passed directly to other function calls in registers and are generally the cheapest and
fastest values to use in OCaml.
A value is treated as a memory pointer if its lowest bit is zero. A pointer value can
still be stored unmodied despite this, since pointers are guaranteed to be word-aligned
(with the bottom bits always being zero).
The only problem that remains with this memory representation is distinguishing
between pointers to OCaml values (which should be followed by the GC) and pointers
into the system heap to C values (which shouldn't be followed).
The mechanism for this is simple, since the runtime system keeps track of the heap
blocks it has allocated for OCaml values. If the pointer is inside a heap chunk that is
marked as being managed by the OCaml runtime, it is assumed to point to an OCaml
value. If it points outside the OCaml runtime area, it is treated as an opaque C pointer
to some other system resource.
Some History About OCaml's Word-Aligned Pointers
The alert reader may be wondering how OCaml can guarantee that all of its pointers
are word-aligned. In the old days, when RISC chips such as Sparc, MIPS, and Alpha
were commonplace, unaligned memory accesses were forbidden by the instruction set
architecture and would result in a CPU exception that terminated the program. Thus,
all pointers were historically rounded o to the architecture word size (usually 32 or
64 bits).
Modern CISC processors such as the Intel x86 do support unaligned memory
accesses, but the chip still runs faster if accesses are word-aligned. OCaml therefore
simply mandates that all pointers be word-aligned, which guarantees that the bottom
few bits of any valid pointer will be zero. Setting the bottom bit to a nonzero value is
a simple way to mark an integer, at the cost of losing that single bit of precision.
An even more alert reader will be wondering about the performance implications
are for integer arithmetic using this tagged representation. Since the bottom bit is set,
any operation on the integer has to shift the bottom bit right to recover the native
value. The native code OCaml compiler generates ecient x86 assembly code in this
case, taking advantage of modern processor instructions to hide the extra shifts where
possible. Addition is a single LEA x86 instruction, subtraction can be two instructions,
and multiplication is only a few more.

24.2 Blocks and Values
427
24.2
Blocks and Values
An OCaml block is the basic unit of allocation on the heap. A block consists of a
one-word header (either 32 or 64 bits depending on the CPU architecture) followed by
variable-length data that is either opaque bytes or an array of elds. The header has a
multipurpose tag byte that denes whether to interpret the subsequent data as opaque
bytes or OCaml elds.
The GC never inspects opaque bytes. If the tag indicates an array of OCaml elds
are present, their contents are all treated as more valid OCaml values. The GC always
inspects elds and follows them as part of the collection process described earlier.
The size eld records the length of the block in memory words. This is 22 bits
on 32-bit platforms, which is the reason OCaml strings are limited to 16 MB on
that architecture. If you need bigger strings, either switch to a 64-bit host, or use the
Bigarray module.
The 2-bit color eld is used by the GC to keep track of its state during mark-
and-sweep collection. We'll come back to this eld in Chapter 25 (Understanding the
Garbage Collector). This tag isn't exposed to OCaml source code in any case.
A block's tag byte is multipurpose, and indicates whether the data array represents
opaque bytes or elds. If a block's tag is greater than or equal to No_scan_tag (251),
then the block's data are all opaque bytes, and are not scanned by the collector. The
most common such block is the string type, which we describe in more detail later in
this chapter.
The exact representation of values inside a block depends on their static OCaml
type. All OCaml types are distilled down into values, and summarized below.
• int or char are stored directly as a value, shifted left by 1 bit, with the least signicant
bit set to 1.
• unit, [], false are all stored as OCaml int 0.
• true is stored as OCaml int 1.
• Foo | Bar variants are stored as ascending OCaml ints, starting from 0.
• Foo | Bar of int variants with parameters are boxed, while variants with no pa-
rameters are unboxed.
• Polymorphic variants with parameters are boxed with an extra header word to store
the value, as compared to normal variants. Polymorphic variants with no param-
eters are unboxed.
• Floating-point numbers are stored as a block with a single eld containing the
double-precision oat.
• Strings are word-aligned byte arrays with an explicit length.

428
Memory Representation of Values
• [1; 2; 3] lists are stored as 1::2::3::[] where [] is an int, and h::t a block with
tag 0 and two parameters.
• Tuples, records, and arrays are stored as a C array of values. Arrays can be variable
size, but tuples and records are xed-size.
• Records or arrays that are all oat use a special tag for unboxed arrays of oats, or
records that only have float elds.
24.2.1
Integers, Characters, and Other Basic Types
Many basic types are eciently stored as unboxed integers at runtime. The native int
type is the most obvious, although it drops a single bit of precision due to the tag bit.
Other atomic types such as unit and the empty list [] value are stored as constant
integers. Boolean values have a value of 1 and 0 for true and false, respectively.
These basic types such as empty lists and unit are very ecient to use, since
integers are never allocated on the heap. They can be passed directly in registers and
not appear on the stack if you don't have too many parameters to your functions.
Modern architectures such as x86_64 have a lot of spare registers to further improve
the eciency of using unboxed integers.
24.3
Tuples, Records, and Arrays
Tuples, records, and arrays are all represented identically at runtime as a block with
tag 0. Tuples and records have constant sizes determined at compile time, whereas
arrays can be of variable length. While arrays are restricted to containing a single type
of element in the OCaml type system, this is not required by the memory representation.
You can check the dierence between a block and a direct integer yourself using the
Obj module, which exposes the internal representation of values to OCaml code:
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr (1,2,3));;
- : bool = true
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr 1);;
- : bool = false
The Obj.repr function retrieves the runtime representation of any OCaml value.
Obj.is_block checks the bottom bit to determine if the value is a block header or an
unboxed integer.

24.4 Variants and Lists
429
24.3.1
Floating-Point Numbers and Arrays
Floating-point numbers in OCaml are always stored as full, double-precision values.
Individual oating-point values are stored as a block with a single eld that contains
the number. This block has the Double_tag set, which signals to the collector that the
oating-point value is not to be scanned:
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr 1.0);;
- : int = 253
# Obj.double_tag;;
- : int = 253
Since each oating-point value is boxed in a separate memory block, it can be
inecient to handle large arrays of oats in comparison to unboxed integers. OCaml
therefore special-cases records or arrays that contain only float types. These are
stored in a block that contains the oats packed directly in the data section, with
Double_array_tag set to signal to the collector that the contents are not OCaml values.
First, let's check that oat arrays do in fact have a dierent tag number from normal
oating-point values:
# Obj.double_tag;;
- : int = 253
# Obj.double_array_tag;;
- : int = 254
This tells us that oat arrays have a tag value of 254. Now let's test some sample
values using the Obj.tag function to check that the allocated block has the expected
runtime tag, and also use Obj.double_field to retrieve a oat from within the block:
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr [| 1.0; 2.0; 3.0 |]);;
- : int = 254
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) );;
- : int = 0
# Obj.double_field (Obj.repr [| 1.1; 2.2; 3.3 |]) 1;;
- : float = 2.2
# Obj.double_field (Obj.repr 1.234) 0;;
- : float = 1.234
The rst thing we tested was that a oat array has the correct unboxed oat array
tag value (254). However, the next line tests a tuple of oating-point values instead,
which are not optimized in the same way and have the normal tuple tag value (0).
Only records and arrays can have the oat array optimization, and for records, every
single eld must be a oat.

Memory Representation of Values
24.4
Variants and Lists
Basic variant types with no extra parameters for any of their branches are simply stored
as an OCaml integer, starting with 0 for the rst option and in ascending order:
# type t = Apple | Orange | Pear;;
type t = Apple | Orange | Pear
# ((Obj.magic (Obj.repr Apple)) : int);;
- : int = 0
# ((Obj.magic (Obj.repr Pear)) : int);;
- : int = 2
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr Apple);;
- : bool = false
Obj.magic unsafely forces a type cast between any two OCaml types; in this example,
the int type hint retrieves the runtime integer value. The Obj.is_block conrms that
the value isn't a more complex block, but just an OCaml int.
Variants that have parameters are a little more complex. They are stored as blocks,
with the value tags ascending from 0 (counting from leftmost variants with parameters).
The parameters are stored as words in the block:
# type t = Apple | Orange of int | Pear of string | Kiwi;;
type t = Apple | Orange of int | Pear of string | Kiwi
# Obj.is_block (Obj.repr (Orange 1234));;
- : bool = true
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr (Orange 1234));;
- : int = 0
# Obj.tag (Obj.repr (Pear "xyz"));;
- : int = 1
# (Obj.magic (Obj.field (Obj.repr (Orange 1234)) 0) : int);;
- : int = 1234
# (Obj.magic (Obj.field (Obj.repr (Pear "xyz")) 0) : string);;
- : string = "xyz"
In the preceding example, the Apple and Kiwi values are still stored as normal
OCaml integers with values 0 and 1, respectively. The Orange and Pear values both
have parameters and are stored as blocks whose tags ascend from 0 (and so Pear has a
tag of 1, as the use of Obj.tag veries). Finally, the parameters are elds that contain
OCaml values within the block, and Obj.field can be used to retrieve them.
Lists are stored with a representation that is exactly the same as if the list was written
as a variant type with Nil and Cons. The empty list [] is an integer 0, and subsequent
blocks have tag 0 and two parameters: a block with the current value, and a pointer to
the rest of the list.
Obj Module Considered Harmful
Obj is an undocumented module that exposes the internals of the OCaml compiler and
runtime. It is very useful for examining and understanding how your code will behave
at runtime but should never be used for production code unless you understand the im-
plications. The module bypasses the OCaml type system, making memory corruption
and segmentation faults possible.

24.5 Polymorphic Variants
431
Some theorem provers such as Coq do output code that uses Obj internally, but the
external module signatures never expose it. Unless you too have a machine proof of
correctness to accompany your use of Obj, stay away from it except for debugging!
Due to this encoding, there is a limit around 240 variants with parameters that applies
to each type denition, but the only limit on the number of variants without parameters
is the size of the native integer (either 31 or 63 bits). This limit arises because of the
size of the tag byte, and that some of the high-numbered tags are reserved.
24.5
Polymorphic Variants
Polymorphic variants are more exible than normal variants when writing code but are
slightly less ecient at runtime. This is because there isn't as much static compile-time
information available to optimize their memory layout.
A polymorphic variant without any parameters is stored as an unboxed integer and
so only takes up one word of memory, just like a normal variant. This integer value is
determined by applying a hash function to the name of the variant. The hash function
is exposed via the compiler-libs package that reveals some of the internals of the
OCaml compiler:
# #require "ocaml-compiler-libs.common";;
# Btype.hash_variant "Foo";;
- : int = 3505894
# (Obj.magic (Obj.repr `Foo) : int);;
- : int = 3505894
The hash function is designed to give the same results on 32-bit and 64-bit ar-
chitectures, so the memory representation is stable across dierent CPUs and host
types.
Polymorphic variants use more memory space than normal variants when param-
eters are included in the data type constructors. Normal variants use the tag byte to
encode the variant value and save the elds for the contents, but this single byte is
insucient to encode the hashed value for polymorphic variants. They must allocate a
new block (with tag 0) and store the value in there instead. Polymorphic variants with
constructors thus use one word of memory more than normal variant constructors.
Another ineciency over normal variants is when a polymorphic variant constructor
has more than one parameter. Normal variants hold parameters as a single at block
with multiple elds for each entry, but polymorphic variants must adopt a more exible
uniform memory representation, since they may be reused in a dierent context across
compilation units. They allocate a tuple block for the parameters that is pointed to
from the argument eld of the variant. There are thus three additional words for such
variants, along with an extra memory indirection due to the tuple.
The extra space usage is generally not signicant in a typical application, and
polymorphic variants oer a great deal more exibility than normal variants. However,
if you're writing code that demands high performance or must run within tight memory

432
Memory Representation of Values
bounds, the runtime layout is at least very predictable. The OCaml compiler never
switches memory representation due to optimization passes. This lets you predict the
precise runtime layout by referring to these guidelines and your source code.
24.6
String Values
OCaml strings (and their mutable cousins, bytes) are standard OCaml blocks with
the header size dening the size of the string in machine words. The String_tag (252)
is higher than the No_scan_tag, indicating that the contents of the block are opaque to
the collector. The block contents are the contents of the string, with padding bytes to
align the block on a word boundary.
On a 32-bit machine, the padding is calculated based on the modulo of the string
length and word size to ensure the result is word-aligned. A 64-bit machine extends
the potential padding up to 7 bytes instead of 3. Given a string length modulo 4:
• 0 has padding 00 00 00 03
• 1 has padding 00 00 02
• 2 has padding 00 01
• 3 has padding 00
This string representation is a clever way to ensure that the contents are always
zero-terminated by the padding word and to still compute its length eciently without
scanning the whole string. The following formula is used:
number_of_words_in_block * sizeof(word) - last_byte_of_block - 1
The guaranteed NULL termination comes in handy when passing a string to C, but
is not relied upon to compute the length from OCaml code. OCaml strings can thus
contain NULL bytes at any point within the string.
Care should be taken that any C library functions that receive these buers can also
cope with arbitrary bytes within the buer contents and are not expecting C strings. For
instance, the C memcopy or memmove standard library functions can operate on arbitrary
data, but strlen or strcpy both require a NULL-terminated buer, and neither has a
mechanism for encoding a NULL value within its contents.
24.7
Custom Heap Blocks
OCaml supports custom heap blocks via a Custom_tag that lets the runtime perform
user-dened operations over OCaml values. A custom block lives in the OCaml heap

24.7 Managing External Memory with Bigarray
433
like an ordinary block and can be of whatever size the user desires. The Custom_tag
(255) is higher than No_scan_tag and so isn't scanned by the GC.
The rst word of the data within the custom block is a C pointer to a struct of
custom operations. The custom block cannot have pointers to OCaml blocks and is
opaque to the GC:
struct custom_operations {
char *identifier;
void (*finalize)(value v);
int (*compare)(value v1, value v2);
intnat (*hash)(value v);
void (*serialize)(value v,
/*out*/ uintnat * wsize_32 /*size in bytes*/,
/*out*/ uintnat * wsize_64 /*size in bytes*/);
uintnat (*deserialize)(void * dst);
int (*compare_ext)(value v1, value v2);
};
The custom operations specify how the runtime should perform polymorphic com-
parison, hashing and binary marshaling. They also optionally contain a nalizer that
the runtime calls just before the block is garbage-collected. This nalizer has nothing
to do with ordinary OCaml nalizers (as created by Gc.finalize and explained in
Chapter 25 (Understanding the Garbage Collector)). They are instead used to call C
cleanup functions such as free.
24.7.1
Managing External Memory with Bigarray
A common use of custom blocks is to manage external system memory directly from
within OCaml. The Bigarray interface was originally intended to exchange data with
Fortran code, and maps a block of system memory as a multidimensional array that can
be accessed from OCaml. Bigarray operations work directly on the external memory
without requiring it to be copied into the OCaml heap (which is a potentially expensive
operation for large arrays).
Bigarray sees a lot of use beyond just scientic computing, and several Core libraries
use it for general-purpose I/O:
Iobuf The Iobuf module maps I/O buers as a one-dimensional array of bytes. It
provides a sliding window interface that lets consumer processes read from
the buer while it's being lled by producers. This lets OCaml use I/O buers
that have been externally allocated by the operating system without any extra
data copying.
Bigstring The Bigstring module provides a String-like interface that uses
Bigarray internally. The Bigbuffer collects these into extensible string
buers that can operate entirely on external system memory.
The Lacaml1 library isn't part of Core but provides the recommended interfaces
to the widely used BLAS and LAPACK mathematical Fortran libraries. These allow

developers to write high-performance numerical code for applications that require
linear algebra. It supports large vectors and matrices, but with static typing safety of
OCaml to make it easier to write safe algorithms.

25
Understanding the Garbage
Collector
This chapter includes contributions from Stephen Weeks and Sadiq Jaer.
We've described the runtime format of individual OCaml variables earlier, in Chap-
ter 24 (Memory Representation of Values). When you execute your program, OCaml
manages the lifecycle of these variables by regularly scanning allocated values and
freeing them when they're no longer needed. This in turn means that your applications
don't need to manually implement memory management, and it greatly reduces the
likelihood of memory leaks creeping into your code.
The OCaml runtime is a C library that provides routines that can be called from
running OCaml programs. The runtime manages a heap, which is a collection of
memory regions that it obtains from the operating system. The runtime uses this
memory to hold heap blocks that it lls up with OCaml values in response to allocation
requests by the OCaml program.
25.1
Mark and Sweep Garbage Collection
When there isn't enough memory available to satisfy an allocation request from the
pool of allocated heap blocks, the runtime system invokes the garbage collector (GC).
An OCaml program can't explicitly free a value when it is done with it. Instead, the GC
regularly determines which values are live and which values are dead, i.e., no longer
in use. Dead values are collected and their memory made available for reuse by the
application.
The GC doesn't keep constant track of values as they are allocated and used. Instead,
it regularly scans them by starting from a set of root values that the application always
has access to (such as the stack). The GC maintains a directed graph in which heap
blocks are nodes, and there is an edge from heap block b1 to heap block b2 if some
eld of b1 is a pointer to b2.
All blocks reachable from the roots by following edges in the graph must be retained,
and unreachable blocks can be reused by the application. The algorithm used by
OCaml to perform this heap traversal is commonly known as mark and sweep garbage
collection, and we'll explain it further now.

436
Understanding the Garbage Collector
25.2
Generational Garbage Collection
The usual OCaml programming style involves allocating many small values that are
used for a short period of time and then never accessed again. OCaml takes advantage
of this fact to improve performance by using a generational GC.
A generational GC maintains separate memory regions to hold blocks based on how
long the blocks have been live. OCaml's heap is split into two such regions:
• A small, xed-size minor heap where most blocks are initially allocated
• A larger, variable-size major heap for blocks that have been live longer
A typical functional programming style means that young blocks tend to die young
and old blocks tend to stay around for longer than young ones. This is often referred to
as the generational hypothesis.
OCaml uses dierent memory layouts and garbage-collection algorithms for the
major and minor heaps to account for this generational dierence. We'll explain how
they dier in more detail next.
The Gc Module and OCAMLRUNPARAM
OCaml provides several mechanisms to query and alter the behavior of the runtime
system. The Gc module provides this functionality from within OCaml code, and we'll
frequently refer to it in the rest of the chapter. As with several other standard library
modules, Core alters the Gc interface from the standard OCaml library. We'll assume
that you've opened Core in our explanations.
You can also control the behavior of OCaml programs by setting the OCAMLRUNPARAM
environment variable before launching your application. This lets you set GC param-
eters without recompiling, for example to benchmark the eects of dierent settings.
The format of OCAMLRUNPARAM is documented in the OCaml manuala.
a https://ocaml.org/manual/runtime.html
25.3
The Fast Minor Heap
The minor heap is where most of your short-lived values are held. It consists of one
contiguous chunk of virtual memory containing a sequence of OCaml blocks. If there
is space, allocating a new block is a fast, constant-time operation that requires just a
couple of CPU instructions.
To garbage-collect the minor heap, OCaml uses copying collection to move all
live blocks in the minor heap to the major heap. This takes work proportional to the
number of live blocks in the minor heap, which is typically small according to the
generational hypothesis. In general, the garbage collector stops the world (that is, halts
the application) while it runs, which is why it's so important that it complete quickly
to let the application resume running with minimal interruption.

25.3 Understanding Allocation
437
25.3.1
Allocating on the Minor Heap
The minor heap is a contiguous chunk of virtual memory that is usually a few megabytes
in size so that it can be scanned quickly.
The runtime stores the boundaries of the minor heap in two pointers that delimit the
start and end of the heap region (caml_young_start and caml_young_end, but we will
drop the caml_young prex for brevity). The base is the memory address returned by
the system malloc, and start is aligned against the next nearest word boundary from
base to make it easier to store OCaml values.
In a fresh minor heap, the limit equals the start, and the current ptr will equal
the end. ptr decreases as blocks are allocated until it reaches limit, at which point a
minor garbage collection is triggered.
Allocating a block in the minor heap just requires ptr to be decremented by the
size of the block (including the header) and a check that it's not less than limit. If
there isn't enough space left for the block without decrementing past limit, a minor
garbage collection is triggered. This is a very fast check (with no branching) on most
CPU architectures.
Understanding Allocation
You may wonder why limit is required at all, since it always seems to equal start.
It's because the easiest way for the runtime to schedule a minor heap collection is
by setting limit to equal end. The next allocation will never have enough space after
this is done and will always trigger a garbage collection. There are various internal
reasons for such early collections, such as handling pending UNIX signals, but they
don't ordinarily matter for application code.
It is possible to write loops or recurse in a way that may take a long time to do an
allocation - if at all. To ensure that UNIX signals and other internal bookkeeping that
require interrupting the running OCaml program still happen the compiler introduces
poll points into generated native code.
These poll points check ptr against limit and developers should expect them to be
placed at the start of every function and the back edge of loops. The compiler includes
a dataow pass that removes all but the minimum set of points necessary to ensure
these checks happen in a bounded amount of time.
Setting the Size of the Minor Heap
The default minor heap size in OCaml is normally 2 MB on 64-bit platforms, but this
is increased to 8 MB if you use Core (which generally prefers default settings that
improve performance, but at the cost of a bigger memory prole). This setting can be

438
Understanding the Garbage Collector
overridden via the s=<words> argument to OCAMLRUNPARAM. You can change it after the
program has started by calling the Gc.set function:
# open Core;;
# let c = Gc.get ();;
val c : Gc.Control.t =
{Core.Gc.Control.minor_heap_size = 262144; major_heap_increment =
15;
space_overhead = 120; verbose = 0; max_overhead = 500;
stack_limit = 1048576; allocation_policy = 2; window_size = 1;
custom_major_ratio = 44; custom_minor_ratio = 100;
custom_minor_max_size = 8192}
# Gc.tune ~minor_heap_size:(262144 * 2) ();;
- : unit = ()
Changing the GC size dynamically will trigger an immediate minor heap collec-
tion. Note that Core increases the default minor heap size from the standard OCaml
installation quite signicantly, and you'll want to reduce this if running in very memory-
constrained environments.
25.4
The Long-Lived Major Heap
The major heap is where the bulk of the longer-lived and larger values in your program
are stored. It consists of any number of noncontiguous chunks of virtual memory, each
containing live blocks interspersed with regions of free memory. The runtime system
maintains a free-list data structure that indexes all the free memory that it has allocated,
and uses it to satisfy allocation requests for OCaml blocks.
The major heap is typically much larger than the minor heap and can scale to
gigabytes in size. It is cleaned via a mark-and-sweep garbage collection algorithm that
operates in several phases:
• The mark phase scans the block graph and marks all live blocks by setting a bit in
the tag of the block header (known as the color tag).
• The sweep phase sequentially scans the heap chunks and identies dead blocks that
weren't marked earlier.
• The compact phase relocates live blocks into a freshly allocated heap to eliminate
gaps in the free list. This prevents the fragmentation of heap blocks in long-
running programs and normally occurs much less frequently than the mark and
sweep phases.
A major garbage collection must also stop the world to ensure that blocks can be
moved around without this being observed by the live application. The mark-and-sweep
phases run incrementally over slices of the heap to avoid pausing the application for
long periods of time, and also precede each slice with a fast minor collection. Only the
compaction phase touches all the memory in one go, and is a relatively rare operation.

25.4 Memory Allocation Strategies
439
25.4.1
Allocating on the Major Heap
The major heap consists of a singly linked list of contiguous memory chunks sorted in
increasing order of virtual address. Each chunk is a single memory region allocated via
malloc(3) and consists of a header and data area which contains OCaml heap chunks.
A heap chunk header contains:
• The malloced virtual address of the memory region containing the chunk
• The size in bytes of the data area
• An allocation size in bytes used during heap compaction to merge small blocks to
defragment the heap
• A link to the next heap chunk in the list
• A pointer to the start and end of the range of blocks that may contain unexamined
elds and need to be scanned later. Only used after mark stack overow.
Each chunk's data area starts on a page boundary, and its size is a multiple of the
page size (4 KB). It contains a contiguous sequence of heap blocks that can be as small
as one or two 4 KB pages, but are usually allocated in 1 MB chunks (or 512 KB on
32-bit architectures).
Controlling the Major Heap Increment
The Gc module uses the major_heap_increment value to control the major heap growth.
This denes the number of words to add to the major heap per expansion and is the
only memory allocation operation that the operating system observes from the OCaml
runtime after initial startup (since the minor is xed in size).
Allocating an OCaml value on the major heap rst checks the free list of blocks for
a suitable region to place it. If there isn't enough room on the free list, the runtime
expands the major heap by allocating a fresh heap chunk that will be large enough.
That chunk is then added to the free list, and the free list is checked again (and this
time will denitely succeed).
Older versions of OCaml required setting a xed number of bytes for the major heap
increment. That was a value that was tricky to get right: too small of a value could lead
to lots of smaller heap chunks spread across dierent regions of virtual memory that
require more housekeeping in the OCaml runtime to keep track of them; too large of a
value can waste memory for programs with small heaps.
You can use Gc.tune to set that value, but the values are a little counter-intuitive, for
backwards-compatibility reasons. Values under 1000 are interpreted as percentages,
and the default is 15%. Values 1000 and over are treated as a raw number of bytes. But
most of the time, you won't set the value at all.
25.4.2
Memory Allocation Strategies
The major heap does its best to manage memory allocation as eciently as possible and
relies on heap compaction to ensure that memory stays contiguous and unfragmented.

440
Understanding the Garbage Collector
The default allocation policy normally works ne for most applications, but it's worth
bearing in mind that there are other options, too.
The free list of blocks is always checked rst when allocating a new block in the
major heap. The default free list search is called best-t allocation, with alternatives
next-t and rst-t algorithms also available.
Best-Fit Allocation
The best-t allocator is a combination of two strategies. The rst, size-segregated free
lists, is based on the observation that nearly all major heap allocations in OCaml are
small (consider list elements and tuples which are only a couple of machine words).
Best t keeps separate free lists for sizes up to and including 16 words which gives a
fast path for most allocations. Allocations for these sizes can be serviced from their
segregated free lists or, if they are empty, from the next size with a space.
The second strategy, for larger allocations, is the use of a specialized data structure
known as a splay tree for the free list. This is a type of search tree that adapts to recent
access patterns. For our use this means that the most commonly requested allocation
sizes are the quickest to access.
Small allocations, when there are no larger sizes available in the segregated free
lists, and large allocations greater than sixteen words are serviced from the main free
list. The free list is queried for the smallest block that is at least as large as the allocation
requested.
Best-t allocation is the default allocation mechanism. It represents a good trade-o
between the allocation cost (in terms of CPU work) and heap fragmentation.
Next-Fit Allocation
Next-t allocation keeps a pointer to the block in the free list that was most recently
used to satisfy a request. When a new request comes in, the allocator searches from
the next block to the end of the free list, and then from the beginning of the free list up
to that block.
Next-t allocation is quite a cheap allocation mechanism, since the same heap chunk
can be reused across allocation requests until it runs out. This in turn means that there
is good memory locality to use CPU caches better. The big downside of next-t is that
since most allocations are small, large blocks at the start of the free list become heavily
fragmented.
First-Fit Allocation
If your program allocates values of many varied sizes, you may sometimes nd that
your free list becomes fragmented. In this situation, the GC is forced to perform an
expensive compaction despite there being free chunks, since none of the chunks alone
are big enough to satisfy the request.
First-t allocation focuses on reducing memory fragmentation (and hence the num-
ber of compactions), but at the expense of slower memory allocation. Every allocation
scans the free list from the beginning for a suitable free chunk, instead of reusing the
most recent heap chunk as the next-t allocator does.

25.4 Marking and Scanning the Heap
441
For some workloads that need more real-time behavior under load, the reduction in
the frequency of heap compaction will outweigh the extra allocation cost.
Controlling the Heap Allocation Policy
You can set the heap allocation policy by calling Gc.tune:
# Gc.tune ~allocation_policy:First_fit ();;
- : unit = ()
The same behavior can be controlled via an environment variable by setting
OCAMLRUNPARAM to a=0 for next-t, a=1 for rst-t, or a=2 for best-t.
25.4.3
Marking and Scanning the Heap
The marking process can take a long time to run over the complete major heap and
has to pause the main application while it's active. It therefore runs incrementally by
marking the heap in slices. Each value in the heap has a 2-bit color eld in its header
that is used to store information about whether the value has been marked so that the
GC can resume easily between slices.
• Blue: On the free list and not currently in use
• White (during marking): Not reached yet, but possibly reachable
• White (during sweeping): Unreachable and can be freed
• Black: Reachable, and its elds have been scanned
The color tags in the value headers store most of the state of the marking process,
allowing it to be paused and resumed later. On allocation, all heap values are initially
given the color white indicating they are possibly reachable but haven't been scanned
yet. The GC and application alternate between marking a slice of the major heap and
actually getting on with executing the program logic. The OCaml runtime calculates a
sensible value for the size of each major heap slice based on the rate of allocation and
available memory.
The marking process starts with a set of root values that are always live (such as the
application stack and globals). These root values have their color set to black and are
pushed on to a specialized data structure known as the mark stack. Marking proceeds
by popping a value from the stack and examining its elds. Any elds containing
white-colored blocks are changed to black and pushed onto the mark stack.
This process is repeated until the mark stack is empty and there are no further values
to mark. There's one important edge case in this process, though. The mark stack can
only grow to a certain size, after which the GC can no longer recurse into intermediate
values since it has nowhere to store them while it follows their elds. This is known
as mark stack overow and a process called pruning begins. Pruning empties the mark
stack entirely, summarizing the addresses of each block as start and end ranges in each
heap chunk header.
Later in the marking process when the mark stack is empty it is replenished by
redarkening the heap. This starts at the rst heap chunk (by address) that has blocks

442
Understanding the Garbage Collector
needing redarkening (i.e were removed from the mark stack during a prune) and entries
from the redarkening range are added to the mark stack until it is a quarter full. The
emptying and replenishing cycle continues until there are no heap chunks with ranges
left to redarken.
Controlling Major Heap Collections
You can trigger a single slice of the major GC via the major_slice call. This performs
a minor collection rst, and then a single slice. The size of the slice is normally
automatically computed by the GC to an appropriate value and returns this value so
that you can modify it in future calls if necessary:
# Gc.major_slice 0;;
- : int = 0
# Gc.full_major ();;
- : unit = ()
The space_overhead setting controls how aggressive the GC is about setting the
slice size to a large size. This represents the proportion of memory used for live data
that will be wasted because the GC doesn't immediately collect unreachable blocks.
Core defaults this to 100 to reect a typical system that isn't overly memory-constrained.
Set this even higher if you have lots of memory, or lower to cause the GC to work
harder and collect blocks faster at the expense of using more CPU time.
25.4.4
Heap Compaction
After a certain number of major GC cycles have completed, the heap may begin to be
fragmented due to values being deallocated out of order from how they were allocated.
This makes it harder for the GC to nd a contiguous block of memory for fresh
allocations, which in turn would require the heap to be grown unnecessarily.
The heap compaction cycle avoids this by relocating all the values in the major
heap into a fresh heap that places them all contiguously in memory again. A naive
implementation of the algorithm would require extra memory to store the new heap,
but OCaml performs the compaction in place within the existing heap.
Controlling Frequency of Compactions
The max_overhead setting in the Gc module denes the connection between free mem-
ory and allocated memory after which compaction is activated.
A value of 0 triggers a compaction after every major garbage collection cycle,
whereas the maximum value of 1000000 disables heap compaction completely. The
default settings should be ne unless you have unusual allocation patterns that are
causing a higher-than-usual rate of compactions:
# Gc.tune ~max_overhead:0 ();;
- : unit = ()

25.4 The Mutable Write Barrier
443
25.4.5
Intergenerational Pointers
One complexity of generational collection arises from the fact that minor heap sweeps
are much more frequent than major heap collections. In order to know which blocks in
the minor heap are live, the collector must track which minor-heap blocks are directly
pointed to by major-heap blocks. Without this information, each minor collection would
also require scanning the much larger major heap.
OCaml maintains a set of such intergenerational pointers to avoid this dependency
between a major and minor heap collection. The compiler introduces a write barrier
to update this so-called remembered set whenever a major-heap block is modied to
point at a minor-heap block.
The Mutable Write Barrier
The write barrier can have profound implications for the structure of your code. It's
one of the reasons using immutable data structures and allocating a fresh copy with
changes can sometimes be faster than mutating a record in place.
The OCaml compiler keeps track of any mutable types and adds a call to the
runtime caml_modify function before making the change. This checks the location of
the target write and the value it's being changed to, and ensures that the remembered
set is consistent. Although the write barrier is reasonably ecient, it can sometimes
be slower than simply allocating a fresh value on the fast minor heap and doing some
extra minor collections.
Let's see this for ourselves with a simple test program. You'll need to install the Core
benchmarking suite via opam install core_bench before you compile this code:
open Core
open Core_bench
module Mutable = struct
type t =
{ mutable iters : int
; mutable count : float
}
let rec test t =
if t.iters = 0
then ()
else (
t.iters <- t.iters - 1;
t.count <- t.count +. 1.0;
test t)
end
module Immutable = struct
type t =
{ iters : int
; count : float
}
let rec test t =
if t.iters = 0

444
Understanding the Garbage Collector
then ()
else test { iters = t.iters - 1; count = t.count +. 1.0 }
end
let () =
let iters = 1_000_000 in
let count = 0.0 in
let tests =
[ Bench.Test.create ~name:"mutable" (fun () ->
Mutable.test { iters; count })
; Bench.Test.create ~name:"immutable" (fun () ->
Immutable.test { iters; count })
]
in
Bench.make_command tests |> Command.run
This program denes a type t1 that is mutable and t2 that is immutable. The
benchmark loop iterates over both elds and increments a counter. Compile and execute
this with some extra options to show the amount of garbage collection occurring:
$ dune exec -- ./barrier_bench.exe -ascii alloc -quota 1
Estimated testing time 2s (2 benchmarks x 1s). Change using '-quota'.

There is a space/time trade-o here. The mutable version takes longer to complete
than the immutable one but allocates many fewer minor-heap words than the immutable
version. Minor allocation in OCaml is very fast, and so it is often better to use immutable
data structures in preference to the more conventional mutable versions. On the other
hand, if you only rarely mutate a value, it can be faster to take the write-barrier hit and
not allocate at all.
The only way to know for sure is to benchmark your program under real-world
scenarios using Core_bench and experiment with the trade-os. The command-line
benchmark binaries have a number of useful options that aect garbage collection

25.5 Attaching Finalizer Functions to Values
445
25.5
Attaching Finalizer Functions to Values
OCaml's automatic memory management guarantees that a value will eventually be
freed when it's no longer in use, either via the GC sweeping it or the program termi-
nating. It's sometimes useful to run extra code just before a value is freed by the GC,
for example, to check that a le descriptor has been closed, or that a log message is
recorded.
What Values Can Be Finalized?
Various values cannot have nalizers attached since they aren't heap-allocated. Some
examples of values that are not heap-allocated are integers, constant constructors,
Booleans, the empty array, the empty list, and the unit value. The exact list of what is
heap-allocated or not is implementation-dependent, which is why Core provides the
Heap_block module to explicitly check before attaching the nalizer.
Some constant values can be heap-allocated but never deallocated during the lifetime
of the program, for example, a list of integer constants. Heap_block explicitly checks
to see if the value is in the major or minor heap, and rejects most constant values.
Compiler optimizations may also duplicate some immutable values such as oating-
point values in arrays. These may be nalized while another duplicate copy is being
used by the program.
Core provides a Heap_block module that dynamically checks if a given value
is suitable for nalizing. Core keeps the functions for registering nalizers in the
Core.Gc.Expert module. Finalizers can run at any time in any thread, so they can be
pretty hard to reason about in multi-threaded contexts. Async, which we discussed in
Chapter 17 (Concurrent Programming with Async), shadows the Gc module with its
own module that contains a function, Gc.add_finalizer, which is concurrency-safe. In
particular, nalizers are scheduled in their own Async job, and care is taken by Async
to capture exceptions and raise them to the appropriate monitor for error-handling.
Let's explore this with a small example that nalizes values of dierent types, all of
which are heap-allocated.
open Core
open Async
let attach_finalizer n v =
match Heap_block.create v with
| None -> printf "%20s: FAIL\n%!" n
| Some hb ->
let final _ = printf "%20s: OK\n%!" n in
Gc.add_finalizer hb final
type t = { foo : bool }
let main () =
attach_finalizer "allocated variant" (`Foo (Random.bool ()));
attach_finalizer "allocated string" (Bytes.create 4);
attach_finalizer "allocated record" { foo = (Random.bool ()) };

446
Understanding the Garbage Collector
Gc.compact ();
return ()
let () =
Command.async
~summary:"Testing finalizers"
(Command.Param.return main)
|> Command.run
Building and running this should show the following output:
$ dune exec -- ./finalizer.exe
allocated record: OK
allocated string: OK
allocated variant: OK
The GC calls the nalization functions in the order of the deallocation. If several
values become unreachable during the same GC cycle, the nalization functions will
be called in the reverse order of the corresponding calls to add_finalizer. Each call
to add_finalizer adds to the set of functions, which are run when the value becomes
unreachable. You can have many nalizers all pointing to the same heap block if you
wish.
After a garbage collection determines that a heap block b is unreachable, it removes
from the set of nalizers all the functions associated with b, and serially applies each
of those functions to b. Thus, every nalizer function attached to b will run at most
once. However, program termination will not cause all the nalizers to be run before
the runtime exits.
The nalizer can use all features of OCaml, including assignments that make the
value reachable again and thus prevent it from being garbage-collected. It can also loop
forever, which will cause other nalizers to be interleaved with it.

The Compiler Frontend: Parsing
and Type Checking
Compiling source code into executable programs involves a fairly complex set of
libraries, linkers, and assemblers. While Dune mostly hides this complexity from you,
it's still useful to understand how these pieces work so that you can debug performance
problems, or come up with solutions for unusual situations that aren't well handled by
existing tools.
OCaml has a strong emphasis on static type safety and rejects source code that
doesn't meet its requirements as early as possible. The compiler does this by running the
source code through a series of checks and transformations. Each stage performs its job
(e.g., type checking, optimization, or code generation) and discards some information
from the previous stage. The nal native code output is low-level assembly code that
doesn't know anything about the OCaml modules or objects that the compiler started
with.
In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:
• An overview of the compiler codebase and the compilation pipeline, and what each
stage represents
• Parsing, which goes from raw text to the abstract syntax tree
• PPX's, which further transform the AST
• Type-checking, including module resolution
The details of the remainder of the compilation process, which gets all the way to
executable code comes next, in Chapter 27 (The Compiler Backend: Bytecode and
Native code).
26.1
An Overview of the Toolchain
The OCaml tools accept textual source code as input, using the lename extensions
.ml and .mli for modules and signatures, respectively. We explained the basics of the
build process in Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and Programs), so we'll assume you've
built a few OCaml programs already by this point.
Each source le represents a compilation unit that is built separately. The compiler
generates intermediate les with dierent lename extensions to use as it advances
through the compilation stages. The linker takes a collection of compiled units and

448
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
produces a standalone executable or library archive that can be reused by other appli-
cations.
The overall compilation pipeline looks like this:
Notice that the pipeline branches toward the end. OCaml has multiple compiler
backends that reuse the early stages of compilation but produce very dierent nal
outputs. The bytecode can be run by a portable interpreter and can even be transformed
into JavaScript (via js_of_ocaml1) or C source code (via OCamlCC2). The native
code compiler generates specialized executable binaries suitable for high-performance
applications.
26.1.1
Obtaining the Compiler Source Code
Although it's not necessary to understand the examples, you may nd it useful to have
a copy of the OCaml source tree checked out while you read through this chapter. The
source code is available from multiple places:
1 http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml
2 https://github.com/ocaml-bytes/ocamlcc

26.2 Syntax Errors
449
• Stable releases as zip and tar archives from the OCaml download site3
• A Git repository with all the history and development branches included, browsable
online at GitHub4
The source tree is split up into subdirectories. The core compiler consists of:
asmcomp/ Native-code compiler that converts OCaml into high performance native
code executables.
bytecomp/ Bytecode compiler that converts OCaml into an interpreted executable
format.
driver/ Command-line interfaces for the compiler tools.
file_formats/ Serializer and deserializers for on-disk les used by the compiler
driver.
lambda/ The lambda conversion pass.
middle_end/ The clambda, closure and ambda passes.
parsing/ The OCaml lexer, parser, and libraries for manipulating them.
runtime/ The runtime library with the garbage collector.
typing/ The static type checking implementation and type denitions.
A number of tools and scripts are also built alongside the core compiler:
debugger/ The interactive bytecode debugger.
toplevel/ Interactive top-level console.
stdlib/ The compiler standard library, including the Pervasives module.
otherlibs/ Optional libraries such as the Unix and graphics modules.
tools/ Command-line utilities such as ocamldep that are installed with the compiler.
testsuite/ Regression tests for the core compiler.
We'll go through each of the compilation stages now and explain how they will be
useful to you during day-to-day OCaml development.
26.2
Parsing Source Code
When a source le is passed to the OCaml compiler, its rst task is to parse the text into a
more structured abstract syntax tree (AST). The parsing logic is implemented in OCaml
itself using the techniques described earlier in Chapter 20 (Parsing with OCamllex and
Menhir). The lexer and parser rules can be found in the parsing directory in the source
distribution.
26.2.1
Syntax Errors
The OCaml parser's goal is to output a well-formed AST data structure to the next phase
of compilation, and so it fails on any source code that doesn't match basic syntactic
3 http://ocaml.org/docs/install.html
4 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml

450
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
requirements. The compiler emits a syntax error in this situation, with a pointer to the
lename and line and character number that's as close to the error as possible.
Here's an example syntax error that we obtain by performing a module assignment
as a statement instead of as a let binding:
let () =
module MyString = String;
()
The code results in a syntax error when compiled:
$ ocamlc -c broken_module.ml
File "broken_module.ml", line 2, characters 2-8:
2 |
module MyString = String;
^^^^^^
Error: Syntax error
[2]
The correct version of this source code creates the MyString module correctly via
a local open, and compiles successfully:
let () =
let module MyString = String in
()
The syntax error points to the line and character number of the rst token that
couldn't be parsed. In the broken example, the module keyword isn't a valid token at
that point in parsing, so the error location information is correct.
26.2.2
Generating Documentation from Interfaces
Whitespace and source code comments are removed during parsing and aren't signi-
cant in determining the semantics of the program. However, other tools in the OCaml
distribution can interpret comments for their own ends.
OCaml uses specially formatted comments in the source code to generate docu-
mentation bundles. These comments are combined with the function denitions and
signatures, and output as structured documentation in a variety of formats. Tools
such as odoc and ocamldoc can generate HTML pages, LaTeX and PDF documents,
UNIX manual pages, and even module dependency graphs that can be viewed using
Graphviz5.
Here's a sample of some source code that's been annotated with docstring comments:
(** The first special comment of the file is the comment associated
with the whole module. *)
(** Comment for exception My_exception. *)
exception My_exception of (int -> int) * int
(** Comment for type [weather]
*)
type weather =
| Rain of int (** The comment for constructor Rain *)
5 http://www.graphviz.org

26.3 Extension Attributes
451
| Sun
(** The comment for constructor Sun *)
(** Find the current weather for a country
@author Anil Madhavapeddy
@param location The country to get the weather for.
*)
let what_is_the_weather_in location =
match location with
| `Cambridge
-> Rain 100
| `New_york
-> Rain 20
| `California -> Sun
The docstrings are distinguished by beginning with the double asterisk. There are
formatting conventions for the contents of the comment to mark metadata. For instance,
the @tag elds mark specic properties such as the author of that section of code.
There are two main tools used to manipulate docstring comments: the ocamldoc
tool that is supplied with the compiler, and the odoc tool that is developed outside the
compiler but is intended to be the long-term replacement. Try compiling the HTML
documentation and UNIX man pages by running ocamldoc over the source le:
$ mkdir -p html man/man3
$ ocamldoc -html -d html doc.ml
$ ocamldoc -man -d man/man3 doc.ml
$ man -M man Doc
You should now have HTML les inside the html/ directory and also be able to view
the UNIX manual pages held in man/man3. There are quite a few comment formats and
options to control the output for the various backends. Refer to the OCaml manual6
for the complete list.
You can also use odoc to generate complete snapshots of your project via integration
with dune, as described earlier in Chapter 22.2.2 (Browsing Interface Documentation).
26.3
Preprocessing with ppx
One powerful feature in OCaml is a facility to extend the standard language via
extension points. These represent placeholders in the OCaml syntax tree and are
ignored by the standard compiler tooling, beyond being delimited and stored in the
abstract syntax tree alongside the normal parsed source code. They are intended to
be expanded by external tools that select extension nodes that can interpret them. The
external tools can choose to generate further OCaml code by transforming the input
syntax tree, thus forming the basis of an extensible preprocessor for the language.
There are two primary forms of extension points in OCaml: attributes and extension
nodes. Let's rst run through some examples of what they look like, and then see how
to use them in your own code.
6 https://ocaml.org/manual/native.html

452
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
26.3.1
Extension Attributes
Attributes supply additional information that is attached to a node in the OCaml syntax
tree, and subsequently interpreted and expanded by external tools.
The basic form of an attribute is the [@ ... ] syntax. The number of @ symbols
denes which part of the syntax tree the attribute is bound to:
• a single [@ binds using a postx notation to algebraic categories such as expressions
or individual constructors in type denitions.
• a double [@@ binds to blocks of code, such as module denitions, type declarations
or class elds.
• a triple [@@@ appears as a standalone entry in a module implementation or signature,
and are not tied to any specic source code node.
The OCaml compiler has some useful builtin attributes that we can use to illustrate
their use without requiring any external tools. Let's rst look at the use of the standalone
attribute @@@warning to toggle an OCaml compiler warning.
# module Abc = struct
[@@@warning "+non-unit-statement"]
let a = Sys.get_argv (); ()
[@@@warning "-non-unit-statement"]
let b = Sys.get_argv (); ()
end;;
Line 4, characters 11-26:
Warning 10 [non-unit-statement]: this expression should have type
unit.
module Abc : sig val a : unit val b : unit end
The warning in our example is taken from the compiler manual page7. This warning
emits a message if the expression in a sequence doesn't have type unit. The @@@warning
nodes in the module implementation cause the compiler to change its behavior within
the scope of that structure only.
An annotation can also be more narrowly attached to a block of code. For example, a
module implementation can be annotated with @@deprecated to indicate that it should
not be used in new code:
# module Planets = struct
let earth = true
let pluto = true
end [@@deprecated "Sorry, Pluto is no longer a planet. Use the
Planets2016 module instead."];;
module Planets : sig val earth : bool val pluto : bool end
# module Planets2016 = struct
let earth = true
let pluto = false
end;;
module Planets2016 : sig val earth : bool val pluto : bool end
7 https://ocaml.org/manual/native.html

26.3 Extension Nodes
453
In this example, the @@deprecated annotation is only attached to the Planets module,
and the human-readable argument string redirects developers to the newer code. Now
if we try to use the value that has been marked as deprecated, the compiler will issue
a warning.
# let is_pluto_a_planet = Planets.pluto;;
Line 1, characters 25-38:
Alert deprecated: module Planets
Sorry, Pluto is no longer a planet. Use the Planets2016 module
instead.
val is_pluto_a_planet : bool = true
# let is_pluto_a_planet = Planets2016.pluto;;
val is_pluto_a_planet : bool = false
Finally, an attribute can also be attached to an individual expression. In the next
example, the @warn_on_literal_pattern attribute indicates that the argument to the
type constructor should not be pattern matched upon with a constant literal.
# type program_result =
| Error of string [@warn_on_literal_pattern]
| Exit_code of int;;
type program_result = Error of string | Exit_code of int
# let exit_with = function
| Error "It blew up" -> 1
| Exit_code code -> code
| Error _ -> 100;;
Line 2, characters 11-23:
Warning 52 [fragile-literal-pattern]: Code should not depend on the
actual values of
this constructor's arguments. They are only for information
and may change in future versions. (See manual section 11.5)
val exit_with : program_result -> int = <fun>
26.3.2
Commonly Used Extension Attributes
We have already used extension points in Chapter 21 (Data Serialization with S-
Expressions) to generate boilerplate code for handling s-expressions. These are in-
troduced by a third-party library using the (preprocess) directive in a dune le, for
example:
(library
(name hello_world)
(libraries core)
(preprocess (pps ppx_jane))
This allows you to take advantage of a community of syntax augmentation. There
are also a number of builtin attributes in the core OCaml compiler. Some are perfor-
mance oriented and give directives to the compiler, whereas others will activate usage
warnings. The full list is available in the attributes section8 of the OCaml manual.
8 https://ocaml.org/manual/attributes.html

454
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
26.3.3
Extension Nodes
While extension points are useful for annotating existing source code, we also need a
mechanism to store generic placeholders within the OCaml AST for code generation.
OCaml provides this facility via the extension node syntax.
The general syntax for an extension node is [%id expr], where id is an identier
for a particular extension node rewriter and expr is the payload for the rewriter to parse.
An inx form is also available when the payload is of the same kind of syntax. For
example let%foo bar = 1 is equivalent to [%foo let bar = 1].
We've already seen extension nodes in use via the Core syntax extensions earlier
in the book, where they act as syntactic sugar for error handling (let%bind), for
command-line parsing (let%map) or inline testing (let%expect_test). Extension nodes
are introduced via dune rules in the same fashion as extension attributes, via the
(preprocess) attribute.
26.4
Static Type Checking
After obtaining a valid abstract syntax tree, the compiler has to verify that the code
obeys the rules of the OCaml type system. Code that is syntactically correct but misuses
values is rejected with an explanation of the problem.
Although type checking is done in a single pass in OCaml, it actually consists of
three distinct steps that happen simultaneously:
automatic type inference An algorithm that calculates types for a module without
requiring manual type annotations
module system Combines software components with explicit knowledge of their type
signatures
explicit subtyping Checks for objects and polymorphic variants
Automatic type inference lets you write succinct code for a particular task and have
the compiler ensure that your use of variables is locally consistent.
Type inference doesn't scale to very large codebases that depend on separate com-
pilation of les. A small change in one module may ripple through thousands of other
les and libraries and require all of them to be recompiled. The module system solves
this by providing the facility to combine and manipulate explicit type signatures for
modules within a large project, and also to reuse them via functors and rst-class
modules.
Subtyping in OCaml objects is always an explicit operation (via the :> operator).
This means that it doesn't complicate the core type inference engine and can be tested
as a separate concern.

26.4 Displaying Inferred Types from the Compiler
455
26.4.1
Displaying Inferred Types from the Compiler
We've already seen how you can explore type inference directly from the toplevel. It's
also possible to generate type signatures for an entire le by asking the compiler to do
the work for you. Create a le with a single type denition and value:
type t = Foo | Bar
let v = Foo
Now run the compiler with the -i ag to infer the type signature for that le. This
runs the type checker but doesn't compile the code any further after displaying the
interface to the standard output:
$ ocamlc -i typedef.ml
type t = Foo | Bar
val v : t
The output is the default signature for the module that represents the input le. It's
often useful to redirect this output to an mli le to give you a starting signature to edit
the external interface without having to type it all in by hand.
The compiler stores a compiled version of the interface as a cmi le. This interface
is either obtained from compiling an mli signature le for a module, or by the inferred
type if there is only an ml implementation present.
The compiler makes sure that your ml and mli les have compatible signatures. The
type checker throws an immediate error if this isn't the case. For example, if you have
this as your ml le:
type t = Foo
and this as your mli:
type t = Bar
then, when you try to build, you'll get this error:
$ ocamlc -c conflicting_interface.mli conflicting_interface.ml
File "conflicting_interface.ml", line 1:
Error: The implementation conflicting_interface.ml
does not match the interface conflicting_interface.cmi:
Type declarations do not match:
type t = Foo
is not included in
type t = Bar
Constructors number 1 have different names, Foo and Bar.
File "conflicting_interface.mli", line 1, characters 0-12:
Expected declaration
File "conflicting_interface.ml", line 1, characters 0-12:
Actual declaration
[2]
Which Comes First: The ml or the mli?
There are two schools of thought on which order OCaml code should be written in. It's
very easy to begin writing code by starting with an ml le and using the type inference

456
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
to guide you as you build up your functions. The mli le can then be generated as
described, and the exported functions documented.
If you're writing code that spans multiple les, it's sometimes easier to start by
writing all the mli signatures and checking that they type-check against one another.
Once the signatures are in place, you can write the implementations with the condence
that they'll all glue together correctly, with no cyclic dependencies among the modules.
As with any such stylistic debate, you should experiment with which system works
best for you. Everyone agrees on one thing though: no matter in what order you write
them, production code should always explicitly dene an mli le for every ml le in
the project. It's also perfectly ne to have an mli le without a corresponding ml le if
you're only declaring signatures (such as module types).
Signature les provide a place to write succinct documentation and to abstract
internal details that shouldn't be exported. Maintaining separate signature les also
speeds up incremental compilation in larger code bases, since recompiling a mli
signature is much faster than a full compilation of the implementation to native code.
26.4.2
Type Inference
Type inference is the process of determining the appropriate types for expressions
based on their use. It's a feature that's partially present in many other languages such
as Haskell and Scala, but OCaml embeds it as a fundamental feature throughout the
core language.
OCaml type inference is based on the Hindley-Milner algorithm, which is notable
for its ability to infer the most general type for an expression without requiring any
explicit type annotations. The algorithm can deduce multiple types for an expression
and has the notion of a principal type that is the most general choice from the possible
inferences. Manual type annotations can specialize the type explicitly, but the automatic
inference selects the most general type unless told otherwise.
OCaml does have some language extensions that strain the limits of principal type
inference, but by and large, most programs you write will never require annotations
(although they sometimes help the compiler produce better error messages).
Adding Type Annotations to Find Errors
It's often said that the hardest part of writing OCaml code is getting past the type
checkerbut once the code does compile, it works correctly the rst time! This is an
exaggeration of course, but it can certainly feel true when moving from a dynamically
typed language. The OCaml static type system protects you from certain classes of
bugs such as memory errors and abstraction violations by rejecting your program
at compilation time rather than by generating an error at runtime. Learning how to
navigate the type checker's compile-time feedback is key to building robust libraries
and applications that take full advantage of these static checks.
There are a couple of tricks to make it easier to quickly locate type errors in your
code. The rst is to introduce manual type annotations to narrow down the source of

26.4 Adding Type Annotations to Find Errors
457
your error more accurately. These annotations shouldn't actually change your types
and can be removed once your code is correct. However, they act as anchors to locate
errors while you're still writing your code.
Manual type annotations are particularly useful if you use lots of polymorphic
variants or objects. Type inference with row polymorphism can generate some very
large signatures, and errors tend to propagate more widely than if you are using more
explicitly typed variants or classes.
For instance, consider this broken example that expresses some simple algebraic
operations over integers:
let rec algebra =
function
| `Add (x,y) -> (algebra x) + (algebra y)
| `Sub (x,y) -> (algebra x) - (algebra y)

There's a single character typo in the code so that it uses Nu instead of Num. The
resulting type error is impressive:

The type error is perfectly accurate, but rather verbose and with a line number that
doesn't point to the exact location of the incorrect variant name. The best the compiler
can do is to point you in the general direction of the algebra function application.
This is because the type checker doesn't have enough information to match the
inferred type of the algebra denition to its application a few lines down. It calculates
types for both expressions separately, and when they don't match up, outputs the
dierence as best it can.
Let's see what happens with an explicit type annotation to help the compiler out:
type t = [
| `Add of t * t
| `Sub of t * t
| `Mul of t * t
| `Num of int
]
let rec algebra (x:t) =
match x with
| `Add (x,y) -> (algebra x) + (algebra y)
| `Sub (x,y) -> (algebra x) - (algebra y)

-> x
let _ =
algebra (
`Add (
(`Num 0),
(`Sub (
(`Num 1),
(`Mul (
(`Nu 3),(`Num 2)
))
))
))
This code contains exactly the same error as before, but we've added a closed type
denition of the polymorphic variants, and a type annotation to the algebra denition.
The compiler error we get is much more useful now:
$ ocamlc -i broken_poly_with_annot.ml
File "broken_poly_with_annot.ml", line 22, characters 14-21:

26.4 Enforcing Principal Typing
459
This error points directly to the correct line number that contains the typo. Once you
x the problem, you can remove the manual annotations if you prefer more succinct
code. You can also leave the annotations there, of course, to help with future refactoring
and debugging.
Enforcing Principal Typing
The compiler also has a stricter principal type checking mode that is activated via the
-principal ag. This warns about risky uses of type information to ensure that the
type inference has one principal result. A type is considered risky if the success or
failure of type inference depends on the order in which subexpressions are typed.
The principality check only aects a few language features:
• Polymorphic methods for objects
• Permuting the order of labeled arguments in a function from their type denition
• Discarding optional labeled arguments
• Generalized algebraic data types (GADTs) present from OCaml 4.0 onward
• Automatic disambiguation of record eld and constructor names (since OCaml 4.1)
Here's an example of principality warnings when used with record disambiguation.
type s = { foo: int; bar: unit }
type t = { foo: int }
let f x =
x.bar;
x.foo
Inferring the signature with -principal will show you a new warning:
$ ocamlc -i -principal non_principal.ml
File "non_principal.ml", line 6, characters 4-7:
6 |
x.foo
^^^
Warning 18 [not-principal]: this type-based field disambiguation is
not principal.
type s = { foo : int; bar : unit; }
type t = { foo : int; }
val f : s -> int
This example isn't principal, since the inferred type for x.foo is guided by the
inferred type of x.bar, whereas principal typing requires that each subexpression's
type can be calculated independently. If the x.bar use is removed from the denition
of f, its argument would be of type t and not type s.
You can x this either by permuting the order of the type declarations, or by adding
an explicit type annotation:
type s = { foo: int; bar: unit }
type t = { foo: int }
let f (x:s) =
x.bar;
x.foo

460
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
There is now no ambiguity about the inferred types, since we've explicitly given the
argument a type, and the order of inference of the subexpressions no longer matters.
$ ocamlc -i -principal principal.ml
type s = { foo : int; bar : unit; }
type t = { foo : int; }
val f : s -> int
The dune equivalent is to add the ag -principal to your build description.
(executable
(name principal)
(flags :standard -principal)
(modules principal))
(executable
(name non_principal)
(flags :standard -principal)
(modules non_principal))
The :standard directive will include all the default ags, and then -principal will
be appended after those in the compiler build ags.
$ dune build principal.exe
$ dune build non_principal.exe
File "non_principal.ml", line 6, characters 4-7:
6 |
x.foo
^^^
Error (warning 18 [not-principal]): this type-based field
disambiguation is not principal.
[1]
Ideally, all code should systematically use -principal. It reduces variance in type
inference and enforces the notion of a single known type. However, there are drawbacks
to this mode: type inference is slower, and the cmi les become larger. This is generally
only a problem if you extensively use objects, which usually have larger type signatures
to cover all their methods.
If compiling in principal mode works, it is guaranteed that the program will pass
type checking in non-principal mode, too. Bear in mind that the cmi les generated
in principal mode dier from the default mode. Try to ensure that you compile your
whole project with it activated. Getting the les mixed up won't let you violate type
safety, but it can result in the type checker failing unexpectedly very occasionally. In
this case, just recompile with a clean source tree.
26.4.3
Modules and Separate Compilation
The OCaml module system enables smaller components to be reused eectively in large
projects while still retaining all the benets of static type safety. We covered the basics
of using modules earlier in Chapter 5 (Files, Modules, and Programs). The module
language that operates over these signatures also extends to functors and rst-class
modules, described in Chapter 11 (Functors) and Chapter 12 (First-Class Modules),
respectively.

26.4 Dening a Module Search Path
461
This section discusses how the compiler implements them in more detail. Modules
are essential for larger projects that consist of many source les (also known as com-
pilation units). It's impractical to recompile every single source le when changing
just one or two les, and the module system minimizes such recompilation while still
encouraging code reuse.
The Mapping Between Files and Modules
Individual compilation units provide a convenient way to break up a big module
hierarchy into a collection of les. The relationship between les and modules can be
explained directly in terms of the module system.
Create a le called alice.ml with the following contents:
let friends = [ Bob.name ]
and a corresponding signature le:
val friends : Bob.t list
These two les produce essentially the same result as the following code.
module Alice : sig
val friends : Bob.t list
end = struct
let friends = [ Bob.name ]
end
Dening a Module Search Path
In the preceding example, Alice also has a reference to another module Bob. For the
overall type of Alice to be valid, the compiler also needs to check that the Bob module
contains at least a Bob.name value and denes a Bob.t type.
The type checker resolves such module references into concrete structures and
signatures in order to unify types across module boundaries. It does this by searching
a list of directories for a compiled interface le matching that module's name. For
example, it will look for alice.cmi and bob.cmi on the search path and use the rst
ones it encounters as the interfaces for Alice and Bob.
The module search path is set by adding -I ags to the compiler command line with
the directory containing the cmi les as the argument. Manually specifying these ags
gets complex when you have lots of libraries, and is the reason why tools like dune
and ocamlfind exist. They both automate the process of turning third-party package
names and build descriptions into command-line ags that are passed to the compiler
command line.
By default, only the current directory and the OCaml standard library will be
searched for cmi les. The Stdlib module from the standard library will also be
opened by default in every compilation unit. The standard library location is obtained
by running ocamlc -where and can be overridden by setting the CAMLLIB environment
variable. Needless to say, don't override the default path unless you have a good reason
to (such as setting up a cross-compilation environment).

462
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
Inspecting Compilation Units with ocamlobjinfo
For separate compilation to be sound, we need to ensure that all the cmi les used to
type-check a module are the same across compilation runs. If they vary, this raises the
possibility of two modules checking dierent type signatures for a common module
with the same name. This in turn lets the program completely violate the static type
system and can lead to memory corruption and crashes.
OCaml guards against this by recording a MD5 checksum in every cmi. Let's
examine our earlier typedef.ml more closely:
$ ocamlc -c typedef.ml
$ ocamlobjinfo typedef.cmi
File typedef.cmi
Unit name: Typedef
Interfaces imported:
cdd43318ee9dd1b187513a4341737717
Typedef
9b04ecdc97e5102c1d342892ef7ad9a2
Pervasives
79ae8c0eb753af6b441fe05456c7970b
CamlinternalFormatBasics
ocamlobjinfo examines the compiled interface and displays what other compila-
tion units it depends on. In this case, we don't use any external modules other than
Pervasives. Every module depends on Pervasives by default, unless you use the
-nopervasives ag (this is an advanced use case, and you shouldn't normally need it).
The long alphanumeric identier beside each module name is a hash calculated
from all the types and values exported from that compilation unit. It's used during type-
checking and linking to ensure that all of the compilation units have been compiled
consistently against one another. A dierence in the hashes means that a compilation
unit with the same module name may have conicting type signatures in dierent
modules. The compiler will reject such programs with an error similar to this:
$ ocamlc -c foo.ml
File "foo.ml", line 1, characters 0-1:
Error: The files /home/build/bar.cmi
and /usr/lib/ocaml/map.cmi make inconsistent assumptions
over interface Map
This hash check is very conservative, but ensures that separate compilation remains
type-safe all the way up to the nal link phase. Your build system should ensure that
you never see the preceding error messages, but if you do run into it, just clean out
your intermediate les and recompile from scratch.
26.4.4
Wrapping Libraries with Module Aliases
The module-to-le mapping described so far rigidly enforces a 1:1 mapping between
a top-level module and a le. It's often convenient to split larger modules into separate
les to make editing easier, but still compile them all into a single OCaml module.
Dune provides a very convenient way of doing this for libraries via automatically
generating a toplevel module alias le that places all the les in a given library as

26.4 Wrapping Libraries with Module Aliases
463
submodules within the toplevel module for that library. This is known as wrapping the
library, and works as follows.
Let's dene a simple library with two les a.ml and b.ml that each dene a single
value.
let v = "hello"
let w = 42
The dune le denes a library called hello that includes these two modules.
(library
(name hello)
(modules a b))
(executable
(name test)
(libraries hello)
(modules test))
If we now build this library, we can look at how dune assembles the modules into a
Hello library.
$ dune build
$ cat _build/default/hello.ml-gen
(** @canonical Hello.A *)
module A = Hello__A
(** @canonical Hello.B *)
module B = Hello__B
Dune has generated a hello.ml le which forms the toplevel module exposed by
the library. It has also renamed the individual modules into internal mangled names
such as Hello__A, and assigned those internal modules as aliases within the generated
hello.ml le. This then allows a user of this library to access the values as Hello.A.
For example, our test executable contains this:
let v = Hello.A.v
let w = Hello.B.w
One nice aspect about this module alias scheme is that a single toplevel module
provides a central place to write documentation about how to use all the submodules
exposed by the library. We can manually add a hello.ml and hello.mli to our library
that does exactly this. First add the hello module to the dune le:
(library
(name hello)
(modules a b hello))
(executable
(name test)
(libraries hello)
(modules test))
Then the hello.ml le contains the module aliases (and any other code you might
want to add to the toplevel module).

464
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
module A = A
module B = B
Finally, the hello.mli interface le can reference all the submodules and include
documentation strings:
(** Documentation for module A *)
module A : sig
(** [v] is Hello *)
val v : string
end
(** Documentation for module B *)
module B : sig
(** [w] is 42 *)
val w : int
end
If you want to disable this behavior of dune and deliberately include multiple
toplevel modules, you can add (wrapped false) to your libraries stanza. However,
this is discouraged in general due to the increased likelihood of linking clashes when
you have a lot of library dependencies, since every module that is linked into an
executable must have a unique name in OCaml.
26.4.5
Shorter Module Paths in Type Errors
Core uses the OCaml module system quite extensively to provide a complete replace-
ment standard library. It collects these modules into a single Std module, which
provides a single module that needs to be opened to import the replacement modules
and functions.
There's one downside to this approach: type errors suddenly get much more verbose.
We can see this if you run the vanilla OCaml toplevel (not utop).
$ ocaml
# List.map print_endline "";;
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
string list
This type error without Core has a straightforward type error. When we switch to
Core, though, it gets more verbose:
$ ocaml
# open Core;;
# List.map ~f:print_endline "";;
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
'a Core.List.t = 'a list
The default List module in OCaml is overridden by Core.List. The compiler does
its best to show the type equivalence, but at the cost of a more verbose error message.
The compiler can remedy this via a so-called short paths heuristic. This causes the
compiler to search all the type aliases for the shortest module path and use that as the

26.5 Examining the Typed Syntax Tree Directly
465
preferred output type. The option is activated by passing -short-paths to the compiler,
and works on the toplevel, too.
$ ocaml -short-paths
# open Core;;
# List.map ~f:print_endline "foo";;
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected
of type
'a list
The utop enhanced toplevel activates short paths by default, which is why we have
not had to do this before in our interactive examples. However, the compiler doesn't
default to the short path heuristic, since there are some situations where the type
aliasing information is useful to know, and it would be lost in the error if the shortest
module path is always picked.
You'll need to choose for yourself if you prefer short paths or the default behavior
in your own projects, and pass the -short-paths ag to the compiler if you need
26.5
The Typed Syntax Tree
When the type checking process has successfully completed, it is combined with the
AST to form a typed abstract syntax tree. This contains precise location information for
every token in the input le, and decorates each token with concrete type information.
The compiler can output this as compiled cmt and cmti les that contain the typed
AST for the implementation and signatures of a compilation unit. This is activated by
passing the -bin-annot ag to the compiler.
The cmt les are particularly useful for IDE tools to match up OCaml source
code at a specic location to the inferred or external types. For example, the merlin
and ocaml-lsp-server opam packages both use this information to provide you with
tooltips and docstrings within your editor, as described earlier in Chapter 22.2.1 (Using
Visual Studio Code).
26.5.1
Examining the Typed Syntax Tree Directly
The compiler has a couple of advanced ags that can dump the raw output of the
internal AST representation. You can't depend on these ags to give the same output
across compiler revisions, but they are a useful learning tool.
We'll use our toy typedef.ml again:
type t = Foo | Bar
let v = Foo
Let's rst look at the untyped syntax tree that's generated from the parsing phase:
$ ocamlc -dparsetree typedef.ml 2>&1
[
structure_item (typedef.ml[1,0+0]..[1,0+18])
Pstr_type Rec

466
The Compiler Frontend: Parsing and Type Checking
[
type_declaration "t" (typedef.ml[1,0+5]..[1,0+6])
(typedef.ml[1,0+0]..[1,0+18])
ptype_params =
[]
ptype_cstrs =
[]
ptype_kind =
Ptype_variant
[
(typedef.ml[1,0+9]..[1,0+12])
"Foo" (typedef.ml[1,0+9]..[1,0+12])
[]
None
(typedef.ml[1,0+13]..[1,0+18])
"Bar" (typedef.ml[1,0+15]..[1,0+18])
[]
None
]
ptype_private = Public
ptype_manifest =
None
]
structure_item (typedef.ml[2,19+0]..[2,19+11])
Pstr_value Nonrec
[
<def>
pattern (typedef.ml[2,19+4]..[2,19+5])
Ppat_var "v" (typedef.ml[2,19+4]..[2,19+5])
expression (typedef.ml[2,19+8]..[2,19+11])
Pexp_construct "Foo" (typedef.ml[2,19+8]..[2,19+11])
None
]
]
This is rather a lot of output for a simple two-line program, but it shows just how
much structure the OCaml parser generates even from a small source le.
Each portion of the AST is decorated with the precise location information (in-
cluding the lename and character location of the token). This code hasn't been type
checked yet, so the raw tokens are all included.
The typed AST that is normally output as a compiled cmt le can be displayed in a
more developer-readable form via the -dtypedtree option:
$ ocamlc -dtypedtree typedef.ml 2>&1
[
structure_item (typedef.ml[1,0+0]..typedef.ml[1,0+18])
Tstr_type Rec
[
type_declaration t/81 (typedef.ml[1,0+0]..typedef.ml[1,0+18])
ptype_params =
[]
ptype_cstrs =
[]
ptype_kind =
Ttype_variant

26.5 Examining the Typed Syntax Tree Directly
467
[
(typedef.ml[1,0+9]..typedef.ml[1,0+12])
Foo/82
[]
None
(typedef.ml[1,0+13]..typedef.ml[1,0+18])
Bar/83
[]
None
]
ptype_private = Public
ptype_manifest =
None
]
structure_item (typedef.ml[2,19+0]..typedef.ml[2,19+11])
Tstr_value Nonrec
[
<def>
pattern (typedef.ml[2,19+4]..typedef.ml[2,19+5])
Tpat_var "v/84"
expression (typedef.ml[2,19+8]..typedef.ml[2,19+11])
Texp_construct "Foo"
[]
]
]
The typed AST is more explicit than the untyped syntax tree. For instance, the type
declaration has been given a unique name (t/1008), as has the v value (v/1011).
You'll rarely need to look at this raw output from the compiler unless you're building
IDE tools, or are hacking on extensions to the core compiler itself. However, it's
useful to know that this intermediate form exists before we delve further into the code
generation process next, in Chapter 27 (The Compiler Backend: Bytecode and Native
code).
There are several new integrated tools emerging that combine these typed AST les
with common editors such as Emacs or Vim. The best of these is Merlin9, which adds
value and module autocompletion, displays inferred types and can build and display
errors directly from within your editor. There are instructions available on its homepage
for conguring Merlin with your favorite editor, or its bigger sibling ocaml-lsp-server
is described earlier in Chapter 22.2.1 (Using Visual Studio Code).

27
The Compiler Backend: Bytecode
and Native code
Once OCaml has passed the type checking stage, it can stop emitting syntax and type
errors and begin the process of compiling the well-formed modules into executable
code.
In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:
• The untyped intermediate lambda code where pattern matching is optimized
• The bytecode ocamlc compiler and ocamlrun interpreter
• The native code ocamlopt code generator, and debugging and proling native code
27.1
The Untyped Lambda Form
The rst code generation phase eliminates all the static type information into a simpler
intermediate lambda form. The lambda form discards higher-level constructs such as
modules and objects and replaces them with simpler values such as records and func-
tion pointers. Pattern matches are also analyzed and compiled into highly optimized
automata.
The lambda form is the key stage that discards the OCaml type information and
maps the source code to the runtime memory model described in Chapter 24 (Memory
Representation of Values). This stage also performs some optimizations, most notably
converting pattern-match statements into more optimized but low-level statements.
27.1.1
Pattern Matching Optimization
The compiler dumps the lambda form in an s-expression syntax if you add the -dlambda
directive to the command line. Let's use this to learn more about how the OCaml pattern-
matching engine works by building three dierent pattern matches and comparing their
lambda forms.
Let's start by creating a straightforward exhaustive pattern match using four normal
variants:
type t = | Alice | Bob | Charlie | David
let test v =
match v with
| Alice
-> 100

27.1 Pattern Matching Optimization
469
| Bob
-> 101
| Charlie -> 102
| David
-> 103
The lambda output for this code looks like this:
$ ocamlc -dlambda -c pattern_monomorphic_large.ml 2>&1
(setglobal Pattern_monomorphic_large!
(let
(test/86 =
(function v/88 : int
(switch* v/88
case int 0: 100
case int 1: 101
case int 2: 102
case int 3: 103)))
(makeblock 0 test/86)))
It's not important to understand every detail of this internal form, and it is explicitly
undocumented since it can change across compiler revisions. Despite these caveats,
some interesting points emerge from reading it:
• There are no mentions of modules or types any more. Global values are created via
setglobal, and OCaml values are constructed by makeblock. The blocks are the
runtime values you should remember from Chapter 24 (Memory Representation
of Values).
• The pattern match has turned into a switch case that jumps to the right case depending
on the header tag of v. Recall that variants without parameters are stored in
memory as integers in the order in which they appear. The pattern-matching
engine knows this and has transformed the pattern into an ecient jump table.
• Values are addressed by a unique name that distinguishes shadowed values by ap-
pending a number (e.g., v/1014). The type safety checks in the earlier phase
ensure that these low-level accesses never violate runtime memory safety, so this
layer doesn't do any dynamic checks. Unwise use of unsafe features such as the
Obj.magic module can still easily induce crashes at this level.
The compiler computes a jump table in order to handle all four cases. If we drop the
number of variants to just two, then there's no need for the complexity of computing
this table:
type t = | Alice | Bob
let test v =
match v with
| Alice
-> 100
| Bob
-> 101
The lambda output for this code is now quite dierent:
$ ocamlc -dlambda -c pattern_monomorphic_small.ml 2>&1
(setglobal Pattern_monomorphic_small!
(let (test/84 = (function v/86 : int (if v/86 101 100)))
(makeblock 0 test/84)))

470
The Compiler Backend: Bytecode and Native code
The compiler emits simpler conditional jumps rather than setting up a jump table,
since it statically determines that the range of possible variants is small enough. Finally,
let's consider code that's essentially the same as our rst pattern match example, but
with polymorphic variants instead of normal variants:
let test v =
match v with
| `Alice
-> 100
| `Bob
-> 101
| `Charlie -> 102
| `David
-> 103
The lambda form for this also reects the runtime representation of polymorphic
variants:
$ ocamlc -dlambda -c pattern_polymorphic.ml 2>&1
(setglobal Pattern_polymorphic!
(let
(test/81 =
(function v/83 : int
(if (>= v/83 482771474) (if (>= v/83 884917024) 100 102)
(if (>= v/83 3306965) 101 103))))
(makeblock 0 test/81)))
We mentioned in Chapter 7 (Variants) that pattern matching over polymorphic
variants is slightly less ecient, and it should be clearer why this is the case now.
Polymorphic variants have a runtime value that's calculated by hashing the variant
name, and so the compiler can't use a jump table as it does for normal variants. Instead,
it creates a decision tree that compares the hash values against the input variable in as
few comparisons as possible.
Pattern matching is an important part of OCaml programming. You'll often en-
counter deeply nested pattern matches over complex data structures in real code. A
good paper that describes the fundamental algorithms implemented in OCaml is Op-
timizing pattern matching1 by Fabrice Le Fessant and Luc Maranget.
The paper describes the backtracking algorithm used in classical pattern matching
compilation, and also several OCaml-specic optimizations, such as the use of ex-
haustiveness information and control ow optimizations via static exceptions. It's not
essential that you understand all of this just to use pattern matching, of course, but it'll
give you insight as to why pattern matching is such an ecient language construct in
OCaml.
27.1.2
Benchmarking Pattern Matching
Let's benchmark these three pattern-matching techniques to quantify their runtime costs
more accurately. The Core_bench module runs the tests thousands of times and also
calculates statistical variance of the results. You'll need to opam install core_bench
to get the library:

These results conrm the performance hypothesis that we obtained earlier by in-
specting the lambda code. The shortest running time comes from the small conditional
pattern match, and polymorphic variant pattern matching is the slowest. There isn't a
hugely signicant dierence in these examples, but you can use the same techniques
to peer into the innards of your own source code and narrow down any performance
hotspots.
The lambda form is primarily a stepping stone to the bytecode executable format
that we'll cover next. It's often easier to look at the textual output from this stage than
to wade through the native assembly code from compiled executables.
27.2
Generating Portable Bytecode
After the lambda form has been generated, we are very close to having executable
code. The OCaml toolchain branches into two separate compilers at this point. We'll
describe the bytecode compiler rst, which consists of two pieces:
ocamlc Compiles les into a bytecode that is a close mapping to the lambda form
ocamlrun A portable interpreter that executes the bytecode
The big advantage of using bytecode is simplicity, portability, and compilation
speed. The mapping from the lambda form to bytecode is straightforward, and this
results in predictable (but slow) execution speed.

27.2 Compiling and Linking Bytecode
473
The bytecode interpreter implements a stack-based virtual machine. The OCaml
stack and an associated accumulator store values that consist of:
long Values that correspond to an OCaml int type
block Values that contain the block header and a memory address with the data elds
that contain further OCaml values indexed by an integer
code oset Values that are relative to the starting code address
The interpreter virtual machine only has seven registers in total: - program counter,
- stack, exception and argument pointers, - accumulator, - environment and global data.
You can display the bytecode instructions in textual form via -dinstr. Try this on
one of our earlier pattern-matching examples:
$ ocamlc -dinstr pattern_monomorphic_small.ml 2>&1
branch L2
L1: acc 0
branchifnot L3
const 101
return 1
L3: const 100
return 1
L2: closure L1, 0
push
acc 0
makeblock 1, 0
pop 1
setglobal Pattern_monomorphic_small!
The preceding bytecode has been simplied from the lambda form into a set of
simple instructions that are executed serially by the interpreter.
There are around 140 instructions in total, but most are just minor variants of
commonly encountered operations (e.g., function application at a specic arity). You
can nd full details online2.
Where Did the Bytecode Instruction Set Come From?
The bytecode interpreter is much slower than compiled native code, but is still remark-
ably performant for an interpreter without a JIT compiler. Its eciency can be traced
back to Xavier Leroy's ground-breaking work in 1990, The ZINC experiment: An
Economical Implementation of the ML Language.a
This paper laid the theoretical basis for the implementation of an instruction set
for a strictly evaluated functional language such as OCaml. The bytecode interpreter
in modern OCaml is still based on the ZINC model. The native code compiler uses a
dierent model since it uses CPU registers for function calls instead of always passing
arguments on the stack, as the bytecode interpreter does.
Understanding the reasoning behind the dierent implementations of the bytecode
interpreter and the native compiler is a very useful exercise for any budding language
hacker.

474
The Compiler Backend: Bytecode and Native code
27.2.1
Compiling and Linking Bytecode
The ocamlc command compiles individual ml les into bytecode les that have a cmo
extension. The compiled bytecode les are matched with the associated cmi interface,
which contains the type signature exported to other compilation units.
A typical OCaml library consists of multiple source les, and hence multiple cmo
les that all need to be passed as command-line arguments to use the library from
other code. The compiler can combine these multiple les into a more convenient
single archive le by using the -a ag. Bytecode archives are denoted by the cma
extension.
The individual objects in the library are linked as regular cmo les in the order
specied when the library le was built. If an object le within the library isn't
referenced elsewhere in the program, then it isn't included in the nal binary unless
the -linkall ag forces its inclusion. This behavior is analogous to how C handles
object les and archives (.o and .a, respectively).
The bytecode les are then linked together with the OCaml standard library to
produce an executable program. The order in which .cmo arguments are presented
on the command line denes the order in which compilation units are initialized at
runtime. Remember that OCaml has no single main function like C, so this link order
is more important than in C programs.
27.2.2
Executing Bytecode
The bytecode runtime comprises three parts: the bytecode interpreter, GC, and a set of C
functions that implement the primitive operations. The bytecode contains instructions
to call these C functions when required.
The OCaml linker produces bytecode that targets the standard OCaml runtime by
default, and so needs to know about any C functions that are referenced from other
libraries that aren't loaded by default.
Information about these extra libraries can be specied while linking a bytecode
archive:
$ ocamlc -a -o mylib.cma a.cmo b.cmo -dllib -lmylib
The dllib ag embeds the arguments in the archive le. Any subsequent packages
linking this archive will also include the extra C linking directive. This in turn lets
the interpreter dynamically load the external library symbols when it executes the
bytecode.
You can also generate a complete standalone executable that bundles the ocamlrun
interpreter with the bytecode in a single binary. This is known as a custom runtime
mode and is built as follows:
$ ocamlc -a -o mylib.cma -custom a.cmo b.cmo -cclib -lmylib
The custom mode is the most similar mode to native code compilation, as both
generate standalone executables. There are quite a few other options available for

27.2 Embedding OCaml Bytecode in C
475
compiling bytecode (notably with shared libraries or building custom runtimes). Full
details can be found in the OCaml3.
Dune can build a self-contained bytecode executable if you specify the
byte_complete mode in the executable rule. For example, this dune le will gener-
ate a prog.bc.exe target:
(executable
(name prog)
(modules prog)
(modes byte byte_complete))
27.2.3
Embedding OCaml Bytecode in C
A consequence of using the bytecode compiler is that the nal link phase must be
performed by ocamlc. However, you might sometimes want to embed your OCaml
code inside an existing C application. OCaml also supports this mode of operation via
the -output-obj directive.
This mode causes ocamlc to output an object le containing the bytecode for the
OCaml part of the program, as well as a caml_startup function. All of the OCaml
modules are linked into this object le as bytecode, just as they would be for an
executable.
This object le can then be linked with C code using the standard C compiler, needing
only the bytecode runtime library (which is installed as libcamlrun.a). Creating an
executable just requires you to link the runtime library with the bytecode object le.
Here's an example to show how it all ts together.
Create two OCaml source les that contain a single print line:
let () = print_endline "hello embedded world 1"
let () = print_endline "hello embedded world 2"
Next, create a C le to be your main entry point:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <caml/alloc.h>
#include <caml/mlvalues.h>
#include <caml/memory.h>
#include <caml/callback.h>
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
printf("Before calling OCaml\n");
fflush(stdout);
caml_startup (argv);
printf("After calling OCaml\n");
return 0;
}
Now compile the OCaml les into a standalone object le:
3 https://ocaml.org/manual/comp.html#s%3Acomp-options

476
The Compiler Backend: Bytecode and Native code
$ rm -f embed_out.c
$ ocamlc -output-obj -o embed_out.o embed_me1.ml embed_me2.ml
After this point, you no longer need the OCaml compiler, as embed_out.o has all
of the OCaml code compiled and linked into a single object le. Compile an output
binary using gcc to test this out:
$ gcc -fPIC -Wall -I`ocamlc -where` -L`ocamlc -where` -ltermcap -lm
-ldl \
-o finalbc.native main.c embed_out.o -lcamlrun
$ ./finalbc.native
Before calling OCaml
hello embedded world 1
hello embedded world 2
After calling OCaml
You can inspect the commands that ocamlc is invoking by adding -verbose to the
command line to help gure out the GCC command line if you get stuck. You can
even obtain the C source code to the -output-obj result by specifying a .c output le
extension instead of the .o we used earlier:
$ ocamlc -output-obj -o embed_out.c embed_me1.ml embed_me2.ml
Embedding OCaml code like this lets you write OCaml that interfaces with any
environment that works with a C compiler. You can even cross back from the C code
into OCaml by using the Callback module to register named entry points in the OCaml
code. This is explained in detail in the interfacing with C4 section of the OCaml manual.
27.3
Compiling Fast Native Code
The native code compiler is ultimately the tool that most production OCaml code
goes through. It compiles the lambda form into fast native code executables, with
cross-module inlining and additional optimization passes that the bytecode interpreter
doesn't perform. Care is taken to ensure compatibility with the bytecode runtime, so
the same code should run identically when compiled with either toolchain.
The ocamlopt command is the frontend to the native code compiler and has a very
similar interface to ocamlc. It also accepts ml and mli les, but compiles them to:
• A .o le containing native object code
• A .cmx le containing extra information for linking and cross-module optimization
• A .cmi compiled interface le that is the same as the bytecode compiler
When the compiler links modules together into an executable, it uses the contents
of the cmx les to perform cross-module inlining across compilation units. This can be
a signicant speedup for standard library functions that are frequently used outside of
their module.
Collections of .cmx and .o les can also be linked into a .cmxa archive by passing
4 https://ocaml.org/manual/intfc.html

27.3 The Impact of Polymorphic Comparison
477
the -a ag to the compiler. However, unlike the bytecode version, you must keep the
individual cmx les in the compiler search path so that they are available for cross-
module inlining. If you don't do this, the compilation will still succeed, but you will
have missed out on an important optimization and have slower binaries.
27.3.1
Inspecting Assembly Output
The native code compiler generates assembly language that is then passed to the system
assembler for compiling into object les. You can get ocamlopt to output the assembly
by passing the -S ag to the compiler command line.
The assembly code is highly architecture-specic, so the following discussion as-
sumes an Intel or AMD 64-bit platform. We've generated the example code using
-inline 20 and -nodynlink since it's best to generate assembly code with the full
optimizations that the compiler supports. Even though these optimizations make the
code a bit harder to read, it will give you a more accurate picture of what executes on
the CPU. Don't forget that you can use the lambda code from earlier to get a slightly
higher-level picture of the code if you get lost in the more verbose assembly.
The Impact of Polymorphic Comparison
We warned you in Chapter 15 (Maps and Hash Tables) that using polymorphic com-
parison is both convenient and perilous. Let's look at precisely what the dierence is
at the assembly language level now.
First let's create a comparison function where we've explicitly annotated the types,
so the compiler knows that only integers are being compared:
let cmp (a:int) (b:int) =
if a > b then a else b
Now compile this into assembly and read the resulting compare_mono.S le.
$ ocamlopt -S compare_mono.ml
This le extension may be lowercase on some platforms such as Linux. If you've
never seen assembly language before, then the contents may be rather scary. While
you'll need to learn x86 assembly to fully understand it, we'll try to give you some
basic instructions to spot patterns in this section. The excerpt of the implementation
of the cmp function can be found below:
_camlCompare_mono__cmp_1008:
.cfi_startproc
.L101:
cmpq
%rbx, %rax
jle
.L100
ret
.align
2
.L100:
movq
%rbx, %rax
ret
.cfi_endproc

478
The Compiler Backend: Bytecode and Native code
The _camlCompare_mono__cmp_1008 is an assembly label that has been computed
from the module name (Compare_mono) and the function name (cmp_1008). The numeric
sux for the function name comes straight from the lambda form (which you can
inspect using -dlambda, but in this case isn't necessary).
The arguments to cmp are passed in the %rbx and %rax registers, and compared using
the jle jump if less than or equal instruction. This requires both the arguments to be
immediate integers to work. Now let's see what happens if our OCaml code omits the
type annotations and is a polymorphic comparison instead:
let cmp a b =
if a > b then a else b
Compiling this code with -S results in a signicantly more complex assembly output
for the same function:
_camlCompare_poly__cmp_1008:
.cfi_startproc
subq
$24, %rsp
.cfi_adjust_cfa_offset
24
.L101:

%rax, %rdi
movq
%rbx, %rsi

0(%rsp), %rax
addq
$24, %rsp
.cfi_adjust_cfa_offset
-24
ret
.cfi_adjust_cfa_offset
24
.cfi_endproc
The .cfi directives are assembler hints that contain Call Frame Information that
lets the debugger provide more sensible backtraces, and they have no eect on runtime
performance. Notice that the rest of the implementation is no longer a simple register
comparison. Instead, the arguments are pushed on the stack (the %rsp register), and
a C function call is invoked by placing a pointer to caml_greaterthan in %rax and
jumping to caml_c_call.
OCaml on x86_64 architectures caches the location of the minor heap in the %r15
register since it's so frequently referenced in OCaml functions. The minor heap pointer

27.3 Benchmarking Polymorphic Comparison
479
can also be changed by the C code that's being called (e.g., when it allocates OCaml
values), and so %r15 is restored after returning from the caml_greaterthan call. Finally,
the return value of the comparison is popped from the stack and returned.
Benchmarking Polymorphic Comparison
You don't have to fully understand the intricacies of assembly language to see that this
polymorphic comparison is much heavier than the simple monomorphic integer com-
parison from earlier. Let's conrm this hypothesis again by writing a quick Core_bench
test with both functions:
open Core
open Core_bench
let polymorphic_compare () =
let cmp a b = Stdlib.(if a > b then a else b) in
for i = 0 to 1000 do
ignore(cmp 0 i)
done
let monomorphic_compare () =
let cmp (a:int) (b:int) = Stdlib.(if a > b then a else b) in
for i = 0 to 1000 do
ignore(cmp 0 i)
done
let tests =
[ "Polymorphic comparison", polymorphic_compare;
"Monomorphic comparison", monomorphic_compare ]
let () =
List.map tests ~f:(fun (name,test) -> Bench.Test.create ~name test)
|> Bench.make_command
|> Command.run
Running this shows quite a signicant runtime dierence between the two:
$ dune exec -- ./bench_poly_and_mono.exe -ascii -quota 1
Estimated testing time 2s (2 benchmarks x 1s). Change using '-quota'.
Name

Percentage
------------------------ ------------ ------------
Polymorphic comparison
4_050.20ns
100.00%
Monomorphic comparison
471.75ns
11.65%
We see that the polymorphic comparison is close to 10 times slower! These results
shouldn't be taken too seriously, as this is a very narrow test that, like all such mi-
crobenchmarks, isn't representative of more complex codebases. However, if you're
building numerical code that runs many iterations in a tight inner loop, it's worth
manually peering at the produced assembly code to see if you can hand-optimize it.
Accessing Stdlib Modules from Within Core
In the benchmark above comparing polymorphic and monomorphic comparison, you
may have noticed that we prepended the comparison functions with Stdlib. This is

480
The Compiler Backend: Bytecode and Native code
because the Core module explicitly redenes the > and < and = operators to be special-
ized for operating over int types, as explained in Chapter 15.1.4 (The Polymorphic
Comparator). You can always recover any of the OCaml standard library functions by
accessing them through the Stdlib module, as we did in our benchmark.
27.3.2
Debugging Native Code Binaries
The native code compiler builds executables that can be debugged using conventional
system debuggers such as GNU gdb. You need to compile your libraries with the -g
option to add the debug information to the output, just as you need to with C compilers.
Extra debugging information is inserted into the output assembly when the library
is compiled in debug mode. These include the CFI stubs you will have noticed in the
proling output earlier (.cfi_start_proc and .cfi_end_proc to delimit an OCaml
function call, for example).
Understanding Name Mangling
So how do you refer to OCaml functions in an interactive debugger like gdb? The rst
thing you need to know is how OCaml function names compile down to symbol names
in the compiled object les, a procedure generally called name mangling.
Each OCaml source le is compiled into a native object le that must export a
unique set of symbols to comply with the C binary interface. This means that any
OCaml values that may be used by another compilation unit need to be mapped onto
a symbol name. This mapping has to account for OCaml language features such as
nested modules, anonymous functions, and variable names that shadow one another.
The conversion follows some straightforward rules for named variables and func-
tions:
• The symbol is prexed by caml and the local module name, with dots replaced by
underscores.
• This is followed by a double __ sux and the variable name.
• The variable name is also suxed by a _ and a number. This is the result of the
lambda compilation, which replaces each variable name with a unique value
within the module. You can determine this number by examining the -dlambda
output from ocamlopt.
Anonymous functions are hard to predict without inspecting intermediate compiler
output. If you need to debug them, it's usually easier to modify the source code to
let-bind the anonymous function to a variable name.
Interactive Breakpoints with the GNU Debugger
Let's see name mangling in action with some interactive debugging using GNU gdb.
Let's write a mutually recursive function that selects alternating values from a list.
This isn't tail-recursive, so our stack size will grow as we single-step through the
execution:

27.3 Interactive Breakpoints with the GNU Debugger

completion. GDB has a host of other features we won't cover here, but you can view
more guidelines via Mark Shinwell's talk on Real-world debugging in OCaml.5
One very useful feature of OCaml native code is that C and OCaml share the same
stack. This means that GDB backtraces can give you a combined view of what's going
on in your program and runtime library. This includes any calls to C libraries or even
callbacks into OCaml from the C layer if you're in an environment which embeds the
OCaml runtime as a library.

27.3 Perf
483
27.3.3
Proling Native Code
The recording and analysis of where your application spends its execution time is
known as performance proling. OCaml native code binaries can be proled just like
any other C binary, by using the name mangling described earlier to map between
OCaml variable names and the proler output.
Most proling tools benet from having some instrumentation included in the binary.
OCaml supports two such tools:
• GNU gprof, to measure execution time and call graphs
• The Perf6 proling framework in modern versions of Linux
Note that many other tools that operate on native binaries, such as Valgrind, will
work just ne with OCaml as long as the program is linked with the -g ag to embed
debugging symbols.
Gprof
gprof produces an execution prole of an OCaml program by recording a call graph
of which functions call one another, and recording the time these calls take during the
program execution.
Getting precise information out of gprof requires passing the -p ag to the native
code compiler when compiling and linking the binary. This generates extra code that
records prole information to a le called gmon.out when the program is executed.
This prole information can then be examined using gprof.
Perf
Perf is a more modern alternative to gprof that doesn't require you to instrument the
binary. Instead, it uses hardware counters and debug information within the binary to
record information accurately.
Run Perf on a compiled binary to record information rst. We'll use our write
barrier benchmark from earlier, which measures memory allocation versus in-place
modication:
$ perf record -g ./barrier_bench.native

This trace broadly reects the results of the benchmark itself. The mutable bench-
mark consists of the combination of the call to test_mutable and the caml_modify
write barrier function in the runtime. This adds up to slightly over half the execution
time of the application.
Perf has a growing collection of other commands that let you archive these runs and
compare them against each other. You can read more on the home page7.
Using the Frame Pointer to Get More Accurate Traces
Although Perf doesn't require adding in explicit probes to the binary, it does need to
understand how to unwind function calls so that the kernel can accurately record the
function backtrace for every event. Since Linux 3.9 the kernel has had support for
using DWARF debug information to parse the program stack, which is emitted when
the -g ag is passed to the OCaml compiler. For even more accurate stack parsing, we
need the compiler to fall back to using the same conventions as C for function calls.
On 64-bit Intel systems, this means that a special register known as the frame pointer
is used to record function call history. Using the frame pointer in this fashion means
a slowdown (typically around 3-5%) since it's no longer available for general-purpose
use.
OCaml thus makes the frame pointer an optional feature that can be used to improve
the resolution of Perf traces. opam provides a compiler switch that compiles OCaml
with the frame pointer activated:
$ opam switch create 4.13+fp ocaml-variants.4.13.1+options
ocaml-option-fp
Using the frame pointer changes the OCaml calling convention, but opam takes care
of recompiling all your libraries with the new interface.

27.3 Embedding Native Code in C
485
27.3.4
Embedding Native Code in C
The native code compiler normally links a complete executable, but can also output a
standalone native object le just as the bytecode compiler can. This object le has no
further dependencies on OCaml except for the runtime library.
The native code runtime is a dierent library from the bytecode one, and is installed
as libasmrun.a in the OCaml standard library directory.
Try this custom linking by using the same source les from the bytecode embedding
example earlier in this chapter:
$ ocamlopt -output-obj -o embed_native.o embed_me1.ml embed_me2.ml
$ gcc -Wall -I `ocamlc -where` -o final.native embed_native.o main.c \
-L `ocamlc -where` -lasmrun -ltermcap -lm -ldl
$ ./final.native
Before calling OCaml
hello embedded world 1
hello embedded world 2
After calling OCaml
The embed_native.o is a standalone object le that has no further references to
OCaml code beyond the runtime library, just as with the bytecode runtime. Do re-
member that the link order of the libraries is signicant in modern GNU toolchains
(especially as used in Ubuntu 11.10 and later) that resolve symbols from left to right
in a single pass.
Activating the Debug Runtime
Despite your best eorts, it is easy to introduce a bug into some components, such as C
bindings, that causes heap invariants to be violated. OCaml includes a libasmrund.a
variant of the runtime library which is compiled with extra debugging checks that
perform extra memory integrity checks during every garbage collection cycle. Running
these extra checks will abort the program nearer the point of corruption and help isolate
the bug in the C code.
To use the debug library, just link your program with the -runtime-variant d ag:
$ ocamlopt -runtime-variant d -verbose -o hello.native hello.ml
+ as
-o 'hello.o' '/tmp/build_cd0b96_dune/camlasmd3c336.s'
+ as
-o '/tmp/build_cd0b96_dune/camlstartup9d55d0.o'
'/tmp/build_cd0b96_dune/camlstartup2b2cd3.s'
+ gcc -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -pthread -Wall
-Wdeclaration-after-statement -fno-common
-fexcess-precision=standard -fno-tree-vrp -ffunction-sections
-Wl,-E
-o 'hello.native'
'-L/home/yminsky/.opam/rwo-4.13.1/lib/ocaml'

Summarizing the File Extensions
We've seen how the compiler uses intermediate les to store various stages of the
compilation toolchain. Here's a cheat sheet of all them in one place.
• .ml are source les for compilation unit module implementations.
• .mli are source les for compilation unit module interfaces. If missing, generated
from the .ml le.
• .cmi are compiled module interface from a corresponding .mli source le.
• .cmo are compiled bytecode object le of the module implementation.
• .cma are a library of bytecode object les packed into a single le.
• .o are C source les that have been compiled into native object les by the system
cc.
• .cmt are the typed abstract syntax tree for module implementations.
• .cmti are the typed abstract syntax tree for module interfaces.
• .annot are old-style annotation le for displaying typed, superseded by cmt les.
The native code compiler also generates some additional les.
• .o are compiled native object les of the module implementation.
• .cmx contains extra information for linking and cross-module optimization of the
object le.
• .cmxa and .a are libraries of cmx and o units, stored in the cmxa and a les respectively.
These les are always needed together.
• .S or .s are the assembly language output if -S is specied.
