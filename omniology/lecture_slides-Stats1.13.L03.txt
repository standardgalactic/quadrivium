Variables 
•  Variables can take on multiple values 
•  In contrast, a constant has only one value

Apples and gravity 
5 
Variables 
•  The size, shape, weight, and type of apple 
are all variables 
•  Gravity, or gravitational force, is a constant 
on Earth 
6 
Types of variables 
•  Nominal 
•  Ordinal 
•  Interval 
•  Ratio

Types of variables 
•  Nominal variables 
– Used to assign individual cases to categories 
•  For example, Coursera students come from many 
different countries 
•  Country of Origin is a nominal variable 
9 
Types of variables 
•  Ordinal variables 
– Used to rank order cases 
•  For example, countries may be ranked according to 
overall population 
•  Ranking is an ordinal variable  
10 
Types of variables 
•  Interval variables 
– Used to rank order cases and the distance, or 
interval, between each value is equal 
•  For example, each country has a longitude and 
latitude 
•  Longitude and Latitude are interval variables

Types of variables 
•  Ratio variables 
– The same as interval variables but they have 
a “true zero” 
•  For example, Population (Population = 0 = extinct) 
•  For example, Age (Age = 0 literally means NO age) 
•  For example, Temperature K°  (the Kelvin scale)

Types of variables 
•  Preview of variables in this course 
– Discrete vs. continuous variables 
•  Nominal variables are discrete (categorical) 
•  Interval and ratio variables are continuous 
•  Ordinal variables are technically discrete but they 
are often treated as continuous in statistical 
analyses (more on this later)

Distributions: Histograms

Histograms 
•  A histogram is a type of graph used to 
display a distribution 
21 
Histograms 
•  Why start with histograms? 
– To overcome the natural tendency to rely 
upon summary information, such as an 
average 
22 
An example: Body 
temperature

An example: Body

Histograms 
•  Histograms can reveal information not 
captured by summary statistics 
– Suppose a few children in a school are sick 
with influenza (flu) and have a high 
temperature 
•  The distribution will be positively skewed 
25 
An example: Body 
temperature 
26 
An example: Body 
temperature 
27 
Histograms 
•  Not all distributions are normal 
– Suppose one group of children had the flu a 
week prior to a second sick group of children 
– Assume the first group received antiobiotics, 
which temporarily caused their body 
temperatures to be slightly below normal, while 
the second group was still above normal

Histograms 
•  Not all distributions are normal 
– Simply viewing a histogram often reveals 
whether a distribution is normal or not normal 
– However, sometimes it is hard to determine 
•  Summary statistics help in such cases 
33 
Histograms 
•  Not all distributions are normal 
– As you view more and more distributions you 
will get a better sense of what is normal and 
what is not normal 
– So, let’s look at more distributions

Wine tasting! 
35 
An example: Wine ratings 
•  Suppose that 100 wine experts rated the 
overall quality of 8 different wines on a 
scale of 1 to 100 
– Higher scores indicate higher quality 
 
36

An example: Wine ratings 
•  Suppose four countries submitted two 
wines each, one red and one white 
– Argentina  
– Australia 
– France 
– USA 
37 
An example: Wine ratings 
Malbec & Chardonnay 
Shiraz & Pinot Grigio

Bourdeaux & Sauvignon

Cabarnet & Reisling

– The ratings of the red wines are normal 
– The ratings of the whites are not normal

Segment summary 
•  Histograms are used to display 
distributions 
•  Many distributions are normal 
45 
Segment summary 
•  Some distributions are not normal, for 
example: 
– Bi-modal 
– Positively skewed 
– Negatively skewed 
– Uniform (platykurtic) 
– Leptokurtic

Scales of measurement 
52 

10/12/13	

14	

Scales 
•  Scales of measurement 
– For example, in the last segment body 
temperature was presented in both 
Fahrenheit and in Celsius 
•  Different scales but both measure temperature 
•  F° can be converted to C° and vice-versa 
53 
Scales 
•  In statistics, there is a standard scale  
– The Z scale  
•  Any score from any scale can be 
converted 
– To Z scores 
•  Allows for efficient communication 
54 
Z scores 
•  Z = (X – M) / SD 
•  X is a score on an original scale (raw score) 
•  M is the mean 
•  SD is the standard deviation  
55 
Z scores 
•  Z = (X – M) / SD 
•  The mean Z-score is Z = 0 
•  Positive Z scores are above average 
•  Negative Z scores are below average 
56

Body temperature F° 
57 
Body temperature C° 
58 
Body temperature Z 
59 
Z scores 
•  For example, assume M = 98.6, SD = .5  
•  Suppose an individual, X = 99.6 
•  Convert X to Z 
60 

10/12/13	

16	

Z scores 
•  Convert X to Z 
•  Z = (X – M) / SD 
•  Z = (99.6 – 98.6) / .5 = 2 
•  Z = 2 
61 
Percentile rank 
•  Percentile rank 
– The percentage of scores that fall at or below 
a score in a distribution 
•  Assume a normal distribution 
•  If Z = 0 then the percentile rank = 50th 
•  50 percent of the distribution falls below the mean 
62 
Body temperature Z 
63 
Segment summary 
•  The Z-scale is the standard scale in 
statistics 
•  Raw scores can be converted to Z-scores 
•  Z-scores can be used to find percentile 
rank 
•  Raw score ~ Z-score ~ Percentile rank
